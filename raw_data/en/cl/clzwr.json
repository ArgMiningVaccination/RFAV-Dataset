IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 iii Foreword With the publication of the Immunisation Handbook 2020 (the Handbook ), I would once again like to sincerely thank everyone involv ed in supporting, promoting or delivering immunisations to the people of New Zealand. This Handbook has been designed as a comprehensive source of information on immunisation, to support you in the work you do. Since the July 2017 edition of the Handbook , there has been one subsequent online edition, the 2017 (2nd ed) which included PHARMAC's revised vaccine eligibility criteria for certain individuals at increased risk of the relevant vaccine -preventable diseases. On 1 July 2020, further changes were made to the online Handbook to include PHARMAC funding for the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine to be given at ages 45 years and 65 years and also a change to the pneumococcal vaccination (PCV10) primary series with the 3 month dose no longer required. This 2020 edition of the Handbook covers the 1 October 2020 schedule and updates the disease chapters affected by this schedule change. These changes include a new immunisation event at age 12 months with the pneumococcal vaccination booster and the first measles, mumps and rubella vaccin ations given at this event by the second measles, mumps and rubella dose, varicella and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccinations given at age 15 months . As well as the schedule changes several chapters and appendices have been reviewed and update d. Never in our generation has there been a greater need to have high immunisation coverage than in 2020 when New Zealand and the world are dealing with the COVID -19 pandemic. To quote the World Health Organization 'Immunisation is one of modern medicine 's greatest success stories. V accination has greatly reduced the burden of infectious diseases. Only clean water, also considered to be a basic human right, performs better '. At a population level, the effects of increasing immunisation coverage are clearl y discernible, with fewer cases of vaccine -preventable diseases as coverage increases. In New Zealand, we have seen significant decline in hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, genital warts and, in infants, pneumococcal and rotavirus diseases since the introduction of vaccines. Closing our immunisation equity gaps is essential for all scheduled vaccinations if we are to continue to maintain high immunisation coverage and to maintain our measles elimination status. In July 2020 the Mini stry of Health launched a one -year measles vaccination campaign with a focus on our known measles vaccination ga p in those aged 15 to 29 years. I congratulate the health community on the past immunisation achievements and encourage your ongoing commitment to improving immunisation coverage and reducing vaccine -preventable diseases in New Zealand. Pharmacists can now also assist with achieving this goal and in 2020 it has been particularly pleasing to see the number of funded influenza vaccinations given by pharmacist vaccinators ha s more than doubled those given in previous years. iv IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Immunisation is an important opportunity for health professionals to interact with people from all walks of life: mothers with newborns, school -age children and adults either wor king or retired. Your attitude and the conversations you have with people affect their attitudes toward immunisation and their engagement with the health care system in general. We hope this Handbook will support your interactions with your patients and th eir families/whnau. In closing, I would like to thank the members of the Handbook Advisory Group who updated the Handbook . I trust this edition, like its predecessors, will prove a valuable resource for health professionals. Ng mihi.

These guidelines are based on the best scientific evide nce available at the time of publication, from published and unpublished literature. The information contained within the Handbook was correct at the time of publication. This edition of the Handbook will remain current unless amended electronically via t he Ministry of Health website ( www.health.govt.nz/our - work/preventative -health -wellness/immunisation ) or until the next edition or update is published. Changes to the Handbook in 2020 All chapters have been updated and revised since the 2017 edition (2nd edition, 2018). The following changes have been made. Changes have been made to the anaphylaxis and emergency management section (section 2.3.3) in chapter 2 'Processes for safe immunisation ' and Appendix A4.2 'Resuscitation requirements for all authorised vaccinators and pharmacy vaccinators '. Chapter 4 'Immunisation for special groups ' has been rearranged and updated. Tables 4.3 -4.6 have been updated. With the introduction of the 12 -month immunisation event, the measles, mumps, rubella and pneumococcal chapters have been updated accordingly. Chapter 16 'Pneumococcal disease ' has also been updated, to reflect the two -dose primary series of PCV10 and earlier booster at 12 months. Chapter 13 'Meningococcal disease ' has been updated to include recommendations on the use of the recombinant gr oup B meningococcal vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero). Following discontinuation of Td vaccine (ADT -Booster), the tetanus and diphtheria chapters have been updated to include recommendations on Tdap for adults. MMR, varicella and zoster vaccines are recommended to be administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously as indicated (see section 2.2.3). Changes have been made to the following vaccine abbrevia tions - Hib-PRP, MenACWY, 2 HANDBOOK 2020 The National Immunisation Schedule The National Immunisation Schedule (the Schedule) is the series of publicly funded vaccines available in New Zealand (see Table 1 ). Some vaccines are also offered as part of an extended immunisation programme for targeted special groups in response to a recognised need (see Table 2 ). See also section 2.1.7 for a summary of the primary immunisation re quirements for adults (funded) and other funded and unfunded recommendations for this age group. On 1 July 2012, the management and purchasing of vaccines transferred from the Ministry of Health to PHARMAC. All publicly funded vaccines are now listed on PHARMAC 's Pharmaceutical Schedule (see www.pharmac.govt.nz ), and the district health boards (DHBs) are responsible for funding these once PHARMAC has listed them. PHARMAC considers medicine and vaccine funding app lications from pharmaceutical suppliers, health professionals, consumer groups and patients. Usually, manufacturers/ suppliers decide whether to make an application for funding. Normally this will follow registration and approval of the medicine or vaccine by Medsafe. PHARMAC will generally only consider an application for a medicine or vaccine to be funded once it has been registered and approved by Medsafe. Following a vaccine funding application, PHARMAC will assess the vaccine, seek clinical input (for vaccines this may be from the immunisation subcommittee of the Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee [PTAC] or from PTAC itself), and conduct an economic analysis. The recommendations from the immunisation subcommittee are then considered by PT AC, which will provide advice to PHARMAC. PHARMAC then decides what priority the application has for funding and consults with the Ministry of Health on capacity and implementation issues that may be associated with introducing a new vaccine. Depending on the outcome of that process, PHARMAC may then negotiate with the supplier. If an agreement is reached, PHARMAC will consult with the health sector on a funding proposal. The Ministry of Health remains responsible for and manages the National Immunisation Programme, which: aims to prevent disease through vaccination and to achieve coverage that prevents outbreaks and epidemics is accountable for achieving the Immunisation Health Target monitors disease burden and those at risk provides guidance to the secto r on immunisation, cold chain and resources ensures immunisation providers deliver services that meet the needs of their population implements the National Immunisation Schedule delivers trusted and effective vaccine programmes provides immunisation resour ces, including the Immunisation Handbook IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 3 improves information and data systems manages the National Immunisation Register (NIR). The Ministry of Health works with PHARMAC to ensure there is a strong link between vaccine decisions, management and the Natio nal Immunisation Programme. Although funding decisions will be communicated to the sector, vaccinators are advised to regularly check the Pharmaceutical Schedule and any online updates (see www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for changes to funding decisio ns, and (available at www.health.govt.nz/our -work/preventative -health - wellness/immunisation ) for the latest immunisation information. Changes to the National Immunisation Schedule in 2020 Table 1 shows the 2020 National Immunisation Schedule, and Table 2 shows the vaccines funded for special groups at higher risk of some diseases. Changes to vaccine funding in 2020 are as follows: From 2020, the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Afluria Quad; see chapter 11 'Influenza' ) will be the Schedule vaccine for eligible individuals, including pregnant women and adults aged 65 years and older. An immunisation event has been introduced at age 12 months. This enables two doses of MMR to be given in the second year of life, replacing t he MMR dose that was previously given at age 4 years. PCV10 (Synflorix) will now be given at age 6 weeks, 5 months and 12 months (ie, 2+1 schedule, omitting the 3 months dose and bringing the booster dose in the second year of life from 15 months to 12 mon ths). The extended immunisation programme for targeted special groups (using PCV13 and 23PPV) remains unchanged, except that eligibility has been extended to children age 5 -18 years who had received at least two (rather than four) doses of PCV10. DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV) will continue to be given age 4 years. Tdap (Boostrix) will replace Td at the 45 -year and 65 -year events and for tetanus -prone wounds. 4 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 1: National Immunisation 6 weeks 3 months 5 months 12 months 15 months b 4 years 11 or 12 yearsc 2 dosesc 45 years d 65 years annually e a.

Funded only for adults who have not received 4 previous doses of tetanus vaccine . e. One dose of ZV is funded for anyone age 65 years on or after 1 April 2018. There is a catch -up programme until 31 December 202 1, with 1 dose of ZV funded for individuals aged 66 -80 years, inclusive. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5 2020 changes to extended immunisation programme for special groups Vaccines funded for special groups are described in Table 2 below. Changes to existing programmes in 2020 are as follows. 1. Tdap vaccine funding for pregnant women was extended in 2019, it is now recommended to be given from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester. (Funded when giv en any time in the second or third trimester.) 2. A single dose of Tdap is funded for parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or special care baby unit for more than 3 days, who had not been exposed to maternal vacc ination at least 14 days prior to birth. 3. A single dose of Meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY -D) is funded for individuals aged between 13 and 25 years entering or in their first year of living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, mil itary barracks, or prisons. 6 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 2: Extended immunisation programme for special groups - vaccines funded in addition to the routine schedule Note: Vaccinators are advised to regularly check the Pharmaceutical Schedule and any online updates (www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for changes to funding decisions for special groups.

The immunisation benefit is paid by DHBs to providers for the administration of: all childhood Schedule vaccines influenza vaccine to eligible children and adults (ie, those at higher risk of disease) ZV to individuals at age 65 years and for catch -up (until 31 December 202 1) of individuals aged 66 -80 years, inclusive tetanus -diphtheria -pertussis (Tdap) boosters given at ages 45 and 65 years (now funded) hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Hib -PRP-T, human papillomavirus polysaccharide, and varicella vaccines only, for eligible children and adults (ie, at higher risk of disease) as part of an extended immunisation programme for special groups. The Health and Disability Services Eligibility Direction 2011 (the Eligibility Direction) issued by the Minister of Health sets out the eligibility criteria for publicly funded health and disability services in New Zealand. Only people who meet the eligibility criteria defined in the Eligibility Direction can receiv e publicly funded (ie, free or subsidised) health and disability services. Regardless of their immigration and citizenship status, all children aged under 18 years are eligible to receive Schedule vaccines, and providers can claim the immunisation benefit for administering the vaccines. All children are also eligible for Well Child Tamariki Ora services. Non-residents who were aged under 18 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the course, even if they are aged 18 year s or older when they complete it. Further information on eligibility can be found on the Ministry of Health website (www.health.govt.nz/eligibility ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11 Notifiable diseases All diseases preventable by va ccines on the Schedule (or as part of a targeted programme) are notifiable, except for HPV, seasonal influenza, rotavirus, are notifiable as acute gastroenteritis. It is a legal requirement (under the Health Act 1956) that health professionals notify their local medical officer of health of any notifiable disease they suspect or diagnose so that appropriate action (eg, public health prevention and control activities) can be undertaken. Notification processes, and the diseases to which they relate, have been updated in the Health Act and supporting Health (Infectious and Notifiable Diseases) Regulations 2016. See the Ministry of Health 's 2017 document Guidance on Infectiou s Disease Management under the Health Act 1956 (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/guidance -infectious -disease -management - under -health-act-1956 ) for an explanation, as well as the processes and forms for notifiable diseases. The case denitions used by the medical ofcer of health to classify the notied case for surveillance purposes (and to assist in identifying appropriate prevention and control activities) and the laboratory tests required to conrm the diagnosis can be found in the Communicable Disease Control Manual . For the most up -to-date information, refer to the online version (available General immunisation principles It is not necessary to have an in -depth knowledge of the immune system to understand the first principles of vaccinology. The immune system is an extremel y complex inter -connected system, but understanding certain aspects involved in the process of inducing specific immunity through vaccination inform vaccination practice. As protective immunity develops over time, the timing of vaccine doses, along with a basic understanding of the different types of vaccines, becomes important. 1.1 Immunity and immunisation Immunity is the biological state of being able to resist disease or a toxin: the primary objective of vaccination is to induce an immunological memory against specific diseases, so that if exposure to a disease -causing pathogen occurs, the immune response will neutralise the infection or toxins it releases before disease can occur. 1.1.1 Immune recognition One of the primary ways in which the immune system achieves elimination of pathogens and other unwanted foreign material is being able to distinguish 'self' from 'non-self'. Each cell in the body is equipped with a type of molecule that identifies the individual from any other, much like a 3D barcode. Pathogens not only lack the individual 's 'self' marker, they also contain 'virulence factors ' that alert the immune system to danger. Antigens ( antibody generators) are the drivers of the specific immune response. Antigens are molecular sha pes, such as part of a protein or glycoprotein, that the immune system recognises as foreign and can trigger an adaptive immune response. While some vaccines contain the entire weakened or attenuated organism (live viral vaccines like measles, mumps and ru bella vaccines), increasingly, newer vaccines contain purified or recombinant protein antigens (as in acellular pertussis, HPV or pneumococcal vaccines). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 13 The first process that occurs when a foreign antigen, such as a vaccine antigen, is introduced to the body is the recognition that the antigen is non -self by triggering an inflammatory response. The antigen is taken up at the local site (such as the injection site) by specialist phagocytic cells called antigen -presenting cells - macrophages and dendritic cells. Once inside the antigen -presenting cells, the foreign protein (or microbe) is dismantled into tiny fragments that are displayed on cell surface alongside a 'self' molecule. These antigen -presenting cells carry the antigen to through the lymph to the local lymph node where the adaptive immune response is initiated. 1.1.2 Induction of the adaptive immune response The response that occurs the first time an antigen is 'seen' by the immune system is called the primary immune response. The adaptive immune responses occur in lymphoid tissue, primarily in the spleen and in the 500 -600 lymph nodes distributed throughout the body. The adaptive immune response to most vaccines oc curs at the draining lymph node proximal to the site of injection. The spleen and lymph nodes are densely populated with important effector lymphocytes of the immune response: T -cells and B -cells. In the lymph node, the vaccine antigen is presented to the specific T -cells and B -cells. Among the trillions of specific T and B lymphocytes (there are ~1016 possibilities), there usually exists a match for the antigen. Cells that recognise the antigen are activated through communication with the antigen presenti ng cell and the primary immune response can be initiated. This process and the response matures over a period of four to six weeks. An early outcome of the interaction between these antigen -presenting cells and T and B lymphocytes is the production of ant ibody -producing B -cells. Antibody can be measured in the blood as soon as 4 -7 days after this interaction, but is usually more effectively measured weeks to months later. Initially, this is low in quantity and of low affinity for the antigen (it binds weak ly to the antigen), and primarily consists of the antibody subtype immunoglobulin M (IgM), often referred to as 'early antibody '. It peaks at around 10 days then declines relatively quickly (see Figure 1.1). For most vaccine -preventable diseases this process is too slow following infection, and disease occurs before an effective immune response can be mounted. Injecting a part or a weakened version of th e pathogen in the form of a vaccine, readies the immune system so that it can mount a more rapid and effective response when the wild disease is encountered. 14 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 1.1.3 Development of immune memory and the secondary response The response that occurs the second time an antigen is 'seen' by the immune system is called the secondary immune response. During the primary immune response, over a period of around two months, cells that are less specific for the specific antigen are d eleted, and those that are highly specific are retained and multiply within the lymph node. Antibody production also switches from IgM to more specific IgG or IgA subtypes. During this time immunological memory cells also develop, but it takes around four months, after the initial antigen is cleared, to fully form immune memory. The next time the same antigen is introduced, either as a pathogen component or as a further dose of vaccine, the immunological memory cells that recognise it will be activated and begin to proliferate. Highly specific antibody (primarily of the IgG subtype, but also IgA) is rapidly produced in large amounts. The lag phase is much shorter than the primary immune response (see Figure 1.1), at just 1 -4 days; the antibody level peaks very quickly and lasts much longer. The immune system has been readied by the vaccine; if the actual disease pathogen enters the body, then it is recognised promptly and neutralised by the immune system preventing it from causing disease. Figure 1.1: Comparison of primary and secondary immune responses to protein - containing vaccines Secondary respons es are faster (peaking at day 7) than the primary immune response and the antibody titres are higher, more prolonged and of higher neutralising capacity. Innate immunity Most infectious microbes (also known as micro -organisms) are prevented from entering the body by barriers such as skin, mucosa, cilia and a range of anti -microbial enzymes. Any microbes that breach these surface barriers are then attacked by other components of the innate immune system, such as polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutro phils), macrophages and complement. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 15 This innate immune response is a pre -programmed non -specific response that does not involve learnt or adaptive mechanisms. The cells and proteins of the innate immune system can recognise common microbial markers or vir ulence factors and can kill microbes without the need for prior exposure. The chemical messages (cytokines) and cells of the innate immune system also interact with the cells of the adaptive immune system (eg, lymphocytes) to induce a cascade of events tha t leads to adaptive, antigen -specific immunity and immune memory, as summarised in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Summary of non-specific innate and adaptive (specific) immunity 1.1.4 Acquisition of adaptive immunity Specific immunity can be actively produced by directly responding to an antigen. This is termed adaptive or learnt immunity, in which the immune system learns to respo nd to specific antigens. Passive immunity is provided by transferring antibody from an immune person to temporarily protect another. Naturally acquired immunity Naturally acquired immunity occurs either actively by experiencing the infection or passively through the transfer of maternal antibodies from mother to fetus or infant (transplacentally or in breastmilk). Artificially acquired immunity 'Artificially ' acquired immunity occurs either actively through vaccination or passively through administration of immunoglobulin (IG) (see Appendix 6 ). While actively acquired i mmunity lasts from years to life, passively acquired immunity lasts from weeks to months as the transferred antibodies decay and are not renewed. 16 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 1.1.5 Maternally derived immunity The passive transfer of antibody from mother to fetus provides an opportunity to provide protection to the neonate against several diseases before they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Maternal vaccination boosts the immunity of the mother, inducing high levels of maternal antibody. This antibody is actively transported acro ss the placenta to concentrate at protective levels by birth (in term infants). Important diseases that maternal vaccination is effective at preventing include neonatal tetanus, influenza and pertussis in the infant for the first weeks or months of life ( see section 4.1 and the relevant disease chapters). 1.1.6 Summary Successful immune responses occur following the recognition of, and appropriate response to, a foreign antigen. Specialised but non -specific cells, called antigen -presenting cells, take up, transport and present the vaccine antigen to antigen -specific T -cells and B -cells within the lymph nodes and spleen. The first wave of antibodies produced are sh ort lived and of low affinity. Immune memory takes at least four months to fully develop, but the antibody and memory cells that arise are of high affinity. Immune memory can be boosted. This is called a secondary immune response. Adaptive immunity is lear nt and acquired actively through disease or vaccination. Passive immunity is acquired through maternal transfer and administration of IG. Maternal vaccination offers passive protection to infants for the first weeks or months of life. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 17 1.2 From personal protec tion to community (herd) immunity By protecting individuals, vaccination can also protect the wider community. This herd immunity occurs when the vaccine coverage is high, meaning an infectious case is unlikely to encounter susceptible contacts, so transmi ssion stops. The whole population benefits when a vaccine prevents carriage and transmission of a human -only pathogen, such as polio virus, measles virus or Streptococcus pneumoniae , and circulation of these pathogens can be reduced and even eliminated. T his phenomenon, called herd or community immunity, can prevent infections spreading and therefore protect vulnerable members of the population, such as the very young, the very old, or those with underlying conditions that increase their risk from infectio us diseases (ie, the immunocompromised). These individuals may not themselves be able to receive some vaccines (eg, live vaccines) or may not mount a sufficiently effective immune response to other vaccines. The population benefits depend on the disease i tself, the nature of the vaccine and the proportion or target group of the population needed to be immunised to prevent the disease from spreading. A recent example of herd immunity in New Zealand is the significant reduction in rotavirus hospital discharg e rates in children aged under 5 years following the July 2014 introduction of rotavirus vaccine for infants (see section 18.3.2 ). 1.2.1 Reproduction number and herd immunity threshold A measure of the infectiousness of a disease is the basic reproduction number (R 0). This is the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual when the rest of the population is susceptible. In other words, R 0 describes the spreading potential of an infection in a population.1 Measles is one of the most infectious diseases, with an R 0 of 12 -18 (Table 1.1). In other words, one person with measles is likely to infect up to 18 other susceptible people. Pertussis is similarly infectious. If a significant proportion of the population are immune, then the chain of disease transmission is likely to be disrupted. The herd immunity threshold (H) is the proportion of immune individuals in a population that must be exceeded to prevent disease transmission. For example, to prevent measles or pertussis transmission, 92-94 percent of the population must be immune ( Table 1.1). 18 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 R0 must remain above 1 for an infection to continue to exist. Once R 0 drops below 1 (such as in the presence of an effective vaccination programm e), the disease can be eliminated. The greater the proportion of the population that is immune to the infection, the lower the R 0 will be. For example, data2 indicates that a quadrivalent HPV vaccine programme with 70 percent coverage in young women may lead to the near disappearance of genital warts from the heterosexual population because the R 0 for HPV types 6 and 11 (causing genital warts) falls to below 1 (see 'Herd immunity and population impact ' in section 10.4.2 ). Table 1.1: Approximate basic reproduction numbers (in developed countries) and implied crude herd immunity thresholdsa for common vaccine -preventable diseasesb Infection Basic reproduction number (R0) Crude herd Notes a. The herd immunity threshold (H) is calculated as 11/R 0. b. The values given in this table are approximate: they do not properly reflect the range and diversity among populations, nor do they reflect the full immunological complexity underlying the epidemiology and persistence of these infe ctions. c. The R 0 of influenza viruses varies among subtypes. d. This is complicated by uncertainties over immunity to infection and variation related to hygiene standards.

Table 77.2. 1.2.2 Summary Not only do vaccines provide individual protection, but for many of the diseases we vaccinate against, there is also a population effect called herd/community immunity. Some diseases are extremely infectious and require a very high proportion of the community to be immune to prevent transmission (particularly measles and pertussis). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 19 1.3 The importance of immunisation coverage High immunisation coverage means more individuals are protected; it is also vital for achieving herd immunity. High coverage reduces the spread of disease to those who have not been vaccinated for medical reasons (eg, children with le ukaemia while receiving treatment) or because of age (eg, infants who are too young to respond to some vaccines). High coverage also reduces the spread of disease to those who may not mount an effective immune response to vaccines because of an underlying condition (eg, those on immunosuppressive regimes). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the New Zealand government target for immunisation coverage (since 2017/18) is for at least 95 percent of children to be fully vaccinated by age 2 years. The New Z ealand target includes a marker for on -time immunisation of 95 percent by age 8 months, as well as at ages 2 years and 5 years. This target is based on the need for: on-time immunisation coverage, particularly three doses of pertussis -containing vaccine f or infants in the primary series and the first dose of measles vaccine at age 12 months achieving high herd immunity, particularly to prevent measles transmission. For the three months ending 31 March 2020, 91 percent of New Zealand children were fully im munised by age 8 months and 92 percent were fully immunised by age 2 years. Up-to-date national and DHB immunisation coverage data is available at the Ministry of website ( www.health.govt.nz/our -work/preventative -health - wellness/immunisation/immunisation -coverage/national -and-dhb-immunisation - data Classification of vaccines There are three broad cate gories of vaccine type: live attenuated (weakened), inactivated or whole killed, and subunit. Examples of the different types of vaccines are summarised in Table 1.2. 20 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 1.2: Classification of vaccines, with examples Polysaccharide: pneumococcal (23 C and papillomavirus meningococcal B Other subunit: pertussis, acellular influenza Note: Travel vaccines have been omitted from the above table. 1.4.1 Live attenuated vaccines Live vaccines contain pathogens, usually viruses, which have been weakened (attenuated) so that they are able to replicate enough to induce an immune response but not cause disease. Immunity from live vaccines is usually very long -lived. The live vaccines on the National Immunisation Schedule are MMR, varicella, rotavirus and herpes zoster vaccines. 1.4.2 Killed and inactivated vaccines Killed vaccines contain whole bacteria that have been killed. The whole -cell pertussis vaccine is an example of a killed vaccine. There are no killed vaccines on the Schedule. Inactivated vaccines cont ain viruses that have been inactivated in some way, such as splitting, so they are unable to replicate or cause disease. Examples of inactivated vaccines are influenza, hepatitis A and polio vaccines. 1.4.3 Subunit vaccines Subunit vaccines contain microbial fr agments or particles that can induce an immune response which protects against disease. These are produced using a range of methods including recombinant engineering, detoxification processes and splitting and purification. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 21 Toxoid vaccines In some bacterial infections (eg, diphtheria and tetanus), the clinical manifestations of disease are caused not by the bacteria themselves but by the toxins they secrete. Toxoid vaccines are produced by harvesting a toxin and altering it chemically (usually with formaldehyde) to convert the toxin to a toxoid. The toxoid is then purified. Toxoid vaccines induce antibodies that neutralise the harmful exotoxins released from these bacteria. Recombinant vaccines Recombinant vaccines, such as those used against hepati tis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), are made using a gene from the (disease -causing) pathogen. The gene is inserted into a cell system capable of producing large amounts of the protein of interest. The protein produced can generate a protecti ve immune response. For example, the gene for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is inserted into yeast cells, which replicate and produce large amounts of HBsAg. This antigen is purified and used to make vaccine. The advantage of this approach is tha t it results is a very pure vaccine that is efficient to produce. Polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines Polysaccharides are strings of sugars. Some bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis , have large amounts of polysaccharide on their surface, which encapsulate the bacteria. The polysaccharide capsules protect the bacteria from the host 's immune system and can make the bacteria more virulent. Historically, it has been difficult to stimulate an effective immune response to thes e polysaccharide capsules using vaccines, particularly in children aged under 2 years. First-generation capsular polysaccharide vaccines contained antigens isolated from the different polysaccharide capsules (eg, 23PPV, see chapter 16). Polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic, and they only induce a primary immune response. They produce low affinity antibodies (which do not bind well to the antigen) and, beca use they do not elicit T -cell responses, immune memory is not strong. Multiple priming doses (even a single dose) can cause hyporesponsiveness in both children and adults to further doses. There is also concern that repeated doses could result in 'clonal deletion ' where the specific B -cell pool becomes depleted due to successive primary responses. Polysaccharide conjugate vaccines (eg, Hib -PRP, PCV13 and MenACWY) contain carrier proteins that are chemically attached to the polysaccharide antigens. Attachin g relatively non -immunogenic polysaccharides to the highly immunogenic carrier proteins results in activation of a T -cell response; in this way, conjugate vaccines induce both high -affinity antibodies against the polysaccharide antigens, and immune memory, and can be used in infants. 22 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Examples of carrier proteins and vaccines that use them are: tetanus toxoid, used in Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine (Hib -PRP-T; Hiberix) a non -toxic recombinant variant of diphtheria toxin used in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13; vaccine (MenACWY Menactra). by the number of polysaccharides that can be covalent ly linked to the carrier molecule, so there is still a role for polysaccharide vaccines to broaden the number of serotypes recognised. For example, PCV13 has 13 serotypes, compared to 23PPV with 23 serotypes. Polysaccharide vaccines are expected to be phas ed out eventually with improvements to conjugate vaccine technology and other vaccine technologies. Principles and implications for using polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines Because of their improved immune response, where possible use polysaccharide - protein conjugate vaccines in preference to polysaccharide -only vaccines. To ensure broad protection against disease, use a conjugate vaccine to prime the immune system before using the polysaccharide vaccine to increase the number of serotypes recognised. F or example, high -risk children are primed with PCV13 then boosted with 23PPV (see section 16.5.2 ). To avoid or minimise hyporesponsiveness, individua ls should have a maximum of three lifetime doses of polysaccharide vaccine. Children aged under 2 years should not receive polysaccharide vaccines as they are likely to be ineffective in young children. 1.4.4 Summary Vaccines introduce antigens to the immune system in the form of live, killed/ inactivated or subunit vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines do not induce immune memory and have been associated with hyporesponsiveness to later doses. Polysaccharide conjugate vaccines overcome these problems. 1.5 Vaccine ingredients In addition to the antigen, a vaccine may contain a range of other substances; for example, an immune enhancer (adjuvant) and/or a preservative. Traces of residual components from the manufacturing process may also be present in the vaccin e. For IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 23 further information on vaccine content, see chapter 3 and the vaccine sections within the disease chapters of this Handbook . 1.5.1 Adjuvants Adjuvants are substanc es that enhance the immune response to an antigen through a range of mechanisms, including improving the delivery of the antigen to the innate immune system and to the lymphoid organs. Use of adjuvants also means that less antigen, which can be difficult t o produce, is needed (this is called antigen sparing). Adjuvants licensed for human use include aluminium salts (eg, aluminium GSK). Most non -live vaccines require an adjuvant, and most vaccines still use aluminium adjuvants. The amount of aluminium contained in a vaccine is very small compared with that present in our daily intake from food and water, in cluding breastmilk. 1.5.2 Preservatives Preservatives prevent the contamination of vaccines, particularly in multi -dose vials. 2-phenoxyethanol is an example of a preservative used in some vaccines. It is also used in many cosmetics and baby care products. Many vaccines do not contain a preservative. Mercury -based preservatives (thiomersal/thimerosal) are not used in vaccines on the New Zealand National Immunisation Schedule, and multi -dose vials are not used for Schedule vaccinations. 1.5.3 Stabilisers Stabilisers p rotect the vaccine from adverse conditions (such as exposure to heat), inhibit chemical reactions and prevent components from separating. Examples include sucrose, lactose, albumin, gelatin, These are wetting agents that alter the surface tension of a liquid, like a detergent does. Surfactants assist particles to remain suspended in liquid, preventing settling and clumping. One commonly used surfactant is polysorbate 80, made from sorbitol (su gar alcohol) and oleic acid (an omega fatty acid). It is also commonly used in foods such as ice-cream. 24 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 1.5.5 Residuals Residuals are traces of substances that remain in the vaccine as an inevitable consequence of the manufacturing process. Regulatory bodies va ry as to which trace substances must be specified. Residuals may include virus -inactivating agents (such as formaldehyde), antibiotics and other substances used in the manufacturing process, such as ovalbumin (an egg protein) and gelatin. 1.6 Safety monitoring of vaccines in New Zealand 1.6.1 The approval of vaccines for use in New Zealand Vaccines, like all medicines, have benefits and risks of harm. Before a medicine or vaccine is approved for use, it must be tested in a series of clinical trials to deter mine its immunogenicity, efficacy and safety profile. The data from these trials is assessed and scrutinised by regulatory authorities, such as Medsafe in New Zealand, the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the US, before the medicine or vaccine is approved for use. Known information about each medicine and vaccine is published for health professionals in a manufacturer 's data sheet, available on the Medsafe website (www.medsafe.govt.nz ). Consumer medicine information is usually also published. Once the vaccine is used widely (ie, outside of the clinical trials), more information is collected on its safety profile and effective ness. Some adverse reactions are rare and may not be seen until a very large number (thousands or even millions) of people have received the medicine or vaccine. This is one of the reasons why it is important to monitor all medicines and vaccines after the y have been approved (registered). Note that some vaccines that are approved for use by Medsafe may not have been made available for distribution by the manufacturer or supplier. Most countries (including New Zealand) have a safety monitoring system, whic h includes a voluntary spontaneous reporting scheme, to help identify any possible safety concerns. These reporting systems feed into the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring, called the Uppsala Monitoring Centre in Sweden. This means that international data, often covering millions of doses, is available for Medsafe, which is the medicines regulator responsible for monitoring information to ensure that approved vaccines remain acceptably safe for use in New Zealand. Vaccine safety is never reviewed in isolation from the expected benefits of the vaccine; it is always looked at in terms of the risk -benefit balance. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 25 In addition, the WHO plays an important role in monitoring vaccine safety through its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts o n Immunization and the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety. 1.6.2 The New Zealand spontaneous reporting scheme Two terms are used to describe spontaneous reports in the context of vaccination. Adverse events are undesirable events experienced by a perso n, which may or may not be causally associated with the vaccine. Adverse reactions are undesirable effects resulting from medicines or vaccines (ie, they are causally associated). Spontaneous reports are case reports of adverse events that people have exp erienced while or after taking a medicine or having a vaccine. Medsafe contracts the collection, review and analysis of this information to the New Zealand Pharmacovigilance Centre at the University of Otago in Dunedin. Health care professionals and consu mers are encouraged to report adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM), which is part of the New Zealand Pharmacovigilance Centre. Pharmaceutical companies also submit adverse event reports. Furth er information about suspected adverse reactions (and events following immunisation) reported in New Zealand can be found in the Suspected Medicine Adverse Reaction Search on the Medsafe website (www.medsafe.govt.nz/safety/safety -monitoring.asp ). See below for details about how to report to CARM and what information should be reported. 1.6.3 AEFI reporting process - notifying CARM When obtaining conse nt for immunisation, vaccinators should also seek consent to report any adverse events that may occur, because AEFI reporting is considered part of immunisation programme quality control monitoring and public safety. How to report to CARM Adverse events m ay be reported to CARM through: the electronic adverse reaction reporting tool available in practice management software programmes online reporting at https://nzphvc.otago.ac.nz/report/ using the iPhone/i Pad iOS ADR reporting application (available at https://nzphvc.otago.ac.nz/app ) downloading and printing a reporting form (https://nzphvc.otago.ac.nz/reporting ), then mailing or email the completed form to the address below 26 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 completing a Freepost Yellow Card - available from CARM, or found in the MIMS New Ethicals and inside th e back cover of some editions of Prescriber Update by telephone, email or fax (see below). Outside office hours, a telephone -answering machine will take messages. Send reporting forms to: Freepost 112002 The Medical Assessor Centre for Adverse Reactions M onitoring University of Otago Medical School PO In terms of guidance, the sort of information the reporting form generally requires is a patient identifier (gender, age, initial), a medicine, a reaction and the reporte r's contact details. This information can also be accessed from the Medsafe website (revised 7 November 2019; www.medsafe.govt.nz/safety/report -a-problem.asp ). What should be reported ? Health professionals/vaccinators should report: all serious suspected AEFI and other reactions of clinical concern to established vaccines, such as those described in Table 1.3 below. The AEFIs should be reported regardless of whether they consider the event to have been caused by the vaccination, and they should still be reported even if the effect is well recognised all suspected adverse reactions (including minor r eactions) to newly introduced vaccines, or those being used for new indications or being delivered by a different route. Individuals or parents/guardians should be encouraged to notify vaccinators of any AEFI that they consider may have been caused by the vaccination. Alternatively, individuals or parents/guardians may wish to notify CARM themselves, or they can contact their general practice or the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC) on 0800 IMMUNE/0800 466 863 to help with notification. If in doubt, rep ort it. Table 1.3: Examples of AEFIs to be reported Timeframe Event All vaccines IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 27 Within 24 hours of vaccination Anaphylactic reaction (acute hypersensitivity reaction) Anaphylaxis Persistent inconsolable screaming (more than 3 hours) Hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode Fever >40 \u00b0C Within 5 days of vaccination Severe local reaction Sepsis Injection -site abscess Within 12 days of vaccination Seizures, including febrile seizures Encephalopathy Within 3 months of vaccination Acute flaccid paralysis* (AFP), including Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) Brachial neuritis (can occur around 2 -28 days after tetanus -containing vaccine) Thrombocytopenia (can occur around 15 -35 days after MMR) Between 1 and 12 months after BCG vaccination Lymphadenitis Disseminated BCG infection Osteitis/osteomyelitis No time limit Intussusception after rotavirus vaccine Any death, hospitalisation or other severe or unusual events of clinical concern that are thought by health professionals or the public to possibly be related to vaccination Newly introduced vaccines, or those with new indications or being delivered by a different route No time limit All suspected adverse reactions * AFP in children is also monitored by the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit as part of polio eradication surveillance (see chapter 17). Seriousness of AEFIs Reports of suspected adverse reactions or AEFIs can be categorised as serious or non - serious. This categorisation system is a tool used to try and prioritise safety concerns. It is not a reflection of the importance of the events to the consumer or their h ealth care professional. Because a report is defined as serious based on what is reported, it is possible to have both serious and non -serious cases reporting the same type of event; for example, headache. International convention defines the seriousness of reports based on the outcome or nature of the reported event as documented in the report, irrespective of whether there is any association to the medicine or vaccine . Serious events are based on the following international criteria: hospitalisation (or prolonged hospitalisation) of the patient life-threatening event persisting disability of the patient intervention required to prevent permanent impairment congenital anomaly 28 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 death of the patient. CARM assessment of causality The WHO recommends that indi vidual reports of adverse reactions to vaccines are assessed for causality. This assessment is a tool used to help detect new safety concerns; it is not a determination of whether a vaccine caused an adverse reaction. The person reporting the event will receive a letter of response from CARM commenting on the adverse effect, the causal relationship and the number of other similar events, and advice about future use of the vaccine in the individual. Also, where applicable, CARM will provide a validate d AEFI code to the NIR. The information provided by CARM: needs to be communicated to the individual and parent/guardian (if applicable) must be entered in the medical notes will help to identify those individuals who should receive follow -up vaccination in a controlled environment, such as a hospital. 1.6.4 What does Medsafe do with this information? Medsafe and CARM analyse spontaneous reports in conjunction with other information to determine whether there are any new potential safety signals. Medsafe seeks the advice of independent experts through the Medicines Adverse Reactions Committee or may form working groups of experts to provide advice. Medsafe works closely with other regulatory authorities from around the world. Medsafe undertakes a risk -benefit a ssessment of safety signals to decide if action is required. Further information on risk -benefit assessment is provided on the Medsafe website ( https:/ /www.medsafe.govt.nz/Consumers/Safety -of-Medicines/Medsafe - Evaluation -Process.asp ). Most safety signals are not supported by any additional information, and no action is taken, although Medsafe may continue to monitor the issue closely. A small number of possible safety signals are confirmed as real. In these cases, Medsafe has several regulatory actions it can take, including withdrawing the product. In New Zealand, it is less likely that any rare new side -effects to vaccines will be detected b ecause of the small number of people immunised compared to other countries. Therefore, Medsafe uses international data available from the WHO, other regulators and pharmaceutical companies to help assess any reports of rare events following immunisation an d to determine if they may be new events linked to immunisation. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 29 1.6.5 Advantages and limitations of spontaneous reports Spontaneous reports have been shown to be a very simple way of identifying potential or possible safety signals with medicines, and over 90 countries have a spontaneous reporting system. They can be used to monitor the safety of medicines in real -life use over the lifetime of the medicine, and for all types of people. The limitations of using spontaneous reports include under -reporting, a lac k of reliable information on the extent of use of the medicine and wide variations in the clinical details provided about the event and the history of the patient. Spontaneous reports are heavily subject to reporting bias, such as media or other attention on an issue. They are also not very effective at detecting adverse reactions that occur a long time after starting the medicine. For these reasons, such reports are only used to identify safety signals. These signals require further formal epidemiological study before they can be validated or discounted. Information obtained from spontaneous reports needs to be interpreted with caution. Understanding vaccine safety and spontaneous reporting Spontaneous report patterns can be variable, and they depend on m any factors. Summaries of reported events following immunisation are not lists of known or proven adverse reactions to vaccines. They cannot be used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions to vaccines in the whole population, and they cannot be use d to directly compare the relative safety of vaccines. They must not be interpreted and used as such. Health care professionals and consumers are encouraged to report any suspicions that an event they have experienced may have been caused by vaccination. Therefore, reports sent to CARM may be: real adverse reactions to the vaccine anxiety or nervousness about needles or the process of vaccination coincidental events that would have occurred anyway. With any vaccine, the adverse events that are generally r eported include: injection -site reactions well-recognised events, such as headaches, dizziness, muscle aches, mild fever and tiredness mild allergic reactions, such as mild rashes and itching rare but serious allergic reactions, called anaphylaxis, which c an occur in response to any medicine or vaccine and some foods - health care professionals giving vaccines are trained to recognise the symptoms of serious allergic reactions and promptly treat them immunisation stress -related responses due to fear or anti cipation of the needle injection (eg, fainting or hyperventilation) 30 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 coincidental medical conditions new adverse events (ie, those not already listed in the prescribing information [data sheet]). There will always be a few coincidental events reported because vaccines are given to large sections of the population. In some cases, vaccines are specifically targeted at people with underlying medical conditions (eg, the influenza vaccine). The challeng e is to be able to distinguish these coincidental 'background ' events from those that may have been caused by the vaccine. There are a range of research methods for assessing the risk of an event after a vaccine compared with the risk with no vaccine expos ure. The time between immunisation and an event can be important in determining whether the event was coincidental. Most reactions to vaccines occur within a very short time of immunisation, usually within days. Another important approach taken when asse ssing vaccine safety is comparing the number of reports for a specific event with the expected background rate for that event. When doing this, it is important to ensure that definite diagnoses of the events reported were made and to adjust the background rate for any differences in population groups and seasonal variations.3 References 1.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 31 2 Processes for safe immunisation This chapter provides information about: Pre-vaccination: cold chain management, informed consent, pre -vaccination screening, contraindications, spacing of doses, catch -up, and adult vaccination (section 2.1) Vaccine administration: preparation, route, vaccination techniques by age, and multiple injections ( section 2.2) Post-vaccination: post -vaccination advice, pain and fever recommendations, anaphylaxis and emergency management, and documentation and insurance (section 2.3). Who can administer a vaccine? Vaccines are prescription medicines, so they can only be administered by: a nurse practitioner a medical practitioner a registered midwife a designated prescriber (which includes a registered nurse fullling the designated prescriber criteria) a person authorised to administer the medicine in accordance with a prescription or a standing order. In the case of an approved immunisation programme, vaccines can be administered without a prescription or standing order by: a person who is authorised by either the Director -General of Health or a medical ofcer of health under Regulation 44A of the Medicines Regulations 1984 (see Appendix 4 ). Several vaccines have been considered by the M edicines Classification Committee and reclassified from prescription medicines to restricted medicines when administered by a registered pharmacist (who meets the conditions of the classification; see Appendi x 4, 'Pharmacist vaccinators' ). It is the reclassification of a vaccine to a restricted medicine that gives a pharmacist vaccinator the authority to administer the vaccine without a prescription. 32 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 2.1 Pre-vaccination The 'Immunisation standards for vaccinators ' and the 'Guidelines for organisations storing vaccines and/or offering immunisation services ' apply to the delivery of all Schedule vaccines and those not on the Schedule. See Appendix 3 . The vaccinator is responsible for ensuring all the vaccines they are handling and administering have been stored at the recommended temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C at all times (see 'Cold chain management ' below and National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) on vaccine presentation, preparation and disposal can be found in Appendix 7 . Vaccinators are expected to know and observe standard occupational health and sa fety guidelines to minimise the risk of spreading infection and needle -stick injury (see Appendix 7 ). All vaccinations on the New Zealand National Immunisation Sch edule are given parenterally (by injection) except for the rotavirus vaccine which is given non - parenterally (orally). For non -parenteral vaccine administration, follow the manufacturer 's instructions. 2.1.1 Cold chain management All vaccines must always be sto red and/or transported within the recommended temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. See the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) for detailed vaccine storage, transportation and destruction in formation (available at ' is defined as 'the system of transporting and storing vaccines within the recommended temperature range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C from the place of manufacture to the point of vaccine administration (the individual) '. The integri ty of the cold chain is dependent not only on the equipment used for storage, transportation and monitoring but also on the people involved and the processes/practices they undertake. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 33 Table 2.1: Key points for cold chain management All vaccinators are responsible for ensuring the vaccines they administer have been stored correctly. All immunisation providers storing vaccines must use a pharmaceutical refrigerator. The pharmaceutical refrigerator minimum and maximum temperatures must be monitored and recorded at the same time each working day. All immunisation providers must monitor the refrigerator with an electronic temperature recording device (eg, a data logger) that records and downloads data on a weekly basis. This should be compared with the daily minimum/maximum recordings. All immunisation providers who store vaccines and/or offer immunisation services must achieve Cold Chain Accreditation. Each immunisation provider must have a written cold chain management policy in place and ensure their policy is reviewed and updated annually. Each vaccinator is responsible to ensure they are able to access this policy, as it will contain important practi ce information on vaccine storage. If the vaccine refrigerator temperature goes outside the recommended +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range Label the vaccines 'not for use '. - If the refrigerator is currently running within the +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range, leave the labelled vaccines in your refrigerator. - If the refrigerator is not within the +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range, look for obvious reversible causes (door open, power interruption). If no cause found, pack your labelled vaccines into a chilly bin, with a temperature monitoring dev ice and consider transporting to your back -up provider (details for this are in your cold chain policy). Download the data logger and check for inconsistencies or temperature fluctuations; note any temperature fluctuations outside the +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C range, a nd the time -period Breeches of less than 30 minutes, under 12\u00b0C with a known cause can be documented but you do not need to report to local immunisation coordinator. If the cause is unknown, or multiple events occur on the same day, seek advice. Contact yo ur local immunisation coordinator for advice and further actions. Document the steps and actions you have taken. 2.1.2 Informed consent What is informed consent? Informed consent is a fundamental concept in the provision of health care services, including immu nisation. It is based on ethical obligations that are supported by legal provisions (eg, the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994, Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights 1996, Health Information Privacy Code 1994, Privacy Act 1993 and Privacy Amendment Act 2013). Providing meaningful information to enable an informed choice and to seek informed consent is a duty that all health and disability providers must meet to uphold the rights of health and disability consumers. Informed cons ent includes the right to be honestly and openly informed about one 's personal health matters. The right to agree to treatment carries with it the right to refuse and withdraw from treatment. 34 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Informed consent is also an external expression of a health care provider 's pivotal ethical duty to uphold and enhance their patient 's autonomy by respecting the patient 's personhood in every aspect of their relationship with that individual. The informed consent process Informed consent is a process whereb y the individual or parent/guardian are appropriately informed in an environment and manner that are meaningful. Having been well informed, they are willing and able to agree to what is being suggested without coercion. Regardless of age, an individual an d/or their parent/guardian must be able to understand: that they have a choice why they are being offered the treatment/procedure what is involved in what they are being offered the probable benets, risks, side -effects, failure rates and alternatives, and the risks and benefits of not receiving the treatment or procedure. To make an informed choice and give informed consent for vaccination, the individual or parent/guardian needs to understand the benefits and risks of vaccination, including those to the child and community. Consent for patients who are incompetent (individuals who do not have the capacity to consent) may be given by: a welfare guardian appointed under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 an attorney under an activated enduring power of attorney in respect of care and welfare . If there is no welfare guardian or attorney under an enduring power of attorney, treatment may be provided under Right 7(4) of the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights if: the treatment is in the best interests of the patient; and attempts have been made to find out what the patient would have wanted if s/he were competent; or if it is not possible to find out what the patient would have wanted, the views of people interested in the patient 's welfare have been considered. The essential elements of the informed consent process are effective communication, full information and freely given competent consent. The specific rights in the Code of Health and Disability Services Consume rs' Rights that represent these three elements are: Right 5: Right to effective communication Right 6: Right to be fully informed Right 7: Right to make an informed choice and give informed consent.1 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 35 For example, section 7(1) of the Code states that 'services may be provided to a consumer only if that consumer makes an informed choice and gives informed consent, except where any enactment, or the common law, or any other provision of the Code provides otherwise. ' Information on the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights can be found on the Health and Disability Commissioner 's website ( www.hdc.org.nz ). Health professionals have legal obligations to obtain informed consent prior to a procedure and prior to data collection (eg, data collected for the NIR). Unless there are specic legal excepti ons to the need for consent, the health professional who acts without consent potentially faces the prospect of a civil claim for exemplary damages, criminal prosecution for assault (sections 190 and 196 of the Crimes Act 1961), complaints to the Health an d Disability Commissioner and professional disciplining. Ensuring that an individual has made an informed choice regarding treatment options has been included in the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003. This Act ensures that health practiti oners are, and remain, competent and safe to practise. For example, the Nursing Council of New Zealand competencies for the Registered Nurse Scope of Practice, Competency 2.4, 'ensures the client has adequate explanation of the effects, consequences and al ternatives of proposed treatment options ' (see the Nursing Council of New Zealand website, www.nursingcouncil.org.nz ). Privacy and control over personal information The right to authorise, or to exert some control over, the collection and disclosure of personal information about oneself is a right closely allied to that of consent to treatment and is also relevant to personal integrity and autonomy. The Health Information Privacy Code 1994 gives people the r ight to access, and seek correction of, health information about them (Rules 6 and 7). It also requires health agencies collecting identifiable information to be open about how and for what purpose that information will be stored, and who will be able to s ee it (Rule 3). Parents and guardians have a similar right of access to information about their children under section 22F of the Health Act 1956. This right is limited in that access requests can be refused if providing the information would be contrary to the interests or wishes of the child. Further information about privacy and health information can be found on the Privacy Commissioner 's website ( www.privacy.org.nz ), or by calling the privacy enquiries line: 0800 803 909. Immunisation consent in primary care Parents should be prepared during the antenatal period for the choice they will have to make about their child 's vaccination. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the lead maternity carer must provide Ministry of Health information on immunisation and the NIR. This is a requirement under clause DA21(c) of the Primary Maternity Services Notice 2007, pursuant to section 88 of the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000. 36 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vaccine hesitancy Vacci ne hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccines. It includes factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence. WHO: Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy (www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/vaccine_hesitancy/en/ ) Effective communication and active listening are key components of the informed consent process, especially when health care providers are working with vaccine - hesitant individuals/parents /guardians. In this situation, providers should: be willing to initiate the conversation, and avoid leaving it to others tailor content to the needs of the individual ensure respect and acknowledgement of concerns use plain language, open -ended questions a nd active listening avoid medical jargon, or ensure it is explained offer resources finish with an effective immunisation recommendation. Information for parents, guardians and health care providers Health care providers must offer information without individuals or parents/guardians having to ask for it. The depth of information offered or required may differ, but it should at least ensure that the individual or parent/guardian understands what the vaccine is for and the possible side -effects, as well as information about the vaccination programme, the NIR and the risks of not being vaccinated (see chapter 3). Every effort should be made to ensure that the need for information is met, including extra discussion time, use of an interpreter and alternative -language pamphlets. Ministry of Health immunisation pamphlets are produced in several languages, and are available from the local authorised provider or can be ordered, viewed and/or downloaded from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ). Issues to discuss with individuals or parents/guardians about immunisation include: the vaccine -preventable diseases the vaccines used on the Schedule (ie, the funded vaccines that are available) how vaccines work, known risks and adverse events, and what the vaccine is made of, in case of known allergies the collection of immuni sation information on the NIR from birth, or as part of a targeted immunisation programme (eg, the information that will be collected, who will have access to it and how it will be used; see section 2.3.5 for more information on the NIR) the choice to vaccinate. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 37 Informed consent is required for each immunisation episode or dose. Presentation for an immunisation event should not be interpreted as implying consent. Ind ividuals and parents/guardians have the right to change their mind at any time. Where consent is obtained formally but not in writing, the provider should document what was discussed, and that consent was obtained and by whom. Ministry of Health informati on Ministry of Health immunisation information is available for parents and guardians on the Ministry of Health 's website ( www.health.govt.nz/immunisation ). Parents and guardians may also order, view o r download Ministry of Health immunisation information from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ) or from the local authorised resource provider, including: Immunise Your Child on Time (leaflet, available in English [HE1327] and other languages) Childhood Immunisation (health education booklet [HE1323]). Further immunisation consent information for health care providers is also available in Appendix 3 'Immunisation standards for vaccinators and guidelines for organisations offering immunisation services '. Responses to commonly asked questions and suggestions for addressing myths and concerns are available in chapter 3.

The parent/guardian may not be with the child on the day of immuni sation, so immunisation should proceed only after the parent/guardian has had the opportunity to read the immunisation information and discuss any areas of concern. Consent forms are provided for immunisations given in schools by public health nurses and m ay also be used in mass vaccination settings. For children aged under 16 years who are being immunised at school, written consent must be obtained from the parent/guardian. Individuals who are aged 16 years or older may self -consent. Consent and children Under the Code of Rights, every consumer, including a child, has the right to the information they need to make an informed choice or to give informed consent. The law relating to the ability of children to consent to medical treatment is complex. There is no defined age at which all children can consent to all health and disability services. The presumption that parental consent is necessary to give health care to those aged under 16 years is inconsistent with common law developments and the Code of Rights . The Code of Rights makes a presumption of competence (to give consent) in relation to children, although New Zealand is unusual in this respect (ie, the obligations regarding consent of minors are greater in New Zealand than in many other jurisdictions) . A child aged under 16 years has the right to give consent for minor treatment, including immunisation, providing he or she understands fully the benets and risks involved. In 2002 the Health and Disability Commissioner provided an opinion of a child 's consent to a vaccine, whereby the Commissioner was satised that a 14 -year- old was competent to give informed consent for an immunisation event due to an injury where a tetanus toxoid vaccine would be commonly given. More details of this opinion can be fou nd on the Health and Disability Commissioner 's website (www.hdc.org.nz - Case: 01HDC02915). Further information on informed consent can be found on the Health and Disability Commissioner 's website ( www.hdc.org.nz ). 2.1.3 Pre-vaccination screening Prior to immunisation with any vaccine, the vaccinator should ascertain if the vaccine recipient (child or adult) has a condition or circumstance which may influence whether a vaccine is given, deferred or contraindicated. Table 2.2 below provides a checklist of conditions or circumstances to screen for, along with the appropriate action to take and a rationale. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 39 The vaccinator will also need to determine which vaccines a re due, assess the vaccine recipient 's overall current vaccination status and address parental concerns. The vaccinator also needs to advise the individual/parent/guardian they will need to remain for 20 minutes post -vaccination. Table 2.2: Pre -vaccination screening and actions to take Condition* or circumstance Action Rationale Is unwell today: fever >38\u00b0C acute systemic illness Defer all vaccines until afebrile. Note: Children with minor illnesses (without acute symptoms/signs) should be vaccinated. To avoid an adverse event in an already unwell child, or to avoid attributing symptoms to vaccination. Is a preterm infant and had apnoea following immunisation in hospital (at 6-week and/or 3 - month event) Re-admission for the next infant immunisation and respiratory monitoring for 48 to 72 hours may be warranted,2 but do not avoid or delay immunisation. Babies born <28 weeks ' gestation and other preterm babies who develop chronic lung disease will require PCV13 plus PPV23 at 2 years (see section 4.2.2). There is a potential risk of apnoe a in infants born before 28 weeks ' gestation. Preterm infants may be at increased risk of vaccine - preventable diseases (eg , invasive pneumococcal disease) . Previously had a severe reaction to any vaccine Careful consideration will be needed depending on the nature of the reaction. If in doubt about the safety of future doses, seek specialist advice. Anaphylaxis to a previous vaccine dose or any component of the vaccine is an absolute contraindication to further vaccination with that vaccine. Anaphylaxis to vaccine components (eg, gelatin, neomycin) Refer to the relevant vaccine data sheet ( www.medsafe.govt.nz ) for the components. If an individual has had anaphylaxis to any component contained in a vaccine, seek specialist advice. Note: Egg allergy, including anaphylactic egg allergy, is not a contraindication to MMR or influenza vaccination (see sections 11.6.3 and 12.6.3 ). Vaccinators need to be aware of the possibility that allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after any vaccination without any apparent ris k factors (see section 2.3.3). Delayed hypersensitivity to a prior vaccine dose or a component of a vaccine is not a contraindication to further doses, but it is imp ortant to distinguish this from anaphylaxis. Appropriate spacing between doses of the same vaccine (when was the last vaccination, and what was it?) See section 2.1.5 and check the relevant disease chapters and catch - up schedules. (See below for live parenteral vaccines.) The general rule is for a minimum of 4 weeks between doses of a primary series and 4 months between the priming dose(s) and the booster. Continued overleaf 40 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Condition* or circumstance Action Rationale Had a live parenteral vaccine within the last 4 weeks - if in doubt, check the individual 's immunisation status on the NIR (if applicable) Delay further live attenuated parenteral vaccines to 4 weeks. Note that this does not apply to rotavirus vaccine, which is an oral vaccine . The antibody response to the first dose may interfere with the response to the second. They may be given on the same day . Had an injection of immunoglobulin or a blood transfusion within the last year and is now due for a live vaccine Check which product the person received and the interval since administration. See Table A6.1 . Delay vaccination if necessary. Live virus vaccines should be given at least 3 weeks before or deferred. The interval will be determined by the blood product and dose received . Has a disease that lowers immunity, is re ceiving treatment that lowers immunity or is an infant of a mother who received immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy See chapter 4 'Immunisation of special gro ups'. In some cases, specialist advice may need to be sought before vaccination. Note: Persons living with someone with lowered immunity should be fully vaccinated, including with live viral vaccines (see section 4.3.1 ). The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine may be suboptimal in persons who are immunocompromised. Live attenuated vaccines may be contraindicated. Is planning a pregnancy See section 4.1.1 'Women planning pregnancy '. Ensure women and household members have received all vaccines recommended for their age group. Women should know if they are immune to measles ( section 22.5.4 ). Advise women not to become pregnant within 4 weeks of receiving live viral vaccines. Vaccinating before pregnancy may prevent ma ternal illness, which could affect the infant, and may confer passive immunity to the newborn. Is pregnant See sections 4.1.2 'During pregnancy ' and 4.1.3 'Breastfeeding and post - partum '. Influenza and Tdap vaccines are recommended. Vaccinating (with inactivated or subunit vaccines) during pregnancy may prevent maternal illness, which could affect the infant, and confers passive immunity to the newborn. Live vaccines should be avoided until after the delivery. Deferring administration of live vaccines until after delivery is a precautionary safety measure. Studies of women who inadvertently received a live vaccine during pregnancy and their infants have not identified any adverse effects. Continued overleaf IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 41 Condition* or circumstance Action Rationale Unstable neurological condition (for pertussis - containing vaccines only) Seek specialist advice. Vaccination is recommended for children with unstable neurological conditions as they may be at high risk of severe pertussis complications. Individual cases should be discussed with a specialist. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders Administer intramuscular vaccines with caution: use a 23 -gauge or smaller needle and apply firm pressure to the injection site (without rubbing) for at least 10 minutes. (see section 2.2.3). A haematoma may occur following intramuscular administration. In some cases, subcutaneous is preferred where datasheet allows. Seek specialist advice as appropriate. Individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpo int inhibitors, as well as those who have discontinued treatment within the past 6 months. Seek specialist advice. There is a theoretical risk that vaccines may trigger an autoimmune response in these individuals. See the 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immu nostimulant) therapy ' discussion in section 4.3.2. History of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) The risks and benefits of withholding vaccination should be considered on an individual basis. Consider the risk of recurrent GBS following influenza infection. * See chapter 4 for more information about pregnancy and lacta tion and for information about infants with special immunisation considerations, immune -deficient and immunosuppressed individuals, immigrants and refugees, travel, and occupational and other risk factors.

Australian Immunisation Handbook Canberra: Australian Government Department URL: https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au (accessed 30 June 2020) . 2.1.4 Contraindications No individual should be denied vaccination without serious consideration of the consequences, both for the individual and for the community. Where there is any doubt, se ek advice from the individual 's general practitioner (GP), a public health medicine specialist, medical ofcer of health, consultant paediatrician or IMAC. 42 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Anaphylaxis to a previous vaccine dose or any component of the vaccine is an absolute contraindication to further vaccination with that vaccine. (Note that egg - related anaphylaxis and influenza vaccine or MMR are exceptions.) For more detail on anaphylaxis, see section 2.3.3 . Live viral vaccines should not be given to pregnant women, nor, in general, to immunosuppressed individuals (see chapter 4). Seek specialist advice for individuals being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have discontinued treatment within the past 6 months. See section 4.3.2 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy '. See the relevant disease chapter section for more specific vaccine contraindications. Conditions that are not contraindications to im munisation The conditions in Table 2.3 are not contraindications to the immunisation of children and adults (see also section 3.1). Table 2.3: Conditions that are not contraindications to immunisation Individuals with these conditions should be vaccinated with all the recommended vaccines. Mildly unwell, with a temperature 38\u00b0C Asthma, hay fever, eczema, 'snuffles ', allergy to house dust Receiving treatment with antibiotics or locally acting steroids A breastfeeding mother or a breastfed child Neonatal jaundice Low weight in an otherwise healthy child The child being over the usual age for immunisation - use age -appropriate vaccines, as per the catch -up schedules in Appendix 2 (the exception is rotavirus vaccine: see section 18.5.2 ) A previous hypotonic -hyporesponsive (see section 2.3.3) Clinical history of pertussis, measles, mumps or rubella infection - clinical history without laboratory conrmation cannot be taken as proof of immunity (even when an individual is proven to be immune to one or two of either measles, mumps or rubella, there is still the need for immunisation against the other/s: see relevant chapters) Prematurity, but an otherwise well infant - it is particularly important to immunise these children, who ar e at higher risk of severe illness if infected; immunisation is recommended at the usual chronological age (see 'Preterm and low birthweight infants ' in section 4.2.2) Stable neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy or Down syndrome Contact with an infectious disease Egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, is not a contraindication to MMR (see section 12.6.3 ) or influenza vaccine (see section 11.6.3 ) Family history of vaccine reactions Family history of seizures Family history of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) Child 's mother or household me mber is pregnant or immunocompromised IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 43 2.1.5 Spacing of doses In general, follow the recommendations in the manufacturers ' data sheets. Principles for spacing of doses of the same vaccine The immune response to a series of vaccines depends on the time interval between doses. The general rule is for a minimum of four weeks between doses of a primary series; however, the immune response may be better with longer intervals. A repeat dose of the same vaccine given less than four weeks after the previous dos e may result in a reduced immune response. Specific recommendations for a rapid schedule by the manufacturer may apply for some vaccines. Generally, a minimum interval of four to six months between priming dose(s) and the booster dose allows affinity matu ration of memory B cells, and thus higher secondary responses (see section 1.1). It is not necessary to repeat a prior dose if the time elapsed between doses is mor e than the recommended interval. Spacing of different vaccines Two or more parenterally administered live vaccines may be given at the same visit; for example, MMR and VV. However, when given at different visits, a minimum interval of four weeks is recomm ended. This interval is to avoid the response to the second vaccine being diminished due to interference from the response to the first vaccine. Note that no interval is required between administration of Bacillus Calmette - Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and rotavirus vacci nes. Unless there is a specic recommendation against it, a subunit vaccine can be administered either simultaneously or at any time before or after a different subunit or live vaccine. Concurrent administration of vaccines Changing the timing of visits or increasing the number of visits to avoid multiple injections delays protection against potentially serious diseases and may also lead to incomplete immunisation. Best practice is to follow the Schedule. Where different injectable vaccines are gi ven on the same day, they must be administered in separate syringes, at different sites. 44 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 2.1.6 Catch -up programmes for unimmunised or partially immunised children The objective of a catch -up programme is to complete a course of vaccinations that provides adequa te protection. Catch -up programmes should be based on documented evidence of previous vaccination (eg, the child 's Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book , NIR or overseas immunisation records). When children have missed vaccine doses, it is important to bring them up to date as quickly as possible. Where more than one vaccine is overdue, it is preferable to give as many as possible at the first visit. For children aged 12 months and older, MMR is the priority. See Appen dix 2 for determining catch -up requirements and planning a catch -up programme. If the vaccinator is uncertain about how to plan a catch -up programme, they should contact the local immun isation coordinator, IMAC, medical ofcer of health or public health service. Once catch -up is achieved, vaccination for the child should continue as per the Schedule. Vaccination of children with inadequate vaccination records It is recommended that chi ldren without a documented history of vaccination have a full course of vaccinations appropriate for their age. It is preferable, and safe, for the individual to receive an unnecessary dose rather than to miss out a required dose(s) and not be fully protec ted. 2.1.7 Adult vaccination (aged 18 years and older) Whenever adults are seen in general practice or by immunisation providers, there is an opportunity to ensure they have been adequately protected against the following diseases and have received at least a p rimary immunisation course as described in Table 2.4. If the requisite number of doses has not been received, catch -up vaccination is recommended and funded (see Appendix 2 ). Women of childbearing age should know whether or not they are immune to measles (see chapter 12), rubella (see chapter 19) and varicella (see chapter 22). Refer to the PHARMAC schedule for further details on vaccines funde d for adults (available at www.pharmac.govt.nz ).

Although pertussis protection is included in the Tdap vaccine as part of protection against Tetanus and diphtheria, if a patient is missing this antigen only but is otherwise fully vaccinated, no further vaccines are required unless the patient is pregnant . b. Individuals who were under age 27 years when they commenced HPV vacc ination are currently funded to complete the 3 -dose course, even if they are older than 27 years when they complete it.

On the advice of their specialist. 2.2 Vaccine administration 2.2.1 Minimising pain and distress at the time of vaccination The WHO key recommendations for minimising pain and distress at the time of vaccination are:3, 4 do not aspirate (draw back) when giving vaccines administer vaccines from the least to the most painful for a ll ages breastfeed before and during vaccine injection position (hold the infant/young child, individuals aged 3 years and older should sit up, parental presence) for infants, give oral rotavirus vaccine before injections (the vaccine contains sucrose that can reduce pain) use calming and supportive words at the time of vaccination; avoid language that increases anxiety provide appropriate distractions consider using topical anaesthetics (only if the cost is acceptable to the family). See also section 2.3.2 and the IMAC factsheet Mitigating Vaccination Pain -resources ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 49 2.2.2 Preparing for vaccine administration Key points for administering injectable vaccines Vaccines should not be mixed in the same syringe, unless the prescribing information sheet specically states it is permitted or essential (eg, DTaP -IPV- HepB/Hib). Careful use of a longer needle will cause less damage than a short needle. To avoid tracking, make sure all the vaccine has been injected before smoothly withdrawing the needle. Correct vaccine administration is importan t, and vaccinators have a responsibility to see that vaccines are given: in the optimal site as recommended in Handbook using the appropriate needle size for vaccine effectiveness and patient safety. The use of alternative sites will be based on professional judgement, including knowledge of the potential risks at each site and recommendations in the manufacturer 's data sheet. The guidelines in Table 2.6 will help to make the experience less distressing for the individual, parent/guardian and/or whnau, and vaccinator. 50 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 2.6: Guidelines for vaccine administration Preparation Immunisation even t Vaccinate in a private and appropriate setting. Draw up injections out of sight, if possible. Medical equipment is commonplace to vaccinators, but it may heighten the anxiety of some individuals. Prepare the area/room layout to suit the vaccinator and vaccination event. Ensure the individual or parent/guardian has had the opportunity to discuss any concerns and has given informed consent. Be familiar with the vaccines (eg, their correct preparation, administration and the potential for adverse events). Be prepared to include other family members and whnau in the discussion; explain to older children accompanying infants why the injections are being given and what will happen. Be aware of the individual 's immunisation hist ory (eg, submit an NIR status query if the history is unknown). Give the appropriate immunisations due and advise when the next immunisation event is due. Ensure there are age -appropriate distractions available. For breastfed babies, suggest that the moth er breastfeeds baby before, during and after immunisation. For children, sit them upright and talk quietly to them before and during immunisation. Make eye contact and explain what is going to happen. Even when a child is unable to understand the words, an unhurried, quiet approach has a calming effect and reassures the parent/guardian. See also section 2.3.2. Ensure the relevant immunisation health education resources are available. Give written and verbal advice to the individual and parent/guardian. The advice should cover what may be expected after immunisation, and what to do in the event of an adverse event, along with advice on when to notify the vaccinator. Removal of air bubbles Advice for removal of air in the syringe before vaccine administration is dependent on the vaccine pr esentation. For guidelines see Table 2.7. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 51 Table 2.7: Guidelines for management of air bubbles in a vaccine syringe Vaccine presentation Management of air bubbles Vaccines supplied in a prefilled syringe with a fixed needle Do not expel the air Vaccines supplied in a prefilled syringe without a fixed needle (eg, Gardasil 9) Add an appropriate administration needle Do not expel the air Vaccines supplied diluted in a vial Draw up the entire vaccine volume into a syringe Expel the air until the vaccine is at the level of the syringe hub, then change the needle Do not expel the air contained in the new needle Vaccines supplied as diluent and powder/pellet requiring reconstitution Reconstitute the vaccine correctly Draw up the entire vaccine volume into a syringe Expel the air until the vaccine is at the level of the syringe hub, then change the needle Do not expel the air contained in the new needle Skin preparation Skin preparation or cleansing when the injection site is clean is not necessary. However, if an alcohol swab is used, it must be allowed to dry for at least two minu tes, otherwise alcohol may be tracked into the muscle, causing local irritation. Alcohol may also inactivate a live attenuated vaccine such as MMR. A dirty injection site may be washed with soap and water and thoroughly dried before the immunisation event . Special considerations for COVID -19 outbreak At the time of writing, while there is an ongoing risk of COVID -19, patients should be screened before vaccination to exclude those who are at risk of having or having had contact with a COVID -19 case in past 14 days. Patients who have tested positive for COVID -19 (or SARS -CoV2 virus) should self - isolate and not attend for vaccination until they are at least 14 days post -test and symptom free. 2.2.3 Route of administration Most Schedule vaccines are administer ed by intramuscular injection. The exceptions are IPV (IPOL; subcutaneously), BCG (intradermally) and rotavirus (oral). Live vaccines have previously been given via SC route and data sheets may still show this as an option, which can be helpful for those w ith bleeding disorders (see below). 52 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Needle angle, gauge and length Intramuscular injections should be administered at a 90 -degree angle to the skin plane. The needle length used will be determined by the size of the limb and muscle bulk, whether the tissu e is bunched or stretched and the vaccinator 's professional judgement. BCG vaccine (which can only be administered by authorised vaccinators with BCG endorsement) is given by intradermal injection . See Table 2.8.

Continued overleaf IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 53 Age Site Needle gauge and length Rationale Intradermal injection: BCG vaccine - for authorised vaccinators with BCG Intradermal injection Slightly above the insertion of the deltoid muscle on the lateral surface of the left arm. The arm should be gently but firmly supported. Drawing -up: Tuberculin syringe (attach a drawing -up needle), or a single -use insulin syringe with a needle attached Administering: If using a tuberculin syringe, change the needle to a sterile 26 G \u00d7 13 or 16 mm needle (no needle change required if using an insulin syringe) The syringe should be held with the bevel uppermost, parallel with the skin of the arm. The bevel should be fully inserted but visible under the skin. Inject the vaccine slowly and gradually to form a white 'bleb' or wheal, then gradually withdraw the needle. a. Consideration may be given to the vastus lateralis as an alternative vaccination site, providing it is not contraindicated by the manufacturer 's data sheet. Intramuscular injection sites Injectable vaccines should be administered in healthy, well -developed muscle, in a site as free as possible from the risk of local, neura l, vascular and tissue injury. Incorrectly administered vaccines (incorrect sites and poor administration techniques) contribute to vaccine failure, injection -site nodules or sterile abscesses, and increased local reactions. Careful use of a longer needle will cause less damage than a shorter needle. The recommended sites for intramuscular (IM) vaccines (based on proven uptake and safety data) are: the vastus lateralis muscle on the anterolateral thigh for infants aged under 12 months - the vastus lateral is muscle is large, thick and well developed in infants, wrapping slightly onto the anterior thigh either the vastus lateralis or deltoid site for children aged 12 months to 3 years (see below) the d eltoid muscle for older children, adolescents and adults. The deltoid muscle is not routinely used in infants and young children aged under 12 months, due to the potential for deltoid or radial nerve injury. However, when there is no access to the vastus lateralis (eg, the infant is in a spica cast), the deltoid muscle is used to administer intramuscular vaccines. The buttock should not be used for the administration of vaccines in infants or young children, because the buttock region is mostly subcutaneous fat until the child has been walking for at leas t 9 to 12 months. Use of the buttock is not recommended for adult vaccinations either, because the buttock subcutaneous layer can vary from 1 to 9 cm and IM deposition may not occur. 54 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 With older children and adults, consideration may be given to using the v astus lateralis as an alternative site to the deltoid. Subcutaneous injection sites A subcutaneous (SC) injection should be given into healthy tissue that is away from bony prominences and free of large blood vessels or nerves. The recommended site for subcutaneous vaccine administration is the upper arm (overlying the deltoid muscle). The principles for locating the upper arm site for an SC injection are the same as for an IM injection. However, needle length is more critical than angle of insertion for subcutaneous injections. An insertion angle of 45 degrees is recommended, and the needle should never be longer than 16 mm, or inadvertent IM administration could result. The thigh may be used for SC vaccination unless contraindicated by the manufacturer 's data sheet. For patients with thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders, the risk of haematoma may be reduced when given via SC route. See below for further details. Intramuscular versus subcutaneous administration The Ministry of Health recommends that pa renteral live vaccines on the Schedule (MMR, varicella and zoster vaccines) be administered via intramuscular (IM) route, unless the patient is on an anticoagulant or has a bleeding disorder, in which case the preferred route is subcutaneous (SC) where the data sheet allows (see below). Historically, live vaccines have been given subcutaneously following on from their original licensure trials. Further research has now established immunogenicity and safety when these vaccines are administered by the IM rout e.7 There is evidence that injections given intramuscularly, rather than deep subcutaneously, are less likely to cause local reactions.8, 9, 10 There are no immunogenicity concerns when MMR, varicella and zoster vaccines are given either SC or IM. BCG is required to be given intradermally. Thrombocytopenia, anticoagulant therapy a nd bleeding disorders For patients with thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders, the risk of haematoma may be reduced when given via SC route, where data sheet allows this option . Vaccines can be administered to people on anticoagulants, route is preferred option where data allows, to reduce risk of haematoma. For vaccines that do not have the SC option administer IM. After vaccination, apply firm pressure over the injection site without rubbing for 10 minutes to reduce the risk of bruising. For patients with haemophilia receiving clotting factor replacement or a similar therapy, vaccinations should be given as soon as possible after receiving the medicine a nd vaccines should be given in the same way as for those on anticoagulants. Specialist advice is recommended. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 55 Intradermal injections The intradermal injection technique for BCG vaccine (see section 2.2.4) requires special training, and should only be performed by an authorised vaccinator with BCG endorsement (see Appendix 4 ). Oral vaccine administration The rotavirus vaccine is administered orally. Administer the entire contents of the oral applicator into the infant 's mouth, towards the inner cheek (see section A7.2.4 ). Do not inject oral vaccines. For specific oral vaccine administration instructions, refer to the vaccine data sheet (available on the Medsafe website: www.medsafe.govt.nz ). 2.2.4 Infant vaccination Infants aged under 6 months do not need to be grasped or restrained as rmly as toddlers or older children. At this age, excessive restraint increases their fear as well as muscle tautness. The recommended positioning for an infant is in a cuddle hold with parent/guardian, breastfeeding as appropriate . The cuddle position offers better psychological support and comfort for both the infant and the parent/guardian,3 and the parent/guardian should be offered this position as a first choice ( Figure 2.1). If the parent/guardian is helping to hold the infant or child, ensure they un derstand what is expected of them and what will take place. Most vaccinators choose to quickly administer all the injections due and soothe the infant or child afterwards (see section 2.3.2 for soothing measures). Figure 2.1: The cuddle position for infants 56 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vastus lateralis To locate the injection site, undo the nappy, gently adduct the flexed knee and (see Figure 2.2): 1. nd the greater trochanter 2. nd the lateral femoral condyle 3. section the thigh into thirds and run an imaginary line between the centres of the two markers (look for the dimple along the lower portion of the fascia lata). The injection site is at the junction of the upper and middle thirds and slightly anterior to (above) the imaginary line, in the bulkiest part of the muscle. Figure 2.2: The infant lateral thigh injection site The needle should be directed at a 90 -degree angle to the skin surface and inserted at the junction of the upper and middle thirds. Inject the vaccine at a controlled rate. To avoid tracking, make sure all the vaccine has been injected before smoothly withdrawing the needle. Do not massage or rub the injection site afterwards. However, infants with a bleeding disorder may require firm pressure over the injection site without rubbing for at least 10 minutes. BCG vaccine (administered by authorised vaccinato rs with BCG endorsement) The reconstituted BCG vaccine is given by intradermal injection slightly above the insertion of the deltoid muscle on the lateral surface of the left arm. The infant 's arm should be gently but firmly supported (see Figure 2.3(a)). The syringe should be held with the needle bevel uppermost, parallel with the skin of the arm (see Figure 2.3(b)). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 57 Figure 2.3: The infant BCG vaccination site, and how to support the infant 's arm and hold the syringe (a) (b) Inject the vaccine slowly (see Figure 2.4(a)), then gradually withdraw the needle. The injection is given slowly to avoid leakage around the needle or vaccine being squirted. Safety glasses should be used to protect the eyes of those involved. If BCG vaccine is accidentally squirted into the eyes, wash them immediately with water. Following BCG vaccination a white weal should appear (see Figure 2.4(b)), which should subside in approximately 30 minutes. The vaccination site requires no swabbing or dressing. Figure 2.4: The BCG vaccine being slowly injected, and a white weal appearing as the needle is gradually withdrawn (a) (b) 58 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 2.2.5 Young child vaccination (vastus lateralis or deltoid) The choice between the two sites for IM injections from 12 months of age will be based on the vaccinator 's professional judgement, taking in account knowledge of the child and ease of restraint. Some vaccinators consider the vastus lateralis preferable for young children when the deltoid muscle bulk is small and because of the superciality of the radial nerv e. Discuss the options with the parent/guardian when making your decision. (See also 'The 12 - and 15 -month immunisation events ' in section 2.2.7.) The easiest and safest way to position and restrain a young child for a lateral thigh and/or deltoid injection is to sit the child sideways on their parent 's or guardian 's lap. The parent 's/guardian 's hand restrains the child 's outer arm and the child 's legs a re either restrained between the parent 's/guardian 's legs or by placing a hand on the child 's outer knee or lower leg. Alternatively, the child may face their parent/guardian while straddling the parent 's/guardian 's legs (see Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.6). Figure 2.5: Cuddle positions for vastus lateralis or deltoid injections in children (a) (b) Figure 2.6: The straddle position for vastus lateralis or deltoid injections in children In the straddle position, both the deltoid and vastus lateralis muscle are likely to be more tense or taut, and the injection may therefore be more painful. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 59 2.2.6 Older child, adolescent and adult vaccination (deltoid) The deltoid muscle is located in the lateral aspect of the upper arm. The entire deltoid muscle must be exposed to avoid the risk of radial nerve injury (an injection at the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the lateral aspect of the upper arm may damage the nerve) (see Figure 2.7). Figure 2.7: Surface landmarks and structures potentially damaged by intramuscular injection in the upper limb Reproduced with permission: Cook IF. 2011. An evidence -based protocol for the prevention of upper arm injury related to vaccine administration (UAIRVA). Human Vaccines 7(8): 845 -8. The volume injected into the deltoid should not exceed 0.5 mL in children and 1.0 mL in adults. The v accine recipient should be seated with their arm removed from the garment sleeve and hanging relaxed at their side. The vaccinator places their index finger on the vaccine recipient 's acromion process (the highest point on the shoulder) and their thumb on the vaccine recipient 's deltoid tuberosity (the lower deltoid attachment point).11 The injection site is at the axilla line, between these anatomical landmarks. The vaccine should be deposited at the bulkiest part of the muscle ( Figure 2.8). Figure 2.8: How to locate the deltoid site 60 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 2.2.7 Multiple injections at the same visit A well -prepared and condent vaccinator will reassure the parent/guardian or whnau that giving concurrent vaccines is a safe and appropriate practice, avoiding multiple visits. When more than one vaccine is scheduled at the same visit, it is recommended that vaccinators give all the scheduled vaccines at that visit. This particularly applies to the 15-month event (see below), when three vaccines are scheduled. Multiple vaccines should not be mixed in a single syringe unless specically licensed and labelled for administration in one syringe. A different needle and syringe should be used for each injection. The 12 -month and 15 -month immunisation events MMR1 and PCV are the vaccines are scheduled at the 12 -month immunisation event. It is preferable to give these injections in the vastus lateralis. Should parents request extra non -funded vaccines, such as 4CMenB (Bexsero), MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) or extra dose of VV. These vaccines can be given in the deltoid. To give two injections in the same limb, the vastus lateralis is preferred because of its grea ter muscle mass (see Figure 2.9). The injection sites should be on the long axis of the thigh and separated by at least 2 cm so that potential localised reactions will not overlap. MMR2, varicella and Hib -PRP-T vaccines are scheduled at the 15 -month event. When giving these vaccines, it is preferable to give one in each vastus lateralis and the third in the deltoid. The recommended vaccine administration sequence and l ocation is: 1. Hib-PRP-T: IM in left leg (vastus lateralis) 2. Varicella: IM in left arm (deltoid) 3. MMR: IM in right leg (vastus lateralis). If parents/guardians request to split the vaccines given at the 15 -month event, then providers are advised to give MMR and VV at the first visit, followed by Hib -PRP-T at the second visit. Note : there is a risk that the patient may not return for the second visit when the 15-month vaccines are split. If MMR and VV are not given at the same visit (concurrently), then ther e should be an interval of at least four weeks between them. This interval is to avoid the response to the second vaccine being diminished due to interference from the response to the first vaccine (see section 2.1.5). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 61 Multiple injections in the same muscle When two injections are to be given in the same limb, the vastus lateralis is preferred because of its greater muscle mass (see Figure 2.9). The injection sites should be on the long axis of the thigh and separated by at least 2 cm so that localised reactions will not overlap. If multiple injections in the deltoid are required, the sites should be separated by at least 2 cm.12 Figure 2.9: Suggested sites for multiple injections in the lateral thigh 2.3 Post-vaccination 2.3.1 Post-vaccination advice Post-vaccination advice should be given both verbally and in writing. The advice should cover: which vaccines have been given and the injection sites, and whether the injections were IM or SC potential vaccine responses following immunisation (see Table 2.9) and what to do if these occur (eg, measures for relieving fever, when to seek medical advice) when the individual or parent/guardian should contact the vaccinator if they are worried or concerned contact p hone numbers (including after -hours phone numbers). 62 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 2.9: Potential vaccine responses Vaccine Potential vaccine responses DTaP - or Tdap -containing vaccine Localised pain, redness and swelling at inject ion site Mild fever Being grizzly and unsettled Loss of appetite, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea Drowsiness Extensive limb swelling after multiple doses of a DTaP -containing vaccine Hib-PRP Localised pain, redness and swelling at the injection site Mild fever Being grizzly and unsettled Hepatitis B Very occasionally pain and redness at the injection site Nausea or diarrhoea HPV Fainting, especially in adolescents - this is an injection reaction, not a reaction to the vaccine Localised discomfort, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site Mild fever Headache Influenza Localised pain, redness and swelling at injection site Headache Fever MMR Measles component: Fever which lasts 1 -2 days; days after immun isation Mumps Rubella component: Mild rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, joint pain 1-3 weeks after immunisation Pneumococcal Localised pain, redness and swelling at injection site Mild fever Irritability, sleep changes Loss of appetite Rotavirus Diarrhoea and or vomiting may occur after the first dose Mild abdominal pain Varicella Localised pain, redness and swelling at injection site Mild fever Mild rash, possibly at the injection site (2 -5 lesions, appearing 5 -26 days after immunisation) IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 63 2.3.2 Recommendations for fever and pain management The use of paracetamol (or ibuprofen) around the time of immunisation in anticipation of immunisation -related fever or localised pain occurring is not generally recommended. However, use of these medicines is recommended if the child is distressed due to discomfort following immunisation. Antipyretic use may lower the immune response to some vaccines.13 Although, there is no evidence that this results in less protection against disease. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss with parents the possible immunisation responses and non -pharmaceutical management of fever or pain, as well as the role of medicines. Fever General fever -relieving measures include: giving extra fluids to drink (eg, more breastfeeds or water) reducing clothing if the baby is hot. While a high fever alone does not need treatment, analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) may b e used for distress or pain in a febrile child. It is recommended that infants and children under two years receiving 4CMenB (Bexsero) meningococcal vaccine be given three doses of paracetamol (or ibuprofen) prophylactically to reduce fever (see section 13.4.4 ). Pain management and soothing measures For breastfeeding infants, breastfeeding before, during and after the injection can provide comfort and pain relief.3, 14 Give the rotavirus vaccine 1 -2 minutes before other immunisations; rotavirus vaccines contain sucrose that has been shown to reduce pain.3, 14 The infant can then be breastfed (where possible) or held comfortably while the other immunisations are given. For infants aged under 6 months, the 5 Ss (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking ) have been found to be effective for soothing and reducing pain after immunisations.15 Using age -appropriate distraction has been shown to reduce pain and distress.3, 14 Examples include showing an interesting or musical toy to an infant, or encouraging an older child to blow using a windmill toy or bubbles. Electronic games/phone games can be useful for older children and teenagers. Do not rub the i njection site after the injection, as it increases the risk of vaccine reactogenicity. 64 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 For infants and children, the use of a topical anaesthetic cream or patch has been found to be effective for immunisation pain management.3, 14 Parents/guardians and those administering the vaccine should check the manufacturers ' recommendations before using topical anaesthetics. The correct dose for infants needs to be followed particularly carefully due to risk of methaemoglobinaemia. Topical anaesthetics may have a role in managing immunisation pain and anxiety, particularly f or children who have had previous multiple medical interventions or needle phobias. Following immunisation, if an infant or child is distressed by pain or swelling at the injection site, placing a cold, wet cloth on the area may help relieve the discomfort. Antipyretic analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) may be used if the above measure does not relieve the child 's distress. 2.3.3 Anaphylaxis and emergency management All vaccinators must be able to distinguish anaphylaxis from fainting, anxiety, immu nisation stress -related responses (ISRR), breath -holding spells and seizures. Anaphylaxis is a very rare,16 unexpected and potentially fatal allergic reaction. It develops over several minutes and usually involves multiple body systems. Unconsciousness is rarely the sole manifestation and only occurs as a late event in severe cases. A strong central pulse (eg, carotid) is maintained during a faint (vasovagal syncope), but not in anaphylaxis. In general, the more severe the reaction, the more rapid the onset. Most life - threatening adverse events begin within 10 minutes of vaccination. The intensity usually peaks at around one hour after onset. Symptoms limited to only one system can occur, leading to delay in diagnosis. Biphasic reactions, where symptoms recur 8 to 12 hours after onset of the original attack, and prolonged attacks lasting up to 48 hours have been described. All patients with anaphylaxis should be hospitalised. Signs of anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a severe adverse event of rapid onset, characterised by circulatory collapse. In its less severe (and more common) form, the early signs are generalised erythema and urticaria with upper and/or lower respiratory tract obstruction. In more severe cases, limpness, pallor, loss of consciousness and hypotension become evident, in addition to the early signs. Vaccinators should be able to recognise all the sign s and symptoms of anaphylaxis given in Table 2.10. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 65 Table 2.10: Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis Signs and symptoms Severity Early warning signs (usually within a few minutes) Dizziness, perineal burning, warmth, pruritus, flushing, urticaria, nasal , vomiting, substernal pressure Moderate to severe Life-threatening symptoms (usually from soon after the injection to within 20 minutes after) Bronchospasm, stridor, collapse, hypotension, dysrhythmias Severe There is no place for conservative management of anaphylaxis. Early administration of adrenaline is essential (for more details, see Table 2.12). Misdiagnosis of faints and other common causes of collapse as anaphylaxis may lead to inappropriate use of adrenaline. Misdiagnosis as a faint could also lead to a delay in the administrati on of adrenaline. Vaccinators should therefore be able to distinguish anaphylaxis from fainting (vasovagal syncope), anxiety and breath -holding spells (see Table 2.11). Infants and babies rarely faint. Sudden loss of consciousness, limpness, pallor and vomiting (signs of severe anaphylaxis in children) should be presumed to be an anaphylactic reaction. In adults and older children, the most common adverse event is a sy ncopal episode (fainting), either immediately or soon after vaccination. During fainting the individual suddenly becomes pale, loses consciousness and if sitting or standing will slump to the ground. Recovery of consciousness occurs within a minute or two. Fainting is sometimes accompanied by brief clonic seizure activity, but this generally requires no specic treatment or investigation if it is a single isolated event. Immunisation stress -related response Immunisation stress -related responses (ISRR) is a term used to cover a spectrum of responses to stress generated by immunisations.17 These responses vary from fainting and hyperventilation thr ough to dissociative neurological symptoms, which include non-epileptic seizures. They usually occur in individuals but have also been identified in clusters; this is often referred to as mass psychogenic illness. These stress responses are complex and inv olve both physiological and psychological factors. For more information see the WHO manual synopsis, available from www.who.int/vaccine_safety/en/ . 66 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table Distinguishing anaphylaxis from a faint (vasovagal reaction) Faint Anaphylaxis Onset Usually before, at the time, or soon after the injection Soon after the injection, but there may be a delay of up to 30 minutes System Skin Pale, sweaty, cold and clammy Red, raised and itchy rash; swollen eyes and face; generalised rash Respiratory Normal to deep breaths Noisy breathing due to airways obstruction (wheeze or stridor); respiratory arrest Cardiovascular dysrhythmias; circulatory arrest Gastrointestinal Nausea/vomiting Abdominal cramps Neurological Transient loss of consciousness; good response once supine/flat Loss of consciousness; little response once supine/flat Distinguishing a hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode from anaphylaxis A hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode is a shock -like state defined by the sudden onset of limpness (muscle hypotonia) and decreased responsiv eness, with pallor or cyanosis in infants and children aged under 2 years after immunisation. A hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode can occur from 1 hour to 48 hours after immunisation, typically lasts less than 30 minutes, and resolves spontaneously.18 A hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode is a recognised serious reaction to immunisation and should be reported to CARM (see section 1.6.3). Avoidance of anaphylaxis Before immunisation: ensure there are no known contraindications to immunisation if in doubt about administering the vaccine, consult the individual 's GP or a paedi atrician. Individuals should remain under observation for 20 minutes following vaccination in case they experience an immediate adverse event requiring treatment. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 67 Emergency equipment Vaccinators, providers and quality managers are responsible for: ensuri ng emergency procedures are known by all staff practising emergency procedures regularly having an emergency kit (see Table 2.12) and adrenaline in every room where vaccinations/medications are given checking emergency kits regularly not giving vaccines when working alone. Remember, events happen without warning. Appropriate emergency equipment must be immediately at hand whenever immunisations are given, and all vacci nators must be familiar with the practical steps necessary to save lives following an anaphylactic reaction (see Table 2.12 and Table 2.13). Table 2.12: Emergency equipment An emergency kit should contain: adrenaline* 1:1,000 (at least 3 ampoules) and dosage chart syringes: 1.0 mL (a minimum of 3; tuberculin not insulin, as the insulin needle is too short for IM injection) needles: a range of needle lengths and gauges, including 23 or 25 G \u00d7 25 mm, 22 G \u00d7 38 mm Auto -injectors for self -administration of adrenaline should not be used as a substitute for a proper anaphylaxis pack. However, if an adrenaline auto -injector is the only available adrenaline preparation when treating anaphylaxis, health care providers should use it . Other emergency equipment required It is also necessary to hav e on hand: adult and paediatric bag valve mask resuscitator (eg, Ambu bag) access to a telephone. * The expiry date of the adrenaline and other medicines should be written on the outside of the emergency kit, and the kit should be checked every 4 weeks. Adrenaline is heat and light sensitive and should be stored appropriately. Adrenaline that has a brown tinge must be discarded. The emergency kit may need to have additional equipment for non -clinical settings (see Appendix 4 ). Hydrocortisone injection is used only under the direction of a medical practitioner (see the Practitioner 's Supply Order, list available at www.pharmac.govt.nz/wwwtrs/psolist.php ). Emergency management An IM injection of 1:1,000 adrenaline is the mainstay of the treatment of anaphylaxis, and adrenaline should be universally available when vaccinating. A tuberculin syringe should be used to ensure the accuracy of measurement when drawing up small doses. 68 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 In an emergency, there is no absolute contraindication to the use of adrenaline. It is, however, a very potent agent, and if used when anaphylaxis has not occurred or in excessive doses, adrenaline can cause dysrhythmias, severe hypertension and left ventricular failure. Tissue necrosis can occur if the same injection site is used repeatedly. Intravenous adrenaline should be administered by a medical practitioner with extrem e caution, in small boluses and under careful monitoring, and it is not appropriate as the rst line of treatment of anaphylaxis. Table 2.13: Initial anaphylaxis response/management CALL FOR HELP - send for professional assistance (ambulance, doctor). Never leave the individual alone. ASSESS FOR ANAPHYLAXIS (see Table 2.10 for full details) Airway and breathing Noisy breathing due to airways obstruction; or respiratory arrest Circulation/shock Tachycardia; hypotension; dysrhythmias; circulatory arrest Skin changes Red, raised and itchy rash; swollen eyes and face; generalised rash If cardiac arrest - commence age appropriate CPR and life support measures LAY THE PATIENT DOWN (do not allow them to stand) If they have breathing difficulties, elevate the head and chest. ADMINISTER ADRENALINE by deep IM injection into outer thigh Adrenaline dosage for 1:1,000 formulation is 0.01 mL/kg up to a maximum of 0.5 ml. For those under 10 kg or if weight is not known, use the following guidelines: Age Dose under 2 years 0.1 mL 2-4 years 0.2 mL 5-11 years 0.3 mL 12 years and over 0.5 mL Adult 0.5 mL You can expect to see some response to the adrenaline within 1 -2 minutes. If necessary, adrenaline can be repeated at 5 -15-minute intervals, while waiting for assistance. ADMINISTER OXYGEN , if available, at high flow rates when there is respiratory distress, stridor or wheeze. IF HYPOTENSIVE, ELEVATE LEGS. RECORD VITAL SIGNS every 5 -10 minutes. All observations and interventions need to be clearly documented in medical notes and should accompany the individual to hospital. ADMIT TO HOSPITAL - all cases of anaphylaxis should be admitted to hospital for observation. Rebound anaphylaxis can occur 12 -24 hours after the initial episode. Note: Only medical practitioners should administer IV adrenaline. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 69 In the unlikely event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest following anaphylaxis, assess respiration without putting your face close to the patient 's face, don PPE as soon as it is available and ventil ate via a bag valve mask. Ongoing management in hospital or by a medical practitioner Individuals who experience vaccine -related anaphylaxis should be admitted to hospital. If the individual is in an unstable or deteriorating condition, and is not being transported by ambulance, they must be accompanied by the attending health professional so that treatment can be continued during transfer. Hydrocortisone may be used as adjunctive medication. Nebulised salbutamol is helpful for bronchospasm. For further i nformation, refer to the product data sheet. Additional drugs that may be administered under the direction of a medical practitioner include: nebulised adrenaline: for laryngeal corticosteroids: prednisone 2 mg/kg (up to 40 mg) orally, or hydrocortisone 4 mg/kg IV, to help resolve tissue swelling (prednisolone syrup may be more appropriate for young children and infants). Observation for a period of up to 24 hours after stabil isation of the individual 's condition is recommended due to the risk of late deterioration from delayed and biphasic reactions. All anaphylaxis reactions should be reported to CARM (see section 1.6.3). 2.3.4 Documentation and insurance Accurate documentation, including information on the National Immunisation Register (NIR), School -Based Vaccination System (SBVS) and practice management system (PMS), is essential. If the vaccinator has not kept accurate clinical records, it is difcult to prove what action/care was or was not taken/delivered if the patient notes are subject to legal scrutiny. In addition to the information recorded on the NIR ( see section 2.3.5), SBVS or PMS, information that should be collected in the patient 's clinical notes includes: conrmation that informed consent was given confirma tion that the individual was observed for the recommended time and no adverse events occurred during the observation period (if an adverse event does occur, it is essential to document the action and treatment given and inform CARM - see section 1.6.3). 70 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 The vaccinator should also complete the relevant sections in the Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book and, where applicable, the child 's immunisation certicate (see Appendix 5 ), the Ministry of Health payment claim form (where applicable), and an NIR notification form if the vaccinator is not using a computerised PMS. Indemnity insurance All vaccinators should carry indemnity insurance. Most employers have indemni ty cover, but vaccinators do not have an automatic right to claim under that cover. Indemnity insurance should cover vaccinators/health professionals for disciplinary proceedings, coroners ' inquiries, and claims of negligence or error that may lead to injury, death or damage. 2.3.5 The National Immunisation Register The NIR is a computerised information system that has been collecting immunisation information on New Zealand children since 2005 and has been collecting some adult immunisation information since 201 4. The purpose of the NIR is to facilitate immunisation delivery and provide an accurate record of an individual 's immunisation history. The NIR also: provides a more accurate record of immunisation coverage rates regionally and nationally - this information assists with better programme planning to improve coverage rates and identify areas with lower immunisation rates collects information about the Schedule, and some targeted programmes (eg, Tdap during pregnancy, BCG vaccine) collects informatio n about influenza immunisations and high -risk adolescent and adult immunisations (since July 2014) enables health professionals to identify quickly and easily which vaccines an individual has received (especially if they have moved areas or changed health care providers) and any that are due or may have been missed enables individuals to have an accurate, up -to-date record of their immunisation history. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 71 2.3.6 Managing the information on the National Immunisation Register The information held on the NIR (collecti on, holding, use and disclosure) is governed by the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 and section 22F of the Health Act 1956 (see section 2.1.2). The NIR 's priva cy policy can be found on the Ministry of Health website (www.health.govt.nz/nir ). The policy sets out the framework for data collection, storage, use and disclosure of health information held about identifiabl e individuals on the NIR. Individuals or their parents/guardians may choose at any time not to have any health information collected on the register (ie, they can opt out of the further collection of immunisation data, recorded as an 'opt-off'). However, the NIR will retain the individual 's National Health Index (NHI) number, date of birth, DHB they are resident in, date they opted out and any immunisation information recorded before they opted out. The reason for retaining this information is to provide a n accurate denominator for immunisation coverage calculations, and to prevent inappropriate recall and referral. An individual 's immunisation information will be retained on the NIR for their whole life, plus a period of 10 years after their death. Only authorised users have access to the information held on the NIR. Such a person is authorised to use and disclose NIR information in accordance with their function. Penalties for unauthorised disclosure of information could include the revocation of authorised user privileges, complaints to the Privacy Commissioner, civil proceedings, professional sanctions and disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Information collected on the NIR includes: date of vaccination individual 's name individual 's NHI number individual 's date of birth secondary contact details parent/guardian details for children aged under 18 years vaccine type and number in the series batch number and expiry date injection site, injection route and needle length used provider name vaccinator 's name and title recall date (when applicable) adverse event data, once verified by CARM. 72 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 More information about privacy and informed consent can be found in section 2.1.2 and Appendix 3 . Further information about the NIR can be found on the Ministry of Health website ( www.health.govt.nz/nir ). The SBVS The SBVS collects and manages the data for school immunisation programmes (eg, where public health nurses deliver the school year 7 and year 8 immunisation programmes). The info rmation collected on the SBVS for the school immunisation programmes is then transferred to the NIR. Not all DHBs use the SBVS software for managing their school -based programmes; however, all DHBs are required to record school -based vaccination events on the NIR regardless of whether they use the SBVS or a PMS, or direct enter on to the NIR.

There are no known contraindications to administering registered vaccines at the same visit, provided they are administered in separate syringes at separate sites. If two or more parenterally or intranasally administered live vaccines are not given at the same visit, then a minimum interval of four weeks is recommended. The rati onale is based on limited data where VV has been given within four weeks of measles -containing vaccine and breakthrough varicella disease (chickenpox) has occurred. Any time interval is acceptable between administering live oral vaccines (eg, rotavirus) an d live parenteral vaccines (BCG), live and inactive vaccines, or two inactive vaccines. What steps are required if the Schedule is interrupted or varied? Generally, there is no need to repeat prior doses; simply continue the Schedule as if no interruption has occurred (see Appendix 2 ). Special circumstances where the above does not apply are as follows: HepB given at birth to babies born to HBsAg -positive mothers - this dose does not count as part of a catch -up the two -dose course of rotavirus vaccine (RV1; Rotarix) should be started before age 15 weeks (ie, the latest is 14 weeks and 6 days) and completed by age 25 weeks (ie, the latest is 24 weeks and 6 days); if an infant reaches age 25 weeks without receiving the second dose, the first dose already given may offer them some protection against disease MMR given prior to age 12 months - infants who receive MMR prior to age 12 months still require two further MMR doses beyond age 12 months (scheduled at ages 12 months and 15 months) IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 75 conjugate vaccine schedule requirements, which are age dependent (eg, children over 12 m onths of age do not require a full primary course of Hib -PRP or PCV vaccine, but do require one or two doses in the second year of life; see Appendix 2 ) when reconciling overseas schedules and the New Zealand Schedule - immigrant children who have commenced vaccine courses (eg, MenACWY, 4CMenB, PCV13) are not funded to complete these vaccine courses once in New Zealand unless they meet the high -risk criteria fo r these vaccines; however, if the parent or guardian wishes to purchase the vaccines to complete the course, they may do so. Remember that children who miss one vaccine dose may do so again, so optimising a catch -up schedule is important. How should the rest of the Schedule be handled when an adverse event has occurred following immunisation? Proceeding with the Schedule after an AEFI depends on the nature of the event and the likelihood that the vaccine caused it. Most prior adverse events are not contra indications to receiving further immunisations. The only absolute contraindication to receiving a vaccine is anaphylaxis to a prior dose or an ingredient in the vaccine. However, immunocompromise can be a contraindication to receiving live vaccines (see section 4.3). Adverse events should be reported to CARM ( https://nzphvc.otago.ac.nz/reporting ). See section 1.6.3 'AEFI reporting process notifying CARM '. Consult the AEFI section in eac h of the Handbook chapters, and seek specialist advice (eg, from the local medical officer of health, the Ministry of Health or IMAC). Other vaccines not related to the AEFI can usually be administered as per the Schedule. 3.1.2 Babies and children What if a ba by had a difficult birth or was premature? Preterm and/or low birthweight infants should receive vaccination as per the Schedule (ie, at the usual chronological age, with the usual vaccine dosage and interval), including rotavirus vaccination. These babies may be at higher risk of some of these diseases, so vaccinating them on time is particularly important. Infants with serious congenital conditions should generally receive Schedule vaccines at the usual chronological age. However, if the infant is still i n hospital or has recently been discharged, please seek the advice of the treating specialist (see also section 4.2.2). Rotavirus vaccine should be given on time to hospitalised infants, including those in neonatal units. When standard infection control precautions are maintained, the risk of rotavirus vaccine virus transmission will be minimal.1, 2, 3 (See also sections 4.2.4, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and chapter 18.) 76 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 What special vaccines are offered to newborn babies? Babies born to HBsAg -positive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) neonatal, at or as close as possible to birth a birth dose of HepB (Engerix -B, 20 \u00b5g or paediatric formulation, Engerix -B 10 \u00b5g, if available), which should be given at or as close as possible to birth (preferably within 12 hours). If HBIG and/or HepB is inadvertently omitted, admin ister as soon as the omission is recognised. HBIG can be administered up to seven days post -delivery. If there is a delay for longer than seven days, seek specialist advice. These babies should then continue as per the Schedule at ages 6 weeks, 3 months an d 5 months. Serological testing is required at 9 months of age (see section 9.5.2). A baby at higher risk of TB is offered a BCG immunisation soon after birth (see section 21.5 for neonatal BCG eligibility and the timing of neonatal BCG). The lead maternity carer will discuss the need for the vaccine with the mother prior to her baby 's birth and vaccination will be conducted at designated BCG clinics within each district health board. What are the special requirements of immigrant children? Immigrant children should be immunised according to the New Zealand Schedule with due account taken of documented prior vaccine administration and the eligibility criteria defined in the Health and Disability Services Eligibility Direction 2011 , available on the Ministry of Health website at www.health.govt.nz/eligibility (see also section 4.7). All children aged under 18 years are eligible to receive Schedule vaccines and Well Child Tamariki Ora services regardless of their immigration and citizenship status, and providers can claim the immunisation benefit for administering the vaccines. If a refugee or immigrant has no valid documentation of vaccination, an age - appropriate catch -up programme is recommended. Only clearly documented doses should be considered as given. If there is no documented vaccination history, plan the catch -up schedule assuming the vaccines have not been given (see Appendix 2 ). The immunisation status of all immigrant children should be checked when they register with a primary health care provider. Is it possible to boost a child 's immune system by other means? Eating a healthy diet, getting adequate sleep and exercise, having a smoke -free environment and minimising high levels of stress will help keep the child 's immune system healthy. However, none of the above confers the disease -specific immunity that vaccination prov ides (see also section 3.2.4). All children get infections (eg, common colds); this does not mean the immune system is not working. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 77 3.1.3 Allergies and illnesses What if the child is unwell on the day of immunisation? Minor illness or being in the recovery phase of an illness is not a reason to postpone immunisation. Babies and children with a significant acute illness and a temperature >38\u00b0C should have immunisation postp oned until they are better. This is not because they are at particular risk of vaccine reactions, but because complications of the acute illness may be misinterpreted as a complication of the immunisation, or an AEFI may complicate the clinical picture of the acute illness. (See section 2.1.4 'Contraindications ' and the contraindications sections in the disease chapters.) If immunisation is postponed, it is important to ensure the child is placed on the recall for the immunisation later. What if the child is due to have an operation (elective surgery)? There is no evidence that anaesthetic impairs the immune response to a vaccine or increases the risk of AEFI. Vaccination with inactive vaccines is preferably avoided for 48 hours prior to an anaesthe tic in case post -vaccination symptoms such as fever interfere with preparation for surgery; similarly, live vaccines may induce fever 6 -12 days after vaccination. There is no reason to delay surgery following vaccination with a live vaccine if the child is well at the time of immediate pre -operative assessment. There is no reason to delay vaccination after surgery once the child is well and has recovered from the procedure. See the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland Immunis ation guideline ( www.apagbi.org.uk/guidelines ). Ideally, individuals scheduled for splenectomy should be immunised at least two weeks before the operation. Pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hib, influenza and varicella vaccines are recommended for these individuals pre - or post -splenectomy (see section 4.3.4 and the relevant disease chapters). Note: If the surgery is an emergency, then the immunisation programme should commence seven days post -splenectomy. Can immunisations be given during an operation? Vaccination can be administered while a child is under anaesthesia.4 What if the child has a chronic disease? Children with chronic diseases should be immunised in the normal way, especially as they may be more at risk from the severe effects of vaccine -preventa ble diseases. However, if the illness or its treatment results in impaired immunity, immunisation with live vaccines should be considered carefully (see section 4.3), and the child 's GP or paediatrician should be consulted before immunisation. 78 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 What if the child has had seizures? A diagnosed neurological condition is not a contraindication to any vaccine on the Schedule. A history of well -controlled seizures in the vaccine recipient or a family history of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or other neurologic disorder is not a contraindication to vaccination against pertussis.5 Vaccination for children with an unstable neurological disorder (eg, poorly controlled epilepsy or dete riorating neurological state) has previously been considered a precaution for pertussis vaccination, but as these children may be high risk of severe pertussis complications, vaccination is recommended. Individual cases should be discussed with the special ist.5 A febrile reaction may occur after any vaccine and result in a fe brile seizure in a susceptible child. Vaccine -related febrile seizures are rare, although the risk is higher following administration of certain vaccines, such as influenza vaccine ( section 11.7), MMR (section 12.7) and meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB, Bexsero; see section 13.7.3 ). These seizures, although frighte ning for a parent, are almost always benign with no associated sequelae. What if the child is allergic? Only anaphylaxis to a prior dose of vaccine, or to an ingredient in the vaccine, is considered an absolute contraindication. See the contraindications and precautions section in each disease chapter. Children with asthma, eczema, hay fever and other allergies should be immunised in the usual way. Studies have shown that immunised children have slightly lower rates of atopic diseases.6, 7 Can children be immunised if they are known to develop a rash with antibiotics? Children can be immunised if they are known to develop a rash with antibiotics. Only anaphylaxis to a prior dose of vaccine, or to an ingredient in the vaccine, is considered an absolute contraindication to vaccination. A rash alone is not anaphylaxis. Can all children receive all the vaccines? A child cannot receive a vaccine if they hav e had anaphylaxis to a prior dose of a vaccine or to an ingredient in the vaccine. A child may have an underlying condition that is a contraindication to some vaccines; for example, children with illnesses or treatments that cause immunocompromise may be u nable to receive live attenuated vaccines (see chapter 4 for special groups, chapters 12, 14 and 19 for MMR and chapter 22 for varicella). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 79 3.1.4 Parents, guardians and contacts What if the child 's mother or guardian is pregnant or breastfeeding? These are not contrain dications to giving any of the Schedule vaccines to a child, including live vaccines, such as MMR. In addition, consideration should be given to the risks for the mother or guardian and baby from diseases such as pertussis, which can be life -threatening in infants. Pregnancy provides an important opportunity to ensure the infant 's siblings have received age -appropriate immunisation. Pertussis (as Tdap) and influenza vaccines are recommended and funded for pregnant women (see section 4.1). Are the viruses in live vaccines, such as MMR and varic ella, transmissible? These are highly attenuated (weakened) viruses designed specifically to induce an immune response without causing disease. There have been no recorded cases of measles, mumps or rubella disease in individuals who were in contact with a vaccine recipient. Vaccine -strain varicella transmission to contacts is rare (documented in only 9 immunised people, resulting in 11 secondary cases), and the documented risk of transmission exists only if the immunised person develops a rash8 (see chapters 12, 14 and 19 for MMR and chapter 22 for varicella). 3.2 Addressing myths and concerns about immunisation Myths about immunisation have existed since the first use of smallpox vaccine over 200 years ago and have resulted in loss of confidence in immuni sation programmes. Misconceptions about vaccines contribute to vaccine hesitancy, which is an issue of global concern. This section provides information to assist providers with addressing concerns about immunisation. 3.2.1 Background Concerns about immunisatio n should be taken seriously and responded to appropriately, providing as much information as possible. Individuals have the right to make informed decisions for themselves and those in their care, and to accept responsibility for their decisions. It is imp ortant to respect this right. 80 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Many individuals and groups actively campaign against immunisation in New Zealand and globally. Their reasons for doing so may include personal experience, such as an adverse event they have attributed to immunisation, philoso phical beliefs, conspiratorial beliefs or dissatisfaction with inadequate or supercial responses from health professionals or other authorities, who can seem at times to be dismissive of people 's concerns. It is important for all health professionals to b e able to provide accurate information about the benefits and risks of immunisation and to respond with as much information as possible to parent/guardian concerns or refer people appropriately. It is not always possible to change people 's position by way of scientific argument or presentation of evidence. Anti -immunisation arguments are almost exclusively based on fallacies of fact or logic, or on historical information that is no longer applicable in the current context. Often these arguments can be chal lenging for the health professional, particularly if the professional is unfamiliar with the argument and when they are complicated by logical flaws. In any discussion, it may help to acknowledge that science does not always have all the answers, but that it provides a tool with which to answer questions and evaluate the evidence. It is important to point out that an event that follows immunisation is not necessarily caused by the immunisation. Finally, it is always helpful to inform parents/ guardians about additional sources of reliable information (see section 2.1.2 on informed consent and section 1.6 on the safety monitoring of vaccines in New Zealand). 3.2.2 Understanding anti -immunisation People tend to take on board information that supports their belief system and to ignore information that does not. The internet makes it very easy to access material that is appealing. Most people usually make logical decisions based on their perception of risk. Therefore, when a person has the perception that the risk of disease is real and that vaccines are reasonably safe and work, they are more likely to vaccinate. People are unlikely to vaccinate if they perceive that there is little risk of disease and that vaccines are not safe and do not work.9 3.2.3 Addressing concerns If a parent is concerned about immunising their child, determining their concerns and addressing them can be helpful. Most often these concerns are around vaccine safety. As a health professional, you should challenge poor information, in a respectful way. There are steps you can take when addressing a parent 's or an individual 's concerns (as detailed on the Canadian Paediatric Soc iety website at www.cps.ca/documents/position/working include the following: IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 81 1. Understand the key role that sound advice from a health professional can play in parental decision making. 2. Use presumptive and motivational interviewing techniques to understand specific vaccine concerns. 3. Use clear and simple language to present evidence of disease risks and vacc ine benefits, fairly and accurately. 4. Address injection pain head on. 5. Explain that community (herd) immunity does not guarantee personal protection. For further information to help to address concerns, see also resources on the IMAC website (immune.org.nz) , and other websites, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Immunization Action Coalition, Sharing Knowledge about Immunisation (SKAI) and the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (see Appendix 9 ). 3.2.4 Debunking a myth Debunking myths can be very challenging and can also backfire. When you are addressing a myth, there are three important points to remember.11 1. Try not to repeat the myth. Focus on the core facts. This is because people cannot remember if what they hear was a myth or a fact later. Debunking can serve to strengthen the myth in people 's minds as either familiar or a threat to their world view. Begin with the core facts. 2. Precede a myth with a warning. Let them know that 'this is untrue ' because you often cannot avoid mentioning the myth. 3. Include an alternative explanation that accounts for how the myth misleads. Do not leave a void but rather replace the myth with accurate information. You can highlight the problems with cherry picking, conspiracy theories and fake experts. If you have them, graphics can be extremely helpful, such as pictures of vaccine -preventable diseases or even a graph showing the impact of vaccination - if you feel it is appropriate. 82 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Facts and myths about immunisation Core fact: Measles and rubella have been eliminated in some countries. The WHO has set targets for global eradication. Myth: MMR causes autism. Explanation: There is no evidence that the MMR causes autism.12, 13 In 1998 a British physician announced he had found an association between the receipt of MMR and the development of a new disorder that included autism in a study of 12 children. No subsequent studies following his study have been able to reproduce his results. In 2004 The Lancet retracted the original 1998 study from the scientific literature on the grounds that it was the product of dishonest and irresponsible research and the British authorities revoked the doctor 's licence to practise medicine.14 In 2008 a press investigation revealed that the doctor had falsified patient data and relied on laboratory reports that he had been warned were incorrect. Multiple stu dies have exonerated MMR vaccination. Core fact: The incidence of allergic diseases has been increasing. It is thought that lack of exposure to microbes may play a role. Myth: Vaccines cause allergic diseases. Explanation: Extensive research shows that, if anything, vaccines may have a protective effect against allergic disease. Many studies have explored this issue. A few have shown a positive association, but the majority show no association or a negative association. The international scientific comm unity generally accepts that vaccines do not lead to allergies and in fact have a small protective effect against the development of allergy.6, 7 The 2012 Institute of Medicine review of adverse events rejected any causal relationship between inactivated influenza vaccine and asthma exacerbation or reactive airway disease episodes in children and adults.13 Core fact: On-time vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of hospitalisation for diseases such as pertussis and pneumococcal disease in children under 1 year of age. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 83 Myth: Vaccines cause cot death. Explanation: Vaccines may reduce the risk for cot death. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), also known as cot death, usually occurs in children aged under 12 months and is most common around age 3 months, when many immunisations are given. SUDI may occur by chance within a day or so of immunisation.15 There is no evidence that vaccination causes SUDI. Despite solid evidence against a link, the claims continue to be made. Many studies have conclusively shown that SUDI is not caused by immunisation.15 Some studies, including the New Zealand Cot Death Study, found a lower rate of SUDI in immunised children.16 This is consistent with a Scandinavian study, which found that some cases of SUDI were probably caused by undiagnosed pertussis.17 A large case - control study showed no increased risk of SUDI associated with immunisation,18 and a meta -analysis of nine case -control studies further suggested that immunisation is protective against SUDI.19 Consistent findings from several studies using a range of methods invalidate claims that associate vaccination with SUDI or cot death.20 Core fact : At birth, an infant is exposed to thousands of microbes. Myth: Vaccines 'overload ' or 'overwhelm ' the infant immune system. Explanation: It is estimated that the infant immune system could respond to over 10,000 vaccines all at once. There is no evidence of immune system 'overload ', either theoretical or actual. The immune system can deal with an extraordinarily large number of different antigens at any one time. Every day we all encounter viruses, bacteria and other agents to which the immune system responds. Any demands placed on the immune system by vaccines are minuscule compared to its ability to respond. Vaccines have very few anti gens in them. The number of immunogenic proteins and polysaccharides in modern vaccines has decreased dramatically compared with early vaccines because of advances in vaccine technology. For example, early whole -cell pertussis vaccines contained around 3,0 00 immunogenic proteins, compared with two to ve in the modern acellular pertussis vaccines. In spite of an increase in the number of vaccines on the Schedule, an infant now receives far fewer immunogenic proteins and polysaccharides than with earlier vac cines.21 There are considerably more antigens in the organisms that cause disease than in the vaccines. Explanation: Delaying immunisation for fear that an infant is too young leaves the infant vulnerable to disease, particularly pertussis and pneumococcal diseases. Infants delayed for their pertussis vaccinations are 4 -6 times more likely to be hospitalised with the di sease.22 On-time vaccination is important. 84 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Core fact : Vaccines induce immunity through natural processes. Myth: It is better to get 'natural immunity ' than get vaccinated. Explanation: There is no evidence that experiencing vaccine -preventable diseases has any benefit on health; on the contrary, these diseases are serious and sometimes fatal. Vaccinated people have fewer diseases than unvaccinated people. Some vaccines induce better prot ection than that resulting from natural disease. Examples are tetanus, HepB and HPV, and protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines administered to children aged under 2 years (Hib -PRP and PCV). Core fact : The scientific evidence shows there is no associat ion between HPV vaccines and autoimmune conditions. Myth: HPV vaccines cause autoimmune conditions. Explanation: Several large cohort studies have been conducted to investigate the link between HPV vaccine and autoimmune conditions.23, 24, 25, 26, 27 No association has been found in these studies. Core fact : The quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine has reduced cervical disease in countries using the vaccine, and Australia has almost eliminate d genital warts. Myth: HPV vaccines cause postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Explanation: There is no scientific evidence that links POTS, CRPS or CFS with HPV vaccination. POTS is a cond ition in which tachycardia occurs when a patient moves from a supine position to upright. The condition is associated with a collection of other symptoms, which include palpitations, light -headedness, weakness, blurred vision, headache, extreme fatigue, na usea, syncope and sleep disturbance. Up to 50 percent of people with POTS have an antecedent viral illness and 25 percent have a family history of similar complaints. There is an overlap between POTS and CFS.28 CRPS describes a variety of disorders characterised by pain that is disproportional to the inciting event. In children and adolescents, it often presents as a painful mottled swollen limb with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Girls are six times more likely to be affected than boys and the peak age of onset is at age 12 -13 years. Often minor traum a is the inciting event, but around one -third of people with CRPS are unable to recall an inciting injury or trauma.29 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 85 CFS is a disorder characterised by extreme fatigue that cannot be explained by an underlying medical condition. The causes are unknown , but it has been linked to infection with Epstein -Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6. Cases of these disorders have been reported in association with HPV vaccination, particularly in the media, and social media. The variable time between vaccination and onset of symptoms, lack of consistent symptoms and a reporting rate that remains below the expected rate for these syndromes all point to HPV vaccine not being the cause of these conditions.30 Post-marketing surveillance systems globally continue to monitor the safety of HPV vaccination programmes.31, 32, 33 The WHO 's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has systematically reviewed HPV vaccine safety and has not found any safety issue that would alter its recommendations for use.34 The main challenge with HPV vaccine is communicating its excellent safety profile.35 Core fact: Everything is made of chemicals and any chemical can be toxic, even water. Myth : Vaccines contain toxic chemicals, viruses and cells. Explanation: Vaccine ingredients are not toxic in the amounts present in a vaccine. It is the dose that differentiates a poison from a harmless substance, essential substance or a medicine. Most of the ingredients in vaccines are present already in our bodies and we consume them in some way every day. For example, aluminium is the most common metallic element on earth, and the body makes and uses formaldehyde for synthesising deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is approximately 60 times more formaldehyde in a pear than a vaccine. Polysorbate 80 is used in many foods, including ice cream. Vaccines do not contain extraneous cells or viruses. Aluminium compounds administered via vaccination do not contribute significantly to the general aluminium exposure and do not raise human serum aluminium levels.36 Based on 80 years of experience, the use of alumi nium adjuvants in vaccines has proven to be extremely safe and effective.37, 38 For more information, see the IMAC factsheet Vaccine Ingredients (available at www.immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). Core fact: With the exception of safe water, no other intervention, not even antibiotics, has had such a major effect on mortality reduction and population growth. - S Plotkin39 86 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Myth: Vaccination has played little role in controlling disease. Explanation: Vaccine programmes have controlled or eliminated polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal papillomavirus, varicella, hepatitis, yellow fever, measles, mumps, rubella and others, in populations where vaccines have been used. Improvements in living conditions and medical care have reduced the chances of dying from infectious disease, but without immunisation most people will still acquire vaccine -preventable infections. For example, measles, which spreads through the air , is largely unaffected by improvements in living conditions other than reduced overcrowding. Indigenous cases of measles, mumps and rubella were eliminated from Finland over a 12 -year period using a two -dose MMR vaccination schedule given between 14 and 1 6 months and at age 6 years.40 In September 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first W HO region to be declared free of measles and rubella. Endemic measles and rubella were declared eliminated in New Zealand in 2017. Core fact: No vaccine is 100 percent effective and some immunised children will get the disease. Myth: Vaccines do not work , as most cases of disease are in immunised children. Explanation: As immunisation coverage increases, the proportion of cases that occur in children who have been immunised compared with those who are unimmunised increases. There is a mathematical relati onship between vaccine effectiveness, immunisation coverage and the proportion of cases that are immunised. To see this clearly, imagine a group of 100 children. If 90 percent of children are given a vaccine with 90 percent efficacy, then: 81 of the 100 c hildren will be immune 10 children will be susceptible because of not having the vaccine, and another 9 because of vaccine failure. This means that in the situation of exposure to the infection in a community, we expect that nearly half the cases of disea se will be in immunised children, even though only 10 percent of immunised children were susceptible. Of course, if all 100 children had been vaccinated only 10 would be susceptible to disease. As vaccine uptake rises, the proportion of cases of disease that occur in vaccinated people increases dramatically, but the absolute number of cases of disease falls to very low levels. Failing to provide the denominators (how many vaccinated and how many unvaccinated) can lead to misunderstanding. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 87 For per tussis, where the protection following immunisation lasts only four to six years, immunised children can be infected but the resultant illness is usually milder, with fewer serious consequences and at an older age than if they had not received vaccine. The disease is most severe in infants, but adolescents and adults contribute to the carriage and spread of the disease (see sections 15.2 and 15.3). For further details on the effectiveness of vaccines, see the 'Written resources ' section of the IMAC website ( www .immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). 3.3 Addressing immunisation issues in a constantly changing environment In recent years, the internet has exploded with a variety of forums that disseminate anti-immunisation material effectively. It is no longer practical to prepare official rebuttals to each new article. Fortunately, the internet also facilitates the rapid communication of scientific commentary on new misinformation as they appear. There are several scientists who regularly address immunis ation myths in the form of regular blogs. In addition, some organisations provide position statements and discussion forums. While the format is often colloquial, the writers are respected scientists who volunteer commentary against the abuse of science an d evidence -based medicine . References 1.

The topics covered are: pregnancy and lactation (section 4.1) infants with special immunisation considerations from birth (section 4.2) immunocompromised individuals (section 4.3) chronic kidney disease (section 4.4) chronic liver disease (section 4.5) other special groups (section 4.6) immigrants and refugees (section 4.7) occupation -related vaccinations (section 4.8) travel (section 4.9). Note: Vaccinators are advised to check the Pharmaceutical Schedule and any online updates (available at www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for changes to funding decisions for special groups. 4.1 Pregnancy and lactation 4.1.1 Women planning pregnancy Women who are planning pregnancy should know whether they are immune to measles, rubella and Two doses of MMR are recommended and funded for eligible women who do not have documented evidence of immunity to measles, mumps and rubella (see section 12.8.3 for evidence). Pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after vaccination (see section 19.6.1 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 91 Varicella vaccine Two doses of VV are recommended but not funded for adul ts who are susceptible to varicella (see section 22.5). VV should not be given to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after vaccination (see section 22.5.4 ). 4.1.2 During pregnancy Subunit vaccines are considered safe in pregnancy. Live vaccines should not be administered to a pregnant woman because of the theoretical possibility of fetal harm. Seek specialist advice in circumstances where the risk of exposure to an infection outweighs any potential risk of the fetus from immunisation . Although MMR should not be given to women who are pregnant, in follow -up studies of women who inadvertently received MMR during pregnancy, there was no evidence that MMR is teratogenic or harmful to the mother, her fetus or her newborn.1 Inadvertent immunisation with a rubella -containing vaccine in early pregnancy is no longer considered an indication for termination of pregnancy.1 See the relevant disease chapters, 22.8.6 ), for recommendations on managing exposure to diseases during pregnancy. Influenza vaccine The quadrivalent influenza vaccine is recommended and funded for pregnant women and should be offered to women at any stage of pregnancy, as soon as the annual influenza vaccine becomes available (see section 11.5). Both the pregnant woman and her fetus are at increased risk of influenza complications;2, 3 influenza vaccination is therefore recommended during pregnancy to reduce this risk.4 Maternal influenza vaccination also offers protection to the neonate through maternal antibody transfer.3, 4 Influenza vaccines are not registered for infants aged under 6 months; therefore vaccination during pregnancy helps protect newborns and infants who are too young to be vaccinated.2, 3 Maternal influenza vaccination is significantly associated with reduced risk of influenza virus infection5 and hospi talisation for an influenza -like illness in infants up to 6 months of age.3, 5 There is no evidence that influenza vaccine prepared from a virus subunit causes harm to the fetus or neonate.6, 7, 8 Pertussis vaccine (Tdap) Pertussis is a severe infection in infants too young to have been fully immunised. The tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine (Tdap) is recommended and funded to be given from 16 weeks ' gestation in every pregnancy , preferably in the second trimester, to protect both the mother and her infant from pertussis (see section 15.5).9, 10, 11 Postpartum maternal Tdap vaccina tion can reduce the risk of a mother infecting her baby but does not have the added benefit of providing passive antibodies. 92 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 See section 15.5 for in formation about maternal pertussis vaccine effectiveness and safety. Close contacts Confirmation of pregnancy should act as a trigger to review the pertussis vaccination status of all the pregnant woman 's close contacts. This includes making sure siblings have received the usual Schedule vaccines and offering Tdap to adults, although this is only currently funded for certain special groups. 4.1.3 Breastfeeding and post -partum All vaccines on the National Immunisation Schedule and those recommended for special g roups are safe for breastfeeding women. Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine Up to two doses of MMR are recommended and funded after delivery for eligible women who do not have documented evidence of immunity to measles, mumps and rubella. Breastfeeding is not a (see section 12.8.3 ). Pertussis vaccine (Tdap) A single dose of Tdap is funded for parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or special care baby unit for more than three days and whose mothers had not received Tdap at least 14 days prior to birth. A single do se of Tdap is also recommended but not funded for all new mothers who did not receive a Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. Varicella vaccine VV is recommended but not funded for all susceptible adults. Pregnant women who are non -immune can be offered VV after delivery . If the mother is susceptible to varicella, VV for the mother is recommended and funded after delivery if the baby or other household members are immunocompromised (see section 22.5). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 93 4.2 Infants with special immunisation considerations from birth Further details are given in section 4.3 for infants born with primary immunodeficien cy, including Down syndrome (section 4.3.3), secondary immunodeficiency (section 4.3.4), functional HIV (section 4.3.12 ). 4.2.1 Infants born to mothers with positive or unknown hepatitis B (HBsAg) status Infants born to mothers who are known to be HBsAg -positive require hepatitis B vaccine (Hep B) plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) to be given at or as soon as possible after birth; to continue vaccination as per the Schedule at 6 weeks, 3 and 5 months; and to undergo serological testing for hepatitis B antigen and antibodies (HBsAg and anti -HBs) at 9 months of age. Infants of mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown at the time of delivery require HepB at birth while waiting for the results of urgent HBsAg testing on the mother (see section 9.5.2). If mother is found to be HBsAg positive, HBIG will also be required. 4.2.2 Preterm and/or low birthweight infants Vaccination as per the Schedule (ie, at the usual chronological age, with the usual vaccine dosage and interval) is recommended for preterm and/or low birthweight infants. There is a potential risk of apnoea in preterm infants with respiratory immaturity. Apnoea monitoring should be considered after the first vaccination event.10 For infants who experience apnoea after their first vaccination event, apnoea monitoring should be considered for 48 -72 hou rs after subsequent vaccination events, but avoiding or delaying vaccination is not recommended.12 Hepatitis B vaccine All preterm and low birthweight infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers should be managed the same way as term infants and receive HepB and HBIG to be given at or as soon as possible after birth (see section 9.5.2). These infants should continue vaccination as per the usual Schedule, starting at age 6 weeks. 94 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Rotavirus vaccine If an infant is in hospital at 6 weeks old, the Schedule vaccines, including rotavirus vaccine, should be given in hospital. Standard infection control precaut ions should be maintained. Administration of rotavirus vaccine to medically stable, hospitalised infants at 6 weeks of age has been shown to be well -tolerated. No increase in nosocomial rotavirus transmission has been observed within neonatal intensive car e units.13, 14, 15 Rotavirus vaccine can be given to preterm infants who are receiving corticosteroids. For immunocompromised infants or mothers, also see section 4.3.3 and section 4.3.6. Pneumococcal vaccines Infants born before 28 weeks ' gestation are eligible for pneumococcal vaccination as part of an extended immunisation programme for high risk groups (see section 16.5.2 ). Infants born at 28 weeks ' gestation or later, who do not have a condition eligible for extended pneumococcal immunisation, should receive PCV10 (Synflorix) as per the Schedule at ages 6 weeks, 5 months and 12 months. Influenza vaccine Preterm and/or low birth weight infants with an eligible condition are recommended to receive an annual funded influenza vaccination from 6 months of age (see Table 11.2). Influenza vaccination is recommended (but not funded) for close contacts of preterm infants, including children from age 6 months (see section 11.5.4 ). Pertussis v accine (Tdap) It is essential that siblings of preterm infants are up to date with Schedule vaccinations, to reduce the risk of pertussis transmission to the infant (see section 15.5). Adolescents should have received Tdap in year 7 or at age 11 years as part of the Schedule. Pertussis -containing vaccine is funded for primary and catch -up vaccination of all children aged under 18 years (see Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules). A single dose of Tdap is recommended and funded for parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or specia l care baby unit for more than three days and whose mother did not receive maternal Tdap vaccination at least 14 days before the baby 's birth. Regardless of maternal vaccination history, it is recommended that all caregivers of infants born at less than 32 weeks ' gestation receive a single dose of Tdap (not funded). This is because by 28 -32 weeks ' gestation the level of transplacental maternal antibodies in the infant is only half of the maternal circulating level, compared with higher than maternal levels b y term.9, 16, 17 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 95 4.2.3 Infants with congenital heart disease Congenital heart disease (CHD) may occur alone (eg, a single ventricle defect or shunt dependent other congenital defects (eg, immunodefici ency, endocrine dysfunction and facial abnormalities in DiGeorge syndrome or asplenia in heterotaxy syndrome). Vaccination of infants with congenital heart disease Infants with CHD and who are immunocompetent can receive vaccination as per the Schedule in cluding rotavirus and varicella vaccines. For infants with CHD who were also born preterm or with a low birthweight, see also section 4.2.2. Infants with a complex single ventricle defect or shunt dependent lesion who have undergone the Norwood procedure may have an increased risk of systemic decompensation. There is limited evid ence linking the onset of decompensation to vaccination. As a precautionary measure, these infants may require hospital admission for observation or close parental monitoring at home for 48 -72 hours after vaccination events. Discuss monitoring requirements with the infant 's specialist prior to vaccination.18 Timing of vaccination may be affected when cardiac surgery is scheduled to avoid adding extra stress on these infants during this time. Vaccines should be administered at least one week before planned cardiac surgery. After cardiac surgery, administration of subunit vaccines should be delayed by 4 -6 weeks for those at risk of systemic decompensation (eg , after a Norwood procedure). For further information see Starship guidelines av ailable from https://www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/immunisations -and-cardiac -infants/ Live vaccines - caution If an infant has received blood products (eg, bypass o r blood transfusion during surgery), delay administration of live vaccine is until seven months post -surgery.18 This does not apply to administration of rotavirus vaccine. See Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 for suggested intervals between administration of blood products and MMR or VV. If no blood products have been given, the usual 4 -6 weeks post -operative interval is recommended for those at risk of systemic decompensation, as above. Some cardiac defects can be associated with immune deficiency, eg Di George syndrome. Most such patients can safely be given live viral vaccines when due - after assessment of immune function (see section 4.3.3). Seek specialist advice. 96 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Pneumococcal va ccine Children who have cardiac disease with cyanosis or failure, chronic pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, functional asplenia, immunodeficiency, or renal failure are eligible for extended pneumococcal immunisations as high -risk groups (see section 16.5.2 ). Influenza vaccine Infants and children with CHD, with or without cyanosis or failure, and children on long-term aspirin are eligible to receive funded annual influenza vaccination from 6 months of age (see Table 11.2). Influenza vaccination is recommended (but not funded) for close contacts of infants and children wi th CHD, including children (see section 11.5.4 ). Pertussis vaccination It is essential that siblings and other close household contacts of infants with CHD are up to date with Schedule vaccinations, to reduce the risk of pertussis transmission to the infant (see section 15.5). Ensure catch -up vaccination of all children aged u nder 18 years (see Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules). Varicella vaccine Children on long -term aspirin can receive varicella vaccination as per the Schedule. There has been no reported association between varicella vaccination and the onset of Reye 's syndrome in children on long -term aspirin to prevent thrombosis. The use of aspirin during natural chickenpox infection has been associated with Reye 's syndrome.18 4.2.4 Infants with immunocompromise , including primary immunodeficiencies from birth Seek guidance on immunisation of infants with severe primary immunodeficiencies (see section 4.3.3). Often these infants are unable to mount adequate responses to vaccines. Note: Rotavirus vaccine is contraindicated in any infant with possible severe combined immune deficiencies (SCID) due to the risk of chronic diarrhoea and prolonged viral shedding.19, 20 Some infants with congenital liver or kidney conditions are likely to need transplantation. An accelerated immunisation schedule for these infants in provided in Table 4.3. Extra immunisations may be warranted for other chronic kidney and chronic liver conditions ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Infants with biliary atresia may have polysplenia (functional hyposplenia; see section 4.3.11 ). Infants of mothers who have received biologic immunosuppressant therapy during pregnancy also may have a reduced response to the primary se ries vaccinations (section 4.3.6). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 97 4.3 Immunocompromised individuals The nature and degree of immunocompromise determines an individual 's immune response and which vaccines are recommended and can be safely administered. Individuals who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to a disease and/or treatment may have an increased risk from infectious diseases. These individuals should be vaccinated as a m atter of priority. Children aged under 18 years, and adults aged 18 years or older who are eligible to receive publicly funded health and disability services in New Zealand, are eligible to receive the usual Schedule vaccines and additional funded vaccines when they meet the eligibility criteria for special groups. Vaccinators are advised to regularly check the Pharmaceutical Schedule and any online updates ( www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for changes to funding deci sions for special groups. It is important to ensure that the household contacts of these individuals are immune to vaccine -preventable diseases whenever possible. The following definitions are used in this Handbook : Immunocompetent - a broad term referri ng to normal immune system function. Immunocompromise - a broad term referring to altered immune system function. The individual 's ability to mount an immune response may be reduced or increased because of a disease, treatment or genetic disorder. Immunomo dulation - changes in immune system function in response to medication, cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatments. Immunostimulant - a substance able to stimulate or increase an immune response. Immunosuppression - a reduced ability to mount an immune response caused by medication, cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment. Immunodeficiency - a reduced ability to mount an immune response and fight off infection. Immunodeciency conditions are classified as primary and secondary, dependent on the cause. 98 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 4.3.1 Vaccination of close contacts of immunocompromised individuals Immuno competent siblings , household and other close contacts of immunocompromised individuals are recommended to receive all the Schedule vaccines at the recommended ages . All Schedule vaccines can be given to close contacts of immunocompromised individuals. It is important to ensure that close contacts are immune for the added protection of the immunocompromised individual. If indicated by the usual BCG eligibility criteria (see section 21.5.2 ), it is safe to give BCG vaccine to infants of immunocompromised household contacts. Rotavirus vaccine Rotavirus vaccine can be given to infants who are in close contact with an immunocompromised individual. The evidence shows that transmission of the rotavirus vaccine virus to contacts is low, and no cases were symptomatic.13, 14, 15 Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine MMR can be given to children and eligible adults who are in close contact with an immunocompromised individual. MMR vaccine viruses are considered non - transmissible; there is no evidence of the current MMR vaccine viruses being transmitted from vaccine recipient to a close contact.21, 22 See section 12.5 for information about eligibility and the recommended MMR vaccination schedu le. Varicella (VV) or zoster (ZV) vaccine can be given to close contacts of an immunocompromised individual. Transfer of vaccine virus to an immunocompromised person is rare and only possible if the vaccinated person develops a varicella - or zoster -like rash. In this situation, the rash should be covered and close contact with the person who is immunocompromised avoided for the duration of the rash.23 (See sections 22.5 and 23.5 for eligibility.) Influenza vaccine Annual influenza vaccination is recommended but not funded for all children aged 6 months or ol der and adults, particularly those who are close contacts of an immunocompromised individual. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 99 4.3.2 Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy Specialist advice must be sought before administering any vaccine to individuals who are currently being tr eated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or have discontinued treatment within the past six months. A cautious approach to vaccination is recommended when balancing an individual 's risk of developing an immune -related adverse event, their potential risks of disease and the potential benefits of vaccination during, and for 6 months after, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. There are four immune checkpoint inhibitor medications currently available in New Zealand. Nivolumab targets CTLA -4 protein. Target proteins (checkpoints) on healthy cells help the immune system distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' and prevent t he immune system from attacking 'self'. Some tumour cells develop these checkpoints so they will not be seen as 'altered self ' by the immune system and attacked. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses specially designed monoclonal antibodies to block the checkpoints on both healthy cells and tumour cells, allowing the tumour cells to be recognised as 'altered self ' and attacked by the immune system.24 The stimulated immune system may also no longer distinguish healthy cells.24 Immune - related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, including rhabdomyolysis Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myopathy, nephritis, fatal myositis, myocarditis, and other autoimmune conditions, are well - documented.25, 26 There is a theoretical risk that an immune response to vaccina tion could trigger the onset of an irAE.27 There is limited published safety data on the use of vaccines (live or subunit) in individuals being treated with one or more immune checkpoint inhibitors. Study numbers are still small, and there are conflicting study outcomes (eg, an increase in irAEs27 and no increase in irAEs28 following influenza vaccination). There are currently no international consensus statements on the use of vaccines in individuals being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. 100 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 4.3.3 Primary immunodecie ncy Primary immunodeciencies that present in childhood are usually caused by an inherited genetic disorder. They can result in defects in antibody production (B-lymphocyte disorders), defects in the development of cell -mediated immunity (T-lymphocyte diso rders), combination defects (disorders or syndromes affecting B- and T -lymphocytes) and defects of complement and phagocytic function.29 Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk from respiratory and severe infec tions due to multiple immune deficits in both the innate and adaptive immune systems, as well as anatomical structural differences,30, 31 and should be considered as primary immune deficiency. Vaccines for individuals with a primary immunodeficiency Live vaccines - caution Diagnosis of primary immunodeciency is often not made before children start their Schedule vaccinations. For infants who have the potential to be immunodeficient (eg, have a familial history of inherited immunodeficiency, administration of live vaccines such as BCG, rotavirus vaccine, MMR, and/or varicella vaccines may be contraindicated or need to be deferred until the infant is identified as being immunocompetent. Live vaccines are contraindicated for all individuals with T lymphocyte -mediated immunodeficiency or a combined B- and T -lymphocyte deficiency. Most of these individuals will be on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy, which provides passive protection against most vaccine -preventable infections. Influenza vaccine Influenza vaccine is funded for a ll individuals with primary immunodeficiency, including Down syndrome, aged 6 months or older. Regardless of their age, all immunodeficient individuals who receive influenza vaccine for the first time are recommended to receive two vac cine doses at least f our weeks apart (second dose unfunded), and one funded dose annually after that. A second dose is funded for children aged 6 months to under 9 years when influenza vaccine is being used for the first time. Pneumococcal vaccines Infants and children aged under 5 years Children in this age group with a diagnosed primary immunodeficiency or Down syndrome are eligible to receive extended pneumococcal immunisation for high -risk groups (see section 16.5.2 ). A course of PCV13 vaccine at 6 weeks and 3, 5 and 12 months replaces doses of PCV10 vaccine on the usual Schedule (see sections 16.5.2 ) followed by age-appropriate 23PPV vaccinations. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 101 Children aged 5 years or older and adults Children age 5 years or older and adul ts with a diagnosed primary immunodeficiency or inherited complement deficiency are eligible to receive one PCV13 followed by age-appropriate 23PPV vaccinations (see section 16.5.2 ). Children with Down syndrome aged 5 years to under 18 years Children in this age group who have received at least two doses of PCV10 and have Down syndrome are recommended and funded to receive one PCV13 followed by up to two doses of 23P PV (see section 16.5.2 ). Children in this age group who have not received at least two doses of PCV10 and have Down syndrome are recommended and funded to receive up to two doses of 23PPV (see section 16.5.2 ). Meningococcal conjugate vaccines The current funded meningococcal possibility of blunting of some PCV serotype antibody responses when MenACWY -D (Menactra) is given concurrently with PCV13 because both vaccines contain diphtheria -derived proteins as conjugate. The clinical significance of this blunting, observed in a clinical trial with PCV7,32 is unknown and the affected serotypes (4, 6B, 18C) are currently rare in New Z ealand. The benefits of achieving broad meningococcal protection as early as possible in immunocompromised infants outweigh the theoretical risk of modest reduction of some pneumococcal antibody levels, such that, MenACWY -D is recommended at age 9 months ( see Table 4.4 and Table 4.5) rather than waiting until after completion of the PCV13 series. Note: two doses of MenACWY -D given at least three months apart are recommended as a primary series: each dose should be given m ore than four weeks after PCV13, if possible, to reduce this risk of interference. Infants aged under 9 months Infants aged under 9 months who have an inherited complement deficiency are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenC given a minimum of eight weeks apart. For broader meningococcal group coverage in infants aged 6 weeks to 9 months, MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) is also available but not funded (see section 13.5). Infants and children aged 9 -23 months Infants and children aged 9 -23 months who are diagnosed with an inherited complement deficiency are recommended and funded to receive t wo doses of MenACWY -D at least three months apart, followed by a booster dose after three years then five-yearly. MenACWY -D is recommended to be given at least four weeks after PCV13. 102 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Children aged 2 years to under 8 years Children aged 2 years to under 8 years who are diagnosed with an inherited complement deficiency are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart, followed by a booster dose after three years then five-yearly. Children aged 9 years or older and adults Children aged 9 years or older and adults who are diagnosed with an inherited complement deficiency are recommended and funded to receiv e two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart, followed by a booster dose every five years. Group B meningococcal recombinant vaccine (4CMenB) Vaccination with 4CMenB, to protect against disease caused by the group B meningococcal serotype, is recom mended (but not funded) for infants, children and adults with an inherited complement deficiency and an increased risk of meningococcal disease. Vaccines used to test for a primary immunodeficiency Hib-PRP, 23PPV and Tdap vaccines may be used in testing f or a primary immunodeficiency, on the recommendation of an internal medicine physician or paediatrician. Hib -PRP and Tdap vaccines are funded for primary immunodeficiency testing in children aged under 18 years and eligible adults. Vaccination advice, by primary immunodeficiency Below is a summary of the vaccination recommendations for individuals with a primary immunodeficiency.29 (See also Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 .) Live vaccines are contraindicated for all individuals with T lymphocyte -mediated immunodeficiency or a combined B - and T -lymphocyte deficiency. Most of these individuals will be on IVIG replacement therapy, which provides passive protection against most vaccine -preventable infections. B lymphocyte deficiencies (humoral) X-linked agammaglobulinaemia and common variable immune deciency administer live -virus vaccines (rotavirus, MMR, VV, ZV) after discussion with the individual 's specialist. The efcacy of any vaccine that is dependent on a humoral response, such as 23PPV, is doubtful. During IVIG therapy, only influ enza vaccination is recommended. Selective IgA deficiency, IgG subclass and hypogammaglobulinaemia BCG vaccine (rotavirus, MMR, VV, can be administered. All vaccines are probably effective. Influe nza vaccine is recommended. Combined lymphocyte deficiencies (T and B cell) Complete defects (eg , SCID or athymia) All live vaccines are contraindicated . All other vaccines are likely to be ineffective prior to immune reconstitution, and passive protectio n must be optimised. Partial defects (eg , most patients with DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia) Provision of selected live vaccines is dependent on specialist advice after assessment of degree of immune compromise. Hib, pn eumococcal (PCV13 and 23PPV), and meningococcal vaccines are recommended, except when the individual receives IVIG therapy. Non-live vaccines should be provided as per the usual Schedule, except when the individual receives IVIG therapy. Influenza vaccinat ion is recommended, including individuals who receive IVIG therapy. deficiencies Deciency of C1 -9, mannose properdin, factor B There are no specific contraindications or precautions. The usual Schedule vaccines are probably eff ective. Influenza, Hib, pneumococcal (PCV13 and 23PPV) and meningococcal vaccines are recommended. deficiencies Chronic granulomatous disease and cyclic neutropenia MMR, VV, ZV) can be administered. The usual Schedule vaccines are probably effective. Influenza vaccine is recommended. Leukocyte adhesion defect, myeloperoxidase deciency All live vaccines Hib, pneumococcal (PCV13 and 23PPV) and HANDBOOK 2020 4.3.4 Secondary (acquired) immunodeciency Secondary immunodeficiencies are acquired. They occur in individuals with HIV, individuals with malignant neoplasms, solid -organ transplan t recipients, and in individuals receiving cancer chemotherapy or other immunotherapies.29 The ability of individuals with a secondary immunodeficiency to develop an adequate immunological response depends on the disease and/or the type and intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. After immunosuppressive therapy is discontinued, immune recovery can take weeks to years. Ideally, vaccination should be conducted prior to any planned immunosuppression. Vaccines for individuals with acquired immunodeficiency In diseases such as HIV or chronic renal failure, where immune impairment is likely to be progressive, ensuring the individual is up to date with Schedule and additional funded vaccines earlier in their disease process may result in better antibody response s. Before commencing a therapy that would be expected to cause significant immunosuppression, a full vaccination history should be obtained. Then, if circumstances permit, such as prior to commencing immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatological disease o r prior to solid organ transplant, vaccination should be completed following the usual Schedule (including HPV from age 9 years). Administration of additional funded vaccines (eg, varicella for children, zoster for certain adults, meningococcal or pneumoco ccal vaccines) may be appropriate. However, when immediate commencement of therapy is clinically indicated, it is not recommended to delay therapy to allow for vaccination. Live vaccines - caution Live vaccines (BCG, rotavirus, MMR and VV) are contraindic ated for individuals who are immunosuppressed because of the risk of disseminated vaccine disease. Individuals who are not considered to be significantly immunodeficient or immunosuppressed can receive live vaccines. For individuals who are due to commence elective immunosuppressive therapy, live vaccines (MMR, VV, ZV) should be administered at least four weeks prior to commencement of therapy. Live vaccines should also be administered at least four weeks before a predicted transplant. On a case -by-case basis with appropriate follow -up in place, a specialist may recommend that VV is administered less th an four weeks before a predicted transplant or to a post -transplantation paediatric patient.33 See sections 12.5, 22.5 and 23.5 for information about the recommended MMR, VV and ZV vaccination schedules a nd eligibility criteria. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 105 Influenza vaccine Influenza vaccine is funded for all immunodeficient and immunosuppressed individuals aged 6 months or older. Regardless of their age, all immunocompromised individuals who receive influenza vaccine for the first time are recommended to receive two vaccine doses at least four weeks apart (second dose unfunded), and one funded dose annually after that. A second dose is funded for children aged 6 months to under 9 years when influenza vaccine is being used for the fi rst time. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib -PRP) vaccines Infants and children aged under 5 years Vaccination against Hib disease for infants and children aged under 5 years is included in the usual Schedule. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine is recommended at 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months of age followed by a booster dose of Hib -PRP vaccine) at age 15 months. Children aged 5 years or older and adults Children aged 5 years or older and adults who have functional asplenia, or are pre- /post -solid organ transplantation, pre -/post -splenectomy, post -chemotherapy, receiving immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days, or on renal dialysis, are recommend ed and funded to receive one dose of monovalent Hib -PRP vaccine. Children and adults post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation A three -dose series of Hib -PRP is recommended f or children and adults who are post- haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Children aged under 10 years who are revaccinated using DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib will receive three doses of Hib -PRP-containing vaccine. For children aged 10 years or older and adults who receive monovalent Hib -PRP, one dose is funded, and the immunisation bene fit can be claimed for vaccine administration. Doses two and three are not funded. Hib -PRP can only be ordered from ProPharma and an immunisation benefit cannot be claimed for vaccine administration. Pneumococcal vaccines Infants and children aged under 5 years Children in this age group who have functional asplenia, HIV, nephrotic syndrome or renal failure, or are pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, pre -/post -splenectomy, post-haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or have been receiving high -dose corticosteroid therapy for more than two weeks, other immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days, or radiotherapy are recommended and funded to receive pneumococcal vaccination as part of the extended immunisation programme for high risk groups (see section 16.5.2 ). Administration of PCV13 vaccine at 6 weeks, 3, 5 and 12 months replaces PCV10 vaccine on the Schedule (see sections 16.5.2 and 16.5.3 ) once the eligible condition has been identified followed by age -appropriate 23PPV vaccinations. 106 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Children aged 5 years to under 18 years Children in this age group who have a condition listed in the Infants and children aged under 5 years section above are recommended and funded to receive one PCV13 followed by up to two doses of 23PPV (see section 16.5.2 ). Children aged 5 years or older and adults Children in this age group and adults who have an acquired complement deficiency, functional asplenia or HIV, or are pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, pre -/post - splenectomy, post -chemotherapy, post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or on renal di alysis, are recommended and funded to receive one PCV13 followed by age - appropriate 23PPV vaccinations (see section 16.5.2 ). It is recommended that individuals in this age group who will be or have been receiving high -dose corticosteroid therapy for more than two weeks or other immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days receive pneumococcal vaccination (this is not funded). Meningococcal conju gate vaccines The current funded meningococcal vaccines are and vaccines in section 4.3.3 for an explanation of the timing of MenACWY -D and PCV13 in children. Infants aged under 9 months Infants aged under 9 months who have an acquired complement deficiency, functional asplenia or HIV, or are pre -/post -splenectomy, pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, or post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or pre/post immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenC a minimum of eight weeks apart. For broader meningococcal group coverage in infants aged 6 weeks to 9 months, MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) is also available but not funded (see section 13.5). Infants and children aged 9 -23 months Infants and children in this age group who have an acquired complement deficiency, functional asplenia or HIV, or are pre -/post -splenectomy or pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, a re recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least three months apart, followed by a booster dose after three years then five-yearly. Infants and children in this age group who are post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or will be or have been receiving immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least three months apart. Booster doses of MenACWY -D after three years and then five-yearly are recommended (although not funded) if immunosuppression is long -term. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 107 Children aged 2 years to under 8 years Children in this age group who have an acquired complement deficiency, functional asplenia, HIV, or are pre -/post -splenectomy or pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart, followed by a booster dose after three years then five-yearly. Children in this age group who are post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart. If immunosuppression is long -term, booster doses of MenACWY -D after three years and then five-yearly are recommended (although not funded). Children aged 9 years or older and adults Children in this age group and adults who have an acquired complement deficiency, functional asplenia, HIV, or are pre -/post -splenectomy or pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart, followed by a booster dose every five years. Children in this age group and adults who are post -haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or will be or have been receiving immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days are recommended and funded to receive two doses of MenACWY -D at least eight weeks apart. If immunosuppression is long -term, a booster dose of MenACWY -D is reco mmended (but not funded) every five years. Group B meningococcal vaccine (4CMenB) Vaccination with 4CMenB (Bexsero), to protect against disease caused by the group B meningococcal serotype, is recommended (but not funded) for infants, children and adults who have an acquired com plement deficiency, functional asplenia or HIV, or are pre-/post -splenectomy or pre -/post -solid organ transplantation, or post - haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or prior to planned or following immunosuppressive therapy for longer than 28 days. See Table 13.4 for the recommended schedule. Measles or chickenpox exposure post -transplantation Specialist advice should be sought if an individual who is immunosuppressed is a suspected or confirmed contact of a measles or chickenpox case. Post -transplantation, the use of passive immunisation with IG after exposure to measles or chickenpox should be based on the documentation of negative antibody titres, or where immune status is unknown. See Human normal immunoglobulin prophylaxis for contacts and Prophylaxis with Individuals receiving corticosteroids Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and generally suppress the immune system. The minimum amount of corticosteroid administration sufcient to cause immunosuppression is not well dened, and is dependent on the treatment used, dose, route of administration and duration. A daily dosage equivalent to 2 mg/kg oral prednisone or greater, or a total daily dosage of 20 mg or greater, particularly when given for 14 days or more, is considered sufcient to raise concern about the safety of live vaccines. Individual s receiving fludrocortisone or long -term dexamethasone should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for three months after discontinuation. A single dose of dexamethasone for management of an acute respiratory illness in children is not associate d with a decrease in endogenous corticosteroid levels34 or immunosuppression. No minimum interval is required between administration of a single dose of dexamethasone and a live vaccine, as long the individual is not acutely unwell. Rotavirus vaccine can be given to preterm infants born who are receiving corticosteroids. Live vaccines can be administered to individuals who: are using topical corticosteroid therapy, including on the skin or respiratory tract (by aerosol), or receiving local intra -articular, bursal or tendon corticosteroid injections because such therapies do not usually result in immunosuppression are receiving maintenance physiological doses of corticosteroids are receiving oral budesonide or fluticasone to treat an inflammatory bowel condition receiv ed a single dose of dexamethasone for management of an acute respiratory illness are receiving low to moderate doses of systemic steroids given daily or on alternate days are receiving high -dose corticosteroids for fewer than 14 days. Live vaccines should not be administered to individuals: receiving high dose corticosteroids daily or on alternate days for more than 14 days receiving long -term dexamethasone or hydrocortisone that is not for physiological maintenance or fludrocortisone who have a disease process that causes immunosuppression, except in special circumstances after discussion with the individual 's specialist. See Table 4.1 for guidelin es according to each corticosteroid agent.

The treatment relies on administration of biologic agents that selectively target components of the immune system (eg, antibodies, cytokines and proteins) to alter an individual 's immune response to treat disease.36 In IMID, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, biologic agents target a specific part of the individual 's immune response against 'self' to stop the immune response creating inflammation and damage.36 However, they also affect the immune response against genuine antige ns and cause immunosuppression. Use of a combination of therapies may have a cumulative effect that increases the level of immunosuppression in an individual. In atopic conditions and inflammation such as chronic spontaneous urticaria and allergic asthma, biologic agents inhibit the activation of allergen specific IgE antibodies and mast cells or decrease the number of eosinophils that contribute to allergy related inflammation.36 These treatments do not cause immunosuppression. Other biologic agents stimulate an individual 's immune response by blocking immune checkpoints on healthy cells and cancer cells to increase their anti -tumour response, see section 4.3.2. Live vaccines can be administered to individuals: receiving methotrexate receiving intra -ocular biologic therapy because such therapy does not usually result in immunosuppression taking omalizumab or mepolizumab to manage allergic conditions such as ch ronic spontaneous urticaria and allergic asthma . Live vaccines should not be administered to individuals: with high -level immunosuppression regimens of azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine or methotrexate dose of cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus receiving treatment antibody inhibitors, TNF inhibitors and kinase inhibitors . See Table 4.2 for guidelines according to each biologic agent.

Infants of mothers who received immunosuppressive biologic agents during pregnancy In recent years there has been rapid development of targeted immunosuppressive biologic agents, and an increasing number of pregnant women are receiving such therapies. Common examples include adalimumab, infliximab and rituximab. Studies of the effects of these agents on the infant 's immune system and ability to respond to vaccination are limited.37 Multiple factors influence the potential for these agents to be detected and/or cause immunosuppression in an infant for months after they are born. These include, the agent or combination of agents used, gestational age(s) when administered, ability of the agent(s) and/or their metabolites to cross the placenta, and time between administration of the last antenatal dose and the chronological age of the infa nt.38 For infants aged under 12 months, p lease discuss immunosuppressive therapies taken during pregnancy with infant 's mother or specialist, or contact IMAC (on 0800 IMMUNE /0800 466 863) before or VV vaccines. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 113 Rotavirus vaccine There is limited data on rotavirus vaccination safety when given to infants born to mothers receiving immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy.18, 37, 39 Although in most cases it is likely to be safe, caution is required. T he level of circulating wild -type rotavirus is currently very low in New Zealand, therefore, the risk of gastroenteritis following rotavirus vaccination in this cohort of infants may be greater than the risk of acquiring the disease. The decision to admini ster rotavirus vaccine to infants born to mothers who received immunosuppressive agents (biologic agents) during pregnancy should be determined case by case. If an infant turns 15 weeks of age before the first rotavirus vaccine dose can be administered, t hey will not be able to receive any rotavirus vaccine doses. BCG, MMR and VV Infants born to mothers who received immunosuppressive agents during pregnancy must not be vaccinated with a BCG vaccine until they are identified as being immunocompetent. Norm ally, it is only recommended to give MMR and VV before age 12 months if there is an increased risk of exposure, such as during an outbreak or following close contact with a case (see sections 12.5.1 , 12.8 and 22.8.3 ). Infants aged under 12 months born to mothers who received immunosuppressive agents during pregnancy should not be vaccinated with MMR or VV unless they are identified as being immunocompetent. 4.3.7 (Re)vaccination following immunosu ppression All vaccines on the Schedule are funded for vaccination or re -vaccination of individuals following immunosuppression. Note that the period of immunosuppression due to steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy must be longer than 28 days. The timing and number of doses should be discussed with the individual 's specialist. Ideally, vaccination should be conducted prior to any planned immunosuppression. See also the relevant disease chapters. 4.3.8 Oncology This section provides general guidelines for vaccination during and after cancer treatment. Specific vaccination questions should be discussed with an expert paediatrician, infectious diseases physician or oncologist. Note: The exception to these guidelines is individuals being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for whom vaccination may be contraindicated (see section 4.3.2). 114 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vaccination during cancer chemotherapy While administration of inactivated and subunit (non -live) vaccines is safe for individuals undergoing cancer chemotherapy (except immune checkpoint inhibitors as described in the previous section ), their response and subsequent protection may be reduced compared with healthy individuals. Influenza vaccination is recommended for children and adults prior to planned or when undergoing cancer chemotherapy as soon as the vaccine becomes available; th ere is no need to wait until three months after the individual 's last treatment.40, 41 Influenza vaccination can be administered at any time during a cancer chemotherapy cycle.42 In both chil dren and adults, administration of two influenza vaccine doses a minimum of four weeks apart could improve the immune response to vaccination.43 Administration of live vaccines during cancer chemotherapy is absolutely contraindicated because of the risk of disseminated vaccine disease. For recommendations regarding vaccina tion of close contacts of immunocompromised individuals, see section 4.3.1. Vaccination after cancer chemotherapy In general, booster dose(s) of a diphtheria/tetanu s/pertussis -containing vaccine, and hepatitis B, polio (IPV) and pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13 followed by 23PPV) should be given, from not less than three months after cancer chemotherapy has ended (except immune checkpoint inhibitors as described in secti on 4.3.2, when the lymphocyte count is >1.0 \u00d7 109/L). In general, administration of age -appropriate live vaccines should be delayed for at least six months after cancer chemotherapy. This interval may need to be extended according to: the intensity and type of therapy receipt of blood products or IG (see Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 ) underlying disease. MMR vaccination is not required post -chemotherapy for adults born prior to 1969 or who have documented evidence of measles, mumps and rubella immunity (see section 12.8.3 ). Adults born in 1969 or later who do not have documented evidence of immunity to measles, mumps and rubella should receive up to two docu mented doses of MMR, as per the usual adu lt catch -up Schedule, at least six months post - chemotherapy and when their lymphocyte count is >1.0 x 109/L. For children aged under 18 years, see the Starship Clinical Guideline Immunisation of children during and after cancer therapy for age -appropriate schedules and worksheets (available IMAC factsheet Immunisation for adults post -chemotherapy who are not taking immunosuppressive disease mo difying drugs (available at www.immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). Vaccination and radiotherapy Individuals who are only receiving localised radiotherapy to treat a tumour or le sion can be vaccinated with subunit vaccines and live vaccines at any time prior to, during, or after radiotherapy.44 4.3.9 Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used to treat haematological disease, such as acute leukaemia, and some immunodeficiency syndromes, such as severe combined immunodeficiency. Transplant recipients undergo a conditioning regime to destroy their immune system and underlying disease then receive an infusion of cells to reconstitute a new immune system. The transplanted cells may be collected from bone marrow, umb ilical cord blood, or peripheral blood. They may be donated by another person (called an allogeneic transplant), or may be the recipient 's own cells that have been processed to ensure they are disease free (called an autologous transplant).45 After HSCT, it takes months to years for the recipient 's new immune system t o reconstitute and become functional. However, the age of the recipient, underlying disease, conditioning regime, type of transplantation and complications such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) can affect and prolong recovery time.45, 46 Vaccination of individuals post -HSCT Initially, the recipient may have temporary measurable donor -derived protection against some diseases, but their reconstituted immune system will need full (re)vaccination to provide long -term protection against vaccine -preventable diseases. Administration of subunit vaccines, such as PCV13, may be recommended as early as three months post -HSCT. Annual influenza vaccination may be recommended from six months post -HSCT. It is generally recommended to commence immunisation with live viral vaccines no less than 24 months post -HSCT and in the absence of GVHD and immunosuppr essive therapy.46, 47 For children aged under 18 years, see the Starship Clinical Guideline Immunisation of children during and after cancer therapy for age -appropriate schedules and worksheets (available at www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/immunisation -of-children -during - and-after -cancer -therapy ). For adults, see the vaccination protocol provided by the person 's New Zealand -based haematology clinic or the IMAC factsheet Immunisation for adults post stem at www.immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). 116 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 For recommendations regarding vaccination of close contacts of immunocompromised individuals, see section 4.3.1. 4.3.10 Solid organ transplant ation Vaccination of individuals pre -/post solid organ transplantation In addition to the usual Schedule vaccines, individuals who are pre -/post -solid organ transplantation are eligible to receive additional funded vaccines. Ideally, vaccination should be conducted prior to any planned immunosuppression.48 An accelerated immunisation schedule is provided for infants with congenital biliary or renal conditions requiring transplant (see Table 4.3). Additional funded vaccines may include hepatitis A vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine if the person was not previously vaccinated or does not have evidence of immunity (see section 9.5.4); Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib -PRP), influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and varicella vaccines. Live vaccines - caution Live vaccines should also be administered at least four weeks before a predicted transplant. Administration o f live vaccines (MMR and VV or ZV) is generally contraindicated post -transplantation due to immunosuppression. However, on a case - by-case basis with appropriate follow -up in place, a specialist may recommend that VV is administered less than four weeks bef ore a predicted transplant or to a post - transplantation paediatric patient.33 See Vaccines for individuals with acquired immunodeficiency in section 4.3.4 for precautions and contraindications for the administration of live vaccines (MMR and VV or ZV), eligibility and recommendations for influenza, Hib, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines, a nd recommendations when an individual who is immunosuppressed/post -solid organ transplantation is a contact of a measles or chickenpox case.

There are three main reasons why an individual may not have a fully functioning spleen: congenital disorders (eg, asplenia, hyposplenia (eg, Coeliac disease, leukaemia) surgical removal (eg, trauma, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia) . Individuals with reduced spleen function or an absent s pleen are at increased risk of overwhelming infection by encapsulated bacteria.49 This is a medical emergency and carries a high mortality rate. The risk of overwhelming infection after splenectomy is more than 50 times higher than the risk in the general population. Opinion is divided on whether this level of risk is life -long or decreases over time after the splenectomy. Vaccination of individuals with asplenia or hyposplenia or pre - /post -splenectomy No vaccines are contraindicated for individuals with functional or anatomical asplenia (pre-/post -splenectomy), and they a re eligible for additional funded influenza, Hib, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. Providers should also ensure that they are up to date with Schedule vaccines, including Tdap and MMR. 120 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 When a splenectomy is planned, individuals should ideally comp lete the vaccinations they require up to two weeks prior to their surgery. If this is not possible, preferably administer vaccines until 14 days before the splenectomy and continue from seven days after the splenectomy, or prior to discharge from hospital, if sooner . When the splenectomy is unexpected, for example due to trauma, commence vaccination from seven days after surgery or prior to discharge from hospital. In all cases a vaccination plan must be formulated and communicated to the GP for completion (see Table 4.4). Individuals with reduced spleen function (eg, because of disease or partial splenectomy), are recommended (but not funded) to receive pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines and annual infl uenza vaccination. See Vaccines for individuals with acquired immunodeficiency in section 4.3.4 for eligibility and recommendations for influenza, H ib, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines.

The efcacy of any vaccine may be reduced in HIV -positive individuals, and antibody levels within these individuals may wane faster than in individuals who are HIV-negative. Although antiretroviral therapy may improve immune responses, it is unlikely these individuals will achieve the levels of antibodies seen in individuals who are HIV -negat ive. Serological testing and the need for additional doses (eg, HepB: see section 9.5.7 and Table 9.6) should be discussed with the individual 's specialist.

However, the immune system response to vaccina tion decreases with advancing kidney disease.51, 52 Cases of children developi ng a disease for which they have serological evidence of immunity have been reported.52 Individuals with nephrotic syndrome, kidney failure or end -stage kidney disease (CKD stages 4-5) have an increased risk of peritonitis and/or sepsis caused by encapsulated bacteria, .51, 52, 53 Individuals on haemodialysis have an increased risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus. Adults with CKD also have an increased risk of zoster.54 Vaccination of individuals with chronic kidney disease Individuals with CKD who are not receiving immunosuppressive therapy to manage their condition can receive vaccination as per the usual Immunisation Schedule. In addition to the usual Immunisation Schedule vaccines, individuals with CKD may be eligible to receive additional funded vaccines. These should be given as soon as the individual meets the eligibility criteria (eg, CKD stages 4 -5: pre -dialysis, on dialysis, pre-kidney transplant, post -kidney transplant). Additional funded vac cines may include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), pneumococcal, and meningococcal vaccines. Individuals with CKD are also eligible to receive funded influenza vaccination. Live vaccines - caution Administration of live vacci nes (MMR and VV or ZV) are generally contraindicated for individuals who are immunosuppressed because of the risk of disseminated vaccine disease. However, individuals with CKD who are considered to have minimal immunosuppression may be able to receive VV.35 See Vaccines for individuals with acquired immunodeficiency in section 4.3.4 for eligibility and recommendations for influenza, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. There is no relationship between vaccination and deterioration of renal function or a reduction in the efficacy of dialysis.52 For children aged under 18 years, see the Starship Clinical Guideline Renal vaccination record for the IMAC factsheet Immunisation for adults pre -dialys is, on dialysis pre -/post -kidney transplant (available at www.immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). 4.5 Chronic liver disease Chronic liver disease in infants and children may prese nt as part of a congenital syndrome. They may have other conditions (eg, infants with biliary atresia may also have a non -functioning spleen) and eligibility for additional funded vaccines. 4.5.1 Vaccination of individuals with chronic liver disease Individuals with chronic liver disease who are not receiving immunosuppressive therapy to manage their condition can receive vaccination as per the usual Schedule. In addition to the usual Schedule vaccines, infants and children with chronic liver disease are eligib le to receive funded hepatitis A vaccination from 12 months of age (see section 8.5.1). However, if they are likely to require a liver transplant an accelerated vaccination schedule may be advised as per Table 4.3. The aim of the accelerated schedule is to maximise protection against vaccine -preventable diseases and to deliver live vaccines prior to transplantation and immunosuppression. Prior to transplantation, hepatitis A vaccine could be administered from as early as 7 months of age. Additional pre-transplantation funded vaccines include influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, and varicella vaccines (see section 4.3.1). It is recommended that adults with chronic liver disease receive influenza vaccination annually but this is not currently funded. Adults who are likely to require a liver transplant are eligible for additional funded vaccines, including hepatitis A vaccine ; hepatitis B vaccine, if the individual was not previously vaccinated or does not have evidence of immunity; Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal and varicella vaccines (see section 4.3.10 ). 4.6 Other special groups It is recommended that all individuals receive vaccination as per the usual Schedule except when pre -vaccination screening identifies a contraindication for a specific vaccine (see section 2.1.4). Additional vaccines may be recommended (but are not always funded) for individuals with some conditions or in some circumstances not IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 129 previously discussed in this chapter.

T he programme may require modification based on documented doses: only clearly documented doses should be considered as given. If there is no documented vaccination history, plan the catch -up schedule assuming the vaccines have not been given, see Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 131 Immunisation schedules vary from country to country. Check all migrant and former refugee children immunisation records to ensure they ar e up to date with the New Zealand Schedule, in particularly ensure they have received MMR as opposed to a measles -rubella vaccine only. For assistance with planning catch -up schedules, contact your local immunisation coordinator; or call IMAC on 0800 IMMU NE/0800 466 863, or discuss with an experienced colleague. All children aged under 18 years are eligible to receive Schedule vaccines and Well Child Tamariki Ora services regardless of their immigration and citizenship status, and providers can claim the immunisation benefit for administering the vaccines. Adult refugees aged 18 years or older are eligible to receive Schedule vaccines, and providers can claim the immunisation benefit for administering the vaccines. Non-residents who were aged under 18 yea rs when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the course, even if they are aged 18 years or older when they complete it. Other adults aged 18 years or older must meet all the applicable eligibility criteria described in the Health and Disability Services Eligibility Direction 2011 to receive funded healthcare services, including Schedule vaccines. For more information about eligibility for publicly funded services, see the Ministry of Health website ( www.health.govt.nz/eligibility ). See also the Recommendations for Comprehensive Post -Arrival Health Assessment for People from Refugee -like Backgrounds (2016 edition) , available on the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases we bsite ( www.asid.net.au/resources/clinical - guidelines ).

For further details, see section 21.5.2 and the Ministry of Health Guidelines for Tuberculosis Control in New Zealand, 2019 (available at www.health.govt.nz/pu blication/guidelines - tuberculosis -control -new-zealand -2019 ). Quota refugees are screened for active TB prior to arrival in New Zealand. If they are found to have active TB, their arrival is delayed until they are treated. The requirement for active TB scr eening of visitors and immigrants to New Zealand varies, dependent on the country they are coming from and/or how long they intend to stay in New Zealand.55 In New Zealand over 2010 -2016, the highest number of new TB cases were in people born overseas followed by people living with a person born overseas. Over 2012 -2016, the average time between arrival in New Zealand and a new diagnosis of TB was around five years.56 See section 21.3.2 for risk fac tors and Appendix 8 Table A8.1 for a countries with high incidence of TB. Medical practitioners and laboratories are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health of suspected or confirmed cases of active TB. A person who has, or is suspected 132 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 to have, active TB is entitled to the same level of funded health services as New Zealand citizens can expect.55 Hepatitis B If a member of a refugee or immigrant family i s found to be a hepatitis B carrier, it is recommended that all the family be screened, and vaccination offered to all those who are non -immune. Even if no one in the family is a hepatitis B carrier, it is recommended that all children aged under 18 years be vaccinated against hepatitis B. See chapter 9 for more information and Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules. Varicella Individuals who have grown up in the tropics are less likely to have had chickenpox in childhood and may be non -immune as adolescents and adults. Adult chickenpox can be severe, and maternal varicella occurring in the first half of pregnancy can cause the rare but devastating congenital varicella syndrome (see Table 22.4). If there is no history of chickenpox, VV should be offered (although it is currently not funded). 4.8 Occupation -related vaccination Certain occupations result in increased risk of contracting some vaccine -preventable diseases. Some infected workers, particularly health care workers and those working in early childhood education services, may transmit inf ections such as influenza, rubella, measles, mumps, varicella and pertussis to susceptible contacts, with the potential for serious outcomes. Where workers are at significant occupational risk of acquiring a vaccine -preventable disease, the employer shoul d implement a comprehensive occupational vaccination programme, including vaccination policies, staff vaccination records, information about the relevant vaccine -preventable diseases and the management of vaccine refusal. Employers should take all reasonab le steps to encourage susceptible workers to be immunised. For information on what is required as evidence of immunity against vaccine preventable diseases, see the IMAC factsheet Occupation related immunisation (available at www.immune.org.nz/resources/written -resources ). The vaccines in Table 4.8 are recommended for certai n occupational groups. In addition to the vaccines listed here, all adults should be up to date with age - appropriate Schedule vaccines (see section A2.3 in Appendix 2 for catch -up vaccination advice for adults aged 18 years or older). If a non -immune individual is exposed to a vaccine -preventabl e disease, post -exposure prophylaxis and control measures should be administered where indicated (see the relevant disease chapters and the Communicable Disease Control Manual, available at health.govt.nz/publication/communicable IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 133 Table 4.8: Recommended vaccines, by occupational group Occupation Recommended vaccines Health care workers Medical staff, nursing staff, lead maternity carers, other health professional staff and students Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis A (if working with children) Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Carers Health care assistants, long -term facility carers and nursing home staff Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis A (if exposed to faeces) Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Individuals who work with children Early childhood education services staff Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Other individuals working with children, including: correctional staff working where infants/children live with mothers school teachers (including student teachers) outside school hours carers child counselling services workers youth services workers Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Influenza, annually Continued overleaf 134 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Occupation Recommended vaccines Emergency and essential service workers Police and emergency workers Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Armed forces personnel Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis A (if deployed to high -risk countries) Hepatitis B Influenza, annually MenACWY (if living in close quarters and/or deployed to high -risk countries) 4CMenB (if living in close quarters) Yellow fever, rabies, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis (as appropriate, if depl oyed to high-risk countries) Staff of correctional facilities Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Staff of immigration/refugee centres Tdap - at least every 10 years IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis B Influenza, annually Continued overleaf IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 135 Occupation Recommended vaccines Individuals who work with animals Veterinarians, veterinary students and veterinary nurses Tdap IPV MMR Influenza, annually Zoo staff who work with primates Tdap IPV MMR Hepatitis A Influenza, annually Poultry workers and others handling poultry, including those who may be involved in culling during an outbreak of avian influenza, and swine industry workers Tdap IPV MMR Influenza, annually Individuals exposed to human tissue, blood, body fluids or sewage Laboratory staff Tdap IPV MMR Varicella Hepatitis A (if exposed to faeces) Hepatitis B Influenza, annually MenACWY and 4CMenB (if regularly working with Neisseria meningitidis cultures) Workers who perform skin penetration procedures (eg, tattooists, body -piercers) Tdap IPV MMR Hepatitis B Funeral workers, embalmers and other workers who have regular contact with human tissue, blood or body fluids and/or used needles or syringes Sewage workers, plumbers or other workers in regular contact with untreated sewage Tdap IPV MMR Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Sex workers Tdap IPV MMR Hepatitis B HPV a.

Quarantine and isolation of close contacts and cases until negative PCR result , if a close contact or a case is deemed recovered. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 141 5.1 Virology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV-2) is member of the Coronaviridae family and the Betacoronavirus genus. This enveloped, positive -strand RNA virus encodes four major structural proteins - spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and a helical nucleocapsid (N). To enter host cells, t he spike protein , which forms the characteristic crown -like (Latin: corona ) surface structures , binds to the angiotensin - converting enzyme -2 (ACE2) receptor most frequently found on human respiratory tract e pithelium .1, 2 The precise origin of this virus is unknown. First identified in h umans in Wuhan, China, this virus shares a strong genetic sequence similarity to bat coronaviruses found in China,3 and is a suspected zoonosis from bats via an intermediary animal , such as a pangolin.4 As with most RNA viruses, mutations occur and variant strains of SARS -CoV-2 have been identified . 5.2 Clinical features Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) is caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus, which infects the respiratory tract and is transmitted human to human primarily through respiratory droplets. Documented transmission has also occurred through aerosols, direct contact and fomites (objects or materials that can carry infection) - though the latt er is rare. The reproduction number (R 0) (see section 1.2.1) is estimated to be around 2 -3.5, 6 Transmissibility varies by setting , and recently identified variant strains of SARS -CoV-2 have been at the higher range of the estimated R0 values.7, 8 The symptoms of COVID -19 range widely from asymptomatic or a mild respirat ory tract infection to severe and unusual 'ground glass ' pneumonia, which can lead to severe inflammatory disease and respiratory failure. Classically, COVID -19 presents as respiratory symptoms with new or worsening dry cough, nasal congestion and fever. Unlike other respiratory viral infections, COVID -19 is frequently associated with a loss of taste and smell , and sometimes this is the only symptom. Some cases have reported gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea), muscle aches, headache, 'chills ', breathless ness and confusion. For around 80 percent of cases, COVID -19 is a mild disease, but some develop more severe disease , particularly older adults and those with comorbidities, which can progress to multi -organ and respiratory failure . As for influenza and ot her respiratory viruses, many of those with laboratory -confirmed infection remain asymptomatic. In the early stages, it is difficult to distinguish COVID -19 from other common viral infections and, as of early 2021, the most reliable diagnostic test has been detection of viral mRNA from a nasopharyngeal swab , using PCR assay . Further methods of testing (such as saliva sampling) are under investigation. SARS -CoV-2 serology can help distinguish historic disease from mild current symptoms but is not in routine use. 142 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 The incubation period is typically around four to five days (range 48 hours -14 days). Individuals may be infectious up to three days before becoming s ymptomatic, with infectiousness typically peaking within five days of symptom onset.9 High viral loads are detected in the nose at time of symptom onset.10 Viable virus is not usually detectable for more than 10 days after symptom onset, although SARS -CoV-2 mRNA has been detected for up to 83 days in respiratory and stool samples.9, 11 Unlike previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS), transmission of SARS -CoV-2 can also occur before the onset of symptoms or from asymptomatic individuals.12 Viral loads and infectiousness are highes t immediately after symptom onset , and most transmission occurs in household settings.13, 14 It is currently unclear what pr otection previous infection with SARS -CoV-2 provides, but neutralising antibodies have been detected for at least eight months after primary infection , even without natural boosting as in New Zealand.15 A previous history of SARS -CoV-2 infection was associated with an 83 percent lower risk of infection, with a median time to re -infection of over five months .16 5.2.1 Children and young adults In younger people, particularly infants and children under 10 years old , infection is often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Those aged under 20 years appear to have a lower susceptibility than adults and are much less likely to develop severe infection requiring hospitalisation.17 Current evidence suggests that preschool and young school -age children are much less significant in transmi tting the disease than has been documented for influenza. In contrast, asymptomatic older school -age children, adolescents and young adults are highly effective transmitters of SARS -CoV-2.18 However, t he role children play in transmi tting SARS -CoV-2 is still unclear and could change as new variants evolve. Notably, in household settings, secondary a ttack rates have been found to be higher when the index case has been a child.19 5.2.2 Risk groups Risk factors for severe disease include older age, male, smoking,20 obesity and chronic medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and being immunocompromise d.21 Increased incidence is well documented i n some ethnic groups but seems primarily related to prevalence of the risk factors listed above. Increasing age is the most important risk factor for severe disease, due to declining immune function and high prevalence of comorbidities. The highest rates o f mortality are in the oldest age groups, especially those aged over 80 years ( at a rate 20-fold higher than for those aged 50 -59 years in the U nited Kingdom ).21 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 143 Health care workers Patient -facing health care workers caring for patients with COVID -19 are likely to be exposed to higher viral loa ds, placing them and their household members at greater risk of developing COVID -19 than the general population.22 In Scotland, one -sixth of the COVID -19 cases admitted to hospital were health care workers and their household members.22 Health care workers have also been implicated in the spread of SARS -CoV-2 within health and long -term care facilities.22, 23, 24 However, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other measures aimed at reducing nosocomial viral transmission have been shown to be effective . Where COVID -19 is prevalent in the community, health care workers are more likely to catch COVID -19 from an infected household member.14 Pregnant women Although pregnant wo men are not at increased risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection, they are at increased risk of severe disease and death compared with age -matched non -pregnant women.25, 26 While the absolute risk of severe outcomes among pregnant women is low compared with absolute risk due to advanced age, the rate of ICU care for COVID -19 has been found to be over three -fold higher for pregnant women than for non -pregnant women, and the case -fatality rate in one United States study was 13.6 -fold higher for pregnant women.26 Obesity, hypertension, asthma, autoimmune disease, diabetes and older age are also associated with severe COVID -19 in pregnant women. Infants of mothers with COVID -19 are at increased risk of p reterm birth and neonatal ICU admission.27 Early studies do not suggest intraute rine transmission , but vertical transmission has been shown in around 3 percent of neonates, predominantly from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mothers .28 5.2.3 Post-infection complications Longer lasting effects of infection have been reported , described as 'long-COVID '. Long -COVID appears to affect around 10 percent of those infected, particularly those with at least five symptoms in the first week of illness.29, 30, 31 Post-acute manifestations include cardiovascular, pulmonary and neurological effects, including chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, specific organ dysfunction and depression.32 Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PIMS -TS) has been temporally and rarely associated with largely asympto matic SARS -CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents.33, 34 5.2.4 SARS -CoV-2 variants As with all viruses, new variants have evolved. Most recently, certain variants have been shown to bind the ACE2 receptor more readily , making the variants more transmissible. It is unclear whether these variants result in more cases of severe disease , but irrespective, the greater numbers of people becoming infect ed is increas ing the burden of the disease.7, 8 144 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5.3 Epidemiology 5.3.1 Global burden of disease Clusters of distinctive pneumonia cases were observed in Wuhan, China during December 2019. The cause was identified in January 2020 as a novel coronavirus that had genetic and clinical similarity to the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syn drome (SARS) epidemic from 2002 to 2004. Consequently, the novel corona virus was named SARS -CoV-2 and the associated disease named Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19). Due to the rapid spread , a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was announced in late January 2020. By the time the COVID -19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on 11 March 2020, there were 118,000 reported COVID -19 cases and 4 ,291 associated deaths in 114 countries. The global death toll surpassed 1 million by late September 2020. By the end of January 2021, over 2.2 million deaths and over 100 million confirmed cases were reported to the WHO, with around 4 million new cases in a week. The Americas and Europe had the highest numbers of recorded ca ses (44.2 million in the Americas and 33.5 million in Europe, with the Western Pacific experiencing 1.38 million). See the WHO Coronavirus Disease ( COVID -19) Dashboard for the latest official data. Actual rates are expected to be considerably higher than officially reported rates. The infection -fatality rate, while still high particularly in the older age groups, has reduced since the start of the pandemic, with improved clinic al recognition and management and the use of therapies of demonstrated value, such as dexamethasone (see Figure 5.1.).35, 36 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 145 Figure 5.1: Total confirmed COVID -19 deaths and cases per million people, World (as of 14 February 2021) Note: The confirmed counts shown here are lower than the total counts. The main reason for this is limited testing and challenges in the attribution of the cause of deat h. Sources: Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Johns Hopkins University of Medicine ; Our World in Data The use of vac cines is anticipated to reduce the global burden of COVID -19 significantly . The first phase I clinical trial for a COVID -19 vaccine commenced in March 2020. The first public vaccination dose was given as part of a mass campaign in the United Kingdom on 8 D ecember 2020. By 31 January 2021, almost 100 million COVID -19 vaccinations had been given worldwide. See the Our World in Data website for the latest figures. 5.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology As of 31 January 2021, New Zealand had 2,303 cases and 25 deaths associated with COVID -19 notified since 24 February 2020. Most cases were observed in those aged 20-34 years (803 cases, 34.9%), 35 -49 years (499; 21.7%) and 50 -64 years (456, 19.8%). This reflects the age groups most likely to be travelling to New Zealand and the proportion of cases arriving at the border being detected in managed quarantine facilities. In children, there were 253 cases (11.0%) aged 5 -7 years and 56 cases (2.5%) aged under 4 years. To date, no child under 13 years of age ha s been hospitalised with COVID -19 in New Zealand. 146 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Currently, m ost of the cases occur in managed facilities. As of 1 February 2021, 50 percent of total confirmed cases had been imported, 21 percent were related to an imported case and 25 percent were locally acquired from a known case (see Figure 5.2). According to the Ministry of Health, out of 1,535,292 tests conducted from 22 January 2020 (the date of the first test in New Zealand) to 1 February 2021, 1907 tests in the community and 721 tests in managed facilities were posi tive for SARS -CoV-2. Figure 5.2: Daily confirmed COVID -19 cases by source, 26 February 2020 to 16 February 2021 Source: ESR For the current case status, see the NZ COVID -19 Dashboard produced by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research ( ESR), and for further information about current sources of cases, see the Ministry of Health COVID -19 website. Strategy for prevention The first case of COVID -19 was reported in New Zealand on 28 February 2020. During March, cases numbers increased , and clusters of transmission were identified. Border restrictions were implemented on 16 March 2020. On 25 March 2020, New Zealand entered a nationwide lockdown ( alert level 4). New Zealand implemented an elimination strategy with four defined levels of pandemic response to prevent the spread of SAR-CoV-2. A mobile phone app aided rapid contact tracing. For further information about the country's alert system levels, see the United against COVID -19 website. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 147 These strategies were effective in containing the spread of SARS -CoV-2 in New Zealand (see case curve for 24 February to 8 June 2020 at NZ COVID -19 Dashboard for details . These restrictions were able to rapidly stop the spread of the virus within the country. Only 19 percent of the introductions of virus resulted in ongoing transmission or more than one additional case.5 5.4 Vaccines 5.4.1 Introduction Clinical trials for COVID -19 vaccine candidates began shortly after the pandemic was announced in March 2020. The New Zealand Government signed advanced purchase agreements for four vaccine candidates, with purchase dependent on approval for use from the N ew Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority ( Medsafe ). This is an ongoing process and , therefore, the availability and eligibility for these different vaccines may change. 5.4.2 Available vaccines Vaccines for COVID -19 continue to undergo phase II I clinical trials , and the Medsafe approval process is ongoing for each vaccine candidate . Provisional a pproval was granted on 3 February 2021 for using New Zealand's first COVID -19 vaccine , namely, a mRNA -based COVID -19 vaccine -CV, trade name Comirn manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech . Funded vaccines The mRNA -CV consists acid (mRNA) encoding the full-length spike glycoprotein of the -CoV-2 virus inside a lipid nanoparticle . The spike protein has an adjuvant effect , so n o additional adjuvant is included. It is designated BNT162b2 in clinical trials conducted by Pfizer and BioNTech. 148 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticle. The mRNA is produced using cell -free in vitro transcription from DNA templates. The lipid mRNA -CV contains sucrose to protect the lipid during ultra -low temperature storage. This mRNA vaccine delivers the instructions for human cells to build the viral antigen, SARS -CoV-2 spike protein. The mRNA is temporarily protect ed from degradation by the lipid nanoparticle that also facilitates fusion with the recipient 's cell wall.37, 38 5.4.3 Efficacy and effectiveness mRNA COVID -19 vaccine - Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) Immunogenicity Assessing i mmunogenicity was a key component of the early -phase clinical trials of COVID -19 vaccines before the phase III efficacy studi es were conducted . Virus neutralising antibody responses measured the killing of live SARS -CoV-2 and/or pseudo -virus in cell culture. Since no correlates of protection have yet been established, humoral responses were compared with human convalescent sera collected from patients who had recovered from COVID -19. Two vaccine candidates were evaluated (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) in the initial phase I and II clinical trials. Both demonstrated similar dose -dependent neutralising antibody titres, which were similar or higher to the titres in convalescent sera .39, 40 Anti-receptor binding domain (anti -RBD) IgG an tibodies also increased with dose.41 As seen for other vaccines, the antibody response was lower in older people (age d 55-85 years) than in younger people (age d 18-55 years), but both groups had highe r average neutralising antibody levels than those with prior SARS -CoV-2 infection. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 149 Efficacy - clinical trial data Efficacy of mRNA -CV (BNT162b2) was assessed in the phase III component of a large clinical trial in which 43,448 participants aged 16 -85 year s in Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Turkey, South Africa and the U nited States were randomised to receive vaccine or saline placebo.42 Two doses were given 21 days apart. According to interim data, vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID -19 was 94.8 percent (95% CI: 89.8 -97.6%); eight cases in the vaccinated group and 162 cases in control group developed COVID -19 at least seven days after dose two. Evidence of previous SARS -CoV-2 infection did not alter this efficacy (VE 95 .0% without and 94.6% includ ing those with previous infection). Similar efficacy (90 -100 percent ) was observed across all subgroups as defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body -mass index (35% of participants were obese, BMI 30) and the presence of at least one co -existin g medical conditions (in 21 %). Moderate e arly protection against COVID -19 was observed before the second dose.42 This clinical trial is ongoing , and further data is anticipated as predefined endpoints are reached. The trial is due to be completed in January 2023. Efficacy against transmission Efficacy of mRNA -CV against transmission of SARS -CoV-2 is unclear. It is expected that, at the least, with fewer symptomatic people coughing and producing large quantities of virus, the spread of the virus will be reduced. Efficacy against ne w virulent SARS -CoV-2 strains Currently there is limited clinical data about the efficacy of mRNA -CV against the new virulent SARS -CoV-2 strains. In vitro study data has shown that sera from vaccine recipients are able to neutralise a pseudo -virus bearing variant spike proteins from the United Kingdom strain but are slightly less effective against the South African strain. It is anticipated that small differences in viral neutralisation are unlikely to lead to significant reduction in v accine effectiveness against the latter variant. Duration of immunity There has been insufficient time since the commencement of clinical trials to assess how long immunity lasts following immunisation or natural infection. It is unknown whether booster v accinations will be required to maintain immunity. 150 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5.4.4 Transport, storage and handling mRNA COVID -19 vaccine - Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) To preserve the integrity of the mRNA in this vaccine, storage at ultra -low temperature freezer (between -90\u00b0C and -60\u00b0C) is required. At these ultra -low temperature s, the shelf -life is six months. The vaccine will be thawed in batches, packed into cartons and distributed from the central warehouse . Each carton will have a label with an updated batch number an d expiry date and time . Expiry reduces from 6 months to 5 days (120 hours) once thawed. Thawed vaccine s will be shipped to vaccination sites as per the standard cold chain, as detailed in the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) available +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C for up to five days (120 hours) or up to two hours at room temperature (up to +30 \u00b0C). After dilution, store vials between +2\u00b0C and +30\u00b0C and use within six hours. Any r emaining vaccine in the vial must be discarded after six hours. Do not refreeze. 5.4.5 Dosage and administration Each dose of mRNA -CV is 0.3 mL (30 \u00b5g) to be administered intramuscularly. Two doses are given at least 21 days apart for individuals age 16 years o r older. Each multi -dose vial contains 0.45 mL of vaccine and should be diluted with 1.8 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Once diluted , each reconstituted vaccine will supply five or six doses of 0.3 mL. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full 0.3 mL dose, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. An observation period following vaccination of at least 20 minutes is recommended (see section 5.6.2). This is to ensure that any anaphylactic -type reactions can receive prompt treatment . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 151 5.5 Recommended immunisation schedule 5.5.1 Recommended and funded The vaccine will only be available according to a priorit isation schedule for defined groups. Individuals from the age of 16 years are recommended to received two doses of given at least 21 days apart. The safety and efficacy of mRNA -CV in children and adolescents aged under 16 years have not yet been established . The vaccine is not currently approved for this age group but is expected to be efficacious and may be deployed in high -risk situations, such as in response to a school -based outbreak of the disease. 5.5.2 Spacing of COVI D-19 vaccination and other vaccines In view of the absence of data on concomitant delivery, and to minimise confusion with any associated reactions, a gap of two weeks is generally recommended between giving mRNA -CV after any other vacc ine. However, based on first principles of how these vaccines work, adverse impacts on immunogenicity or safety are unlikely with a shorter gap, so if it is clinically important to deliver in a shorter time, do not delay. If it is not practicable to keep a two -week gap betwe en vaccines, then do not delay. If a live vaccine has been administered, wait four weeks before giving a COVID -19 vaccine but if not practicable, then do not delay. If a COVID -19 vaccine is administered first, then maintain a two -week gap before any other vaccines. Note: the second mRNA -CV dose is given at least 21 days after the first dose. 5.5.3 Previous history of COVID -19 Vaccination should be offered regardless of an individual's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection. As the duration of protection post infection is currently unknown, vaccination is recommended regardless of history of disease. Viral or serological testing is not required before vaccination. 152 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5.5.4 Previous COVID -19 vaccination Individuals who have had one dose of mRNA -CV should receive a second dose of the same mRNA -CV to complete the vaccination course. There is no data available on the interchangeability between COVID -19 vaccines, and as such, oth er vaccines should not be substituted to complete the course. 5.5.5 Breastfeeding While lactating women were not included in phase III studies, as with all schedule vaccines, there are no safety concerns about giving mRNA -CV to lactating women. 5.5.6 Individuals rec eiving immunosuppressive agents There are no safety concerns around administering mRNA -CV to individuals who are receiving immunosuppressive agents. As with other non -live vaccines, t he antibody response to mRNA -CV may be reduced and protection may be subo ptimal but, it is likely to be adequate to protect agains t severe disease. 5.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines, section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccin es and section 4.3.2 for immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy, particularly for oncology patients. Specialist advice should be sought before administering any vaccine to individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and ipilimumab) or who have discontinued treatment within the past six months (see section 4.3.2). 5.6.1 Contraindications A history of anaphylaxis to any component or previous dose of mRNA -CV is a contraindication. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 153 5.6.2 Precautions A definite history of immediate allergic reaction to any other product is considered as a precaution but not a contraindication to vaccination with mRNA -CV. A slightly increased risk of a severe allergic response in individual s who have had a previous anaphylaxis -type reaction needs to be balanced against the risk of SARS -CoV-2 exposure and severe COVID -19. These individuals can still receive mRNA -CV and observation extended to 30 minutes after vaccination in health care settings , where anaphylaxis can be immediately treated with adrenal ine. Pregnancy Pregnancy is a precaution for mRNA -CV. To date, previous c linical studies have not investigated the mRNA vaccine in pregnancy - a phase II/III clinical trial is underway in the US. Based on how the vaccine works, it is unlikely to pose a sp ecific risk when given to pregnant women . Increased risk of severe COVID -19 disease in pregnancy and adverse fetal outcomes have been documented .26 It is recommended to delay vaccination until after delivery if the pregnant woman is at low risk of exposure, but for those at risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2, vaccination can be offered with informed consent. Routine testing for pregnancy before COVID -19 vaccination is not recommended. Women who are trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after receiving mRNA -CV. 5.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 5.7.1 Potential responses Commonly reported responses to mRNA -CV (during clinical trials and post -licensure) are injection -site pain, headache and fatigue; other responses included muscle aches, feeling generally unwell, chills, fever, joint pain and nausea. These occurred most of ten after dose two and in younger adults (aged 18 -55 years), and within one or two days of vaccination. Most are mild or moderate in severity and are self -limiting.42, 43 Paracetamol can be taken for pain and discomfort following vaccination. 154 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5.7.2 AEFIs Adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) with mRNA -CV are being closely monitored during clinical trials and post marketing survei llance. A list of adverse events of special interest (AESI), including those previously associated with immunisation in general and with particular vaccine platforms, has been created by Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines (SPEAC) in collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI) and based on existing and new Brighton Collaboration case definitions. For further information , see the Brighton Collaboration COVID -19 website. Global pharmacovigilance and active safety monitoring systems continue to watch for both AESI and unexpected AEFI. As of 16 January 2021, no AESI signals had been detected up to 21 days after vaccination by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US, following the administration of 121,000 doses of mRNA -CV (Comirnaty).43 Preliminary phase II/III clinical trial safety data reported lymphadenopathy in 64 (0.3 %) vaccine recipients and six (<0.1 %) placebo recipients (follow -up of up to 14 weeks after second dose of a subset of 18,860 participants who received at least one dose of mRNA -CV). Four vaccine -related adverse events were recorded (namely, should er injury related to vaccine administration, lymphadenopathy local to injection site, paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmia and right leg paraesthesia). No deaths were related to either the vaccine or the placebo.42 During clinical trial follow -up to 1 February 2021, acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell's palsy) was reported by four vaccinated participants and none in the placebo group.44 No safety signal has been detected for this condition as an AESI, and clinical trial s afety monitoring is ongoing. Following approval for use in the US, the VAERS detected 50 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of 9,943,247 doses (five cases per million doses) mRNA -CV (Pfizer/BioNTech) . The median interval to symptom onset was 10 minutes (range <1-150 minutes ), 90 percent occurred within 30 minutes of vaccination .43 All were successfully treated with adrenaline. See section 5.6 for contraindications and precautions. A follow -up, after approximately 2 million doses of mRNA -CV were delivered through long-term residential care facilities to elderly and frail residents in the US found no increase in deaths post vaccination.43 Deaths were to be expected and consistent with the all -cause mortality rate and causes of d eath for these individuals, who have multiple comorbidities, declining health and requir e end-of-life care.43 There are no added safety concerns about the use of this vaccine in the elderly.43, 45 5.8 Public health m easures There is an o ngoing COVID -19 pandemic globally. New Zealand has implemented strict pandemic response control measures to prevent the spread of SARS -CoV-2 in the community. New Zealand has a four -level alert system to stipulate the measures that IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 155 the whole population needs to take (as described on the Unite against COVID -19 website ). All individuals with symptoms of COVID -19 are expected to seek medical advice and be tested for infection. Rapid contract tracing and nasopharyng eal testing continue to be fundamental components of the public health measures. Immunisation using COVID -19 vaccines is part of the public health strategy aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in the community to below an R 0 of 1 and t o reduce the severity of disease and minimise the burden on the health care system in the event of a community outbreak. The initial phases of the vaccination programme are aimed at protecting those at risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 at the border or in hea lth care facilities and to prevent the spread of the virus into the community. Further immunisation measures are likely to be implemented as other vaccines become available. 5.8.1 Post-exposure prophylaxis and outbreak control Currently, there is no informatio n on the use of mRNA -CV for post -exposure prophylaxis or outbreak control. 5.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet None applicable.

Immunised cases have been shown to have less severe disease To prevent major community outbreaks at least 70 percent of the childhood population must be immune to diphtheria Public health measures All cases of diphtheria must be notied immediately on suspicion (see section 6.8). 160 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 6.1 Bacteriology Diphtheria is a serious, often fatal, toxin -mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae , a non -sporulating, non -encapsulated, gram -positive bacillus. Rarely, it may also be caused by other toxin -carrying Corynebacteria species, such as Corynebac terium ulcerans . Both toxigenic and non -toxigenic strains can occur during outbreaks, during which non -toxigenic strains can convert to toxigenic strains by infection with tox-gene containing -corynebacteriophage.1 6.2 Clinical features Classic diphtheria characteristically involves membranous inflammation of the upper respiratory tract with in volvement of other tissues, especially the myocardium and peripheral nerves. The organism itself is rarely invasive, but a potent exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, is produced by some toxigenic strains that causes tissue damage through local and systemic actions . There is also a cutaneous form of diphtheria, which is typically less severe. The detection of either C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans is notifiable to the medical officer of health, and the isolates should be referred to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) for toxin detection. Non -toxigenic diphtheria strains can circulate but these do not secrete diphtheria toxin and are not associated with disease nor preventable by immunisation with diphtheria toxoid vaccine. Transmission is by res piratory tract droplets, or by direct contact with skin lesions or contaminated articles. Cutaneous toxigenic diphtheria is more efficiently transmitted than respiratory toxigenic diphtheria and can cause respiratory infection in others.2, 3 Humans are the only known host for diphtheria, and the disease is usually spread by close personal contact with a case or carrier, or occasionally by fomites or food. The disease remains communicable for up to four weeks after infection, but carriers of C. diphtheriae may continue to shed the organism and be a source of infection for much longer. Classic diphtheria has a gradual onset after an incubation period of two to five days. Symptoms and signs may be mild at first, but progress over one to two days with the development of a mildly painful tonsillitis or pharyngitis with an associated greyish membrane. Diphtheria should be suspected particularly if the membrane extends to the uvula and soft palate. The nasopharynx may also be obstructed by a greyish membrane, which leaves a bleeding area if disturbed. The breath of a patient with diphtheria has a characteristic mousy smell. The major complication of diphtheria is respiratory obstruction, although most deaths result from the effects of diphtheria toxin on various organs. Of importance is the toxicity to the myocardium (leading to myocarditis and heart failure), peripheral nerves (resulting in demyelination and paralysis), and kidneys (resulting in tubular necrosis). The neuropathy begins two to eight weeks after disease onset, while the myocar ditis can be early or late. Neurological complications occur in 15 -20 percent of cases and can cause paralysis up to two months after disease onset.1 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 161 6.3 Epidemiology 6.3.1 Global burden of disease In the pre -immunisation era, diphtheria was predominantly a disease of children aged under 15 years; most adults acquired immunity without experiencing cli nical diphtheria. Asymptomatic carriage was common (3 -5 percent ) and important in perpetuating both endemic and epidemic diphtheria. The global incidence of diphtheria dropped dramatically during the 20th century. Immunisation played a large part but may n ot be wholly responsible for this reduction (see Figure 6.1). The estimated total number of diphtheria cases globally fell from just under 100,000 cases in 1980 to around 4,500 in 2015, but increased to over 16,500 cases in 2018.4 Diphtheria remains a significant health issue in countries with low immunisation coverage. Around 14 percent of children globally are not fu lly immunised against diphtheria and all countries have pockets of unvaccinated children.5 Most cases of diphtheria reported during 2011 -2015 were in South -East Asia, in particular India and Indonesia, but under -reporting has been shown for Africa and Eastern Mediterranean regions.5 Figure 6.1: Diphtheria global annual reported cases and DTP3* immunisation coverage, 1980 -2018 * Three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine in infancy. Source: WHO/UNICEF as of December 2019 162 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Immunisation leads to the disappearance of circulating toxigenic strains, but non - toxigenic strains infected with the -corynebacteriophage can become toxigenic during outbreaks. The return of epidemic diphtheria is a real threat when herd immunity is insufcient, as happened in th e states of the former Soviet Union during 1990 -1997. Factors contributing to this epidemic included a large population of susceptible adults, decreased childhood immunisation, suboptimal socioeconomic conditions and high population movement.6 Most reported cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated adolescents and adults ( 40 percent of cases were age over 15 years in high -incidence countries and 66 percent in low incidence countries) due to historically low coverage and a lack of booster doses to maintain protection in adolescents and adults. This vulnerability in adults wa s highlighted by a recent outbreak in Indonesia.7 However, continu ing endemic cutaneous diphtheria in indigenous communities has been reported from the US, Canada and Australia. Small diphtheria outbreaks occurring in high -income countries often appear to be caused by non -immune individuals travelling to endemic countrie s.1 The overall case fatality rate for clinical diphtheria is 5 -10 percent , with highe r death rates (up to 20 percent ) among persons younger than 5 and older than 40 years. The case-fatality rate for diphtheria has changed very little during the last 50 years.8 Diphtheria remains rare in high -income countries such as New Zealand due to high coverage with diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines. 6.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Diphtheria infection was common in New Zealand until the 1960s. The last case of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria was reported in 1998.9 Low numbers of cutaneous toxigenic diphtheria are regularly notified in New Zealand: two confirmed cases were notified in 2015 in refugees from Afghanistan10 and one case was notified in 2019 in an immunised child from Papua New Guinea. Non-toxigenic C. diphtheria isolates continue to be identified; for example, there were seven throat and 41 cutaneous non -toxigenic isolates and seven from othe r sites in 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020). These strains do not cause diphtheria disease. Travel to endemic countries is an important risk factor for infection, but transmission within New Zealand can occur to susceptible contacts of cutaneous cases. Tattooing practices in the Pacific Islands have also been implicated in outbreaks in New Zealand.11 The 2005 -2007 National Serosurvey of Vaccine Preventable Diseases found that 61 percent of 6-10-year-olds, 77 percent of 11 -15-year-olds, 71 percent of 16-24-year-olds, 48 percent of 25 -44-year-olds and 46 percent of 45 -year-olds had presumed protective levels of diphtheria antibody.12 The decline apparent with age suggests there is likely to be a large and increasing pool of older adults who may be susceptible to diphtheria in New Zealand, despite the introduction of adult tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vacc ination in 1994. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 163 For details of diphtheria notifications, refer to the most recent ESR notifiable disease annual tables and reports (available at https://surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/sur veillance.php ). 6.4 Vaccines Diphtheria toxoid is prepared from cell -free puried diphtheria toxin treated with formaldehyde. It is a relatively poor immunogen, which, to improve its efcacy, is usually adsorbed onto an adjuvant, either aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide. Diphtheria toxoid is only available as a component of combination vaccines (in New Zealand as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and Tdap). See Appendix 1 for the history of diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines in New Zealand. 6.4.1 Available vaccines Funded diphtheria vaccines The diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines funded as part of the Schedule are as follows. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa, GSK): diphtheria, B and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, which contains: not less than 30 IU of diphtheria and 40 IU of tetanus toxoids and three puried Bordetella pertussis antigens \u00b5g 8 of pertactin, 69 kilodalton outer membrane protein) adsorbed onto aluminium salts three types of inactivated polio viruses: 40 D -antigen units of type 1 (Mahoney), 8 D -antigen units of type 2 (MEF -1) and 32 D -antigen units of type 3 (Saukett) 10 \u00b5g of purified major surface antigen (HBsAg) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) 10 \u00b5g of purified polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), covalent ly bound to 20 -40 \u00b5g tetanus toxoid, adsorbed onto aluminium salts lactose, sodium 199, potassium chloride, disodium phosphate, phosphate, neomycin sulphate and polymyxin B sulphate, which are also present as other components or as trace residuals from the manufacturing process. 164 IMMUNISATION pertussis and inactivated polio vaccine, in the same quantities as for Infanrix -hexa above. Other components and residuals include sodium chloride, aluminium salts, Medium 199, potassium chloride, GSK): adult dose of diphtheria toxoid and pertussis antigens together with tetanus toxoid. Tdap contains not less than 2 IU of diphtheria toxoid, not less than 20 IU of tetanus toxoid, 8 \u00b5g of pertussis toxoid, \u00b5g of adsorbed onto aluminium salts. Other components and trace residuals include sodium chloride, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 and glycine. Other vaccines Other diphtheria toxoi d-containing vaccines registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) New Zealand against toxigenic diphtheria occurs via an antibody mediated respons e to the diphtheria toxin and is primarily of the IgG type. Antitoxin antibodies can pass through the placenta to provide passive immunity to the newborn. Although there are no randomised controlled studies on the efficacy of the vaccine, between 87 and 9 8 percent protection has been demonstrated using population -based analyses. Immunised cases have been shown to have less severe disease, as highlighted during the outbreak in the former Soviet Union. Vaccines combining pertussis antigens with diphtheria a nd tetanus toxoids have been gradually introduced into immunisation schedules throughout the world. Immunogenicity data for these combination vaccines is discussed in section 15.4.2 . Herd immunity Immunisation is more effective at preventing disease, by neutralising diphtheria toxin, than preventing infection. Herd immunity is created by reducing carriage and transmission from symptomatic patients.13, 14 To prevent major community outbreaks, it has been suggested that 70 percent or more of the childhood population must be immune to diphtheria.15, 16 Herd immunity in adults is likely to depend on the size of the reservoir of disease in children.1 This may explain the control of diphtheria in New Zealand despite historically relatively poor coverage. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 165 Duration of immunity Diphtheria antitoxin levels decline over time in c hildren after they have received a primary series of vaccines, and a booster dose is required. In countries where diphtheria immunisation is common practice and high coverage rates are achieved, there will be no natural boosting from circulating disease, a nd antitoxin levels declining with increasing age may result in a susceptible older adult population.5 WHO identified that adults in countries with long -standing childhood immunisation programmes were likely to be susceptible without booster doses to overcome waning immunity due to lack of exposure to diphtheria. Waning immunity contributed to the high num ber of cases in adults observed during the outbreak in the former Soviet Union.17 Despite apparent immunity gaps, there has been minimal disease in high -income countries, suggesting that the established correlates of seroprotection based on antitoxin levels may not be reliable guides for protection and that other factors may be operating.18 For example, a high proportion of the adult German population have low antibody levels, indicating susceptibility, yet diphtheria outbreaks have not occurred despite Germany 's relative geographical proximity to high rates of disease in the former Soviet Union.19 The duration of protection after Tdap boosters is unknown, but the results of an Australian study have shown that five years after the Tdap booster dose, 94.4 percent of adults had seroprotective levels of antibodies against diphtheria, compared with 93.7 percent who received Td vaccine.20 It has been predicted that 95 percent of the adult population in the US would maintain seroprotection for more than 30 years without requiring further booster doses.21 6.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) Do not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and Td ap should be stored in the dark. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the supplied container of the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the vial containing the Hib -PRP pellet. After adding the vaccine to the pellet , the mixture should be shaken until the pellet is completely dissolved. Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kept for up to eight hours at 21\u00b0C. 166 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 6.4.4 Dosage and of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV or Tdap vaccine is 0.5 mL, administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV or Tdap vaccine can be administered simultaneously (at separate sites) with other vaccines or IGs. 6.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Table 6.1: Immunisation schedule for diphtheria -containing vaccines (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment Pregnant women - recommended from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester (funded when given any time in second or third trimester) Tdap Booster for mothera Passive immunity for infant 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 4 years DTaP -IPV Booster 11 years Tdap Booster 45 years (individuals who have not received 4 tetanus vaccinations in their lifetime) Tdap Booster 65 years Tdap Booster a Tdap booster during pregnancy is to protect against mother and newborn against pertussis (see section 4.1.2). 6.5.1 Usual childhood schedule A primary course of diphther ia vaccine is given as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, followed by a dose of DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV) at age 4 years ( Table 6.1). A booster is given at age 11 years (school year 7), which includes a pertussis component given as the vaccine Tdap (Boostrix). If a course of immunisation is late or interrupted for any reason, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses (see Appendix 2 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 167 6.5.2 Catch -ups for individuals aged 10 years and older For previously unimmunised individuals aged 10 years and older, a primary immunisation course consists of three doses of a diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccine at intervals of not less than four weeks (see Appendix 2 ). For children aged under 18 years, a booster dose is recommended at least six months after the third dose. Children aged under 18 years may receive Tdap (funded from age 7 to under 18 years); adults age d 18 years and older may receive Td (funded) or Tdap (unfunded). Although Tdap and Td are not approved for use (registered) as a primary course, there are expected to be no safety concerns. 6.5.3 Booster doses for adolescents and adults Studies overseas show th at many adults lack protective levels of the antitoxin, and this has led to concern about waning immunity and recommendations for booster doses beyond childhood (see also section 6.3.2). Most authorities recommend maintaining diphtheria immunity by periodic reinforcement using a combined Td vaccine.1 A single booster dose of Tdap induces seroprotective levels of antibodies to diphtheria and tetanus in virtually all children and adolescent s, and in a high proportion of adults and elderly individuals at approximately one month post vaccination, irrespective of their vaccination history.22 Tdap is recommended and funded: as a booster dose to all adolescents at school year 7 or age 11 years as a booster dose for vaccination of individuals aged 65 years old as a single dose for catch -up vaccination of individuals aged 45 years old who have not had four previous tetanus -containing doses. These age -specic recommendations may facilitate the linkage of adult immunisation to the delivery of other preve ntive health measures. Booster doses before travel If someone is travelling to an area endemic for diphtheria, or there is another reason to ensure immunity, a booster dose is recommended (but not funded) if it is more than 10 years since the last dose. F or website sources on travel vaccines, see Appendix 9 . 168 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 6.5.4 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap in every pregnancy so that antibodi es can pass to the fetus to provide pertussis protection from birth (funded when given any time in second or third trimester ). It is recommended to be given from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester to protect both the mother and her infant from pertussis (see section 16.5.2 ).23 Tdap vaccine may also be given to pregnant women when catch -up is needed for an under -immunised woman, or for management of a tetanus -prone wound (see section 20.5.5 ).23, 24 Tdap vaccines can given to breastfeeding women.24 6.5.5 (Re)vaccination Diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccines are funded for (re)vaccination of eligible patients as follows, including prior to planned or following immunosuppression. See also additional four doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for (re)vaccination of patien ts: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for children requiring solid organ transplantation. Tdap (Boostrix) An additional four doses (as appropriate) of Tdap (Boostrix) are funded for patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 169 6.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 6.6.1 Contraindications There are no specic contraindications to diphtheria vaccine (as Tdap or DTaP), except for anaphylaxis to a previous dose or any component of the vaccine. Most other cases of hypersensitivity that have been reported for tetanus -containing vaccines were in individuals who have had an excessive number of booster injections outside the guidelines noted above (see section 20.6.2 ). 6.6.2 Precautions See section 15.6.2 for precautions for pertussis -containing vaccines and section 20.6.2 for precautions for tetanus -containing vaccines. 6.7 Potential responses and AEFIs Despite the widespread use of diphtheria toxoid, the 1994 Institute of Medicine review of vaccine reactions did not identify any reaction for which the eviden ce favoured or established a causal relationship with diphtheria toxoid.25 However, local and systemic reactions do occur with diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccine, especially when the infant vaccine is used in older children and adults. Mild discomfort or pain at the injection site persisting for up to a few days i s common.24 See also sections 15.7 and 20.7 for potential responses and AEFIs to HANDBOOK 2020 6.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of diphtheria be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. Alert the laboratory that the sample is from a suspected case of diphtheria. All isolates of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans are notifiable until toxigenicity is determined, including cutaneous isolates. If the isolate is determined to be nontoxigenic (ie, does not have the ability to produce diphtheria toxin), the case should be denotified. All patients with C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans isolated from a clinical specimen should be discussed with the medical ofcer of health urgently. All contacts should h ave cultures taken. 6.8.1 Antimicrobial prophylaxis All close contacts, after cultures have been taken and regardless of immunisation status, should receive: a single intramuscular dose of benzathine penicillin (450 mg for children aged under 6 years; 900 mg fo r contacts aged 6 years or older), or 7 to 10 days of oral erythromycin (children: 40 mg/kg per day; adults: 1 g per day, in four divided doses). Benzathine penicillin is preferred for contacts who cannot be kept under surveillance. In contacts with a positive culture: two follow -up cultures should be obtained at least 24 hours after completion of therapy. If cultures are still positive, discuss further management with an infectious disease physician. The primary health care practitioner should be kept informed of the management of contacts and laboratory results. 6.8.2 Vaccination of contacts All close contacts should also be offered a complete course of vaccine or a booster according to the following schedule. Fully immunised children aged under 10 years wh o have only received three doses of diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccine: give one injection of a diphtheria toxoid - containing vaccine. Fully immunised individuals aged 10 years and older who have not received a booster dose of a diphtheria toxoid -containi ng vaccine within the last ve years: IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 171 give one injection of Tdap - funded if aged 10 -17 years; unfunded if aged 18 years or older (see section 6.5). Unimmunised indi viduals: see Appendix 2 . 6.8.3 Exclusion of contacts Child contacts should be excluded from school, early childhood services and community gatherings until they are know n to be culture negative. Adult contacts who are food handlers or who work with children should be excluded from work until known to be culture negative. Cases should be excluded from school until recovery has taken place and two negative throat swabs have been collected one day apart and one day after cessation of antibiotics.

Incubation period Unknown, but probably 2 -4 days. Period of communicability May be prolonged. Non -communicable within 24-48 hours after starting effective antimicrobial therapy. Burden of disease Children aged under 5 years , particularly those aged under 1 year: meningitis, 0.5 mL per dose after reconstitution pre-filled syringe and glass vial - the vaccines must be reconstituted prior to injection intramuscular injection (Hib-PRP-T can also be administered subcutaneously). Funded vaccine indications and schedule Usual childhood schedule: at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months: DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib at age 15 months: Hib -PRP-T. For (re)vaccination of eligible patients: up to 4 additional doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for eligible children <10 years); or 1 additional dose of Hib -PRP-T. For children <10 y ears receiving solid organ transplantation: up to 5 doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib. For testing for primary immune deficiencies: Hib -PRP-T. Vaccine effectiveness Hib disease has been almost eliminated in countries where Hib vaccine is used. Public health measures All cases of Hib disease be notied immediately on suspicion. All contacts should have their immunisation status assessed and updated as appropriate. Post exposure prophylaxis Rifampicin prophylaxis should be administered to contacts as appropriate. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 175 7.1 Bacteriology Haemophilus influenzae is coccobacillus, which occurs typeable and non-typeable (NTHi) forms. There are six antigenically distinct capsular types (a -f), of which type b is the most important. Before the introducti on of the vaccine, H. influenzae type b (Hib) caused 95 percent of H. influenzae invasive disease in infants and children. 7.2 Clinical features Transmission is by inhalation of respiratory tract droplets or by direct contact with respiratory tract secretions. Hib causes meningitis and other focal infections (such as pneumonia, septic arthritis and cellulitis) in children, primarily those aged unde r 2 years, while epiglottitis was more common in children over 2 years. Invasive Hib disease was rare over the age of 5 years, but could occur in adults. In the absence of vaccination these presentations may still occur. There have always been a small numb er of cases of H. influenzae invasive disease in adults, and these continue to occur. The incubation period of the disease is unknown, but is probably from two to four days. Immunisation against Hib does not protect against infections due to other H. influe nzae types or NTHi strains. Non -typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) organisms usually cause non -invasive mucosal infections, such as otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis, but can occasionally cause bloodstream infection, especially in neonates. They are frequen tly present (60 -90 percent ) in the normal upper respiratory tract flora. Young infants (aged under 2 years) do not produce an antibody response following Hib invasive disease, so a course of Hib -PRP vaccine is recommended when they have recovered (see section 7.5.3). Hib and NTHi strains also cause diseases (including pneumonia and septicaemia) in the elderly. 7.3 Epidemiology 7.3.1 Global burden of disease The source of the organism is the upper respiratory tract. Immunisation with a protein conjugate vaccine reduces the frequency of asymptomatic colonisation by Hib. Before the introduction of the vaccine, Hib was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children. Worldwide immunisation coverage is increasing, with approximately 194 countr ies having fully or partially introduced Hib onto their schedules by July 2019 (98 percent of all WHO member states).1 The estimated global coverage for three doses of Hib is 72 percent as of July 2019 .2 176 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 7.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Hib-PRP was introduced in 1994 (see Appendi x 1). In 1993, 101 children aged under 5 years had laboratory -confirmed invasive Hib disease (an age -specific rate of 36.4 per 100,000 population). By 1999 only five children in this age group had laboratory - confirmed disease (1.7 per 100,000) (Figure 7.1). Two cases of Hib were notified and laboratory confirmed in 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020). The cases were aged 50 -59 and 60 -69 years, both were unvaccinated. There were seven deaths from Hib betwe en 1997 and 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020), the most recent was in 2012 in an adult over 70 years of age.3 Figure 7.1: Number of notifications and culture -positive ca ses of Haemophilus influenzae type b invasive disease, 1997 -2019 Source: ESR For details of Hib notifications, refer to the most recent ESR notifiable disease annual tables and reports (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). 7.4 Vaccines Antibodies to PRP, a component of the polysaccharide cell capsule of Hib, are protective against invasive Hib disease. To induce a T -cell dependent immune response, the polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) polysaccharide has been linked (conjugated) to a variety of protein carriers. These conjugate Hib vaccines are immunogenic and effective in young infants (see also section 1.4.3). The protein carriers used are either an outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis (Hib-PRP-OMP vaccine), or a tetanus toxoid (Hib -PRP-T vaccine). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 177 Note that the protein conjugates used in Hib vaccines are not themselves expected to be immunogenic and do not give protection against N. meningitidis or tetanus. 7.4.1 Available vaccines Funded vaccines The Hib vaccines funded as part of the Schedule are: Hib-PRP-T, given as the hexavalent vaccine DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib GSK). It contains diphtheria, tetanus, llular pertussis, inactivated polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (see section 6.4 for more information) Hib-PRP-T given as monovalent Hib vaccine (Hiberix, GSK). It contains 10 \u00b5g of purified Hib capsular polysaccharide conjugated to 25 \u00b5g of inactivated tetanus toxoid. Other components (excipients) include lactose in the vaccine and sterile saline solution in the diluent. Other vaccine s No other Hib vaccines are available currently. Hib -PRP-T (Act-HIB, Sanofi) was the funded vaccine prior to the 1 July 2017 Schedule change. 7.4.2 Efcacy and effectiveness The high efficacy and effectiveness of Hib -PRP vaccines have been clearly demonstrated by the virtual elimination of Hib in countries implementing the vaccine,4, 5, 6 including New Zealand. Hib -PRP vaccines are highly effective after a primary course of two or three doses.7, 8, 9 Disease following a full course of Hib -PRP is rare. Conjugate vaccines reduce carriage in immunised children and as a result also decrease carriage and disease in unimmunised people (herd immunity). These vaccines will not protect against infection with NTHi strains, and therefore do not prevent the great majority of otitis media, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis or bronchitis. (See also section 15.4.2 for information about the DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine.) Duration of immunity A primary series followed by a booster dose in the second year of life should provide sufficient antibody levels to prot ect against invasive Hib disease to at least the age of 5 years.10 178 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 7.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) Do not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib should be stored in the dark. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine (Infanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the pre -filled syringe containing DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the vial containing the Hib powder. After adding the vaccine to the powder, the mixture should be shaken until the powder is completely dissolved. Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kept for up to eigh t hours at 21\u00b0C. Hib-PRP-T vaccine (Hiberix) must be reconstituted with the supplied diluent and used immediately after reconstitution. 7.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and Hib -PRP-T vaccines is 0.5 mL administered by intramuscular injection. Hib -PRP-T can also be administered subcutaneously if indicated (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and Hib -PRP-T vaccines can be co -administered with other routine vaccines on the Schedule, in separate syringes and at separate sites. 7.5 Recommended immun isation schedule 7.5.1 Usual childhood schedule Hib vaccine is funded for all children aged under 5 years. Three doses of DTaP -IPV- HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) vaccine are given as the primary course, with a booster of Hib-PRP-T (Hiberix ) at age 15 months (see Table 7.1). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 179 Table 7.1: Usual childhood Hib schedule (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 15 months Hib-PRP-T Booster For children aged under 5 years who, for whatever reason, have missed out on Hib vaccine in infancy, a catch -up schedule is recommended. The total number of doses of Hib vaccine required is determined by the age at which Hib immunisation commences. Where p ossible, the combined available vaccines should be used, but individual immunisation schedules based on the recommended national schedule may be required for children who have missed some immunisations (see Appendix 2 ). 7.5.2 Special groups Children Because of an increased risk of infection, it is particularly important that the following groups of children, whatever their age, receive the Hib vaccine as early as possible (see also sections 4.2 and 4.3): children with anatomical or functional asplenia, or who are suffering from sickle cell disease (if possible, it is recom mended that children be immunised prior to splenectomy) children with partial immunoglobulin deciency, Hodgkin 's disease or following chemotherapy (note, however, that response to the vaccine in these children is likely to be suboptimal) children with nep hrotic syndrome HIV-positive children. Recommendations for Hib vaccine for older children and adults with asplenia Although there is no strong evidence of an increased risk of invasive Hib disease in asplenic older children and adults, some authorities re commend Hib immunisation for these individuals.11, 12 The Hib PRP -T vaccine has been shown to be immunogenic in adults. Hib-PRP-T vaccine (Hiberix) is funded for older children and adults pre - or post - splenectomy or with functional asplenia; one dose of vaccine is recommended (see also section 4.3.4) if childhood vaccine schedule is incomplete or unknown. Note: Pneumococcal, mening ococcal, influenza, varicella and pertussis -containing vaccines are also recommended for these individuals; see section 4.3 and the relevant disease chapters. 180 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 7.5.3 Child ren who have recovered from invasive Hib disease Children aged under 2 years with Hib disease do not reliably produce protective antibodies and need to receive a complete course of Hib -PRP-T. The number of doses required will depend on the age at which the rst dose after the illness is given, ignoring any doses given before the illness (follow the age -appropriate catch -up schedules in Appendix 2 ). Commence immunisa tion approximately four weeks after the onset of disease. Any immunised child who develops Hib disease or who experiences recurrent episodes of Hib invasive disease requires immunological investigation by a paediatrician. 7.5.4 (Re)vaccination Hib-PRP-containing vaccines are funded for vaccination and revaccination of eligible patients, as follows. See also section 4.3. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) Up to an additional four doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib are funded for vaccination or revaccination of children aged under 10 years: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib are funded for children aged under 10 years receiving solid organ transplantation. Hib-PRP-T (Hiberix) One additional dose of Hib -PRP-T (Hiberix) is funded for vaccination or revaccination of patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy or with functional asplenia pre- or post -solid organ transplant pre- or post -cochlear implants undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or after other severely immunosuppressive regimens. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 181 7.5.5 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Hib-PRP is not routinely recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, for women with asplenia see the 'Recommendations for Hib vaccine for older children and adul ts with asplenia ' in section 7.5.2. 7.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general vaccine contraindications. Ana phylaxis to a previous vaccine dose or any component of the vaccine is an absolute contraindication to further vaccination with that vaccine. See section 15.6 for contraindications and precautions to DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. Hib-PRP-T vaccines should not be administered to people with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of Hib vaccine or to a vaccine component. Signicant hypersensitivity reacti ons to Hib vaccines appear to be extremely rare. 7.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See section 15.7.1 for potential responses and AEFIs with DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. 7.7.1 Potential responses Adverse reactions to Hib -PRP conjugate vaccines are uncommon. Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site occur in approximately 25 percent of recipients, but these symptoms typically are mild and last less than 24 hours.13 7.7.2 AEFIs A meta -analysis of trials of Hib -PRP vaccination from 1990 to 1997 found that serious adverse events were rare.14 No serious vaccine -related adverse experiences were observed during clinical trials of Hib vaccine alone. There have been rare reports, not proven to be causally related to Hib vaccine, of transverse myelitis, thrombocytopenia and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS).15 182 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 7.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of Hib disease be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health, who will arrange for contact tracing, immunisation and administration of prophylactic rifampicin, where appropriate. For further information see the Communicable Disease Control Manual .16 7.8.1 Management of contacts All child contacts should have their immunisation status assessed and updated, as appropriate. Immunisation reduces - but does not necessarily p revent - the acquisition and carriage of Hib. Therefore, immunised children still need rifampicin prophylaxis, when indicated, to prevent them transmitting infection to their contacts. Careful observation of exposed household and early childhood service co ntacts is essential. Exposed children who develop a febrile illness should receive prompt medical evaluation. Rifampicin chemoprophylaxis To eradicate the carrier state and protect susceptible children, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be given to contact s as soon as possible, and ideally within seven days of the index case developing the disease, irrespective of their own immunisation status. Prophylaxis started after seven days may still be of benefit and is recommended. Note that the prophylaxis for Hib is different from that for meningococcal disease (see chapter 13). Rifampicin recommendations Chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin is recommended for the following co ntacts of an index case of Hib: all members of the case 's household (including adults) where there is at least one contact aged under 4 years who is either unimmunised or partially immunised all members of a household where there is a child aged under 12 months, even if the child has had three doses (primary series) of the Hib -PRP vaccine all members of a household where there is an immunosuppressed person all staff and children at an early childhood service where two or more cases of Hib have occurred within 60 days. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 183 Use oral rifampicin 20 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg) daily for four days. The dose for infants aged under 4 weeks has not been established, but a dose of 10 mg/kg per day is recommended. This is a different regimen to that recommended fo r prophylaxis from meningococcal disease (see chapter 13). The index case should also receive rifampicin unless treated with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Rifampicin is not recommended for: occupants of households where there are no children aged under 4 years, other than the index case occupants of households where all contacts aged 12 months to under 4 years have completed their immunisation series, includ ing the second -year-of-life dose pregnant women - rifampicin is contraindicated in pregnant women; pregnant women who are a household contact of an index case should receive ceftriaxone. For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Haemophilus infl uenzae type b invasive disease (Hib) ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -contro l-manual -2012 ).16 7.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheets The Hib -PRP-T (Hiberix) data sheet states that the vaccine is not intended for use in adults. However, the Ministry of Health recommends that asplenic adults (see section 7.5.2) or adults with specif ied immunocompromised conditions (see section 7.5.4) receive Hib -PRP-T vaccine.11, 17 There are not expected to be any safety concerns in regard to use in older age groups.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 185 8 Hepatitis A Key information Mode of transmission Faecal -oral route, either from person -to-person contact or through contaminated food or drink. It is also occasionally spread by injected drug use. Incubation period 28-30 days average (range 15 -50 days). Period of communicability The 1 -2 weeks before and the first few days after the onset of jaundice. Burden of disease Infants and children are usually asymptomatic. Severity in adults increases with age. The d isease is more serious in those with chronic liver disease and the immunocompromised. There is no carrier state. Funded vaccines Monovalent inactivated hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine: Havrix. Other available Monovalent inactivated hepatitis per dose. Havrix Junior, Avaxim: 0.5 mL per dose. Pre-filled syringe. Intramuscular injection. Funded vaccine indications and recommended schedule HepA vaccine (Havrix) is recommended and funded for: transplant patients - 2 doses children with chronic live r disease - 2 doses close contacts of hepatitis A cases - 1 dose. Recommended, unfunded Individuals working with children, exposed to faeces or contaminated water, or with non -human primates Armed forces personnel and travellers visiting high-risk countries Adults with chronic liver disease, including with chronic hepatitis B and C infection Men who have sex with men Food handlers during community outbreaks Vaccine efficacy High efficacy: HAV infection has been almost eliminated in immuni sed populations. Public health measures All cases of hepatitis A must be notied immediately on suspicion to local medical officer of health Post-exposure prophylaxis In an outbreak (if within 2 weeks of exposure): age <12 months: human normal immunoglobulin is recommended 12 months: age -appropriate vaccination is recommended. 186 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 8.1 Virology Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus belonging to the picornavirus group, which also contains enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The virus is usually transmitted by the faecal -oral route, either from person -to-person contact or through contaminated food or drink. HAV primarily replicates in the liver and is excreted in large quantities via the biliary tract into the faeces. It is a hardy virus and can survive outside the body for prolonged periods in food and water. It causes a self -limiting illness with no carrier state. 8.2 Clinical features The incubation period between ingestion of the virus and clinical symptoms is 15 to 50 days, with an avera ge of 28 to 30 days. The virus can be detected in blood and faeces within a few days of ingestion, and it increases to a peak in the two weeks prior to the onset of clinical illness, which is the time that subjects are most likely to spread the infection. Faecal viral shedding continues for one to three weeks in adults, but has been reported to last longer in young children. Virus excretion falls sharply in the week following the onset of hepatitis. In infants and preschool children, most infections are ei ther asymptomatic or cause only mild, non -specic symptoms without jaundice. Most adults and adolescents develop symptomatic disease, the severity of which generally increases with age. Symptomatic HAV infection is characterised by an acute febrile illness with jaundice, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, malaise and dark urine. Signs and symptoms usually last less than two months, although 10 -15 percent of symptomatic persons have prolonged or relapsing illness lasting up to six months. Liver enzymes almost always return to normal by six months after the illness, and often much sooner. The disease is more serious in people with chronic liver disease or those who are immunocompromised (including people with HIV infection). Chronic carrier states do not occur following hepatitis A infection and persisting liver damage is very rare. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 187 8.3 Epidemiology 8.3.1 Global burden of disease HAV is common in areas with poor sanitary conditions and limited access to clean water.1 In highly endemic areas, such as parts of Africa and Asia, the disease is virtually conned to early childhood and is not an important cause of morbidity.1, 2 Almost all adults in these areas are immune, and hepatitis A epidemics are uncommon. In intermediate endemicity areas, such as Central and South America, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia, children may not be infected in early c hildhood and reach adulthood without immunity. A high proportion of adolescents and adults are susceptible and large outbreaks are common. In low endemicity areas, such as the US and Western Europe, infection is less common but can occur in high -risk group s. Large outbreaks are rare, due to high levels of sanitation that stops person -to-person transmission. Viral spread occurs readily in households, in early childhood services and in residential facilities that care for the chronically ill, disabled or tho se with a weakened immune system. In early childhood services, typically the adult guardian develops symptomatic disease while the primary source, the infected young child, is asymptomatic. The risk of spread in early childhood centres is proportional to t he number of children aged under 2 years wearing nappies. Infection in these early childhood services is an important source of outbreaks for whole communities. Other groups at the highest risk of contracting the disease include people in close contact wi th an infected person, and travellers to areas with high or intermediate rates of hepatitis A infection. Others also at greater risk of contracting HAV are people who have oral -anal sexual contact, illicit drug users, those with chronic liver disease, food handlers and laboratory staff working with the virus. Universal and targeted programmes for childhood immunisation have been introduced in several countries, including Israel, the US and Australia. Acute HAV infection has almost been eradicated in areas with HAV immunisation programmes. 8.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology The rate of HAV in New Zealand declined from 145.7 per 100,000 in 1971 to 1.2 per 100,000 in 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020).3, 4 This fall in rate is attributable to the use of HAV vaccination in travellers and a reduction in HAV prevalence overseas. In 2019, 58 cases were notified compared with 68 in 2018 (ESR, 8 June 2020). Hospitalisation status was recorded for 57 cases, of which, 36 (63 percent ) were hospitalised. The highest rates occurred in the 15 -19 years (2.2 per 100,000) and 1 -4- and 20 -29- years age groups (both 2.0 per 100,000). Of the 56 cases with ethnicity information 188 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 recorded, Pacific peoples had the hi ghest notification rate (5.4 per 100,000), followed by the Asian (3.1 per 100,000) ethnic groups (ESR, 8 June 2020). Overseas travel information was recorded for 55 cases: 32 cases (58.2 percent ) had travelled overseas during the incubation period of the disease (ESR, 8 June 2020). The countries most frequently visited included India and Samoa (7 cases each), Fiji (5 cases), Indonesia (4 cases) and Tonga (3 cases). Four cases reported travel to more than one country. Hepatitis A outbreaks continue to occu r. There was one outbreak in 2019, involving 10 cases (ESR, 8 June 2020). Figure 8.1 illustrates the overall national downward trend since a peak of notifications in 1997. Figure 8.1: Hepatitis A notifications, by year, 1997 -2019 Source: ESR For further details of hepatitis A notifications in New Zealand, refer to the most recent notifiable disease annual reports from ESR (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/ann ual_surveillance.php ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 189 Vaccines 8.4.1 Available vaccines Two inactivated HAV vaccines (HepA) are currently registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) in New Zealand, as well as a combined HepA -HepB vaccine and a combined HepA -typhoid vaccine. Funde d vaccine Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) is not on the Schedule, but is recommended and funded for certain high -risk groups, as shown in Table 8.1. Each 1.0 mL dose of Ha vrix (GSK) contains 1,440 HAV onto aluminium hydroxide. Each 0.5 mL dose of Havrix Junior contains 720 EU of inactivated HAV. Other components and residuals include neomycin sulphate, 2 -phenoxyethanol, polysorbate 20, amino acid supplement in a phosphate buffered saline solution. Other vaccines Inactivated HAV vaccine Avaxim (Sanofi) contains 160 antigen units of inactivated HAV in each 0.5 mL dose; other components and residuals include aluminium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, Medium 199, neomycin and serum albumin. Combined HAV and HBV vaccine Twinrix (GSK) contains 720 EU of inactivated HAV and 20 \u00b5g of recombinant DNA HBsAg vaccine in each 1.0 mL dose. The Twinrix Jun ior preparation (0.5 mL per dose) contains half these amounts. The vaccines are adsorbed onto aluminium adjuvants. Other components and residuals include aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, sodium chloride, amino acids, dibasic sodium phosphate, form aldehyde, monobasic sodium phosphate, neomycin sulphate, HAV and typhoid vaccines Vivaxim (Sanofi) contains 160 antigen units of inactivated HAV and 25 \u00b5g of purified Salmonella typhi Vi polysaccharide in each 1.0 m L dose; other components and residuals include sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, 199, bovine serum albumin. 190 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 8.4.2 Efficacy and effectiveness After one dose of monovalent HepA in healthy people, protective levels of antibody have been demonstrated by two weeks, and 94 -100 percent of people vaccinated will seroconvert by four weeks.5 A second dose 6 to 18 months after the first is thought to be important for long -term protection, particularly in the absence of exposure to HAV.6, 7 In subjects with an impaired immune system, adequ ate anti -HAV antibody titres may not be obtained after a single dose. Hep A vaccines have not yet been approved for children aged under 12 months. This is due to the potential interference from maternal antibody which may affect long term immunity.8 However, HepA vaccines have been shown to be safe and efficacious in infants as young as 2 months.9 Such that the CDC recom mends HepA vaccination for infants aged 6 -11 months travelling outside of the US.10 HepA vaccines are highly effective in preventing clinical disease, with recorded efficacy measures of around 94 -100 percent from six weeks post -vaccination. Where children, adolescents and young adults have been vaccinated in targeted and/or national programmes, there has been a rapid decline in disease incidence. This decline is through both direct and indirect (herd immunity ) effects.6 Duration of immunit y Antibodies to two doses of HepA have been shown to persist in vaccinated adults for at least 17 years after vaccination, and up to 15 years in vaccinated children and adolescents.11 Mathematical models estimate that following completion of a two -dose series, protective levels of antibody persist for 40 years or longer in adults and 14 -20 years in children.11 Given that HAV has a long incubation period, it is possible that immune memory with no detectable circulating antibody may be sufficient for protection, as is the case with HBV and HepB. 8.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to th e National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) freeze. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 191 8.4.4 Dosage and administration See Table 8.2 for dosage and scheduling information. The monovalent HepA and HepA combination vaccines should be administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid region of the upper arm in adults a nd older children, or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in younger children (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines The monovalent HepA and H epA-combination vaccines may be administered concurrently with other vaccines.11, 12 The vaccines should be given in separate syringes and at different injection sites. Interchangeability of hepa titis A vaccines The monovalent HepA vaccines may be used interchangeably to complete a two -dose course.12 8.5 Recommended immunisation schedule 8.5.1 Recommendations Hepatitis A vaccines are not on the Schedule, but are funded for the high -risk groups as shown in the shaded section of Table 8.1. They may also be employer -funded or funded during an outbreak (see section 8.8). 192 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 8.1: Hepatitis A vaccine recommendations Note: Funded individuals are in shaded rows . See the Pharmaceutical Schedule ( www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for any changes to the funding decisions. Recommended and funded Transplant patientsa Children with chronic liver diseasea Close contactsb of hepatitis A cases Recommended but not funded Adults with chronic liver disease: chronic hepatitis B or C infection other chronic liver disease Men who have sex with men Travellers - including occupationalc and recreational travel Occupational groupsc exposed to faeces, including: employees of early childhood services, particularly where there are children too young to be toilet trained health care workers exposed to faeces sewage workers those who work with non -human primates (eg, zoos, research laboratories). Food handlersc during community outbreaks. Armed forces personnelc who are likely to be deployed to high -risk areas. a. See also section 4.3.10 . b. Only one dose is funded for close contacts as protection is only required for the duration of the outbreak. For long -term protection, contacts may seek a second (unfunded) dose, after an interval of at least 6 months. See the Communicable Disease Control Manual13 for a definition of contacts. c. May be employer -funded. See also section 4.8. Individuals with chronic liver disease HepA is recommended and funded for children with chronic liver disease and for children and adults undergoing transplants (see sections 4.3.10 and 4.5). People with chronic liver disease are not at increased risk for hepatitis A, but acute hepatitis A can have serious or fatal consequences.6 Chronic hepatitis B or C infection Studies have shown that in these individuals, super -infection with HAV leads to increased morbidity and mortality.6 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 193 Other chronic liver disease Non-immune individuals who have not been vaccinated should receive HepA before liver decompensation. It should be given as early as possible before liver transplantation; vaccination may be performed after transplantation, although the response is unlikely to be as good as early in liver disease.14, 15 Travel lers The first dose of HepA should be given as soon as travel is considered.11 The high and intermediate endemicity areas listed in section 8.3.1 may be used as a guide for recommending hepatitis A vaccination for travel, but there are limits to the data that informs these listings, and variation within countries. Even in low prevalence c ountries there is a risk of foodborne hepatitis A. In addition, decreasing prevalence in formerly endemic countries leads to large numbers of susceptible people and the risk of large outbreaks, as has recently been reported. The vaccine may be considered f or all travellers. Although licensed from age 1 year, HepA could also be considered for use in infants younger than 1 year if at significant risk of infection.10 Immunoglobulin is not normally available or recommended in New Zealand for pre-travel use. Certain occupational groups Immunisation with HepA is recommended ( but not funded) for people in occupational groups exposed to faeces, as listed in Table 8.1 above. Others at higher risk Pre-immunisation screening for anti -HAV antibo dies is not routinely recommended. There is no danger in vaccinating an already immune person, but some groups with higher probability of prior infection may wish to avoid the expense of vaccination. These include: those who are likely to have been exposed as children (born in a country of high endemicity) or in the course of their employment those with a history of jaundice. Consider HepA for the following groups: intravenous drug users (who account for 30 percent of cases in communities during outbreaks)6 men who have sex with men. Routine immunisation for children HepA is not routinely recommended and is not on the Schedule for children in New Zealand. It should, however, be considered during community outbreaks (see section 8.8). 194 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 8.5.2 Immunisation schedule Immunisation schedules for HAV -containing vaccines are provided in Table 8.2. See the manufacturers ' data sheets for more information. For monovalent HepA, the first dose is for primary immunisation and the second dose is a booster.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 195 8.5.3 Pregnancy and breastfeeding The safety of HepA during pregnancy and while breastfeeding has not been determined. However, because HepA is produced from inactivated HAV, there is not expected to be any risk to the developing fetus and infant. As a precaution, HepA should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed, such as when travelling to a country where HAV is endemic. 8.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 8.6.1 Contraindications Administration of HepA should be delayed in individuals suffering from acute febrile illness. HepA should not be administered to people with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of HepA or to a vaccine component. 8.6.2 Precautions In individuals with an impaired immune system, adequate anti -HAV antibody titres may not be obtained after a single dose. Pregnancy is a precaution - see section 8.5.3. 8.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 8.7.1 Potential responses Soreness, redness and swelling at the injection site; fever; malaise; headache; nausea; and loss of appetite have been reported for monovale nt HepA, but these responses are usually mild and brief.17 Similar responses are seen with HepA -HepB combination vaccines, HANDBOOK 2020 8.7.2 AEFIs Review of data from multiple sources has not identied any serious adverse events among c hildren and adults that could be attributed to HepA.17 8.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of hepatitis A be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. 8.8.1 Post-exposure prophylaxis and outbreak control Vaccination Age-appropriate vaccine is recommended for all close contacts aged older than 1 year. If time allows, consider pre -vaccine serology if there is a history or likelihood of previous HepA vaccination or infection (eg, previous residence in an endemic country). Post-exposure prophylaxis with vaccine should be offered to contacts as soon as possible, and within two weeks of last exposure to an infectious case. The efficacy of vaccine when administered more than two weeks after exposure has not be en established. Immunoglobulin Where vaccine is contraindicated (or not immediately available), human normal immunoglobulin may be offered to a close contact who may have a reduced response to vaccine or has risk factors for severe disease. The dose is 0. 03 mL/kg given by intramuscular injection. Post -exposure prophylaxis should be offered to contacts as soon as possible, and within two weeks of last exposure to an infectious case. For post -exposure prophylaxis, close contacts aged under 1 year may requir e human normal immunoglobulin. This should be discussed with the appropriate infectious disease physician. Human normal immunoglobulin is available from the New Zealand Blood Service. For further information, see the medicine data sheets or the New Zealan d Blood Service website ( www.nzblood.co.nz ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 197 Early childhood services and other institutional outbreaks If an outbreak occurs in an early childhood service, vaccination (and/or immunoglobulin if appropriate) may be indicated for all previously unimmunised staff and children at the service and unimmunised new staff and children for up to six weeks after the last case has been identified, including cases in the household of attendees. The number of infected cases shou ld determine the extent of intervention. Vaccination and/or immunoglobulin may also be indicated for adults and children at a school, hospital or custodial -care institution where an outbreak of hepatitis A is occurring. For sporadic cases in hospitals, sc hools or work settings, post -exposure prophylaxis is not routinely indicated, but careful hygiene practices should be maintained. Community -wide outbreaks of hepatitis A infection HepA is effective in controlling community -wide epidemics and common -source outbreaks of HAV infection.18 Before the vaccine is used for outbreak control, consideration should be given to the current epidemiology in the community, the population at risk should be defined, and the feasibility and cost of delivering a programme should be assessed. For more det ails on control measures, see the 'Hepatitis A ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease-control -manual -2012 ). 8.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheets Havrix Junior is licensed from ages 1 to 15 years of age. However, for infants travelling to areas at high risk of hepatitis A infection and pre -exposure prophylaxis, the Ministry of Health recommends that HepA vaccination (Havrix Junior) can be given under 1 year of age at least two weeks prior to departure.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 199 9 Hepatitis B Key information Mode of transmission Contact with infected blood or body fluids during childbirth (vertical transmission); sexual intercourse, intravenous drug u se or contact with broken skin (horizontal transmission). Incubation period 45-180 days, commonly 60 -90 days. Period of communicability Potentially infectious 2 -3 weeks before the onset of symptoms, during the clinical disease and usually for 2 -3 months after acute hepatitis B illness; or for as long as HBsAg continues to be present in blood (chronic hepatitis B carrier state). Incidence and burden of disease New Zealand is a country with a low overall prevalence of hepatitis B carriage, but it co ntains certain populations with high prevalence. All pregnant women and high -risk groups should be screened for chronic HBV infection. HBV acquisition in infancy is very likely to lead to chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection can progress to cirrhosis a nd presentation - 1.0 mL per dose, pre -filled syringe 10 \u00b5g presentation - 0.5mL intramuscular mL per dose pre-filled syringe and glass vial - the vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. intramuscular injection. Funded vaccine indications and schedule At ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months: DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib. Infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers should receive HepB vaccine plus HBIG at birth, then the usual childhood schedule. Serological testing at age 9 months (anti -HBs and HBsAg). Individuals with eligible conditions or close household contacts of infected individuals: HepB (see section 9.5). Recommended, unfunded Those with increased risk from occupational or sexual exposure to body fluids and faeces, or receiving regular blood products. Those with developmental disability, current or prior injectable drug users, prison inmates, and travellers to and from high -prevalence countries . Vaccine effectiveness In general, efficacy is 85 -95 percent in high risk groups, though likely to be lower in older individuals and those with immunocompromise. Protection is expected to be lifelong and boosters are not required. Public health measures Notify all cases of acute hepatitis B infection (see section 9.8). 200 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 9.1 Virology The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a partially double -stranded DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family. Three major subunits make up the structural components: the HBV genome, a small, circular, partially double -stranded DNA molecule, in association with a polymerase enzyme the nucleocapsid core, which surrounds the genome and consists of core protein (hepa titis B core antigen, HBcAg) the outer lipoprotein envelope, which contains the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The genome has four genes (S, C, X and P). Both the core nucleocapsid protein (HBcAg) and the 'early ' protein (which makes HBeAg) are tran slated from the C gene. HBcAg is essential for viral packaging and is an integral part of the nucleocapsid. HBeAg is a soluble protein that is not part of the virus particle. Detection of HBeAg in the serum is correlated with viral replication and is a mar ker for severe disease. It is most commonly found in those with acute hepatitis B and those with chronic HBV infection with high viral load.1 9.2 Clinical features There is a broad spectrum of clinical disease with HBV infection, from subclinical through to fulminant hepatitis. Persistent infection can lead to chronic liver disease, potentially causing cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. 9.2.1 Serological markers of infection The HBV antigens and their associated antibodies are serological markers of HBV infect ion or vaccination ( Table 9.1). At least one serological marker is present during the different phases of infection (Table 9.2). Table 9.1: HBV antigens and their respective antibodies Antigen Antibody (IgM, IgG and total) HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) Anti-HBs HBcAg (hepatitis B core antigen) Anti-HBc HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) Anti-HBe IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 9.2: Interpretation of Serological marker Interpretation HBsAg Total anti-HBc IgM anti-HBc Anti-HBs - - - - Never infected + - - - Early acute infection; transient (up to 18 days) after vaccination + + + - Acute infection - + + + or - Acute resolving infection - + - + Recovered from past infection and is immune + + - - Chronic infectiona - - - + Immune if 10 IU/L vaccinated or natural infection Key: Anti -HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti -HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); IgM = immunoglobulin M; + = positive test result; - = negative test result. a HBeAg positive (HBeAg+) correlates with high viral load and increased risk of transmission; HBeAg negative (HBeAg -) correlates with lower viral load and reduced risk of developing cirrhosis or cancer.

Table 25.1. Any difficulties with interpreting serological results for cases and contacts should be discussed with an infectious diseases physician or the laboratory. See the 'Hepatitis B ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual for recommendations for HBV case and contact management (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease ). 9.2.2 Acute hepatitis The virus preferentially infects liver cells, multiplying in the liver and releasing large amounts of HBsAg, which is present in the blood of people with active infection. The incubation period varies between 45 and 180 days and is commonly 60 to 90 days. HBV is not directly cytopathic; the host 's immune response leads to death of infected liver cells. Most infected people mount an effective immune response that leads to eradication of infection over a period of several months. Approximately 80 percent of adults with acute infection have symptomatic hepatitis, and the remaining 20 percent can be asymptomatic (but these proportions vary).2 The common symptoms of acute hepatitis B illness are fever, jaundice, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, myalgia and abdominal pain. Jaundice usually develops within two weeks of onset of the illness, and dark urine and/or clay coloured stools might appear up to five days before clinical jaundice. Clinical signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis B usually resolve one to three months late r.1 There is a small risk of liver failure (less than 1 percent ) with acute infection; if failure occurs, almost half will die or require emergency liver transplantation. 202 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 9.2.3 Chronic HBV infection The main burden of HBV disease occurs in people with chronic HBV infec tion. Chronically infected people are identified by presence and persistence of HBsAg in their serum for at least six months. The age of acquisition of HBV is strongly associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV infection. Approximately 90 percent of those infected perinatally or in infancy develop chronic HBV infection, compared with 30 percent of children infected between ages 1 and 4 years and less than 5 percent of people infected as adults. Infants seldom mount an immune response to HBV infecti on, and infection in infancy is often asymptomatic. Asymptomatic chronic infection stimulates persistent immune responses that may eventually lead to cirrhosis (decades later); cirrhosis and chronic infection increase the risk of development of hepatocellu lar carcinoma. Table 9.3: Characteristics and phases of chronic hepatitis B virus infection Phase s of HBV infection Features Immune tolerance phase Prolonged period of active viral replication without active liver disease. Seen in children who acquire infection perinatally. Immune clearance phase Active viral replication and active liver disease Inactive chronic HBV infection Low or absent viral replication and remission of active liver disease Reactivation HBV replication after inactivity, seen in some patients There are up to four phases of chronic infection as in Table 9.3 show; not all are present in all infections.1 The initial phase of infection may last 10 to 30 years, during which spontaneous clearance rates of HBeAg in the serum are less than 1 percent per year. Chronically infected people who are HBsAg positive can also have detectable HBeAg in the serum; this combination is considered most infec tious. Although recent evidence suggests HBeAg negative patients are less infectious, it is dependent on HBV DNA levels. Whatever the case, both groups can be an ongoing source of infection to susceptible individuals. In the early years of chronic infectio n, high rates of viral replication are common, and both HBeAg and high levels of HBV DNA are present in the blood. In later years, HBeAg may be absent from the blood, and HBV DNA levels (viral load) are usually lower, both of which correspond with lower ra tes of viral replication. It is estimated that 4.5 percent of HBsAg positive individuals (12 million people worldw ide) have been co -infected with hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is a significant contributor to HBV -associated cirrhosis and hepatocellular ca rcinoma.3 The highest prevalence is seen in those with hepatitis C and HIV, and in certain geographic areas. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 203 9.2.4 Routes of transmission HBV is usually transmitted through contact with infected blood or body fluids during childbirth, contact with broken skin, sexual intercourse or intravenous drug use. Although HBV can be fo und in all body fluids, blood has the highest concentration and saliva the lowest. HBV in dried blood remains infective for at least one week.4 Perinatal (vertical) transmission The primary source of HBV infection is perinatal exposure from mothers with chronic HBV infection. Transmission usually occurs at the time of birth. The in utero transmission of HBV is relatively rare, accounting for less than 2 percent of infections trans mitted from mother to infant.5 If no prophylaxis is given to the infant, the baby of an HBeAg positive mother has a 70-90 percent risk of infection, while the baby of an HBeAg negative HBsAg positive carrier mother has a 5 -20 percent risk of infection. Over 90 percent of infants who acquire infection perinatally bec ome chronic carriers. Person -to-person (horizontal) transmission Non-sexual person -to-person transmission probably occurs from inadvertent percutaneous or mucosal contact with blood or infectious body fluids among people in close daily contact (household members). The main sources of transmission are: sexual contact with an infected individual percutaneous exposure to blood or infectious body fluids needle -stick injuries or sharing needles . Those travelling to high endemic countries are at higher risk of exposure (see below). 204 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 9.3 Epidemiology 9.3.1 Global burden of disease Approximately two billion people worldwide had been exposed to HBV in 1995. In 2015, based on serological data, around 3.5 percent of the general population globally were infected with HBV and m ore than 250 million people were estimated to have chronic infection and these people remain at risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.6, 7 More than 90 percent of individuals with chronic HBV resided in the Asia -Pacific region, where most countries have high prevalence rates of HBV infection (the population rate of HBsAg positivity is between 5 and 20 percent ) and more than 99 percent of HBV -infected peo ple in this region acquired infection through vertical transmission from their mother (usually at the time of delivery) or in early childhood.8 As an example of this risk, 22.8 million out of 80 million people living in China with chronic HBV infection are women of child -bearing age.9 Acquisition of HBV during adulthood (usually via sexual transmission or injecting drug use) is associ ated with a high rate of symptomatic hepatitis but a low rate of chronic infection. The introduction of universal childhood HBV immunisation has changed the epidemiology of chronic infection in many countries, but it will be several decades (one to two hu man generations) before the full benefits are realised. In China, for example, within 20 years since the introduction of HBV immunisation, mother -to-child transmission has been cut by 97 percent ; 120 million new HBV infections and 28 million chronic infect ions have been averted.9 Thirty y ears after the introduction of a HepB immunisation programme for newborns in Taiwan, infant fulminant hepatitis mortality and, in those aged 5 to 29 years, chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma mortality had all decreased by more than 90 perce nt.10 The world can be divided into regions with high (8 percent and over), high -moderate (5-7 percent ), low -moderate (2 -4 percent ) and low (less than 2 percent ) prevalence of chronic infection, defined as the presence of HBsAg in serum.11, 12 In regions with a high prevalence of chronic infection, the lifetime risk of exposure to HBV is almost 80 percent , with most infections occurring in the rst decade of life . The Pacic Islands and most of Asia (except Japan and India) are high -prevalence regions. Other high -prevalence regions include Sub -Saharan Africa and Latin America.12 In contrast, in countries with a low HBsAg prevalence, the lifetime risk of HBV exposure is less than 20 percent , with most infections acquired in adulthood. New Zealand has a l ow overall prevalence of hepatitis B carriage but contains certain populations with high prevalence (see section 9.3.2 below). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 205 9.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Before the introduction of HBV immunisation in New Zealand, HBV transmission was common among preschool and school -aged children. The exact mode of transmission is uncertain, but is thought to be related to close contact. In the eastern Bay of Plenty region almost half of the population were infected by age 15 years.13, 14 Even after the introduction of universal HepB in 1988 (see Appendix 1 ), there were regions in New Zealand where children were still at risk of HBV infection due to poor immunisation coverage rates.15, 16, 17 Acute HBV infection Only acute hepatitis B is a notifiable disease in New Zealand; notification rates do not describe the burden of chronic HBV infections. The HBV notification rate in 2019 was 0.6 per 100,000 populati on (28 cases), similar to the 2018 rate (0.7 per 100,000, 33 cases). The highest notification rate was in the 30 -39 years age group (1.1 per 100,000) followed by 50 -59 years and 70 years and over (both 0.8 per 100,000). The notification rate was higher for males (0.9 per 100,000) than for females (0.3 per 100,000) (ESR, 8 June 2020). Ethnicity was recorded for all cases. The Mori (1.3 per 100,000) ethnic group had the highest hepatitis B notification rate followed by the Asian (0.7 per 100,000) ethnic group. The most common reported risk factors were overseas travel, migration and sexual contact with a confirmed case or carrier. Hepatitis B notications have declined from 609 cases in 1984 to 28 cases in 2019 (see Figure 9.1). While difficult to quantify accurately, the introduction of universal infant immunisation in 1988 has contributed to the dramatic decline in the number of newly notified cases of HBV i nfection. 206 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 9.1: Notifications of hepatitis B, 1997 -2019 Source: ESR For recent data on acute hepatitis B notifications, refer to the most recent notifiable disease annual reports from ESR (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/annual_surveilla nce.php ). Chronic HBV infection The Hepatitis Foundation of New Zealand reports that around 120,000 people in New Zealand are living with chronic HBV infection, around 50 percent are diagnosed, but only around 7,000 are being treated. Based on 2016 data, around 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year nationally. Mathematical modelling anticipated that the prevalence of chronic HBV infection would drop from 3.3 percent in 2016 to 2.4 percent by 2030, falling short of the elimination targets set by the WHO i n 2016.18 The National Hepatitis B Screening Programme found that between 1999 and 2002 in the North Island, the highest rates of chronic HBV infection were among Chinese (9.1 percent ), Pacific peoples (8.5 percent ) and M ori (5.8 percent ). Although Europeans were not specifically targeted in this screening programme, they have an estimated prevalence rate of 1 percent (higher than in Australia, North America and Europe), reflecting an increased risk of childhood horizontal transmission.19 A New Zealand -based modelling study estimated that until the year 2100, people with chronic HBV infection will continue to provide a source of infection to susceptible people.20 Increased immigration from high -prevalence countries in the Asia -Pacific region is also likely to influence HBV prevalence in New Zealand. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 207 Because people who acquire chronic HBV infection in childhood usually do n ot develop hepatocellular carcinoma until aged 40 years or older, the introduction of a universal HBV vaccination in 1988 is unlikely to have a significant effect on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma until approximately 2030. A retrospective labor atory data study of antenatal HBsAg tests from the Midlands region (Bay of Plenty, Eastern Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Rotorua) between 1997 and 2009 found a declining prevalence of HBV infection. This decrease was seen across all age groups, but was most m arked in antenatal tests of women aged under 20 years, due to receipt of funded HepB in childhood.21 A long -term follow -up study in New Zealand showed that horizontally acquired HBV infection during childhood in Mori and Pacific peoples correlates with increased rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and li ver-related mortality.22 This study emphasises the import ance of early protection of the infant with vaccination. Strategy for prevention In 1988 New Zealand was one of the first countries to introduce universal infant hepatitis B immunisation. As of 31 December 2019, 93 percent of New Zealand children aged 2 y ears had completed a primary course of HepB, which confers lifelong immunity in approximately 95 percent of those vaccinated. 9.4 Vaccines 9.4.1 Available vaccines The specific monovalent and combination HepB vaccines licensed (approved for use) and available (mark eted) in New Zealand contain recombinant HBsAg per dose; does not contain a preservative. Other components and residuals include aluminium hydroxide, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate dehydrate, sodium GSK): hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (see section 6.4.1 for more information). 208 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Other vaccines HepA -HepB (hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine): Twinrix and Twinrix Junior (GSK) (see also section 8.4.1). 9.4.2 Efficacy and effectiveness Clinical trials in high -risk groups have shown a vaccine efcacy of 85 -95 percent for HepB vaccines.8 See also section 15.4.2 for about the -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. Immunogenicity Serum anti -HBs antibody 10 IU/L, measured 1 -2 months after immunisation, is considered by WHO as a correlate of long -term protection.8 In the primary care setting, individuals who have had a documented seroconversion after three injections are expected to have lifelong immunity with no need for further boosters, even if circulating antibody is subsequently not detectable. Smoking, obesity, HIV infection and chronic disease (including renal failure) all reduce vaccine efficacy, but age is the primary factor affecting the response. At least 98 percent of infants, 9 5 percent of children and 90 percent of adolescents develop protective levels of antibody after three doses of vaccine. Some non -responders will not produce adequate antibody levels to the initial vaccination course, but most respond to further vaccine dos es. However, some people are persistent non -responders. Persistent non -responders often have an impaired immune system, such as organ transplant recipients and those with HIV infection or chronic disease, including advanced cirrhosis, renal failure or those undergoing haemodialysis. A small percentage (approximately 2 -3 percent ) of the immunocompetent population may also fail to elicit an antibody response. High -risk individuals who fail to respond adequately are recommended further vaccinations (see section 9.5.7). Effectiveness of birth dose given to babies born to HBsAg -positive mothers Infants vaccinated at birth born to infected mothers were 3.5 times less likely to be infected with HBV than those who did not receive a birth vaccination.8, 23 For babies of HBeAg -positive mothers, controlled trials have shown that vaccine at birth provides 75 percent protection from infection, while administration of HBIG in addition to vaccination provides 85 -95 percent protection against transmission.23, 24 Transmission following HBIG/HepB prophylaxis at birth almost exclusively occurs in HBeAg -positive mothers with high HBV DNA levels (above 2 x 105 IU/ml or 1 million copies/ml) and/or HBsAg levels above 4 -4.5 log 10 IU/ml .25 In this situation, administration of tenofovir (an antiviral agent) to the mother during the last trimester is recommended and funded. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 209 Duration of immunity The development of anti -HBs antibodies after a primary vaccination course (three injections and seroc onversion) indicates development of immune memory. The quantity of antibody in serum is thought to determine the length of time the antibody titre can be detected in the blood, although any reading 10 IU/L post -vaccination course is considered protective.26, 27 Children who are given booster doses up to 12 years after the primary series show strong anamnestic (secondary) responses, indicating that booster is unnecessary once a seroprotective level is reached after the three -dose primary vaccination course.26, 27 Long -term protection from clinical infection, despite loss of detectable neutralising antibody, is thought to reflect a strong ce llular memory immune response following HBV vaccination.28 Even though a large proportion of vaccine recipients may have undetecta ble antibody within seven years of vaccination, there is evidence from Germany,28 Taiwan,29 Alaska30 and Hawaii31 that boosters of HepB are unnecessary following completion of infant immunisation. Sustained immune memory, including circulating memory B and T cells, and long -term protection ha ve been shown 20 -30 years after complete primary immunisation of immune competent adults in the absence of natural or artificial boosting.24 In general, vaccine recipients who are subsequently infected with HBV do not develop clinical illness but may have anti -HBc present in plasma.1 Impact on chronic HBV infection In all populations, where it has been measured, immunisation has led to a dramatic drop in HBV chronic infection.32 For example, chronic HBV infection dropped from 16 percent to zero in Alaska as a result of 96 percent immunisation coverage. In Taiwan, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma also decreased as a result of the immunisation programme in children.33, 34 Adolescents and adults who were o ffered universal HBV vaccination in infancy had more than 75 percent lower prevalence of HBV infection and anti -HBc prevalence than those for whom immunisation was unavailable.35 9.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) (available not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and HepB vaccines should be stored in the dark. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the supplied container of the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the via l containing the Hib -PRP pellet. After adding the vaccine to the pellet, the mixture should be shaken until the pellet is completely dissolved. Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kep t for up to eight hours at 21\u00b0C. 9.4.4 Dosage and administration DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Each 0.5 mL dose of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) vaccine contains 10 g of HBsAg, and is administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). HepB The dose of HepB vaccine varies according to the vaccine manufacturer, the age of the individual and/or their health status (see section 9.5 for recommendations): Engerix -B 20 g (GSK): 20 g mL Engerix -B paediatric 10 g (GSK): 10 g per 0.5 mL . HepB vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection. It can be also administered by subcutaneous injection, if indicated for bleeding disorders (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines Hepatitis B vaccines may be given at the same time as all other vaccines on the Schedule, including measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. If a course of vaccine is interrupted, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses (see Appendix 2 ).

Consider combined Hep A and B vaccination for travellers to these regions. 9.5.1 Usual childhood schedule A primary course of hepatitis B vaccination is given as three doses of DTaP -IPV- HepB/Hib at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months ( Table 9.5). If a course of immunisation is interrupted for any reason, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses (see section 9.5.3 and Appendix 2 ). Table 9.5: Usual childhood schedule for hepatitis B -containing vaccine (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series Preterm infants of HBsAg -negative women Some low birthweight or preterm infants may have a reduced response to HepB vaccine at birth.37 However, by th e chronological age of 1 month, all medically stable preterm infants, regardless of initial birthweight or gestational age, respond to HepB as well as term and larger infants.38 Because New Zealand 's Schedule starts at age 6 weeks, low birthweight and preterm infants are expected to respond to HepB content in the DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. (See also sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.) Infants with liver or renal disease HepB vaccine is funded for liver or kidney transplant patients and for dialysis patients. For infants requiring transplants, see 'Solid organ transplanta tion' in section 4.3.10 . For infants undergoing dialysis, see 'Chronic kidney disease ' in section 4.4. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 213 9.5.2 Infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers The routine schedule for these infants is a birth dose of monovalent HepB plus HBIG, then three routine doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months. All pregnant women should receive antenatal screening for hepatitis B infection by testing for HBsAg. Infants of HBsAg -positive mothers are to be notified at birth using the form HE1446: Consent for hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin and notification to the Medical Officer of Health , available from www.healthed.govt.nz or the local authorised health education resource provider or public health unit. Infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers should receive: 100-110 IU HBIG neonatal, at or as close as possible to birth a birth dose of HepB which shoul d be given at or as clo se as possible to birth (preferably within 12 hours). If HBIG and/or HepB is inadvertently omitted, administer as soon as the omission is recognised. HBIG can be administered up to seven days post -delivery. If there is a delay for longer than seven days, s eek specialist advice. These infants should then continue as per the Schedule at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months. Serological testing is required at 9 months of age (see below). The vitamin K injection may also be given at the same time, in the same l imb as the HBIG, but not at the same site. Occasionally women have not been tested for their HBsAg status during the antenatal period. If a woman 's HBsAg status is unknown at the time of delivery, the baby should be given HepB at the time of delivery whil e waiting for the result of an urgent HBsAg test on the mother. If she is found to be HBsAg positive, the baby should be given HBIG as soon as possible, up to seven days post -delivery. Immunoprophylaxis is most effective when given within 12 hours of deliv ery.38 Subsequent vaccine doses are given as per the Schedule. It is essential to take blood to determine whether the baby has seroconverted (anti-HBs positive) or has become infected despite immunoprophylaxis (HBsAg positive), or is neither infected nor immune (ie, HBsAg negative and anti -HBs negative). Testing should be performed at 9 months of age to avoid detection of anti-HBs from HBIG administered during infancy and to ma ximise the likelihood of detecting late onset HBV infections.38 Infants of HBsAg -positive mothers should be placed on a practice recall system to have their blood tested at 9 months of age. Check at the 12 -month immunisation event to ensure that testing has occurred. The serology results should be interpreted as in Figure 9.2. 214 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 9.2: Management of an infant of an HBsAg -positive woman Screen all women in early pregnancy for hepatitis B carriage Woman is HBsAg positive No See section 9.5.1: 'Usual childhood schedule ' Yes All HBsAg -positive pregnant women should also be tested for HBeAg and should have HBV DNA measured. The results should be discussed with a specialist or the woman should immediately be referred to a specialist for ongoing care. Give the baby hepatitis B protection as follows. At age Action to be taken Birth Give HBIG 100 -110 IU and HepB 6 -IPV-HepB/Hib 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib 9 months Take a blood test to check for hepatitis B infection (HBsAg) and for vaccine -induced immunity (anti -HBs). If HBsAg is negative and anti -HBs level is 10 IU/L at age 9 months, immunity is proven. If HB sAg is positive, the infant has become infected despite prophylaxis: refer to an appropriate specialist. If HBsAg is negative and anti -HBs level is <10 IU/L at age 9 months, give a further 3 doses of HepB at least 4 weeks apart. Recheck serology 4 weeks af ter the last dose. If there is no seroconversion after the third further dose of HepB (ie, if anti-HBs is still <10 IU/L), discuss with a specialist. All other vaccines should be administered as per the Schedule. Neonatal HBIG plus vaccine will fail to prevent vertical HBV transmission in up to 20 percent of infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers with serum HBV DNA levels greater than 108 IU/mL (or 2 x107 copies/mL). These mothers are usually young, with normal ala nine transaminase, and are HBeAg -positive. If the mother 's HBV DNA level is greater than 200,000 IU/mL25, 39, 40, administration of tenofovir (an antiviral agent) during the last trimester is funded. The number of such high -risk pregnancies appears to be increasing in this country as a result of the immigration of young Asian women of childbearing age, of whom approximately 8 percent are HBsAg -positive with the majority of those also HBeAg - positive. In contrast, the number of HBsAg -positive Mori and Pacific women of childbearing age has decreased markedly due to infant vaccination. In addition, most HBsAg -positive Mori and Pacific women are HB eAg-negative, with lower HBV DNA levels (below 108 IU/mL). Infants born to mothers who received oral antiviral therapy for chronic HBV must still receive the recommended neonatal HBIG/vaccine schedule. All other vaccines are administered as per the Schedu le. See Appendix 6 and section 9.8.1 for more information about passive immunisation and HBIG. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 215 Preterm of HBsAg -positive women Preterm and low birthweight infants of HBsAg -positive women should be managed as above, regardless of birthweight or gestation. 9.5.3 Catch -ups for children and adolescents HepB is recommended and funded for everyone aged und er 18 years. If HepB is not given during the rst year of life, three doses of vaccine are recommended. For adolescents aged 11 -15 years, an alternative two -dose hepatitis B catch -up schedule may be considered using the monovalent HepB with the second dose given four to six months after the first. See Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules. Children and adolescents with liver or kidney disease HepB vaccine is funded for liver or kidney transplant patients (recommend six months post-transplant) and for dialysis patients. See Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4 for serological testing and vaccina tion recommendations. If non -immune, children aged under 16 years should receive three doses of HepB; those aged 16 years and older should receive four doses of HepB given at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months. If there is an inadequate immune response to the initial three -dose HepB series (see Figure 9.4), give a further three doses, as appropriate for age. See also 'Solid organ transplantation ' in section 4.3.10 , 'Chronic kidney disease ' in section 4.4 and 'Chronic liver disease ' in section 4.5. 9.5.4 Eligible adults aged 18 years and older Table 9.6: Hepatitis B vaccine schedules for eligible adults aged 18 years and older Who Vaccine Dose Volume (mL) Number of doses Schedule Dialysis patients, liver or kidney transplant patients HepB 40 \u00b5g 1.0 3 0, 1 and 6 months HIV patients HepB 20 \u00b5g 1.0 4 0, 1, 2 and 12 months Other eligible adults (see Table 9.4) HepB 20 \u00b5g 1.0 3 0, 1 and 6 months 216 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Adult dialysis or adult liver or kidney transplant patients These adults may have a reduced response to HepB,36, 41 so three higher do ses (40 \u00b5g per dose) are recommended and funded. See section 9.5.7 for information about post -vaccination serology. (See also 'Solid organ transplantation ' in section 4.3.10 and recommendations provided in IMAC factsheet 'Immunisation for adults pre -dialysis, on dialysis or pre -/post -kidney transplant ' available at immune.org.nz .) Adult HIV patients Adult HIV patients should receive four doses of HepB (20 \u00b5g per dose) at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months. (See also 'HIV infection ' in section 4.3.12 and recommendations provided in IMAC factsheet Immunisation for adults with HIV infection available from immune.org.nz .) Other eligible adults The optimal dosing regime is three doses of 20 \u00b5g HepB given at 0, 1 and 6 months. See the manufacturer 's data sheet for sub -optimal accelerated HepB schedules if dosing is time constrained. For other eligible adults, see Table 4.7, 'Other special groups ' in section 4.6. 9.5.5 Pregnancy and breastfeeding HepB may be given during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Acute HBV infection in pregnant women may result in severe acute hepatitis for the mother, with associ ated increased risk of fetal loss or neonatal infection. Vaccination should not be withheld from a susceptible pregnant woman at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis B (eg, the sexual partner of an injecting drug user, or known infected male). 9.5.6 (Re)vaccin ation Hepatitis B -containing vaccines are funded for vaccination and revaccination of eligible children, as follows. See also sections 4.2 and 4.3. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 217 DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) An additional four doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib are funded for vaccination or revaccination of children aged under 10 years: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib are funded for children aged under 10 years receiving solid organ transplantation. Monovalent HepB HepB is funded for children aged under 18 years who are considered not to have achieved a positive serology and require additional vaccination. 9.5.7 Serological testing Serological testing is not routinely recommended - immunisation is highly effective. Most people with documented evidence of three HepB vaccinations will be immune for life. Unnecessary testing leads to unnecessary extra vaccination. Infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers and some individuals who require protection in relation to their employment (eg, health care professionals) require post -vaccination serology. Where there is concern about immunity follow Figure 9.3. 218 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Screening for chronic infection Screening for the antigen (HBsAg) is useful where there is increased likelihood of the individual already being infected. The Hepatitis Foundation of New Zealand recommends that the following individuals are most at risk of HBV:42 people of Mori, Pacific or Asian ethnicity, un less fully vaccinated with HepB vaccine as an infant people born in an area of high hepatitis B endemicity, including Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa, the Middle East, southern Europe or the northern or eastern parts of New Zealand 's North Island people born to a mother or who have a close family member who has chronic HBV infection people who live with someone who has HBV people who have had unprotected sexual contact with an HBV -infected person people who have ever injected drugs people who have received a tattoo using unsterile equipment. Screening for HBsAg is also part of routine antenatal care (see section 9.5.2). All HBsAg -positive individuals should be offered follow -up under the Hepatitis Foundation Hepatitis B Follow -up Programme to enable early diagnosis and treatment of the complications of severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Vaccination is funded for household or sexual contacts o f HBsAg -positive people (ie, contacts of people with acute or chronic HBV infection). To confirm chronic HBV status, repeat testing after 6 months and if still positive, refer patient to The Hepatitis Foundation. Serological testing for high -risk groups Serological testing is not routinely recommended - immunisation is highly effective. Serological testing is only indicated in high -risk groups (see Table 9.7). These high-risk groups are at higher risk of exposure to HBV, at higher risk of having severe disease or are more susceptible to disease. A flow diagram (Figure 9.3) is included to assist in deciding whether pre - and/or post -vaccination serological testing is indicated. Figure 9.3 may be used for any individual aged 12 months or old er, such as for the management of blood and body fluid exposures, or when an adult presents to primary care. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 219 Table 9.7: Individuals at high -risk of hepatitis B infection, for whom serological testing is indi cated Household or sexual contacts of HBsAg -positive patients (ie, patients with acute or chronic HBV infection) Current or recent injecting drug users Individuals who change sexual partners frequently (eg, sex workers) Immunocompromised individuals, including HIV -positive patients Following non -consensual sexual intercourse Individuals prior to planned immunosuppressive therapies for 28 days or more Individuals following immunosuppressive therapies for 28 days or more Solid organ and post -HSCT patients Following percutaneous injury (eg, needle -stick injury) Adults at occupational -related risk (see section 4.8) Individuals with haemophilia and other regular recipients of blood products Inmates of custodial institutions Individuals with developmental disabilities People with chronic disease (eg, chronic renal failure requiring haemodial ysis, or chronic liver di sease) Migrants from HBV endemic regions (where HBsAg prevalence is 2 percent )* * See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for countries with an HBsAg prevalence 2% (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/ travel -related -infectious -diseases/hepatitis -b). and B vaccination for individuals trave lling to these regions. 220 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 9.3: Flow diagram for serological testing for hepatitis B a. HBIG may be recommended for non -immune individuals. See Table 9.8. b. Do not count any birth doses of HepB vaccine. See Table 9.4 for the list of funded conditions for HepB vaccine. c. See the manufacturer 's data sheet for accelerated HepB schedules . d. Haemodialysis patients need annual testing and boosting if required. The non -responder protocol Most vaccine recipients will devel op a high anti -HBs titre, usually greater than 100 IU/L, which usually wanes over time. Fully vaccinated individuals (ie, those who have received three documented doses of HepB) who have at any time had anti -HBs 10 IU/L do not need any booster doses, even if antibodies subsequently wane to undetectable levels, which occurs in most individuals by seven years after the last vaccination. Adults have been shown to have an anamnestic antibody and cellular immune response to a HepB dose given 20 -30 years after the primary immunisation.24 If exposed to HBV, they will have a secondary anamnestic immune response that will prevent replication of the virus.1, 43 Note: Some laboratories may require a higher ant i-HBs antibody level for proof of immunity. Please follow the testing laboratory 's interpretative comments. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 221 If a high -risk individual does not achieve a titre of 10 IU/L by four weeks following one HepB dose, they should be considered a non -responder and follow the non - responder protocol ( Figure 9.4). Figure 9.4: The non -responder protocol Individual is high -risk (see Table 8.7 ), has received three documented doses of HepB plus a booster dose and has an anti -HBs <10 IU/L: Complete a second course of three HepB vaccine doses. Repeat the serology four weeks after the final HepB vaccine dose. If anti-HBs 10 IU/L, assume immunity. No further action is required. A third course of three doses of 40\u00b5g HepB vaccine (ie , two injections per visit of Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g) is advised for high risk individuals who fail to respond to a second course.44 Alternativ ely, there is also some evidence that using a double dose of HAV -HepB (Twinrix) at 0, 1 and 6 months can correct this hyporesponsiveness, using the bystander carrier effect of the HAV component,45 but this is not funded. Repeat serology four weeks after final HepB dose. If, after the third course of three HepB vaccine, a person has not achieved anti-HBs 10 IU/L, they should be considered a persistent non -responder to vaccination. Persistent non -responders with no immunocompromise who have completed the primary series and further courses of three vaccine doses should be monitored for wild -type disease, but literature reports disease from vaccine failures are rare. They should be considered 'unprotected ' against hepatitis B and advised to minimise the chance of exposures. Parenteral or mucosa l exposure to HBV requires HBIG within 72 hours. Intradermal injections to correct this hypo -responsiveness have been used in the past, but they are technically difficult and not recommended. 9.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. The only specic contraindication to HepB is anaphylaxis following a previous dose, or individuals with a history of allergic reactions to yea st or any of the vaccine 's components. Immunisation of previously infected subjects is wasteful, but not harmful. See section 15.6 for contraindications and precau tions to DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. 222 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 9.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See section 15.7 for potential responses and AEFIs with DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. 9.7.1 Potential respo nses Minor side -effects - including local tenderness and redness, nausea, diarrhoea, general malaise and fever - are more common in adults than in children and, except for local reactions, occur at rates close to those seen with a placebo. Minor reactions reported after receiving the vaccine include a temperature >37.7\u00b0C in 1 -6 percent ; pain in 3-29 percent ; and erythema, headache or swelling in 3 percent of vaccine recipients. 9.7.2 AEFIs Allergic reactions have been reported but are rare. Anaphylaxis following vaccination is extremely rare (estimated to be 1.1 cases per million doses).46 A number of studies have examined and failed to nd disease eve nts linked to hepatitis B immunisation.47 These studies have documented no increased risk of multiple sclerosis,48, 49, 50 diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome,51 encephalomyelitis or hair loss.52 Rarely, transient thrombocytopenia53 and myalgia and arthralgia54, 55 have been repor ted after HepB vaccination. 9.8 Public health measures The elimination of HBV transmission is now a realistic public health goal7, 56 especially with the proven effectiveness and safety record of HepB.57 Achievement of this goal is being facilitated by the implementation of triple elimination strategies in the Western Pacific Region to prevent mother -to-child transmission of HIV, HBV and syphilis,8 and the use of birth dosing HepB regimes, either universally or as directed. It is important to ensure vaccination programmes are maintained for the at-risk populations, especially babies of mothers with chronic hepatitis B infection. It is a legal requirement that all cases of acute hepatitis B infection be notied to the local medical ofcer of health. Babies born to HBsAg -positive mothers should be notified at birth. The prevention of perinatal transmission is covered in section 9.5.2. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 223 9.8.1 Passive immunisation HBIG is prepared from donated blood plasma and contains high levels of anti -HBs antibody (see Appendi x 6). It is given after exposure to HBV and provides passive anti - HBs antibody protection against acute an d chronic HBV disease. HBIG prophylaxis should be given in combination with the HepB to confer both passive and active immunity after exposure. The efficacy of HBIG alone in preventing clinical hepatitis B infection is about 75 percent in adults, but the protection lasts only for a few months.1 Whenever immediate protection is required, immunisation with a vaccine should be combined with simultaneous administration of HBIG at a different site. It has been shown that passive immunisation with HBIG does not suppres s the active immune response to vaccination. A single dose of HBIG is sufcient (usually 400 IU for adults, 100-110 IU for newborns).58 If infection has already occurred at the time of the rst immunisation, virus replication is unlikely to be inhibited completely, but severe illness and, more importantly, the development of chronic HBV infection may be prevented, particularly in the infa nts of HBsAg -positive mothers. The management of contacts is summarised in Table 9.8. Table 9.8: Management of contact s of hepatitis B cases Contact Serological testing of contact (HBsAg, anti -HBs, anti - HBc, IgM and IgG) Immunoglobulin (if within 7 days of onset of case 's symptoms) Immunisation Any sexual contact, including protected sex Yes Yes, immediately after blood taken Yes, immediately after blood taken Household, mucosal or percutaneous Yes Yes, if serology negative Yes, if serology negative Other Yes No Yes, if serology negative Source: Ministry of Health . 2012. Communicable Disease -disease -control -manual (accessed 30 June 2020) . For more details on control measures , refer to the 'Hepatitis B ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual ). 224 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 9.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet See section 15.9 for variations from the DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) data sheet. Ministry of Health advises that two doses Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g, given four to six months apart, may be given to adolescents ag ed 11 -15 years. The manufacturer 's data sheet recommends three doses of 10 \u00b5g given at 0, 1 and 6 months, but in circumstances where compliance may not be assured, giving 20 \u00b5g per dose increases the proportion of recipients protected after the first and s econd doses. Although the Ministry of Health and the data sheet recommend 0.5 ml Engerix -B 10 \u00b5g (paediatric formulation) for neonates born to HBV infected mothers, where the paediatric presentation is unavailable, the data sheet advises that Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g can be given to children from birth up to the age of 10 years. The Ministry of Health recommends giving three doses of 40 ug HepB (ie , two doses of Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g per visit) to be given 0, 1, and 6 months for adult renal dialysis patients, liver or kidney transplant patients. For adults with HIV, four doses of Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g is recommended given at 0, 1, 2 and 12 months. The data sheet advises four doses of 40 \u00b5g (ie, two doses for Engerix -B 20 \u00b5g per visit) given at 0, 1, 2 and 6 months for chronic haemodialysis patients and other individuals who have an impairment of their immune system.

Period of communicability HPV infection is very common, with initial infection occurring soon after sexual debut and a lifetime risk of over 80%. Recurrent infection and co-infection with multiple types are possible. Incidence and burden of disease HPV is linked to almost all cervical cancers and to a bout 69% of vulvar, 75% of vaginal, of oropharyngeal Funded vaccine HPV9 (Gardasil 9) is a recombinant subunit vaccine containing virus -like particles (VLPs). HPV9 contains HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 5 2 and 58. Dose, presentation, route 0.5 mL per dose. Pre-filled syringe. Intramuscular injection. Funded indications and recommended schedules 2 doses, at 0 and 6 -12 months for children aged 14 years and under. 3 doses, at 0, 2 and 6 months, for individuals: aged 15 -26 years inclusive aged 9 -26 years inclusive: - with confirmed HIV infection or - who are transplant (including stem cell) patients An additional dose for individuals aged 9 -26 years post -chemotherapy. NB: Individuals who were previously f ully vaccinated with HPV4 are not eligible for HPV9. Vaccine effectiveness The incidence of HPV infection, precancerous lesions and genital warts is significantly reduced in immunised populations (in women and men). There is evidence for herd immunity (reductions in HPV infection and genital warts in unimmunised populations). Precautions and special considerations HPV vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women; however, enquiring about the possibility of pregnancy is not necessary before vaccination. Potential responses to vaccine Syncope (fainting) and other immunisation -related stress reactions are associated with giving vaccine to adolescents. Public health measures Measures for cancer prevention (see section 10.8): HPV immunisation. Regular cervical screening for women. Safer sex approaches. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 229 10.1 Virology and the causal link to cancer Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses from the Papillomavirus family. There are about 150 different HPV serotypes. They vary in their preference for infecting squamous epithelium at different sites, thereby causing the various types of HPV infection (eg, common, palma r, plantar or anogenital). More than 40 HPV types can infect the anogenital tract.1, 2 Data from the US cancer registry indicates that HPV is causally associated with almost all cervical cancers, about 69 percent of vulvar, 75 percent of vaginal, 63 percent of penile, 90 percent of anal and 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers (see Table 10.1).3 Based on their causal link to cancer, HPVs are divided into low -risk and high -risk types. There are approximately 12 high -risk types, which include 16, 18 and types 31, 33, 52, 58 and 45 that are genetically related to 16 and 18.4 Types 16 and 18 are most frequently associated with cervical cancer but are also causally associated with other cancers. In the US, HPV types 16 and 18 are estimated to cause 66 percent of invasive cervical cancers, 80 percent of anal, 49 percent of vulvar, 55 percent of vaginal, 48 percent of penile and 60 percent of oropharyngeal cancers annually ( Table 10.1).3 Low-risk types (especially types 6 and 11) are predominantly associated with non - malignant lesions, such as genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. 230 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 10.1: Average ann ual percentage of cancer cases attributable to HPV, by anatomic site and sex, United States, 2008 -2010 Anatomic sitec Cancers attributable to any HPVa, b Cancers attributable to HPV 16, 18a, b Cancers attributable to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, 58a, b % % % 90.6d 66.2 14.7 63.3 50.8 9.5 men 72.4 63.4 4.4 a.

International Classification of Diseases the soft palate, walls of pharynx, tonsils and HPV is accepted to be a necessary factor in the causal pathway to invasive cervical cancer, HPV is not always detected in tu mour specimens from women who receive a diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer due to a variety of reasons, including misclassification of tissue specimens as cervix, quality of tissue specimens, assay sensitivity, and a small proportion of HPV -negative, ce rvical cancers.

Journal of the National Cancer Institute 107(6), DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djv086 Table 4. 10.2 Clinical features 10.2.1 Infection Infection results from predominantly sexual skin -to-skin contact with a person with HPV infection. Transmission in the genital region may occur even when condoms are used and does not necessarily require penetrative intercourse. HPV may also be transmitted perinatally from mother to newborn baby. Clinically apparent warts are probably more infectious than subclinical infection. The virus penetrates micro -abrasions in the epithelium to reach the basal epithelial cells , where it causes the infected cells to produce proteins that delay cellular maturation. Continued replication of these infected cells in the intermediate epithelial layer, followed by virus replication in the superficial epithelial layer, results in the c ellular overgrowth typical of warts. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 231 For most people, HPV infection is transient and becomes undetectable by DNA testing within 6 to 12 months, but in some cases, HPV infection remains latent and may reactivate years later. As it is difficult to detect HP V in its latent stage, it is impossible to know whether the immune system can completely clear the virus or whether, in some cases, undetectable latent virus is capable of later re -emerging. Acquisition of HPV Infection with oncogenic serotypes of HPV is common, with an estimated 70 -80 percent of sexually active individuals becoming infected at some stage during their life. Initial infection occurs soon after sexual debut. Most episodes of infection become undetectable by DNA testing within two years of acquisition; the average duration of infection is one year. Previous infection does not necessarily create long -term immune memory so does not prevent future re -infection with the same HPV type. At any one time, approximately 10 percent of women have at least one HPV infection. The HPV serotypes that cause more prolonged infection tend to be those that more frequently result in the development of histological abnormalities.5, 6 Two US studies found that incidence of genital HPV infection was higher in men than for similar cohorts of young women. In university students (age 18 -20 years), the cumulative incidence of first -time infection at 24 months was 32 percent (95% CI: 28.0-37.1) for females compared with 62.4 percent (95% CI: 52.6 -72.2) in heterosexually active male students. Frequent new sexual partners and a history of smoking were associated with an elevated risk of H PV acquisition for both.7, 8 There are differences between the sexes in the immune response to HPV. A smaller proportion of men are HPV -seropositive, and men have lower antibody titres than women.9 In contrast to women, for whom the risk for HPV acquisition increases with age through the early 20s and then decreases, studies have demonstrated HPV prevalence in men seems to peak at slightly older ages and remains const ant or decreases slightly with increasing age, suggesting persistent HPV infection or a higher rate of re -infection.10, 11 Men who have sex with men, especially those who are HIV -positive, are at higher risk for HPV infection, anal cancer and high -grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia.12 In teenage men who have sex with men (aged 16 -20 years), early and high per -partner HPV transmission occu rs between men soon after their first sexual experiences.13 Individuals who are immunocompromised (due to medical conditions or treatment) are more likely to develop a persistent HPV infection and to subsequently progress to HPV-related disease.14, 15 Those with confirmed HIV infection are more at risk of HPV infection.16 HPV is less likely to become undetectable in individuals coinfected with HIV.17, 18 A direct relationship has been identified between low CD4+ cell count and an increased risk of cervical cancer in HIV -infected women.19 232 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 10.2.2 Cervical cancer HPV rapidly becomes undetectable in the first 6 -12 months of acquisition of infection, with 80 -90 percent undetectable by two years. Following this, a very sm all fraction of persistent infection progresses to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); these are non - invasive precancerous lesions, which are categorised as either low - or high -grade CIN. Invasive cervical cancer occurs when the lesions invade the ce rvical tissue, and is graded from stage I to IV, depending on how far the cancer has spread beyond the cervix into surrounding tissue or organs. Cervical cancer does not usually develop until decades after acquisition of infection with an oncogenic (cance r-causing) HPV serotype. Persistent HPV infection is detected in almost all women with cervical cancer.20 HPV infection is essential, but not sufficient by itself, for the development of cervical cancer. Other factors have been described that may be associated with HPV persistence and high -grade lesions including smoking, early onset sexual activity, older age, contraceptive use, multiple sexual partners and genetic factors.21, 22 10.2.3 Oropharyngeal and other cancers The clinical features of other HPV -associated cancers and their precancerous lesions in the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions vary, and also depend on the anatomical site. The progression from HPV -associated precancer lesions to cancers in these sites is less well understood than the process in the cervix. Oropharyngeal cancers include cancers of the soft palate, the walls of the pharynx, the tonsils and the base of the tongue. The risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer are similar to those for cervical cancer, including the number of sexual partners, younger age at first sexual intercourse, practice of oral sex, history of genital warts and younger age.23 10.2.4 Genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis HPV 6 and 11 account for around 90 percent of all genital wart cases. Most warts cases are self -limited, although some may persist for several years. Persistence is more common in patients with impaired cell -mediated immunity.2 Perinatal transmission of HPV (usually types 6 or 11) can cause laryngeal infection in infants, which in rare cases can result in recurrent res piratory papillomatosis in children. Respiratory papillomatosis is characterised by multiple warty growths on the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract, which can cause hoarseness and significantly obstruct the airways and require repeated surgery.2 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 233 10.3 Epidemiology 10.3.1 Global burden of disease HPV is an important carcinogenic infection. The 12 high -risk types are reported to be the second most common infectious cause of cancer worldwide after Helicobacter pylori .24 It has been estimated that 4.5 percent of all cancers (630,000 new cancer cases per year) are attributable to HPV; over 70 percent are attributable to HPV types 16 and 18, and 90 percent to types contained within the H PV9 vaccine. The greatest burden is in India and sub -Saharan Africa, where there is limited access to both screening and vaccination, and more than 20 percent of cancers in women are attributable to HPV infection.25 Onset of sexual activity Most HPV infections occur within the first two y ears of onset of sexual activity; more than 40 percent of individuals become infected during this period. The first sexual relationship carries a substantial risk.26 Cervical cancer Cervical cancer is the third cause of female cancer and cancer deaths in the world and is the second most common cause of female cancer and cancer deaths in women aged 15-44 years; the estimated incidence rate of cervical cancer cases attributable to HPV across Oceania was 10.2 (range 6.0 -29.1) per 100,000 across all ages; the estimated annual mortality was 4.8 (range 1.7 -19.0) per 100,000 in 2018.27 Persistent HPV infection can lead to high -grade CIN. Approximately one -third of CIN3 progresses to invasive cervical cancer within 10 -20 years. A 2010 study reported that more than one -quarter (26.7 percent ; 95% C I: 21.1 -31.8) of those with persistent HPV16 and nearly one in five (19.1 percent ; 95% CI: 10.4 -27.3) of those with persistent HPV18 developed CIN3 or cancer within 12 years.28 A multi -national study across 38 countries found HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 in 85 percent of invasive cervical cancer cases, 71 percent (95% CI: 70 -72) of cervical adenocarcinomas were positive for HPV16 and 18 and 94 percent (95% CI: 92 -96) were positive for Other HPV -related cancers Oncogenic HPV types are linked to other cancers in women and men, including vulval, vaginal, penile, anal and oropharyngeal cancers (see Table 10.1). 234 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Anal cancers Anal cancer remains relatively rare compared to other cancers, but the global incidence has increased among both men and women, particularly in high -income regions (the average worldwide incidence is 1 per 100,ooo population).27 Women have a higher incidence of anal cancer t han men. The incidence is highest among men who have sex with men, women with history of cervical or vulvar cancer, and immunosuppressed populations, including those who are HIV -infected and patients with a history of organ transplantation.27 Oropharyngeal cancers There has been an increase in the incidence of head and neck cancers over the past few decades. This increase is mainly due to an unexpected increase in HPV -related oropharyngeal cancers, primarily in males aged 40 -55 years with exposure to alcohol and tobacco.29 Most recent data suggest that around one -quarter of all oropharyngeal cancers are attributable to HPV infection; the most frequent type is HPV16.25, 27 (see Table 10.1). Vulval and vaginal cancer Vulval and vaginal cancers are rare worldwide, representing 4 percent and 2 percent of all gynaecological cancers. Incidence is highest in less developed countries .27 Genital warts Genital warts, which are most commonly due to infection with HPV6 or HPV11, have a prevalence of approximately 1 percent of adults in the US.30, 31 Scandinavian countries have reported rates as high as 10 percent .32 10.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Onset of sexual activity Data from the Youth '12 survey suggests that approximately 8 percent of New Zealand adolescents may have had sexual intercourse before the age of 13 years.33, 34 This increases to 24 percent by the age of 15 years and 46 percent by age 17 years. Compared to 2001, students were more likely to delay sexual debut in 2012 but less likely to use condoms and contraception consistently.35 Mori (OR 95% students used condoms less frequently than NZ European students; those from socioeconomically deprived communities (school decile 1) used condoms less frequently (OR 0.7; 95% CIs: 0.5 -0.9) than students from wealthier communities decile 10).35 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 235 Cervical cancer HPV prevalence in precancerous lesions and invasive cervical cancer The prevalence of HPV infection and distribution of HPV types among New Zealand women with his tologically confirmed CIN 2/336, 37 or invasive cervical cancer38 was broadly consistent with that seen inter nationally. During 2011 -2012, 97 percent (95% CI: 94 -98) of women with histologically confirmed CIN 2/3 were HPV -positive, and the prevalence of any high -risk HPV was 96 percent (95% CI: 91 -99).36 In wom en with histologically confirmed cervical cancer during 2004 88.5 percent (95% CI: 83.7 -92.4) were HPV -positive, the prevalence any high -risk HPV was 87.2 percent (95% CI: 82.2 -91.3).38 For both CIN 2/3 and invasive cervical cancer, the overall distribution of HPV types was similar in Mori and non -Mori women, with HPV16 being the most commonly detected HPV type in both groups.36, 38 Cervical cancer registrations and d eaths In 2018 (provisional), there were 191 new cervical cancer registrations, an increase from 164 in 2017.39 In 2017, the age -standardised registration rate was 6.0 per 100,000 population, similar to the 2016 rate (6.4 per 100,000). The registration rate for Mori women was 9.4 per 100,000, 1.7 times greater th an the rate for non -Mori women (5.4 per 100,000).39 There were 55 cervical cancer deaths in 2016. In 2014, when there were 46 deaths (1.4 deaths per 100,000 population) and the mortality rate for Mori women was 3.0 per 100,000, 2.7 times greater than fo r non -Mori women (1.1 per 100,000).40 Other HPV -related cancers The most recent New Zealand data available for other HPV -related cancers is from 2017 (see Table 10.2). Note that this data is for new cancer registrations only; the tumours have not been analysed for the HPV.

Oropharyngeal cancers A retrospective review of New Zealand cancer registry data for the period 1981 -2010 showed a rapid rise i n oropharyngeal cancers in men (mainly in those aged 40 years or older), particularly from 2005 onwards.41 The rate of oropharyngeal cancers was almost four times greater in men (1.87 per 100,000) than in women (0.47 per 100,000). The incidence rates for oral cavity cancer, which is generally associated with alcohol and tobacco consumption, remained relatively stable in both sexes during that time. (Note that this study included both oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancers.) A significant increase in HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer (OR 5.65; 95% CI: 2.60-12.30 was detected in biopsies taken during 1996 -1998 an d 2010 -2012 and occurring at a younger age (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33 -0.99 aged 61 or older and age 60 years or younger). Most cases attributable to HPV were HPV16 -positive (98.5 percent ); there was also one case each of HPV 33 and 35.42 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 237 Genital warts Many sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including genital warts, are not notifiable in New Zealand. ESR cautions that the number of cases of genital war ts reported through the clinic -based surveillance system likely underestimates the true burden of disease in New Zealand because a substantial percentage of STIs are diagnosed by other health care providers. Following the introduction of HPV4 vaccine to females in 2008 and the introduction of HPV9 vaccine for males and females in 2017, from 2008 to 2019 genital warts clinical case counts reported by sexual health clinics have decreased by 79.5 percent (from 3,681 to 756 cases) and case counts reported by family planning clinics decreased by 77.8 percent (from 573 to 127 cases) (ESR 26 June 2020). Since the introduction of the HPV vaccination programme, there have been decreases in the number of genital warts diagnoses in all ethnic groups in sexual health clinics and in all ethnic groups, except 'Other ', in family planning clinics. In sexual health clinics, the decrease was most notable in the 15 -19 years and 20 -24 years age groups, and there was a mod erate decrease in the 25 -29 years age group, in both sexes ( Figure 10.1). A marked decrease was following the extension of vaccination to males in 2017. From 2016 to 20 19, reported cases decreased by 50 percent (from 28 to 14 cases) in the younger males aged 15 -19 years and 45.3 percent (from 190 to 104 cases) in those aged 20 -24 years (ESR , 26 June 2020). A decrease in cases seen in older age groups suggests that immuni sation is also providing some herd immunity to unvaccinated individuals. A decline in the number of prescriptions for treating genital warts (imiquimod and podophyllum resin -based products) supports this evidence for a herd immunity effect.43 The largest decline was seen in women aged under 20 years. A study in Auckland sexual health clinics found a similar population effect in genital wart cases over five years following the introduction of HPV4 to women in 2009. A significant reduction in new genital warts cases was observed in a vaccine -eligible age group of females (aged <20 years), not observed in older age -groups (those aged over 20 years) or in males, not eligible to vaccination at that time. There was a smaller but not statistically significant decrease in genital warts cases in younger males (a ge <20 years) compared with that seen in older males.44 Figure 10.1: Number of genital warts (first presentation) in sexual health clinics, by sex and age group, 2008 -2019 Source: ESR 238 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 For further details of genital wart notifications, refer to the most recent STI quarterly and annual reports from ESR (available surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). 10.4 Vaccines 10.4.1 Available vaccines One HPV vaccine, HPV9 (Gardasil 9, Seqirus/MSD), is approved for use (registered) and is available for distribution (marketed) in New Zealand. HPV9 is registered for use in females aged 9 -45 years and in males aged 9 -26 years as a two -dose schedule in individuals aged 14 years and under, and as a three -dose schedule in older individuals and immunocompromised individual s from age 9 years. The vaccine contains HPV virus -like particles (VLPs), which are composed of the L1 protein (a component of the virus outer layer) aggregated into clumps that mimic the outer structure of the HPV virion. The VLPs do not contain viral DN A and are incapable of causing infection. The L1 proteins are produced by genetically engineered yeast cells. Funded HPV vaccine Each 0.5 mL dose of HPV9 vaccine (Gardasil 9, Seqirus/MSD) contains: VLP 500 \u00b5g of aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate. The vaccine does not contain any preservative or antibiotic s. Other vaccine HPV4 (Gardasil) was used prior to the introduction of HPV9 (Gardasil 9) in January 2017. See also section A1.3.4 in Appendix 1 for the history of HPV vaccines in New Zealand. In other countries, including Australia and in Europe, a bi -valent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, GSK) is available to protect against HPV type s 16 and 18 only. This vaccine is unavailable in New Zealand. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 239 10.4.2 Efficacy and effectiveness Most HPV vaccine clinical trials do not collect direct data about clinical outcomes, like cancer or precancer, for young adolescents, because it is unethical to collect samples from the cervix of vaccinated girls who are sexually na\u00efve and because precancerous lesions do not appear for years after the HPV infection has occurred. Also, since treatment is offered as precancers develop, progression to cervical cancer is rare even in those not vaccinated and requires a very long time for follow -up. Therefore, immunological bridging is used to infer efficacy against cervical and anal cancer. Efficacy is also inferred for the younger age group because immunogenicity (ant ibody responses) is non -inferior to that seen in older age groups. Immunogenicity Although there is no known correlate of protection (ie, an established antibody level required for protection against HPV -related disease), HPV vaccines generate excellent antibody responses in most recipients. HPV4 Immunisation with three doses of HPV4 vaccine produces antibody responses against HPV16, HPV18, HPV6 and HPV11 in more than 99 percent of vaccine recipients. The peak antibody titres following three doses of HPV vaccine are greater than that following natural infection. A Cochrane systematic review found the immunogenicity of two - and three -dose HPV vaccination schedules in young female s to be comparable.45 Two doses of HPV4 are more immunogenic in recipients aged between 9 and under 15 years than in older groups aged over 15 years and comparable to three doses in older recipients (those over 15 years).46 In young females, two doses have been found to be non -inferior to three doses for at least 21 months after vaccinatio n, particularly when the interval between doses is at least six months.47, 48 The immunogenicity of three doses of HPV4 vaccine has been established to be robust and long -lasting.49, 50, 51 Anamnestic responses have been demonstrated out to at least 8.5 years.51 Differences in seroconversion rates and antibody titres were seen in immunocompromised individuals. The immune response to HPV4 among immunocompromised children appears adequate,52, 53 although antibody titres were lower than those in healthy children of the same age groups.52 Seroconversion among HIV-infect ed individuals has been demonstrated to be robust and higher among those with lower HIV loads or on antiretroviral therapy.54, 55, 56 While some immunosuppression regimes can attenuate the immune response to HPV4, patients with autoimmune diseases generally appear to respond well to the vaccine.57 In contrast, adult solid organ transplant recipients produce suboptimal response s to HPV4.58 240 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 HPV9 The immunogenicity of HPV9 vaccine was initially assessed in women aged 16 -26 years.59 Antibody responses generated by the HPV9 were non -inferior to HPV4 against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18; and in girls and boys aged 9 -15 years.60 Antibody responses to all nine vaccine HPV types in girls and boys aged 9 -15 years and men aged 16 -26 years were non -inferior to women aged 16 -26 years.61, 62 Men who have sex with men appear to produce lower antibody titres than heterosexual men (although seroconversion rates to all nine vaccine types were greater than 99 percent in both groups).61 This lower antibody response is possibly due to greater exposure to the virus, highlighting the importance of vaccination at a young age. The immunogenicity of two doses of HPV9 in girls and boys aged 9 -14 years was non - inferior to three doses in women aged 16 -26 years, the age group in which efficacy was demonstrated.63 Efficacy HPV-related cancers HPV4 and HPV9 vaccines offer similar protection against cervical, vaginal and vulval precancerous lesions or cancer in women vaccinated at 15 -26 years.45 Protection is greatest among young women not initially infected with HPV 16/18 prior to vaccination (vaccine efficacy of 95 percent [95% CI: 83 -99] against vaginal and vulval lesions).64 HPV9 efficacy was studied in women aged 16 -26 years and compared with HPV4.59 HPV9 prevented cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease and persistent infection related to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 (the five additional serotypes in HPV9). The antibody response and incidence of disease related to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 were similar in the two vaccine groups. Protection against CIN 2/3 or adenocarcinoma in situ is widely accepted as a surrogate for protection against invasive cancer, since study participants who develop these precancerous lesions require treatment to prevent progression to invasive cancer. Bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing these HPV16 - and HPV18 -related precancerous lesions in females.1, 65 In the pivotal efficacy trial in women aged 15 -26 years, HPV4 vaccine efficacy for the prevention of precancerous lesions related to HPV16 or HPV18 was 98 percent (95% CI: 86-100) in the per -protocol susceptible population.66 A phase III clinical trial among Asian and Latin American women found population - specific vaccine efficacy to be more than 96 percent against any grade of cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease and more than 93 percent efficacy against six -month persist ent HPV infection.67 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 241 Studies in males, including men who have sex with men, have shown that HPV4 vaccine is efficacious against anal HPV infection and associated precancerous lesions.9, 68, 69 HPV4 protects men vaccinated between ages 16 -26 years against genital warts or external genital lesions comp ared with unvaccinated dummy controls.45 Effectiveness A 2016 systematic review of published literature summarised the global exp eriences with HPV4 from 1 January 2007 to 29 February 2016.70 It assessed the global effect of HPV4 vaccine on HPV infection, genital warts and cervical abnormalities based on 57 publications across nine countries. The greatest impact was seen in countries with high vaccine uptake and among girls vaccinated prior to HPV exposure. Maximal reductions of around 90 percent were reported for vaccine -type HPV infections (6, 11, 16, 18) and genital wart cases. For women vaccinated before the age of 20 years, the risk of CIN2+ was significantly lower than in unvaccinated wo men (effectiveness of at least one dose is 58 -77 percent ).71, 72, 73 Duration of protection As vaccination programmes have only been in place for little over a decade, the duration of protection is not yet fully known. Follow -up studies 8 -10 years after HPV vaccination have shown no waning of protection.1 Long -term studies are ongoing to determine the duration of efficacy for all HPV vaccines. Herd immunity and population impact In January 2019, WHO began considering a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer and established clear targets t o 2030. This is only achievable with high vaccination coverage and access to regular screening for all women.74, 75 Australia saw a reduction in the prevalence of vaccine -type HPV infections (6, 11, 16, 18) in unvaccinated young men after the introduction of the vaccine to young women, supporting the role of herd immunity.76, 77, 78 There was also a significant decrease in the prevalence of vaccine -type HPV infections in unvaccinated women (aged 25 years or younger).79 Vaccination of females has provided herd immunity against oropharyngeal HPV16 prevalence in unvaccinated males in the UK.80 In a study of sexual health clinic data in Melbourne, the researchers noted the near disappearance of genital warts in women and heterosexual men aged under 21 years.78 In addition, the data indicated that the basic reproductive rate (see section 1.2.1) had fallen below one. This reduction in cases occurred without any corresponding reduction in women aged over 30 years, men who have sex with men and non - residents. Similar trends were noted in the data from the Australian genital warts national surveillance network. 242 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Eleven years after the introduction of HPV4 vaccine in the US, HPV4 types declined by 81 percent in vaccinated women and 40 percent in unvaccina ted women. As well as direct protection from HPV9 vaccine, potential cross -protection from HPV4 was also observed in vaccinated women with a 71 percent decline in prevalence of the additional, genetically related HPV9 types.4 Previous exposure to HPV While efficacy is unclear, there are no safety concerns in offering vaccination to women who have had HPV -related disease and would like to use the vaccine to reduce the risk of further disease. A retrospective analysis of the HPV4 vaccine 's pivot al efficacy trial data (Future I and Future II) studied a group of women who were vaccinated before they had their first treatment for HPV -related disease.81 This showed a reduction in subsequent HPV-related disease in vaccinated women aged 15 -26 years who had received treatment for cervical, vulvar or vaginal disease during the trial. The study showed a 46.2 percent reduction (95% CI: 22.5 -63.2) after cervical surgery of any HPV -related disease and 35.2 percent reduction (95% CI: 18.8 -51.8) after diagnosis of genital warts or vag inal or vulvar disease. In contrast, a systematic review found that there was no evidence that HPV vaccines were effective in preventing vaccine -type HPV -associated precancer in pre -exposed women. This review explored efficacy against CIN3+ precancers in women with evidence of prior vaccine -type HPV exposure in three randomised controlled trials and two post -trial cohort studies.82 Despite these findings, it was concluded that longer - term benefits in preventing re -infection could not be excluded (ie, the vaccine is not therapeutic but may prevent future infection, emphasising the importance of vaccination prior to sexual debut). 10.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) +2\u00b0C +8\u00b0C. Do not freeze. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 243 10.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of HPV vaccine is 0.5 mL, administered by intramuscular injection in the deltoid area (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines HPV vaccine may be co -administered with any live or inactivated vaccine indicated at the same visit.1 Interchangeability All HPV vaccines may be used interchangeably for completion of a course.83 10.5 Recommended immunisation schedule 10.5.1 Reco mmended and funded From 1 January 2017 males and females aged 26 years and under became eligible for HPV vaccine. Including males in a routine vaccination programme is expected to increase the benefit to the population in terms of reduction for both HPV -related cancer outcomes and genital warts. Immunisation should preferably be completed before the onset of sexual activity. The optimal time for HPV administration is at age 9 -13 years, as the immunogenicity is more effective when given younger and as most males and females in this age group would be na\u00efve to all HPV types. However, individuals who have begun sexual activity may still benefit from vaccination. The decision to vaccinate older age groups should follow an assessment of the potential benefits of vaccination - based on their likely previous HPV exposure and future risks. See Table 10.3 for HPV vaccine recommendations and schedules. A two -dose schedule of HPV at 0 and 6 -12 months is recommended for individuals who receive the first dose before their 15th birthday, even if the y are 15 years or older at the time of the second dose. Three doses are required for this age group if they have confirmed HIV infection or are transplant or chemotherapy patients, or if the minimum dosing interval is not met (see below). Older individuals from age 15 years receive three doses of HPV vaccine, at 0, 2 and 6 months. 244 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 10.3: HPV vaccine recommendations and schedules Note: HPV vaccine may be offered from age 9 years, but the usual Schedule wi ll be at age 11/12 years (school years 7/8).

If a shortened schedule is required, the 3 doses can be given over a 5 -month period, with a minimum of 4 weeks between any two doses. d. For more informati on see sections 4.3.8 and 4.3.9. e. HPV vaccines are registered for use in females aged 9 -45 years and males aged 9 -26 years. However, there are no theoretical concerns that the efficacy or safety of HPV vaccine in males up to the age of 45 years will differ significantly from females of the same age or younger males. Note For the two -dose HPV schedule for children aged 14 years and under: a two -dose schedule at least 6 -12 months apart is recommended for individuals who receive the first dose before their 15th birthday, even if they are 15 years or older at the time of the second dose the second dose is preferably given at least six months after the first; however, if the second dose is given less than five months after the first, a third HPV dose is recommended and funded - give the third HPV dose at least five months a fter the first. Individuals who started with HPV4 may complete their remaining doses with HPV9. Individuals who were under age 27 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the three -dose course, even if they are older than 27 years when they complete it. HPV9 is not funded for those individuals who were previously fu lly vaccinated with HPV4. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 245 Non-residents who were under age 18 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the course, even if they are older than 18 years when they complete it. 10.5.2 Recommended but not funded Individuals aged 2 7 years and older The decision to vaccinate older age groups should follow an assessment of the potential benefits of vaccination - based on their likely previous HPV exposure and future risks. The data from the pivotal studies for HPV4 has demonstrated p otential benefit to some women older than 25 years and the vaccine was shown to be effective at preventing infection and disease from the vaccine types in women aged 24 -45 years who were uninfected at baseline.84 However, pre -vaccination testing for cervical cytological abnormalities or for HPV infection is not recommended. HPV9 is registered for use in females aged 9 -45 years and in males aged 9 -26 years. However, there are n o theoretical concerns that the efficacy or safety of HPV vaccine in males up to the age of 45 years will differ significantly from females of the same age or younger males. 10.5.3 Pregnancy and breastfeeding HPV vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women; however, enquiring about the possibility of pregnancy is not necessary before vaccination.85 Data to date shows no adverse effects of HPV vaccines on pregnancy outcomes.1, 86, 87 However, if a vaccine dose has been administered around the time of conception or during pregnancy, health professionals are advised to report this to CARM (see section 1.6.3) and the vaccine manufacturer to assist with ongoing safety monitoring. If a woman is found to be pregnant after starting the HPV vaccine schedule, the remaining doses should be delayed until after pregnancy. HPV vaccines may be given to breastfeeding women.88 246 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 10.6 Contraindications and precautions See section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 10.6.1 Contraindications HPV vaccine should not be administered to people with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of HPV vaccine or to a vaccine component. HPV vaccines contain HPV proteins produced by genetically engineered yeast cells. They should not, therefore, be given to people with a history of an immediate hypersensitivity to yeast. 10.6.2 Precautions Pregnancy is a precaution - see section 10.5.3 . 10.7 Potential responses and AEFIs HPV vaccines have excellent safety profiles internationally. There have been no safety signals raised since the vaccines w ere licensed, and a number of large investigations have been carried out to assess specific outcomes, particularly autoimmune conditions.89, 90, 91, 92, 93 Post-marketing surveillance systems globally continue to monitor the sa fety of HPV vaccination programmes.94, 95, 96 The WHO 's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has systematically reviewed HPV vaccine safety and has not found any safety issue that would alter its recommendations for use.97, 98 The main challenge with HPV vaccine is communicating its excellent safety profile.99 (See also the HPV discussion in section 3.2.4.) Syncope (fainting) occurs frequently in adolescents following vaccination, but this is a stress response to being vaccinated, not a reaction to the vaccine.2, 100, 101 WHO recognises immunisation -related stress responses as potential responses to HPV vaccination (see section 2.3.3).102 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 247 Safety has been evaluated in approximately 15,000 subjects in the HPV9 clinical development programme an d no new safety signals have been shown through post - marketing surveillance.83, 103 The vaccine is well -tolerated, and most adverse events were injection -site-related pain, swell ing, and erythema that were mild to moderate in intensity. The safety profile of HPV9 is like HPV4. Female HPV9 recipients had more injection -site adverse events than female HPV4 recipients, including swelling (40.3 percent compared to 29.1 percent in HPV4 recipients) and erythema (34 percent compared to 25.8 percent in HPV4 recipients). Male recipients had fewer injection -site adverse events and were similar following either vaccine. Rates of injection -site swelling and erythema both increased foll owing each successive dose of HPV9. In summary, HPV9 is well -tolerated in all age groups, although it is slightly more reactogenic than HPV4.59, 61, 83 The most common adverse events are pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, headache and pyrexia. The frequency of th ese common adverse events is increased slightly (up to two -fold) when concurrent vaccinations are given.104 10.8 Cancer prevention measures For women, HPV immunisation is part of a thr ee-pronged approach to cervical cancer prevention that also includes regular cervical screening and safer sex approaches. For men, HPV immunisation and safer sex approaches are expected to contribute to the prevention of HPV -related cancers and disease tha t affect men, as well as cervical cancer prevention in women. 10.8.1 HPV immunisation By preventing infection with oncogenic HPV types, HPV vaccination can reduce the incidence of precursor lesions that may lead to cancer. Vaccination needs to be administered be fore HPV infection occurs to prevent atypia and malignancy. Because genital HPVs are so common and so readily transmitted, in practical terms vaccination should be offered before the onset of sexual activity; that is, during or prior to early adolescence. HPV immunisation does not reduce the progression of established disease but can be used in therapeutic situations by preventing the reactivation of latent infection or acquiring new infections. 248 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 10.8.2 Regular cervical screening for women A successful HPV immuni sation programme for men and women will reduce the community prevalence of HPV infection and thus the incidence of cervical cancer in women. However, HPV immunisation alone will not completely eliminate cervical cancer , because some women will not have bee n vaccinated, a few will not develop immunity despite vaccination, and some will be infected prior to vaccination or with oncogenic types not included in the vaccine. Consequently, women will need to continue to undergo regular cervical screening to detec t those precancerous lesions that occur despite vaccination. Cervical screening programmes are based on regular cytological screening or HPV testing to detect, monitor and treat at an early stage precancerous lesion, or CIN. These programmes have been succ essful in reducing invasive disease and mortality. Although the frequency of abnormal cytology is lower in the vaccinated group, women who have received HPV immunisation should still take part in the National Cervical Screening Programme. Three -yearly cervical smears are recommended for women between the ages of 25 and 70 years who have ever been sexually active. 10.8.3 Safer sex approaches To minimise the risk of HPV infection (plus other sexually transmitted infections), practitioners should remind individuals of safer sex approaches, including sexual abstinence, monogamous relationships, delayed sexual debut and minimising the number of sexual partners.1 Consistent and correct use of condoms can decrease the risk of anogenital HPV infection when infected areas are covered or protected by the condom. However, HPV transmission in the genital region may occur even when condoms are used an d does not necessarily require penetrative intercourse.8 10.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheets HPV vaccines are registered for use in females aged 9 -45 years and in males aged 9 -26 years. However, there are no theoretical concerns that the efficacy or safety of HPV IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 249 vaccine in males up to the age of 45 years will d iffer significantly from females of the same age or younger males (see section 10.5.2 ). For the three -dose schedules, the HPV vaccine data sheets recommend that all three doses are given within a 12 -month period. The Ministry of Health recommends that if the three -dose schedule has been interrupted, prior doses do not need to be repeated regardless of how long ago the previous doses were given (see Appendix 2 ). The HPV9 data sheet states that there are no studies on the interchangeability of HPV vaccine s. The Ministry of Health recommends that all HPV vaccines may be used interchangeably for completion of a course.83 Those individ uals who started with HPV4 may complete their remaining doses with HPV9.

Incubation period Usually 1 -3 days (range 1 -7 days). Period of communicability From 1 -2 days before symptoms start until about day 5 of illness; may be longer in young children and if immunocompromised. Asymptomatic spread is common. Incidence and burden of disease Influenza epidemics occur each year. The highest burden of disease is in the very young, the elderly, pregnant women , those with co -morbid conditions, people from low income groups and Mori and Pacific ethnic groups. Funded vaccines Quadrivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine: children aged 6 months to under 3 years (ie, aged 6 -35 months): Afluria Quad Jun ior adults and children aged 3 years and older: Afluria Quad. Dose, presentation, route 0.25 mL for young children (age from 6 -35 months) and 0.5 mL for older children and adults per dose Pre-filled syringe Intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection (if indicated) Funded vaccine indications and recommended schedule 1 dose is recommended and funded annually from 1 April for: pregnant women individuals aged 65 years and older individuals aged 6 months to under 65 years with eligi ble conditions (Table 11.3) children aged 4 years or under who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness (including measles) or have a history of significant respiratory illness. Children aged under 9 years who hav e not previously received influenza vaccine require 2 doses 4 weeks apart (funded for children with eligible conditions). Recommended, unfunded Occupational: recommended for health care workers, teachers and support staff in schools and early childhood education and staff in long - term care and aged -care facilities . Recommended particularly for all close contacts (eg, caregivers, family members) of those at high risk from influenza . Universally recommended for anyone age from 6 months, annually. Vaccine effectiveness Depends on the match of the strains in the vaccine with circulating strains, the age of the individual and whether they have any underlying medical conditions. Vaccination can prevent disease or reduce severity. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 257 Precautions and special considerations Seek specialist advice for individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have discontinued treatment within the past 6 months. There may be a small increased risk of fever and febril e convulsions with concomitant delivery of PCV13 and influenza vaccine in children aged 6 months to under 5 years. Potential response to vaccine Mild fever, headache, muscle aches, local swelling and mild pain at injection site. Children aged under 5 years are more likely than older children or adults to have a febrile reaction to influenza vaccine. 11.1 Virology Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridiae family, and are classified into influenza virus types A, B and C. Influenza A virus subtypes a re classied based on two surface antigens: haemagglutinin (H), responsible for cell surface attachment during infection neuraminidase (N), which potentiates the release of new virions from the cell. Subtypes which have in the past caused pandemics includ e the influenza A H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 viruses, while the H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 viruses continue to cause epidemics as seasonal influenza viruses. Influenza B has two lineages of viruses: B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, which are also associated with out breaks and epidemics, and account for a significant proportion of the overall burden of influenza.1 Influenza C is associated with mild cases of upper respiratory infection. 11.1.1 Antigenic drift Influenza A and B viruses undergo frequent small changes (mutations) in their segmented RNA genome over time. The mutations can occur in the coding regions responsible for H and N surface antigens. This 'antigenic drift ' leads to the emergence of new antig enic variants or virus strains. These new strains are described by the geographic site of isolation, laboratory number and year of isolation; for example, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2). Because of this ongoing antigenic drift, seasonal influenza virus vacc ine formulations are reviewed by the WHO bi -annually. 258 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11.1.2 Antigenic shift New influenza A virus subtypes emerge periodically that have caused pandemics in humans. The new virus subtype has novel H and N surface antigens result from the mixing of genomic segments of two or more influenza A viruses. This is known as 'antigenic shi ft'. Other possible mechanisms for the emergence of new influenza viruses are through the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to infect humans and the re-assortment of the genomic segments of multiple viruses (ie, human, avian and pig influenza viruses). 11.2 Clinical features Influenza is contagious, with a reproductive number (R0) estimated at 1.4 -4 (see section 1.2.1).2 The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets generated by sneezing and coughing that land directly on respiratory mucous membranes by aerosolised droplets or by direct or indirect contact (via contaminated hands or fomites).2, 3, 4 The incubation period can range from one to seven days (average one to three days), during which time the virus replicates in the ciliated columnar epithel ial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract. An infected person is contagious from one to two days before symptoms start until about day ve of the illness. Peak viral shedding occurs one to three days after the development of symptoms, diminishing to low levels by ve days. Children shed more virus and remain infectious for longer than adults. There is a wide range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe disease. Mild influenza with non -specific symptoms is common, resulting in a large proportion of viral transmission and undetected infections.5 In older children and adults, the illness charact eristically begins abruptly with fever and a variety of clinical symptoms, including chills, malaise, headache, myalgia, non -productive cough, rhinitis, sore throat and mild conjunctivitis. Vomiting and diarrhoea may be present. While children aged under 5 years have fever, cough and rhinitis, infants may present with unexplained fever or sepsis -like syndrome only.3 In the young, influenza virus may cause croup, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Fever is often less evident in the elderly, who may present with other symptoms, such as anorexia, fatigue or confusion. Influenza typically resolves af ter several days in most people, although cough and malaise may persist for two or more weeks. Infections due to pandemic influenza A strains are more likely to lead to severe morbidity and increased mortality than influenza B or seasonal influenza A stra ins. Influenza B infections were previously thought to generally cause more mild illness, but numerous studies indicate that there is little difference between clinical symptoms and outcomes of influenza B compared to influenza A.1 Influenza B -associated hospitalisations and mortality may have previously been underestimated; studies have reported higher mortality following influenza B infection than A in some years.1 Influenza B infection is more common in children aged 5 -17 years than in other age groups, and disease is likely to be more severe in children than in adults.6 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 259 Influenza ca n exacerbate underlying medical conditions, such as pulmonary, cardiac or metabolic disease. Some of the many reported complications associated with influenza include pneumonia, respiratory failure, myositis, encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, myocardit is and pericarditis, with aspirin use in children), bronchitis, otitis media and death. The risk of complications is increased in pregnancy.7 Also associated with influenza infection is increased frailty and cognitive decline in older people and incidence of cardio vascular disease are also associated with influenza infection.8, 9 Influenza during pregnancy can result in poorer outcomes for the mother and her fetus, including preterm birth and fetal loss.10, 11 Asymptomatic influenza The majority of influenza infections are asymptomatic, and most symptomatic cases self-manage without seeking medical help.12, 13 Results from the 2015 New Zealand Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness, Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) serosurvey showed that around 32 percent of people surveyed h ad serologically confirmed influenza over the 2015 season (adjusted for age and ethnicity).5, 14 Overall only one -quarter of those reported influenza -like illness; three out of four people were asymptomatic; only 1 out of 47 visited their GP and 1 in 680 were hospitalised. Young children and Pacific people experienced the highest influenza infection attack rates.15 11.3 Epidemiology 11.3.1 Global epidemiology Influenza is an im portant cause of disease worldwide. Annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths globally.16, 17 For example, it was estimated globally that 11.5 percent of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), 5.6 percent of LRTI deaths and 9.5 million LRTI hospitalisations were attributable to influenza in 2017.18 In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influ enza occurs throughout the year causing outbreaks more irregularly.16 From time to time, pandemics occur when a new virus arises and spreads globally (see section 11.3.3 ). The last influenza pandemic was caused by the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. More than 214 countries and overseas territories reported laboratory -confirmed influenza, including over 18,449 deaths.19 Many more deaths were found to associated with the pandemic due to respiratory and cardiovascular complica tions.20 260 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology New Zealand experiences the typical temperate climate epidemiology of influenza, with the peak incidence occurring during the winter months, however, influenza activity occurs throughout the year. The impact of influenza in New Zealand is substantial in terms of general practice consultations, hospita lisations and deaths. The highest burden of disease is in the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, those with co -morbid conditions, people from low-income groups, and Pacific and Mori ethnic groups. Influenza surveillance The New Zealand influenza su rveillance system compiles information from a variety of sources, including: national sentinel general practice -based influenza -like illness surveillance (part of the WHO 's Global Influenza Programme) year-round laboratory -based surveillance by the regiona l virus diagnostic laboratories hospital -based severe acute respiratory infection surveillance in Auckland and Counties Manukau DHBs data from Healthline, HealthStat, publicly funded hospital discharges and the NIR. Influenza prevalence and circulating st rains are monitored through general practice surveillance for influenza -like illness (ILI); hospitalisations are monitored for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admissions; and severity is determined by the proportion of hospitalisations requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.21 For example, during the 2019 season the levels of influenza -like illness and the overall impact were low and generally just above seasonal baseline.22 However, SARI hospitalisation rates increased earlier than in previous years and, during the winter, a higher than usual proportion of vir al respiratory illnesses were due to influenza. A(H3N2) and B/Victoria strains were co -circulating. Seriousness was similar to other A(H3N2) predominant years. Influenza A viruses were detected most frequently in hospitalised patients whereas influenza B w as detected more in the community. In contrast, in 2018 the predominant strain was A(H1N1)pdm09 strain which is associated with high severity in those aged younger than 65 years.23 Over one -half of those admitted to ICUs with influenza -associated SARI in 2018 did not report any pre - existing medical risk factors, consistent with being younger.23 For detailed information, including influenza surveillance and inf luenza see the ESR HANDBOOK 2020 261 Influenza immunisation uptake In 2019, more than 1.35 million doses of influenza vaccine were distributed. This equated to just over one quarter of the whole population (270 doses per 1 ,000 population).22 According to Ministry of Health data, publicly funded influenza vaccine uptake for individuals aged 65 years and older was around 63 percent in 2019 based on reporting from funding claims; this is likely to be an underestimate of the coverage. National influenza immunisation coverage for DHB staff increased from 45 percent in 2010 to 73 percent (ranging from 54 to 87 percent ) in 2019, but remained below the goal of 80 percent coverage across all DH B staff.24 11.3.3 Pandemic influenza The natural ecology of influenza type A viruses is among wild aquatic avian species, and from time to time, these viruses spill over into other species, including humans. These avian influenza virus infections are usually severe and associated with a high mortality; however, they are rar ely transmitted from human to human. In the past, avian viruses have become transmissible either through adaptation or the acquisition of swine or human genomic material, and when natural immunity has been lacking in the population, have resulted in a pand emic with global spread. There have been four influenza pandemics recorded since 1918. Pandemics have the potential to result in large numbers of severe infections, but the degree of severity is hard to predict and will depend upon many factors, including whether there is any previous community immunity. The most severe recorded influenza pandemic was the 'Spanish flu ' A(H1N1) pandemic of 1918 -1920, which caused an estimated 20 -50 million deaths worldwide. The most recent pandemic was the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. It was estimated that 18 percent (800,000) of the New Zealand population were infected with the virus during the first wave, including one in every three children.25 Risk factors for severe outcomes included obesity, pregnancy,26 diabetes mellitus and Pacific or Mori ethnicity.25 This strain is now established as a circulating seasonal influenza strain. Globally, in the first 16 months of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, 18,500 deaths were attributed to laboratory -confirmed influenza. When investigated further, it was estimated that over 201,000 respiratory deaths and an additional 83,300 cardiovascular deaths were associated wit h the pandemic - producing a rate 15 times higher than the laboratory -confirmed deaths. Of these deaths, 80 percent were younger than 65 years of age.20 Monitoring, surveillance and response for new pandemic strains are in place. See sectio n 11.8.3 . 262 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11.4 Vaccines Annual influenza vaccination is a most important measure for preventing influenza infection and mortality. The National Influenza Strategy Group, coordinated by IMAC, is responsible for New Zealand 's annual National Influenza Promotional Campaign (www.influenza.org.nz ). This campaign includes an annual influenza kit for health care professionals and a na tional education and communication programme. 11.4.1 Available vaccines Funded vaccines Two quadrivalent split virion influenza vaccines are funded. Afluria Quad (Seqirus) for adults and children from 3 years of age27 Each 0.5 mL dose contains 15 \u00b5g of each of the four recommended influenza strains; other components and excipients include sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, calcium chloride dihydrate and water for injections to 0.5 mL. Trace amounts of the following may also be present in each 0.5 mL dose: sodium taurodeoxycholate, ovalbumin Quad Junior (Seqirus) for infants and child ren aged 6 months to under 3 years (ie, aged 6 -35 months) Each 0.25 ml dose of Alfuria Quad Junior (Seqirus) contains 7.5 \u00b5g of haemagglutinin of each of the same four influenza strains that are in Alfuria Quad. Availability of influenza vaccines, particu larly the unfunded vaccines, can vary during the season depending on demand and supply (see www.influenza.org.nz ). Vaccine preparations and potential future options Influenza vaccine preparations vary by their t ype, the number of influenza strains contained in the vaccine and their delivery systems. There are a range of delivery mechanisms available internationally, including intradermal injection and intranasal mists. Live attenuated influenza vaccines are deliv ered by intranasal spray. Some data suggest that intradermal vaccines may induce improved immune responses, particularly in older adults.28, 29 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 263 The seasonal influenza vaccine strains vary each year depending on the prevailing viruses. WHO conducts technical consultations in February/March and September each year to recommend viruses for inclusion in both trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons, respectively. In recent years, the southern hemisphere recommendations include the two influenza type A (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) and two B (Victor ia and Yamagata) strains likely to circulate in New Zealand over the coming influenza seasons.30 Split virion influenza vaccines Only quadrivalent split virion influenza vaccines were available in New Zealand for the 2020 influenza season. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) contain two type A and two type B influenza strains. They are split virion vaccines prepared from virus grown in embryonated hens ' eggs. The virus is puried, disrupted and inactivated by splitting with beta-propiolactone or formaldehyde. QIVs offer broader protection agains t co-circulating B -strains and better effectiveness in seasons of B -strain mismatch than trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs), which contain two influenza type A strains and one type B strain.1 Live attenuate d influenza vaccines At the time of writing, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) were not registered in New Zealand. LAIVs may induce stronger immune responses than TIV or QIVs, particularly in children, by mimicking natural influenza infection and evoking both mucosal and systemic immunity, including broader cellular immune responses.31 Trivalent and quadrivalent LAIVs are licensed for use in North America for healthy non -pregnant individuals aged 2-49 years and in Europe for children aged 2 -18 years.32 LAIVs have be en shown to be effective in children aged 6 months to 7 years.33 During the 2013/14 and 2015/16 influenza seasons, effectiveness of LAIV against the predominant A(H1N1) strain was lower in the US in children age 2 -17 years than that observed in the UK during the same seasons, such that the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) temporarily withdrew its recommendations for LAIVs use during 2016/17 influenza season.32, 34 LAIVs were reinstated during the 2019/20 20 season. UK data from the 2018/19 season showed that LAIV effectiveness in children aged 2-17 years was at least as good as QIV in children for whom LAIV is contraindicated, particularly against A(H1N1)pdm09.34, 35, 36 It is remains unclear why there were such significant differences in effectiveness for differe nt regions, although variations in circulating strain matches, the make -up of the LAIV itself and previous vaccination history may all have some effect.34 264 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Adjuvanted and high -dose vaccines For the 2020 season, influenza vaccines containing adjuvants or high -dose formulations were not available in New Zealand. Evidence to compare adjuvanted, high-dose and quadrivalent vaccines is cu rrently limited and research is ongoing to evaluate their application. Adjuvants enhance the immune response to an antigen and require less antigen (antigen sparing). Internationally, there are three adjuvants licensed for use in influenza vaccines: two o il-in-water emulsions and a third that uses immunopotentiating reconstituted influenza virosomes.3 Vaccines with these adjuvants show modestly improved immune responses, which may be particularly useful for the elderly and young children, but may also cause more local and systemic reactions than unadjuvanted vaccines.3, 37 High -dose influenza vaccines containing four times more haemagglutinin antigen than standard vaccines have been shown to be more effective against influenza -related death and all-cause hospitalisation in the elderly than standard -dose trivalent vaccines.38 11.4.2 Efcacy and effectiveness International data The efficacy (prevention of illness among vaccinated individuals in controlled trials) and effectiveness (prevention of illness in vaccinated populations) of influenza vaccine depends on several factors. The age and immune competence of the vaccine recipient are important factors, as well as the match between the virus strains in the vaccine and those in circulation each year. Mismatches can evolve during a season or due to mutations occurring during vaccine manufacture (egg adaptation).35 Previous vaccination history has been suggested to reduce the vaccine effectiveness in some cases; possibly more so when the previous vaccination was mismatched with the circulating strains at the time.39 More recently, prior -season vaccination history has not been associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness in children or adults, and findings support annual revaccination.35, 40, 41, 42, 43 With increasing complexity, this continues to be researched. Two influenza B strains can frequently co -circulate, and due to the challenges involved in predicting which B strains will circulate in the upcoming season, mis matches between the B strain selected for TIVs and the circulating B strains have occurred in up to one -half of influenza seasons. The capacity of QIVs (containing two B influenza strains) to provide broader immune responses against B strains and cross -protection during B -mismatched seasons is expected to prevent more influenza cases, hospitalisations and deaths than TIVs.1 Data for vaccine efficacy and effectiveness of TIVs is summarised in Table 11.1.

While there is some variability from year to year and with different strains, the data overall show that the point estimate for influenza vaccine effectiveness is approximately 50 percent for preventing general practice visits, hospitalisations and for both influenza typ e A and B strains.53, 60, 61, 62 Estimates for vaccine effectiveness tend to be higher in children and healthy midlife a dults, and lower in the elderly. Influenza vaccination significantly reduces influenza -associated ICU admissions and attenuates disease severity in adults who were infected despite vaccination.63 Low influenza activity over recent years in New Zealand can cause imprecision in estimating annual vaccine effectiveness.23, 64 Pregnant women, the fetus and neonates A pregnant woman and her fetus are at increased risk of influenza complications.7 Physiological and immunological changes in pregnant women increase susceptibility to influenza.65 Hospitalisation from influenza -related cardiorespiratory disorders during the second and third trimesters was especially apparent in the 2009 pandemic.66 Influenza im munisation is therefore recommended during every pregnancy to reduce this risk, with similar effectiveness in healthy pregnant women as in other healthy adults against laboratory -confirmed influenza.67 During the 2012 -2013 seasons in Australia, women vaccinated in pregnancy were 81 percent less li kely to attend emergency departments and 65 percent less likely to be hospitalised with acute respiratory illness than those unvaccinated.45 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 267 Influenza immunisation during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of stillbirth. Stillbirth was half as likely among vaccinated mothers compared to unvaccinated mothers in an Australian study.11 Maternal influenza immunisation offers protection to the newborn through maternal antibody transfer.31, 47, 66, 68 Influenza vaccines are not registered and have not been shown to be effective in infants aged under 6 months: therefore, immunisation during pregnancy confers protection to newborns and in fants who are too young to be vaccinated.10, 46 Maternal influenza immunisation is significantly associated with reduced risk of influenza virus infection and influenza -related hospitalisation in infants up to 6 months of age and increased influenza antibody titres are maintained in infants through to age 2 -3 months.46, 69 Children Influenza vaccination in children provides similar protection to that seen in healthy adults. Effectiveness against laboratory -confirmed influenza is around 65 percent in young children aged 6 months to 5 years when vaccine and circulating strains are well-matched.48, 49, 50 Influenza vaccination offers the greatest protection against influenza -related hospitalisation to children who are fully immunised with routine vaccines.70 QIV vaccine effectiveness against influenza hospitalisation of children in the 2018 season in Australia was estimated to be 78.8 percent (95% CI 66.9 -86.4); this was when Australia expanded the funded influenza vaccination programme to preschool children, those with comorbid medical conditions and all indigenous children.71 The additional benefit of vaccinating children is protection of those around them, including grandparents and infants. Healthy adults Generally, randomised placebo -controlled trials of TIV in healthy adults support good protection against laboratory -confirmed influenza.52 Effectiveness against laboratory - confirmed influenza is around 60 percent in adults, but varies with the match of vaccine with circulating strains ( see Table 11.1). Adults aged over 65 years Although currently available influenza vaccines are less effective at preventing clinical illness in older people,72 influenza vaccination does reduce hospitalisation and deaths. Effectiveness in community -dwelling adults aged over 60 years depends on how well the vaccine matches the circulating strains.3 Influenza vaccine was moderately effective against laboratory -confirmed influenza during an epidemic season in community - dwelling adults age 65 year or older, irrespective of vaccine strain match. Significance was less durin g non -epidemic seasons and varied with virus type (the highest effectiveness was against A[H1N1] and the lowest against B).73 268 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vaccination has been demonstrated to prevent hospitalisation and death in older nursing home residents.74, 75, 76, 77 A meta -analysis across 11 studies estimated influenza vaccination effectiveness to 37 percent (95% CI: 18 -53; p=0.001) against pneumonia and 34 percent (95% CI: 10 -53; p=0.01) against death due to pneumonia or influenza in institutionalised older adults.78 A 2010 Cochrane review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support influenza vaccine effectiveness in the elderly;79 however, reanalysis of that review and its methodology argued that there is substantial evidence for the ability of influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of influenza infection and influenza -related disease and death in the elderly.48, 58 Severity of influenza symptoms are modestly attenuated by influenza vaccination in the elderly.80 Therefore, by reducing severity of disease, vaccination can reduce the risk or duration of hospitalisation. Hospitalisation and immobility in the elderly leads to physical and mental decline, increased frailty and loss of independence.8, 80, 81, 82 Co-morbid conditions in adults and children Influenza vaccination has been associated with reductions in hospitalisations and deaths among adults with risk factors for i nfluenza complications, including diabetes,83, 84 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease85, 86 and heart failure.54 Obese adults have a similar risk of influenza -associated hospitalisati ons as those with cardiovascular disease and diabetes.87 Among Danish adults aged under 65 years with underlying medical conditions, vaccination reduced all -cause deaths by 78 percent and hospitalisations attributable to respiratory infections or cardiopulmonary diseases by 87 percen t.88 An Australian study of adults aged 40 years and older showed that unvaccinated adults are almost twice as likely as vaccinated adults to have an acute myocardial infarct.89, 90 Influenza vaccination is as effective as other preventative coronary care therapies (eg, smoking cessation, statins and antihypertensives) in protection against cardiovascular events.90 During the 2018 season in Australia, QIV vaccine effectiveness against influenza -related hospitalisation for children with comorbidities was est imated to be 77.3 percent (95% CI 59.8 -87.2%).71 This highlights the importance of vaccinating children, as well as adults, with comorbidities against influenza. Herd immunity Influenza vaccination can provide indirect protection to those who are unimmunised or respond less well to the vaccine. This has been shown in certain settings, such as within schools and nursing homes.3 There is evidence to suggest that herd immunity can be achieved, pa rticularly by vaccinating children.91 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 269 The UK has progressively rolled -out a vaccination programme using LAIV and QIV, starting with children aged 2 -3 years in 2013/14 and extended to children aged 4-7 years in 2015/16. As of the 2019/2020 season, influenza vaccine is offered in the UK to all children aged 2 -10 years and up to 18 years for high risk groups. Early results from school -based pilot studies provided evidence of direct effect, indirect effects and overall impact, with decreases in disease incidence and influenza positivity in vaccinated and non -vaccinated gr oups.92 A systematic review found that vaccination of children conferred indirect protection in some but not all settings.93 Some studies suggest that herd immunity may also be achieved in nursing homes if immunisation coverage of residents is greater than 80 percent .94 Vaccinating health care workers is likely to be an effective strategy, particularly when in contact with high-risk patients.13 As shown by New Zealand SHIVERS data,5 most people who catch the virus are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms but are at risk of spreading it, such that increased vaccine uptake (funded and unfunded) across the whole population, from 6 months of age, is likely to achieve the greatest protection. Duration of immunity Due to the continual drift of influenza viruses, duration of immunity provided by influenza vaccines is difficult to study. However, when the strains stay the same for consecutive years, vaccination in a previous year appears to confer immunity into the next year for healthy adults and children.3, 32 However, shorter duration of immunity is likely in other groups, particularly the elderly.32 Protection due to LAIVs has been demonstrated to persist beyond a year.95, 96 11.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C. Do not freeze. 11.4.4 Dosage and administration The funded quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be administered by intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, if indicated (see section 2.2.3). The contents of the syringe must be shaken thoroughly before use. 270 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Individuals aged 9 years and older Individuals aged 9 years and older receive a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of a QIV vaccine. Children aged under 9 years Children aged under 9 years who have not previous ly received influenza vaccine require two doses of vaccine four weeks apart to produce a satisfactory immune response. Children aged 6 months to under 3 years (ie, aged 6 -35 months) receive a 0.25 mL dose of Afluria Quad junior; children aged 3 years and ol der receive a 0.5 mL dose of Afluria Quad (see Table 11.2). Table 11.2: Recommended influenza vaccine doses in children Age Vaccine Dose Number of doses 6-35 months Afluria Quad Junior 0.25 mL 1 or 2* 3-8 years Afluria Quad 0.5 mL 1 or 2* * Two doses separated by at least four weeks if the vaccine is being used for the rst time. The recommended dosages for young children at different ages may vary between vaccine manufacturers, so check the manufacturer 's data sheet before administering. Immunocompromised individuals Regardless of their age, previously unvaccinated immunocompromised individuals or those who have received a solid organ or haematopoietic stem cell transplant are recommended to receive two doses of influenza vaccine, four weeks apart (the second dose is unfunded).97 One dose is then given in each subsequent year. (See section 4.3.) Note: Seek specialist advice for individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have discontinued treatment within the past six months. See 'Immune checkp oint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy ' in section 4.3.2. Co-administration with other vaccines Influenza vaccine can be administered with other vaccines, such as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine98 and the scheduled childhood vaccines. Concurrent administration of influenza vaccine and 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) carries an increased risk of fever.99, 100 Separation of the vaccines by two days can be offered, but is not essential. (See also section 16.6.2 .) IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 271 11.5 Recommended immunisation schedule The optimal time to vaccinate people against influenza, particularly those in high -risk groups, is generally recommended from 1 April, annually, in advance of the usual May to September period of influenza virus activity. The vaccine can be given even when influenza virus activity has been identied, because protective antibody levels develop from four days after immunisation, with full protection after two weeks.101 The vaccine should be administered an nually to maintain immunity and to provide protection against new strains. Vaccine effectiveness may be reduced in those at highest risk from influenza. Influenza vaccine is therefore recommended annually for everyone from the age of 6 months to reduce the spread of influenza virus and to protect against influenza -related complic ations. It is particularly important to vaccinate contacts of high -risk individuals, such as family and caregivers, and those working in certain occupations. See Table 11.3 for a summary of the funded and unfunded reco mmendations for influenza immunisation. See the National Influenza Promotional Campaign website (at www.influenza.org.nz ) for further information. 272 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 11.3: Influenza vaccine recommendations Note: Funded individuals are in the shaded rows.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 273 11.5.1 Pregnancy and breastfeeding The influenza vaccine is strongly reco mmended, and funded, for women who will be pregnant while the vaccine is available. Pregnant women can receive influenza vaccination at any stage of pregnancy to protect themselves, their fetus and their newborn for each season they are pregnant. When preg nancy spans two influenza seasons, two vaccinations (one from each season) are recommended to protect against all the predicted strains. Influenza vaccine is safe to administer during any stage of pregnancy or while a woman is breastfeeding. There is no e vidence that influenza vaccine prepared from inactivated split virus or subunits causes damage to the fetus or neonate102 and there is some evidence it may be protective against stillbirth.11 Pregnant women are at greater risk from complications associated with influenza illness.7, 10 When pregnancy is superimposed on high -risk conditions such as asthma or diabetes, influenza -related morbidity is three to four times greater than in non-pregnant women with similar h igh-risk conditions. Globally, about one -quarter of influenza -associated hospital admissions and over one - third of in -hospital deaths are in infants under 6 months.103 Because there is no registered or effective vaccine for children aged under 6 months, vaccination during pregnancy is highly recommended to improve maternal -fetal passive antibody transfer.10 Influenza vaccination of pregnant women has been shown to significantly decrease influenza in their newborn babies.31, 47, 66, 68 Breastfeeding is also recommended, to deliver passive immunity to the infant.31 (See also section 4.1.2.) 11.5.2 Children at increased risk Influenza vaccine is recommended for all children aged 6 months and older, and is funded for those with chronic illnesses and a history of respiratory disease. Chi ldren with the following conditions should be prioritised to receive influenza vaccine due to their increased risk: all asthmatics on regular preventive therapy children aged under 5 years who were hospitalised with measles other children with chronic respiratory disorders (eg, cystic brosis, non -cystic brosis bronchiectasis and chronic lung disease of infancy). Special considerations apply to children, as follows (see also section 4.3): Immunisation is occasionally associated with fever between 6 and 24 hours after administration. In children aged 6 -24 months with signicant chronic medical conditions fever may cause an exacerbation of the underlying co ndition. Children receiving cancer chemotherapy may have a weaker response to influenza vaccine. Vaccination is recommended three to four weeks after the preceding dose of chemotherapy, when the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts are each 1.0 \u00d7 109/L. Childr en who are no longer receiving chemotherapy can be expected to show seroconversion to vaccine three months after the cessation of chemotherapy. 274 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Note: Seek specialist advice for children who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have discontinued treatment within the past six months. See 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy ' in section 4.3.2. 11.5.3 Adults at increased risk Adults aged 65 years and older In adults aged 65 years and older, influenza vaccine has been shown to be effective against non -fatal and fatal influenza complications, influenza -like illness and laboratory -confirmed influenza (see Table 11.1). Influenza vaccination protects against loss of independence due to increasing levels of frailty associated with hospitalisation.8, 82, 104 Adults with underlying medical conditions Influenza has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in adults with underlying medical conditions. Risk increases with multiple conditions. Note: Seek specialist ad vice for individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have disconti nued treatment within the past six months. See 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy ' in section 4.3.2. 11.5.4 Recommended but not funded Generally, influenza vaccination is recommended annually for all individuals aged from 6 months. It is particularly important for the groups listed in Table 11.2. There are certain conditions that individually do not render a person eligible for funded influenza vaccine, but when combined, significantly i ncrease the risk of influenza complications (this is described as 'risk stacking '). Such risks are further increased by smoking, alcohol dependency and obesity. In order to optimise the protection of high -risk infants and toddlers, including those aged un der 6 months (see Table 11.2), all household and close contacts should receive influenza vaccine (not funded unless eligibility criteria are met). Healthy individuals of any age from 6 months and older Healthy individuals are encouraged to have the vaccine, especially if they are in close contact with individuals at high risk of complications. Employers are encouraged to provide influenza vaccine to avoid illness in their employees, especially those engaged in he alth care and other essential community services. Immunising healthy individuals has been shown to be cost -effective. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 275 Health care workers The Ministry of Health strongly recommends, and expects, that all health care workers will receive annual influenza v accination for their own protection and the protection of those in their care. Travellers Influenza vaccine is recommended for people travelling outside New Zealand, especially those who are in the at -risk groups who have not received vaccine during the p revious autumn, depending on the season and their destination. In tropical countries, influenza activity can occur throughout the year but is more likely during the winter (wet) and summer seasons, while in the northern hemisphere activity is commonest betw een the months of December and March. Outbreaks of influenza among organised tourist groups (eg, on cruise ships) can occur throughout the year. 11.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines, section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines and section 4.3.2 for immune checkpoint inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy, particularly for oncology patients. 11.6.1 Contraindications Influenza vaccine should not be administered to people with a history of an an aphylactic reaction to a prior dose of influenza vaccine or to a vaccine component. Egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, is not a contraindication or precaution: see section 11.6.3 . 11.6.2 Precautions Immune checkpoint inhibitors Specialist advice must be sought before administering any vaccine to individuals who are currently being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as those who have discont inued treatment within the past six months. A cautious approach to vaccination is recommended when balancing an individual 's risk of developing an immune -related adverse event, their potential risks of disease and the potential benefits of vaccination duri ng, and for six months after, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. 276 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 There are four immune checkpoint inhibitor medications in inhibitor (immunostimulant) therapy ' in section 4.3.2. History of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome Influenza vaccination has been suggested to increase the risk of GBS. However, no association was found between administering 16 million doses of influenza vaccine and GBS in adults aged from 65 years in the US.105 Any potential risk increase would be less than one additional case per million doses administered.3, 32, 106 The risk of developing GBS is increased f ollowing influenza infection, and the magnitude of the risk is several times greater than that possibly occurring following influenza vaccination.3, 106, 107 New Zealand hospitalisations for GBS showed no increase during the 1990s despite the marked increase in vaccine use during this period but apparent year -to-year variation was observed. In particular, the doubling of vaccine use (with the introduction of funded vaccine) in 1997 was not associated with a ny increase in GBS hospitalisations. No excess risk for GBS following influenza vaccine in children has been documented. No association between influenza vaccines and any other neurological disease has been substantiated. The risks and benefits of withholdi ng vaccination should be considered on an individual basis, based on the potential morbidity and mortality associated with influenza for that individual, including the potential risk of recurrent GBS following influenza infection. Co-administration with P CV13 Individuals (or their parents/guardians) who receive both influenza vaccine and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) should be advised of the increased risk of fever following concomitant administration of these vaccines.99, 100, 108 Separation of the vaccines by two days can be offered, but is not essential (see also section 16.6.2 ). 11.6.3 Egg allergy Influenza vaccine can be safely administered to people with a history of egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, at general practices, pharmacies or at the workplace.109 Reported cases of anaphylaxis after influenza vaccination in egg -allergic individuals all occurred over 30 years ago, at a time when vaccine egg (ovalbumin) content was much higher than it is now. Recent studies have shown that influenza vaccines containing less than 1 \u00b5g of ovalbumin do not trigger anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals.109 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 277 11.7 Potential responses and AEFIs Split virion or subunit influenza vaccines are generally well tolerated. The safety profile of quadrivalent vaccines is comparable to that of trivalent vaccines.32 Potential responses associated with these influenza vaccines in adults and children include pain, redness and/or swelling at the site of injection (10 -64 percen t of recipients, lasting less than two days).3 These local inflammatory responses a re almost always mild. Systemic events such as headache, muscle aches and fatigue may occur in adults. Passive reporting of local and systemic reactions to influenza vaccines is more frequent for females (both young and older adults) than males.110 Australian surveillance data (collected by AusVaxSafety) found that just over 6 percent of adults reported any adverse event following seasonal influenza vaccination, of which less than 1 percent were systemic responses (fever, rash and seizure).111 Systemic reactions are more likely in children not previously exposed to the vaccine or virus, these are generally self -limiting and resolve within one to two days.32 A large post-licensure study in the US, which reviewed more than 250,000 children aged under 18 years given influenza vaccine, showed no increase in clinically important m edically attended events for two weeks after vaccination compared to control periods.112 In early 2010, an increase in febrile seizures in children in both Australia and New Zealand were all linked to the Fluvax brand influenza vaccine. Active surveillance in Australia continues to monitor for potential safety signals. Vaccinators need to emphasise to recipients that: the split virion vaccine contains components of the virus, not the intact virus, and cannot cause influenza local reaction and mild systemic symptoms may occur within a day or two of immunisation respiratory viral infections are common, and many individuals will deve lop one coincidentally following immunisation, and these should not be falsely attributed to the vaccine. An association was found in 2010 between narcolepsy and one H1N1 pandemic vaccine (Pandemrix, an adjuvanted vaccine not licensed or used in New Zealand). Data from various European countries support a temporal link.113, 114, 115 The onset of narcolepsy may be confounded by other factors, such as genetic predisposition, A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza and/or other environmental factors.116, 117, 118 A 2018 systematic review found that although the risk of narcolepsy type 1 increased in associa tion with this particular vaccine, it remains a rare disease and the benefit of the influenza vaccination outweighs the risk.119 278 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11.8 Public health measures Using influenza signs and symptoms to assess the burden of influenza is of limited value. There is also a significant amount of asymptomatic circulation of influenza in the community. The most sensitive diagnostic method is polymer ase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirate samples. The methods of controlling influenza are: immunisation hand hygiene (ie, regularly washing hands for at least 20 seconds and drying them for 20 seconds, or regularly using a n alcohol -based hand rub) respiratory hygiene (ie, cough and sneeze etiquette, and the judicious use of viricidal tissues and wearing of face masks in some settings) social distancing (ie, persuading those with symptoms to avoid others in the community by staying away from school and work when sick; in particular, infected individuals should avoid contact with the elderly, the chronically ill, and infants and babies) regularly cleaning flat surfaces such as bathroom sinks, bedside cabinets, desks and tablet ops antiviral therapy, but this has a limited role (see section 11.8.2 ). 11.8.1 Improving vaccine uptake Studies in New Zealand and overseas have found that provider attitudes and provider recommendations are key to improving influenza vaccine uptake. Organised registers for recall and opportunistic immunisation are also likely to be important factors in achieving high uptake. Every effort should be made during April to immunise all people at risk, particularly those aged 65 years and older, those aged under 65 years (including children) who have certain medical conditions, pregnant women and health care work ers. During an influenza outbreak, recommend influenza vaccination to anyone at risk who was not immunised during the current season or to those who have not received an influenza vaccination for more than six months. Availability of an appropriate vaccine is the most pertinent of these factors. Vaccination of all healthy adults and children from age 6 months is encouraged but not funded. Adult vaccination, especially for those in close contact with high -risk groups, may be funded by employers. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 279 11.8.2 Antiviral drugs Influenza antiviral drugs can be used to treat or to prevent influenza and can be adjuncts to influenza vaccination. Early use of antivirals , especially within the first 48 hours of illness, can reduce the duration of symptoms and the risk of complic ations from influenza. They are likely to be most effective against severe influenza and for those with high risk comorbidities. It has been shown that when patients with influenza -like illness were treated in primary care with oseltamivir, recovery time was shortened compared with usual care. In older patients and those with comorbidities, in particular, even with longer previous symptom duration (48 -72 hours), recovery was likely to be 2 -3 days sooner following antiviral treatment than it would have been with than standard care alone.120 Meta -analyses of the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating uncomplicated influenza show shortened duration of symptoms for healthy adults and adolescents of around one d ay,121 a 63 percent (95% CI: 19 -83) decrease in risk of hospitalisation for any cause and a 44 percent (95% CI: 25 -58) decrease in risk of antibiotic prescription use.122 For use with severe influenza, observational studies show early treatment can lead to a decreased risk of death.123, 124 Early treatment upon hospital admission was significantly associated with reduced length of stay (b y 19 percent ), regardless of time since symptoms onset, compared with later or no treatment initiation. Greater reductions in length of stay were seen for pregnant women and obese patients (by 39 percent and 27 percent , respectively).125 Antivirals should be particularly considered for unimmunised or recently immunised contacts who are at high risk of severe disease. When used to limit the size of an institutional outbreak, antiviral drugs are usually given for a period of two weeks after immunisation or until one week after the end of the outbreak. Institutional outbreaks should be notified to the local medical officer of health.126 For further details about antiviral medication, refer to the Influenza information for health professionals website at www.influenza.org.nz . 11.8.3 Pandemics At the time of a pandemic, recommended public health advice, priority groups and the timing of vaccination may be quite different from those during inter -pandemic periods. The New Zealand Influenza Pandemic Plan: A framework for action (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/new -zealand -influenza -pandemic -plan- framework -action) describes the key phases of a pandemic and the actions and responsibilities within each phase.127 280 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 11.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet Vaccine data sheets state that the vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a hypersensi tivity to egg protein. However, the Ministry of Health recommends that individuals with hypersensitivity to eggs, including anaphylaxis, may receive influenza vaccination: see section 11.6.3 . References 1.

Measles is one of the most highly communicable of all infectious diseases (R0=12 -18). Incubation period About 10 days but may be 7 -18 days from exposure to onset of fever. The in cubation period may be longer in those given IG after exposure. Period of communicability From 5 days before to 5 days after rash onset, counting the day of rash onset as day 1. Incidence and burden of disease New Zealand was declared free of endemic measles in 2017. Outbreaks continue to occur through imported cases, as occurred in 2019. To prevent recurrent outbreaks of measles, 95 percent of the population must be immune. Funded vaccine MMR (Priorix) is a live attenuated vaccine. Dose, pre sentation, route 0.5 mL per dose after reconstitution. Pre-filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Funded vaccine indications and schedule Children at ages 12 months and 15 months . Adults who are susceptible to one or more of measles, mumps and rubella. This includes all adults born in New Zealand from 1 January 1969 without two documented doses of measles -containing vaccine received after age 12 months . For (re)vaccination following immunosuppression (if the individual is immunocompetent enough to safely receive the vaccine). Recommended All adults born since January 1969 should be up to date with two doses of MMR or have evidence of immunity to all three va ccine components. It is particularly important for health care workers, individuals who work with children, armed forces personnel, staff of correctional facilities, long-term care facilities and immigration/refugee centres and laboratory staff. All vaccin e-eligible travellers, particularly to high risk countries. Vaccine effectiveness Measles vaccines are around 95 percent effective after 1 dose and 99 percent effective after two doses. Duration of protection Two doses are anticipated to provide lifelong protection. Protection is best achieved through herd immunity from high immunisation coverage. Contraindications MMR is contraindicated for immunocompromised individuals is contraindicated for anaphylaxis to neomycin . Precautions and special considerations See section 12.6 for cautions around receipt of blood products and other live vaccines, and other precautions. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 289 Potential res ponses to vaccine MMR is generally well tolerated. Fever and rash 6 -12 days after vaccination. Salivary gland swelling and joint pain is possible due to mumps and rubella components. Public health measures Notify the local medical officer of health immedi ately on suspicion of wild-type measles. Prevent measles transmission through exclusion and use of personal protective equipment. Promote immunisation to susceptible individuals. Post-exposure prophylaxis Management of contacts of measles cases should be discussed with the medical officer of health. 12.1 Virology The measles virus is an RNA virus, from the genus Morbillivirus , in the family Paramyxoviridae. Humans are the only natural host for the measles virus. The virus has a survival time of arou nd two hours and is rapidly inactivated by sunlight, heat and extremes of pH.1 12.2 Clinical features Measles is transmitted by airborne spread as well as direct contact with infectious droplets. It is one of the most highly communicable of all infectious diseases, wit h an approximate basic reproductive number of 12 -18 in high -income countries2 (see section 1.2.1). There is a prodromal phase of two to four days with fever, conjunctivitis, coryza and Koplik 's spots on the buccal mucosa. The characteristic maculopapular rash classically appears first beh ind the ears on the third to seventh day, spreads over three to four days from the head and face, over the trunk to the extremities. It lasts for up to one week. The patient is most unwell during the rst day or two after the appearance of the rash. The incubation period is about 10 days, but may be 7 -18 days, from exposure to onset of fever, and about 14 days, but may be 7 -21 days, from exposure to onset of rash. Measles is highly infectious from five days before to five days after rash onset, counti ng the day of rash onset as day one. Incubation may be longer in those given IG after exposure or in infants with residual maternal antibody and can present as a modified, attenuated measles with a mild prodrome and a sparse discrete rash of short duration .3 Complications are common, occurring in 10 percent of cases, and include otitis media, pneumonia, croup and diarrhoea. Encephalitis has been reported in 1 in every 1,000 cases, of whom some 15 percent die and a further 2 5-35 percent are left with permanent neurological damage. Other complications of measles include bronchiolitis, 290 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Measles infection causes acute immune suppression of the cellular and humoral immunity that leads to the depletion of immunological memory and antibody repertoire. This loss in immunity increases the long -term risk of further infections requiring med ical treatment.4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Although there are potential implications for long term effects on immune memory of individuals who have had measles, currently, there is no evidence to recommend reimmunisation. Sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare but fatal degenerative central nervous system disease resulting fro m persistent measles virus infection. It typically occurs 7 -11 years after wild -type measles infection, at an estimated rate of 4 -11 per 100,000 measles cases with higher incidence if measles occurs before 2 years of age.9 Recent literature shows that SSPE is under -reported or under -diagnosed in the US.10 Cases have occurred following undiagnosed measles or clinically mild disease, particularly when immunisation coverage has been low or where i nfants too young to have been immunised have acquired the infection while travelling to endemic regions.11, 12 The case -fatality rate for reported cases of measles in the US is 1 -3 per 1,000.9 Pneumonia is responsible for approximately 60 percent of deaths, more commonly in young patients. Measles is particularly severe and has a much higher case -fatality rate in the malnourished children with vitamin A deficiency, which is further exacerbated by diarrhoea; in patients with defective cell -mediated i mmunity, who may develop giant cell pneumonia or encephalitis without evidence of rash;9 and in pregnant women .9 Measles during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm delivery.1 Measles is also serious in health y children: over half of all the children who died from measles in the UK between 1970 and 1983 were previously healthy.13 No other conditi ons were reported as contributing to the death of seven people who died from measles in the 1991 New Zealand epidemic. 12.3 Epidemiology 12.3.1 Global burden of disease Mortality and morbidity From 2000 to 2016, the annual reported measles incidence decreased by 75 percent worldwide, from 146 to 35 cases per million population, due to increased vaccine coverage.14 Annual worldwide estimated measles deaths was 89,780 in 2016, representing an 84 percent decline since 2000.15 However, there was a worldwide increase in disease during 2019. Over 1.3 million confirmed and suspected cases of measles were reported to WHO from 187/194 member states, resulting from multiple outbreaks, including in the previously meas les- free Americas.16 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 291 Although measles mortality rates have fallen significantly,17 measles remains an important vaccine -preventable ca use of death among children throughout the world, particularly in low -income countries in Africa and Asia. The disease is highly infectious in non-immune communities, with epidemics occurring approximately every second year. During 2019, the countries with the highest number of cases were Philippines, Madagascar, India, Ukraine, the Nigeria and Brazil.16 The incidence rate in Samoa was almost 10 times that observed in New Zealand (4525 versus 476 per million population). In Samoa, around 1.5 percent of cases died and one -third were hospitalised (there were 83 deaths, 5,707 cases and 1,8 68 hospitalised as of 20 January 2020).18 Measles elimination When a country is verified by the Measles Regional Verification Commission as having eliminated measles, it means that the country interrupted transmission of the endemic strain of circulating measles virus for a period of 36 months. Importations of measles virus may have occurred during this period, but circulation of the imported strains of measles virus was interrupted within 12 months of the importation.19 In May 2012 th e 194 member states of the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011 -2020 ,20 which aimed to eliminate measles in at least four WHO regions by 2015 and in five WHO regions by 2020. In September 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first WHO region to be declared free of endemic measles and New Zealand was verified as having eliminated measles in 2017. Disappointingly, no region has sustained measles elimination. Measles cases were reported to have climbed by 300 percent globally in the first three months of 2019.21 For example, four European countries (Albania, Czechia, Greece and the UK) lost measles elimination status and the US reported it highest number of cases in 25 years.22 Global coverage for the first measles vaccine dose has stalled at 85 percent and for the second doses at 67 percent , falling short of the 95 percent required to prevent outbreaks.21 12.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Measles vaccine was introduced in in New Zealand in 1969 and moved to a two -dose schedule (as a combined MMR vaccine) in 1992. Measles became a notifiable disease in 1996. The two -dose schedule at ages 15 months and 4 years was introduced in 2001 (see Appendix 1 for more information about the history of the Schedule) and was changed in 2020 to 12 months and 15 months following the 2019 outbreaks. Historical holes in coverage, due to a combination of issues including historically low immunisation cov erage in the childhood programme, unfounded vaccine safety concerns at the turn of the 21st century, changes to the schedule for MMR dose 2 from age 11 years to 4 years and compromised vaccine due to lack of adequate cold chain processes prior to 2004 have meant that young adults and adolescents (ages 15 -30 years), in particular, are under immunised against measles.23 292 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Prior to the introduction of two -dose MMR schedule, measles epidemics occurred in 1991 (the number of cases was estimated to be in the tens of thousands) and 1997 (when 2,169 cases were identified). In 2019, nine outbreaks occurred, six were linked to imported cases from the Philippines, Japan, Thailand, Australia and Singapore. In 2019, 2,213 cases were notified, of which 775 were hospitalised (ESR, 8 Jun e 2020). The worst affected region was Counties Manukau DHB, which had 1,174 cases, many of whom were of Mori and Pacific ethnicity, children too young to be immunised and unimmunised young adults.24 Importation of measles by non -immune people who had travelled overseas was also linked to the smaller measles outbreaks in New Zealand in 2 009, 2011, 2014 and 2016 (see Figure 12.1; see also section 12.5.5 ). Figure 12.1: Number of m easles notifications by month reported, January 2009 to December 2019 Source: ESR To eliminate measles epidemics, modelling suggests that New Zealand needs to achieve a coverage level of 90 percent or greater for both doses of MMR.25 If this coverage level is achieved and maintained in those aged 12 month s to 50 years, elimi nation of measles can be maintained. In quarter ending 31 December 2019, the 5-year-old immunisation coverage rate (ie, fully immunised with two doses of MMR) was 89 percent - nearing a target of 90 percent . For details of measles notifications, refer to the most recent measles and notifiable disease reports from ESR (available IMMUNISATION 2020 293 12.4 Vaccines 12.4.1 Available vaccines The measles vaccine is only ava ilable as one of the components of MMR. This vaccine is a freeze -dried preparation containing live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella viruses. Funded vaccine Each dose of the reconstituted MMR (Priorix, GSK) contains: not attenuated line of Schwarz strain measles, propagated in chick embryo tissue culture not less than 103.7 CCID50 of RIT 4385 mumps strain, derived from the Jeryl Lynn strain and propagated in chick embryo tissue culture not less than 103.0 CCI D50 of the Wistar RA 27/3 rubella strains, propagated in MRC5 human diploid lactose, acids supplement, mannitol, sorbitol and neomycin sulphate as excipients, and water for injection. Other vaccines M-M-R II (MSD) was the funded vaccine prior to the 1 July 2017 Schedule change. It contains a attenuated line of measles virus derived from Enders ' attenuated Edmonston strain; the Jeryl Lynn (B of mumps virus; and the Wistar RA 27/3 vaccines (MMRV: see chapter 22) are also registered but not currently available in New Zealand: Priorix -Tetra HANDBOOK 2020 12.4.2 and effectiveness Measles vaccines are highly efficacious, and immunisation programmes have c ontrolled measles to the point of elimination in many populations.26 Outbreaks and epidemics continue to occur where low immunisation rates and/or sufficient numbers of susceptible members of communities are present. A 2012 Cochrane review of the safety and effectiveness of MMR conclud ed that a single dose of MMR is at least 95 percent effective in preventing clinical measles and 92 percent effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts aged 6 months and older.27 This was a systematic review of clinical trials and studies, which involved approximately 14.7 million children. Seroconversion to all three viruses of MMR occurs in 85 -100 percent of recipients. 'Primary vaccine failure ' refers to the lack of protective immunity despite vacci nation. It is due to failure of the vaccine to stimulate an immune response. This occurs in 5 -10 percent of recipients after the rst dose and is rare after a second dose. More than 99 percent of people who receive two MMR doses (given at least four weeks apart, with the first dose given after age 12 months) develop serologic evidence of immunity to measles.9 Two doses are required for measles control and elimination in populations.9 The second MMR dose is not a boos ter: it is given to increase vaccine efficacy to 98 percent and address primary vaccine failure. Measles vaccination may have nonspecific effects, reducing mortality from other infectious diseases. Infection with the measles virus causes immune memory loss and predispose people to opportunistic infections for more than three years.5, 7, 8 Population -level data from the UK, U S and Denmark indicates that when measles was common, measles virus infections could have been implicated in as many as half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease.8 The reduction in measles infections is suggested to be the main factor in reducing overall childhood infectious disease mortality after the introduction of vaccination. Duration of immunity Even though antibody levels decline over time, secondary vaccine failure (ie, vaccine failure due to waning of protective immunity) has been documented for measles but remains rare.28 There were three cases in the rec ent New Zealand outbreak with documented secondary vaccine failure but no transmission was recorded from these cases. Breakthrough cases, as a result of secondary vaccine failure, appear to be attenuated and less likely to be hospitalised.29 In Finland in 1982 a cohort was recruited at the start of the national MMR vaccination programme to study the persistence of vaccine -induced antibodies. By the mid -1990s Finland had elim inated measles, mumps and rubella, and there was little opportunity for natural boosting to occur. The follow -up of this cohort has shown that while antibodies wane over time, 20 years after the second MMR dose, 95 percent of people remained seropositive f or measles.30 The antibody avidity also decreased by 8 percent for measles.31 Waning of both the concentration and the avidity of antibodies might contribute to measles infections occurring in individuals who have received two doses of MMR. Waning in immunity was suggested in a small proportion of vaccinated cases (less than 1 percent) in the 31 -42 year age group reported in an outbreak in Berlin.32 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 295 12.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) C. Do not freeze. MMR must be reconstituted only with the diluents supplied by the manufacturer. Use MMR as soon as possible after reconstitution. If storage is necessary, reconstituted vaccine can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C for up to eight hours. 12.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of MMR is all of the reconstituted vaccine (approximately 0.5 mL) administered by intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection if indicated (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines MMR can be given concurrently with other vaccines, as long as separate syringes are used, and the injections are given at different sites. If not given concurrently, live vaccines should be given at least four weeks apart. (See also section 2.2.7 for information about multiple injections at the same visit .) Note t hat TST/Mantoux testing for tuberculosis must be deferred by at least four weeks after MMR if not given concurrently (see section 12.6.2 ). Interchangeability The tw o brands of MMR (Priorix and M -M-RII) may be used interchangeably for completion of a course.33 296 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 12.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Table 12.1: Recommended MMR vaccination schedule Schedule Usual childhood schedulea 2 doses: at ages 12 months and 15 months Catch -upb for children, adolescents and adults 2 doses: at least 4 weeks apart a. If MMR is given to children aged 6 -11 months for outbreak control, 2 further MMR doses are still required at age 12 months (given at least 4 weeks since the previous dose) and 15 months. b. For those born from 1 January 1969 who do not have documented evidence of two doses of a MMR - containing vaccine given after age 1 year, or who do not have serological evidence of protection for measles, mumps and rubella. See section 12.5.2 . 12.5.1 Usual childhood schedule A two -dose MMR vaccination schedule (with appropriate documentation) is recommended irrespective of a history of measles, mumps or rubella in fection or measles immunisation. A clinical history does not reliably indicate immunity. Positive serology for measles cannot be used as a proxy for mumps or rubella immunity. There are no known ill effects from vaccinating children, even if they have had serologically conrmed infection with any of the viruses. Measles vaccine is recommended as MMR at age 12 and 15 months. Two doses of measles vaccine are recommended because nearly all the approximately 5 percent who fail to be protected by the rst dose will be protected by the second.9 The second dose of measles vaccin e can be given as soon as four weeks after the rst dose. MMR vaccination when aged under 12 months A dose of MMR (called MMR0 [zero]) may be recommended for infants aged 6 -11 months during measles outbreaks if cases are occurring in the very young (see section 12.8). These children still require a further two doses of MMR at ages 12 months (given at least four weeks after previous dose) and 15 months because their immune response and long -term protection from measles is less when the vaccine is given at a younger age.34, 35 Any recommendations in this regard will be made by the local medical ofcer of health and the Ministry of Health based on local epidemiology. Note: Some immigrant children may have received a measles -containing vaccine when aged under 12 months . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 297 12.5.2 Catch -up Two doses of documented MMR (at least four weeks apart) are recommended and funded for any child, adolescent or adult who is known to be susceptible to one or more of the three diseases. A second dose of MMR should be given at least four weeks after MMR1 to all children who are older than 15 months but have not yet received their second MMR dose (ie, those who would have been due their second dose at age 4 years). Adults born in New Zealand prior to the introduction of measles vaccine in 1969 are considered immune to measles as circulating virus and disease were highly prevalent at that time. Adults born from 1 January 1969 All individuals born in 1969 or later who have documented evidence of two doses of MMR given after age 12 months or who have serological evidence of protection for measles are considered immune to measles. Some adults may have received one dose of measles -containing vaccine and one dose of MMR or MR during one of the catch -up campaigns (eg, the 1997 campaign, when all those aged up to 10 years were offered MMR, or from international schedules). They will have therefore received the recommended two doses of measles vaccine, but only one of mumps and rubella vaccines. While the main reason for a two -dose MMR schedule is to protect against measles, two doses of all three antigens is recommended and funded. These individuals can receive a second dose of MMR (ie, a third dose of measles vaccine) without any concerns. It is important that women of childbearing age are immune to rubella (see chapter 19). All persons born from 1 January 1969 with only one documented dose of prior MMR should receive a further dose of MMR; if ther e are no documented doses of prior MMR or documented evidence of immunity, then two doses should be administered, at least four weeks apart. Occupational risk groups Certain occupational groups are at increased risk of exposure to measles; particularly those who travel frequently, such as military personnel and cruise ship staff and aircrew (in this case MMR is funded for those eligible for New Zealand health services). See Table 4.8 for details of relevant occupational groups. 298 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 12.5.3 Immunocompromise Contacts of immunocompromised individuals In general, MMR is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3). These people can be partially protected from exposure to infection by ensuring that all their close contacts, including hospital staff and family members, are fully immunised (this is funded), including hospital staff and family members, through cocoon strategies. There is no risk of transmission of MMR vaccine viruses from a vaccine recipient to an immunocompromised individual. See section 12.7.2 . See also 'Vaccination of close contacts of immunocompromised individuals ' in section 4.3.1 for general vaccination information for contacts of immunocompromised individuals. (Re)vaccination before or following immunosuppression MMR is funded to be given at least 28 days before planned immunosuppression. For vaccination or revaccination following immunosuppression (funded), it is important to be sure that the individual is immunocompetent enough to safely receive the vaccine. HIV infection Discuss vaccination of individua ls with HIV infection with their specialist (see 'HIV infection ' in section 4.3.12 ). Receipt of MMR, on time at age 12 and 15 months, is recommended for asymptomatic children who are not severely immunocompromised. MMR is recommended for all HIV-positive individuals aged from 12 months, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, if their CD4+ lymphocyte level is over 15 percent or CD4+ lymphocyte count is at least 200 cells/mm3. Administration of MMR with CD4+ counts below these recommended levels has been associated with vaccine -related pneumonitis (from the measles component).9 12.5.4 Pregnancy and breastfeeding MMR is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after MMR vaccination.1, 9 After delivery If MMR and Rhesus anti -D IG are required after delivery, both the vaccine and anti -D IG may be given at the same time, in separate sites with separate syringes. The vaccine may be given at any t ime after the delivery. Anti -D IG does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine, but whole blood transfusion does inhibit the response in up to 50 percent of vaccine recipients (see section A6.4.1 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 299 MMR can be given (See also sections 4.1.3, 12.6.1 and 19.5.3 .) 12.5.5 Travel International travel is an important factor in reintroducing measles into New Zealand. To avoid importing measles to New Zealand, vaccination with MMR is recommended for all children aged 12 months and older and adults travelling overseas if they have not previously been adequately vaccinated (see Appendix 2 for planning catch -up immunisations). Infants aged 6 -11 months can receive one dose of MMR (as MMR0) if they a re travelling to a country with an active measles outbreak (see section 12.5.1 ). Measles remains endemic in many countries, including areas in Europ e, Asia, the Pacific and Africa, and outbreaks are ongoing worldwide. A high rate of measles incidence was reported in the Philippines during 2019 and early 2020.36 During January to October 2019, 52 (64 percent ) out of 81 imported measles cases in the US were residents returning from travel abroad and 73 (90 percent ) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Eight outbreaks (85 percent of cases of the resulting 1,259 cases) were associated with unvaccinated close -knit populations, such as the Orthodox Jewish community in New York; these began from two single imported cases.37 Travel was also linked to the measles outbreaks in New Zealand in 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2019. 12.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general vaccine contraindicati ons. 12.6.1 Contraindications The general contraindications that apply to all immunisations are relevant to MMR (eg, children with an acute febrile illness should have their immunisation deferred). Anaphylaxis following a previous dose of MMR or any of the vaccine components is a contraindication to a further dose of MMR. Individuals who have anaphylaxis after receiving MMR should be serologically tested for immunity and referred to, or discussed with, a specialist if they are non -immune to rubella or measle s. 300 IMMUNISATION is contraindicated for: those with proven anaphylaxis to the vaccine or vaccine component (eg, neomycin or gelatin) immunocompromised individuals (ie, those with signicantly impaired cell -mediated immunity, such as those with untreated malignancy or altered immunity as a result of drug therapy, including high -dose steroids, or receiving high -dose radiotherapy) (see section 4.3) individuals who have received a nother live vaccine, including BCG, within the previous 4 weeks unless given concurrently (for BCG, see chapter 21) pregnant women - pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after immunisation1, 9see section 19.5.3 ) individuals who have received IG or a blood transfusion during the preceding 11 months (see Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 for the length of time to defer measles vaccine after specic blood products) those with severe immune deficiency from HIV, because vaccine -related pneumonitis (from the measles component) has been reported9 - discuss vaccination of individuals with HIV infection with their specialists. Note: Inadvertent immunisation with a rubella -containing vaccine in early pregnancy is no longe r considered an indication for termination of pregnancy. There have been no cases of teratogenic damage from vaccine virus despite intensive surveillance in the US, the UK and Germany.38 12.6.2 Precautions Children with a history of seizures should be given MMR, but the parents/guardians should be warned that there may be a febrile response. In the case of children with current ITP, the timing of vaccination should be discussed with their specialist. Women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for the next four weeks after MMR vaccination (see section 19.5.3 ).1, 9 Measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin skin test (TST/Mantoux) reactivity, so if required, a TST should be placed on the same d ay as MMR vaccination or be postponed for four to six weeks after vaccination.9 TST is not a prerequisite for measles vaccination. An individual with active TB should be established on treatment before administering MMR. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 301 12.6.3 Egg allergy The measles and mumps components of the MMR are manufactured in chick embryo cell culture, so there may be trace amounts of egg prot ein in the vaccine. Egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, is not a contraindication to measles -containing vaccines. Various studies have conrmed that children with egg allergy can be vaccinated safely.9, 39, 40 Other components of the vaccine may be responsible for allergic reactions.41 Individuals with egg allergy may therefore be safely vaccinated in primary care.42 12.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 12.7.1 Potential responses Some children, around 5 -15 percent , may experience fever of 39.4\u00b0C or more between 6 and 12 days after immunisation that generally lasts one to two days and is associated with a strong measles antibody resp onse.9, 43 Rash, often with atypical distribution, can occur in approximately 5 percent of vaccine recipients at the same interval post - vaccination: these individuals are not infectious to others.9 Fevers, rashes and other systemic symptoms can occur coincidentally after vaccination due to common childhood infections and are not caused by the vaccine.44 Serological tests or PCR can be expected to be positive if performed during this time, so testing should not be routinely performed. During an outbreak, genotyping the sample can help to identify vaccine s train versus wild type disease. The mumps vaccine may produce parotid and/or submaxillary swelling in about 1 percent of vaccine recipients, most often 10 -14 days after immunisation.45 The rubella vaccine can cause a mild rash, fever, joint pain and lymphadenopathy between one and three weeks after immunisation.9, 46 There were no persisting sequelae associated with the administration of 3 million doses of MMR to 1.5 million children in Finland.44, 47 12.7.2 AEFIs causality has not been established.48 302 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vaccine virus transmission MMR vaccine viruses are regarded as being non -transmissible from vaccine recipients. Two historical, poorly documented case of transmission (of a rubella and a mumps vaccine strain) were reported from a vaccine that is no longer in production.49 Following immunisation with both measles and rubella vaccines, live virus has been isolated rarely from pharyngeal secretions.38, 50 There have been no conrmed cases of disease transmission from MMR vaccine viruses. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura MMR is the only c hildhood vaccine with an elevated risk of ITP, which occurs in 1 in 25,000 to 40,000 people, 15 days to six weeks after immunisation.9 ITP is mild and transient, resolving within six months in 93 percent of cases.1, 51 If ITP occurs, measles, mumps and rubella serology should be measured, and if the individual is immune to all three infections, a second dose is not required. However, if the individual is susceptible to any of the three infections, a second dose should b e administered.52, 53, 54 The risk of thrombocytopenia is higher after the first dose of vaccine than after the second dose and is much rarer after vaccination than after wild -type infection.9 12.7.3 Adverse outcomes not linked to MMR Over three decades, multiple published epidemiological studies in the UK,55 Finland56 and elsewhere27 have conrmed that there is no link between MMR and the development of autism in young children (see section 3.2.4 for further discussion on this issue). 12.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of measles be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health - do not wait for a laboratory confirmation as this can delay contact tracing and allow outbreaks to become established if disease is confirmed . 12.8.1 Diagnosis A single case of measles should be considered an outbreak and result in an appropriate outbreak response. Practitioners should have a low index of suspicion for notification, and all suspected clinical cases should be self -isolated immediately and notified to the medical officer of health. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 303 The standard clinical case definition for measles is 'an illness characterised by all of the following: generalised maculopapular rash, starting behind the ears then on the head and neck; fever (at least 38\u00b0C if measured) present at the time of rash onset; and cough or coryza or conjunctivitis or Koplik 's spots present at the time of rash onset '. It is important that the diagnosis be laboratory confirmed, as many viral infections can mimic measles. In the first instance, a nasopharyngeal and throat swab sh ould be taken for viral identification by PCR. Further testing should be discussed with a clinical microbiologist. For instructions on measles specimen collection and transport, see the National Measles Laboratory website ( www.measles.co.nz ). For more details on diagnosis, refer to the 'Measles ' chapter of the online Communicable Disease of a measles case should be discussed with the local medical officer of health. MMR vaccination A single dose of MMR when given to an unvaccinated person within 72 hours of first contact with an infectious person may reduce the risk of developing disease as post exposure prophylaxis.1 If there is doubt about vaccination status, MMR should still be given. MMR will not exacerbate the symptoms of measles if a person is already incubating the disease, but in these situations, any measles -like illness occurring shortly after vaccination is likely to be due to infection. If MMR is not given within 72 hours of first exposure, it should still be offered at any later interva l to provide protection from future exposures, unless the vaccine is contraindicated. In an outbreak, the use of MMR for infants aged 6 -11 months should be considered. If MMR0 is vaccine is given to an infant aged under 12 months, two more doses are still required from age 12 months and at least four weeks apart. This is because the seroconversion rate is lower when MMR is administered to an infant aged under 12 months. Similarly, to optimise early protection, toddlers should be give both doses of MMR four weeks apart. 304 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Human normal immunoglobulin prophylaxis for contacts Human (HNIG; Normal Immunoglobulin -VF) is recommended for measles -susceptible individuals in whom the vaccine is contraindicated (see section 12.6) and susceptible pregnant contacts. For these individuals, HNIG is given to attenuate disease and should be given as soon as possible, up to a maximum of six days after exposure. All o ther susceptible contacts should be offered MMR as post - exposure prophylaxis (as described above). HNIG provides no benefit to those who are already exhibiting symptoms of measles. HNIG may be recommended for the following contacts of measles cases as so on as possible and up to six days after exposure: immunocompromised or immune -deficient people susceptible pregnant women immune -competent infants aged under 6 months: because maternal antibody wanes in the first six months of life, evidence of maternal vaccination status or serology tests may not predict protection for these infants. Maternal serology may be helpful for neon ates. The role of an infant measles IgG test is unclear but may be helpful if available rapidly. Discuss use of HNIG for these infants with a paediatrician immune -competent children aged between 6 and 12 months, who are outside the 72-hour exposure window for MMR vaccination infants born prematurely <28 weeks ' gestation are considered non -immune irrespective of maternal immune status . For further details for infants under 6 months and immunocompromised children refer to the Starship Child Health guidelines (available at www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/measles ). The recommended dose for pregnant women and immunocompromised or immunodeficient people is 0.6 mL/kg intramuscularly, to a maximum dose of 15 mL, usually administered as three 5 mL injections. Prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG (Intragam immunosuppressed and immune -deficient measles contacts (who may, for example, have a central venous catheter ); individuals with reduced muscle bulk; those whom intramuscular injection is contraindicated; or in individuals for whom large doses are required (see Appendix 6 for more information about passive immunisation). IVIG is not given if a person is already symptomatic. See the guidance from the Public Health England for further information (available at www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles -post-exposure -prophylaxis ).58 Queries regarding usage and dosage of IVIG for measles prophylaxis can be directed to the New Zealand Blood Service transfusion medicine specialists via the DHB blood bank. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 305 12.8.3 Exclusion Exclusion of measles cases or contacts should be discussed with the lo cal medical officer of health. Parents/guardians should be advised that children who are suspected or confirmed measles cases should be excluded from early childhood services, school or community gatherings until at least five days after the appearance of the rash. Immune contacts (considered to be children aged under 15 months who have received one dose of measles -containing vaccine on or after their first birthday and children aged 15 months and older who have received two doses) need not be excluded fr om these settings. Non -immune (susceptible) contacts should be excluded because of the risk of developing the disease themselves, and the risk of passing on the disease during the prodromal phase to other susceptible children. Advise susceptible contacts to avoid attending school, early childhood services or community gatherings, and to avoid contact with other susceptible individuals, until 14 days after the last exposure to the infectious case. Given that post -exposure MMR vaccination cannot guarantee pr otection, susceptible contacts who have received their first MMR vaccination within the 72 -hour period after first exposure should also be excluded for 14 days after the last exposure to the infectious case (unless they subsequently meet the criteria for i mmunity). Contacts who have previously received one documented dose of MMR and then receive their second dose of MMR within 72 hours after first exposure can go back to school or work. Individuals who have received IG prophylaxis should also be excluded f or 14 days after the last exposure to the infectious case. Acceptable evidence of immunity: was born before 1 January 1969 has documentation of previous immunity or previous infection for children aged 12 months to under 15 months: has documentation of at least one dose of measles -containing vaccine after their first birthday for individuals aged 15 months and older: has documentation of two doses of measles -containing vaccine, given at least one month apart and given from 12 months of a ge. For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Measles ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual57 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 12.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet The vaccine data sheet recommends a single dose of MMR. However, as 2 -5 percent of recipients fail to seroconvert after the rst dose (see section 12.4.2 ), the Ministry of Health recommends and funds a second dose of MMR. Two doses are required for measles control and elimination;9 the second MMR dose is not a booster. The vaccine data sheet states that individuals who have experienced anap hylaxis after egg ingestion should be vaccinated with extreme caution, with adequate treatment for anaphylaxis on hand should such a reaction occur. However, various studies have confirmed that egg -allergic children can be vaccinated safely.9, 39, 40 The Ministry of Health recommends that individuals with egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, may be safely vaccinated in primary care (see section 12.6.3 ).

MenC: effectiveness of 83 -100%; group C incidence reduce by 90% in post population -wide programmes; persistence of protection may be partially due to herd effects as antibody wanes within 2 -3 years. 4CMenB: based on bactericidal antibody levels and circulating meningococcal B strains, protection is estimated as 63 -100% in under 2-year olds, 72 -100% in 2 -3-year olds and 91 -100% in older children and adults. UK data over 3 years post programme implementa tion observed a 75% reduction in group B cases in infants. Potential responses to vaccines MenC and MenACWY: localised pain, irritability, headache and fatigue, mild fever . 4CMenB: increased risk of fever and fever -related events in children <2 years (pro phylaxic paracetamol advised). Older age groups: localised pain, nausea, myalgia, malaise, mild fever and headache . Contraindications No specific contraindications or precautions, except prior anaphylaxis to vaccine components. Public health measures All cases must be notified if clinically suspected. Parenteral antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible before admission to hospital or in hospital if delays of longer than 30 minutes are likely. Post-exposure prophylaxis For chemop rophylaxis of contacts see section is caused by , a gram -negative bacterium, causing sepsis, meningitis and some less common clinical syndromes. Groups B, W and C are currently the most important types in New Zealand. Increasingly, group W and Y organisms are the cause of bacteraemia and pneumonia in the elderly. Predominant groups differ between countries; group A is an important epidemic strain, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. Meningococci are spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions from a carrier or case. 312 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 13.2 Clinical features Table 13.1 below describes the symptoms and signs of meningococcal disease - individuals may present with some or all of these. Meningococcal septicaemia is more common than meningitis, and presentation varies from a mild non -specific illness to rapid progression with fatal outcome. Symptoms and signs in infants are frequently non-specific. The classical rapidly progressing petechial or purpuric rash may not be present or may initially appear maculopapula r. Atypical initial presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis and epiglottitis, are more frequently reported with meningococcal W disease, and may contribute to delayed diagnosis and increased case -fatality.1, 2 Pneumonia is more frequently reported with group Y. Table 13.1: Symptoms and signs of meningococcal disease Adolescents and adults Young infants and children Sepsis syndrome, including poor peripheral perfusion and tachycardia Nausea/vomiting Meningeal signs Rash - petechial/purpuric, but may be maculopapular; rash may not be present early and absent in about one-third of cases Sleepy, difficult to rouse Occasionally in young adults, irrational behaviour Arthralgia, myalgia, leg pain Atypical presentation (particularly group W) may include pneumonia, septic arthritis, myocarditis or diarrhoea As for adolescents and adults, plus the following: bulging fontanelle tachycardia altered responsiveness irritability and/or floppiness refusing drinks or feeds poor peripheral perfusion atypical presentation may include epiglottis, diarrhoea or septic arthritis Notify all suspected cases urgently to local medical officer of health, including out -of-hours. Meningococcal disease covers a spectrum, from persistent fever with or without rash and arthritis to rapidly progressive purpuric rash and shock. Meningitis can occur with and without signs of sepsis. In fulminant cases, coma and death can occur within a few hours despite appropriate treatment. Because of the potential for rapid progression, antibiotics should be administered (Table 13.2) as soon as possible before hospital admission. Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on information accompanying the patient to hospital.

The highest burden of disease occurs in sub -Saharan Africa, where despite a dramatic fall in Group A disease following introduction of a Group A conjugate vaccine this 'meningitis belt ', epidemics contin ue with around 30,000 cases reported annually, now including Group W. The incidence in Canada, the US and Europe varies substantially from 0.2 to 3 per 100,000 persons per year.3 Group B has become the predominant capsular group in Europe, Americas and Australia, with incidence typically hi ghest in children aged under 2 years.4 Group C disease has almost disappeared in countries with universal immunisation programmes, but outbreaks have been observed in men who have sex with men in the US and Europe. Since 2009 there has been an emerging global incidence of Group W disease, initially in the United Kingdom and South America. Australia has experienced a rapid increase in Group W cases since 2013 with New Zealand also seeing a rapid increase in cases since 2017. Like group C clonal complex ST11 strains, group W ST11 strains have enhanced virulence. Higher rates of carriage of these ST11 strains has been noted within age groups where invasive group W disease is more prevalent (infants and the elde rly).5 Some parts of the world, particularly in Scandinavia, have reported an increase in group Y disease. In other regions, there is evidence of colonisation, but disease caused by group Y is rare. Patients with group Y strain disease are more likely to develop pneumonia and to be elderly than other strains.3, 4 This emergence of group W and Y strains has led to meningococcal C vaccines being replaced by quadrivalent (group A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MenACW Y). 314 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Risk groups The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in children aged under 5 years (especially under 2 years) with a secondary peak in older adolescents (15 -19 years). The age distribution for groups W and Y is more likely to include older people that for B and C . A pooled overall case -fatality rate of 8.3 percent (range 4.1 -20 percent ) is reported internationally, varying by group and age.6 Most infection occurs in healthy people, but those with certain rare immune deciencies (terminal components of complement (C5 -9) or properdin) or asplenia are at much higher risk, particularly of recurrent meningococcal disease. Individuals with infection caused by groups other than A, B, C, W, Y and untypeable strains or who experience recurrent disease should be investigated. Close contacts of primary cases of meningococcal infection are at increased risk of developing infection, such as the case 's household,7 early childhood education services, semi-closed communities, schools, correctional fac ilities and military recruit camps. Students living in hostel accommodation may also be at higher risk.8, 9, 10 In health care settings, only those with close exposure to oropharyngeal secretions of patients with meningococcal disease (as may occur during intubation or resuscitation) and microbiology laboratory workers are considered to be at increased risk. It is not possible to calculate the incubation period for meningococcal disease for sporadic cases. Secondary cases (ie, in contacts of known cases of meningococcal disease) usually occur within four days, but it can be up to 10 days. The infectivity of patients with meningococcal disease is markedly reduced after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy, although treatment with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, rifampicin or ciprofloxacin is necessary to reliably eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage and hence relax infection prevention and control precautions (see section 13.8.2 ). In high -income countries in the absence of immunisation, nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis occurs in approximately 10 percent of the overall population, rising from 2 percent in ch ildren aged under 4 years to a peak of 24.5 percent to 32 percent among 15 -24-year-olds, then declining with increasing age.3, 11 In adolescents and young adults, the overall and capsular group carriage vary between re gions and age groups.12 The relationship between risk factors for disease and those associated with carriage is incompletely understood.3 Carriage prevalence does not predict the disease incidence nor the occurrence or severity of outbreaks, as most of the carried strains are non-encapsulated and do not cause disease.3 Smoking, passive smoking, household crowding and upper respiratory tract infections increase carriage. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 315 13.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Incidence and mortality In 2019 the notification rate for meningococcal disease was 2.8 cases per 100,000 population, with a total of 139 cases notified (134 laboratory -confirmed; ESR, 8 June 2020). Cases have increased since 2014, but remain significantly lower than the peak annual incidence rate of 16.7 per 100,000 for all ages and 200 per 100,000 in children under 12 months as experienced in 2001 during the meningococcal epidemic from 1991 to 2007. The epidemic was largely due to a s ingle Group B subtype (B:4:P1.7b,4). The annual number of notified cases of meningococcal disease in New Zealand since 1970 is shown in Figure 13.1. For further detail s and reports of meningococcal disease in New Zealand refer to the ESR surveillance reports (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). Figure 13.1: of meningococcal disease, 1970 Source: ESR Meningococcal disease incidence is about three -fold higher in Pacific people (9.2 per 100,000, 29 cases in 2019) and two -fold higher in Mori (6.1 per 100,00 0, 47 cases) compared with the total population. Household crowding is an important risk factor for meningococcal disease, independent of ethnicity.13 In 2019, the highest age -specific disease rates were among those aged under 1 year (52.0 per 100,000, 31 cases) decreasing in ages 1 -4 years (8.5 per 100,000, 21 ca ses). Ten deaths occurred in 2019, giving a case fatality rate of 7.2 percent (ESR, 8 June 2020). 316 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Strain types Strain type was determined for 122 of the 134 laboratory -confirmed cases in 2019. Group B strains were the most prevalent, causing 51 percent of the confirmed cases (Figure 13.2). The group B strain (B:4:P1.7b,4) responsible for the epidemic caused 16 percent of all meningococcal disease in 2019 (19 of the 122 typed cases). Cases of meningococcal disease caused by gro up C strains decreased since 2011 ( Figure 13.2), while group W increased from five cases in 2016 to 36 in 2019. Figure 13.2: Meningococcal disease notifications by group, 2013 -2019 Source: ESR 13.4 Vaccines 13.4.1 Introduction Internationally, meningococcal vaccination programmes were revolutionised by the development of conjugate vaccines, which allow vaccination in younger children and IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 317 induced herd immunity when used in population -wide programmes due to reduced nasopharyngeal carriage (see section 1.4.3). The monovalent (C) and quadrivalent (ACWY) conjugate vaccines are conjugated to a protein, either CRM 197 (diphtheria toxin -derived), diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid. Previously used, polysaccharide -only vaccines provided three to five years ' protection in adults, but they are generally regarded as inferior to conjugate vaccines and are no longer available or registered in New Zealan d. Those travelling to Africa, the Middle East and other areas with wide serogroup prevalence, including group A, require MenACWY vaccine for broad protection. In 2018, a multicomponent meningococcal group B recombinant vaccine (4CMenB) was registered in N ew Zealand to protect against group B disease. With the current New Zealand epidemiology, neither MenACWY nor 4CMenB give protection across all prevailing meningococcal groups and both types of vaccine are recommended. The meningococcal vaccines registere d and available are summarised in Table 13.3 below. Table 13.3: Meningococcal vaccines registered and available in New Zealand Name Vaccine type Menactra (Sanofi) Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY to tetanus toxoid Meningococcal -component recombinant (4CMenB) Funded vaccines No meningococcal vaccines are on the routine Schedule but group C conjugate and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines are recommended and funded for certain individuals (se e section 13.5). Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines are funded for certain at -risk groups. Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine MenC (NeisVac -C, Pfizer NZ Ltd) contains 10 \u00b5g of polysaccharide derived from the group C capsule, conjugated to 10 -20 \u00b5g of tetanus toxoid. Other components include aluminium hydroxide \u00b5g of each polysaccharide derived from the capsules of group A, C, W and Y N. meningitidis strains, each conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. Other components include sodium chloride and sodium phosphate. 318 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Other vaccines meningococcal -T (Nimenrix, Pfizer NZ Ltd) is registered and available in New Zealand for individuals from age 6 weeks. MenACWY -T contains 5 \u00b5g of each polysaccharide derived from the capsules of group A, C, W and Y N. meningitidis strains, conjugated to 44 \u00b5g of tetanus toxoid carrier protein. Other components and excipients include sodium (Menveo, GSK) is licensed from 2 months of age elsewhere, including Australia, Europe, UK and the US, which is conjugated to a diphtheria -toxin derived CRM 197 protein (as used in PCV13). It is not available in New Zeal and. Group B meningococcal vaccines The 4CMenB recombinant vaccine (Bexsero, GSK) is available in New Zealand from age 6 weeks (not funded). Based on bactericidal antibody titres, it is expected to provide protection against more than 75 percent of the ci rculating group B strains, including the former epidemic strain B:4:P1.7b,4 (NZ 98/254). This vaccine contains four components from the group B meningococci: three recombinant group B surface proteins associated with bacterial adhesion and survival plus de toxified outer membrane vesicles containing antigen used in the MenNZB epidemic vaccine. The UK funded 4CMenB vaccine for infants from September 2015.14 Doses are given at age 8 weeks and 16 weeks, with a booster at 12 months.15 A two -component meningococcal group B recombinant vaccine (2CM enB; Trumenba, Pfizer Ltd) is licensed from 10 years of age in the US, Europe and Australia. It is not registered in New Zealand.16 In February 2015 the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that individuals aged 10 years or older at increased risk for meningococcal disease should receive a meningococcal B vaccine (either 4CMenB or 2CMenB).17 In June 2015, this recommenda tion was extended to include all aged 16 -23 years (with a preferred age of 16 -18 years), to provide short -term protection against most circulating strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease.18 Historic MeNZB vaccine A strain -specific group B meningococ cal vaccine (MeNZB, Chiron/Novartis) containing outer membrane vesicles derived from the epidemic strain B:4:P1.7b,4 (NZ 98/254) was developed for epidemic control in New Zealand and used between 2004 and 2008. The programme ceased in 2008 because of a dec line in incidence of group B disease (see previous editions of the Handbook) . Since the immune response to MenNZB was short -lived, previous recipients who wish to be protected against meningococcal B disease will need to be fully immunised with 4CMenB. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate Clinical trial data use immunogenicity and bactericidal antibody titres as a proxy for efficacy. Effectiveness of conjugate meningococcal vaccination against laboratory - confirmed disease is difficult to assess due to the low incidence of cases, even during localised epidemics, such that data is limited around the effectiveness of the MenACWY vaccines. With the emergence of group W and Y strains, more co untries have implemented mass campaigns and routine immunisation programmes to control outbreaks with MenACWY vaccines and can assess impact through disease incidence and carriage studies. The overall effectiveness of a single dose of diphtheria conjugate quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY -D, Menactra) given at age 11 -12 years was estimated to be 69 percent up to eight years post -vaccination (from 79 percent in year one to 61 percent up to eight years post -vaccination).19 These findings cannot be extrapolated across all MenACWY vaccines due to differences in immunogenicity. Following a mass vaccination campaign in children aged 9 months to 4 years in Chile with MenACWY (MenACWY -D or MenACWY -CRM, depending on age), there was a 92.3 percent reduction in group W disease and the case -fatality rate declined from 23 percent in 2012 to 0 percent in 2016 in children aged 1 -4 years. However, there was no impact in infants aged under 12 months or adults aged 80 years or older.20 The MenACWY -D vaccine was poorly immunogenic in infants aged under 6 months,21 and it is currently registered in New Zealand for individuals aged 9 months to 55 years. The MenACWY -T vaccine (Nimenrix) is registered in New Zealand for individuals from aged 6 weeks. Clinical trials showed that the vaccine elicited bactericidal antibodies against all four groups from age 2 months with acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile.22 The conjugate quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines are available in New Zeala nd. There is no published data on effectiveness in older adults. Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccines Meningococcal C conjugate vaccines were used successfully in national immunisation and mass vaccination programmes from 1999 in the UK, resulting in almost complete elimination of group C disease.15 A targeted imm unisation campaign during an epidemic in Salvador, Brazil demonstrated MenC vaccination to be 98 percent effective against group C disease in young children.23 Data from the UK programme indicated that a booster dose in the second year of life was important for sustained protect ion following infant vaccination.24 Protective efcacy against carriage by adolescents of group C one year after the UK immunisation campaign was estimated at 69 percent .25 Countries t hat included catch -up vaccinations for older children and adolescents, including the UK and Australia, have observed the greatest impact from meningococcal immunisation campaigns through herd immunity 320 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 and a reduction in transmission across all age groups. There was a 67 percent reduction in group C disease among unvaccinated children within the target age groups and a reduction of 35 percent of cases in unvaccinated adults older than age 25 years.26 At the same time there was no evidence of capsular switching or an increase in disease caused by grou p B strains.27 With the emergence of group W and now group Y meningococci, MenC has generally been replaced by MenACWY vaccines on national programmes in infants and ad olescents. Meningococcal group B recombinant vaccine Three years after initiation of the introduction of 4CMenB to the national immunisation schedule in the UK, a 75 percent reduction in group B disease was reported in the vaccine -eligible age groups comp ared with a historical cohort.28 With 88 percent coverage but a low number of cases (25), adjusted vaccine effecti veness for all group B strains was 59.1 percent (95% CI: -31.1-87.2) following two primary doses and one booster dose, with an estimated 277 cases prevented.28 This research is ongoing. As has been observed during college outbreaks in the US,29, 30 in South Australia where 4CMenB is administered in a sc hool-based programme at age 15 -18 years, 4CMenB had no effect on disease -causing meningococci carriage suggesting that vaccination of adolescents is unlikely to generate herd immunity.31 A 4CMenB vaccination campaign used during an isolated outbreak in a region of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada outbreak demonstrated direct protection of 79 percent against outbreak strain group B disease and an overall impact of 8 6 percent in target groups with no herd effects.32 The safety and efficacy of 4CMenB in adults above 50 years of age have not been established. There is limited data on its use in patients with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromised by medication or disease, such as HIV infection or hereditary immune system defects. 13.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) -T and 4CMenB should light. Do not freeze. Reconstitution MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) must be reconstituted with the supplied diluent and used as soon as possible. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 321 13.4.4 Dosage and administration Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MenACWY) Each MenACWY dose is 0.5 mL, administered by i ntramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). Menactra (MenACWY -D) MenACWY -D (Menactra) is registered in New Zealand for individuals aged 9 months to 55 years. For c hildren aged 9 -23 months, two doses are given at least three months apart. For individuals aged 2 -55 years, one dose is given. See Table 13.5 for schedules for at -risk individuals. MenACWY -D can be concurrently administered with other vaccines in separate syringes and at separate sites,33, 34, 35, 36 except for PCV13. MenACWY -D should preferably be administered at least four weeks after PCV13. This is because, when administered concurrently, there is possible blunting of the immune response to some of the pneumococcal serotypes.37, 38 (see section 13.5.2 for recommendations in regard to hig h-risk children age under 12 (MenACWY -T) MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) is registered in New Zealand for individuals from age 6 weeks. For infants aged under 12 months, two doses are given eight weeks apart, with a boos ter from age 12 months at least six months after second dose. For adults and children from age 12 months, one dose is given. A booster dose may be indicated in some individuals. MenACWY -T can be concurrently administered with other vaccines in separate sy ringes and at separate sites; there is no data on concurrent administration of MenACWY -T and PCV13, however, interference is unlikely. conjugate vaccine (MenC) Each MenC (NeisVac is administered by intramuscular injec tion (see section 2.2.3). For infants aged under 9 months, two doses are given at least eight weeks apart, with the first dose given not earlier than age 6 weeks. One dose of MenACWY is recommended in the second year of life from age 12 months. See Table 13.5 for schedules for at -risk individuals. MenC can be administered concur rently with other scheduled vaccines, in separate syringes and at separate sites. In view of the New Zealand epidemiology, a quadrivalent (MenACWY) vaccine would be preferable, to obtain broader meningococcal protection. 322 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Meningococcal group B recombinant vaccine (4CMenB) Each 4CMenB (Bexsero) dose is 0.5 ml, administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). For infants aged 6 weeks to 11 mon ths, two doses are given with a minimum of eight weeks between doses, with a booster given from 12 months at least six months after the second dose. For children aged 12 months to under 11 years, two doses are given at least eight weeks apart. No booster dose is required. For children and adults aged 11 years to 50 years, two doses are given one month apart. No booster dose is required. (Note: the safety and efficacy in individuals aged over 50 years have not been established.) 4CMenB can be administered concurrently with other scheduled vaccines, in separate syringes and at separate sites. Note: 4CMenB elicits a robust immune response, sometimes with high fevers in some infants. Routine use of paracetamol with every dose of 4CMen B in children aged under 2 years, whether given alone or with other vaccines, is recommended to reduce the risk of high fever and injection -site pain. Some infants will still develop a fever and/or injection -site pain even though they have received paracet amol doses . Prophylaxic paracetamol is recommended to be given 30 minutes prior to and six-hourly for up to 48 hours following vaccination for children aged under 2 years. For children and infants aged from 2 months, ibuprofen may be given as an alternati ve to paracetamol. 13.5 Recommended immunisation schedule 13.5.1 Individuals at increased risk Meningococcal vaccines are not on the Schedule but are funded in special circumstances, as described in the shaded section of Table 13.4; Table 13.5 shows the recommended dosing schedules. See sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 for more information about vaccination of special groups, including recommended immunisation schedules for high -risk individuals with certain medical conditions. The meningococcal vaccines are recommended (but not funded) for other individuals at risk, as described in Table 13.4. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 323 Before travel There are areas of the world where the risk of meningococcal disease is increased. Nevertheless, the risk to travellers to the developing world has been estimated as being less than one in a million per month. Recurrent epidemic s of meningococcal disease occur in the sub -Saharan 'meningitis belt ', from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, usually during the dry season (December to June). Epidemics are occasionally identied in other parts of the world, including in Europe and the Americas. Generally, countries outside of Africa experience smaller outbreaks, but case - fatality rates can be high. The preferred vaccines (MenACWY and/or 4CMenB) for travel would be based on the epidemiology of the country. For website sources f or information about meningococcal vaccines for travellers, see the WHO website ( www.who.int/ith/en ). Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is a requirement for pilgrims to the Hajj. Before moving into communal living situations MenACWY -D is recommended and funded from age 13 -25 years inclusively for individuals who will be living in communal accommodation within the next three months, or who are in their first year of living in communal accommodation (s pecifically, boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks or prisons) as they are likely to be at higher risk of acquiring meningococcal infection. A catch -up dose of MenACWY -D is also funded for individuals who are cur rently living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks, or prisons, from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021 . Table 13.4: Meningococcal vaccine recommendations Note: Funded circumstances are in the shaded rows . See the Pharmaceutical Schedule ( www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for any changes to the funding decisions.

MenACWY -T is recommended but not funded for high -risk infants age under 9 months in place of MenC . 4CMenB is recommended but not funded for all the above high -risk groups. Other groups MenACWY and 4CMenB are recommended but not funded for all infants, young childre n, adolescents and young adults. a. Pneumococcal, Hib, influenza and varicella vaccines are also recommended for individuals pre - or post - splenectomy or with functional asplenia. See section 4.3.4 . b. See section 4.3.4 for more information. c. The period of immunosuppression due to steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy must be longer than 28 days. d. Only on e dose is funded for close contacts of meningococcal cases . Table 13.5: Recommended meningococcal vaccine schedule for high -risk individuals (funded) Note: See the Pharmaceutical Schedule ( www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for any changes to funding decisions. Age at diagnosis Vaccine (trade name) Recommended vaccine schedule Infants aged 6 weeks to under 12 months MenC (NeisVac -C) and MenACWY -D (Menactra) If aged under 9 months, give 2 doses of MenC 8 weeks apart, followed by MenACWY -Da at ages 9 and 13 months. Administer one MenACWY -D booster dose after 3 years, then 5 -yearly. (See alternative unfunded MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) option in Table 13.6.) If aged 9 -11 months, give 2 doses of MenACWY -Da at least 3 months apart, followed by a booster dose after 3 years, then 5 -yearly. Children aged 12 months to under 18 years MenACWY -D (Menactra) If aged 12 months - under 8 years at diagnosis, give 2 doses of MenACWY -Da at least 3 months apart followed by a booster dose after 3 years, then 5-yearly. If aged 8 years or older give 2 doses of MenACWY -D 8 weeks apart followed by a booster dose 5 -yearly .a Adults aged 18 years and older MenACWY -D (Menactra) Give 2 doses 8 weeks apart, then 1 dose every 5 years.a,b Individuals aged between 13 and 25 years, in certain communal living situationsc MenACWY -D (Menactra) 1 dose, no booster required a. Give MenACWY -D at least 4 weeks before or after PCV1337, 38 (see below) . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 325 b. MenACWY -D is registered for individuals aged 9 months to 55 years, but there are not expected to be any safety concerns when administered to adults older t han 55 years . c. Funded for individuals aged 13 -25 years inclusively who either: are entering within three months or who are in their first year of living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks or prisons; or t o 30 November 202 1 who are currently living in boarding school hostels, tertiary education halls of residence, military barracks or prisons. There is a possibility of blunting of some PCV serotype antibody responses when MenACWY -D (Menactra) is given concurrently with the PCV13 series because both vaccines contain diphtheria -derived proteins as conjugates. The clinical significance of this blunting, observed in a clinical trial with PCV7 ,38 is unknown and the affected serotypes (4, 6B, 18C) are currently rare in New Zealand. The benefits of achieving broad meningococcal protection as early as possible in immunocompromised infa nts outweigh the theoretical risk of modest reduction of some pneumococcal antibody levels, so MenACWY -D is recommended at 9 months (see Table 4.4, Table 4.5 and Table 13.5). Note: two doses given at least three months apart ar e recommended as a primary series; each dose should be given at least four weeks before or after PCV13 to reduce this risk of interference. 13.5.2 Recommendations for children and adolescents In the absence of a universal programme, non -high-risk children and ad olescents may be offered meningococcal vaccines, but these are not funded. Table 13.6 suggests the most appropriate ages for this, reflecting the known ages of increase d risk. The predominant meningococcal strains in New Zealand in childhood are B, W and C. With the current New Zealand epidemiology, neither MenACWY nor 4CMenB give protection across all prevailing meningococcal groups and both types of vaccine are recomme nded. For those who are likely to travel, the broadest protection is preferable because of the differing serotype patterns between countries. Table 13.6: Recommended schedule for non -funded meningococcal vac cines in children and adolescents Note: Vaccine immunity is not long -lasting. The suggested ages of vaccination are not expected to protect individuals through all of childhood but focused on protection during the ages of highest risk. This does not apply to epidemic situations.

Refer to section 13.4.4 and the vaccine data sheets for the intervals between doses. b. Prophylaxis paracetamol (or ibuprofen) is recommended for this age group, se e section 13.7.3 . c. MenACWY -D should be administered at least 4 weeks after PCV13 (if used) . d. In particular, for individuals aged 13 -25 years not eligible to funded vaccine, particularly living in crowded private homes, other hostels or student accommodation, or planning overseas travel. 13.5.3 Pregnancy and breastfeeding There are no reports of any adverse effects among pregnant women who have been vaccinated during pregnancy.37 The vaccine may be given to pregnant women if indicated.37 Meningococcal vaccine may be given to breastfeeding women. 13.5.4 (Re)vaccination Meningococcal conjugate vaccines, MenC (age under 2 years) and MenACWY -D (from age 9 months) are funded for vaccination or re-vaccination of eligib le individuals, as follows. See also section 4.3. Up to three doses plus booster doses (as appropriate) are funded for individuals: pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplantation with functional asplenia with complement deficiency (acquired or inherited) who are HIV -positive. Two doses are funded for individuals: post-haematopoietic stem cell transplantation prior to planned or following im munosuppression for longer than 28 days. 13.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 327 There are no specic contraindications for meningococcal vaccines, except for anaphylaxis to a previous dose or any component of the vaccine. 13.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 13.7.1 Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine Potential vaccines include localised pain, irritability, headache and fatigue.22, 39 Fever is reported by 2 -5 percent of adolescents who receive MenACWY -D. The safety of two doses of MenACWY -D was assessed in a phase III trial of infants: dose one was administered at age 9 months and dose two was administered at age 12 months, with or without routine childhood vaccines.38 The percent age of participants with solicited systemic reactions after MenACWY -D administration alone at age 12 months (60.6 percent ) was lower than after the vaccinati on at age 9 months (68.2 percent ), lower than the control groups at age 12 months (75.2 -84.1 percent , depending upon the control vaccine) and lower than when MenACWY -D was administered concurrently with the routine childhood vaccines (68.3 -73.2 percent ). The safety profile of MenACWY -T (Nimenrix) very similar to other meningococcal conjugate vaccines.22 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome There is no evidence of an association between meningococcal conjug ate vaccines and GBS. An early report in the US of a suspected temporal association between MenACWY -D (Menactra) and GBS was followed by a large retrospective cohort study in the US that found no evidence of an increased risk of GBS following administratio n of MenACWY -D.37, 40 If indicated, meningococca l conjugate vaccines may be administered to individuals with a history of GBS.41 13.7.2 Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine A Cochrane Review assessed the safety of MenC against group C disease.42 MenC vaccines were shown to have an excellent safety profile in infants. The events more frequently reported in infants were fever (1 -5 percent ), irritability (38 -67 percent ), crying more than e xpected (1 -13 percent ), redness at the site of vaccination (6-97 percent ), tenderness at the site of vaccination (11 -13 percent ) and swelling at the site of vaccination (6 -42 percent ). Anaphylaxis was reported at a rate of one per 500,000 doses distributed .4 328 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 13.7.3 Meningococcal B recombinant vaccine There is an increased risk of fever and medically attended fever -related events, such as febrile seizures, associated with 4CMenB in some children age under 2 years.4, 43, 44, 45, 46 These events peaked at six hours post -vaccination and generally subsided by day 3. Prophylaxic paracetamol is recommended 30 minutes prior and six-hourly for up to 48 hours following vaccination for children aged under 2 years. Ibuprofen may be given as an alternative to paracetamol. Some infants will still develop a fever and /or injection -site pain even though they have received paracetamol doses. In clinical trials, some infants and young children also experienced injection -site tenderness and irritability. Adolescents and adults may experience localised pain, nausea, myalgi a, malaise, mild fever and headache. 13.8 Public health measures Invasive meningococcal disease must be notified on suspicion to the local medical officer of health. The overall rate of secondary cases in untreated adults is around 1 per 300. Adults and children in close contact with primary cases of invasive meningococcal infection are recommended to receive antibiotic prophylaxis, preferably within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis, but prophylaxis is recommended up to 14 days after diagnosis of illness . Blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture is the main diagnostic method, but blood PCR may be useful if antibiotics are given without prior access to blood culture. It is recommended that in primary care 3 -5 mL of blood should be taken in an ethylenediaminet etraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tube (usually with a purple top) prior to administration of antibiotics unless blood culture is available. This should accompany the patient to hospital. 13.8.1 Contacts A contact is anyone who has had unprotected contact with upper respiratory tract or respiratory droplets from the case during the seven days before onset of illness to 24 hours after onset of effective treatment.47 Contacts at particular ri sk include: those sleeping at least one night in the same household, dormitory, military barrack or student hostel bunkroom (not residents of nursing or residential homes who sleep in separate rooms) as the case, or who have been in a seat adjacent to the case in a plane, bus or train for more than eight hours health care workers who have had intensive unprotected contact (not wearing a mask) with a case during intubation, resuscitation or close examination of the oropharynx IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 329 exchange of upper respiratory tr act secretions, including intimate kissing other contacts as determined by the medical officer of health on a case -by-case basis, such as children and staff attending an early childhood service. Prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for health care per sonnel unless there has been intimate contact with oral secretions (eg, performing mouth -to-mouth resuscitation or suctioning of the case before antibiotic therapy has started). 13.8.2 Chemoprophylaxis for contacts Recommended antibiotics The recommended antibiotics are rifampicin, ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin, preferably given within 24 hours of initial diagnosis, but prophylaxis is recommended up to 14 days after diagnosis of illness. Rifampicin The recommended dose of rifampicin is 10 mg/kg (maximum dose 600 mg) every 12 hours for two days. For infants aged under 4 weeks, the recommended dose is 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for two days. Rifampicin should be avoided for pregnant or lactating women. Ceftriaxone A single dose of intramuscular ceft riaxone (125 mg for children aged under 12 years and 250 mg for older children and adults) has been found to have an efcacy equal to that of rifampicin in eradicating the meningococcal group A carrier state. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice in a pregnant woman because rifampicin is not recommended later in pregnancy. Ceftriaxone may be reconstituted with lignocaine (according to the manufacturer 's instructions) to reduce the pain of injection. A New Zealand study demonstrated that ceftriaxone and rifampic in were equivalent in terms of eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis group B.48 Do not use in infants under aged under 4 weeks. Ciprofloxacin Ciprofloxacin given as a single oral dose of 500 mg or 750 mg is also effective at eradicating carriage. This is the preferred prophylaxis for women on the oral contraceptive pill and for prophylaxis of large groups.47 Ciprofloxacin is not generally recommended for pregnant and lactating women or for children aged under 18 years.49 Consult the manufacturer 's data sheet for appropriate use and dosage of ciprof loxacin in children. 330 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Use of meningococcal vaccines for close contacts Close contacts of cases of group A, C, W or Y meningococcal disease may be offered the appropriate meningococcal conjugate vaccine (see section 13.5). In a multi -occupancy residential meningococcal B outbreak an emergency supply of 4CMenB is available for use. See below for the use of the vaccines for the control of outbreaks, as initiated by the local public health service. 13.8.3 Outbreak control When there is an outbreak of meningococcal disease of a specific vaccine group, an immunisation programme may be recommended and funded for a dened population. The local medical officer of he alth will determine the necessary action in discussion with the Ministry of Health. For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Neisseria meningitidis invasive disease ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Manual (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual -2012 ). 13.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheets The MenACWY -D data sheet states that the vaccine is indicated for use in individuals aged 9 months to 55 years . The Ministry of Health recommends that this vaccine may be used in adults aged over 55 years.41 The data sheet states that MenACWY -D should be given as a single dose for individuals aged 2 years and older. The Ministry of Health recommends that two doses are given to individuals at high risk of meningococcal disease (see Table 13.5 and section 4.3), with booster doses every five years. If the first MenACWY -D dose was given b efore age 7 years, give a booster after three years then five-yearly.39 A history of GBS is listed as a precaution in the MenACWY -D data sheet. However, there is no evidence of an association between meningococcal conjugate vaccines and GBS (see section 13.7.2 ). The Ministry of Health advises that, if indicated, MenACWY -D may be administered to individuals with a history of GBS.41 The MenC data sheet states that the first dose of vaccine is not be given earlier than age 8 weeks. However, the Ministry of Health recommen ds that MenC may be given from age 6 weeks to infants at high risk of meningococcal disease (see Table 13.4 and Table 13.5). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 331 The 4CMenB data sheet states that the vaccine is indicated from age 2 months or older. However, the Ministry of Health recommends that 4CMenB can be given from age 6 weeks to infants at hig h risk of meningococcal disease (see Table 13.5). References 1.

Incubation period About 16 to 18 days, ranging from 12 to 25 days. Period of communicability For contact tracing purposes, the recommended period of communicability is from 2 days before to 5 days after the onset of parotitis. The virus is also transmitted by asymptomatic infections. Incidence and burden of disease Outbreaks are continuing to occur in New Zealand. Funded vaccine MMR (Priorix) is a live attenuated vaccine. Dose, presentation, route 0.5 mL per dose after reconstitution. Pre-filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Funded vaccine indications and schedule Children at ages 12 months and 15 months. Adults who are susceptible to one or more of measles, mumps and rubella. For (re)vaccination following immunosuppression (if the individual is immunocompetent enough to safely receive the vaccine). Recommended All adults born since January 1969 sh ould be up to date with two doses of MMR or have evidence of immunity to all three vaccine components . It is particularly important for health care workers, individuals who work with children, armed forces personnel, staff of correctional facilities, long -term care facilities and immigration/refugee centres and laboratory staff. All vaccine -eligible travellers, particularly to high -risk countries Vaccine effectiveness After one dose, MMR is 64 -66 percent effective against laboratory - confirmed mumps and 83 -88 percent after two vaccine doses. Duration of protection At least 10 years; protection is best achieved via herd immunity from high immunisation coverage. Contraindication and precautions MMR is contraindicated for anaphylaxis to neomycin, immunocompro mise and in pregnancy. See section 12.6 for cautions around receipt of blood products and other live vaccines, and other precautions. MMR may temporarily suppress tuberculin skin test reactivity. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 335 Potential responses to vaccine MMR is generally well tolerated. There can be mild salivary gland swelling after 10 -14 days. If there is fever and rash 6 -12 days after vaccination this is due to measles and rubella components. Alert parents of possible febrile seizure risk, particularly for those with a history of seizure. Public health measures Notify the local medical officer of health immediately on suspicion of wild -type measles. See section 14.8.3 . Exclude cases for 5 days from onset of glandular swelling. Exclude susceptible contacts from 12 days after the first exposure to 25 days after last exposure to the infectious case. 14.1 Virology Mumps is a paramyxovirus, genus Rubulavirus , with a single -stranded RNA is rapidly inactivated by heat, formalin, ether, chloroform and light. 14.2 Clinical features Mumps is transmitted by airborne droplets or direct contact with infected respirato ry tract secretio ns or urine. Humans are the only known host of the virus. People with mumps are most infectious from two days before to five days after the onset of parotitis;1 therefore, this is the recommended period of communicability for contact tracing purposes.1 However, mumps virus has been isolated in saliva from seven days before to nine days after the onset of parotitis. Asymptomatic cases also can be infectious.1 Classic mumps, an acute viral illness, is characterised by fever, headache, and swelling and tenderness of one or more parotid (salivary) glands. Mumps starts as an upper respiratory tract infection that disseminates via plasma viremia to glandular tissue, kidneys and central nervous system. Some patients may experience involvement of other organs (eg, orchitis or meningitis) without salivary gland involvement. At lea st 30 percent of mumps infections in children are asymptomatic.2 The complications of symptomatic mump s include clinically evident aseptic meningitis in 5-10 percent (almost always without sequelae), orchitis (usually unilateral) in up to one-third of post -pubertal males, and oophoritis and mastitis in 5 -30 percent of post - pubertal females. Sterility is ex ceedingly rare in males and unconfirmed in females.2 Profound sudden onset unilateral nerve deafness oc curs in IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Encephalitis has been reported to occur at a frequency of between 1 in 400 and 1 in 6,000, the latter being a more realistic estimate. The case fatality rate for mumps encephalitis is 1.4 percent , while the overall mumps case fatality rate is r eported as 1.8 per 10,000 cases. Mumps in the rst trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion, but there is no evidence that it causes fetal abnormalities. 14.3 Epidemiology 14.3.1 Global burden of disease Prior to the introduction of immunisation, approximately 85 percent of adults had evidence of past mumps infection. Most infections in those aged under 2 years are subclinical, while those affected in adulthood are more likely to experience severe disease. The peak inc idence was in late winter and spring. More recently, there have been numerous reports of increasing numbers of mumps cases in the US, the UK and elsewhere, thought to be due to a waning of vaccine - induced immunity.4 Many cases are reported in 18 -30-year olds.5 Outbreaks appear to occur mainly in those in crowded situations, such as university students and other close -knit communities, and have been associated with international travel.6 14.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Mumps vaccine (as MMR) was introduced to the Schedule in 1990 for children aged 12 to 15 months, with a second dose introduced in 1992 for children aged 11 years. A two-dose schedule at ages 15 months and 4 years was introduced in 2001 (see Appendix 1 for more information). Prior to 2017, the last mumps epidemic had occurred in 1994. The current two -dose schedule was introduced in 2020 at age 12 months and 15 months. People aged 12 -29 years are at the greatest risk of catching mumps, as they are the group least likely to have been fully immunised as children. Those born in Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu as well as many mainland nations in Asia may not have been offered mumps immunisation as children . From 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019, 1,773 cases of mumps were notified (ESR, 8 June 2020). During 2019, the notification rate was 5.4 per 100,000 (264 cases) compared with 9.0 per 100,000 (435 cases) in 2018. In 2019, the highest notification rates were seen in young adults aged 15 to 29 years. Cases were predominantly in the Auckland region, with the highest notification rates in the Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (MELAA) ethnic group (19.9 per 100,000) and Pacific people (15.2 cases per 100 ,000; ESR, 8 June 2020). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 337 Notified cases of mumps, 1997 -2019 Source: ESR Outbreaks continue to occur throughout New Zealand. For further details refer to the ESR surveillance reports for notifiable diseases (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveilla nce.php ). 14.4 Vaccines 14.4.1 Available vaccines Mumps vaccine is one of the components of the live attenuated MMR, considered in section 12.4 (and MMRV mentioned in section 22.4). There are no single antigen mumps vaccines available. Funded vaccine MMR vaccine funded as part of the Schedule is Priorix (GSK), which contains attenuated Jeryl section 12.4.1 for more information. 338 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Other vaccines M-M-R II (MSD) was the funded vaccine prior to the 1 July 2017 Schedule change (see section 12.4.1 ). 14.4.2 Efcacy and e ffectiveness A 2012 Cochrane review of the safety and effectiveness of MMR estimated that a single dose of MMR was 69 -81 percent effective in preventing clinical mumps. Effectiveness of MMR in preventing laboratory -confirmed mumps cases in children and ado lescents was estimated to be between 64 and 66 percent for one dose and between 83 and 88 percent for two vaccine doses.7 A two -dose vaccination schedule and high immunisation coverage has been very successful in controlling disease. However, outbreaks can still occur in highly immunised populations, because two doses of vaccine are not 100 percent effective. Community coverage needs to be 85 -90 percent by 2 years of age to prevent outbreaks from asymptomatic cases.2 Declining vaccine -induced mumps immunity may also contribute to outbreaks.4 Data from Finland shows that 20 years after the second MMR dose, immunity to mumps declined with just under 75 percent being seropositive.8 The antibody avidity also decreased over time, by 24 percent for mumps.9 Two doses of MMR are required to ensure a high rate of seroprotection against mumps and induce antibody responses that persist for at least 10 years post - vaccination.10, 11 However, waning in immunity has been observed in young adults and a third dose of MMR has been used safely and effectively during mumps outbreaks in highly immunised populations.12, 13 Although the mumps vaccine is not quite as effective as measles and rubella vaccines, cases that have been vaccinated are significantly less likely to experience complications from disease such as orchitis, meningitis and hospitalisation.14 14.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) C. Do not freeze. MMR must be reconstituted only with the diluents supplied by the manufacturer. Use MMR as soon as possible after reconstitution. If storage is necessary, reconstituted vaccine can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C for up to eight hours. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 339 14.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of MMR is all of the reconstituted vaccine (approximately 0.5 mL) administered by intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection if indicated (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines MMR can be given concurrently with other vaccines, by using separate syringes and giving the injections at different sites. If not given concurrently, live vaccines should b e given at least four weeks apart. (See also section 2.2.7 for information about multiple injections at the same visit.) Interchangeability The two brands of MMR available in New Zealand (Priorix and M -M-R II) may be used interchangeably for completi on of a course.15 14.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Table 14.1: Recommended MMR vaccination schedule Schedule Usual childhood schedulea 2 doses: at ages 12 months and 15 months Catch -upb for children, adolescents and adults 2 doses: at least 4 weeks apart a. If MMR is given to children aged 6 -12 months for outbreak control, 2 further MMR doses are still required at ages 12 months (at least 4 weeks after previous dose) and 15 months. b. MMR is funded for those who are susceptible to 1 or more of the 3 diseases. 14.5.1 Usual childhood schedule Two doses of mumps -containing vaccine as MMR are recommended at age 12 months and 15 month s (Table 14.1). The second dose can be given as soon as four weeks after the rst dose. Children who receive MMR when aged under 12 months during an outbreak require two further doses administered after a ge 12 months. No opportunity should be missed to achieve immunity. 340 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 14.5.2 Catch -up MMR is recommended and funded for children, adolescents and adults (born since 1 January 1969) who are known to be susceptible to one or more of the three diseases (two doses, fou r weeks apart). See sections 12.5.2 and 19.5.2 . 14.5.3 Immunocompromise Contact s In general, MMR is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3). These individuals can be partially protected from exposure to infection by ensuring that all contacts are fully immunised (funded), including hospital staff and family members. There is no r isk of transmission of MMR vaccine viruses from a vaccine recipient to the immunocompromised individual (see section 12.7.2 ). See also in section 4.3.1. (Re)vaccination following immunosuppression MMR is funded for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression. However, it is important to be sure that the individual is immunocompetent enough to safely receive the vaccine. HIV infection Discuss vaccination of individuals with HIV infection with their specialist (see 'HIV infection ' in section 4.3.3). MMR is recommended for all HIV -positive children, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, if their CD4+ lymphocyte percentage is 15 percent or greater. Asymptomatic children who are not severely immunocompromised are recommended to receive MMR from age 12 months to provide early protection against the three diseases. Susceptible HIV -positive children and adults aged 14 years and older may receive MMR if their CD4+ lymphocyte count is at least 200 cells/mm3. Administration of MMR w ith CD4+ counts below these recommended levels has been associated with vaccine -related pneumonitis (from the is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after MMR vaccination.16, 17 (see section 14.6.1 ). After delivery If MMR and Rhesus anti -D IG are required after delivery, both the vaccine and anti -D IG may be given at the same time, in separate sites with separate syringes. The vaccine may be given at any time after the delivery. Anti -D IG does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine, but whole blood transfusion does inhibit the response in up to 50 percent of vaccines recipients (see section A6.4.1 ). MMR can safely be given to breastfeeding women. 14.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general vaccine contraindications. Contraindications See section 12.6.1 for specific MMR contraindications. Anaphylaxis to a previous dose of MMR or any of the vaccine components (including neomycin) is a contraindication to a further dose of MMR. MMR should not be given to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after immunisation.16, 17 However, inadvertent immunisation with a rubella -containing vaccine in early pregnancy is no longer considered an indication for termination of pregnancy. There have been no cases of teratogenic damage from vaccine virus despite intensive surveillance in the US, the UK and Germany.18 14.6.2 Precautions Egg allergy, including anaph ylaxis, is not a contraindication to MMR. See section 12.6.3 for more information, and section 12.6.2 for further precautions. 342 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 14.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See sections 12.7 and 19.7. 14.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of mumps be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. 14.8.1 Diagnosis All suspected mumps cases should have diagnostic testing (eg, by buccal swab detection of wild -type mumps virus by PCR or culture) as there are other causes of parotitis other than the mumps virus. See the latest version of the 'Mumps ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual for the specimens required for laboratory confirmation of mumps, or discuss these with the local laboratory (available at www .health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual -2012 ). 14.8.2 Susceptible contacts A susceptible contact is anyone born after 1981 who has not had mumps infection or has not been fully vaccinated for their age. All susceptible contacts should be offered MMR vaccinations. (All vaccinations given should be recorded on the NIR.) There is no increased risk of adverse events after immunisation during the incubation period of mumps or if the recipient is already immune. Immunoglobulin is ineffective af ter exposure to mumps. 14.8.3 Exclusion and post -exposure prophylaxis Cases Exclude cases from tertiary education, school, sports, early childhood services or health care or other workplaces and from close contact with other susceptible people for five days from onset of parotitis.1 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 343 Susce ptible contacts Discuss exclusion of susceptible contacts with the local medical officer of health. Previously immunised (pre -exposure) contacts need not be excluded. Generally, unimmunised contacts who have no previous history of mumps infection should be advised not to attend early childhood services or school because of: the risk of catching the disease themselves the risk of passing on the disease, when asymptomatic or in the prodromal phase, to other susceptible children. Health care settings or working or living with immunocompromised people Advise exclusion of susceptible contacts in health care settings and for those working or living with immunocompromised people from 12 days after the first exposure to 25 days after last exposure to the infec tious case.1 Documented full immunisation with two MMR doses should be required in these situations.1 Other settings Consider advising exclusion of susceptible contacts with no MMR doses from tertiary education, school, early childhood services or workplaces from 12 days after the first exposure to 25 days aft er last exposure to the infectious case, if there is a high risk of mumps transmission.1 Exclusion is more important in secondary and tertiary education settings, as these settings are more conducive to outbreaks.1 All excluded contacts, in settings other than health care or in contact with immunocompromised p eople, can be readmitted immediately after they have received the first MMR dose.1 Those who have a history of one dose of MMR vaccination should be offered their second vaccin e dose and be allowed to remain in tertiary education, school, early childhood services or workplaces (except for health care workers or those working or living with immunocompromised people).1 For more details on control measures, refer to the latest version of the 'Mumps ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Active immunisation with MMR is not considered effective against incubating infection, but MMR should be offered to susceptible contacts for protection against future exposure. 344 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 14.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet See section 12.9 for variations from the MMR (Priorix) data sheet.

Period of communicability For control purposes, in untreated cases the communicable stage lasts from the catarrhal stage to 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal cough. When treated communicability lasts approximately 2 -5 days from the first dose. Inciden ce and burden of disease Widespread outbreaks occur every 3 -5 years. Infants aged under 12 months are at highest risk from pertussis, particularly those who have received fewer than two doses of vaccine and if the mother did not receive vaccine in pregnanc y. dose. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib: pre-filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must to injection. DTaP -IPV, Tdap: pre -filled syringe. Intramuscular injection. Funded vaccine indications and schedule During each pregnancy (recommended from 16 weeks ' gestation) Tdap 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib 4 years DTaP -IPV 11 years Tdap 45 years (catch -up, if individual has not received 4 previous tetanus doses) Tdap 65 years Tdap Parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to neonatal intensive or special care baby units for more than 3 days and whose mothers had not received Tdap at least 14 days prior to birth Tdap For vaccination of previously unimmunised or partially im DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, eligible patients IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 347 Vaccine effectiveness Vaccination in pregnancy is over 90 percent effective in preventing pertussis in infants up to age 3 months. A 3-dose primary course in infants has 84 percent efcacy against hospitalisation for pertussis. Contraindications Contraindicated where anaphylaxis to vaccine or vaccine components is proven. Potential responses to vaccine Extensive limb swelling occurs more commonly after increasing number of doses of DTaP. Affecting less than in 2 percent of children, this is typically painless and resolves spontaneously. 15.1 Bacteriology Pertussis (whooping cough) is a bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis , an exotoxin -producing gram -negative bacillus. The bacillus is fastidious (requires special techniques to grow in culture) and will often have decreased in numb ers by the time the typical cough develops, making laboratory conrmation by culture difficult. The availability of sensitive and specific PCR and serological assays has improved laboratory confirmation of suspected B. pertussis infection (see section 15.8). 15.2 Clinical features Pertussis is highly transmissible. It is one of the most infectious vaccine -preventable diseases in humans. The rate of transmission is several -fold greater than most respiratory pathogens, including influenza, such that in a non -immune population, approxi mately 5 -17 secondary pertussis cases are expected from one case (see section 1.2.1).1 Transmission occurs by aerosolised droplets, and the incubation period is 7-10 days (range 5 -21 days). There are three stages of typical pertussis infection: 1. Catarrhal stage - rhinorrhoea and irritating mild cough (typically lasting 7 -10 days). 2. Paroxysmal stage - paroxysms (bursts) of coughing; in children, these may end in vomiting, cyanosis or apnoea and inspiratory gasp or whoop (1 -6 weeks). Usually afebrile. 3. Convalescent stage - less persistent cough, gradual recovery (up to 10 weeks). The communicable period lasts from the onset of symptoms to three weeks after the start of the paroxysmal stage. 348 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Clinical presentation varies with age, immunisation status and previous infection. Pertussis must be considered in infants presenting with apnoea, since apnoea and/or cyanosis may precede paroxysmal cough.2 In school -aged children, inspiratory whoop, post-tussive vomiting and the absence of wheezing and fever distinguish pertussis from other causes of coughing illnesses.3, 4 Almost all pertussis infections in adolescents and adults occur in the context of previous infection and/or immunisation. Persistent cough for more than 14 days is the cardinal feature in adults.4, 5, 6 Coughing is often paroxysmal and worsens at night, with the patient waking with a choking sensation, but post -tussive vomiting and whoo p are infrequent. Studies performed in several countries during both epidemic and non -epidemic periods have shown that between 12 and 37 percent of school -aged children, adolescents and adults with persistent cough (lasting 14 days or more) have evidence of recent B. pertussis infection.3, 5, 7, 8, 9 A primary care -based study in New Zealand performed during the early phase of the 2011 -2013 epidemic showed recent B. pertussis infection in 17 percent of childre n aged 5 -16 years and 7 percent of adults aged 17 -49 years presenting to primary care with a persistent cough of two or more weeks ' duration.10 The disease is most often severe in infants in the first few months of life. One in six infants with pertussis sufficiently severe to require intensive care admission will eithe r die or be left with brain or lung damage.11 The most common complications of pertussis are secondary infections, such as otitis media and pneumonia, and the physical sequelae of paroxysmal coughing, (eg, petechiae and other pneumothorax; hernia; and urinary incontinence). At the peak of the paroxysmal phase, vomiting can lead to weight loss especially in infants and young children. 15.3 Epidemiology The epidemiology of B. pertussis infection and pertussis disease differ. Infection occurs across the age spectrum, and repeated infection without disease is common.12 The endemic circulation of B. pertussis in older children and adults provides a reservoir for spread of the infection and the developme nt of severe disease in incompletely vaccinated infants. The high prevalence of subclinical infections in household contacts of pertussis cases indicates a significant role in disease transmission to young infants.13, 14 As observed in Australia, seasonal peaks in incidence in children aged less than 5 years occurred 1 -2 months later than for the general population, supporting the theory that older household members are sources of infection to younger children.15 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 349 15.3.1 Global burden of disease Pertussis mortality and morbidity rates continue to be highest in the rst year of life.13 In the US during the 1940s pertussis resulted in more infant deaths than measles, diphtheria, poliomyelitis an d scarlet fever combined.16 Beyond age 3 years mortality rates have always be en relatively low. In immunised populations virtually all deaths occur in the first two months of life, and deaths in toddlers and preschool -aged children have largely disappeared. Among infants, younger age, lack of immunisation, low socioeconomic status, premature gestation, low birthweight and female gender are associated with an increased risk of fatal pertussis.17 Pertussis mortality and morbidity is under -reported.18, 19 It is estimated that there are three times more deaths due to pertussis than are reported in high -income countries.18, 20, 21 The burden of pertussis in older adults is underestimated, parti cularly for those with chronic respiratory conditions, and increases with age.22, 23 Infants continue to die from pertussis despite advances in intensive care.11, 24, 25, 26 Following the introduction of mass immunisation, countries with consistently high immunisation coverage rates have achieved consistently low pertussis incidence rates.27 The most pronounced decrease in incidence was seen in those aged under 10 years. Although primarily associated with low immunisation coverage, in some instances higher pertussis incidence rates are due to lower or waning vaccine effica cy or less -than-optimal immunisation schedules.28, 29, 30 The burden of severe disease, particularly since the introduction of acellular vaccines, is highest in infants and unvaccinated young children.31 However, less severe pertussis cases are also seen in vaccinated children who are further away from the last DTaP and, in some countries, adolescents.32, 33, 34 Infants too young to have received more than one dose of pertussis vaccine (age 3 months or less) have the highest rate of notification, hospitalisation and death.35, 36 Epidemic peaks of pertussis occur every 2 -5 years without the consistent seasonal pattern that is typical of most respiratory infections, although evidence from Australia suggests increased incide nce (by 15 percent compared with annual average) during spring to summer months.15 Epidemics are frequently sustained over 18 months or more, during which there are dramatic increases in hospital admission rates. Lack of change in the pertussis epidemic cycle with mass immunisation suggests minimal impact on the circulation of B. pertussis in the population, unlike other epidemic vaccine -preventable diseases, such as measles.12, 19, 37 15.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Pertussis mortality in New Zealand On average, zero to one deaths are associated with pertussis each year in New Zealand. During the 2011 -2013 pertussis epidemic there were three deaths in children: two in infants aged under 6 weeks and one in an unimmunised pre -schooler.38 No deaths from pertussis (as recorded in EpiSurv) occurred during the latest epidemic from October 2017 to May 2019.38, 39 350 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Pertussis morbidity in New Zealand Pertussis morbidity in New Zealand has usually been described using hospital discharge data. National passive surveillance data has been available since 1996, when pertussis became a notiable disease. Outbreaks continue to occur throughout New Zealand. For further details refer to the ESR surveillance reports for n otifiable diseases (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). Pertussis morbidity in New Zealand as described by notification data Four epidemics have occurred since pertussis became a notifiable disease, with an epidemic peak annual number of notified cases of 4,140 in 2000, 3,485 in 2004, 5,897 in 2012 and 2956 in 2018 (see Figure 15.1). The most recent outbreak commenced in October 2017; by the end of May 2019, there were 4 ,697 cases notified (2 ,939 laboratory -confirmed).39 During 2019, 1206 cases were notified, an overall notif ication rate of 24.5 cases per 100,000 population. Of these cases, 88 (7.3 percent , incidence 148 cases per 100,000) were aged under 1 year and half of these were hospitalised. The youngest infants were at highest risk of hospitalisation with 85 percent of cases age under 2 months, 80 percent age under 3 months and 66 percent aged under 6 months hospitalised (ESR, 8 June 2020). The next highest incidence rate occurred in children aged 1 -4 years (68 per 100,000). Pacific and Mori infants had the highest not ification rates (300 and 177 per 100,000 respectively), and in children aged 1 -4 years, MELAA ethnic group had the highest notification rate (175 per 100,000) followed by European/Other (77 per 100,000). Figure 15.1: Pertussis notifications and hospitalisations, 1997 -2019 Note: Includes confirmed, probable and suspect cases, and notifications still under investigation. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 351 Since pertussis became notifiable, the annual proportion of notified cases aged 30 years or older has increased from 23 percent in 1997 to 48 percent in 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020).38 However, the highest proportion of hospitalised cases continues to be in infants. From 2010 to 2019 there were 1,544 notified cases in infants with 769 (53 percent ) recorded as hospitalised ( Figure 15.2). Figure 15.2: Age distribution of notified and hospitalised pertussis cases, 2019 Source: ESR Pertussis morbidity in New Zealand, as described by hospital discharge data Infants aged under 1 year with pertussis are more likely (nearly 80 percent ) to be admitted to hospital than older children and account for almost all the pertussis cases admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit.40 Hospitalisation rates for pertussis, as measured by ICD discharge diagnostic codes, provide a measure of severe pertussis disease. The discharge rate in the 2000s was lower than it was in the 1990s (2000s versus 1990s, relative risk 0.8 [95% CI: 0.7 -0.8]). Despite this decrease, the infant hospitalisation rate for pertussis in New Zealand in the 2000s (at nearly 200 per 100,000) remained three times higher than contemporary rates in Australia (2001 infant rate: 56 per 100,000) and the US (2003 infant rate: 65 per 100,000).41, 42, 43 Pertussis hospital admission rates vary with ethnicity and household depriv ation. From 2000 -2014 the infant (under 1 year old) hospitalisation rates for pertussis fluctuated but were consistently higher for Pacific and Mori than European/Other prioritised ethnicities. Between 2010 and 2014, the hospitalisation rate was over 2.5 times higher for Pacific (4.4 per 1 ,000) and over 2 times higher for Mori (3.6 per 1 ,000) than it was for European/Other ethnicities (1.7 per 1 ,000).44 352 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 From 2010 to 2014 an infant living in a household in the most deprived quintile wa s at a five -fold increased risk of being hospitalised with pertussis compared with an infant in the least deprived quintile (4.0 versus 0.8 per 1,000 ).44 15.4 Vaccines Whole -cell pertussis vaccine for routine use was introduced in 1960 and was replaced with acellular pertussis vaccine in 2000. The current schedule of three acellular pertussis -containing vaccines in the first year of life plus booster doses at ages 4 and 11 years has been in effect since 2006. See Appendix 1 for more information about the history of pertussis -containing vaccines in New Zealand. 15.4.1 Available vaccines Funded pertussis vaccines The acellular pertussis -containing vaccines funded as part of the Schedule DTaP Hib (Infanrix -hexa, GSK): vaccine Tdap (Boostrix, GSK): a smaller adult dose of diphtheria and pertussis vaccine, together with tetanus vaccine. See section 6.4.1 for more detai ls. Other vaccines Other acellular pertussis -containing vaccines registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) in New Zealand Immunogenicity A review of published data on DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib found it to be highly immunogenic in infants aged under 2 years for primary and booster vaccination.45 In clinical studies there was a strong immune response against the vaccine antigens, which persisted for up to approximately six years after vaccination. A review of published clinical trial and post-marketing surveillance data supported the immunogenicity of DTaP -IPV- HepB/Hib across a range of schedules and when administered concurrently with other vaccines.46 Efficacy and effe ctiveness Vaccination in pregnancy Maternal vaccination, given more than seven days before delivery, was estimated to be 91 percent (95% CI: 88 -94) effective against laboratory -confirmed pertussis in infants younger than 3 months of age47 Protection of infants is achieved both by passi ve antibody transfer and reduced exposure to maternal disease.48 Tdap given in pregnancy was shown to be 85 percent more effective than post -partum vaccination in preventing pertussis in infants younger than 8 we eks of age.49 Timing is important because protection is not as good if the mother is vaccinated less than two weeks prior to birth.50 Vaccinating from 16 weeks ' gestation allows time for passive transfer and accumulation of antibody in the fetus, such that by 40 weeks ' gestation, infant antibody levels at birth are higher than those in the m other.51 Giving maternal vaccination during the second trimester rather than later provides more preterm infants with pertussis protection.52, 53 See section 15.5.2 for information about maternal pertussis vaccine safety. Direct protection The acellular pertussis vaccines approved for use in New Zealand have been shown to provide around 81 -85 percent efcacy (95% CI: 51 -100) against confirmed pertussis after three infant doses, with follow -up studies suggesting sustained efcacy to age 6 years.13, 54, 55 In a Swiss study, effectiveness against pertussis hospitalisation increased with each consecutive primary dose in infants from age 2.5 months to 2 years from 42.1 percent (95% CI: 11.3 -62.6) after the first dose, 83.9 percent (70.2 -92.1) after the second then 98.2 percent (96.1 -99.3) to 100 percent (97.9 -100) after the third and fourth doses.56 While effective, observational data from Australia found that acellular pertussis vaccines may be less effective than the best -performing whole -cell vaccines in preventing whooping cough.57, 58 However, the quality of the whole cell vaccine varied between countries and a Canadian study found it to be l ess effective than the acellular vaccine.59 354 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Age-appropriate pertussis vaccination in the US was shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and complications of the disease, including 60 percent reduction in the odds of severe disease (seizure, encephalopathy, pneumonia and/or hospitalisation) in children aged 7 months to 6 years, and 30 percent reduction in post -tussive vomiting in those aged 19 months to 64 years.60 Duration of protection Protection against pertuss is begins to wane within several years of completion of a three -dose primary and two -dose booster immunisation series. The US has a pertussis immunisation schedule that includes three doses of acellular vaccine during infancy and booster doses at 15 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years.61 The risk of pertussis increases in the six years after receipt of the fifth dose of this series, indicating a waning in vaccine -induced i mmunity over this time interval. A decline in effectiveness was seen in children more distant from the last DTaP dose, by 27 percent per year on average.62 Waning effectiveness is more rapid following the adolescent booster at around 35 percent per year.63 In children, vaccine was 80 percent (95% CI: 71 -86) effective against pertussis from two weeks to a year following vaccination, 84 percent (77-89) after 1-3 years, declining to 62 percent (42-75) after 4-7 years and to 41 percent (0-66) at eight or more years after vaccination.64 A meta - analysis estimated that only 10 percent of those vaccinated with five doses of DTaP would be immune to pertussis 8.5 years after their last DTaP dose.65 Antibodies to pertussis toxoid, filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin have been shown to persist five years after receipt of Tdap (Boostrix) in a study of Australian adults aged 18 years and older.66 However, the duration of protection is unknown. 15.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) C. Do not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib should be stored in the dark. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the supplied container of the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the vial containing the Hib -PRP-T pellet. After adding the vaccine to the pellet, the mixture should be shaken until the pellet is completely dissolved. Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kept for up to eight hours at 21\u00b0C. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 355 15.4.4 Dosage and of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and Tdap is 0.5 mL, administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and Tdap can be administered simultaneously (at separate sites) with other vaccines or IGs. 15.5 Reco mmended immunisation schedule Table 15.1: Immunisation schedule for pertussis -containing vaccines (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment Pregnant women: recommended from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester (funded when given any time in second or third trimester) Tdap Booster for mother Passive immunity for infant 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 4 years DTaP -IPV Booster 11 years Tdap Booster 45 years (individuals who have not received 4 tetanus vaccinations in their lifetime) Tdap Booster 65 years Tdap Booster 15.5.1 Children A primary course of pertussis vaccine is given as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, followed by a dose of DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV) at age 4 years ( Table 15.1). A further booster is given at age 11 years (school year 7) as Tdap (Boostrix). It is important to administer all vaccinations on time. Delays in receipt of infant immunisations significantl y increase the risk of infants being hospitalised for severe pertussis.67 356 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 If a course of immunisation is late or interrupted for any reason, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses (see Appendix 2 ). The minimum interval between doses is four weeks. A booster dose should be given no earlier than six months after the primary series. Catch -up immunisa tion See Appendix 2 for detailed catch -up immunisation information. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib or DTaP -IPV may be used for primary immunisation and boosting of children aged under 10 years. Tdap may be used for primary immunisation and boosting of children aged 7 to under 18 years. Tdap also may be given: as a single dose for vaccination of patients aged 65 years old as single dose for vaccination of patients aged 45 years o ld who have not had 4 previous tetanus doses for vaccination of previously unimmunised or partially immunised patients for vaccination prior to planned or revaccination following immunosuppression (see section 15.5.3 ) for boosting of patients with tetanus -prone wounds (see section 20.5.5 ). 15.5.2 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap in every pregnancy so that antibodies can pass to the fetus to provide protection from birth (funded when given any time in second or third trimester ). It is recommended to be given from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester to protect both the mother and her infant from pertussis .47, 51 Post-partum maternal vaccinati on may reduce the risk of a mother infecting her baby but does not have the added benefit of providing the baby with passive antibodies (see section 15.4.2 for deta ils of effectiveness) . Maternal Tdap vaccination has been shown to prevent pertussis disease or reduce severity of the disease and risk of pertussis -related death in very young infants.68 There is no evidence that Tdap vaccination affects pregnancy outcomes68, 69, 70 or causes harm to the fetus or neonate.68, 71 Tdap vaccines can be given to breastfeeding women, if not given during pregnancy.72 15.5.3 (Re)vaccination Pertussis -containing vaccines are funded for vaccination or re -vaccination of eligible patients who have become immunocompromised, as follows. See also sections 4.2 and 4.3. IMMUNISATION doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for (re)vaccination of patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for children requiring solid organ transplantation. Tdap (Boostrix) An additional four doses (as appropriate) of Tdap (Boostrix) are funded for patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. A single dose of Tdap is funded for parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or special care baby unit for more than three days and whose mothers had not received Tdap at least 14 days prior to baby 's birth. 15.5.4 Recomm ended but not funded Tdap is recommended but not funded, unless given as prophylaxis for a tetanus -prone wound, for: lead maternity carers and other health care personnel who work in neonatal units and other clinical settings (such as GPs and practice nurs es), and students of these professions where they are in contact with infants (with a booster dose at least at 10-year intervals). Infants with respiratory, cardiac, neurological or other co -morbid conditions are particularly at risk from pertussis. househ old contacts of newborns, including adult household and other close contacts (contacts aged under 18 years who are unimmunised or incompletely immunised for their age can receive funded pertussis vaccine; see Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules) regardless of maternal vaccination history, all caregivers of infants born at less than 32 weeks ' gestation are recommended to receive a single dose of Tdap (see section 4.2.2) 358 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 early childhood workers and students (with a booster dose at 10 -year intervals), although the priority is to ensure all children attending childcare have received age - appropriate vaccination adults with a medical condition, not eligible for funded vaccine, who are at increased risk of severe consequences of pertussis (eg, those with chroni c respiratory disease). 15.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 15.6.1 Contraindications The only contraindication is an immediate severe anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine, or any component of the vaccine, f ollowing a previous dose. 15.6.2 Precautions A history of well -controlled seizures in the vaccine recipient or a family history of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or other neurologic disorder is not a contraindication to vaccination against pertussis.50 Vaccination for children with an unstable neurological disorder (eg, poorly controlled epilepsy or deteriorating neurological state) has previously been considered a precaution, but as these children may be high risk of severe pertussis complications, vaccination is recommended. Individual cases should be discussed with the specialist.50 15.7 Potential responses and AEFIs Unless the specic con traindications and precautions outlined in section 15.6 above are present, practitioners should have no hesitation in advising the administration of acellular pertu ssis vaccine. Acellular pertussis vaccine has been used in New Zealand since 2000 and is significantly less reactogenic than the whole -cell pertussis well tolerated in children,73 including preterm (24 to 36 weeks ' gestation) and/or low birthweight (820 -2,020 g) infants.74, 75 Local reactions commonly include pain, redness, swelling and induration at the injection site. Less common reactions include fretfulness, anorexia, vomiting, crying and slight to moderate fever. These local and systemic reactions usually occur within several hours of pertussis immunisation and spontaneously resolve within 48 hours without sequelae.73 Local reactions increase with age and additional doses of vaccine. The reaction may be due to some of the other vaccine components, such as aluminium. These reactions are usually minor and only last a day or so. 15.7.2 Tdap vaccine The adult reduced -concentration Tdap (Boostrix) vaccines have been found to have no safety concerns in those aged 10 -64 years and those aged over 65 years.76, 77, 78, 79 Studies of Tdap in pregnant women have not identified any increased risk of adverse maternal, infant or fetal outcomes.12, 71, 80, 81, 82 Local reactions following immunisation of adolescents with Tdap are common but usually mild. They include pain (in 75 percent of recipients), swelling (21 percent ) and redness (23 percent ) at the injection site.83 Potential systemic reactions following immunisation of adolescents with Tdap include fever >38\u00b0C (5 percent ), headache (16 percent ), fatigue (14 percent ) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10 percent ).83 15.7.3 Major adverse events associated with pertussis -containing vaccines The incidence of major adverse events following primary pertussis immunisation is summarised in Table 15.2. 360 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 15.2: Incidence of major adverse reactions following acellular pertussis vaccines (based on clinical trial data for DTaP vaccines) Event following immunisation Timing post-vaccination Incidenc e per 100,000 doses High fever >38 \u00b0C 0-2 days 36 Persistent (>3 hours) inconsolable 44 Seizures episode 0-2 days 0-47a Anaphylaxis 0-1 hour Very rare a. Across clinical trials of multiple licensed DTaP formulations Source: Edwards KM, Decker MD. 2018. Pertussis vaccines. In: Plotkin S, Orenstein W, Offit P, et al (eds) Plotkin 's Vaccines (7th edition) . Elsevier . Parents should be alerted to the small but defined risk of extensive limb swelling to the injected thigh or upper arm, particularly following the fourth and fifth DTaP dose. This transient, usually painless and benign swelling occurs in 2 -3 percent of children.73 Resolution occurs without sequelae and it is not a contraindication for further pertussis vaccine doses.72, 84 Neither a hypotonic -hyporesponsive episode nor seizures are associated with long - term consequences for the child (see section 2.3.3).85, 86, 87 Children who have febrile seizures after pertussis immunisation do not have an increase d risk of subsequent seizures or neurodevelopmental disability.88 It is safe to give acellular pertussis vaccine after a hypoto nic-hyporesponsive episode has occurred following a previous dose.89 A significant decrease of 60 -67 percent in hypotonic -hyporesponsive episodes was observed in Canada following the switch from whole cell to acellular pertussis vaccines.90 15.8 Public health measures 15.8.1 Improving pertussis control The goal of the pertussis immunisati on programme is to protect those most at risk of developing severe disease; that is, infants in the rst year of life. Two key strategies for reducing the burden of disease in infants are the administration of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy and on -time infant immunisation. Vaccination during pregnancy is recommended and funded for women from the second trimester, preferably from 16 weeks ' gestation (see section 15.5.2 ). This is the most effective way to protect young infants. More complete and timely delivery of the current infant immunisation schedule would reduce the infant pertussis disease burden in older infants.67 It is important that all children attending early childhood services are fully vaccinated for their age. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 361 Data on the protective effects of indirect strategies is currently incomplete. 'Cocoon strategy ' is the term used to describe the protection of infants by immunising those who are potential sources of B. pertussis .91 Three identified target groups who have the most contact with young and vulnerable infants are (1) new mothers who have not had recent immunisation, family and close contacts of newborns; (2) health care workers; and (3) early childhood workers. S ome protection may be provided to infants by cocoon immunisation of parents and other potential household contacts post -partum, may be pertinent in some circumstances where maternal vaccination did not occur, such as preterm birth, and infants in neonatal intensive care.92 Health care workers in particular are at increased risk of pertussis and can transmit pertussis to other health care workers and to patients.93 Outbreaks in maternity wards, neonatal units and outpatient settings have been described.94 Fatalities occur as a result of such nosocomial spread.95 Mass i mmunisation cannot be used to control a n estab lished community outbreak, although action to update age -appropriate vaccination in institutional settings (schools and early childhood services for staff and students ) is appropriate. When an outbreak occurs , individual immunisation status should be check ed, and any missing doses given. Vaccination in pregnancy is particularly important to protect the most vulnerable, young infants . 15.8.2 Notification It is a legal requirement that all cases of pertussis be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. A suspected pertussis case can be confirmed if a clinically compatible illness is laboratory -confirmed or is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case. Because transmission is by aerosolised droplets, health care personnel looking aft er pertussis cases should be vaccinated and wear a mask. 15.8.3 Laboratory diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection PCR is the most sensitive method for diagnosing B. pertussis infection. In general, B. pertussis can be identified by PCR from most upper respiratory tract samples, including throat swabs, for up to four to six weeks after symptom onset. Serology should only be done in consultation with the medical officer of health and the local microbiologist for public health purposes. 362 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A negative test do es not necessarily rule out pertussis: consider exposure, clinical compatibility, the test used and the timing of the test. For further information about laboratory testing, refer to the Pertussis chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (availa A range of anti biotics are available for the treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis. Prompt treatment with macrolide antibiotics may reduce the severity and duration of clinical disease if started during the catarrhal phase. Antibiotics commenced after coughing paroxysms have begun have no effect on the clinical disease but do reduce the risk of spread of disease to others.73, 96, 97 Antibiotics are of limited value if started after 21 days of illness, but should be considered where there are high -risk contacts (eg, young infants and pregnant women). Refer to the Pertussis chapter of the Communicable Disease Control -2012 ). To minimise transmission to newborn infants, it is recommended that pregnant women diagnosed with pertussis in the third trimester be treate d with appropriate antibiotics (see Table 15.3), if within six weeks of cough onset.99 Macrolide use during pregnancy, lactation and in the neonatal period has been associated with 2 -3 times increased risk of infantile pyloric stenosis (which affects 1-3 in 1 ,000 infants).100, 101 The risk is lower when given during pregnancy and breastfeeding than when given to the infant during the neonatal period.102 With erythromycin, the risk is highest when given within the first two weeks of life (relative risk 10.7; 95% CI: 5.2 -21.9), and increased duration of treatment.102, 103, 104 The risk is presumed to be lower with azithromycin, although there are case reports of infantile pyloric stenosis occurring when azithromycin has been used during pregnancy. Parents should be informed of the risks of this complicat ion and of the symptoms and signs of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The infant should be monitored for this complication for four weeks after completion of treatment.73, 105, 106 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 363 Table 15.3: Recommended antimicrobial therapy and post -exposure prophylaxis for pertussis in infants, children, adolescents and adults Azithromycina Trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazoleb Age Recommended Age Recommended Younger than 4 weeks Day 1: 10 mg/kg per day in a single daily dose Days 2 -5: 5 mg/kg per day in a single daily dose Under 2 months Contraindicated (risk for kernicterus) From age 1 month older, and children Day 1: 10 mg/kg per day in a single daily dose (maximum 500 mg per day) Days 2 -5: 5 mg/kg per day in a single daily dose (maximum 250 mg per day) Aged 2 months or older TMP, 8 mg/kg per day ; SMX, 40 mg/kg/ day in 2 divided doses for 14 days Adolescents and adults Day 1: 500 mg as a single dose Days 2 -5: 250 mg once daily Adolescents and adults TMP, 320 mg per day ; SMX, 1,600 mg/day in 2 divided doses for 14 days a.

Adapted from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 2005. Recommended antimicrobial agents for treatment and post exposure prophylaxis of pertussis. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 54(RR14): 1 -16. Exclusion Exclude the case from school, early childhood services, other institutions or work until they have received at least two days of azithromycin (this lengthens to five days if other antibiotics, are used), or exclude them for three weeks from the date of onset of typical paroxysms of cough or until the end of the cough, whichever comes fi rst.98 Children who have laboratory -confirmed pertussis should complete their immunisation series with all the scheduled doses recommended for their age. 15.8.5 Management of contacts The local medical officer of health will advise on the management of contacts. For more details on control measures, see the latest version o f the 'Pertussis ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual .98 A contact can be defined as someone who has been in close proximity (within one metre)105 of the index case for one hour or more during the case 's infectious period. Contacts include household members , those who have stayed overnight in the same room, and those who have had face -to-face contact with the case.98 364 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Those most at risk from pertussis and high -priority contacts for public health follow -up are: children aged under 12 months; particularly those whose mothers did not received Tdap in pregnancy or who have receiv ed fewer than two pertussis -containing vaccine dos es by 14 days prior to exposure children and adults who live with, or spend time around a child including in health care and education settings unvaccinated pregnant women, especially in the last month of p regnancy individuals at risk of severe illness or complications (eg, with chronic respiratory conditions, congenital heart disease or immune deficiency). As the evidence for the effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis of contacts is limited, antibiotics are cur rently only recommended for household or household -like settings where high -priority contacts as listed above reside - if prophylaxis is given, all members of the contact group should receive it. Health care workers are frequently exposed to B. pertussis. Although the greatest priority is given to protecting young infants and unimmunised children, there are well -documented examples of spread from staff to older adult patients. Pertussis in adults can be debilitating and can cause significant morbidity in th ose with respiratory disease. Refer to the Pertussis chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www.health.govt. nz/our -work/diseases -and-conditions/communicable - disease -control -manual/pertussis ). Restriction Any contacts, high priority or otherwise, should be advised to avoid attending early childhood services, school, work or community gatherings if they become symptomatic. It is important to clearly explain that symptoms in the early stages of pertussis are indistinguishable from minor respiratory tract infections, and pertussis is highly contagious.98 Refer to the Pertussis chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www.health.govt.nz/our -work/diseases -and-conditions/communicable - disease -control -manual/pertussis ). 15.9 Variations vaccine data -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) and DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV) data state that these vaccines are indicated for primary immunisation of infants and as a booster dose for children. The Ministry of Health recommends that DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 365 DTaP-IPV vaccines may also be used for catch -up of the primary schedule in children aged under 10 years (see Appendix 2 ). The data sheets for DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP and Tdap (Boostrix) state that these are contraindicated in children with encephalopathy of unknown aetiology or with neurologic complications occurring within seven days following a vaccine dose. The Ministry of Health recommends that the on ly contraindication is a history of anaphylaxis to a previous dose or to any of the vaccine components (see section 15.6.1 ). The risks and benefits of withholding va ccination until the clinical situation has stabilised should be considered on an individual basis (see section 15.6.2). Tdap is not approved for use (registered) for primary immunisation. However, the Ministry of Health recommends that children aged from 7 years and adults may receive Tdap for catch -up of the primary schedule (see Appendix 2 ). The Tdap data sheet states that the vaccine may be used during pregnancy when the possible advantages outweigh the possible risks for the fetus. However, the Ministry of Health recommends Tdap vaccine for all pregnant women from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester, but at least two weeks before birth. It is funded when given any time in second or third trimester (see section 15.5.2 ). References 1. Fine P, Mulholland K, Scott J, et al. 2018. Community protection .

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 371 16 Pneumococcal disease Key information Mode of transmission Contact with respiratory droplets. Incubation period Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage is common. The incubation period is variable and may be as short as 1 -3 days. Incidence and burden of disease Highest at extremes of age (<2 years and >75 years), Mori and Pacific people, those with multiple comorbidities and with immunocompromise. Funded vaccines All children aged under 5 years: PCV10 (Synflorix). Children and adults with eligible conditions: PCV13 (Preve nar 13) 23PPV (Pneumovax 23). Dose, presentation and route All vaccines: 0.5 mL per dose pre-filled syringe intramuscular injection (23PPV also be given subcutaneously). Funded vaccine indications and schedule PCV10 at ages 6 weeks, 5 month s and 12 months, and age -appropriate catch -up for children <5 years; or, PCV13 and 23PPV: vaccination or re -vaccination at any age with eligible conditions testing for primary immune deficiencies. Vaccine efficacy For pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: reduc tions in pneumococcal disease and carriage of vaccine serotypes in vaccinated populations, plus herd immunity effects reducing pneumococcal disease in other age groups; some increases in disease caused by non -vaccine serotypes. Precautions and special considerations Concomitant PCV13 and influenza vaccine may increase risk of fever and febrile convulsions in children aged 6 months to <5 years. 23PPV should not be given to children aged under 2 years due to the reduced immune response associated with polysaccharide vaccines. 16.1 Bacteriology Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram -positive diplococcus. It is ubiquitous, and many individuals carry the organism asymptomatically in their upper respiratory tract.1 There are over 90 identiable serotypes of S. pneumoniae . Certain serotypes are more 372 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 invasive or more associated with antibiotic resistanc e, and dominant serotypes vary by age and geographical distribution. See section 16.4.1 and Table 16.1 for a summary of the serotypes contained in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). 16.2 Clinical features The human nasopharynx is the only natural reservoir of S. pneumoniae . Carriage rates in young children range from 21 percent in high -income settings to more than 90 percent in resource -limited countries.1 Transmission of S. pneumoniae is by contact with respiratory droplets. Although nasopharyngeal colonisation precedes disease, most who are coloni sed do not develop disease. The nasopharynx is a source of spread between individuals, so reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae vaccine serotypes in vaccinated children decreases transmission to adults. Transmission of pneumococci and invasive p otential is increased by concomitant viral upper respiratory tract infection, especially influenza. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined by isolation of S. pneumoniae from a usually sterile site, such as blood, pleural fluid or cerebrospinal fluid , and represents the most severe end of the disease spectrum. The most common clinical syndromes in IPD are bacteraemic pneumonia, non -localised bacteraemia and meningitis. Older adults generally have bacteraemic pneumonia, while young children may have an y of the three, with meningitis being the most severe. Pneumonia without bacteraemia is up to five times more common than bacteraemic pneumonia, especially in older adults, where it also has high mortality. Other non - invasive infections include acute otit is media (predominantly in children) and sinusitis (predominantly older children and adults). The period between colonisation with S. pneumoniae and infection is variable but may be as short as one to three days. 16.3 Epidemiology 16.3.1 Global burden of disease Pneumococcal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Rates of disease and death are highest in low -income countries with the majority of deaths occurring in sub -Saharan Africa and Asia.2 Along with the very old and very young, patients with underlying cardiorespiratory disease and congenital or acquired immunosuppression have the highest rates of disease. Risk of disease increases with multiple comorbidities and lifestyle factors (this is described as risk-stacking, see section 16.5.4 ).3 The risk of IPD in children and adults with two or more comorbid conditions can be as high as in those with a recognised 'high-risk' condition.4 Lifestyle factors, s uch as passive smoking, environmental and workplace pollutions, smoking IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 373 and alcohol dependency, can increase the risk of severe pneumococcal disease, especially in those with chronic illnesses that predispose them to infection, such as asthma, diabetes, dementia and mental illness.5, 6 Socioeconomic depriv ation, homelessness and overcrowding have also been associated with increased risk of IPD.7 The WHO estimates that 300,000 (range 200 -370,000) children aged under 5 years died from pneumococcal infections, representing around 5 percent of all -cause mortality in this age group, in 2015.8 An additiona l 23,000 (15 -40,000) deaths were estimated to occur in children co -infected with HIV. On average 75 percent of IPD and 83 percent of pneumococcal meningitis cases are aged under 2 years but the incidence and age distribution vary by country and socioeconom ic status.8 Importantly, at least one quarter of survivors of pneumococcal meningitis experience long -term sequalae such as hearing loss, seizures, mental and motor abnormalities. In each geographical region globally, PCV10 and PCV13 were shown to cover more than 7 0 percent of the serotypes causing IPD under 5 years of age during 1980 -2007 prior to PCV introduction (PCV10 range 70 -94 percent and 74 -88 percent for PCV13).8 16.3.2 Global ep idemiology since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines Direct impact of PCV programmes on IPD in children Reductions in IPD among target cohorts of children in high income countries have been similar for PCV10 and PCV7/13 in reported studies. Qu\u00e9bec (PCV10 and 13) and Finland (PCV10) both used 2+1 schedules and observed 83 percent and 79 percent reductions in IPD in vaccine -eligible children, respectively.9, 10 In England, using PCV7 then PCV13 in a 2+1 schedule, there was an estimated 5,000 (54 percent ) fewer hospital admissions for bacteraemia, meningitis and pneumonia in children aged under 5 years over 12 years after the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13. The greatest reductions were seen in meningitis (by 71 percent ) in children under 2 years age.11 Direct impact of vaccination on non -invasive pneumococcal disease The impact of pneumococcal conjuga te vaccination on the large burden of non-invasive pneumococcal disease has been clearly demonstrated internationally in countries that have introduced these vaccines, particularly through reductions in childhood hospitalisations due to pneumonia.12, 13 Other impacts, such as on acute otitis media, are less clear and more difficult to measure accurately.14 However, a systematic review found PCVs were associated with large reductions in risk of pneumococcal acute otitis media, but there was no evidence of bene fit against all-cause otitis media in high -risk children over 1 year of age or older children with a history of respiratory illness.15 374 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Herd immunity The extent to which childhood PCV immunisation programmes provide indirect reductions in IPD among high -risk children and older adults va ries between reports, settings and vaccine serotype (notably serotypes 3 and 19A). There is some good evidence for the indirect (herd) effects of infant PCV immunisation on vaccine serotype pneumococcal disease in the non -vaccinated population, especially in adults aged 65 years and older, and an all age -effect on non -bacteraemic pneumonia.16 This includes data showing reductions in the rates of IPD due to PCV7 and, more recently, PCV13 serotypes in non -vaccinated groups in many countries (for both pneumonia and IPD in adults) in North America and Europe,11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Reductions in adult pneumococcal pneumonia have also been observed in Western Kenya following the introduction of PCV10 in children27 and in Japanese community -dwelling older adults following the introduction of PCV13.28 These herd effects are predominantly due to decreased nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine types in immunised children lowering transmission to unimmunised older children and adults. Although many countries have reported significant decreases in vaccine -type IPD among children and the wider population following the introduction of PCVs to the childhood schedules, IPD due to non -PCV serotypes has increased in some, particularly in older adults.29, 30 Therefore, for direct protection against a broad range of serotypes 23PPV continues to be necess ary for those at highest risk of IPD. 16.3.3 New Zealand epidemiology Pneumococcal disease occurs throughout the year, but is more common in the autumn and winter months.31, 32 In the pre -PCV era, incidence of IPD was highest in infants and the elderly, especially among Mori and Pacific peoples.31, 33, 34, 35 Isolates from cases of IPD are serotyped at ESR and detailed information by age group is regularly updated on the ESR Public Health Surveillance website (available at www.surv.esr.cri.nz/sur veillance/IPD.php ). Incidence and mortality In 2019, there were 497 notified IPD cases and the overall notification rate was 10.1 cases per 100,000 population (ESR, 26 June 2020). The highest rates of IPD were in adults aged 85 years and older (46.4 per 1 00,000) and in children aged under 1 year (30.2 per 100,000), followed by adults aged 75 -84 years (24.2 per 100,000) and 65 -74 years (21.4 per 100,000). The age -standardised rates of IPD were highest for the Pacific peoples (37.0 per 100,000, 79 cases) and Mori (28.9 per 100,000, 113 cases) ethnic groups. These rates were 5.7 and 4.4 times higher than the age -standardised rate for the European/Other ethnic group (16.5 per 100,000, 431 cases). The incidence of IPD was 3.7 -fold higher for those living in are as with the highest levels of deprivation than those living in low deprivation areas across all age groups (18.8 vs 5.0 per 100,000). IPD was recorded as the primary cause of death for 11 cases in 2019, including two children aged under 5 years. In 2019, t he most reported risk factors in cases aged under 5 years were children attending day care (45.5 percent ) followed by smoking in IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 375 the household (27.8 percent ), and for cases aged 5 years and older it was having a chronic illness (63.9 percent ) (ESR, 26 June 2020). New Zealand epidemiology since the introduction of PCV PCV7 was introduced in June 2008, PCV10 in July 2011 and PCV13 in July 2014, PCV10 replaced PCV13 in July 2017 on the routine Schedule (see Appendix 1 ). As of July 2020, the number of primary doses of PCV10 were reduced to two (at age 6 weeks and 5 months) and the booster dose was brought forward from 15 months to 12 months in October 2020. IPD incidence There have been dramatic reductions in the incidence of IPD in the vaccine -eligible age groups in New Zealand since the introduction of PCV to the Schedule in 2008 (see Figure 16.1). In children aged under 2 years, the total rate of IPD has decreased by 87.7 percent since the introduction of PCV to the Schedule in 2008: from 100.3 per 100,000 for 2006 -0736 to 22.4 per 100,000 in 2019 (ESR, 26 June 2020). The reduction in PCV7 serotypes was even greater (see Figure 16.2), with no cases of PCV7 serotype IPD were detected in children aged under 2 years during 2019 (ESR , 26 June 2020). Similar reductions were seen for IPD caused by PCV10 and PCV13 serotypes under 2 years (see Figure 16.2). IPD incidence decreased in children aged 2 -4 years, for all - cause IPD (50.5 percent ; Figure 16.1) and IPD caused by PCV serotypes (77.6 percent ; Figure 16.2) (ESR , 26 June 2020). In 2019, 26.9 percent of cases in adults aged 65 years and over were PCV13 serotypes, and 69.9 percent were due to 23PPV se rotypes. Of these, 12.4 percent (24/193 cases) were due to serotype 19A, and 43.0 percent were due to 23PPV -non-PCV13 serotypes (ESR, 26 June 2020). Figure 16.1: Rate per 100,000 of invasive pneumococcal di sease by age group and year, 2006 -2017 376 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 16.2: Rate per 100,000 population of invasive pneumococcal disease due to PCV7 serotypes, additional PCV10 types, additional PCV13 types and non -PCV types, by age group and year, 2006 -2017 Notes: PCV7 was introduced in 2008, PCV10 in 2011, in 2014 and PCV10 reintroduced in 2017. 'PCV7 serotypes ' are cases due to serotypes covered (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 23F); 'Serotypes 1, 5, 7F and 19A ' are cases due to the additional serotypes covered by PCV10; 'Serotypes 3 and 6A ' are cases due to the additional serotypes covered by PCV13; and 'Other serotypes ' are all other culture -positive IPD cases. IPD became a notifiable disease in 2008. Data presented from 2009 onwards is based on IPD notifications, and data prior to 2009 is from ESR 's national laboratory -based surveillance of IPD. Pneumococcal serotypes Of the 497 IPD cases notified in 2019, 466 isolates were referred to ESR for serotyping. In children aged under 5 years, 65.8 percent (25/38) of cases were due to serotypes n ot covered by PCV, compared with 71.5 percent (171/239) and 72.5 percent (137/189) in the 5 -64 years and 65 years and older age groups (ESR, 26 June 2020). Serotype 19A was the most common serotype (65 cases) in 2019, increasing from 3 cases in 2015 to 10 cases in 2019 in children aged under 5 years. In adults aged 65 years or older, serotype 22F was the most prevalent non -vaccine serotype in 2019 (20 cases compared with 40 cases in 2015; ESR, 26 June 2020). Herd immunity The addition of PCV to the New Ze aland schedule in 2008 was followed by significant reductions in IPD due to PCV7 serotypes in age groups not eligible for routine infant immunisation ( Figure 16.2). Since notification -based surveillance began in 2009, the rate of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes in the 5 -64 year age group decreased 87 percent IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 377 from 3.8 per 100,000 to 0.5 per 100,000 in 2019, and the rate in cases aged 65 years and over decreased 94 percent from 26.6 to 1.5 per 100,000 (ESR, 26 June 2020). However, the total rate of IPD in adults did not fall dramatically (rate for age 5 -64 years: 6.1 to 6.7 per 100,000; age 65 years and over: 34.2 to 31.3 per 100,000). Impact of vaccina tion on non -invasive pneumococcal disease While hospitalisations for respiratory infections in children aged 5 years and under have been increasing in New Zealand, hospitalisations for all -cause pneumonia have declined significantly since the implementation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine programme in 2008. The largest reductions in all -cause pneumonia hospitalisations between 2006 and 2015 were in Mori (a 12 percent reduction) and Pacific children (a 21 percent reduction) and those livi ng in areas of high deprivation.37 A 51 percent decline in otitis media hospitalisations was observed for Mori children aged under 6 years following PCV immunisation, compared with 8 percent decline in otitis media across all ethnicities.37 Antimicrobial resistance Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has reduced the circulation of resistant pneumococcal serotypes in the US,38 but little change has been seen in New Zealand since PCV introduction. S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin (14.1 -23.5 percent ) and cefotaxime resistance (0.4 -2.1 percent ) has varied year -to-year over the last decade with no significant trend.39 In 2017, PCV7 serotypes accounted for 10.3 percent of the penicillin -resistant isolates compared with 92. 8 percent in 2006/07, but the prevalence of penicillin resistance among serotype 19A isolates increased just over 4 -fold from 15.8 percent in 2006/07 to 68.3 percent in 2017. Together types 19F, 19A, 15A and 15B mu ltidrug -resistant invasive pneumococci (ESR, 26 June 2020). 16.4 Vaccines 16.4.1 Available vaccines There are two types of pneumococcal vaccine registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) in New Zealand for use against S. pneumoniae : pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCVs) with 10 or 13 serotypes and a plain polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) containing 23 serotypes. In PCV vaccines, the pneumococcal surface polysaccharide is coupled to a carrier protein that induces increased production of type -specifi c antibodies, particularly in children aged under 2 years, and immunological memory, enabling booster responses with subsequent doses (see section 1.4.3). Table 16.1summarises the polysaccharide serotypes contained within each vaccine. 378 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 16.1: Summary antibodies against serotype 6A and 19A, respectively, but at a lower level than PCV13.8 Funded vaccines PCV10 (Synflorix, GSK) and 3 \u00b5g of serotype 4, conjugated to a total of 9 -16 \u00b5g of non -typeable Haemophilus \u00b5g of diphtheria toxoid, adsorbed onto 0.5 mg of aluminium phosphate 4.3 mg of sodium chloride and water for injection. PCV10 contains no preservative. PCV13 (Prevenar 13, Pfizer) Each 0.5 mL dose of PCV13 contains: 2.2 g of pneumococcal purified capsular polysaccharides for 14, 18C, to non -toxic diphtheria CRM197 protein and onto aluminium phosphate (0. 565 mg) succinic acid, polysorbate 80, aluminium phosphate, phosphate, and sodium chloride in water for injection. 23PPV (Pneumovax 23, MSD) Each 0.5 mL dose of 25 \u00b5g of each capsular polysaccharide antigen injection , phenol (0.25 percent ) added as vaccine IPD Two key rando mised controlled trials have demonstrated the protective efficacy of PCV10 against pneumococcal disease.40 The Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) study investigated a two - or three -dose infant series plus a toddler booster. Vaccine ef ficacy against vaccine -serotype IPD was 100 percent (95% CI: 83 -100) for 3+1 schedule and 92 percent (95% CI: 58 -100) for the 2+1 schedule. Based on national hospital discharge register data, vaccine efficacy was 71 percent (95% CI: 52 -83) for patient file-verified non -laboratory -confirmed 42 The Clinical Otitis Media and Pneumonia Study (COMPAS) showed PCV10 efficacy to be 100 percent (95% CI: CI: 11.1 -86.2) against any IPD.43 In this study, approximately 24,000 infants received PCV10 or HepB at ages 2, 4 and 6 months with a booster at age 15 -18 months as part of the phase III trial conducted in Latin America (Argentina, Colombia and Panama). Two observational studies in Brazil examined effectiveness of PCV10 (as a 3+1 schedule) post -introduction in 2010. A matched case -control study of 316 cases of IPD and 1,219 neighbourhood age -matched controls showed adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against vaccine -serotype IPD of 8 3.8 percent an age -appropriate PCV10 schedule.44 A study based on data obtained from the Information System on Notifiable Diseases from 2007 to 2012 found two years after the introduction of routine PCV10 vaccin ations that there was a decrease in pneumococcal meningitis morbidity and mortality in children aged under 2 years.45 Overall, the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis decreased by 50 percent from 3.7 per 100,000 population in 2007 to 1.84 per 100,000 in 2012. Mortality decreased by 69 percent from 1.3 to 0.4 per 100,000. The greatest impact of PCV10 vaccination was in infants aged 6 -11 months, with a 73 percent reduction in pneumococcal meningitis incidence and an 85 percent reduction in mortality.45 Non-IPD pneumonia The FinIP trial found vaccine effectiveness against all h ospital -diagnosed pneumonia was 25.2 percent (95% CI: 2.6 -42.6) the 3+1 PCV10 schedule (95% CI: 5.5 -44.6) for the 2+1 schedule.40 In Brazil, there was a significant decrease of 12.7 percent (p<0.001) in all -cause pneumonia hospitalisations of children aged under 4 years between the pre (2002 -2009) and post -PCV10 (2011 -2012) periods, in the absence of any reduction in non-respiratory -cause hospitalisations (p=0.39).46 Active population -based surveillance studies in Central Brazil (across 17 paediatric hospitals) found around a 25 percent reduction in the rate of X-ray-confirmed pneumonia in children aged 2 -23 months.47 Five years after the introduction of PCV10 in Brazil, pneumonia hospitalisations significantly reduced, both in vaccine -targeted children (17.4 -26.5 percent ) and age groups not targeted for vaccination (11.1 -27.1 percent for ages 10 -49 years), but not in those aged 65 years or older.48 380 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Otitis media In the COMPAS trial, a post -hoc intent -to-treat analysis found that vaccine efficacy against bacteriologically -serotype pneumococcal AOM.43 Although PCV10 has against non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) confirmed -AOM,43 following the introduction of PCV10 in New Zealand, no reduction in NTHi density in the nasopharyngeal or middle -ear microbiology in children with established ear disease was observed; NTHi remained the dominant pathogen for o titis media.49, 50 In a follow -up of the FinIP stu dy, vaccine efficacy of PCV10 against all respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children aged under 2 years was 12 percent (95% CI: 2 -22), 23 percent (95% CI: 0 -40) against RTIs with AOM, and (95% CI: 0 -19) against RTIs without AOM. Most of the se infections were caused by rhinovirus.51 Despite low efficacy against any AOM (7 -13 percent ), the high incide nce rate of AOM meant that related factors (antimicrobial prescriptions and tympanostomy tube placements) contributed to 95 percent of the reduction in total disease burden post PCV10, compared with 0.6 percent for laboratory -confirmed IPD.52 Similarly in Iceland, PCV10 introduction was associated with a 5.8 percent (95% CI: 1.6 -9.8) reduction in all - cause antimicrobial prescriptions and 21.8 percent (95% CI: 11.5 -30.9) reduction in AOM -associated prescriptions in up to 3 years of age.53 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Individuals at increased risk of IPD Few studies have investigated the immunogenicity and effectiveness of PCV13 in individuals at increased risk of IPD. Studies using pneumococcal vaccines with similar but fewer antigens have demonstrated vaccine efficacy in individuals with immunocompromising conditions (eg, HIV, sickle cell disease), but the duration of protection against IPD remains unknown.54 High IgG titres have been demonstrated following PCV13 vaccination of children with sickle cell disease,55 HIV infection56 and nephrotic syndrome.57 WHO recommends that children with medical conditions that reduce humoral immune response to vaccines, such as HIV, sickle cell disease and primary immune deficiencies, to have a 3+1 schedule of PCV13.8 In children and ado lescents with underlying medical conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cancer, cystic fibrosis or asthma, the broader serotype protection provided by PCV13 can reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and the associated risk of IPD.58, 59, 60, 61 Use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in adults PCV13 induces robust immune responses in adults,62, 63, 64, 65 including elderly adults.66 Although the antibody titres vary with serotype and between age groups, particularly for those aged over 65 years, the clinical significance of this variation is unclear.63 PCV13 is at least as immunogenic as 23P PV in adults. Some studies suggest that 23PPV IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 381 attenuates the immune response to subsequent doses of PCV13, not seen if PCV13 is given before 23PPV; PCV13 may augment the response to subsequent 23PPV vaccination.66, 67, 68 With respect to clinical outcomes, the Community -Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPITA) was a large randomised placebo -controlled trial conduc ted in the Netherlands that assessed efficacy of PCV13 against pneumococcal community - acquired pneumonia (CAP) with and without IPD in adults aged 65 years and older. The efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine -type IPD was 75 percent (95% -90.8) -65.3) for both combined.69 Although this study showed individual protection for vaccine -type CAP, there was no significant reduction in all -cause pneumonia.69 An important unce rtainty is the extent of indirect protection in vaccine -type IPD cases stemming from childhood immunisation programmes, which varies between countries. Where vaccine serotypes are sufficiently prevalent, PCV13 would provide some protection against all -cause CAP and lobular pneumonia.70 Some of the non -PCV13 vaccine serotypes more likely to cause disease in adults are covered by 23PPV. Data is limited for younger adults and specific at -risk adult populations. 23-valent vaccine pneumococca l polysaccharide The polysaccharide vaccine from polysaccharides of 23 serotypes of S. pneumoniae . It is available in New Zealand for adults and children from age 2 years. The 23 serotypes included in 23PP V (see Table 16.1) are responsible for about 90 percent or more of IPD in high -income countries. See recent IPD surveillance reports from ESR for prevalence of serotyp es covered by 23PPV in New Zealand (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/IPD.php ). A meta -analysis of IPD in adults aged from 65 years in 10 European countries showed that incidence of PCV7 serotypes had declined by 77 percent and for additional PCV13 serotypes by 38 percent after 5 years of PCV13/PCV10 programmes. The incid ence rate of 23PPV -non-PCV13 serotypes had increased by around 50 percent with these 11 serotypes causing 22 -54 percent of IPD.71 In 2016, more than two -thirds of IPD cases in adul ts age 65 years older were 23PPV -non-PCV13 serotypes.39 The efcacy of 23PPV varies depending on whether immune -competent or immunocompromised patients are studied, and whether the end point is pneumococcal pneumonia or bacteraemia. The limitations of the polysaccharide vaccine have been summarised as: reduced efcacy in high -risk individuals uncertain efcacy against pneumonia it is only suitable for children aged 2 years and older. waning protection 2.5 to 5 years after vaccination. 382 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A 2017 meta -analysis from Germany found pooled VE for 23PPV against any serotype IPD of 45 percent -65), percent (95% CI: 10-92) across cohort, case -control or clinical trial data; and pooled VE against any serotyp e pneumococcal pneumonia of 48 percent (95% CI: 25 -63) and 64 percent (95% CI: 35 -80) in cohort studies and clinical trials.72 For both outcomes, waning of protection was found between 2.5 years and 5 years of follow -up after PPV23.72 Other systematic reviews, with differing eligibility criteria, found lower pooled VE estimates against IPD or pneumococcal pneumonia for 23PPV.73, 74, 75 A Japanese prospective study found 23PPV to have mo derate but variable effectiveness against vaccine -type pneumococcal pneumonia in adults aged 65 years or older.76 Hence, questions remain around the clinical effectiveness and intervals between repeat doses of PPV23 that provide continued protection. 16.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) +8\u00b0C. Do not freeze. 16.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of PCV10, PCV13 and 23PPV is 0.5 mL, administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). 23PPV can also be administered by subcutaneous injection (see section 2.2.3), but there is an increased likelihood of injection -site reactions.77 Co-administration with other vaccines PCV10, PCV13 or 23PPV may be administered at the same time as other routine childhood vaccinations, in a separate syringe at a separate injection site (see section 2.2.7 for information about multiple injections at the same visit). The only exception is PCV13 with the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY -D, which should be given at le ast four weeks after PCV13. This is because, when these vaccines were administered concurrently during clinical trials, impairment of the antibody response to some of the pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 4, 6B and 18C) was reported.78, 79 PCV13 has been associated with increased risk of fever over 39\u00b0C and febrile convulsions when co -administered with inactivated influenza vaccine in children aged 6 months to under 5 years. Separation of the vaccines by two days can be offered but is not essential (see section 16.6.2 ). Systemic reactions have been noted in adults aged over 65 years. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 383 Herpes zoster vaccine can be concomitantly delivered with 23PPV (see also section 23.4.4 ).80, 81 16.5 Recommended immunisation schedule 16.5.1 Usual childhood schedule (PCV10) PCV10 for children aged under 5 years PCV10 (Synflorix) vaccine is funded for all children aged under 5 years. Two doses of PCV10 are given as the primary course, with a booster at age 12 months ( Table 16.2). Children who started their immunisation course with PCV13 can complete it with PCV10. Table 16.2: Usual childhood PCV10 (Synflorix) schedule Age Vaccine Comment 6 weeks PCV10 Primary series 5 months PCV10 Primary series 12 months PCV10 Booster Where a previously unimmunised child aged under 5 years presents late for pneumococcal vaccination, the age -appropriate catch -up schedules in Appendix 2 should be fo llowed. 16.5.2 Extended pneumococcal immunisation for high-risk groups As part of the extended immunisation programme for high -risk groups, PCV13 and 23PPV are funded for eligible individuals, as shown in Table 16.3, Table 16.4 and Table 16.5. Because the recommended schedule depends on the age of the individual at diagnosis, the tables have been organised into age groups (under 5 years, 5-18 years and 18 years and older). The PCV13 and 23PPV funding restrictions are as follows. See Table 16.3, Table 16.4 and Table 16.5 for the eligible conditions and dosing requirements . 384 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 PCV13 All high -risk infants are recommended to receive at least three doses of a PCV vaccine, with at least one dose after 12 months of age. Change from PCV10 to PCV13 as soon as the infant is diagnosed as being at high risk. Two doses of PCV13 are funded for high -risk children aged from 12 months and under 18 years who have previously received two or three doses o f PCV10. Up to four doses of PCV13 are funded for vaccination or re -vaccination of high -risk children aged under 5 years. Up to four doses of PCV13 are funded for vaccination or re -vaccination of eligible individuals aged 5 years and older. 23PPV Up to three doses of 23PPV are funded for individuals with eligible conditions. Up to two doses of 23PPV are funded for high -risk children aged under 18 years. See also section 16.5.3 '(Re)vaccination '. See sections 4.2 and 4.3 for more informa tion about immunocompromised infants, children and adults, including additional vaccine recommendations and schedule tables for certain conditions.

If 23PPV has already been given (prior to any doses of PCV13) to adults aged 18 years and older, wait at least 1 year before administering PCV13. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 387 16.5.3 four doses of PCV13 are funded: 1. For vaccination or re -vaccination of high -risk children aged under 5 years (as listed in Table 16.3) 2. For (re)vaccination of childr en and adults aged 5 years and older: with HIV who are pre - or post -HSCT or chemotherapy who are pre - or post -splenectomy, or with functional asplenia who are pre - or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis with complement deficiency (acquire d or inherited) with cochlear implants with primary immune deficiency. See also sections 4.3 and 4.6. 16.5.4 Recommended but not funded Risk stacking Two classifications of IPD risk are recognised: 'high-risk' conditions for which there is significant risk of IPD and 'at-risk' conditions, which on their own may not significantly increase risk, but when combined together or with lifestyle risk factors increase an individual 's risk of IPD. This is described as 'risk stacking ' - IPD incidence substantially increases with the accumulation of concurrent risk factors or conditions.3, 4 The risk of pneumococcal infections in those with two or more at -risk conditions may be as high as the risk for those with a recognised high -risk condition.82, 83, 84 Recommendations PCV13 and 23PPV are recommended but not funded for the following individuals: immune -competent adults (aged 18 years and older) at increased risk of pneu mococcal disease or its complications because of chronic illness (eg, chronic heart, renal, liver or pulmonary disease, diabetes or alcohol dependency) adults with cerebrospinal fluid leak immunocompromised adults at increased risk of pneumococcal disease ( eg, those with nephrotic syndrome, multiple myeloma, lymphoma and Hodgkin 's disease) individuals of any age who have had one episode of IPD smokers. 388 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 For those individuals who choose to purchase PCV13 and 23PPV vaccines, providers may follow the age -approp riate schedules in Table 16.4 and Table 16.5. Adults aged 65 years and older with no other risk factors Give one dose of PCV13 followed at least eight weeks later with 23PPV (not funded). 16.5.5 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Pneumococcal vaccin es are not routinely recommended for pregnant women. Women of childbearing age who are eligible for funded PCV13 and 23PPV should be vaccinated before a planned pregnancy or as soon as possible after delivery (see Table 16.5). Administration of these vaccines in pregnancy is unlikely to result in serious adverse effects and may be considered in individuals at the very high risk of IPD who were not vaccinated prior to pr egnancy.85 PCV13 and 23PPV may be given to breastfeeding women.85 16.6 Contraindications and precautions See section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for vacc polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines apart from a severe reaction to a previous dose or known hypersensitivity to any components of either vaccine. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 389 16.6.2 Precautions Systemic reacti ons (chills, rash and myalgia) may occur when PCV13 and influenza vaccine are administered at the same time. PCV13 has been associated with a slightly higher risk of fever over 39\u00b0C and febrile convulsions when co -administered with inactivated influenza va ccine in infants and young children, compared to when administered separately.86 Febrile convulsion history is not a contraindication to PCV13 immunisation. If indicated, PCV13 and influenza vaccines may be given to a child ag ed under 5 years at the same visit.85 Parents/guardians should be informed of the small risk of febrile convulsions, and separation of vaccines by two days can be offered. If the child has a history of febrile convulsions, separation of the vaccines is recommended. 23PPV should not be given to children aged under 2 years due to the reduced immune response associated with polysaccharide vaccines (see section 1.4.3). 16.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 16.7.1 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have excellent safety profiles. A 2016 systematic review foun d that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are considered safe for use in children, and serious adverse events are detected very rarely by post -marketing surveillance.87 PCV10 Pooled evaluation of data derived from several clinical trials found PCV10 to be very well tolerated and safe with a similar safety pro file to other PCVs.87 After primary immunisation of infants, mild to moderate irritability and injection -site redness were most commonly reported, occurring after 55 percent and 41 percent of all doses, respectively. Fever occurred in 30 -35 percent of children, regardless of the dose. Injection -site pain increased with age, reported by more than 39 percent of younger children and 58 percent of the older subjects. Severe adverse events were exceptionally rare. When PCV10 was co -administered with DTa P-containing vaccines, fever of 38\u00b0C or higher was reported after about one -third of primary or booster vaccine doses.88 These are similar results to those seen following co-administration of PCV7 and DTaP -containing vaccines.88 390 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 PCV13 The most commonly reported adverse reactions are injection -site reactions, fever, irritability, decrease d appetite and increased or decreased sleep.89 An increase in injection -site reactions was reported in children older than 12 months compared to rates observed in infants during the primary series with PCV13. No serious adverse events have been identified in adults or children, associated with underlying disease or immunocompromise.90, 91, 92 16.7.2 Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Local discomfort, erythema and induration lasting a couple of days are potential responses.93 Local and systemic reactions, such as self -limiting mild fever, myal gia and decreased arm movement in injected limb, may occur after revaccination of adults, particularly when the second dose is given within five years of the first dose.85 16.8 Public he alth measures IPD is a notifiable condition, and if confirmed, the laboratory undertaking the testing must notify the local medical officer of health. Local public health action is not expected in response to individual notifications of this disease. Pass ive surveillance for IPD and pneumococcal serotypes help to inform the immunisation schedule. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated for close contacts of cases of IPD. For those at high risk of pneumococcal disease where response to vaccination may b e poor, antimicrobial prophylaxis may be indicated. Discuss with an appropriate specialist. For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Invasive pneumococcal disease ' chapter of the Communicable Disease the vaccine data sheets The PCV10 (Synflorix) vaccine data sheet recommends that infa nts and children who receive a first dose of PCV10 complete the full vaccination course with PCV10. The Ministry of Health recommends that those who started with PCV10 may complete with PCV13 if they are subsequently diagnosed with a PCV13 -eligible conditi on (see section 16.5). The PCV13 (Prevenar 13) data sheet states that there is no data on the interchangeability of PCV13 with other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing a protein carrier different from CRM197. The Ministry of Health recommends that those who started with PCV13 may complete with PCV10 (see section 16.5). The 23PPV (Pneumovax 23) data sheet states that 23PPV and the herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) should not be given concurrently. The Ministry of Health recommends that 23PPV and the herpes zoster vaccine may be given concurrently (see section 23.4.4 ).80, 81 References 1. American Academy of Pediatrics. 2018.

Incubation p eriod Paralytic disease usually 7 -14 days, with a reported range of 3 -35 days. Period of communicability Most infectious in the days immediately before and after the onset of any symptoms. Transmission is possible for as long as the virus is shed (can be years in immunocompromised individuals).

Precautions and special considerations Non-immune pregnant women may be immunised if they are travelling to a region where polio is endemic. Public health measures All suspected cases of poliomyelitis be notied immediately on suspicion . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 399 17.1 Virology Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly transmissible infectious disease caused by poliovirus, a small, non -enveloped enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. There are three serotypes of poliovirus (types 1, 2 and 3). Wild types 2 and 3 have now been eradicated, but vaccine -derived poliovirus continue to circulate in some countries. 17.2 Clinical features Poliovirus is transmitted by the faecal -oral route or by ingestion of pharyngeal secretions. The incubation period for poliomyelitis is commonly 7 -14 days for paralytic disease, with a reported range of 3 -35 days. The risk of transmission of infection is greatest shortly before to shortly after the onset of symptoms. The virus persists in the pharynx for approximately one week, and in the faeces for three to six weeks or longer, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, where cases have been reported shedding for many years. The virus is highly neurotropic and its primary effect occurs in the neurones of the spinal anterior horn or the motor ganglia of the brain stem. in Up to 95 percent of infections are clinically inapparent; clinical cases range in severity from a non -paralytic fever to viral meningitis and acute flaccid paralysis. Symptoms include fever; headache; gastrointestinal disturbances; malaise; stiffness of the neck and back; and pain in the limbs, back and neck, with or without paralysis. In children who develop paralysis, the illne ss may be biphasic with the initial phase of one to three days ' duration being indistinguishable from that of other viral infections. The patient appears to recover, only to be struck down abruptly two to five days later with meningism, followed by paralys is. In adults and adolescents, the illness usually presents with a gradual onset of paralysis and pain without the early symptoms. Infected asymptomatic people will shed the virus in their stool and may spread the infection to others. Infection rates may be as high as 100 percent in households where there are non -immune young children. Paralysis may occur in 0.1 -2 percent of infected individuals. It is more common in adults, occurring in up to 1 in 75 cases of infection. Case fatalities from paralytic polio vary from 2 -5 percent among children and up to 15 -30 percent for adults, increasing to 25 -75 percent with bulbar involvement. Post-polio syndrome may occur some 30 -40 years after poliomyelitis. The cause is unknown but is probably related to the ag eing or death of nerves and muscles that were compensating for the original damage. Patients experience muscle pain and exacerbation of existing muscle weakness. The risk of developing post -polio syndrome is greater in women than in men, and the risk incre ases with time from the episode of acute polio. 400 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 17.3 Epidemiology 17.3.1 Global burden of disease In the pre -vaccination era, cases of poliomyelitis occurred sporadically with epidemics in high -income countries in temperate zones. In tropical countries, where the viru s still circulates, there is no seasonal pattern. Classically, poliomyelitis is a disease of young children and adolescents. In countries where polio was endemic, most children acquired antibodies to all three subtypes by age 5 years and most paralytic di sease occurred in children aged under 3 years. However, with improvements in living standards a greater number of cases have occurred at an older age, particularly in early adult life, with an associated higher frequency of paralytic disease. In the 30 ye ars since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative began, an estimated 18 million cases of paralytic poliomyelitis have been prevented, and out of 125 countries, two have ongoing transmission of wild -type 1 disease (Afghanistan and Pakistan).1 No wild -type disease has been detected in Nigeria since 2016, and the WHO hopes to decl are Africa wild poliovirus free in 2020.2 Although wild -type 2 and 3 polio have been eradicated, there was a dramatic increase in polio cases during 2019, primarily d ue to outbreaks in Pakistan which spread across its borders to Afghanistan and Iran.1 Disruption of immunisation programmes and poor sanitary conditions has enabled polio to spread, and in some countries, there are pockets of children unable to be accessed for vaccination due to conflict. The risk of international spread of pol iovirus was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in May 2014. Further to wild -type 1 disease, the incidence of circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus types (cVDPV) within under - vaccinated populations is of significant internationa l concern, particularly in Africa and South -East Asia (China, Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia).3 For up -to-date surveillance information and countries at risk of potential international spread of polioviruses, see the 'Polio Now ' section of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website ( polioeradication.org/polio -today/polio -now). There was a synchronised global switch to bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) in 20 16 in countries with circulating polio once the wild -type 2 disease was declared eradicated. In these countries, OPV is used together with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Many countries without circulating virus have discontinued OPV and provide only IPV to eliminate the risk vaccine -associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). However, shortages of IPV supply led to delays in this switch and mixed schedules have continued. A revised Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2019 -2023 has been develope d by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.4 Its goal is 'the complete eradication and containme nt of all polioviruses '. Vaccination will continue worldwide until all polio has been eradicated.1 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 401 17.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Since 1962 only six polio cases have been reported. Four of these cases were laboratory confirmed as VAPP and two were classified as probable VAPP.5 The last case of VAPP was reported in 1999.6 No cases have been reported since IPV replaced OPV in 2002. The New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit carries out active surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). In 2019 there were nine notifications: all were reviewed by the New Zealand National Certification Committee for the Eradication of Polio and all were classified as non -polio (ESR, 8 June 2020). The risk of importing wild -type or neurovirulent oral vaccine -derived (cVDPV) strains means that maintaining high IPV coverage in New Zealand is essential. For further details, refer to the ESR annual notifiable disease reports (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/IPD.php ). 17.4 Vaccines New Zealand switched from OPV to IPV in 2002 (see Appendix 1 ). 17.4.1 Available vaccines Funded polio vaccines The polio -containing vaccines funded as part of the Schedule are: (Infanrix -hexa, GSK): hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (see section 6.4.1 for DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV, GSK): diphtheria, acellular pertussis 6.4.1 for more inf (IPOL, Sanofi): contains three strains of poliovirus (40D antigen units of the Mahoney, 8D antigen units of the MEF -1 and 32D antigen units of the Saukett strains), inactivated by formaldehyde and containing phenoxyethanol as a preservative; trace amounts of neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B, polysorbate 402 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK Adacel Polio (Sanofi) is a Tdap -IPV vaccines registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) in New Zealand. 17.4.2 Efcacy and ef fectiveness See also section 15.4.2 about DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. Immunogenicity and efficacy IPV induces good systemic immune responses to prot ect against paralytic polio, but does not induce adequate intestinal neutralising antibody to interrupt faecal -oral transmission in regions with circulating polioviruses and with poor sanitation.7 Virtually all infants (99 -100 percent ) will seroconvert against all three strains after three doses of IPV vaccine, and more than 95 percent will seroconvert after two doses.8 The efcacy of IPV is greater than 90 percent and immunity is expected to be long lasting.9 Although antibody may decline over time in some individuals, there is no evidence that this leads to increased susceptibility to poliomyelitis.10 The combined IPV -containing vaccines induce immune responses against polioviruses superior to IPV stand -alone vaccines. This is due to the effect of the aluminium adjuvant present in these combination vaccines.9 Although immunocompetent adults previously immunised with OPV are expected to have lifelong pr otection against paralytic disease,10 a study in Australia found that adolescents and young adults who were primed only with OPV had lower levels of serum neutralising antibody than the younger cohorts who had received OPV and at least one dose of IPV.11 This data suggests that immunity provided by OPV primary schedule can be boosted by IPV to maintain individual immunity. 17.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) Do not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine should be stored in the dark. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 403 DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (I nfanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the supplied container of the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the vial containing the Hib pellet. After adding the vaccine to the pellet, the mixture should be shaken until the pellet is complet ely dissolved. Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kept for up to eight hours at 21\u00b0C. 17.4.4 Dosage and administration The administered by intramuscular injection (see section 2.2.3). The dose of IPV (IPOL) is 0.5 mL, administered by intramuscular injection or subcutaneo us injection, if indicated (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and IPV may be given at the same time as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, at separate sites and in separate syringes. 17.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Table 17.1: Immunisation schedule for IPV -containing vaccines (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 4 years DTaP -IPV Booster 17.5.1 Usual childhood schedule A primary course of poliomyelitis vaccine is given as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, followed by a booster dose given as DTaP -IPV at age 4 years (see Table 17.1). 404 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 17.5.2 Unimmunised adults and children For partially immunised or previously unimmunised individuals, a primary immunisation course consists of three doses of IPV -containing vaccine (funded). The recommended interval is eight weeks between doses, but the minimum interval can be as shor t as four weeks for catch -up of children or adults (see Appendix 2 ).12 If a course of vaccine is interrupted, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses. A booster may be given if 10 years have elapsed since the last dose and exposure is possible (eg, in the case of a traveller to an area where the virus circulates; this is not funded). If a child who began a course of OPV in another country moves to New Zealand, they can switch to IPV to complete the nal doses. A further dose of IPV should be administered even if they have completed a full OPV (OPV or bOPV) course. Note: All immunocompromised individuals and their household contacts may receive IPV. OPV was contraindicated in the immunocompromised because of the risk of VAPP. There is no risk of VAPP with IPV. 17.5.3 Pregnancy and breastf eeding No adverse effects on the fetus have been reported following administration of IPV during pregnancy, but immunisation should not be carried out during the rst or second trimester unless there are compelling reasons to do so, such as planned travel to an endemic area. However, bear in mind that pregnant women are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio. If a previously unvaccinated pregnant woman is travelling to a country where polio is occurring, two doses should be administered four weeks apa rt prior to departure. If departure cannot be delayed allowing a four-week gap, give two doses at the maximum possible interval, though protection cannot be guaranteed. If the available interval is less than two weeks, a single dose is recommended, with fu rther doses given on arrival where possible. IPV may be given to breastfeeding women. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 405 17.5.4 (Re)vaccination Polio -containing vaccines are funded for (re)vaccination of eligible patients, as follows. See also sections 4.2 and 4.3. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) and DTaP -IPV doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for (re)vaccination of patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for children requiring solid organ transplantation. IPV (IPOL) IPV is funded for patients foll owing immunosuppression. 17.5.5 Recommendations for other groups Booster doses of IPV are recommended (but not funded) for: all travellers to areas or countries where poliomyelitis remains endemic or with cVDPV (see section 17.3.1 ), who should receive a pre -travel polio booster - Under the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding polio, proof of polio vaccination is required on departure from certain countries. See Global Polio Eradication Initiative website for the current country list: polioeradication.org/polio -today/polio -now/public -health -emergency - status - Evidence of polio vaccination (a booster dose of IPV given 4 weeks to 12 months prior to exit from these countries) must be recorded on an International Certificate of Vaccination and Prophylaxis (ICVP). - An adult polio booster is recommended also f or those travelling to countries that have cVDPV -2 only.1 health care work ers in direct contact with a case of poliomyelitis individuals at particular risk of exposure (eg, laboratory workers routinely handling faecal specimens from persons recently arriving from high -risk countries, which may contain wild or vaccine -derived pol ioviruses); a booster dose of IPV is recommended every 10 years. 406 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 All the above should have completed a primary course of polio vaccines. Where there is uncertainty about previous immunisation, a full course of IPV is recommended (see Appendix 2 ). There is no evidence for the need for routine boosters, but they are recommended to reduce any possible risk from waning immunity in situations of incre ased risk of exposure. 17.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 17.6.1 Contraindications IPV-containing vaccines are contraindicated if there is a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose or to any of the vaccine components. See also section 15.6 for information about DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. 17.6.2 Precautions Pregnancy is a precaution for IPV -containing vaccination, but may be given to women who clearly need it. See section 17.5.3 . 17.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See also section 15.7 for information about DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and DTaP -IPV vaccines. 17.7.1 Potential responses A small proportion of individuals experience mild local symptoms following IPV. Injection -site erythema is seen in 1 -2 percent of infants, induration in 3 -11 percent and pain in 14 -29 percent . Similar local reactions are seen with combination vaccines.9 There is no poliovirus excretion following IPV. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 407 17.7.2 AEFIs Serious adverse events are very rare following administration of the IPV currently manufactured.8 See section 15.6 for information about DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib vaccine. 17.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all suspected cases of poliomyelitis be notied immediately on s uspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. Collect two faecal specimens 24 hours apart, 0 -14 days after the onset of paralysis and send to the national poliovirus reference laboratory at ESR . Contact the polio reference laboratory for specific advic e on the specimens required, and on packing and transporting the specimens (see also the 'Single human source specimen form ', available on the ESR website: www.esr.cri.nz/our - services/testing/test -request -forms/ ). All cases acute flaccid paralysis must be investigated as suspected poliomyelitis. All clinicians caring for any person aged under 15 years with AFP must notify the case to the local medical officer of health and report the case to the New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit. If in a hospital, all cases of AFP should also be discussed with a local microbiologist and infection control service. Case investigation and surveillance for AFP will continue in New Ze aland to monitor the successful eradication of polio.13 The New Zealand Paediatric Surveillance Unit is based at the University of Otago and is responsible for sending case investigation and follow -up forms to clinicians to continue to monitor that New Zealand has eradicated polio and to provide information to the WHO. Any case of poliomyelitis in New Zealand constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and the Director of Public Health at the Ministry of Health should be contacted urgently. The National Poliomyelitis Response Plan for New Zealand (Updated 2019) outlines the actual response and is published on the Ministry of Health website ( www.health.govt.nz ).13 Although wild -type polio has been eradicated in the WHO Western Pacic Region, circulating vaccine -derived poliovirus has been notified within the region (Indonesia, Philippines, China). New Zealand continues to need high levels of IPV coverage because of the small risk that polio may be imported from regions where poliovirus remains in circulation (see section 17.3.1 ). For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Poliomyelitis ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Variations from the vaccine data sheets See section 15.9 for variations from the DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) The IPV (IPOL) data sheet recommends three doses of vaccine administered at eight - week intervals.15 The Ministry of Health recommends that this schedule may be shortened to four-week intervals for catch -up (see Appendix 2 ).

Period of communicability During symptoms and until approximately 8 days after onset of symptoms. Up to 30 days after onset of symptoms in immunocompromised patients . Burden of disease All children during infancy or early childhood. Severe disease occurs most often in children age d 3 months to 2 years. Funded vaccine Oral live attenuated monovalent rotavirus: RV1 (Rotarix) . Dose, presentation, route 1.5 mL per dose. Oral suspension in an oral applicator , Administered orally. Funded vaccine indications and schedule 2 doses for infants, at ages 6 weeks and 3 months. For catch -up schedules, the first dose should be given before age 15 weeks (latest is 14 weeks and 6 days), and the 2nd dose should be given before age 25 weeks (latest is 24 weeks and 6 days). Vaccine eff ectiveness Highly effective against severe rotavirus diarrhoea; some evidence for efficacy against all -cause diarrhoea and herd protection . Contraindications Previous intussusception and with conditions that predispose the infant to intussusception. Severe combined immune deficiency. Precautions and special considerations Infants living in households with immunocompromised persons or pregnant women should still be vaccinated. Hand washing and the careful disposal of soiled nappies ar e likely to minimise any risk of vaccine transmission to household contacts. Immunosuppressed infants including those on immunosuppressive therapy (other than SCID, where it is contraindicated). Infants born to mothers on immunosuppressive biologic agents (see section 18.6.2 ). Potential responses to vaccine A possible, very small risk for intussusception; the benefits of immunisation considerably outweigh this poten tial risk. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 411 18.1 Virology The rotaviruses are segmented, double -stranded RNA viruses of the family Reoviridae.1 They are classified according to two surface proteins on the outer capsid: VP4 tein, which allows a binary classification system. The G and P proteins are immunological targets for neutralising antibodies protecting against disease and re -infection.2 While more than 60 G and P combinations have been found in humans, there are only five strains (P[8]G1, P[4] G2, P[8]G3, P[8]G4, and P[8]G9) that are associated with 80 -90 percent of the global burden of disease in children.3 For simplicity, these strains are commonly referred to by their G serotype as G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9. 18.2 Clinical features Rotavirus infects almost all children during infancy or early childhood. Transmission occurs through the faecal -oral route through close personal contact and through fomites. Aerosol transmission has been hypothesised but remains unproven.1 The incubation period is one to three days, after which illness can begin abruptly, with fever and vomiting often preceding the onset of diarrhoea.1, 4 Up to one -third of children will develop a fever of greater than 39\u00b0C.5, 6 The illness lasts from three to eight days. Children with rotavirus are infectious while they have symptoms and until approximately eight days after the onset of sym ptoms. Immunocompromised patients may be infectious for up to 30 days after the onset of symptoms.7 Large quantities of rotavirus are shed in the stool, and only a few virions are required to cause infection in a susceptible host.8 Rotavirus infection in the first three months of life is frequent ly mild or asymptomatic. This is possibly due to passive protection from maternally acquired antibodies, being breastfed and the intestinal cell structure of newborn infants.1, 9 The burden of severe dehydrating gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus occurs predominantly in infants and children aged 3 months to 2 years .3 The clinical spectrum ranges fr om asymptomatic infection to an acute severe illness with frequent and large -volume diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration, electrolyte disturbance and their sequelae. The illness spectrum from rotavirus is more severe than from other common causes of diarrhoea in children.1 412 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 18.3 Epidemiology 18.3.1 Global burden of disease Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a signicant cause of infant diarrhoea worldwide, both in high- and low -income countries. Virtually all children are infected by age 5 years.1 Each year rotavirus causes the death of approximately 200,000 to 450,000 children aged under 5 years worldwide10, 11 and results in 2.4 million paediatric hospital admissions.12 Virtually all of the deaths occur in low -income countries. Prior to the introduction of licensed rotavirus vaccines in high -income countries, more than 220,000 children were hospitalised with rotavirus gastroenteritis every year.13, 14 Rates of rotavirus illness i n children before the introduction of vaccine were similar in high- and low -income countries, indicating that good hygiene and clean water supplies are unlikely to have a significant impact on disease prevention. As a result, immunisation is the primary pu blic health measure for the reduction of rotavirus disease burden.1 In countries with a temperate climate, rotavirus epidemics occur every winter and spring. Factors associated with an increased risk of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis include age under 2 years, low birthweight, premature gestation, lack of breastfeeding, socioeconomic disadvantage, malnutrition and impaired immunity.1, 15, 16, 17, 18 Rotavirus gastroenteritis is not, however, more severe in HIV -infected children, although viral shedding may be longer.3 Rotavirus is an important cause of hospital -acquired infection19 and can also cause disease in adults, especially those caring for children20 and those living in aged -care facilities. During outbreaks in early childhood settin gs, rotavirus has been isolated from telephone receivers, drinking fountains, water -play tables and toilet handles.21 Outbreaks in elderly populations may be linked to waning immunity, institutional crowding or both. Children and adults can be infected with rotavirus several times in their lives. After a single natural infection during infancy, approximately one -third are protected against subsequent rotavirus infection, more than three -quarters are protected against subsequent rotavirus gastroenteritis and 85 -90 percent are protected against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis.22 The proportion with protection against both infection and symptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis increases with successive episodes.22 These observations serve as the biological basis for rotavirus vaccines, whereby live attenuated strains can induce cumulative protective immunity similar to that following natural infection by wild -type rotaviruses. Although the immune mechanism and correlates of protection against rotavirus infection are incompletely understood, it is likely that both mucosal and serum antibodies are associated with protection against rotavirus infection and disease.23 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 413 Since the introduction of the vaccine in other high -income countries, there have been reductions in all -cause and rotavirus gastroenteritis in age groups not eligible for the vaccine, suggesting herd immunity effects as a result of rotavirus vaccines3, 24, 25 (see 'Herd immunity in the post -licensure period ' in section 18.4.2 ). 18.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in July 2014, as a three -dose schedule to infants at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, using the RV5 vaccine (RotaTeq) (see Appendix 1 ). At present rotavirus is not a notifiable disease, so there is no national surveillance data available. National hospital discharge rates, community and hospital laboratory data plus a sentin el hospital -based surveillance system have been used to monitor rotavirus disease since vaccine introduction. The sentinel hospital -based rotavirus surveillance was introduced in December 2014 at Kidz First Children 's Hospital in Counties Manukau DHB and e xtended to Wellington, Hutt and Christchurch Hospitals in April 2016. For detailed information about rotavirus surveillance and rotavirus infections in New Zealand, see the ESR website ( https://surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/Rotavirus.php ). Pre-vaccine epidemiology Prior to the introduction of vaccine, by the age of 5 years, it is estimated 1 in 5 children had sought medical advice for rotavirus gastroenteritis and 1 in 43 children had been hospitalised.13 From 2010 to 2014, the average annual national hospitalisation rate for rotavirus in children aged under 5 years was 215.4 per 100,000.26 The highest hospitalisation rates for children aged under 5 ye ars were in those from the Middle Eastern/Latin American/African ethnic group, followed by Pacific and Mori ethnic groups. Hospitalisation rates in children aged under 5 years who reside in the most deprived NZDep2013 quintiles (quintiles 4 and 5) were si gnificantly higher than those who reside in the least deprived quintile. There is a seasonal peak for rotavirus hospitalisations, usually occurring around September each year. Post-vaccine epidemiology The introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Australi a resulted in a 70 percent decrease in rotavirus hospitalisations in the two and a half years post -vaccine introduction.27 A similar decline has been noted in New Zealand in the first year post -vaccine introduction, where rotavirus hospitalisation rates for children aged under 5 years declined by 85 percent in 2015 compared with the previous five -year average (2010 -2014)26 (Figure 18.1). The vaccine has been effecti ve in decreasing the most severe rotavirus disease. Hospitalisation rates decreased for all ethnic groups and levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Community laboratory data also supports the large decrease in rotavirus infections in the community. 414 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Although only children aged under 1 year were eligible for rotavirus vaccination, hospital discharge rates decreased in all children aged under 5 years in 201526 (Figure 18.2). Older children are more likely to have been exposed to rotavirus already, and are less likely to benefit from vaccination. Hospital discharges for rotavirus ranged from 510 to 822 cases per year in the four years prior to vaccine introduction (2010 -2013).26 There were 99 hospital discharges for rotavirus in children aged under 5 years in New Zealand in 2015, compared with 770 in 2014. This reduction in rotavirus hospitalisations of children aged under 5 years was maintained to 2019, with 80 cases hos pitalised in the year to June 2019. There was a 93.6 percent decrease in rotavirus outbreaks ( three outbreaks reported in 2015 compared with 47 in 2014) after the introduction of vaccine in New Zealand.26 This demonstrates that universal rotavirus vaccination is an effective public health intervention.

Two rotavirus vaccines have been used in New Zealand. Both are orally administered live attenuated vaccines and have been extensively evaluated.28, 29 The live attenuated vaccine viruses replicate in the intestinal mucosa and are shed in the stools of vaccine recipients.28, 30, 31 Funded vaccine RV1 (Rotarix, GSK) is a live attenuated monovalent human rotavirus vaccine. It include G2P[4], G3P[8], G8P[4], G9P[8] and G12P[6]) on the basis of other shared epitopes. Each 1.5 mL dose contains: at least 106 CCID50 (cell culture infective dose 50 percent ) of the RIX 4414 strain of human rotavirus other components and residuals, including sucrose, disodium adipate and culture medium. 416 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 18.4.2 Efficacy and effectiveness Prevention of disease A 2012 Cochrane review32 of the efficacy of rotavirus vaccines for the prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea assessed 41 trials which met the inclusion criteria, involving 186 ,263 enrolled participants. Of these, 29 trials assessed the monovalent vaccine (RV1; Rotarix) and 12 trials assessed the pentavalent vaccine (RV5; RotaTeq). For the first two years of life in countries with low mortality rates, both vaccines prevented ov er 80 percent of cases of severe rotavirus diarrhoea ( Table 18.1). Both vaccines impact severe all -cause diarrhoea (moderate to low quality of evidence). See also Figure 18.1 and Figure 18.2 above, which show a reduction in rotavirus hospitalisations in New Zeala nd children aged under 5 years after rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2014.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 417 Effectiveness In pre-marketing clinical trials, rotavirus vaccination prevented 42-58 percent of all- cause hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis, suggesting it is responsible for more gastroenteritis than is detected by routine testing.28, 33, 34 Post-licensure survei llance studies have demonstrated large reductions in rotavirus - positive stool isolates from children with gastroenteritis (US)35 in diarrhoea -related deaths (Mexico).36, 37 Summarised, post -licensure vaccine effectiveness studies in high - income countries have shown an 89 -100 percent reduction in emergency department visits or hospitalisation; a 74 -90 percent decline in hospitalisations for rotavirus gastroente ritis in children aged under 2 years; and a 29 -50 percent decline in 'all-cause ' acute gastroenteritis hospitalisations for children aged under 5 years.38 A protective association between rotavirus vaccine and childhood seizures has been reported in the US39 and Australia.40 In US children, a full course of rotavirus vaccination was associated with an 18 -21 percent reduction in the risk of seizure requiring hospitalisation or emergency department ca re in the year following vaccination, compared with unvaccinated children.39 In the Austral ian state of Queensland, rotavirus vaccine was 35.8 percent effective at preventing emergency department presentation for febrile seizures and 38.0 percent effective at preventing subsequent hospitalisation in children up to two years following vaccination .40 Herd immunity in the post -licensure period Since the beginning of the post -licensure period, over 80 countries have introduced the rotavirus vaccine into their national immunisation programmes.41 There has been substantial though somewhat variable efficacy data to show a decline in rotavirus infections in the different country environments. In the US, ther e was a 73 percent reduction in rotavirus infections among infants from 2003 to 2014.42 The effectiveness tends to wane with age, and rotavirus 'seasons ' appear to be longer in the post - licensure period.42 While a decline has occurred in rotavirus infection alone, there has also been a reduction in all -cause diarrhoeal illnesses.41 Furthermore, the protective effect of the vaccine has surpassed the expected level of vaccine efficacy and coverage, resulting in a herd protection. Therefore, the immunised proportion of the population is causing a reduction of infection in the unimmunised portion of the community.43 418 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Duration of protection Prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in Europe, extension studies of the pivotal phase III RV5 trial showed protection lasting up to three years from the last vaccine dose.44 The duration of protection provided by rotavirus vac cines is difficult to measure because of the herd immunity effect that occurs after the vaccine is implemented. Some studies indicate waning immunity after the first year of life, particularly in low -income countries.45, 46 In a large multicentre study in the US, both RV1 and RV5 vaccines were found to provide lasting and broadly heterologous protection against infection. Vaccine effectiveness persisted to the seventh year of life for RV5 and throu gh the third year of life for RV1.47 Note that the differences in duration are because RV1 was licensed in the US approximately two years later than RV5, affecting vaccination coverage and corresponding study power for older age groups for RV1 analyses.47 Partial vaccination Studies in partially vaccinated infants ( ie, those who had not completed the three -dose course of RV5 or the two-dose course of RV1) found that protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis ranged from 51 -55 percent in low - and middle -income countries, and from 69 -93 percent in high -income countries.48 Cross -protection Rotavirus vaccine strains vary consi derably, and multiple wild -type strains can occur at the same time. In high -income countries, both vaccines appear to provide some cross - protection against non -vaccine serotypes.49, 50 Vaccine protection against newly emerging genotypes is not well known, and national surveillance of circulating rotavirus types post -vaccination is necessary.51 18.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immun isation Providers 2017 (2nd +2\u00b0C +8\u00b0C. Do not freeze. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 419 18.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of RV1 (Rotarix) is 1.5 mL, administered orally (for administration instructions see section A7.2.4 of this Handbook or the vaccine data sheet, available at www.medsafe.govt.nz ). Do not inject RV1. Two doses are given, at ages 6 weeks and 3 months. See section 18.5 below for more information. Co-administration with other vaccines Rotavirus vaccines can be administered at the same time as other schedu led vaccines. Note that no time interval is required between administration of rotavirus and BCG vaccines; the two live vaccines likely to be administered to infants aged under 6 months. If the dose is regurgitated or vomited If the dose of rotavirus vaccine is regurgitated or vomited during or after administration, a repeat dose should not be given .52 The second dose should be administered as per the schedule. Receptor binding of vaccine is instantaneous, making repeat dosing unnecessary. If the first dose is immediately spat out then a single repeat dose could be give n. 18.5 Recommended immunisation schedule RV1 is recommended and funded for all infants. See section 18.5.2 for RV1 age limit information. Immunisation is especially encouraged for those who will be attending early childhood education services or where there is an immunocompromised individual living in the household. Infants who have already had rotavirus gastroenteritis should still receive the full course of immunisation. Initial rotavirus infection only provides partial protection against subsequent infection.1, 22 420 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 18.5.1 Routine schedule Two RV1 doses are given orally, at ages 6 weeks and 3 months. Table 18.2: The infant RV1 (Rotarix) schedule Dose Usual scheduled age Recommended age limits for dosing Dose 1 6 weeks 6-14 weeksa Dose 2b 3 months 10-24 weeksc a. The upper age limit for receipt of the first dose of RV1 is immediately prior to turning 15 weeks old (14 weeks and 6 days). b. The minimum interval between doses 1 and 2 is 4 weeks. c. The upper age limit for receipt of the second dose of RV1 is immediately prior to turning 25 weeks old (24 weeks and 6 days). 18.5.2 Catch -up schedules The first dose of RV1 should be given before age 15 weeks ( ie, 14 weeks and 6 days), and the second dose administered at lea st four weeks later (see Table 18.2). An infant who has not had the first dose before age 15 weeks will not be able to commence the rotavirus course. Where the first do se is inadvertently given at age 15 weeks or older, the second dose should be given , but both doses should be given before age 25 weeks (ie, the latest is 24 weeks and 6 days).1 Rotavirus vaccine is not intended for use in older children, adolescents or adults. The age limits for initiating and completing the vaccine series are recommended because there is insufficient safety data on the use of these vaccines outside this age range. If a partially vaccinated infant reaches age 25 weeks before the second dose is given , the first dose already given will offer th em partial protection against disease. The severity of rotavirus infection decreases with age, so a cost -benefit analysis for vaccinating older children is a low priority and has not been done. 18.5.3 Preterm infants Vaccination as per the Schedule ( ie, at the usual chronological age, with the usual vaccine dosage and interval) is recommended for preterm infants and infants with low birthweight, including those still in hospital (see below). Rotavirus vaccine can be given to preterm infants born who are receivin g corticosteroids. (See also 4.2.1 for more 421 18.5.4 Hospitalised infants Rotavirus vaccine should be given on time to any infant admitted to a general hospital ward (where other patients are not high risk). If standard infection control precautions are maintained , there is no risk of transmission of vaccine strain rotavirus whe n rotavirus vaccine is administered to hospitalised infants, including hospitalised preterm infants and those in neonatal units.53, 54 (See also section 4.2 for more information about infants with special immunisation recommendations.) 18.5.5 Pregnancy and breastfeeding There is no concern caused by vaccine ex posure during pregnancy. There is no restriction for breastfeeding before or after vaccination of the infant (see 'Shedding ' in section 18.6.2 ). 18.6 Contraindications a nd precautions See section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 18.6.1 Contraindications Rotavirus vaccine should not be given to infants with: a history of a severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a vaccine component a history of intussusception or an uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose the infant to intussusceptions (see section 18.7.1 ). severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).55 18.6.2 Precautions Rotavirus vaccine can be administered to infants with a mild illness, incl uding gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infections. Infants with moderate to severe gastroenteritis should not be vaccinated until symptoms resolve. 422 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 There is very little safety data on infants with predisposing conditions such as metabolic disor ders and chronic (Hirschsprung 's, malabsorption syndromes or short gut syndromes). Since there is a greater risk of serious wild-type rotavirus disease, the benefits outweigh the risk, and vaccination is encouraged.52 Infants who have received antibody -containing blood products and are the appropriate age should be vaccina ted. Rotavirus vaccine and antibody -containing blood products can be administered simultaneously.52 There is a theoretical risk of interference in the immune response to the vaccine; therefore the interval between vaccination and receipt of blood products should ideally be as long as possible within the age limits of the vaccine schedule. Administr ation of RV1 in immunosuppressed infants, including infants on immunosuppressive therapy, should be based on careful consideration of potential benefits and risks. Infants born to mothers on immunosuppressive therapies There is limited data on rotavirus vaccination safety when given to infants born to mothers receiving immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy.19, 36, 56 Although in most cases it is likely to be safe, cauti on is required. The level of circulating wild -type rotavirus is currently very low in New Zealand; therefore, the risk of gastroenteritis following rotavirus vaccination in this cohort of infants may be greater than the risk of acquiring the disease. The d ecision to administer rotavirus vaccine to infants born to mothers who received immunosuppressive agents (biologic agents) during pregnancy should be determined case by case. If an infant turns 15 weeks of age before the first rotavirus vaccine dose can b e administered, they will not be able to receive any rotavirus vaccine doses. See section 4.3.7 and Table 4.2 for a list of the highly immunosuppressive medications with long half -lives that require a prolonged delay before vaccination (for up to one year in those being treated). These include monoclonal antibody (mab) agents that readily cross the placenta . Each case should be assessed on a risk -benefit basis and with specialist advice. Shedding Since rotavirus vaccine virus replicates in the gastrointestinal tract, it can be shed in stools - especially after the first dose.57 Shedding is also more likely in immunocompromised patients (eg, children with HIV). The vaccine virus could then be transmitted to unvaccinated pop ulations; a feature that is generally beneficial as it promotes herd immunity. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 423 Infants living in households with immunocompromised individuals should be vaccinated. So far there are no safety concerns, but there is also no data to confirm the safety of th ese vaccines for immunocompromised patients. Infants living in households with pregnant women should also be vaccinated. Hand washing and the careful disposal of soiled nappies are likely to minimise any risk of vaccine transmission to household contacts.52, 53 18.7 Potential responses and AEFIs The 2012 Cochrane review32 described in section 18.4.2 also reviewed the safe ty of RV1 and RV5 vaccines. No significant difference was found between children receiving RV1 or RV5 and placebo in the number of serious adverse events, particularly intussusception (see below). No statistical differences were observed for fever, diarrhoea and vomiting between cases and placebo groups. There was no significant difference between cases and placebos in the number of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the schedule. In 2010 porcine circovirus or porcine circoviru s DNA was detected in both rotavirus vaccines. However, there is no evidence that this virus is a safety risk or causes illness in humans.52 18.7.1 Intussusception Intussusception is a cause of an acute abdomen when one part of the intestine telescopes into another part of the intestine; the mechanism by which these events occur remains uncertain. In 1999 an oral human -rhesus rotavirus quadrivalent vaccine (RotaShield) was licensed in the US and on the infant schedule but was withdrawn later that year after reports of an association with intussusception (a risk of approximately one case in 5,000 -10,000 vac cine recipients). No increased risk of intussusception was detected in the large phase III pre -licensure clinical trials of RV1 (Rotarix) and RV5 (RotaTeq), despite this being a specifically monitored adverse event. However, post -marketing surveillance of both rotavirus vaccines indicates the possibility of an increased risk of intussusception shortly after the first dose of rotavirus vaccination. Evidence from Australia58 indicates that after the first dose, RV1 had a relative incidence (relative risk) of 6.8 (95% CI: 2.4 -19.0, p<0.001) and 3.5 (95% p=0.01) for the periods of 1 -7 days and 8 -21 days after vaccination, respect ively. For RV5, the relative incidence was 9.9 (95% and 6.3 (95% CI: for the same time periods. 424 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 There was also some elevated risk of intussusception 1 to 7 days after the second dose of both vaccines. The relative incidence for RV1 was 2.8 (95% CI: 1.1 -7.3, CI: 1.2 -6.8, p=0.02). There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception following a third dose of RV5.58 The increased risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination is estimated at approximately 6 additional cases of intussusception among every 100,000 infants vaccinated (approximately 1 in 15,500 vaccine recipientss ), or 14 additional cases per year in Australia.58 Studies in the post -licensure period continue to show small increases in risk for both RV1 and RV5 and primarily within seven days of the first dose of vaccine.59, 60 Recent safety data has continued to emphasise the clear and dramatic benefit of vaccination over the very low risk of vaccine -associated intussusception.41 For example, a self - controlled case -series study estimated that the RV1 programme in England caused 21 intussusception admissions annually and prevented 25,000 gastrointestinal infection admission s with a clear risk -benefit ratio.61 While there appears to be an increased relative risk of intussusception, the condition remains rare, and this risk is outweighed by the benefits of rotavirus vaccination in preventing rotavirus infections; there was a n estimated 70 percent reduction in hospitalisations in young children after the vaccine 's introduction to the Australian schedule.62 It is uncertain whether rotavirus vaccine administration affects the overall incidence of intussusception: US data suggests no increased overall rate in in fants despite a small cluster effect.63 Both the WHO64 and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation62 continue to recommend the use of rotavirus vaccine for infants. Although the risk of intussusception after rotavirus immunisation is very small, it is recommended that parents seek medical advice and health care professionals are attentive if the baby develops intermittent crying or screaming episodes, pulling their knees towards their chest and vomiting, or pink - or red -coloured jelly -like stools. A recent study has described the epidemio logy of intussusception in New Zealand children aged 0 -36 months (794 cases) for a 16 -year period before the introduction of routine rotavirus vaccination.65 This study will provide a valuable baseline to determine if the introduction of the vaccine has significant effects on intussusception rates in the New Zealand population. 18.8 Public health measures Prevention of spread is by contact precautions, including careful handwashing . In an early childhood service setting where there has been a child known to have had a rotavirus infection, the surfaces should be washed with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and w ater. Disinfectants inactivate rotavirus and may help to prevent disease transmission resulting from contact with environmental surfaces.52 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 425 For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Acute gastroenteritis ' chapter of the Communicable at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual -2012). 18.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet The RV1 (Rotarix) vaccine data sheet states that if an infant vomits or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit. The Ministry of Health does not recommend repeating the dose (see section 18.4.4 ).52 The RV1 data sheet recommends postponing the administration of the vaccine in infants suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. The Ministry of Health recommends vaccinating infants with mild gastroenteritis, and to wait until symptoms have resolved for infants with moderate to severe gastroenteritis (see section 18.6.2 ). The RV1 data sheet states that the vaccine should not be administered to subjects with any chronic gastrointestinal disease. The Ministry of Health recommends instead that pre-existing chronic gastrointestinal disease is not a contraindication to rotavirus vaccination, with the exception of those conditions that may predispose the infant to intussusceptions (see sections 18.6.1 and 18.7.1 ).53 References 1.

Infant s with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) shed rubella virus in their pharyngeal secretions and urine. Incubation period 14-23 days, usually 16 -18 days. Up to 50 percent of rubella infections are subclinical. Period of communicability 7 days before until 7 days after the onset of the rash. Infants with CRS may be infectious for months. Incidence and burden of disease Endemic rubella was verified as eliminated in 2017. One imported case of rubella was notified in 2018. Cases continue in other regions , including China. Funded vaccine MMR is a live attenuated vaccine. Dose, presentation, route 0.5 mL per dose after reconstitution. Pre-filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Funded vaccine indications and schedule Children at ages 12 months and 15 months. Adults who are susceptible to one or more of measles, mumps and rubella. For (re)vaccination following immunosuppression, if the individual is immuno competent enough to safely receive the vaccine. Recommended All adults born since January 1969 should be up to date with two doses of MMR or have evidence of immunity to all three vaccine components . It is particularly important for health care workers, i ndividuals who work with children, armed forces personnel, staff of correctional facilities, long -term care facilities and immigration/refugee centres and laboratory staff. All vaccine -eligible travellers, particularly to high -risk countries. Vaccine effi cacy/ effectiveness Highly effective, 2 doses are anticipated to provide lifelong protection. Protection is best achieved through herd immunity from high immunisation coverage. Contraindication MMR is contraindicated for those with anaphylaxis to neomycin, immunocompromise and in pregnancy. See section 12.6 for cautions around receipt of blood products and other live vaccines, and other precautions. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 431 Precautions and special considerations All pregnant women and women planning pregnancy should have their immunisation history checked. A woman is immune to rubella if she has had two documented doses of a rubell a-containing vaccine given at least 4 weeks apart and given after age 12 months, regardless of serology. Pregnant non -immune women should avoid contact with known cases of rubella and should receive MMR after delivery. Potential response to vaccine MMR is generally well tolerated. Temporary joint pain 2 -4 weeks after vaccination due to rubella component of the vaccine is more common in adults than children. See section 12.7. Alert parents of possible febrile seizure risk, particularly for t hose with a history of seizure. Public health measures All suspected cases must be notied immediately on suspicion . 19.1 Virology Rubella is an enveloped RNA virus from the family Togaviridae and the genus Rubivirus . It is less stable than measles virus and can be inactivated by solvents, trypsin, formalin, extremes of heat and pH, and light.1 19.2 Clinical features The purpose of the rubella immunisation programme is to prevent congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella infection during pregnancy can result in fetal infection, causing CRS in a high proportion of cases. Rubella infection in the rst 12 weeks of pregnancy results in fetal damage in up to 85 percent of infants, and multiple defects are common. The risk of damage declines to 50 percent by about 16 weeks ' gestation and 25 percent by the end of the second trimester.2 Fetal abnormalities are rare from infection in the third trimester of pregnancy. Infants born with CRS may have cataracts, nerve deafness, cardiac malformations, microcephaly, mental re tardation and behavioural problems. Inflammatory changes may also be found in the liver, lungs and bone marrow. Some infected infants may appear normal at birth, but have nerve deafness, oesophageal and eye defects, and diabetes detected later.3 CRS is one of the few known causes of autism.2 432 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Clinical features of rubella in children and adults include a transient erythematous rash and lymphadenopathy without respiratory symptoms. Arthritis or arthralgia is r elatively common and a classic feature of infection in adults. While usually a mild childhood illness, rubella may also present as a more severe illness, clinically indistinguishable from measles. Encephalitis occurs with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 6,000 cases and may result in residual neurological damage or, occasionally, death. Thrombocytopenia rarely occurs. Clinical diagnosis is unreliable because the symptoms are often fleeting and can be mimicked by other viruses. In particular, the rash is not diagnostic of rubella. Up to 50 percent of rubella infections are subclinical or asymptomatic. Asymptomatic cases are also able to transmit the virus. A history of rubella should therefore never be accepted as proof of immunity without laboratory conr mation.3 Transmission of rubella is through direct or indirect contact w ith infected nasopharyngeal secretions and droplets. The incubation period is usually 16 -18 days (range 14 -23 days) and infectivity is between seven days before and seven days after the onset of the rash. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) shed rubella virus in their pharyngeal secretions and urine for months after birth and should be considered infectious until they are aged 12 months. Although the vaccine virus is excreted after vaccination, mostly from the pharynx, transmission to susceptibl e contacts has not been demonstrated (see section 12.7.2 ). Therefore, a recently immunised contact is not a risk to a pregnant woman. The frequency of complications and consequences of rubella infection are best described from the 1963/1964 US outbreak, involving 12.5 million cases of rubella and 30,000 infants damaged by intrauterine rubella, an incidence rate of 1 per 100 pregnancies (see Table 19.1).

Philadelphia, US: Elsevier. Table 53.7. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 433 Rubella infection can occur (very rarely) in individuals with either naturally acquired or vaccine -induced antibody.3 Rare cases of CRS have been reported after reinfection during pregnancy.3 As with measles, public health measures of accurately diagnosing potent ial cases of rubella with notification and contact tracing are critical (see section 19.8). 19.3 Epidemiology 19.3.1 Global burden of disease Humans are the only source of rub ella infection. Infection is often asymptomatic. In the pre-vaccine era the highest incidence of clinical cases occurred in the spring among 5-9-year-old children, and 80 -90 percent of adults were immune to rubella. Extensive outbreaks of rubella occurred every six to nine years, in which many children were affected by CRS. Immunisation against rubella, introduced to prevent the occurrence of CRS, has resulted in a very signicant reduction in infection, especially once vaccination was introduced to boys an d girls. The Global Vaccine Action Plan set a specific target to eliminate measles and rubella by 2020 and to reduce the incidence of CRS from 100,000 cases per year. The number of notified rubella cases fell from over 670,000 in 2000 to just over 22,000 in 2016. However, from January to September 2019, nearly 40,000 cases were reported: 92 percent of those cases were in China and 7 percent in Japan.4 Although rubella elimination has been verified in 81 countries, less than 70 percent of infants across 168 countries worldwide were immunised against rubella by the end of 2018.5 19.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Rubella immunisation was introduced in 1970 (see Appendix 1 ), and rubella has been a notiable disease since 1996. The last large rubella outbreak in 1995 -1996 mostly involved young adult males, who would not have been offered immunisation. This emphas ises the need to immunise both boys and girls to reduce the risk of exposure in pregnant women, as well as to reduce illness in men. Two cases of rubella were notified in 2019, in a male and a female both aged 30 -39 years. Rubella was verified as elimina ted from New Zealand in October 2017. There have been no reported cases of CRS in New Zealand since 1998. For further information, see the ESR 's notifiable disease reports (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). 434 HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 19.1: Rubella year, Source: ESR 19.4 Vaccines 19.4.1 Available vaccines Rubella vaccine is one of the components of the live attenuated MMR vaccine (see section 12.4.1 ) (and also MMRV vaccine mentioned in section 22.4.1 ). Funded vaccine MMR funded as part of the Schedule is Priorix (GSK), which contains attenuated Jeryl Lynn (See section 12.4.1 for more information.) Other vaccines MMR II (MSD) was the funded vaccine prior to the 1 July 2017 Schedule change (see section 12.4.1 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 435 19.4.2 Efcacy and effectiveness The rubella vaccine has been shown to be 90 -97 percent effective in an outbreak after a single dose, and this is likely to be higher with a two -dose schedule. One dose of rubella vaccine at 12 months or older induces an antibody response in at least 95 percent of recipients. Studies have found no evidence of waning of protection over decades of follow -up.3 In more than 90 percent of recipients, antibodies persisted for at least 16 years; other studies have reported persistence up to 21 years.3 A few recipients fail to produce antibodies following immunisation, and a small number of individuals lose antibodies, whether they are derived from natural infection or the vaccine. As pa rt of a follow -up of those who received MMR in Finland, it was shown that while antibodies wane over time, immunity to rubella remained secure 20 years after the second dose of MMR.6 19.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd editio Do freeze. MMR must be reconstituted only with the diluents supplied by the manufacturer. Use MMR as soon as possible after reconstitution. If storage is necessary, reconstituted vaccine can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0 C for up to eight hours. 19.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of MMR is all of the reconstituted vaccine (approximately 0.5 mL) administered by intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection if indicated (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines MMR can be given concurrently with other vaccines, as long as separate syringes are used and the injections are given at different sites. If not given concurrently, live vaccines should be given at least four weeks apart. (See also section 2.2.7 for information about multiple injections at the same visit.) Interchangeability The two brands of MMR (Priorix and MMR II) may be used interchangeably for completion of a c ourse.1 436 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 19.5 Recommended immunisation schedule To prevent all cases of CRS, rubella must not circulate in the community. Achieving at least 95 percent coverage of two doses of MMR prevents the circulation of rubella (which is much less infectious than measles). As in other high -income countries , New Zealand 's primary strategy for preventing and maintaining elimination of rubella is to vaccinate both boys and girls ( Table 19.2). Historically, a targeted individual protection approach was used in which only 11 -year- old girls were immunised with one dose of rubella vaccine. Even with high coverage, there remained wom en of childbearing age who were susceptible to rubella due to failure to be vaccinated or vaccine failure and cases of CRS continued to occur albeit at a reduced rate. Rubella remained in circulation in New Zealand because children aged under 11 years and males were not vaccinated. Table 19.2: Recommended MMR vaccination schedule Schedule Usual childhood schedulea 2 doses: at ages 12 months and 15 months Catch -upb for children adolescents and adults 2 doses: at least 4 weeks apart a. If MMR is given to children aged 6 -12 months for outbreak control, 2 further MMR doses are still required at ages 12 months (at least 4 weeks after previous dose) and 15 months. b. MMR is funded for those who are susceptible to 1 or more of the 3 diseases. See sections 19.5.2 and 19.5.3 . 19.5.1 Usual childhood schedule Two doses of rubella vaccine as MMR are recommended at age 12 months and 15 months. Over 95 percent of individuals will become immune to rubella after one dose.2 The second dose is not a booster. Two doses are recommended because n early all the 2 -5 percent not protected by the rst dose will be protected by the second. The second dose of vaccine can be given as soon as four weeks after the rst dose. (See below for the recommendations for other groups.) Children who receive MMR vac cination during an outbreak (of measles, mumps or rubella) when aged under 12 months require two further doses administered at age 12 months and 15 months. No opportunity should be missed to achieve immunity, if not contraindicated. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 437 19.5.2 Catch -up Any individua l born on or after 1 January 1969 (see section 12.5.2 ) who does not have two documented doses of MMR, given at least four weeks apart with the first dose given any time after age 12 months, should be offered either one or two doses ( four weeks apart) to bring them up to two doses (funded). Even if the individual has previously received single -antigen measles vaccine, up to two doses of MMR (ie, additional doses of m easles vaccine) may be given to these individuals to ensure rubella and mumps protection. There are no significant adverse effects from further vaccinating individuals who are already immune to measles, mumps and/or rubella, and no reliance can be placed o n a prior clinical history of rubella infection. Immigrants to New Zealand The vaccination status of immigrants should be checked as a priority group: particularly, those born overseas (especially in Asia, the Pacific Islands, sub -Saharan Africa and South America) who entered New Zealand after the age of routine vaccination. Anyone who does not have two documented doses of MMR, given any time after age 12 months, should be offered either one or two doses ( four weeks apart) to bring them up to two doses (funded if eligible). Some countries provide a rubella -containing vaccine before the age of 12 months; these children may require extra MMR doses to be fully immunised. Occupational risk Visitors to countries wi th circulating rubella virus, including those travelling for work or humanitarian purposes, are at highest risk of importing disease. It is recommended to be fully immunised prior to departure from New Zealand. During an outbreak, health care workers and t hose working with infants in day care facilities are at high risk of transmitting disease to pregnant women and their infants. MMR is funded for all New Zealand residents born since 1 January 1969 if they have not previously had two documented doses of MMR . 19.5.3 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Women planning pregnancy It is particularly important to ensure that women of child -bearing age are immune to rubella.1 Women who are planning pregnancy should have their immunisation history checked for having received two documented doses of a rubella -conta ining vaccine given at least four weeks apart and given after age 12 months. Non -immune women may receive MMR before pregnancy, but pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after the last MMR vaccination.7, 8 438 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 As seen with recent measles and mumps outbreaks, community immunity in the 15 -29 years age group is low due to historically poor MMR vaccination coverage during the 1990s and early 2000s; there is a cohort of women of child -bearing age potentially susceptible to rubella. Pregnant women MMR is contraindicated during pregnancy. All pregnant women should have their immunisation history checked. A pregnant woman is considered immune to rubella if she has had two documented doses of a rubella -containing vaccine gi ven at least four weeks apart and given after age 12 months, regardless of serology . As soon as possible following delivery, as appropriate, give one or two doses of MMR four weeks apart to women who are not immune (funded). Serological testing for immuni ty to rubella is not usually performed in New Zealand except as part of routine antenatal care. Improved documentation and effective surveillance showing the rarity of CRS when there is high immunisation coverage has led to some countries, such as England, discontinuing routine antenatal rubella screening.9 Also, the screening tests used for rubella serology can potentially give inaccurate results and may cause unnecessary stress for women.9 In general, it should be remembered that the great majority of New Zealand -born individuals who received all scheduled childhood vaccines will be immune to rubella. Although the chance of being exposed in New Zealand to an infectious case is becoming increasingly rare, rubella remains endemic in some countries, and the risk remains to those who are unimmunised when travelling overseas or through an imported case. (If exposure during pregnancy does occur, see the guidelines in section 19.8.3 .) After delivery If MMR and Rhesus anti -D IG are required after delivery, both the vaccine and anti -D IG may be given at the same time, in separate sites with separate syrin ges. The vaccine may be given at any time after the delivery. Anti -D IG does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine, but whole blood transfusion does inhibit the response in up to 50 percent of vaccine recipients (see section A6.4.1 ). Breastfeeding There is no risk to the mother or child in giving MMR to breastfeeding in immunocompromised children (s ee section 4.3). They can be partially protected from exposure to infection by ensuring that all contacts are fully immunised, including hospital staff and family me mbers. There is no risk of transmission of MMR vaccine viruses from a vaccine recipient to the immunocompromised individual. See section 12.7.2 . MMR is funded for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression. However, it is important to be sure that the individual is immunocompetent enough to safely receive the vaccine. HIV infection Discuss vaccination of individuals with HIV infection with their specialists (see 'HIV infection ' in section 4.3.3). MMR is recommended for all HIV -positive children, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, if their CD4+ lymphocyte percentage is 15 percent or greater. It is recommended that asymptomatic children who are not severely immunocompromised receive MMR from age 12 months to provide early protection against the three diseases. Susceptible HIV -positive children and adults aged 14 years and older may receive MMR if the CD4+ lymphocyte count is 200 cells/mm3 or greater. Administration of MMR with CD4+ counts below these recommended levels has been associated with vaccine -related pneumonitis (from the measles component).7 19.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general vaccine contraindications. 19.6.1 Contraindications See section 12.6.1 for specific MMR contraindications. The general contraindications that apply to all immunisations are relevant to MMR. Anaphylaxis to a previous dose of MMR or any of the vaccine compo nents (including neomycin) is a contraindication to a further dose of MMR. 440 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 MMR should not be given to women who are pregnant, and pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks after immunisation.2, 3 However, inadvertent immunisation with a rubella -containing vaccine in early pregnancy is no longer con sidered an indication for termination of pregnancy. There have been no cases of teratogenic damage from vaccine virus despite intensive surveillance in the US, the UK and Germany.3 19.6.2 Precautions Egg allergy, including anaphylaxis, is not a contraindication for MMR. See section 12.6.3 for more information, and section 12.6.2 for further precautions. 19.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See also section 12.7. 19.7.1 Potential responses A fever of 39.4\u00b0C or more occurs in 5 -15 percent of children 6 to 12 days after immunisati on and generally lasts 1 to 2 days.7 A rash may also occur in approximately 5 percent of children at the same interval post -vaccination: these children are not infectious to others, unless the rash is caused by a different concurrent illness.7 The majority of these events are coincidental and not caused by the vaccine.10 Serological tests or PCR can be expected to be positive if performed during this time, so testing should not be routinely performed. Joint symptoms may be reported in 0.5 percent of young children and 10 -25 percent of post -pubertal women.2 Symptoms begin one to three weeks after immunisation and are usually transient. The prevalence of joint symptoms following rubella immunis ation is lower than occurs with natural infection at a corresponding age.2 It was previously thought that the rubella vaccine might lead to long -term arthritis. A 2012 Institute of Medicine review concluded that the evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between MMR and chronic arthritis in women.11 19.7.2 AEFIs ITP and, rarely, neurological disturbances have been reported (see section 12.7.2 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 441 19.8 Public health measures Rubella (including CRS) is a notifiable disease, and suspected cases should be notified by the clinician on suspicion to the local medical officer of health. Accurate diagnosis requi res laboratory confirmation. The preferred method of diagnosis is by PCR or culture; see the 'Rubella ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Manual (available at health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual ). Serology may be useful but can be hard to interpret if the person has received rubella vaccine in the past. The local medical officer of health will arrange contact tracing and alert the contacts or the public of potential exposure, particularly of pregnant women. 19.8.1 Exclusion of cases of rubella infection Parents/guardians should be advised that children w ith suspected rubella should be excluded from early childhood services or school until fully recovered and for seven days after the appearance of the rash. Children with CRS should be considered infectious until they are aged 12 months. Adults should be ex cluded from work until fully recovered and for seven days after the appearance of the rash. 19.8.2 Management of non -pregnant contacts The local medical officer of health will advise on contact management. Check the immunisation status of all close contacts. Rubella -containing vaccine does not provide protection if given after exposure to rubella. However, if the exposure did not result in infection, the vaccine would induce protection against subsequent infection. Human normal immunoglobulin does n ot prevent rubella infection after exposure and should not be used for that purpose.12 19.8.3 Management of pregnant contacts It is critical to accurately document the rubella status of all people who may have rubella and potentially exposed a pregnant woman to the virus. Such people will have travelled overseas or had contact with an infected returned traveller. As described in section 19.3.2 , rubella virus does not circulate in New Zealand. Rubella infection in the first half of pregnancy is potentially devastating, and every possible exposure of a pregnant woman should be discussed with the local medical officer of health, obstetrician and microbiologist or infectious diseases physician. 442 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Pregnant contacts with confirmed immunity can be reassured that the likelihood of rubella infection is remote.13 This applies if: she has received at least two documented doses of rubella -containing vaccine, or a previous antibody screening test has detected a protective level of antibodies, and this has been documented, or one dose of vaccine followed by a rubella antibody screening test showing a protective level of antibodies has been documented.13 Coord inated care and management Coordinated care and management are essential ( Table 19.3). An obstetrician (or a maternal fetal medicine specialist) and an infectious dise ases specialist/microbiologist should be consulted when the diagnosis of possible rubella infection in a pregnant woman is rst considered. The clinical picture and all test results should be discussed by all involved in the care of the woman, to enable an accurate interpretation of the serological results before advising the woman about the risk to her fetus and options regarding the continuation of pregnancy. Pregnant women whose immunity to rubella has not been conrmed for the current pregnancy, and wh o have been exposed to rubella in the first half of pregnancy , must be investigated serologically irrespective of immunisation history or history of previous clinical rubella. Serum should be obtained as soon as possible, with the clinical details included on the request form. The laboratory should be asked to store an aliquot of serum for later testing in tandem with a follow -up sample. These results must be interpreted in conjunction with the time since exposure, to determine whether acute infection has o ccurred. It is essential to discuss testing with the local clinical microbiologist before taking samples, to ensure that the right samples are obtained, and the best tests performed expeditiously. All requests to laboratories must state the: duration of p regnancy and last menstrual period date of exposure to possible rubella date of blood specimen name of the index case who is thought to have rubella. The use of IG is not recommended for post -exposure prophylaxis of rubella in early pregnancy or any other circumstance. However, IG may be considered if termination of the pregnancy is not an option, but termination must be discussed when maternal infection is confirmed. Although IG has been shown to reduce clinically apparent infection in the mother, there i s no guarantee that fetal infection will be prevented. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 443 It is a legal requirement that all cases of CRS and rubella be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical ofcer of health. For more details on control measures, refer to the 'Rubella ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www. health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual ).

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 445 20 Tetanus Key information Mode of transmission Environmental exposure to the bacillus, usually through contaminated wounds. The disease is not directly transmitted from person to person. Incubation period Between 3 and 21 days, commonly about 10 days; may vary from 1 day to several months. Period of communicability A person with tetanus is not infectious to others. Incidence and burden of disease Older individuals, usually women, who are less likely to have received a primary series of tetanus vaccine; and in unvaccinated children per dose. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib: pre -filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. DTaP -IPV, Tdap: pre -filled syringe. Funded vaccine indications and schedule During each pregnancy (recommended from 16 weeks ' gestation) for pertussis protection Tdap 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib 4 years DTaP -IPV 11 years Tdap 45 years (catch -up, if individual has not received 4 previous tetanus doses) Tdap 65 years Tdap Parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to neonatal intensive or specialist baby care units for more than 3 days and whose mothers had not received Tdap at least 14 days prior to birth for pertussis protection Tdap For vaccination of previously unimmunised or partially -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV or Tdap For (re)vaccination of eligible patients For boosting of patients with tetanus -prone wounds Tdap Post-exposure prophylaxis If an injury is tetanus prone and there is any doubt about previous tetanus immunisation, the individual must be given tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) and a 3 -dose primary immunisation ). 446 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 20.1 Bacteriology Tetanus is caused by the action of tetanus toxin released by Clostridium tetani , a spore - forming gram -positive, motile, anaerobic bacillus. The most common source of environmental exposure to C. tetani spores and bacilli is soil. However, soil is not the only reservoir of the organism. Animals, both herbivores and omnivores, can carr y C. tetani bacilli and spores in their intestines, and the organism is readily disseminated in their faeces. Once introduced into the relatively anaerobic conditions found in wound tissue, they germinate and produce toxin. Tetanus spores or bacilli can e asily be introduced into a wound at the time of injury, even when the injury is quite trivial. Contaminated wounds, especially wounds with devitalised tissue and deep -puncture trauma, are at greatest risk. 20.2 Clinical features The clinical diagnosis of tetan us is characterised by muscular rigidity and very painful contraction spasms. When severe, it is associated with a characteristic facial grimace (risus sardonicus) and arching of the back (opisthotonus). The patient suffering from tetanus remains alert unl ess they become severely hypoxic. The C. tetani toxin reaches the central nervous system via the axons and irreversibly binds to nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction, blocking the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters and leading to the tetanic muscle spasms. The incubation period is between 3 and 21 days, commonly about 10 days, but it has been reported to vary from one day to several months. The bacteria need an anaerobic environment in which to grow, and this is often found in damaged and ne crotic tissue, although the inoculation site may appear insignificant. Initial symptoms include weakness, stiffness or cramps, and difculty chewing or swallowing food. Reflex muscle spasms usually occur within one to four days of the initial symptoms, the interval being called the onset period. The shorter the incubation and onset periods, the more severe the disease. Even with modern intensive care, tetanus mortality is about 10 percent overall, and much higher in older people. Neonatal tetanus, from infection of the umbilical stump, is the commonest form of the disease in some low -income countries, particularly where births take place at home without adequate sterile procedures and antenatal screening and immunisation programmes are disrupted.1 A person with tetanus is not infectious to others, and vaccination provides individual protection only, with no herd immunity. Protective immunity can only be conferred by vaccination with tetanus toxoid and not through exposure to the natural pathogen or suffering tetanus. See section 20.5.2 . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 447 20.3 Epidemiology 20.3.1 Global burden of disease Tetanus infection continues to occur globally but is rare in high income countries. The estimated total number of tetanus cases (including neonatal cases) globally fell from more than 110,000 in 1980 to 15,000 in 2018.2 The highest numbers of cases were in India, Uganda and other sub -Saharan African countries.2 Tetanus in males in some sub-Saharan countries has been associated with voluntary circumcision aimed at reducing the risk of HIV infection.3 There were 1,803 neonatal tetanus cases reported worldwide in 2018, two -thirds of which were in Africa, and all the cases of tetanus reported in Afghanistan, Chad and Yemen were neonatal.4 Maternal and neonatal tetanus is described as a silent killer, since many cases are unreported.5 Worldwide, all countries are committed to 'elimination ' of maternal and neonatal tetanus; that is, a reduction of neonatal tetanus incidence to below one case per 1,000 live births per year in every distr ict.1 However, this goal has not yet been reached in 14 countries. The incidence of tetanus reflects the effectiveness of the local immunisation programme, with low inci dence in regions with high immunisation coverage. Global immunisation coverage for DTP is around 86 percent and 129 countries have reached at least 90 percent coverage for three doses of the DTP vaccine. In 2018, an estimated 19.4 million children aged und er 1 year did not receive DTP. Of these, 13.5 million lack access to vaccination service and live in the poorest most fragile or conflicted states, and 60 percent live in 10 countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Philippines, Brazil, Ang ola and Vietnam.6 20.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology No cases of tetanus were notified during 2017 -2019. There were 33 tetanus cases notified between 1997 and 2017.7 There were four cases in unvaccinated children (aged under 10 years), 14 cases in unvaccinated adults and three cases in vaccinated adults (the time since vaccination is not known). Two females aged 70 years or older died (one was not vaccinated and the vaccination status of the other was unknown).8 For further information, see to the ESR's notifiable disease reports (available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/surveillance.php ). 448 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 20.4 Vaccines Tetanus immunisation protects by stimulating the production of antitoxin, provid ing immunity against the effects of the toxin. It does not prevent C. tetani growing in a contaminated wound. The tetanus vaccine is prepared from cell -free toxin treated with formaldehyde to produce a toxoid. The toxoid is adsorbed onto an aluminium salt adjuvant to improve immunogenicity. 20.4.1 Available vaccines Funded vaccines Tetanus vaccine as a single antigen is no longer available in New Zealand. It is only available in combination with other vaccines. The tetanus toxoid -containing vaccines funded as par t of the -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa, GSK): vaccine Tdap (Boostrix, GSK): a lower adult dose of diphtheria and pertussis vaccine, together with tetanus vaccine. See section 6.4.1 for more detailed vaccine information. Other vaccines Other tetanus toxoid -containing vaccines registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) New Zealand Efficacy and effectiveness Tetanus toxoid vaccine administered to pregnant women can prevent tetanus in their newborns (neonatal tetanus). Subsequent field assessments of the efficacy of two or more tetanus toxoid doses using data collected during neonatal tetanus mortality surveys demonstrated effectiveness of 70 -100 percent . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 449 A systematic review and meta -analysis concluded that immunisation of pregnant or childbearing -age women with two or more doses of tetanus toxoid reduces neonatal tetanus mortality by 94 percent (95% CI: 80 -98).9 Tetanus in adults is too rare for vaccine efcacy to be tested in a clinical trial. However, the effectiveness of tetanus v accine was clearly demonstrated in World War II, when only 12 cases of tetanus occurred among the 2.7 million wounded US army personnel (0.44 per 100,000), compared to 70 cases out of 520,000 wounded in World War I (13.4 per 100,000).9 Of the 12 cases, only four had completed primary immunisation. Immunised cases have less severe disease and a lower case -fatality. Duration of protection Serological studies show that the three -dose primary series of a tetanus vaccine given in infancy plus a booster during the second year of life, provide 3 -5 years of protection against tetanus. WHO recommends six doses of tetanus -containing vaccine before age 18 years to induce immunity that lasts for much of adulthood.1 It is recommended that adults receive at least one booster dose, particularly where fewer than six doses have been given in childhood. Over the last two decades, there has been a sign ificant increase in the proportion of the adult population with protective antitoxin levels by mid -life.10 One mathematical model estimated protection to last for at least 30 years in most adul ts after vaccination.11 But as age increases, by every 10 years there is an associated 50 percent reduction in antitoxin levels.12, 13 Even if documented as fully immunised, older adults are likely to have had fewer tetanus doses in their lifetime than adults younger than 30 years.14 Protection against the effects of tetan us toxin may be insufficient in adults who have not been adequately primed, and those aged over 65 years are at particularly increased risk of tetanus.10 A single dose of tetanus toxoid produc es a rapid anamnestic response.15, 16, 17, 18 To ensure that there is adequate antitoxin to neutralise tetanus toxin in the case of a tetanus -prone injury, a booster dose is advised if it has been longer than 10 years since the las t tetanus vaccine dose. The extent of wound contamination and delays in seeking medical assistance can result in high levels of tetanus toxin being released. (See also sections 6.4.2 and 15.4.2 .) 20.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) not freeze. DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib and Tdap should be stored in HANDBOOK 2020 DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) must be reconstituted by adding the entire contents of the supplied container of the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine to the vial containing the Hib pellet. After adding the vaccine to the pellet, the mixture should be shaken until the pellet is completely dissolved . Use the reconstituted vaccine as soon as possible. If storage is necessary, the reconstituted vaccine may be kept for up to eight hours at 21\u00b0C. 20.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV or Tdap is 0.5 intramus cular injection (see 2.2.3). -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and Tdap can be administered simultaneously (at separate site s) with other vaccines or IGs. 20.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Table 20.1: Immunisation schedule for tetanus -containing vaccines (excluding catch -up) Age Vaccine Comment Pregnant women: recommended from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester (funded when given any time in second or third trimester) Tdap Booster for mother Passive immunity for infant 6 weeks DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 3 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 5 months DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib Primary series 4 years DTaP -IPV Booster 11 years Tdap Booster 45 years (individuals who have not received 4 tetanus vaccinations in their lifetime) Tdap Booster 65 years Tdap Booster IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 451 20.5.1 Usual childhood schedule A primary course of tetanus vaccine is given as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa) at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, followed by a dose of DTaP -IPV (Infanrix -IPV) at age 4 years ( Table 20.1). A further booster is given at age 11 years (school year 7) as Tdap (Boostrix). If a course of immunisation is late or interrupted for any reason, it may be resumed without repeating prior doses (see Appendix 2 ). 20.5.2 Catch -up immunisation for indiv iduals aged 10 years and older For adults and children who present with a tetanus -prone wound, boosters are recommended in accordance with the guidelines in the following sections and Table 20.2. See Appendix 2 for detailed catch -up immunisation information. Tdap may be used for primary immunisation of children aged 7 to under 18 years. Tdap can be given for vaccination of previously unimmunised or partially immunised adult patients. Prior clinical tetanus does not usually confer immunity, and immunisation is required. In 1995, a 40 -year-old man developed tetanus for a second time because he failed to complete the recommended course of immunisation after the rst episode of tetanus.19 Dose intervals between Td and Tdap When Tdap is to be given to adolescents or adults, no minimum interval between Td and Tdap is required,20, 21, 22 unless Tdap is being given as part of a primary immunisation course. 20.5.3 Booster doses for adolescents and adults Adults are recommended to hav e their tetanus immunisation status assessed at ages 45 and 65 years, and given either a booster dose of tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine if more than 10 years has elapsed since the previous dose, or a primary course, if there is any doubt about the adequ acy of previous tetanus immunisation (uncertain or no history of a prior primary course). Protection against tetanus is expected to last at least 20 years following a booster dose after the primary series. 452 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Tdap is recommended and funded: as a booster dose to all adolescents at school year 7 or age 11 years as a single dose for vaccination o f individuals aged 65 years old as a single dose for catch -up vaccination of individuals aged 45 years old who have not had four previous tetanus doses. These age -specic recommendations may facilitate the linkage of adult immunisation to the delivery of other preventive health measures. Offer a booster dose of Tdap for someone travelling overseas if it has been more than 10 years since the last dose (unfu nded) (see section 6.5.3). The administration of tetanus and diphtheria (Tdap) boosters given at ages 45 and 65 years, is also funded. 20.5.4 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap in every pregnancy so that antibodies can pass to the fetus to provide pertussis protection from birth (funded when given any time in second or third trimester ). It is recommended to be given from 16 weeks ' gestation of every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester to protect both the mother and her infant from pertussis (see section 15.5.2 ).23 Tdap vaccine may also be given to pregnant women when catch -up is needed for an under -immunised woman, or for management of a tetanus -prone wound (see section 20.5.5 ).23, 24 Tdap can to breastfeeding women.24 (Re)vaccination Tetanus toxoid -containing vaccines are funded for (re)vaccination of eligible patients as follows, including prior to planned immunosuppression regimes or following immunosuppression. See also sections 4.2 and DTaP -IPV doses (as appropriate) of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged unde r 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for (re)vaccination of patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 453 Up to five doses of DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (for children aged under 10 years) or DTaP -IPV are funded for children requiring solid organ transplantation. Tdap (Boostrix) An additional four doses (as appropriate) of Tdap (Boostrix) are funded for patients: post-HSCT or chemotherapy pre- or post -splenectomy pre- or post -solid organ transplant undergoing renal dialysis prior to planned or following other severely immunosuppressive regimens. A single dose of Tdap is funded for parents or primary caregivers of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit or special care baby unit for more than three days and whose mothers had not received Tdap at least 14 days prior to baby 's birth. 20.5.6 Prevention of tetanus following injury Following injury, it is essential that all wounds be adequately cleaned and devitalised tissue removed to reduce the level of contamination and tetanus toxin release. Further treatment depends on the circumstances of each case. If the injury is considered to be tetanus -prone and there is any doubt about the adequacy of previous tetanus immunisation, the individual must have tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) and commence or complete the recommended primary course of three doses of a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine (depending on age and other antigens required: DTaP -containing vaccine or Tdap). The definition of a tetanus -prone injury is not straightforward, because tetanus can occur after apparently trivial injury, such as fr om a rose thorn, or with no history of injury. However, there are certain types of wounds likely to favour the growth of tetanus organisms. These include: compound fractures bite wounds deep, penetrating wounds wounds containing foreign bodies (especially wood splinters) wounds complicated by pyogenic (pus -forming) infections wounds with extensive tissue damage (eg, crush injuries, avulsions, contusions or burns) wounds associated with vascular insufficiency (eg , leg or foot ulcers in the elderly) any super ficial wound obviously contaminated with soil, dust or horse manure (especially if topical disinfection is delayed more than four hours) re-implantation of an avulsed tooth - in this case, minimal washing and cleaning of the tooth is conducted to increase the likelihood of successful re -implantation. 454 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 General measures for the treatment of tetanus -prone wounds Wounds or injuries should be classified as tetanus -prone or non -tetanus -prone as follows (see Table 20.2): non-tetanus -prone wounds - clean, minor wounds that are less than six hours old, non-penetrating and with negligible tissue damage tetanus -prone wounds - all wounds that may be contaminated or infected, and are penetrating, more than six hours old and with tissue damage. Immunised individuals respond rapidly to a booster injection of tetanus toxoid - containing vaccine, even after a prolonged interval. Tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine and TIG should be given at the same time, but into different limbs and using separate syringes. See also the IMAC factsheet Guidelines for the management of tetanus -prone wounds (available at www.immune.org.nz/res ources/written -resources ). Table 20.2: Guide to tetanus prophylaxis in wound management History of tetanus vaccinationa Time since last dose Type of wound Tdapb TIGc 3 doses <5 years Tetanus -prone wounds No No 3 doses >5 years Clean minor wounds No No 3 doses >5 years Tetanus -prone wounds Booster dosed No 3 doses >10 years Clean minor wounds Booster dosed No <3 doses or uncertain Clean minor wounds Complete the coursee No <3 doses or uncertain Tetanus -prone wounds Complete the coursee Yes a. People who have experienced Arthus -type hypersensitivity reactions (see 20.7.2 ) or temperature >39.4\u00b0C after a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid -containing preparation should not receive tetanus toxoid -containing preparation more frequently than every 10 years, even if t hey have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. b. See Appendix 2 for catch -up schedules for previously unimmunised children. DTaP -containing vaccine may be used in children aged under 10 years. c. TIG = tetanus immunoglobulin. The recommended dose is 250 IU given by IM injection as soon as practicable after injury. If more than 24 hours has elapsed, 500 IU is recommended. d. If appropriate, this may count as the b ooster dose at age 45 or 65 years . e. To complete the 3 -dose primary immunisation course, give 1 -3 doses at not less than 4 -weekly intervals. Tetanus immunoglobulin availability and storage Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is issued in ampoules, each containi ng of human tetanus antitoxin. (Ampoules of 2,000 IU are used for treatment and not for prophylaxis.) These should be protected from light and stored in a refrigerator at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. They must never be frozen. TIG is given intramuscularly. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 455 TIG do se The recommended dose to prevent tetanus is 250 IU of TIG for recent injuries, but this should be increased to 500 IU if more than 24 hours has elapsed since injury, or if there is a risk of heavy contamination or following burns. There is no need to test the patient 's sensitivity before administering TIG, but caution is necessary if the patient is known to suffer complete immunoglobulin A (IgA) deciency. In this situation, specialist help should be sought (see section 4.3). Patients with impaired immunity who suffer a tetanus -prone wound may have failed to respond to prior vaccination and may therefore require TIG. 20.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 20.6.1 Contraindications Immunisation with Tdap or another tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine should not be repeated in individuals who have had previo us severe hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine or a vaccine component. Most cases of hypersensitivity have been reported in individuals who have had an excessive number of booster injections outside the guidelines noted above. 20.6.2 Precautions Protection against the risk of tetanus is paramount if the wound is thought to be tetanus - prone. Immunisation should not be postponed because the patient has a minor infection. People who have experienced Arthus -type hypersensitivity reactions (see section 20.7.2 ) after a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid -containing preparation should not receive tetanus toxoid -containing preparation more frequently than every 10 years, even i f they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. Arthus -type reactions are rare in children and did not occur during the clinical trial of Tdap vaccines.25 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome within six weeks of a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine weeks is a precaution to receiving a further dose (see section 20.7.2 ).22 See section 15.6.2 for precautions to pertussis -containing vaccines, including DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib. 456 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 20.7 Potential responses and AEFIs See also sections 6.7 and 15.7 for potential responses and AEFIs to responses Tetanus toxoid combination vaccines have not been associated with any safety concerns. Sterile abscesses and persistent nodules at the injection site may develop if the injection is not given deeply enough into the muscle.26 Mild discomfort or pain at the injection site persisting for up to a few days is common.24 Tdap has a safety profile similar to Td and is generally well tolerated.27, 28 20.7.2 AEFIs The 1994 US Institute of Medicine review of adverse events from tetanus vaccine concluded that the evidence supported a link with brachial plexus neuropat hy (brachial neuritis) at a rate of 0.5 -1 per 100,000 doses within four weeks of immunisation.29 Occurrence of brachial neuritis following vaccination does not preclude the future use of a tetanus -toxoid containing vaccine in the same person.22 Severe local reactions (including large injection -site swelling, c alled Arthus reactions, which are presumed to be immune -complex mediated reactions) are hypersensitivity reactions that have been associated with older tetanus and diphtheria toxoid - containing vaccines. Historical data on multiple doses of Td and tetanus t oxoid vaccines indicate that hypersensitivity was associated with very high levels of pre-existing antibody.9, 30 No increased risk of GBS has been observed with use of tetanus toxoid -containing vaccines, and therefore a history of GBS is not a contraindication to receiving a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine. However, out of prudence, it is recommended that having GBS within six weeks of a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine is a precaution to receivin g a further dose.9, 30 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 457 20.8 Public health measures All cases of tetanus must be notied immediately on suspicion to the local medical officer of health, who should be provided with as accurate an immunisation history as possible. See section 20.5.6 'Prevention of tetanus following injury '. See also the 'Tetanus ' chapter of the Communicable Disease Control Manual (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual -2012 ). 20.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheets Tdap vaccine is not approved for use (registered ) for primary immunisation. However, adults aged over 18 years may receive Tdap (funded) for catch -up of the primary schedule (see Appendix 2 ). See section 15.9 for 1. World Hea lth Organization. 2017.

People with latent TB infection and non-pulmonary TB disease are not infectious. Incubation period Between 2 and 10 weeks from infection to primary lesion or significant tuberculin skin test (Mantoux) reaction. Period of communicability May be years with untreated pulmonary TB. See the Guidelines for Tuberculosis Control in New Zealand 2019 (or current edition) - see section 21.5.3 . Burden of disease Disseminated and meningeal TB are more common in very young children. The immunocompromised individuals, particularly HIV -infected, are more at risk of disease and complications. In New Zealand, TB incidence is highest in those born in high prevalence countries. Funded vaccine Bacillus Calmett e-Gu\u00e9rin ( BCG) Vaccine SSI. Dose, presentation and route Vaccine can only be administered intradermally by an authorised vaccinator with BCG endorsement. Live attenuated vaccine, which must be reconstituted. Funded vaccine indications and recommended sch edule Neonatal BCG vaccine should be offered to infants at increased risk of TB, as dened in section 21.5.2 . (See Appendix 8 for a list of countries with a TB rate 40 per 100,000. ) Contraindications Individuals with primary or secondary immunocompromise, including: receiving immunosuppressive treatment malignant lymphoma, leukaemia) HIV-positive or potentially individuals infants of mothers who received biologic immunosuppressive agents during pregnancy other individuals in whom immunocompromise is kno wn or suspected (see section 21.6.1 ). Individuals with generalised infected skin conditions. Potential responses A local reaction develops in 90 -95% of those vaccinated with BCG, which may scar within 3 months. A minor degree of adenitis is normal, not a complication. Suppurative adenitis may take months to resolve; usually no treatment is required. Public health measures All cases of active TB must be notied to the local medical ofcer of . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 461 21.1 Bacteriology Human TB infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mycobacterium bovis . 21.2 Clinical features M. tuberculosis or M. bovis infection most commonly causes disease in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected. The initial infection with M. tuberculosis usually goes unnoticed. Early infections can be cleared, progress rapidly to primary TB, or be contained in a latent phase (LTBI): see Figure 21.1. Primary TB occurs most commonly in young children aged under 5 years, individuals with immunocompromise and those infected by particul arly transmissible isolates of TB. Latent TB infection has no symptoms and is diagnosed by a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay after the exclusion of active TB. Latent infection progressing to active TB is also called reactiv ation TB. The lifetime risk for infected people progressing from this latent phase to active TB disease may be as high as 20 percent , but this risk is strongly affected by infecting dose, the age of the person, the presence of healed lesions on chest X -ray and immunocompromise.1, 2 The time from infection to clinical manifestations of primary TB varies, from one to six months after infection. Reactivation TB can occur at any time thereafter, even decades after infec tion. The most common site of infection is the lung (pulmonary TB), where TB infection classically causes an asymmetrical pulmonary infiltrate. The 'classic ' TB pathology of caseation, cavity formation and fibrosis occurs late and in a minority of cases. Y oung children with active TB disease may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of fever, lassitude and failure to thrive. Older children and adults with active TB disease may present with symptoms of anorexia, fatigue, weight loss, chills, night sweats, cough, haemoptysis and chest pain. Any organ can be affected by extrapulmonary TB, causing meningitis, pleurisy, pericarditis, bone or joint infection, renal infection, gastrointestinal tract infection, peritonitis or lymphadenitis, or disseminating via the bloodstream and affecting multiple organs (disseminated TB). Disseminated and meningeal TB are more common in very young children. Immunocompromise, like HIV, is associated with higher rates of disseminated TB and less specific clinical features.3 462 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Figure 21.1: Stages in the natural history of tuberculosis Key: TST = tuberculin skin test; IGRA = interferon gamma release assay; TB = tuberculosis. 21.3 Epidemiology 21.3.1 Global epidemiology Worldwide, the incidence rate of TB is slowly fall ing by about 1.5 percent per year, but TB remains a major global health problem. Much of the TB burden exists in 30 high - burden countries, spread mainly in poor, crowded and poorly ventilated settings. Globally, as of 2018, an estimated 1.7 billion people are infected with M. tuberculosis of which 5 -15 percent will develop active TB during their lifetime.4 WHO estimates there were 10.4 million new TB cases in 2016 and TB remained the top cause of infectious disease mortality with 1.7 million deat hs.4 Of those cases, an estimated 1.9 million cases were linked to undernourishment and 1 million to HIV, 0.8 million to smoking and 0.8 million to diabetes. There has been an increasing burden of multidrug -resistant TB (defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) with an estimated 600,000 new cases of multidrug -resistant TB in 2016.4 In low -burden countries, such as New Zealand, the peak age for TB is in older adults, reflecting their exposure to TB in the past when i ncidence was higher. In high -burden countries TB is most common in children and young adults. The risk of TB in people who emigrate from high -burden countries is proportionate to the incidence in their country of origin.5 21.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology For detailed TB information, see the Tuberculosis in New Zealand: Annual Report , available at surv.esr.cri.nz/surveillance/AnnualTBReports.php . Notification rates and risk factors TB remains one of the most common notiable infectious diseases in New Zealand. Cases of TB declined substantially between 1980 and 2007, but they have remained relatively stable since then.6 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 463 In 2019, there were 323 notifications f or TB (notification rate of 6.6 per 100,000; ESR, 8 June 2020 at a similar rate to 2018 (6.4 per 100,00).6, 7 Notification rates were highest in those aged 20 -29 years (12.2 per 100,000) and 30 -39 years (10.6 per 100,000), with slightly higher rates in males than females. Asian ethnic groups ha d the highest notification rate in 2019 (35.7 per 100,000, 206 cases), followed by Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (30.7 per 100,000, 17 cases) and Pacific peoples (15.5 per 100,000, 49 cases). Of the 306 new TB cases with risk factors recorded in 20 19, 251 were born overseas (ESR, 8 June 2020). The highest disease rate was among those born in Southern and Central Asia (129 per 100,000), followed by those born in South -East Asia (57 per 100,000), the Pacific Islands (23 per 100,000). The most reported country of birth in SE Asia was Philippines (64 percent ). The notification rate was considerably lower for Mori (3.8 per 100,000, 29 cases) and European/Other (0.6 per 100,000, 20 cases) groups (ESR, 8 June 2020). There is substantial regional variation in TB notification rates: the highest rates are in the Auckland and Wellington regions; this is associated with immigration. Of the 81 percent of cases in 2019 with date of arrival recorded, the median interval between arrival and the TB notification ran ged from 0 to 65 years (mean 8 years and median 5 years) (ESR, 8 June 2020) . One child under 5 years of age was notified with TB in 2019 (ESR, 8 June 2020). The child was born in New Zealand and not vaccinated. Multidrug -resistant TB Multidrug -resistant TB is rare but does occur in New Zealand. Over 10 years (2009 -2018), a total of 36 cases were multidrug resistant (annual average rate of 2 percent ).7 All these cases were born and assumed to have acquired the infection overseas; 83 perce nt were born in an Asian country. 21.4 Vaccine Note: Depending on world supply, BCG vaccine may not be available in New Zealand. BCG vaccine types vary widely, with different strains. The incidence of side -effects with BCG vaccination differs between strains that are considered more reactogenic (ie, those that elicit stronger immune responses in animal models) and strains that are considered less reactogenic.8 The more reactogenic strains have also been associated with a higher rate of lymphadenitis and osteitis, especially among neonates. Reduc ing the vaccination dosage for the more reactogenic strains also reduces the incidence of lymphadenitis. 464 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 21.4.1 Licensed vaccine BCG Vaccine SSI (Seqirus (NZ) Ltd) is a live attenuated vaccine, containing the less reactogenic Danish 1331 strain of M. bovis . The 0.1 mL dose for adults and children aged 12 months and older contains 2 -8 \u00d7 105 colony -forming units of M. bovis , and the 0.05 mL dose for infants contains 1 -4 \u00d7 105 colony -forming units. Other components and sodium glutamate, and glycerol. 21.4.2 Efcacy and effectiveness The exact immune response elicited by BCG vaccination and the mechanism of action in the host are still not well understood. There is no reliable established laboratory correlate for immunity to M. tuberculosis ,9 though this remains an active area of study.10 BCG protection is partial and varies according to the age at which vaccination is administered and the d isease phenotype in question. A meta -analysis of randomised controlled trials showed neonatal BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB (95% (95% CI: 0.23 -0.99).11 Studies conducted since the advent of interferon gamma release assays suggest BCG may also be effective against M. tuberculosis infection. A meta -analysis has estimated BCG effectiveness against M. tuberculosis infection at 20 percent , though different methods in the included studies each had a wide range of estimates.12 Thus, the principal role of BCG in New Zealand is to protect young children who are at greatest risk of disease, particularly miliary and meningeal disease.8 BCG is less effective in adults and older children, particularly if they already have latent infection. As BCG has been propagated in vitro for over 40 years, there are now several strains being manufactured.13 Immunological responses vary considerably across vaccine strains, but the data to date cannot differentiate which strains, if any, are overall more effective.14, 15 In low -income countries, a birth dose of BCG significantly reduces overall infant mortality.16, 17 BCG has had little effect in reducing the population rate and transmission of TB,18 so there are no herd immunity effects. Duration of protection is unknown, possibly 10 to 15 years, but it may be much long er in some populations.8 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 465 There have been a number of different approaches to using BCG in the control of TB in middle - and high -income countries.19 For example, the US has not had a BCG programme, whereas New Zealand (see Appendix 1 ) and the UK had programmes until 1990 and 2005, respectively. The WHO recommends that countr ies with low rates of active TB, such as New Zealand, target BCG vaccination at children who are at significantly increased risk of TB exposure through household contact.4 New Zealand (see section 21.5) and the UK now only offer BCG vaccine to high -risk individuals. A study from the Netherlands suggests that around 9,000 children from countries with rates greater than 50 per 100,000 population would have to be given BCG to prevent a severe case.20 The current recommendation to use neonatal BCG vaccination in populations with high rates of active TB is part of a control and treatment programme for TB in New Zealand, which includes active contact tracing and treatmen t of latent TB infection. There are large international efforts working to improve BCG vaccines and develop new, more effective vaccines.21 21.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standar ds for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) dark at +2oC to +8oC. Do not freeze. There are variances in strain potency between brands of BCG vaccine so vaccinators should always follow the instructions in the vaccine data sheet (available on www.medsafe.govt.nz ). BCG vaccine requires reconstitution before administration. It is presented as freeze -dried vaccine in a multi -dose vial with diluent in a separate vial. The diluent must be added to the freeze -dried vaccine vial and mixed gently (do not shake vigorously). Protect the vial from light. Leave the reconstituted vaccine to stand for one minute until it forms an opalescent liquid. Reconstituted v accine should be stored at 4oC, protected from sunlight and used within four hours. 466 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 21.4.4 Dosage and administration Only authorised vaccinators with BCG endorsement can administer BCG vaccine (see Appendix 4 ). Administer a dose of: 0.05 mL to infants aged under 12 months 0.1 mL to children aged 12 months or older and adults. The vaccine is administered by intradermal injection over the point of insertion of the left deltoid muscle (see sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4). No follow -up tuberculin skin testing is required. Repeat BCG vaccination is not recommended. BCG immunisation given in other countries BCG is one of the vaccines that are part of the WH O Expanded Programme on Immunization. It is given at birth in most low -income countries. The following Pacific Island countries22 recommend BCG vaccination at birth: Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Usually BCG vaccine is administered in the left deltoid area, but other sites of administration have also (although uncommonly) been used, such as the right deltoid. Revaccination with BCG is not recommended by the WHO.4 Co-administration with other vaccines BCG can be given simultaneously with any other vaccine. However, it must be administered into a separate site in a separate syringe. Because of the risk of local lymphadenitis, no further vaccinations should be given into the arm used for BCG for at least three months. If not given concurrently, BCG should be given at least four weeks after MMR or VV. Note that no time interval is requ ired between administration of BCG and rotavirus vaccines. HBIG (given at birth to babies of mothers with chronic HBV infection) or human normal immunoglobulin is thought not to reduce the effectiveness of BCG immunisation, which principally acts through cell-mediated immunity. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 467 21.5 Recommended immunisation Tuberculin skin testing (Mantoux) before BCG vaccination Tuberculin skin testing is not needed if BCG is given before age 6 months unless a history of contact with a known or possible case of TB is obtained. Although the tuberculin skin test is usually positive in the year following BCG vaccination, at least 50 percent of children will be negative beyond that time, so tuberculin skin testing still has utility for diagnosing TB infection. Children who have missed vaccination at birth may be vaccinated at any time up to age 5 years. If the child is 6 months or older, they should have a pre -vaccination tuberculin skin test to detect whether they have already been infected: vaccination only to being given if the child is uninfected. 21.5.2 BCG eligibility criteria TB is more common in migrants or families of migrants from high -incidence countries. However, all pregnant women should have a discussion with their lead maternity carer about the risk of TB for their baby. Neonatal BCG is recommended and funded for infants at increased risk of TB, as defined in Table 21.1. Table 21.1: Neonatal BCG eligibility criteria Neonatal BCG is recommended and funded for infants at increased risk of TB, dened as those who: will be living in a house or family/whnau with a person with either current TB or a histor y of TB have one or both parents or household members or carers who within the last five years lived for a period of six months or longer in countries with a TB rate 40 per 100,000* during their rst ve years will be living for three months or longer in a country with a TB rate 40 per 100,000.* * A list of high -incidence countries and their TB rates is available in Appendix 8 . 468 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 As a general indication, the following global areas have TB rates 40 per 100,000: most of Africa much of South America Russia and the former Soviet states the Indian subcontinent China (inc luding Hong Kong) and Taiwan South -East Asia some parts of the Pacific (Kiribati and Papua New Guinea have consistently high rates; see Appendix 8 for a list of the high -incidence countries). Neonates at risk should be identied antenatally by lead maternity care providers and antenatal referral made to the neonatal BCG service. Health care providers can also identify and refer neonates at risk. Im munisation is desirable before infants leave hospital. If this does not happen, immunisation should be arranged through the local medical ofcer of health. Infants born before 34 weeks ' gestation should have their BCG vaccination delayed until 34 weeks ' post-conceptual age.23 Babies bo rn after this or with low birthweight appear to produce an adequate response, based on tuberculin skin test responses.24, 25, 26 If the baby has not been vaccinated before leaving hospital, and if there is a history of current TB in a relative who has had contact with the baby, do not vaccinate immediately . Withhold vaccination, conduct tuberculin skin testing, seek paediatric advice and vaccinate only after the possibility of infection in the baby has been excluded. Vaccination may not protect the baby who is incubating disease and may prevent the tuberculin test from assisting with the diagnosis of disease. A parent 's/guardian 's request should not be accepted as an indication for immunisation. Parents/guardians seeking vaccination of children who do not meet the above criteria should be referred to the local medical ofcer of health to discuss the risks and benets of immunisation before a nal decisi on is made. BCG vaccine information for parents Information about the BCG vaccine is available in English and other languages from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ). This includes information for parents on why the vaccine is recommended, what to expect and how to care for the vaccination site. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 469 21.5.3 Other high -risk individuals or groups Repeat BCG vaccination is not recommended. Funded BCG may be offered to the following at -risk people if they are tuberculin skin test - or interferon gamma -release assay negative: contacts of active TB cases aged under 5 years (note that a contact exposed to TB in the preceding three months will need two negative tuberculin skin tests, 8 -12 weeks ap art, before vaccination) immigrants aged under 5 years from countries with a rate 40 per 100,000 health care workers and laboratory staff, depending on their risk of exposure people exposed to animals that are likely to be infected. Refer to the Guidelin es for Tuberculosis Control in New Zealand 201927 (available at www.health.govt.nz/publication/guidelines -tuberculosis -control -new-zealand - 2019 ). Vaccination for overseas travel is not available in New Zealand. 21.5.4 Pregnancy and breastfeeding BCG vaccine is not routinely recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. As BCG is a live vaccine, its use in pregnancy is not recommended (see section 21.6.2 ). If indicated, BCG vaccine may be given to breastfeeding women.28 470 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 21.6 Contraindications and precautions See also section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 21.6.1 Contraindications BCG vaccine should not be given to individuals: known to be hypersensitive to any component of the vaccine receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatment, including radiotherapy (see section 4.3) suffering from malignant conditions such as lymphoma, leukaemia, Hodgkin 's disease or other tumours of the reticulo -endothelial system in whom immunocompromise is known or suspected, such as individuals with hypogammaglobulinaemia - primary immune deciencies in children are often not detected until after the rst few weeks of life (ie, after BCG vaccine is given), so a family history of immune deciency should be sought and, if present, discussed with a paedi atrician before vaccination known to be infected with HIV, including neonates where the mother 's HIV status is unknown - maternal HIV infection should be excluded prior to neonatal vaccination; testing should have been offered as part of the National Anten atal HIV Screening Programme, and infants born to HIV -infected mothers should be under the care of a paediatrician with generalised infected skin conditions. Infants born to mothers who received immunosuppressive biologic agents during pregnancy must not be vaccinated with a BCG vaccine until they are identified as being immunocompetent. See section 4.3.7 and Table 4.2 for a list of the highly immunosuppressive medications with long half -lives that require a prolonged delay before vaccination (for up to one year in those being treated). These include monoclo nal antibody (mab) agents that readily cross the placenta . Each case should be assessed with specialist advice. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 471 21.6.2 Precautions BCG vaccine should be avoided in those who are pregnant (this is a counsel of caution, as no harmful effects to the fetus have been observed following accidental immunisation of the mother during pregnancy). In the case of eczema, an immunisation site should be chosen that is free of skin lesions. Infants born before 34 weeks ' gestation should have their BCG vaccination delayed until 34 weeks ' post-conceptual age.23 Avoid or defer immunisation in a child born with a condition that may require immunosuppressive therapy in future. Before BCG vaccination is scheduled for neonates (up to 4 weeks of age), a normal metabolic/immune deficiency (Guthrie test) result needs t o have been confirmed, specifically for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). 21.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 21.7.1 Potential responses Following the BCG injection, a white weal should appear. This should subside in approximately 30 minutes. The site requires no swabbing or dressing. A local reaction develops in 90 -95 percent of people vaccinated with BCG, which may include shallow ulceration, followed by healing and scar formation within three months. To ensure appropriate healing, encourage parents/caregiver s to keep the injection site clean and dry, to allow sore to scab and to avoid ointments and scratching. A minor degree of adenitis developing in the weeks following immunisation should be regarded as normal, not a complication. It may take months to resol ve. Suppurative adenitis may also take months to resolve; usually no treatment is required. 21.7.2 AEFIs AEFIs with BCG vary with age and vaccine strain and are summarised in Table 21.2. 472 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Table 21.2: Age -specic estimated risks for complications after administration of BCG vaccine Complication Incidence per 1 million vaccinations Age <1 year Age 1 -20 years Local 0.36 Fatal disseminated lesions 0.19-1.56 0.06-0.72 Reprinted with permission of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. Copyright \u00a9 The Union. Lotte A, Wasz -Hockert O, Poisson N, et al. 1988. Second IUATLD study on complications induced by intradermal BCG -vaccination. Bulletin of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease 63: 47 -59. The risk of BCG adverse reactions depends on many factors, including strain type, route of administration and the underlying immune state of the patient. Severe injection -site reactions , large ulcers and abscesses can occur in individuals who are tuberculin positive. Special care is needed both in interpreting initial tuberculin skin results and in delivering the BCG vaccine. Rarely, osteitis and osteomyelitis, lupoid and other types of skin disorders, and neurological disorders have been reported following BCG vaccination. Although rare, disseminated BCG disease is the most severe BCG vaccine complication occurring in immunocompromised people, such as children with primary immun e deciency. This needs rapid and aggressive treatment and has a high mortality. Keloid scars at the injection -site, although not uncommon, are largely avoidable. Some sites are more prone to keloid formation than others and vaccinators should adhere to the site recommended (mid -upper arm). Most experience has been with the upper arm site, and it is known that the risk of keloid formation increases greatly if the injection is given higher than the insertion of the deltoid muscle into the humerus. Every ef fort should be made to recover and identify the causative organism from any lesions that constitute a serious complication. Most local and regional adenopathy resulting from BCG vaccination will resolve spontaneously, and there is rarely a need for medica l or surgical intervention. Treatment recommendations for local abscess formation and suppurative lymphadenitis remain controversial.29 If suppurative adenitis reactions persist for longer than three months, seek specialist opinion. However, anyone presenting with m ore widespread or distant disease needs referral to a specialist. Abscesses and more serious complications should be reported to CARM (see 'AEFI reporting process - notifying CARM ' in section 1.6.3), and also reported to the local medical ofcer of health in the interests of quality control of the BCG vaccination technique. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 473 21.8 Public health measures It is a legal requirement that all cases of active TB be notied to the local medical ofcer of health. While there is no legal requirement to notify cases of latent TB infection that are being treated, for surveillance purposes and with the patient 's consent they should be reported to the local medical officer of health. Under the Health (Protection) Amendment Act 2016, the medical ofcer of health is given wide powers to investigate and control all TB cases and their contacts, while DHBs are required to make provision for the treatment and sup ervision of patients and their contacts. The primary purpose of neonatal BCG vaccination is to protect child case contacts from TB disease and its most devastating consequences. Screening of certain risk groups and case contact management are other elemen ts of TB control in New Zealand. These programmes do not obviate the need for BCG vaccination, as screening coverage is partial and contact tracing may not occur in time to prevent illness in child contacts. The local medical officer of health can advise o n local TB control policies, including issues in BCG immunisation. Both TB infection and BCG immunisation lead to the development of a cellular immune response, which can be detected by measuring dermal induration after the injection of tuberculin -puried protein derivative (eg, via the tuberculin skin test). A positive response to a tuberculin skin test may be an indication of current infection, previous natural infection or prior BCG immunisation. However, the false positive effect after vaccination will wane, rapidly in all individuals who receive the vaccine in the neonatal period and more slowly in those who are vaccinated at an older age such as during the primary -school years.30 In vitro tests have been developed to measure the release of interferon -gamma from host lymphocytes in response to well -defined antigens. The antigens used are not present in BCG strains of M. bovis or most non -tuberculous mycobacteria. Interferon gamma release assay has the advantage of greater specificity and convenience, but it is more expensive.31 For more information, refer to the 'Tuberculosis ' page of the Ministry o f Health website (www.health.govt.nz/our -work/diseases -and-conditions/tuberculosis ) and the 'Tuberculosis ' chapter of Control Manual www.health.govt.nz/publication/communicable -disease -control -manual ). 474 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 21.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet The data sheet states that BCG vaccine should not be given to infants born to HIV-positive mothers. The Ministry of Health recommends that BCG may be given to HIV-negative infants born to HIV -positive mothers - providing that the infant is confirmed to be HIV negative by appropriately -timed PCR tests befo re the vaccine is given.28, 32 Seek specialist advice.

Incubation period Usually 14 -16 days (range 10 -21 days). Period of communicability From 2 days before onset of the rash until all lesions have crusted. Incidence and burden of disease Without immunisation, most people have infection during childhood. Groups at risk of severe complications include pregnant women and their unborn babies, and immunocompromised individuals. Funded vaccine VV (Varivax) is a live attenuated vaccine. Dose, presentation, route 0.5 mL per dose after reconstitution. Pre-filled syringe and glass vial. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection . Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection . Funded vaccine indications and schedule 1 dose is funded for: children at age 15 months; or previously unvaccinated children turning 11 years old on or after 1 July 2017 who have not previously had a varicella infection (as determined by clinical history). Up to 2 doses are funded for certain special groups and their household contacts if non -immune to varicella. Recommended Susceptible children and adults who are not eligible by age for funded vaccine . Vaccine effectiveness One dose confers approximately 99% protection against severe disease and 80% protection against varicella disease of any severity. Breakthrough disease i s usually mild. Herd immunity has been documented. Contraindications Pregnancy Certain immune deficiency and immunocompromised states Known anaphylaxis to neomycin, gelatin or other vaccine components Active untreated TB (see section 22.6) Potential responses to vaccine Generally mild and self -limiting, and include local reactions, fever and mild papulo -vesicular rash in normal healthy individuals. Post-exposure prophylaxis VV may be used for post -exposure prophylaxis for immune - competent people if given within 5 days of exposure . Zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) is most effective if given as soon as possible after exposure but may be given up to 10 days post- exposure (see section 22.8.2 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 477 22.1 Virology Varicella (chickenpox) is a highly infectious disease caused by human herpes virus type 3 (varicella zoster virus or herpes zoster (zost er; shingles), a disease with considerable morbidity (see chapter 23). 22.2 Clinical features Varicella is one of the most infectious diseases known (along with pertussi s and measles). Transmission occurs via airborne droplets from, or contact with, vesicular lesions and possibly respiratory tract secretions. The incubation period is usually 14 -16 days (range 10 -21 days but can be longer in immunocompromised individuals a nd those who have received ZIG), and cases are infectious from two days before the onset of the rash until all the lesions have crusted. A maculopapular rash, which becomes vesicular, appears in crops over several days, rst on the face and scalp, later sp reading to the trunk and then the limbs. Vesicles, ranging in number from few to many hundred, dry and crust after three to four days. A hallmark of the rash is lesions in varying stages of development. Lesions on mucosal surfaces (mouth, vagina) can cause considerable distress. The rash is pruritic and is usually associated with mild fever, malaise, anorexia and listlessness. In most children, varicella is a mild disease but complications requiring hospitalisation and fatalities do occur. Secondary bacterial skin infections are common. Serious complications include central nervous system involvement (encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, stroke), pneumonia, secondary invasive bacterial infections, and even death. Adults are 25 times more likely to develop severe disease than children, with pneumonia being the most common complication, often requiring mechanical ventilation. VZV pneumonia carries an overall mortality rate of 10 -30 percent . Maternal varicella occurring in the first half of pregnan cy can cause the rare but devastating congenital varicella syndrome (see Table 22.4), whereas disease very late in pregnancy (from five days before to two days after de livery) may cause severe neonatal varicella infection. Pregnant women who contract varicella have an estimated 10-20 percent risk of developing VZV pneumonia. Others vulnerable to both VZV and zoster are those who are immunocompromised, such as people tak ing immunosuppressive medications (eg, cancer treatment or organ transplant patients) and those with HIV infection. Varicella can be a fatal disease in immunocompromised individuals. VZV infection is followed by the production of VZV -specific T -cell media ted immunity, necessary to maintain the latency of VZV in the ganglia and prevent reactivation as zoster. The immune response is boosted by subclinical reactivation of latent virus. The incidence of zoster increases with age as VZV -specific T cell -mediated immunity declines (see chapter 23). 478 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 22.3 Epidemiology 22.3.1 Global burden of disease In temperate climates, winter -spring epidemics occur with peak incidence in preschool and early primary school ages (1 -9 years). Around 90 percent of individuals have been infected by adolescence and fewer than 5 percent of adults are susceptible. The annual number of infections therefore approximates the birth cohort.1, 2 Transmission of the virus is less efcient in tropical climates. Adolescent and adult immigrants to New Zealand from such countries are more likely to be susceptible, placing them at risk of contracting chickenpox in their new environment. Being older, they are more likely to suffer severe disease. The long incubation and high transmissibility of VZV conspire to maximise disruption to families: by the time the rash occurs a child will have been infectious for two days; any susceptible household contacts will then become unwell just as the first child recovers. This results not only in morbidity but also in financial consequences for parents missing work. Crude hospitalisation admission rates in high -income countries range from around 2-6 per 100,000 pop ulation -year. Most of these admissions are children, consistent with the high incidence of varicella in children. Crude mortality rates ranged from 0.3-0.5 per million population -year with overall case fatality ratios of around 2 -4 per 100,000 cases. Almos t 90 percent of varicella hospital admissions occur in otherwise healthy and immunocompetent individuals.1, 2 VV has been introduced into childhood immunisation programmes overseas, including the US from 1995 and Australia from 2005, resulting in dramatic reductions in varicella morbidity, hospitalisations and mortality.3, 4, 5 By 2005 in the US, vaccine coverage was approximately 90 percent and varicella incidence had declined by more tha n 90 percent . Herd immunity was observed outside of age groups targeted for vaccination.1 Following the introduction of VV onto the childhood schedule, exposure to wild -type virus decreases. It has been theorised that a lack of boosting may lead to an increase in zoster in older adults. However, studies that have investigated this issue have been unable to attribute any increase in incidence of zoster to the childhood VZV vaccine programme.6, 7 Studies from the UK and Canada reported increases in zoster not associated with a vaccination programme, and some US data showed zoster rates were increasing prior to the initiation of their varicella vaccination programme.8, 9 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 479 22.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Varicella is not a notifiable disease, so data is limited for uncomplicated varicella, but the epidemiology is likely to be as described above for temperate climates. With increasing participation in early childhood services, a greater proportion of infections may now be o ccurring in preschool -aged children. It is expected that zoster numbers will rise in New Zealand as the population ages. Prospective nationwide surveillance of varicella in New Zealand children, conducted from November 2011 to October 2013, found that the incidence of varicella -related hospitalisation was 8.3 per 100,000 children per year - although this is likely to be a significant underestimate.10 Mori and Pacific children were disproportionately affected, with an almost three - and four -fold increase in the relative risk of hospitalisation for varicella or its complications, respectively. Of the hospitalised children, 9 percent required ICU admission and most of them were previously healthy. Almost one -third of h ospitalised children had multiple complications from varicella, and those with neurological complications were more likely to have ongoing problems at discharge. A retrospective survey of admissions to the paediatric intensive care unit at Auckland 's Starship Children 's Hospital during 2001 -2011 found 26 children admitted for varicella or its secondary complications.11 The main admission reasons were neurological (38.5 percent ) and secondary bacterial sepsis or shock (26.9 percent ). Four children died (15 percent ), three of whom were immunocompromised. A further eight children (31 percent ) had ongoing disability at discharge, most having had no prior medical condition. Based on overseas rates, it is estimated that up to one case of congenital varicella syndrome may b e expected in New Zealand each year, although few have been reported. In 2017, adults (aged 20 years and older) accounted for 25 percent of varicella -related hospital admissions;12 approximately one person per year dies from VZV infection, and most VZV -related deaths occur in adults .13 480 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 22.4 Vaccines 22.4.1 Available vaccines There ar e two live attenuated monovalent VVs registered (approved for use) and available (marketed) in New Zealand. Two quadrivalent live attenuated MMRV vaccines are registered but not currently available in New Zealand. Funded vaccine Monovalent VV (Varivax, MSD) contains not less than 1,350 PFU of the varicella - zoster virus (Oka/Merck strain). Other components and residuals include sucrose, -5 vaccines Monovalent VV Varilrix, (GSK): each 0.5 mL dose contains no less than 103.3 PFU (plaque -forming units) of the varicella virus (VZV Oka strain). Other components and residuals include amino acids, lactose, neomycin sulphate and po lyalcohols (mannitol and sorbitol). See section 22.5.2 for eligible infants age d 9-11 months available from hospitals. Quadrivalent MMRV - not currently available i n New Zealand (GSK) virus vaccines (Oka/Merck VZV) See also section 12.4.1 for information about IMMUNISATION Single -dose varicella vaccination programmes have had a dramatic impact on the incidence of VZV infections,14, 15, 16 hospitalisations3, 4, 17 and seri ous outcomes,5 particularly when high coverage rates are achieved. Indirect effects are also apparent. A 2014 systematic review of varicella vaccines found tha t a single dose of VV is moderately effective for preventing any severity of varicella (approximately 80 percent ) in immune -competent individuals, highly effective for preventing moderate -severe disease (approximately 95 percent ) and highly effective in pr eventing severe disease only (approximately 99 percent ).18 However, single -dose programmes are associated with outbreaks even among highly vaccinated groups.19, 20 The use of a second dose during outbreaks has been an effective strategy to prevent further cases. Catch -ups for non -immunised groups without a previous history of varicella are also important . There is a significant reduction in breakthrough disease when two doses are given. After a second dose in children the immune response is markedly enhanced, with over 99 percent of children attaining an immune response thought to provide protection, and the geometric mean antibody titre is also significantly increased. Over a 10 -year period the estimated vaccine efficacy of two doses for prevention of any varicella disease is 98 percent (compared to 94 percent for a single dose), with 100 percent efficacy for the prevention of severe varicella. The likelihood of breakthrough varicella is reduced by a factor of 3.3.21, 22 Because of this data, in 2006 the US authorities recommended a two -dose strategy for varicella prevention, with the first dose at age 12-15 months and the second at age 4 -6 years, as for MMR.19, 21 A Hong Kong study recommended reducing the time between doses, to age 12 months and 18 months, to reduce breakthrough cases and outbreaks in preschools.23 The antigenic components of MMRV vaccines are non -inferior compared with simultaneous administration of MMR and VV,24, 25 for both the first and second doses. Herd immunity In regions where universal varicella vaccination programmes have been implemented, significant declines in varicella cases and hospitalisation have been observed. These programmes also reduce circulating VZV and provide protection through herd immunity for those who are unable to be immunised, such as infants and immunocompromised individuals. In the US, the annual average age -adjusted mortality rate for varicella was 0.05 per million population during 2008 -2011, an 87 percent reduction from the pre -vaccine years.26 In Canada between 2000 and 2007, a single dose of VV was introduced to the immunisation schedules of different provinces at 12 months of age; most provinces also included catch -ups for susceptible children at preschool or school. An ecological study of varicella -related hospitalisations in Canada between 1990 and 2010 found that hospitalisation rates decreased in all age groups, including infants and those aged 20 -39 years.27 Similar herd effects were seen in Germany, with declines in varicella cases and hospitalisations in infants and adolescents who were not eligible for VV.28 482 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Duration o f immunity Varicella vaccination provides long -term but probably not lifelong immunity against VZV, in contrast to VZV natural infection. The duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine is difficult to study - especially if wild -type varicella co ntinues to circulate liberally in the community, providing natural boosting and prolonging the duration of protection.18 Many countries that initially introduced a single -dose vaccination programme have subsequently changed to a two -dose programm e as the epidemiology of the disease has changed over time. 22.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) presented as a lyophilised powder for reconstitution with the supplied diluent. The vaccine should be stored in the refrigerator at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C, although the diluent may be stored at room temperature (to a maximum of 25\u00b0C). Reconstituted vaccine should be used immediately, if possible, and discarded if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 150 minutes (2\u00bd hours) at room temperature. Do not freeze reconstituted vaccine.29 22.4.4 Dosage and administration The dose of monovalent VV is 0. 5 mL, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection in the deltoid area (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines Monovalent VV can be ad ministered concurrently with other vaccines, but in a separate syringe and at a different site. If not administered concurrently, the vaccine must be separated from other live vaccines (eg, MMR, BCG) by at least four weeks. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 483 22.5 Recommended immunisation schedule Recommendations for VV are summarised in Table 22.1 and discussed below. VV is recommended to be administered with the second MMR dose and Hib -PRP at age 15 months. VV can be used for a second (unfunded) dose or first dose after age 4 years, as appropriate for those not in eligible special groups . Table 22.1: Varicella vaccine recommendations and schedule Funded ind ividuals are shown in shaded boxes . See the Pharmaceutical Schedule (www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for any changes to funding decisions . Recommended and funded 1 dose of VV for: children at age 15 months; or previously unvaccinated children turning 11 years old on or after 1 July 2017 who have not previously had a varicella infection. 2 doses of VV, at least 6 weeks apart, for the following special groupsa non-immune patients: - with chronic liver disease who may in future be candidates for transplantationb - with deteriorating renal function before transplantationb,c - prior to solid organ transplant - prior to any planned immunosuppressio nd - for post -exposure prophylaxis of immune -competent in -patients patients at least 2 years after bone marrow transplantation, on the advice of their specialist patients at least 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, on the advice of their specialist HIV-positive patients who are non -immune to varicella, with mild or moderate immunosuppression, on the advice of an HIV specialist patients with inborn errors of metabolism at risk of major metabolic decompensation, with no clinical history of v aricella household contacts of paediatric patients who are immunocompromised or undergoing a procedure leading to immunocompromise, where the household contact has no clinical history of varicella household contacts of adult patients who have no clinical h istory of varicella and who are severely immunocompromised or undergoing a procedure leading to immunocompromise, where the household contact has no clinical history of varicella. Recommended, not funded 1 dose for all susceptible healthy children aged under 13 years who do not meet the eligibility criteria for the funded dose. 2 doses, at least 6 weeks apart, for all susceptible adolescents and adults. a. See chapter 4 'Immunisation of special groups ' for more information. b. See Table 4.3 for an accelerated immunisation schedule for infants in wh om liver or kidney transplant is likely . c. Check Starship Children 's Hospital guidelines for children with chronic kidney disease, dialysis and renal transplant, (available at www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/renal -vaccination -record -for-starship - paediatric -ckd). d. Note that immunosuppression due to steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy must be for a treatment period of greater than 28 days. 484 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 22.5.1 Usual childhood schedule From 1 July 2020, one dose of VV (Varivax) is funded for children at age 15 months. A second VV dose is not currently funded but may be purchased for those who wish to reduce the risk of breakthrough disease. A catch -up dose of VV is funded for previously unvaccinated children turning 11 years old who have not previously had a varicella infection (as determined by clinical history). This dose aims to protect those who have not become immune to varicella before adolescence, as disea se in adolescents and adults can be more severe. 22.5.2 Special groups Two doses of VV (Varivax), at least six weeks apart, are recommended and funded for the special groups listed in Table 22.1 above. Since Varivax is not licenced for inf ants under 12 months of age, Varilrix continues to be available from hospitals only for infants with certain medical conditions aged 9 -11 months of age requiring an accelerated immunisation schedule (see Table 4.3). Immunocompromised (including immunosuppressed) individuals The vaccine should not be given to immunocompromised individuals except under the direction and care of a specialist, following a suitable protocol19 (see section 4.3). Some clinical t rials of the original vaccine formulations were conducted in immunocompromised children (with leukaemia in remission or with HIV infection on antiretroviral treatment). One study found that half the vaccinated children receiving maintenance chemotherapy de veloped a rash up to one month after vaccination (40 percent of these required acyclovir treatment), compared with 5 percent of those no longer on chemotherapy.30 Despite this, the study concluded that the vaccine, Varivax, was safe, immunogenic and effective in these children.30, 31 The combination MMRV vaccine should not be used in immunocompromised individuals. Varicella immunisation of children with congenital T -cell immune deciency syndromes is generally contraindicated, but those with impaired humoral immunity may be immunised (see section 22.6.1 for further contraindications). Seek specialist advice. Household contacts of immunocompromised individuals Immunocompromised individua ls are at highest risk of severe varicella and zoster infections. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 485 Where such individuals cannot be vaccinated, it is important to vaccinate the non - immune household members and other close contacts (funded for household contacts) to provide 'ring-fence ' protection (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 22.7.1 ). 22.5.3 Recommended but not funded A single dose of VV is recommended for susceptible children who do not meet the eligibility criteria for funded vaccine ( Table 22.1). A second dose may also be purchased for those who wish to reduce the ris k of breakthrough disease. VV in a two -dose schedule is recommended but not funded for the following groups:19 adults and adolescents who were born and resided in tropical countries, if they have no history of varicella infection susceptible adults and adolescents (ie, those who have no prior history of chickenpox) susceptible individuals who live or work in environments wher e transmission of VZV is likely (eg, staff in early childhood education services, residents and staff members in institutional settings) susceptible individuals who live and work in environments where transmission can occur (eg, college students, inmates a nd staff members of correctional institutions, and military personnel) susceptible non -pregnant women of childbearing age susceptible international travellers19 health care workers (see below) susceptible individuals who have been exposed to varicella (see section 22.8.3 ). See section 22.8.1 for information about assessing susceptibility. Health care workers All health care workers should be immunised with VV if they are susceptible to varicella (not funded), particularly those within obstetric, paediatric and neonatal units, and those caring for immunocompromised children and adults. When a health care worker has a good history of prior varicella infection, no blood test is required.32 If there is not a good history of varicella infection, a blood test to assess susceptibility will be necessary, as many individuals with no clinical history of varicella are immune (see section 22.8). If a health care worker who has clinical contact with patients develops a rash as a result of the vaccine (around 5 percent ), they must be excluded from contact with immunocompromised or other at -risk patients and all ocated other duties, or excluded from their place of work, for the duration of the rash. 486 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 22.5.4 Pregnancy and breastfeeding Varicella vaccines are contraindicated in pregnant women. Pregnancy should be avoided for at least four weeks after vaccination.33 The vaccine 's safety for the fetus has not yet been demonstrated, although no congenital defects have been describe d following inadvertent administration to pregnant women. A pregnant woman in the household is not a contraindication for immunisation of a child, and the vaccine can be administered to non -immune mothers who are breastfeeding. 22.6 Contraindications and precautions See section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. 22.6.1 Contraindications Varicella vaccines are contraindicated for the following people: individuals with primary or acquired T -cell immune deciency states - consult the child 's paediatrician for advice33 individuals with blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems. individuals on high -dose steroids for more than two weeks (ie, children on 2 mg/kg per day or more of prednisone or its equivalent, or 20mg per day if their weight is over 10 kg) individuals are receiving or who have recently received chemotherapy (consult with specialist) individuals with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. individuals with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of VV or any component of the vaccine, including neomycin and gelatin. individuals with active untreated TB pregnant women - women should avoid pregnancy for at least four weeks after vaccination33 (see section 22.5.4 ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 487 22.6.2 Precautions Because of the association between Reye syndrome, natural varicella infection and salicylates, the vaccine manufacturers advise against the use of salicylates for six weeks after VV is given. There has been no reported associat ion between the vaccine and Reye syndrome, but avoidance of salicylates is recommended as a precaution,33 and physicians need to weigh the theoretical risk of Reye syndrome from the vaccine against the known risk from varicella disease in children receiving long -term salicylate therapy. Children on low-dose aspirin following cardiac surgery would be more at risk of thrombosis from stopping their aspirin34 than from the theore tical risk of Reye 's with VV. If tuberculin testing has to be done, it should be carried out before or simultaneously with vaccination because it has been reported that live viral vaccines may cause a temporary depression (anergy) of tuberculin skin sensitivity.35 As this anergy may last up to a maxim um of six weeks, tuberculin testing should not be performed within that period after vaccination to avoid false negative results. On the advice of their specialist, VV may be administered to: patients at least two years after bone marrow transplantation patients at least six months after completion of chemotherapy HIV-positive patients who are non -immune to varicella, with mild or moderate immunosuppression. For suggested intervals between receipt of human normal immunoglobulin or other blood products and VV, see Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 . 22.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 22.7.1 Potent ial responses A 2013 systematic review of varicella vaccines found that mild adverse events were the most frequently reported AEFIs.36 This includes injection -site reactions such as pain, swelling and redness, which occurred in up to 28 percent of recipients. There was no increased risk of cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis or ischaemic stroke following vaccination. Post-marketing surveilla nce in the US found the rate of AEFIs to be 30 per 100,000 doses of VV, and the rate of serious AEFIs was less than 4 per 100,000 doses. Fever has been reported in 15 percent of healthy children following VV and 10 percent of adults.33, 37 488 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Post-VV rash In approximately 1 -3 percent of immunised children, a localised rash develops, and in an additional 3 -5 percent a generalised varicella -like rash develops.33 These rashes typically consist of two to five lesions and may be maculopapular rather than vesicular; lesions usually appear 5 -26 days after immunisation. Not all rashes can be attributable to the vaccine;33 some ma y be due to exposure to wild -type virus, prior to vaccination. Transmission of vaccine virus to contacts of vaccinated individuals In healthy vaccine recipients, transmission of vaccine virus to contacts is exceedingly rare, documented in nine immunised p eople and resulting in 11 secondary cases. The documented risk exists only if the immunised person develops a rash.33 Err on the side of caution and isolate the vaccine recipient if they are a household contact of an immunocompromised individual and a post -immunisation rash occurs. If an immunocompromised individual inadvertently comes in contact with a vaccine recipient who has a varicella -like rash, the administration of zoster immunoglobulin (ZIG) and/or acyclovir should be considered (see below).33 Intravenous acyclovir may be required if symptoms develop. 22.7.2 AEFIs Vaccine virus shingles The Oka strain of VZV used in the available vaccines can establish latent ganglionic infection in vaccine recipients and later reac tivate to produce clinical zoster (shingles). The risk of zoster is lower, and the clinical severity milder, in immunocompentent vaccine recipients than in naturally infected children. A cohort study in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (who have a high rate of zoster in childhood) showed that vaccine recipients had less than one -fth the zoster rate of their naturally infected counterparts.30, 38 Some zoster lesions in vaccine recipients have been shown to contain wild-type virus, likely acquired prior to vaccination.33 Febrile seizures with MMRV vaccine MMRV vaccines are not currently available in New Zealand. Compared with the use of MMR and VV at the same visit, use of MMRV vaccine requires one fewer injection but is associated with a higher risk of fever and febrile seizures 5 to 12 days after the first dose among children aged 12 -23 months (approximately one extra febrile seizure for every 2,300 -2,600 MMRV vaccine doses).39 After the second dose, there are no differences in incidence of fever, rash or febrile seizures among recipients of MMRV vaccine compared with recipients of MMR and VV.39 There is no evidence of an association with increased febrile seizure s when MMRV is given to toddlers as a second dose of MMR.40 For example, in Australia, the first dose of MMR is given at 12 months and the second dose is given as MMRV at 18 months. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 489 22.8 Public health measures At present, VZV is not a notifiable disease in New Zealand. 22.8.1 Susceptibility In general, a positiv e history of chickenpox can be taken as indicating immunity, provided there has not been an intervening bone marrow transplant or other immunosuppressive therapy. Recall of varicella or characteristic rash is reliable evidence of immunity. In people with n o history or recall of the rash, 70 -90 percent are found to be immune.33 Consult with the local laboratory a bout the availability and interpretation of high -titre immunoglobulin available from the New Zealand Blood Service for passive immunisation of varice lla in high -risk individuals. It is most effective if given within 96 hours after exposure, but may be have some efficacy if given up to 10 days post -exposure.39, 41, 42, 43 ZIG should be given intramuscularly.43 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be given when ZIG is unavailable. For further information, see Starship Child Health guidelines (available at www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/zoster -immunoglobulin ). The decision whether to offer ZIG depends on:43 the likelihood that the exposed person is susceptible to varicella the probability that a given exposure to varicella will result in infection the likelihood that complications would develop if the person exposed is infected. Contact (exposure) can be classified as follows:43 household con tact - infection is very likely to occur in a susceptible individual living with an infected contact playmate contact - more than one hour of play indoors with infected individual newborn infant contact - when the mother of a newborn infant develops chicke npox (but not shingles) from seven days before to seven days after delivery hospital contact - individuals in the same two -bed room or have face -to-face contact for longer than five minutes. 490 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Provided exposure has occurred and susceptibility is likely, ZIG is recommended for : pregnant non -immune women (see section 22.8.6 below and discuss with an infectious diseases physician) newborn infants whose mother had onset of chickenpox (but not shingles) within seven days before or after delivery (see section 22.8.6 ) hospitalised premature infants whose mothers have no history of chickenpox, or who were born at less than 28 weeks ' gestation, or with birthweight less than 1,000 g, irrespective of maternal history immunocompromised individuals - discuss the use of ZIG with their specialists, as appropriate. Dosage of ZIG ZIG prepared by CSL Behring in Melbourne, derived from human plasma donated in New Zealand, is available in si ngle vials containing 200 IU varicella -zoster antibody. The actual volume in the vial is stated on the label. The recommended dose is based on body weight and is shown in Table 22.2 below. ZIG should be given intramuscularly, not intravenously.43 Table 22.2: Dose of ZIG based on body weight Weight of patient (kg) Dose (IU) Number of vials 0-10 125 1 10.1-20 250 2 20.1-30 375 2 30.1-40 500 3 over 600 3 Source: CSL Behring. -medicine - datasheets/Immunoglobulins February 2020). If ZIG is not available, IVIG can be used. The titre of anti -varicella antibody will vary between lots, and the blood transfusion centre haematologist needs to be contacted to confirm the appropriate dose when IVIG is used. 22.8.3 Post-exposure vaccination and outbreak control VV may be used for post -exposure prophylaxis of susceptible individuals aged 9 months or older, if there are no contraindications to vaccine use33 - see Table 22.3. Data from the US and Japan from household, hospital and community settings IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 491 indicates that VV is effective in preventing illness or modifying varicella severity if used within three days, and possibly up to ve days, of exposure. Table 22.3: Post -exposure varicella vaccination recommendations Note: Funded individuals are shown in the shaded rows below . See the Pharmaceutical Schedule (www.pharmac.govt.nz ) for any ch anges to the funding decisions.

VV can be purchased for individuals who ar e not eligible to received funded VV, including infants aged 9 months to under 12 months who do not have an eligible condition listed in Table 21.1. d. Children who were under age 12 months when they received VV for post -exposure prophylaxis will still be eligible for the age 15 -month dose. Ensure there are at least 6 weeks between doses. VV may not prevent disease in all cases because some individuals may have been exposed to the same source as the index case.33 If exposure to varicella does not result in infection, post -exposure vaccination should induce protection against subsequent exposure. If the exposure results in infection, no evidence indicates that administration of VV during the pre -symptomatic or prodromal stage of illness increases the risk for AEFIs. Note that although this method of immunisation may be successful, it is not necessarily reliable. Immunisation before exposure is therefore recommended as the preferred method of prevent ing outbreaks. 22.8.4 In-hospital exposure In the event of an exposure: susceptible staff should be excluded from contact with high -risk patients from day 8 to day 21 after exposure to varicella (or shingles in an immunocompromised patient) hospital staff who ha ve no history of chickenpox and who will be in contact with pregnant women or high -risk patients should be tested for varicella zoster antibodies; vaccination is recommended for those who are not immune or whose serostatus cannot be promptly determined. Two doses of VV are funded for post -exposure prophylaxis of immune -competent in - patients who are to varicella (see section 22.8.3 ). 492 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 22.8.5 Exclusion from school or early childhood education services Parents/guardians should be advised that: infected children should be excluded from early childhood education services or school until fully recovered, or all lesions have crusted. Lesions from mild breakthrough disease in immunised children may not crust but these children should be excluded until no new lesions appear for 24 hours33 immune -deficient children should be excluded from early childhood education services or school until three weeks after the last documented case. 22.8.6 Care of pregnant women after exposure Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications from varicella. If an immune -competent pregnant woman with no history of varicella or vaccination is exposed to varicella, it is recommended, where possible, that her varicella antibodies be assessed ( Figure 22.1). If there is no evidence of immunity, two possible courses of action are available: either administer ZIG, or await the onset of symptoms and as soon as possible commence the administration of acyclovir, which is effective in this situation and now regarded as safe in pregnancy. Discuss the clinical circumstances with an infectious diseases physician before deciding on which course of action is best. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for the pregnant woman with severe complications of varicella. ZIG given to a pregnant woman within ve days of delivery may not protect the fetus/neonate: the neonate should receive ZIG on delivery and may need treatment with acyclovir ( Figure 22.2). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 493 Figure 22.1: Management of pregnant women exposed to varicella or zoster Every effort should be made to confirm the diagnosi s in the suspected positive contact and assess significance of exposure.a Exposure or symptoms in the final two weeks of pregnancy should always be discussed with a specialist. a. Exposure to varicella or zoster for which ZIG is indicated for susceptible persons includes: living in the same household as a person with active chickenpox or herpes zoster; face -to-face contact with a case of chickenpox for at least 5 minutes; close contact (eg, touching, hugging) with a person with active zoster. b. Efficacy of acyclovir for post -exposure prophylaxis has not been tested in controlled trials. Dose is 800 mg orally, 5 times per day for 7 days. c. The mother is at risk of pneumonitis if she is in the second half of pregnancy; has underlying lung diseas e; is immunocompromised; or is a smoker.

Pregnant women exposed to VZV should be counselled about the risks of congenital varicella syndrome (CVS), a rare but devastating disorder that can occur following varicella zoster infection during pregnancy (see Table 22.4). The risk of CVS is greatest in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Large case studies suggest that the rate of CVS is 0.4 percent when maternal infection occurs up to week 12 of pregn ancy, and 2 percent from weeks 13 to 20. There is no single diagnostic test available for CVS. Regular fetal ultrasound for developmental anomalies is recommended.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 495 22.9 Variations from the vaccine data sheet The VV (Varivax) data sheet recommends that children aged 12 months to 12 years receive a second dose administered at least three months after the first to ensure optimal protection against varicella.29 The Ministry of Health instead recommends a single dose of VV for healthy children at 15 months or 11 years of age (see section 22.5.1 ) and two d oses for individuals with a special groups condition (see section 22.5.2 ).

Direct contact with zoster vesicles has a low risk of causing varicella in non -immune individuals - can be prevented by covering rash. There is potential for aerosol transmissio n from some immunocompromised cases with viraemia . Period of communicability Until lesions have crusted. Incidence and burden of disease Increasing incidence with age; lifetime risk about 1 in 3. For those aged over 85 years, the risk is 1 in 2. Complications include post -herpetic neuralgia and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Funded vaccine Zoster formulation of the live attenuated varicella vaccine. Zoster vaccine is registered for use from age 50 years. Do not giv e to children. Dose, presentation, route 0.65 mL per reconstituted dose. Vial of vaccine, plus diluent in a pre -filled syringe. The vaccine must be reconstituted prior to injection. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Funded vaccine indications and recommended schedule One dose of ZV is funded for: individuals at age 65 years, on or after 1 April 2018, or catch -up of individuals aged 66 -80 years, inclusive (the catch -up programme ceases on 31 December 202 1). ZV may be given to individ uals with a prior history of zoster. After the zoster episode has resolved the vaccination benefit is unclear - wait at least 1 year be fore administering the vaccine. Recommended May be considered for individuals aged 50 -64 years with increased risk of zo ster due to comorbidities (unfunded). Household contacts (age from 50 years) of immunocompromised individuals who are non -immune to varicella (unfunded unless within eligible age groups). Vaccine efficacy/ effectiveness Reduces the burden of zoster illnes s by 61 percent in all adults aged over 60 years, by 66 percent in those aged 60 -69 years and by 55 percent in those aged 70 years and older. The role of revaccination is currently unknown. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 499 Contraindications See section 23.6.1 Risk of disseminated vaccine -derived disease including certain primary and secondary immune deficiencies and immunosuppressive therapy, including high -dose st eroids . Known systemic hypersensitivity to neomycin. TB. Pregnancy. 23.1 Virology Varicella -zoster virus (VZV) is a DNA virus from the herpesvirus family. The virus is usually acquired in childhood and primary infection with VZV causes varic ella disease (chickenpox). Herpes zoster a clinical syndrome caused reactivation of latent VZV, which resides in the dorsal root or trigeminal nerve ganglia after primary infection. VZV is usually acquired in childhood, but it i s often many decades before the virus reactivates, at times when cellular immunity is compromised and is unable to maintain suppression of the virus. 23.2 Clinical features Herpes zoster (shingles) occurs when the cell -mediated immune response is impaired and unable to maintain suppression of latent varicella -zoster virus reactivation (see chapter 22). Zoster occurs only by loss of suppression and reactivation of the patient 's own virus - which is often acquired in childhood; it is not acquired from other patients with zoster or varicella.1 But the zoster rash vesicles contain low levels of VZV that are able, through direct contact, to potentially cause varicella in VZV -na\u00efve individuals. Zoster presents clinically as a unilateral vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution in most cases. The dermatomal distribution of the rash is the key diagnostic feature. In 70-80 percent of zoster cases in older adults, prodromal pain and/or itching occurs three to four days before the appearance of the rash.2 In the majority of patients, zoster is an acute and self -limiting disease, with the rash lasting 10 -15 days. However, complications can occur, especially with increasing age. Although most zoster cases occur in adults aged 40 years or older, it may be seen less commonly in infants and children . In those aged under 2 years may reflect in utero chickenpox, with the greatest risk arising following exposure between 25 and 36 weeks ' gestation, and reactivation in early life. Infants who get varicella at a young age have a higher change of having zost er before the age 20 years. A common complication of zoster is post -herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last several months or even years. A systematic review of the incidence and complications of zoster found t hat the risk of developing post-herpetic neuralgia ranges between 5 and about 30 percent (depending on the 500 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 type of study design, age distribution of the study populations and definition).3 The risk rises with age, and it is uncommon in healthy children and young people. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is another complication of zoster, which occurs when VZV reactivation affects the ophthalmic branch o f the trigeminal nerve. HZO can occur with or without eye involvement, and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring and loss of vision. About 10 percent of zoster patients develop HZO, if that dermatome is affected, and the risk is simila r across all age groups.3 Zoster occurs more commonly in immunocompromised individuals, such as due to immunosuppression (eg, organ transplant patients, treatments for cancer and immune - mediated inflammatory diseases) and those with HIV. Up to 10 percent of children treated for a malignant neoplasm may develop zoster. In immunocompromised patients, extensive viraemia in the absence of a vigorous immune response can result in a disseminated form of zoster that includes severe multi -organ disease.2, 4 There is an increased risk of airborne transmission of VZV for immunocompromised individuals with viraemia. Other risk factors for developing zoster include rheumatoid arthritis,5 sleep disorders6 and type 2 diabetes.7 23.3 Epidemiology 23.3.1 Global burden of disease Zoster is a sporadic disease occurring as a reactivation of the VZV in individuals who have previously had chickenpox. Approximately one in three people will develop zoster during their lifetime with the incidence rising as cell -mediated immunity to VZV declines with age;8 50 percent of those aged 85 years or over will suffer zoster.9, 10 A systematic review documented an incidence rate between 3 and 5 per 1,000 person - years in North America, Europe and Asia -Pacific.3 The incidence rate was about 6 -8 per 1,000 person -years at age 60 years and 8 -12 per 1,000 person -years at age 80 years. Recurrence is greater in females than males (about 7 percent after eight years compared with 4 percent for males). Third episodes are rare. VZV is present in lesions of zoster and is transmissible via direct contact with the vesicles to other susceptible individuals (causing chickenpox). Airborne transmission can occur from immunocompromised individuals with disseminated zoster. Episodes of zoster in older individuals provide a constant mechanism for reintroducing the virus, causing varicella in non -immune individuals who are in close contact, who then spread the v irus to other susceptible individuals. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 501 Following the introduction of VV onto the childhood schedule, exposure to wild -type virus decreases. It has been theorised that a lack of boosting may lead to an increase in zoster in older adults. However, several s tudies that have investigated this issue, observed an increase in zoster prior to VV programme introductions and have been unable to attribute any increase in incidence of zoster to childhood VV programmes.11, 12, 13, 14 Such increases have been observed in countries both with and without chil dhood varicella immunisation. 23.3.2 New Zealand epidemiology Zoster hospitalisations by age group during 2018/2019 are shown in Figure 23.1, with around 60 percent occurring in adults aged 60 years and older. Hospitalisations are predicted to account for only a very small proportion of the overall zoster cases as most are managed in primary care. Interrogation of general practice electronic records found the inciden ce of zoster in New Zealand to be similar (approximately 5 per 100,000 patient -years rising to 12.8 per 100,000 in those aged 80 -90 years) to the global incidence estimates described in section 23.3.1 .11 In 2018/2019, there were 483 hospitalisations zoster. Figure 23.1: Hospitalisations with as primary diagnosis by age group, 2018/2019 Source: Ministry of Health. 502 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 23.4 Vaccine 23.4.1 Available is a live attenuated varicella -zoster virus vaccine. It is a higher titre formulation of the varicella vaccine and is designed to protect against zoster in those already immune to varicella.12 By mimicking the immune response seen following a case of zoster and boosting cell -mediated immunity in older adults, the incidence and severity of zoster is reduced by the high -titre vaccine. Funded vacc ine Each 0.65 mL dose of ZV (Zostavax, MSD) contains a minimum of 19,400 PFU of strain of VZV. Other hydrolysed porcine urea, sodium dibasic, potassium potassium chloride, residual components of MRC -5 cells (including DNA and protein), and trace quantities of neomycin and bovine calf serum. The vaccine contains no preservative. and AS01 B adjuvant system, is designed to specifically boost T -cell immunity against VZV. It has shown good efficacy in older adult age groups and immunocompromised groups against zoster and a ssociated complications.13, 14 This vaccine is not available currently in New Zealand. 23.4.2 Efficacy and effectiveness A pivotal clinical trial, the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS), recruited 38,546 adults aged 60 years and older, with either a history of chickenpox or of having lived in the US for more than 30 years, in which, the participants received the high -dose live zoster vaccine or a placebo. The results showed that the zoster vaccine reduced the burden of illness of zoster by 61 percent (95% CI: 51 -69) in all age groups, by 66 percent (95% CI: 52-76) in the age group 60 -69 years, and by 55 percent (95% CI: 40 -67) in those aged 70 years and older. There was also a 67 percent reduction (95% CI: 48 -79) in post - herpetic n euralgia in all age groups.12 A cohort study of individuals in the US aged 65 years and older found zoster vaccine was associated with a 48 percent reduction (95% CI: 39 -56) incident zoster and in PHN.15 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 503 A review of the efficacy of ZV in preventing zoster and PHN concluded that zoster vaccine is safe, effective and highly recommended for the immunisation of immune - competent individuals over the age of 60 y ears.1 Following the introduction of zoster vaccination programme to adults aged 70 years (with catch up for those aged 71 -79 years) in the UK, vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 64 percent (95% CI: 60 -80) against zoster and 81 percent (95% CI: 61-91) against PHN. Vaccine effectiveness was lower in those who had a previous history of zoster (47 percent ; 95% CI: 31 -58).16 Duration of protection The persistence of ZV efficacy was measured for 11 years using a subgroup of individuals from the Shingles Prevention Study discussed above. Vaccine efficacy was statistically significant for the incidence of zoster until eight years post -vaccination.17 Clinical efficacy of ZV was shown to be increasingly limited with time beyond five years post-vaccination. In older adults in the UK, effectiveness of ZV against zoster waned with time by the third year post -vaccination to an estimated 45 percent (95% CI: 29 -57).16 In adults aged 60 years or older in the US, the effectiveness of ZV against zoster was shown to decrease from 69 percent in the first year to 4 percent eight years after vaccination; however, after an initial decline in the first year, effectiveness remained at around 30-40 percent up to five years after vaccination.18 Duration of protection is therefore variable. A compromise is required around the timing of the vaccination -vaccine effectiveness against zoster is highest when a person i s vaccinated at a younger age but protection from a single dose may not last to an age where the risk of incidence of PHN is greatest. Studies have shown that booster doses in adults are immunogenic, but there are no reports on efficacy of giving further doses. The immune response to a second dose declines with advancing age but is similar to the response seen following first doses of individuals of the same age: a prior dose neither enhances nor impairs the response to a booster dose.19 There do not appear to be any safety concerns with administering a second dose of ZV.20 Although it is not currently recommended, individuals who previously received an unfunded ZV dose ma y choose to receive a funded ZV dose, if eligible. At the time of writing, there were no current international guidelines on giving further doses of ZV. 23.4.3 Transport, storage and handling Transport according to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) (available the supplied diluent. Once reconstituted, ZV must be used within 30 minutes. 23.4.4 Dosage and administration ZV is registered for adults aged 50 years and older. Do not give to children. If a patient age is less than 50 years, c onsider giving VV if the patient is not immune to varicella. The dose of reconstituted ZV is 0.65 mL, to be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously if indicated, in the deltoid area (see section 2.2.3). Co-administration with other vaccines ZV can be concurrently administered with influenza vaccine using separate syringes and sites. Historically, there were concerns that VZV antibody titres were lower in ind ividuals who received ZV and 23PPV at the same visit, compared with those given the vaccines four weeks apart. However, VZV antibodies are not considered a measure of protection against zoster, and all recent evidence suggests that ZV can be given concurre ntly with 23PPV.21 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend that ZV and 23PPV be administered at the same visit if the individual is eligible for both vaccines.22 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 505 23.5 Recommended Herpes zoster vaccine (ZV) recommendations Note: Neither history of previous varicella infection nor evidence of prior immunity to VZV is required prior to the routine administration of ZV (except for certain immunocompromised persons, refer below). Funded individuals are shown in the shaded rows . Recommended and funded 1 dose of ZV is recommended and funded for: individuals aged 65 years, on or after 1 April 2018 catch -up of individuals aged 66 -80 years, incl usive (until 31 December 202 1). For consideration, but not funded 1 dose of ZV may be considered, but is not funded, for individuals aged 50 -64 years: who are at increased risk of zoster23, 24, 25, 26 and who may benefit from being vaccinated earlier than the routine schedule: - with asymptomatic HIVa (if CD4+ lymphocyte end-stage kidney diseasea (CKD stages 4 -5) - at least 4 weeks prior to commencing high -dose immunosuppressive therapya,b and/or solid organ transplantationa,b - after ceasing high -dose immunosuppressive therapya,b - at least 2 years post -HSCTa,b with autoimmune diseasea,b (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn 's disease, ulcerative colitis) - with a first -generation family history of zoster - with depression - with diabetes - with psychiatric disorders - with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. who are household contacts of immunocompromised individuals. a. Seek specialist advice. Serological confirmation of previous VZV infection is recommended before administering ZV. If an individual is VZV -seronegative, give VV. If VZV -seropositive, give ZV. See also section 4.3. b. See Table 4.1 and Table 4.2. 23.5.1 Recommended and funded Recommendations for ZV (Zostavax) are in Table 23.1 above. One dose of ZV is funded for individuals at age 65 years (on or after 1 April 2018) , with a catch -up programme until 31 December 202 1, with one dose of ZV funded for individuals aged 66 -80 years, inclusively. 506 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 23.5.2 Other considerations Vaccination of individuals aged 50 -64 years (unfunded) ZV (Zostavax) is registered in New Zealand for indivi duals aged 50 years or older. It may be considered, but is not funded, for individuals aged 50 -64 years who are at increased risk of zoster due to comorbidities23, 24, 25, 26 and who may benefit from being vaccinated earlier than the routine schedule and/or they are a household contact of an immunocompromised individual (see Table 23.1). However, the exact duration of vaccine efficacy is not known, and it is probable that protection following a single vaccine dose wanes with time.23 The need for revaccination is not yet determined.23 Dosing with ZV is often strategic and based on clinical consideration (see below). Individuals with a history of zoster (shingles) Individuals with a history of a previous episode of zoster can be given ZV. It is possible that a history of previous zoster may be inaccurate or a mistaken diagnosis.23 In addition, the risk of a re peat episode of zoster has been estimated at approximately 5 percent in immunocompetent individuals.23 There are no recognised safety concerns in giving the vaccine to people with prior history of zoster.27 The length of time following an episode of zoster after which it may be beneficial to vaccinate has not been estab lished.23 It is suggested that the vaccine could be given at least one year after the episode of zoster has resolved.23 Household contacts of immunocompromised individuals ZV is contraindicated in individuals with current or recent severe immunocompromise due to primary and secondary immune -deficiency states, or due to immunosuppressive therapy (see section 23.6). However, VV or age -appropriate ZV can be given safely to their household contacts. VV is funded for non -immune household contacts of patients who are immunocompromised or undergoing a procedure or treatment leading to immunocompromise. If the household contact is immune to varicella and aged 50 years and older, giv e ZV (funded at age 65 years with a catch -up, until 31 December 2021, for those aged 66 -80 years inclusive; unfunded for those aged 50 -64 years). If a vaccinated person develops a varicella - or zoster -like rash, they should cover the rash and avoid contac t with persons who are immunocompromised for the duration of the rash, at least until it crusts .23 See also 'Household contacts' in section 4.3.1 for general recommendations for vaccination of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 507 Serological testing Generally, neither a history of previous varicella infe ction nor evidence of prior immunity to VZV is required prior to the routine administration of the zoster vaccine.23 Most older people in New Zealand are sero positive to VZV due to previous primary varicella infection. Serological confirmation of previous VZV infection is recommended before administering ZV to individuals with HIV, and in those who are anticipating significant future immunosuppression or who have ceased immunosuppressive therapy (see section 23.6.2 ).23 Individuals in these categories who have negative VZV IgG should generally not be given ZV. Upon specialist advice, VV may be given instead of ZV to seronegative individuals. Laboratory testing to check for an immune response after ZV is not recommended.23 23.6 Contraindications and precautions See section 2.1.3 for pre -vaccination screening guidelines and section 2.1.4 for general contraindications for all vaccines. Seek specialist advice for primary and secondary immunodeficiency conditions (see section 23.6.2 live attenuated and administration to individuals who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient may result in disseminated varicella -zoster virus infectio n, including fatal outcomes. If ZV is inadvertently administered to these individuals, seek specialist advice immediately and notify CARM. Do not give to children. ZV is not contraindicated for use in individuals who are receiving low -level immunosuppressive therapy, for example: topical/inhaled corticosteroids or low -dose corticosteroids; who are corticosteroids as replacement therapy (eg, for adr enal insufficiency); low -dose weekly methotrexate or azathioprine (see section Table 4.1 and Table 4.2). Contraindications to ZV include: a history of anaphylaxis to neomycin and gelatin (refer to chapter 2) primary and secondary immune -deficiency states due to conditions, such as acute and chronic leu kaemias; lymphoma; other conditions affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system; immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS (see section 23.6.2 for asymptomatic HIV infecti on); and cellular immune deficiencies - see sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 508 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 biologics). Note: ZV is not contraindicated for use in individuals are receiving low-level immunosuppressive therapy, for example: topical/inhaled corticosteroids corticosteroids; as for adrenal insufficiency); low -dose methotrexate untreated TB pregnancy. 23.6.2 Precautions HIV Asymptomatic HIV -positive individuals with a CD4+ lymphocyte count 200 cells/mm3 may be vaccinated upon specialist advice. Results of a phase II trial in HIV -infected adults indicated that ZV was ge nerally safe and immunogenic in those with CD4+ lymphocyte count 200 cells/mm3, with no cases of vaccine strain infection.28, 29 Serological confirmation of previous VZV infection is recommended prior to vaccination.27 If a person is seronegative, give VV (funded); if seropositive give ZV (funded for those aged 65 years with a catch -up for those aged 66 -80 years inclusive, until 31 December 202 1; unfunded for those aged 50 -64 years). Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or AI DS should not be vaccinated. Immunocompromised individuals ZV is contraindicated in individuals with current or recent severe immunocompromise due to primary and secondary immune -deficiency states, or due to immunosuppressive therapy . However, individuals receiving low -level immunosuppressive therapy may be considered for vaccination upon specialist advice. Individuals who anticipate significant future immunocompromise because of an existing illness and/or its treatment may be given ZV upon specialist advice.27 This includes individuals due to receive solid organ transplant, chemotherapy or systemic radiotherapy, and individuals w ith IMIDs (autoimmune disease). Vaccination at least four weeks prior to the onset of immunocompromise may be appropriate, upon specialist advice.27 Individuals whose treatment with high -dose systemic immunosuppressive therapy has ceased may be vaccinated upon specialist advice if an appropriate time interval has passed.27 Serological confirmation of previous VZV infection is recommended prior to vaccination in these immunocompromised groups. If a person is seronegative, give VV (funded if an eligible condition); if seropositive give ZV ( one dose is funded at age 65 years with a catch -up for those aged 66 -80 years inclusive, until 31 December 202 1; unfunded for those aged 50 -64 years). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 509 Individuals who are only receiving localised radiotherapy to treat a tumour or lesion can be vaccinated with live vaccines, such as ZV, at any time prior to, during or after radiotherapy.30 See Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 in sections 4.3.5 and 4.3.6 for recommendations for the use of ZV in individuals on immunosuppressive therapy. 23.7 Potential responses and AEFIs 23.7.1 Potential responses ZV is generally well tolerated. In clinical trials, injection -site rea ctions occurred more commonly in ZV recipients than in placebo recipients. PCR testing of VZV from zoster - like rashes occurring in the 42 -day period following vaccination are much more likely to be due to wild VZV than to the vaccine virus.2 23.7.2 AEFIs A large safety review of ZV in 193,083 ind ividuals aged 50 years and older supports the pre-licensure clinical trial data.31 The ZV was found to be safe and well tolerated with no increased risk for the adverse event groupings of cerebrovascular events, cardiovascular events, meningitis, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome or Bell 's palsy. A small increased risk of allergic reactions one to seven days after vaccination was reported. A post -marketing observational study of 29,000 individuals aged 60 years and older did not identify any safety concerns within 42 days of receiving ZV vaccine.32 23.8 Variations from the vaccine data sheet The ZV (Zostavax) data sheet states that the ZV vaccine and 23PPV (Pneumovax 23) should not be given concurrently. The Ministry of Health recommends that ZV vaccine and 23PPV may be given concu rrently21, 22 (see section 23.4.4 ). The ZV data sheet states that ZV should not be given to individuals with HIV/AIDS. The Ministry of Health recommends that asymptomatic HIV -positive individuals with a CD4+ lymphocyte count 200 cells/mm3 may be vaccinated upon specialist advice (see sectio n 23.6.2 ).21, 22 510 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 References 1.

Vaccines which are used for targeted programmes only (ie, hepatitis A, meningococcal) are not discussed. 522 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Information about the Meningococcal B Immunisation Programme (an epidemic programme between 2004 -2006) can be found in earlier editions of the Handbook . A1.3.1 Diphtheria -containing vaccines During the 1920s the Department of Health, at the instigation of individual school medica l officers or medical officers of health, began delivering diphtheria immunisations in a few selected schools and orphanages, but there was no national policy. By 1941 diphtheria immunisation was offered routinely to children aged under 7 years through the School Medical Service and the Plunket Society. From 1960 the Department of Health programme was delivered by GPs using three doses of non -adsorbed triple vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis vaccine, DTwP) at ages 3, 4 and 5 months, and a dose of double (diphtheria and tetanus, DT) vaccine before school entry at age 5 years. (For the history of the Schedule 's diphtheria toxoid -containing vaccine history after 1960, see '). A1.3.2 Hib-containing vaccines Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was a dded to the Schedule in January 1994, which meant that diphtheria, tetanus, whole -cell pertussis and Hib (DTwPH) vaccine replaced the diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine given at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months. A monovalent Hib vaccine was given at age 18 months, and a catch -up programme of a single dose of monovalent Hib vaccine was recommended for all children aged under 5 years (ie, those born from January 1989). From February 1996 the fourth dose was changed to age 15 month s and given as DTwPH to reduce the two immunisation events in the second year to one at age 15 months. DTwPH led to a more than 90 percent reduction in the number of invasive Hib cases in those aged under 5 years but resulted in an increase in the percent age of Hib cases occurring in those aged under 6 months, some of whom had received age -appropriate vaccination. When a supply issue resulted in a change of vaccine in 2000, the opportunity was taken to change to PRP -OMP (polyribosylribitol phosphate outer membrane protein, as Comvax, Hib -HepB combination), which offers substantial protection after a single dose. This vaccine was used until 2008, when a hexavalent vaccine containing PRP -T Hib component was introduced. This vaccine induces a minimal first -dose response, with some protection after the second dose. It was acknowledged that there was a risk that the change would result in an increase in cases aged under 6 months, but this risk was outweighed by the benefit of reducing the number of injections at each of the first three visits and the reduction in IPD with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 523 The Hib component of Infanrix -hexa, PRP -T, requires a primary course of three doses with a booster dose at age 15 months, though some protection is induced after the second dose. In 2006, Hib -PRP-T was funded for older children and adults pre - or post -splenectomy. In 2014 funding was extended to include other high -risk conditions. A1.3.3 Hepatitis B -containing vaccines HepB was added to the S chedule gradually, starting in September 1985, when it was offered to newborn babies of HBeAg -positive mothers. Three 10 \u00b5g doses of plasma - derived vaccine were given, as recommended by the manufacturer. In March, 1987 the immunisation programme was extend ed to newborns of all HBsAg -positive mothers and to children born in certain high -risk districts (Northland, Takapuna, Auckland, South Auckland, Rotorua, Napier and Gisborne). In 1988 a universal infant vaccination programme was introduced using four low doses (2 \u00b5g) of the plasma -derived vaccine H -B-Vax. A catch -up campaign for all preschoolers was undertaken in 1989, and household and sexual contacts of HBsAg -positive women identied during antenatal screening were also entitled to free immunisation. In December 1988 H -B-Vax was replaced by a recombinant vaccine, Engerix -B. This was given at the manufacturer 's recommended dose (10 \u00b5g) at 6 weeks, 3 months and 15 months of age. Babies of carrier mothers also received a dose of vaccine, pl us HBIG at birth. From February 1990 free hepatitis B immunisation was extended to all children aged under 16 years. In February 1996 the third dose of HepB was brought forward from 15 to 5 months of age to give early protection to infants and to complete the HepB schedule in the rst year of life, in the expectation that this would improve vaccine uptake. This schedule continues in 2020, with 10 \u00b5g given at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib (Infanrix -hexa). For infants born to HBsAg -positive mothers, an additional dose of HepB plus HBIG is given at birth. In 2014, HepB was made available to individuals at high risk of hepatitis B disease or its complications. In 2015, funding was extended to include other high -risk condition s. A1.3.4 HPV vaccines Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, using Gardasil, a vaccine containing virus -like particles (VLPs) derived from HPV types 16, 18, 6 and 11 (HPV4), began in New Zealand on 1 September 2008 and was initially offered only t o females born in 1990 and 1991. In 2009 the programme was extended to females born from 1992 onwards. In 2009 and 2010, HPV immunisation was offered through most participating schools to females in school years 8 -13. 524 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 From 2011 the HPV immunisation was on ly offered in participating schools to females in school year 8. HPV immunisation was also available through family doctors, local health centres and most Family Planning clinics for females who did not attend a participating school or who did not want to have it at school. In 2013 HPV vaccine was funded (for delivery in hospitals only) for other groups at risk of HPV -related disease; from 2014, high -risk groups have also been able to access HPV vaccine in primary care. In 2015, funding was extended to incl ude other high -risk conditions. Males became eligible for HPV vaccine in 2017, with funding extended to include all males and females aged 26 years and under. The nine -valent HPV vaccine (HPV9, Gardasil 9) replaced HPV4, and a two -dose schedule was recomm ended for immunocompetent children aged 9 -14 years. A1.3.5 Influenza vaccines Funded influenza immunisation was introduced in 1997 for people aged 65 years and older. From 1999 the vaccine became funded for younger people (aged from 6 months to 64 years) who were at increased risk of influenza complications. In 2010 funded vaccine was extended to pregnant women, and in 2013 to children aged under 5 years who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness or have a history of significant respiratory illness. In 2015 , funding was extended to include other high -risk conditions. In 2018, quadrivalent influenza vaccine replaced the previously used trivalent vaccine. A1.3.6 Measles -containing vaccines The measles vaccine was introduced in 1969 for children aged 10 months to 5 years who had not had measles, and for those aged under 10 years at special risk. In 1974 the recommended age for measles vaccine was changed from 10 months to 12 months, and in 1981 it was changed to age 12 -15 months. These changes attempted to achieve a b alance between too early immunisation, where the vaccine is neutralised by maternally acquired antibody, and the requirement to protect the very young during an epidemic. MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in 1990 to be given at age 12-15 months in place of the measles vaccine. The dose at age 11 years was introduced in 1992. In 1996 the timing of the rst dose of MMR was changed to age 15 months, to be given at the same time as the booster dose of diphtheria, tetanus, whole -cell pertu ssis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwPH) vaccine. At the start of the 1997 epidemic, the measles immunisation campaign, using MMR, targeted all children aged under 10 years. During the campaign, the recommended time for the rst dose was brought forw ard to age 12 months, and in Auckland a dose was recommended for children aged 6 -11 months, to be repeated at age 15 months. The national coverage achieved in the campaign is not known, but estimates for the school -aged population range from 55 percent for Auckland to 85 percent for the Wellington region. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 525 In 2001 the Schedule was changed to give the rst dose of MMR at age 15 months and the second dose at 4 years. There was a school catch -up programme for the second MMR dose for children aged 5 -10 years. This schedule of two doses of MMR at 15 months and 4 years continued. Vaccine -derived maternal antibody levels, which protect young infants, are lower and wane earlier than the antibody levels derived from natural infection. It is likely that in due cours e the age of the first dose of measles -containing vaccine will be changed to age 12 months. In 2014, MMR became available for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression (upon specialist advice). In 2020, the Schedule changed to recommend the first dose of MMR be given at 12 months and the second dose at 15 months. A1.3.7 Mumps -containing vaccines Mumps vaccine (as MMR) was introduced to the Schedule in 1990 for children aged 12-15 months. (See section A1.3.6 .) A1.3.8 Pertussis -containing vaccines A monovalent pertussis vaccine was introduced by the Department of Health in 1945, and from 1953 it was also available combined with the diphtheria and tetanus vaccine. Routine childhood immunisation began in 1960 using the plain (ie, no adjuvant, not adsorbed) diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis (DTwP) triple vaccine. Three doses were given, at ages 3, 4 and 5 months. In 1971 the policy was altered to two doses of adsorbed triple vaccine given at ages 3 and 5 months. It was believed efcacy would be unaltered and the risk of serious reactions would be reduced. Following this schedule change, there was a progressive increase in hospitalisation rates in 1974, 1978 and 1982. Review of the increase in hospitalisations led to the addition, in 1984, of a third dose of DTwP, given at age 6 weeks, to provide earlier protection. From 1994 whole -cell pertussis vaccine was administered as a quadrivalent vaccine wi th diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b - DTwPH). A fourth dose of pertussis vaccine was added in 1996 (as DTwPH vaccine), given at age 15 months, with the goals of increasing protection in young children and reducing risk of transmission to younger siblings. 526 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Acellular pertussis vaccine was introduced in August 2000, and diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) and DTaP/Hib replaced t he whole -cell pertussis vaccines. In February 2002 the vaccine given at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months was changed to DTaP with inactivated polio vaccine (DTaP -IPV), and a booster dose of DTaP -IPV was introduced and given at age 4 years to protect chi ldren during the early school years and to decrease transmission of the infection to younger children. In 2006 the timing of the booster components of the pertussis schedule was changed to extend vaccine -induced protection into adolescence. Following the three doses of a pertussis -containing vaccine in the rst year of life, booster doses are given at ages 4 and 11 years. Since March 2008 the acellular pertussis vaccine has been delivered as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib for the primary immunisation series, scheduled at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months; as DTaP -IPV at age 4 years; and as Tdap at age 11 years. In comparison with DTaP, Tdap contains smaller doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and the pertussis antigens. Since January 2013 pregnant women have been eligible for a booster dose of Tdap vaccine. Initially, this was under the outbreak policy and became part of high -risk funded vaccine criteria in July 2015. In 2014, pertussis -containing vaccines (as DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib, DTaP -IPV and Tdap) became available for (re)vaccination of children with certain high -risk conditions. This was extended to high -risk adults (as Tdap) in 2015. In 2019 eligibility for pregnant women was extended to include when given any time in their second or third trimester, with a recom mendation it be given from 16 weeks ' gestation every pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester. In 2020, Tdap replaced Td for adult vaccinations at age 45 years and 65 years. Tdap is only offered at age 45 years for those who had not previously had four tetanus containing vaccinations. A1.3.9 Pneumococcal vaccines The 7 -valent polysaccharide vaccine (23PPV, Pneumovax 23) were introduced in 2006 for high -risk individuals. PCV7 be came part of the Schedule in June 2008, with four doses recommended at ages 6 weeks, 3 months, 5 months and 15 months. In July 2011, the 10 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevenar 13) was introduced for some high -risk children. PCV13 replaced PCV10 on the Schedule in July 2014. In 2015, PCV13 became available for adults with certain high -risk conditions. PCV10 replaced PCV13 on the usual childhood schedule in July 2017, with PCV13 and 23PPV continuing for high -risk individuals. In July 2020, the PCV10 schedule changed to a two-dose primary plus booster given at 6 weeks, 5 months and 12 months. The PCV13 remained at a three -dose primary series plus booster for high risk individuals, ie given at 6 weeks, 3 months, 5 months and 12 months. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 527 A1.3.10 Poliomyelitis -containing vaccines Limited supplies of the Salk vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) became available in 1956, and immunisation initially targete d 8- and 9 -year-old children. As supplies improved, immunisation was extended to include all 5 -10-year-olds, then children aged 11 -15 years, with approximately 80 percent coverage. By 1960 immunisation was offered to everyone between 6 months and 21 years of age (with three doses of vaccine). The Sabin vaccine (oral polio vaccine, OPV) was introduced in August 1961, initially for children up to age 12 months; eight months later it was made available to all school children. On completion of this programme i n September 1962 the vaccine was offered to adolescents and adults. In 1967 OPV was given with diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine at ages 3, 4, 5 and 18 months. The deletion of the DTwP dose at age 4 months in 1971 meant the OPV d ose at age 4 months was also removed. An extra dose of polio vaccine was added at age 5 years in 1980, based on serological data, which showed decreased immunity to poliovirus types 1 and 3 in school entrants. In 1996, as part of the Schedule changes, the third dose of the primary series was moved back to the rst year of life, with OPV given at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months. The booster dose was moved to age 11 years, to be given at the same time as the MMR and adult tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vacc ines. In 2001 the Schedule was changed to give the fourth dose of OPV at age 4 years, at the same time as the second dose of MMR. Students aged 5 -10 years in 2001 who did not receive the fourth dose of polio vaccine at age 4 years were offered a dose at ag e 11 years. IPV replaced OPV in 2002 and was included in three doses of DTaP -IPV in the rst year of life, with a booster at age 4 years. Those children who had not received four doses of polio vaccine were offered IPV with Tdap, as Tdap -IPV (Boostrix -IPV) at age 11 years in 2006 and 2007. From 2008, Tdap has been offered at age 11 years, as all children should now have received four doses of polio vaccine by age 4 years. Combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated polio vaccine and Haemophilus on the Schedule in March 2008. In 2014, IPV vaccine became available for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression. vaccine (RV5, RotaTeq) was introduced to the Schedule in 2014, for infants at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months. In 2017, the two-dose monovalent vaccine (RV1, Rotarix) replaced RV5 on the Schedule, for infants at ages 6 weeks and 3 months. 528 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A1.3.12 vaccine (Cendehill strain) was rst offered to all 4-year-old New Zealand children in 1970, the rationale being to prevent transmission of the wild virus in 5 -9-year-old children, who were the main sufferers from clinical disease. At the same time, the Department of Health delivered a school - based programme, whic h succeeded in immunising 95 percent of children aged 5 -9 years. The acceptance rate of the preschool entry dose of rubella was only about 40 percent , and many practitioners did not feel it was appropriate to immunise males. In 1979 the immunisation polic y for rubella was altered to offer the vaccine to girls aged 11 years, in school year 7 (form 1). The aim was to immunise females before they attained childbearing age. In 1990 MMR was introduced at age 12 -15 months for all children, and rubella vaccine co ntinued to be offered to girls in school year 7. Since 1992 two doses of rubella vaccine - as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine - have been offered to all children, the rst dose in the second year of life and the second dose at age 11 years. This w as changed in 2001, maintaining the rst dose of MMR at age 15 months and changing the second to age 4 years. The aim of this strategy was to prevent rubella epidemics, reduce the background incidence of rubella and continue to protect women before childbe aring, therefore eventually eliminating CRS. In 2001 there was an MMR school catch -up programme throughout the country for all children aged 5 -10 years who would no longer receive an MMR dose in school year 7. The rubella schedule continued as two doses of MMR offered at ages 15 months and 4 years. In 2014, MMR became available for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression (upon specialist advice). In 2020, the Schedule changed to recommend the first dose of MMR be given at 12 months and the sec ond dose at 15 months (see section A1.3.6 ). A1.3.13 Tetanus -containing vaccines The history of tetanus vaccine use prior to the 1960 introduction of diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine is not well recorded, but tetanus vaccine was widely used in World War II and subsequently by the armed forces. In New Zealand, universal infant immunisation with tetanus toxoid began in 1960 with the use of three dose s of triple vaccine. Anyone born before 1960 is less likely to have received a primary series, unless they were in the armed forces. Older women appear to be at particular risk. The first scheduled vaccine used for infants (from 1960) was the DTwP vaccine , with three doses at monthly intervals at ages 3, 4 and 5 months, and a diphtheria and tetanus (DT) booster before school entry (at age 5 years). A DT booster at age 18 months was added in 1964, primarily to enhance protection against tetanus. There was a change to a more immunogenic adsorbed vaccine in 1971, and the dose given at age 4 months was dropped. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 529 In 1980 the dose of DT given at age 5 years was replaced by the monovalent tetanus toxoid given at age 15 years, as part of a move from 10 -yearly to 20 -yearly boosters for tetanus. It was considered that more frequent boosters were unnecessary and the cause of significant local reactions. There was a return to a three -dose primary series of DTwP (by the addition of a 6 -weeks -of-age vaccination) in 1984 b ecause two doses had been inadequate to control pertussis. In 1996 the booster of Td, which had been changed from tetanus toxoid in 1994 (see below), and previously given at age 15 years, was changed to age 11 years. In 2002 the primary schedule for tetan us, given in combination vaccines at ages 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months, followed by a dose at 15 months, was changed when a further dose was introduced at age 4 years. The Td given at age 11 years continued. Since 2006 the childhood schedule for tetanus has been given in combination vaccines at ages 6 weeks, 3 months, 5 months ( DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib ), 4 years (DTaP -IPV) and 11 years (Tdap). Td replaced the tetanus toxoid vaccine in 1994, and 10 -yearly boosters were recommended. The change was recommended to maintain the adult population 's immunity to diphtheria, in response to outbreaks overseas affecting adults and the absence of natural boosting because the disease had become rare. Since 2002 adult boosters have been recommended at ages 45 and 65 years (instead of 10 -yearly) as a pragmatic attempt to increase coverage in the adult population. In 2014, Td became available for (re)vaccination following immunosuppression. In 2020, Td was discontinued and replaced with Tdap for wound prophylaxis and adult booster doses. A Tdap dose is offered at 45 years, for adults who had not previously received four doses of a tetanus -containing vaccine, and at age 65 years. A1.3.14 BCG vaccines BCG immunisation was rst introduced to New Zealand in 1948 and later extende d to all adolescents. BCG immunisation of neonates was introduced in 1976, initially in districts with high rates of active TB. Universal screening and vaccination of 13 -year-olds was discontinued in the South Island in 1963, was phased out in regions of the North Island in the 1980s, and had ceased by 1990. It was stopped because TB had declined to a point at which the advantages of universal vaccination were outweighed by the disadvantages (cost, side - effects and reduced diagnostic value of th e Mantoux test). BCG vaccine is now only available to neonates and children aged under 5 years at high risk of TB. 530 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A1.3.15 Varicella vaccines In 2014 two doses of varicella vaccine (VV, Varilrix) were introduced for individuals at high risk of varicella infection . In 2017 one dose of VV was introduced to the Schedule at age 15 months (for children who were born on or after 1 April 2016). One catch -up VV dose was introduced for previously unvaccinated children turning 11 years old on or after 1 July 2017 who had no t previously had a varicella infection. A1.3.16 Herpes zoster vaccines ZV was introduced onto the Schedule on 1 April 2018, as a single dose for adults aged 65 years, with a catch -up programme for adults aged 66 -80 years inclusive (the catch -up programme ceases o n 31 December 202 1).

IMMUNISATION 2020 531 Appendix 2 immunisation catch -ups It is essential that vaccinators have a sound understanding of the number of antigens and the most effective spacing of doses required for a primary course and subsequent boosters in order to assess an individual 's immunisation requi rements. The principles described below will help vaccinators in this process. Section A2.2 discusses catch -up requirements for children aged under 18 years, and section A2.3 discusses the requirements for adults. Plan and document your complete catch -up schedule in the patient notes and recall system to ensure continuity of care. For assistance with planning catch -up schedules, contact your immunisation coordinator, call the IMAC freephone line on 0800 IMMUNE/0800 466 863, or discuss with an experienced colleague. A2.1 Eligibility for publicly funded vaccines The Health and Disability Services Eligibility Direction 2011 (the Eligibility Direction) issued by the Minister of Health sets out the eligibility criteria for publicly funded health and disability services, including National Immunisation Schedu le vaccines, in New Zealand. Only people who meet the eligibility criteria defined in the Eligibility Direction can receive publicly funded health and disability services. However, regardless of their immigration and citizenship status, all children aged under 18 years are eligible to receive Schedule vaccines, and providers can claim the immunisation benefit for administering the vaccines. A2.2 Planning catch -ups for infants, children and adolescents aged under 18 years When planning a catch -up schedule, start by focusing on the antigens already received and the additional antigens required, not the vaccine combinations available or trade names. There is no need to think in terms of events missed (eg, the 6 -week, 3 -month, 532 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 5-month, 12 -month or 15 -month vaccination events). It is important to note the age of the child when the antigens were received. Although catch -up tables are provided in this appendix, children may not fit these unless they are completely unvaccinated, o r there is no documented history and they are assumed to be unvaccinated. Trying to fit a child 's vaccine requirements to a table can result in too many or not enough antigens being administered. Use the following principles to establish what antigens the infant, child or adolescent requires. A2.2.1 Principles of catch -up for infants and children aged under 10 years 1. If the immunisation status of a child is uncertain or unknown, plan the catch -up schedule assuming the vaccines have not been given. 2. Administer catc h-up immunisations as per the New Zealand Schedule, not an overseas immunisation schedule. 3. The best approach is to ascertain the antigens required for the child 's current age, subtract any already given and then develop the individual 's catch -up schedule. 4. There is considerable flexibility when planning catch -up schedules. To offer the best protection in the shortest time possible, most vaccines can be given at the same visit, and the catch -up schedule shortened to four -weekly intervals to ensure the required number of doses are administered. 5. If the schedule has been interrupted, do not repeat prior doses regardless of how long ago the previous doses were given. Exceptions to this principle are the following vaccines given to children aged under 12 months: MMR or measles - containing vaccine (see point 9 below), Hib vaccine (see point 10), PCV (see point 11), and varicella vaccine (see point 12). 6. If a child infrequently attends general practice and failure to return for future immunisation is a concern, it is prudent to administer as many antigens as possible at every visit. 7. For infants and children aged under 10 years, use DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib or DTaP -IPV for primary immunisation. Tdap may be used as an alternative for primary immunisation of children aged 7 to under 18 years (note that Tdap (Boostrix) is not registered for primary immunisation , but there is no evidence of safety concerns). 8. The first dose of rotavirus vaccine (RV1, Rotarix) should be given before age 15 weeks (ie, the latest age is 14 weeks and 6 days), and the second dose administered a minimum of four weeks later. An infant who has not had the first dose before age 15 weeks will not be eligible to commence the rotavirus course. Where the first dose is inadvertently given at age 15 weeks or older, the remaining IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 533 dose should be given, but both doses should be given before age 25 weeks (ie, by age 24 weeks and 6 days). 9. From 1 October 2020, the first dose of MMR is scheduled at 12 months and the second dose of MMR at 15 months, or at least four weeks after the first MMR. MMR or any single -antigen measles vaccine given before age 12 months is not counted as part of the two -dose MMR schedule. 10. A single dose of Hib -PRP-T is required for all children aged 12 months to under 5 years regardless of the number of doses given in their first year. Children who receive catch -up DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib between 12 months to under 5 years do not require a single antigen Hib vaccine as this is covered by the combination vaccine. Healthy children aged 5 years and older do not need Hib -PRP-T. 11. For healthy infants commencing PCV10 vaccination under 12 months of age, a primary course is two doses with a minimum of eight weeks between doses. A booster dose is given eight weeks after the completion of the primary course. It may be given after at least four weeks if that coincides with the 12 -month immunisation event, to get them back on to schedule. Unimmunised healthy children aged 12 months to under 5 years require two PCV doses at least eight weeks apart. If a child did not complete their primary course when under 12 months of age, do not count the doses given prior to 12 months when determining the number of PCV10 catch -up doses required. Healthy children aged 5 years and older do not need PCV. See chapter 16 'Pneumococcal disease ' for PCV13 schedules for high -risk children. 12. One dose of varicella vaccine is funded at 15 months for children who were born on or after 1 Apr il 2016. A child who has received a non -funded varicella vaccine prior to 12 months is still eligible to receive the 15 -month funded vaccine. A child who has had varicella disease does not require the varicella vaccine. 13. Remember to check whether the infant /child has any specific health conditions that may make them eligible for additional vaccines or additional doses of vaccine (see chapter 4 'Immunisation of special groups '). 14. Once the child has received the appropriate vaccines for their age, they should continue with the Schedule as usual. Table A2.1 : Minim um number of antigens required, by age at time of presentation, for infants and children aged <10 years <12 months 12 months to <5 years 5 years to <10 years 3 DTaPa 3 or 4 DTaPa 4 DTaPa 3 IPVa e 3 or 4 IPVa,e 3 or 4 IPVe 3 HepBb 3 HepBb 3 3 (or DTaP -IPV) for the 3 -dose primary series (at a minimum of 4 -weekly intervals), then continue with the usual childhood schedule with a booster dose of DTaP -IPV given at age 4 years. If the child commences immunisation at age 4 years or older, give the booster dose at least 534 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 6 months after the 3rd dose of the primary series. A fourth DTP given earlier than 3 years of age on an overseas schedule is not counted as the 4 year dose. b. If the child received HepB at birth, they require a total of 4 HepB doses. Children born to HBsAg - positive mothers require serological test ing at age 9 months - see section 9.5.2. c. For healthy infants commencing PCV10 vaccination under 12 months of age, a primary course is 2 doses with a minimum of 8 weeks between doses. A booster dose is given 8 weeks after the completion of the primary course. It may be given after at least four weeks if that coincides with the 12 -month event, to get them back on to schedule. For healthy children aged 12 months to u nder 5 years who are commencing immunisation or with an incomplete course, 2 doses of PCV10 at least 8 weeks apart. (See chapter 16 'Pneumococcal disease ' for PCV13 schedules for high -risk children.) d. The first dose of rotavirus vaccine should be given before age 15 weeks (ie, the latest is 14 weeks and 6 days) and the second dose given a minimum of 4 weeks later. Both doses must be given before age 25 weeks (ie, the latest is 24 weeks and 6 days). Where the first dose is inadvertently given at age 15 weeks or older, the second dose should be given, but both doses must be given before age 25 weeks (ie, latest age 24 weeks and 6 days). e. A minimum of 3 polio doses are required for the primary series (at a minimum of 4 -weekly intervals) for children aged under 10 years, but 4 doses may be given when co mbination vaccines are used (eg, DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib or DTaP -IPV). For all infants and children who have had OPV (ie, either OPV or bOPV) a further dose of IPV should be administered even if they have completed a full OPV/bOPV course. f. A single dose of Hib -PRP is required for all children from age 12 months to under 5 years, regardless of the number of doses given before age 12 months. Children who receive catch -up DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib between 12 months to under 5 years do not require a single antigen Hib -PRP vaccine as this is covered by the combination vaccine. g. Children commencing immunisation at age 12 months or older require 1 dose of MMR, then continue the usual childhood schedule with a second dose of MMR given at age 15 months, or at least 4 weeks after the first MMR dose. h. One dose of varicella vaccine is funded for children born on or after 1 April 2016. Children who received a non -funded varicella vaccine prior to 12 months are still eligible to receive the funded 15 -month varicella vaccine. A chi ld who has had varicella disease does not require the varicella vaccine. A2.2.2 Principles of catch -up for children and adolescents aged 10 to under 18 years 1. The best approach is to ascertain the antigens required for current age, subtract any already given and then develop the individual 's catch -up schedule. 2. There is considerable flexibility when planning catch -up schedules. To offer the best protection in the shortest time possible, most vaccines can be given at the same visit and the catch -up schedule short ened to four -weekly intervals to ensure the required number of doses are administered. 3. If the Schedule has been interrupted, do not repeat prior doses regardless of how long ago the previous doses were given. 4. If the immunisation status of an individual is uncertain or unknown, plan the catch -up schedule assuming the vaccine has not been given. 5. If an individual infrequently attends general practice and failure to return for future immunisation is a concern, it is prudent to administer as many antigens as possible at every visit. MMR should be recommended at the first visit. 6. For individuals aged 10 years to under 18 years, Tdap is recommended and funded for primary and booster immunisation. While Tdap is not approved for use IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 535 (registered) as a primary course, n o safety concerns are expected when using Tdap for primary immunisation in individuals aged 10 to under 18 years. 7. For individuals aged 11 -15 years, an alternative two -dose hepatitis B catch -up schedule may be considered using Engerix B 20 \u00b5g, with the seco nd dose given four to six months after the first. 8. A two -dose schedule of HPV at least 6 -12 months apart is recommended for individuals who receive their first dose before their 15th birthday, even if they are 15 years or older at the time of the second dos e. Individuals who start their HPV schedule from age 15 years and older receive three doses of HPV at 0, 2 and 6 months. If required, a shortened schedule of three doses can be given over a 5-month period, with a minimum of four weeks between any two doses . Non-residents who were under age 18 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the course, even if they are aged 18 years or older when they complete it. See Table A2.9 for HPV catch -up schedules. 9. One dose of varicella vaccine is funded for children born on or after 1 July 2006, from age 11 years, who have not previously had varicella vaccination or infection . The appropriate varicella schedule for those ages 13 years or older when starting is two doses with a minimum of a four-week gap; however, only one dose is currently funded for those born on or after 1 July 2006. 10. Remember to also check whether the indivi dual has any specific health conditions that may make them eligible for additional vaccines or additional doses of vaccine (see chapter 4 'Immunisation of special groups '). 11. Once the individual has received the appropriate vaccines for their age, they should continue with the Schedule as usual.

Children who receive DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib between 12 months to under 5 years do not require a single antigen Hib -PRP as this is covered by the combination vaccine. b. Healthy children commencing immunisation at age 12 -23 months require 2 PCV doses, with a minimum interval of 8 weeks between doses. If the child did not complete a primary course of PCV when under 12 months of age, do not count the previously given doses when determining t he number of PCV catch -up doses required. If the child completed a primary course of PCV before age 12 months, give a booster dose from 12 months of age, at least 4 weeks after the completion of the primary course. (See chapter 16 'Pneumococcal disease ' for PCV13 schedules for high -risk children.) c. The first dose of MMR is scheduled at age 12 months, with a second dose given at 15 months or at least 4 weeks after the first dose. d.

If a shortened schedule is required for those aged 15 years or older, the 3 doses can be given over a 5-month period, with a minimum of 4 weeks between any two doses. A2.3 Immunisation catch -up for eligible adults aged 18 years and older When seen at general practice or by vaccination providers, adults should be checked to see that they ha ve received protection against the following diseases and have received a primary immunisation course as in Table A2.10 below. Adults are eligible for age-appropria te catch -up immunisations if they are New Zealand residents, citizens, former refugees or hold a visa which makes them eligible for health care in New Zealand. 1. If the requisite number of doses have not been received, catch -up vaccination is recommended. Th ere is flexibility when planning catch -up schedules. To offer the best protection in the shortest time possible, most vaccines may be given at the same visit and the catch -up schedule shortened to four -weekly intervals to ensure the required number of doses are administered. 2. Do not repeat prior doses regardless of how long ago the previous doses were given. 3. Adults should be reminded of the necessity for age -appropriate boosters for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis at 45 years of age if they have not previou sly received four tetanus vaccines in their lifetime, and for all adults at 65 years of age. 4. Pertussis (Tdap; given from 16 weeks ' gestation) and influenza vaccines are recommended and funded in every pregnancy. A single dose of unfunded Tdap and influenza vaccines may be considered for adults requesting pertussis and influenza protection, especially for those in close contact with young babies. 5. Women of childbearing age should know whether they are immune to rubella, and are considered immune if have two documented doses of MMR after 12 months of age. If the patient does not have documented evidence of immunity (see section 12.8.3 ), two doses of f unded MMR should be offered four weeks apart (MMR cannot be given in pregnancy and pregnancy should be avoided for four weeks following vaccination). If they have received one documented dose of MMR, a second dose should be administered. 6. Previously unvacci nated males and females aged 15 years to 26 years inclusive may receive three doses of HPV vaccine. Those who started with HPV4 may complete their remaining doses with HPV9. Those who were aged under 27 years when they commenced but did not complete HPV va ccination are funded to complete the three -dose course even if they are aged 27 years or older when they complete it. Non -residents who were under the age of 18 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are funded to complete the course, even if they are aged 18 years or older when they complete it. 540 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 7. One dose of ZV (zoster vaccine) is funded for individuals who turn age 65 years on or after 1 April 2018. There is a catch -up programme for those age 66 to 80 years inclusive, this catch -up programme ends 31 December 202 1. 8. Check whether the individual has any additional immunisation requirements, such as specific health conditions or occupational risk (see chapter 4 'Immunisation of special groups '). Table A2.10 : Primary immunisation requirements for adults Antigens and number of doses required 3 Tdapa 3 polio (IPV)b 2 MMRc 3 HPVd,e (aged 26 years and under) a. A primary course of 3 doses of Tdap vaccines (at a minimum of 4 -weekly intervals) is recommended and funded for unimmunised or partially immunised adults. At age 45 years, the Tdap is recommended for those adults who have not previously received four tetanus containing vaccines in their lifetime, and for all adults at age 65 years . b. A primary course of 3 polio (IPV) doses (at a minimum of 4 -weekly intervals) is recommended and funded for unimmunised or partially immunised adults. c. Two doses of MMR (given a minimum of 4 weeks apart) are recommended and funded for unimmunised adults who are susceptible to any one of the three diseases. Those born in New Zealand before 1969 are considered immune to measles and thos e born prior to 1980 are considered to be immune to mumps. d. HPV9 vaccine is recommended and funded for individuals aged up to 26 years inclusive. Give the 3-dose course at 0, 2 and 6 months. If a shortened schedule is required, the 3 doses can be given o ver a 5-month period, with a minimum of 4 weeks between any two doses. e. Those who were under age 27 years when they commenced HPV vaccination are currently funded to complete the 3 -dose course, even if they are aged 27 years or older when they complete i t.

IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 541 Appendix 3 : Immunisation standards for vaccinators and guidelines for organisations offering immunisation services A3.1 Purpose The 'Immunisation standards for vaccinators ' (see section A3.3) are quality level s all vaccinators should achieve to ensure they can competently deliver safe and effective immunisation services. The 'Immunisation standards for vaccinators ' and the 'Guidelines for organisations storing vaccines and/or offering immunisation services ' (see section A3.4) apply to all vaccinators, including those delivering National Immunisation Schedule vaccines, vaccines on an authorised programme o r privately purchased vaccines including travel vaccines. The Schedule aims to protect children and adults against 15 serious vaccine - preventable diseases and offers publicly funded immunisation to individuals at risk of hepatitis A, influenza, varicella, TB, meningococcal and/or pneumococcal disease. Note: The term 'vaccinator ' used throughout these standards applies to any health professional offering a vaccinator service, including registered nurse vaccinators, authorised vaccinators, pharmac ist vaccinators, GPs and midwives. For the purposes of this appendix the term pharmacist vaccinator refers to both registered pharmacist and registered intern pharmacist who have met the educational and clinical requirements: although the scope of vaccines they can administer is different, the process they undergo to gain vaccinator status is the same. 542 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A3.2 Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights) Regulations 1996 It is expected that all organisations and pro viders offering immunisation services practise in accordance with the Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights) Regulations 1996. The Regulations establish the rights of consumers and the obligations and duties of providers to comply with the Code of Rights made pursuant to the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994. The obligation under the Regulations is to take 'reasonable actions in the circumstances to give effect to the rights and comply with t he duties ' in the Code of Rights. The Code of Rights is as follows. Right 1: Right to be treated with respect Right 2: Right to freedom from discrimination, coercion, harassment and exploitation Right 3: Right to dignity and independence Right 4: Right to services of an appropriate standard Right 5: Right to effective communication Right 6: Right to be fully informed Right 7: Right to make an informed choice and give informed consent Right 8: Right to support Right 9: Rights in respect of teaching or research Right 10: Right to complain For more detailed information on the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers ' Rights, refer to the Health and Disability Commissioner 's website (www.hdc.org.nz ). A3.3 Immun isation standards for vaccinators Standard 1: The vaccinator is competent in all aspects of the immunisation technique and has the appropriate knowledge and skills for the task Required characteristics of the vaccinator 1.1 The vaccinator completes an appropriate training programme approved by the Ministry of Health. If a vaccinator is working as an authorised vaccinator or as a IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 543 pharmacist vaccinator, they will also have undertaken a clinical assessment and vaccinate in accordance with their Scope of Practice (see Appendix 4 ). 1.2 All vaccinators are required to have a summary1 of their immunisation practice over the past 12 months. 1.3 The vaccinator remains current with developments in imm unisation theory, practice , cultural competency, and policy. At least every two years the vaccinator is required to have completed a vaccinator update course that meets the current Vaccinator Update Course Standards (published by IMAC) and have evidence of completion. 1.4 The vaccinator maintains linkages w ith other providers associated with immunisation delivery; for example, immunisation coordinators, outreach immunisation providers , Mori and Pacific health providers, and their local DHB NIR team. 1.5 Vaccinators are recommended to carry indemnity insurance f or their personal/professional protection. Standard 2: The vaccinator obtains informed consent to immunise Required characteristics of the vaccinator 2.1 The vaccinator is able to assess the knowledge of the individual/ parent/guardian regarding vaccine -preventable diseases and the process of immunity, and is able to provide evidence -based information to enable individuals/parent/guardian to make an informed choice and give informed consent. 2.2 The vaccinator communicates in a form, language and culturally appropriate way that enables the individual/parent/guardian to understand the information provided. Communication should be supported by evidence -based health information material (see section 2.1.2). 2.3 The vaccinator allows time to answer questions and obtains feedback indicating that the individual/parent/guardian understands which vaccine is being recommended and why. 2.4 The vaccinator informs the individual/par ent/guardian about the NIR, including information on the use and disclosure of the information held on the NIR, how the information is stored, and that all vaccinations given will be recorded on the NIR (if applicable) unless the individual/parent/guardian chooses to opt off the NIR. If an individual/parent/guardian chooses to opt off the NIR, this process must be explained to them. 2.5 Consent does not need to be given in writing (except for school -based immunisation programmes and BCG vaccination), but the va ccinator must document in the clinical notes a summary of the discussion and note that verbal consent was obtained. 2.6 The vaccinator obtains consent for each immunisation episode and documents that the individual/parent/guardian has been made aware of the be nets and risks of 1 The summary should include type of immunisation practice as a vaccinator (eg, general practice, occupational health, etc); types of vaccinations given (eg, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal); responsibilities related cold chain -designated person, etc). 544 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 the disease and the vaccine in order to make an informed choice about immunisation and the immunisation programme, including the NIR (see section 2.3.5). 2.7 If the individual/parent/guardian declines to be immunised/to immunise their child, the vaccinator provides information about keeping themselves and others healthy. The individual/parent/guardian should be advised that they can reconsider their dec ision at any time, and the declined immunisation will be offered again by their health provider. Standard 3: The vaccinator provides safe immunisation Required characteristics of the vaccinator and immunisation setting 3.1 The venue provides privacy and is appropriate fo r the individual/parent/guardian /whnau . Facilities are available for assessment and management of adverse events, including anaphylaxis (see section 2.3.3). 3.2 If the venue is a non -clinical setting (eg, in a home, workplace , marae or school) then a minimum of two immunisation team members must be present for vaccination; one of whom must be an authorised vaccinator or pharmacist vaccinator, the other must be a comp etent adult who is able to call for emergency support and has a current basic life support certificate. 3.3 The vaccinator can manage AEFIs, including anaphylaxis, ensures that they have onsite access to the minimum set of emergency equipment (see Table 2.12 in chapter 2), and has a contingency plan for seeking emergency assistance. 3.4 Because of the potential for anaphylactic reactions, vaccine recipient (with their parents/guardians if applicable) are required to remain under observation for a minimum of 20 minutes after immunisation. 3.5 The vaccinator ensures continuity of the cold chain and adheres to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) and the practice/clinic cold chain management policy. The vaccinator ensures the practice/clinic achieves Cold Chain Accreditation.1 3.6 Before vaccinating, the vaccinator undertakes an appropriate clinical assessment (pre-vaccination screen) (see section 2.1.3). 3.7 The vaccinator uses clean techniques in the preparation and administration of all vaccines (see section 2.1 and Appendix 7 ), visually checks the vaccine, checks expiry date, prepares vaccine as appropriate and uses vaccines within the recommended period after preparation. 3.8 The vaccinator provides verbal and written information that is evidence based and follows be st practice principles about care after immunisation (see sections 2.1.2 and 2.3.1). 1 Refer to the National Immunisation Programme cold chain management (available The vaccinator documents information on the vaccine(s) administered, and maintains pati ent condentiality Required characteristics of the vaccinator 4.1 The vaccinator has had training in the correct use of their PMS, the SBVS or the NIR manual forms to enable them to correctly enter an individual 's information on the NIR (if applicable) and to claim an immunisation benefit (if applicable). 4.2 The vaccinator documents the individual 's personal details, including NHI number, name, date of birth, ethnicity, address, contact telephone number, next of kin details and primary health care provider (if the vaccinator is not the usual primary health care provider). 4.3 Having chosen the appropriate immunisation schedule, the vaccinator documents the following details: consent obtained date vaccine administered vaccine type and number in the series batch number and expiry date injection site (eg, 'right deltoid ' not 'upper arm ') needle length that the patient was observed for 20 minutes post -vaccination if the vaccine was given by a non -standard route (the reasons must be documented) the immunisation event in the child 's Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book (if applicable) the date for the next immunisation in the child 's Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book (if applicable) advice and resources given. 4.4 The vaccinator ensures the immunisation information is sent to the NIR (ie, electronically or manually) where applicable, unless the individual/parent/guardian has opted off the collection of their/their child 's immunisation information on the NIR. 4.5 The vaccinator ensures the immunisation certicate (see Appendix 5 ) is accurately completed following the 15 -month and 4 -year immunisation events. 4.6 If the practice/clinic is not the usual primary health care provider, then t he individual 's primary health care provider is informed by the vaccinator or by NIR notification within five working days of giving the vaccine, unless the individual declines for this to occur. 4.7 All clinical documentation is appropriately managed and stor ed to maintain condentiality, and is made available to the individual/parent/guardian on request. 546 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Standard 5: The vaccinator administers all vaccine doses for which the vaccine recipient is due at each visit and only follows true contraindications Required characteristics of the vaccinator 5.1 The vaccinator adheres to the National Immunisation Schedule and delivers all the immunisations recommended for that visit, unless the individual/parent/guardian does not consent to this. 5.2 When catch -up immunisation is requ ired, this is planned with the minimum number of visits/injections and in conjunction with the individual/parent/guardian. 5.3 A dose of vaccine is deferred or avoided only when contraindicated or the individual/parent/guardian has chosen to defer/avoid it. Th e reason for deferral or avoidance must be documented (see section 2.1.4 and the specic disease chapters ). Standard 6: The vaccinator reports AEFIs promptly, accurately and completely Required characteristics of the vaccinator 6.1 All serious or unexpected AEFIs are reported by the vaccinator to the Medical Assessor, CARM (see section 1.6.3 for the adverse event reporting process ) and to the individual 's primary health care provider (if the vaccinator is another person). If the individual/parent/guardian does not consent to being identied, the report should be made without pe rsonal identication. 6.2 The vaccinator informs the individual/parent/guardian that if an adverse event occurs, they can also report it to CARM. 6.3 When a CARM report is received, and further doses of the vaccine have been contraindicated, the vaccinator advises the local DHB NIR Administrator so that an appropriate AEFI code is recorded in the individual 's NIR record. 6.4 The vaccinator seeks specialist (eg, GP, paediatrician, infectious diseases physician or medical ofcer of health) opinion if uncertain about the safety of further doses, and referral is made to secondary care if required. 6.5 The vaccinator ensures the adverse event, and any subsequent decisions relating to the event, are effectively communicated to the individual/parent/guardian and clearly documented in the child 's Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book (if applicable) and in the patient records, and appropriate follow -up is carried out. A3.4 Guidelines for organisations storing vaccines and/or offering immunisation services These guidelines apply to all organisations that store vaccines and/or offer immunisation services, including (but not limited to) general practices, public health IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 547 units, community pharmacies, travel clinics, occupational health clinics, emergency medical services, research units and h ospital wards/clinics/departments/pharmacies. The organisation that employs vaccinators to offer immunisation services has links to primary health care and to Well Child Tamariki Ora providers Required characteristics Immunisation is not delivered in isolation, but as an integrated part of primary health care services, including Well Child Tamariki Ora for children. If possible, at the time of immunisation, the organisation undertakes other health promotion and/or disease prevention activ ities as applicable, such as the Well Child National Schedule or Care Plus. Immunisation events, childhood and adult, are well communicated to other health services linked to the individual (eg, primary health care, outreach immunisation services, pharmac ies, occupational health). The organisation achieves high immunisation coverage of its population Required characteristics The organisation has an effective, secure, NHI -based system for recording and reporting immunisations and identifying individuals re quiring immunisation. Respecting the individual 's/parent 's/guardian 's rights to make an informed choice, the organisation takes all steps to ensure that an individual 's immunisation schedule commences on time and that subsequent events are administered on the due date. The organisation has electronic linkage to the NIR for registration and immunisation event notication, and the NIR is used to assist with follow -up. If electronic linking is not available, manual processes must be used. The organisation has a robust reminder (pre -call) system which encourages the delivery of on -time immunisation and timely follow -up for overdue immunisation. The organisation has an effective communication strategy to target high -needs population groups. Attendance at the practice/organisation is used as an opportunity to remind individuals/parents/guardians of the importance of immunisation and, if appropriate, to check and offer to bring up to date the individual 's immunisation status. Those who do not res pond to recall and who have not declined to take part are referred to the outreach immunisation service, as per local protocol. 548 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 The organisation supports vaccinators and NIR administrators Required characteristics The organisation has comprehensive immuni sation -related policies based on best practice, informed consent, the vaccination process and management of adverse events. The organisation uses a pharmaceutical refrigerator to store vaccines, has a vaccine cold chain policy in place and meets the requi rements outlined in the National Standard for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition)1 for all areas within the organisation storing vaccines. The organisation provides training and support workers (eg, kaiwhina, community health workers) for vaccinators working in the community. The organisation supports the need for vaccinators to have access to ongoing education and training on all aspects of immunisation at least every two years and when there are changes to the Schedule. The organisation provides initial and ongoing training and support specific to the NIR, PMS, and/or the SBVS (if applicable). The service is readily available, with no barriers to access Required characteristics No fee is charged to the individual/guardian for the immunisations that are on the Schedule or high -risk programmes (or for completing the child 's immunisation certicate). Regardless of their immigration and citizenship status, all children aged under 18 years are eligible to rec eive funded Schedule vaccines, and providers may claim the immunisation benefit for these children. Non -residents who were under age 18 years when they commenced HPV vaccination in New Zealand are currently funded to complete the course, even if they are a ged 18 years or older when they complete it. Further information on eligibility can be found on the Ministry of Health website (www .health.govt.nz/eligibility ). Immunisations are provided to both enrolled and casual patients at all times when the organisation or service is open. A person 's immunisation status is checked at each visit to the service. The organisation is culturally appropriate (ie, all health workers are assessed as culturally comp etent, reflect the populations they serve and offer a range of health information resources2 in different languages). 1 Refer to the National Immunisation Programme cold chain management (available H ealth immunisation resources are available in English and a variety of languages from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ) or from the local health education authorised provider.

The Director -General of Health or a medical ofcer of health may authorise any person to administer a vaccine (which is a prescription medicine) for the purposes of an approved immunisation programme.2 Clause 44A(2) stipulates that the per son seeking approval must apply in writing to the Director -General or a medical ofcer of health and provide documentary evidence that they: 1. can carry out basic emergency techniques, resuscitation and the treatment of anaphylaxis 2. have knowledge of the safe and effective handling of immunisation products and equipment 3. can demonstrate clinical interpersonal skills 4. have knowledge of the relevant diseases and vaccines to be able to explain the vaccination to the individual, parent or guardian of the individual who is to consent to the vaccination on behalf of the individual, to ensure that the individual or parent or guardian of the individual can give informed consent to the vaccination. The usual protocol requires authorised vaccinator applications to be subm itted to a medical officer of health in the applicant 's local region. Any authorisation given under subclause (2) of the Regulation is valid for a period of two years from the date of initial vaccinator training course (VTC) and is subject to such conditio ns as the Director - General or the medical ofcer of health thinks fit. However a s part of the COVID -19 response all authorised vaccinators and provisional authorised vaccinators are approved to provide National Immunisation Schedule and funded vaccinations for 1 Authorised vaccinators were previously called 'authorised independent vaccinators'. 2 See the Ministry of Health document Definition of an Approved Immunisation Programme (available for 552 increased risk of vaccine -preventable disease (as identified in the Immunisation Handbook) by the Director of Public Health . This means they do not need to apply for authorisation in different PHU areas. Successful applicants will be authoris ed to administer either all or specic vaccines as recommended in the current Handbook1 and any other vaccine as authorised by a medical ofcer of health. Pharmacist vaccinators A number of vaccines have been reclassified by the Medicines Classification Committee, from prescription medicines to restricted medicines when administered by a registered pharmacist or registered intern pharmacist who has successfully completed a VTC approved by the Ministry of Health and is complying with the immunisation stand ards of the Ministry of Health. For the purposes of this appendix the term pharmacist vaccinator refers to both registered pharmacists and registered intern pharmacists who have met the educational and clinical requirements. Although the scope of vaccines they can administer is different, the process they undergo to gain vaccinator status is the same. The reclassification means that pharmacists and pharmacist interns are able to administer specific vaccines if they have: successfully completed a Ministry of Health - approved VTC (including the open -book assessment) and clinical assessment, and are complying with the immunisation standards and guidelines as described in Appendix 3 of this Handbook. Pharmacist and intern pharmacist vaccinators are expected to be aware of which vaccines have been reclassified for their scope. Under the vaccine reclassification, pharmacist vaccinators are not required to apply to a medical officer of health for authorised vaccinator status for vaccines that have been reclassified. Pharmacist and intern pharmacist should notify Pharmaceutical Society of New Zealand (PSNZ) when they have completed the requirements specified above, inc luding the course completion date. Vaccinator status is valid for two years from the date of the initial VTC, once all the requirements are met. (For details of provisional authorised vaccinator status see section A4.1.4 ). 1 See the 'Introduction ' chapter in this Handbook or www.health.govt.nz/our -work/preventative - health -wellness/immunisation for more information about the National Immunisation Schedule . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 553 A4.1.2 Process for all vaccinators To achieve vaccinator status, all applicants must first meet the following requirements. 1. Demonstrate that within the preceding 24 months they have attended, completed and passed a VTC and have received a vaccinator training certificate. The VTC must meet the current Vaccinator Training Course Standards (published by IMAC) and the course should consist of: a. a minimum of 16 hours ' educational input b. a written open -book assessment (minimum one -hour duration), which may be oral at the facilitator 's discretion. 2. Undergo an independent clinical assessment by an immunisation coordinator or an approved assessor (as agreed by the medical offic er of health) .1 Information about the practice environment, including cold chain and emergency management processes, will be collected at the time of the clinical assessment. 3. Have evidence that they hold a current practising certificate from their registr ation authority (eg, Nursing Council of New Zealand, Pharmacy Council of New Zealand). 4. Have a current cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) certificate (see section A4.2 for details). Authorised vaccinators Authorised vaccinator applicants2 who have successfully completed their clinical assessment will then need to apply for authorisation by submitting an application, including the documentation described above, to t heir local medical officer of health (as part of the COVID -19 response, vaccinators are approved to vaccinate nationally and are approved by the Director of Public Health). Pharmacist vaccinators Pharmacists and intern pharmacists who have completed the t heoretical and clinical assessments should notify the Pharmaceutical Society (PSNZ) by an email containing the following information: 1. full name 2. membership number 3. name of the pharmacy or pharmacies which vaccinations will be provided from, or if the pharmacist is a locum 4. date of the course 5. date of their clinical assessment. 1 If it has been more than 12 months but less than 24 months since the applicant completed a full VTC, they should complete an online update prior to the clinical assessment. 2 Authorised vaccinators will not be able to vaccinate without a prescription or standing order until they have completed all the required processes. 554 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Copies of the vaccination certificate or resuscitation certificates are not required. Emails should be sent to p.society@psnz.org.nz and need to include 'pharmacist vaccinator ' in the subject line. It is recommended that all pharmacist vaccinators keep a copy of their record of their vaccinator training and other requirem ents in a file at the pharmacy for audit purposes. A4.1.3 Additional endorsement process for BCG vaccinators All BCG authorised vaccinators with BCG endorsement. They are authorised by the local medical officer of health as described below. New BCG vaccinators and gazetted BCG vaccinators seeking regional BCG endorsement To be endorsed as a BCG vaccinator, the applicant needs to: 1. complete an approved VTC 2. be nominated by their employer to become a BCG vaccinator 3. successfully complete a Ministry of Health -approved online BCG vaccination course 4. complete under clinical supervision a minimum of five BCG vaccinations (using a standing order or prescription) 5. successfully complete a BCG clinical assessment by an approved BCG assessor 6. apply to the medical officer of health for BCG endorsement approval, providing documented evidence of these requirements. If a BCG vaccinator needs to administer additional Schedule vaccines, they will need to undertake a clinical assessment appropriate for the age group they will be vaccinating. Standing orders or prescriptions are required for the clinical assessment process. For more information, see the Ministry of Health webpage BCG vaccine and vaccinator endorsement vaccinator status To renew BCG endorsement, vaccinators must apply to their local medical officer of health prior to the expiry date and provide documented evidence that they: 1. are a current authorised vaccinator, and 2. have completed an online vaccination course that includes an update on BCG. Note: BCG vaccinators must complete a BCG Vaccinator Update course every two years. This online course is available as part of IMAC education (available at www.immune.org.nz/health -professionals/education -training provisional authorised vaccinators In April 2020, as part of the New Zealand COVID -19 response, a pathway to provisional authorisation for vaccinators (PAV) was developed. This is a short -term measure with the Provisional Vaccinator Training Course being available through to April 2021. To achieve provisional authorised vaccinator status, v accinators are required to: 1. complete the online provisional vaccinator training course (including learning assessment and webinar) 2. successfully complete a peer assessment of clinical practice 3. hold a current Annual Practising Certificate 4. have evidence of cu rrent CPR certificate (see section A4.2 for details) 5. submitted completed applications for provisional authorised vaccinator approval to IMAC to be approved by the D irector of Public Health 6. on approval, provisional authorised vaccinators send copy of authorisation and peer assessment to the local immunisation coordinator. Provisional authorised vaccinators who wish to continue to vaccinate after June 2022 will be required to transition to become a fully authorised vaccinator or pharmacist vaccinator. Those who need to be approved as full authorised vaccinators or pharmacist vaccinators prior to June 2022 wi ll be required to complete a full VTC. A4.1.5 Process for two -yearly renewal of all vaccinators Authorised vaccinator or pharmacist vaccinator status is valid for two years from the date of the initial VTC. To maintain status as a vaccinato r this must be renewed two yearly. The vaccinator must meet the requirements specified below. To renew their vaccinator status, all vaccinators are required to: 1. during the past two years or within a month of expiry of status, have completed a vaccinator u pdate course that meets the current Vaccinator Update Course Standards1 2. have a summary of their immunisation practice over the past 12 months. The summary should include type of immunisation practice as a vaccinator (eg, general practice, occupational health, etc); types of vaccinations given (eg, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal); responsibilities related to immunisation (eg, cold chain -designated person, etc) 3. have evidence of a current practising certificate 4. have evidence of a current CPR certificate (see section A4.2 for details). 1 Authorised vaccinators will not be able to vaccinate without a prescription or standing order until they have completed all the required processes. 556 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Authorised vaccinators Prior to the expiry of their authorised vaccinator status, authorise d vaccinators are required to apply for renewal of their authorisation to their local medical officer of health and submit all relevant documentation (ie, immunisation update, CPR certificates and immunisation summary). Pharmacist vaccinators Prior the expiry of their pharmacist vaccinator status, pharmacist vaccinators should notify PSNZ when they have completed the requirements specified above. A4.1.6 Process when vaccinator status has not been maintained or has not been achieved If it is less than five yea rs since the vaccinator attended and completed an approved vaccinator training course When a vaccinator has not achieved or maintained their vaccinator status, they must: 1. have a clinical assessment by an immunisation coordinator or approved assessor within the past three months (only required if vaccinator status expired more than a month earlier) 2. have completed a vaccinator update course that meets the current Vaccinator Update Course Standards in the last two years 3. have a summary of their immunisation pra ctice over the past 12 months or intended area of practice. The summary should include type of immunisation practice as a vaccinator (eg, general practice, occupational health, vaccinations given (eg, responsibilities related to immunisation (eg, cold chain -designated person) 4. have evidence of a current practising certicate 5. have evidence of a current CPR certifi cate (see section A4.2 for details). If it is five or more years since the applicant completed an approved vaccinator training and they have not achieved or maintai ned their vaccinator status If it is more than five years since the applicant completed their initial VTC, they will be required to attend, complete and pass another VTC. This is because there will have been signicant developments in vaccination delivery in the intervening interval. See section A4.1.2 : Process for all vaccinators . IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 557 A4.1.7 Process when a vaccinator is new to the health district in which they intend to practise If an authorised vaccinator wishes to practise in another health district and/or public health area, they must advise the local medical officer of health and send through a copy of their current authorisation. Pharmacist and intern pharmacist vaccinators are required to advice the local immunisation coordinator of their intention to set up a new pharmacist vaccinator service; this is to ensure that the coordin ator is aware of which pharmacies require three -yearly spatial logging of the refrigerator. Where a vaccination services is already being offered this is not required. A4.2 Resuscitation requirements for all authorised vaccinators and pharmacist vaccinators All vaccinators, by virtue of their occupation, need to be able to resuscitate patients and therefore need to achieve and maintain the following resuscitation skills: 1. infant, child and adult CPR, including mouth -to-mouth, mouth -to-mask and the management of choking 2. administration of IM adrenaline for treatment of anaphylaxis 3. use of an automated external defibrillator 4. one- and two -person bag valve mask ventilation and mouth -to-mask technique. Resuscitation training for all vaccinators should cover the specific skills outlined above. The use of oxygen, sizing of airways, insertion of intravenous lines and the preparation of emergency medications (except for intramuscular adrenaline) are not skills specifically required of a vaccinator. All vaccinators m ust demonstrate/validate their resuscitation certification every two years. (Note: employer protocols may require this more frequently.) All vaccinators need to be able to administer intramuscular adrenaline in the event of an anaphylactic reaction to an immunisation event (see section 2.3.3). 558 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 All vaccinators must meet the emergency equipment and management requirements, regardless of the immunisation setting (eg, in general practice and in non -clinical settings, such as homes, schools, rest homes, workplaces and pharmacies), as listed in section 2.3.3. All vaccinators are ex pected to keep up to date with any guidance changes, including infection control and requirements for PPE. A4.3 Local immunisation programmes Medical Officers of Health may approve additional vaccinations (funded or unfunded) for authorised vaccinators to admi nister either as part of the standard authorisation process or as part of a local immunisation programme. Public health units (PHU) need to maintain a register of the authorised vaccinators in their region. Temporary authorised vaccinators can be added to approve local immunisation programmes by Medical Officers of Health. As part of the COVID -19 response all authorised vaccinators and temporary authorised vaccinators are approved to provide National Immunisation Schedule and funded vaccinations for those at increased risk of vaccine -preventable disease (as identified in the Immunisation Handbook) by the Director of Public Health . This means they do not need to apply for authorisation in different PHU areas. A4.4 Minimum staff and equipmen t requirements for vaccination services All vaccinators providing immunisation services need to have a minimum of two people present, one of whom must be an authorised vaccinator or pharmacist vaccinator; the other must be a competent adult who is able to call for emergency support and has a basic life support certificate. The following check list contains the emergency equipment that is required when vaccinating offsite. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 559 Check list of Emergency Equipment required for off -site vaccinations Ofce use only 1. Equipment The following should be available: Emergency kit containing: - adrenaline 1:1000 (minimum of 3 amp oules) - syringes (1 mL), 25 mm needles for IM injection (minimum of six) - adrenaline IM dose chart (ideally laminated) - cotton wool balls, gauze cellphone or phone access sharps box bag valve mask resuscitator (eg, Ambu bag) suitable for the population being vaccinated pen and paper for emergency use appropriately sized syringes and needles for specific vaccine programme cotton wool balls, ga uze, surgical tape or plasters vaccines cold chain equipment as required by the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) (see link in note below)a data logger with a probe, external display and alarm1 vomit bowl tissues gloves appropriate surface cleaner approved biohazard bag Yes / No 2. Optional additional emergency equipment an oxygen cylinder, flow meter, tubing and paediatric/adult masks airways - infant through to adult blood pressure monitoring equipment thermometer Intravenous cannula and administration sets: intravenous fluids hydrocortisone for injection saline flush Yes / No a. Consider using a secondary back -up device in case the data logger gets damaged. See the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2017 (2nd edition) (Immunisation) Regulations 1995 require parents/guardians of ch ildren born from 1 January 1995 to show their child 's immunisation certificate when these children start at an early childhood service and on entry to primary school (school year 1). The immunisation certicate shows whether a child is fully immunised or n ot. Information must be recorded at age 15 months when the early childhood vaccinations are complete, and after the immunisations at age 4 years. For those parents/guardians who decline to have their child vaccinated, the immunisation certicate may be completed at any time, but the completed immunisation certificate must still be shown when the child starts at an early childhood service or primary school. A5.2 Parent/guardian responsibilities Parents or guardians can choose whether to vaccinate their child, but they must show the immunisation certificate when their child starts at an early childhood service and on school entry, regardless of the child 's immunisation status. A5.3 Vaccinator responsibilities When completing and signing the immunisation certi ficate, vaccinators should be condent that a child is fully vaccinated. The primary concern is the child 's protection. If the previous vaccination history is uncertain and parents/guardians do not wish their child to be vaccinated, the child should be cer tied as 'not fully immunised '. Children who have not received the necessary doses of a vaccine or have no evidence of laboratory -proven disease should be recorded as 'not fully immunised '. The immunisation certicate is included in the Well Child Tamarik i Ora My Health Book . This book also contains the record of the child 's vaccinations. Vaccinators should ensure they record vaccination and other relevant health information in this book. This becomes particularly important if the child sees different heal th professionals. If the child 's book is lost, it should be replaced. Copies of the Well Child Tamariki Ora My Health Book and immunisation certicate pads can be obtained from the authorised provider of health education materials, usually the local public health service, or ordered from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 561 A5.4 Early childhood services and school responsibilities All early childhood services and primary schools, including khanga reo, indepen dent schools and kura kaupapa Mori, must keep an immunisation register for children born from 1 January 1995. The register is a tool to help reduce the spread of vaccine - preventable diseases in early childhood services and schools, as well as in the wider community. Registers are available from the authorised provider of health education materials or from the HealthEd website ( www.healthed.govt.nz ). The early childhood service or school has the responsibility to : advise the child 's parent/guardian that an immunisation certificate is required ensure the parent or guardian is asked to provide the immunisation certificate record the information from the immunisation certicate (or the fact that it was not shown) on the register advise the parent/guardian that a GP, practice nurse or public health nurse can help them to get an immunisation certicate if they do not have one. 562 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Appendix 6 : Passive immunisation A6.1 Introduction Passive immunisation involve s administering pre -formed antibody as human immunoglobulin to a recipient who is thought to have either no natural immunity to one or more infections, or who has impaired antibody production. CSL Behring Australia is the primary manufacturer of immunoglob ulin products for the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS). These products are prepared by fractionating large pools of plasma collected from blood donors. The immunoglobulin products available in New Zealand are usually derived from voluntary, unpaid New Zea land donors who are in good health and who do not have any conditions identiable by the standard questionnaire that all blood donors complete or by the mandatory testing for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis on each donation. Blood donations are only used if the tests show no evidence that these infections are present. Similar screening standards apply to the manufacture of other specialist immunoglobulin products which are obtained from an overseas sources. Some of these commercial products may be derived from remunerated, voluntary donors. A6.2 Preparations available in New Zealand Immunoglobulin products available in New Zealand include human normal immunoglobulin for intramuscular (IM) use, specific immunoglobulins for intramuscular use, human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous use (IVIG) and human normal immunoglobulin for subcutaneous use (SCIG). All these products have an excellent safety record in both Australia and New Zealand. A6.2.1 Human normal immunoglobulin for intramuscular use Human normal immunoglobulin for intramuscular use (available as Normal Immunoglobulin -VF) is a sterile, preservative -free, pasteurised solution containing 160 mg/mL human plasma proteins and 22.5 mg/mL glycine. The solution has a pH of 6.6. At least 98 percent of the protein comprises immunoglobulins, mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG). Normal Immunoglobulin -VF is intended for IM injection and is available in 5 mL preservative -free vials. It is prepared by Cohn cold ethanol fractionation of human plasma. The man ufacturing process involves specic viral removal steps to reduce the possibility of virus transmission, and includes pasteurisation for viral inactivation and nanofiltration for virus removal. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 563 A6.2.2 Specific immunoglobulin for intramuscular use Specic human i mmunoglobulin preparations for IM use are available, including those for tetanus, hepatitis B, varicella zoster and anti -D. These are manufactured from plasma pools containing donations from individuals known to have high levels of the appropriate antibody . These preparations are available in single vials containing the specific antibody. The volume of the product will be determined by the potency for the appropriate antibody. In unusual circumstances, when supplies of specic immunoglobulin products manufa ctured from New Zealand plasma are not available, commercial products from alternative donor sources may be supplied by NZBS. RIG is imported from a commercial source and is held at NZBS sites in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. The product is not registered as a medicine in New Zealand. It may be accessed and supplied under section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981 after discussion with an NZBS medical officer. A6.2.3 Human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous use The current human normal immunoglobulins for intravenous use in New Zealand are Intragam P and Privigen. Intragam P is produced by CSL Behring Australia and Privigen is produced by CSL Behring in the US. The latter commercial product has been introduced as stocks of IVIG from New Zealand plasma have not been sufficient to meet overall clinical requests for IVIG. Intragam P is a sterile, preservative -free solution containing 6 g of human protein and 10 g of maltose in each 100 mL. The solution has a pH of 4.25. Isotonicity is achieved by the addi tion of maltose. At least 98 percent of the protein has the electrophoretic mobility of IgG. At least 90 percent of the protein is IgG monomer and dimer. Intragam P contains only trace amounts of immunoglobulin A (IgA) (nominally <0.025 mg/mL). Intragam P is available in 50 mL and 200 mL vials. Intragam P and Privigen are produced by chromatographic fractionation of large pools of human plasma obtained from voluntary blood donors. The protein has not been chemically or enzymatically modied. The manufactur ing process contains special steps to reduce the possibility of virus transmission, including pasteurisation (heating at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours) and incubation at low pH. Note: In New Zealand, Intragam P is used to provide intravenous (high -dose) tetanus immun oglobulin. Because the level of immunoglobulin in each batch varies and this indication is not included in the product registration, consultation with an NZBS medical officer is required prior to issuing a prescription.1 Privigen is a sterile, preservative -free 10 percent solution containing 10 g/100 mL of normal immunoglobulin; it is available in 50 mL, 100 mL and 200 mL vials. The solution has a pH of approximately 4.8, has a low sodium content, contains 250 mmol/L of proline, a non -essential amino acid, as a stabiliser and is approximately isotonic. It contains no carbohydrate stabiliser. 564 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 is octanoic acid fractionation and anion exchange chromatography of large pools of human plasma obtained from blood donors in Europe and the US. The distribution of IgG subclasses in Privigen is similar to that in plasma; only trace amount of IgA are present, typically <0.025 mg/mL. The protein has not been enzymatically modified. The ma nufacturing process involves special steps to reduce the possibility of virus transmission including pasteurisation (heating to 60 \u00b0C for 10 hours) and nanofiltration. A6.2.4 Human normal immunoglobulin for subcutaneous use Human normal subcuta neous (Evogam) is produced by CSL Behring, Australia, from NZBS New Zealand -sourced plasma. It is a sterile solution containing 16 g per 100 mL of human immunoglobulin with a purity of at least 98 percent immunoglobulin G (IgG). At least 85 percent consists of monomers and dimers (typically >90 percent ), and less than 10 percent of the IgG is aggregates. The distribution of the IgG subclasses closely resembles that found in normal human plasma. The pH val ue of the solution is 6.6. It contains 2.25 g/100 mL of glycine as a stabiliser. It does not contain a carbohydrate stabiliser (eg, sucrose, maltose) and contains no preservative. Evogam trace amounts of IgA, typically <0.025 mg/mL. Evogam i s produced by chromatographic fractionation of large pools of human plasma obtained from New Zealand 's voluntary blood donors. The manufacturing process involves special steps to reduce the possibility of virus transmission, including pasteurisation (heati ng at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours) and Accessing immunoglobulin or contacting NZBS for advice NZBS operates a 24 -hour on -call service for medical advice and access to these products. Details of the medical officer on call can be obtained from any DHB hospital blood bank in New Zealand. Product can be requested using the NZBS request form. This can be accessed online (www.nzblood.co.nz/Clinical -information/Transfusion -medicine/Information -for- Health -Professionals/Request -forms ), by contacting your local blood bank or writing to: New Zealand Blood Service Private Bag 92071 Victoria Street West Auckland 1142 email: info@nzblood.co.nz telephone (during 2020 565 A6.3 Indications for use A6.3.1 Passive immunisation For advice on the use of immunoglobulin products and specic dosages of these products, please contact a medical officer at NZBS. Copies of the product data sheet are available on NZBS available for passive immunisation (pre - or post - exposure prophylaxis) against measles (see section 12.8.2 ) and hepatitis A (see section 8.8) where active vaccination is not appropriate or is contraindicated. It is not recommended for the prevention of rubella or mumps. Guidance on the use of specic preparations is provided in oth er sections of this Handbook : for pre - or post -exposure prophylaxis against hepatitis B (section 9.5.2 and of primary and acquired immune deciency Recurrent infections can occur in individuals who have low or absent levels of circulating immunoglobulins - so-called humoral immune deciency. This can arise a s a congenital disorder, or it can be acquired as a consequence of a number of diseases. Humoral immune deciency can exist alone or as part of a wider immune deciency syndrome. Immunoglobulin products can be used to prevent recurrent infections in these patients. Until recently, IVIG was the product of choice for managing these patients. A subcutaneous IgG product ( Evogam ) is also now available, which can be infused by patients at home. This avoids the need for outpatient or day -case admission for infusi on of IVIG and is preferred by some patients. The subcutaneous preparation is not suitable for use in prophylaxis against hepatitis A or measles infection. For replacement therapy in antibody deciency disorders, monthly administration of IVIG is given, u sually at a dosage of 0.2 to 0.6 g/kg of body weight.2 Subcutaneous product is administered one to two times per week, with the overall monthly dosage similar to that of IVIG. For both types of product, the dosage and frequency of infusion should be based on the effectiveness in the individual patient. In gen eral, however, the aim of treatment should be to maintain the serum IgG at or above a level of 5 g/L. 566 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 A6.4 Storage and administration Immunoglobulin products must be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C and must not be frozen. They should also be protected from light. If the product appears turbid or contains sediment, it must not be used. Always check and observe the manufacturer 's expiry date before injecting the product. The product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative and must be used immediately after openin g the vial; any unused portions should be discarded. Information on the batch number and dose injected must be kept in the recipient 's records. The intramuscular and subcutaneous forms of normal immunoglobulin should be brought to room temperature before use. They must not be given intravenously because of the possible reactions discussed in section A6.7.2 The intramuscular product, Normal Immunoglobulin -VF, should be given slowly by deep IM injection, using a needle of appropriate gauge and length. If a large volume (more than 5 mL) is required, administration in divided doses at different sites is recommended. The subcutaneous product, Evogam, is normally given using an infusion pump. Information on infusion rates is provided in the medicine 's data sheet. A6.4.1 Interactions with othe r drugs Immunoglobulin should not be mixed with other pharmaceutical products, except as indicated by the manufacturer. Passively acquired antibody can interfere with the response to live attenuated virus vaccines. Live virus vaccines should be given at least three weeks before, or deferred for up to 11 months after, doses of human normal immunoglobulin or other blood products. The interval will be determined by the blood product and dose received (see Table A6.1 ).

Unvaccinated persons might not be protected fully against measles during the entire recommended interval, and additional doses of immunog lobulin or measles vaccine might be indicated after measles exposure. b. Immunoglobulin is not normally available or recommended in New Zealand for pre -travel use. c. Cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin is not available in New Zealand. Contact NZBS MO to discus s access to an alternative product. d. Palivizumab contains antibody only to respiratory syncytial virus and does not interfere with the immune response to live or inactivated vaccines. e. Other fractionated blood products may contain traces of immunoglobu lin. Contact a transfusion medicine specialist to discuss potential impact on vaccination.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 60(RR2): 1 -61. Table 5. Deferral interval for vaccination after blood components and products calculated from NZBS data. Note: These intervals do not apply to BCG vaccines and rotavirus vaccines in inf ants, nor to zoster vaccine for individuals 50 years of age, the efficacy of which is unaffected by the presence of passive immunoglobulin. Inactivated vaccines may be administered concurrently with passive antibody (although in separate syringes) to induce active immunity, as is done for some tetanus -prone wounds and for babies born to HBsAg -positive mothers. A6.4.2 Passive transfer of antibodies and interference with serological testing Serological testing after the administration of immunoglo bulin may detect transfused antibodies for several months after administration. Serological testing for any infection after immunoglobulin should therefore be discussed with an expert. A6.5 Duration of effect The estimated half -life of intramuscular human norm al immunoglobulin is 27 \u00b1 7 days (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]).2 The duration of effect is linked to the initial dosage. The estimated half -life of intravenous human normal immunoglobulin is 40 \u00b1 8 days (mean \u00b1 SD).2 The estimated ha lf-life of subcutaneous human normal is 55 days -165 days).2 IMMUNISATION Immunoglobulin products intended for subcutaneous and intramuscular injection must not be administered intravenously because of the potential for anaphylactic reactions. Health professionals should check the package insert for the immunoglobulin product to be administered. Skin tests should not be conducted with immunoglobulin preparations. Intradermal injection of any concentrated immunoglobulin product may cause a local inflammatory reaction, which can be misinterpreted as a posit ive allergic reaction. Allergic responses to normal immunoglobulin given in the prescribed IM route are extremely rare, but may occur in those with complete immunoglobulin A (IgA) deciency in whom anti -IgA is present. Intramuscular injection of immunoglobulin products should be avoided in patients with a low platelet count or with any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate IM injections. In these circumstances, the injection may be given subcutaneously, with a lightly applied pressure pad if prone to bruising; for example, if thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand disease is present.1 A6.6.2 Precautions Injections of Normal Immunoglobulin -VF must be IM, and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of th e syringe before injection to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel (see section 2.2.3). As with any injection, there is a risk of anaphylaxis. Adrena line and other means of treating acute reactions should therefore be immediately available (see section 2.3.3). A6.7 Potential responses and adverse events following pa ssive immunisation Clinicians in New Zealand are requested to notify all adverse reactions arising from, or in association with, the use of blood products. Reactions to any immunoglobulin product should be reported on a form obtainable from NZBS or any loc al DHB hospital blood bank. 570 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Local tenderness, erythema and muscle stiffness occasionally occur at the site of injection and may persist for several hours after intramuscular injection. An occasional recipient may react more strongly, with a low -grade feve r. Systemic reactions, including nausea, urticaria and generalised hypersensitivity reactions, may occur.1, 2 Reactions to IVIG tend to be related to the infusion rate and are most likely to occur during the rst hour of the infusion. However, delayed reactions can occur, and include nausea, vomiting, chest pains, rigors, dizziness and aching legs. Systemic and local reactions are more common in those being treated for hypog ammaglobulinaemia than in those with normal gammaglobulin levels who are being treated with immunoglobulin preparations for autoimmune conditions. Occasional reports exist of renal failure following infusion of IVIG. These largely relate to sucrose -contai ning products. Intragam P and Privigen, the IVIG products available in New Zealand, do not contain sucrose, but patients should be adequately hydrated prior to their administration. Renal function should be monitored in patients considered to be at increas ed risk. Aseptic meningitis has been reported following treatment with IVIG. This may present up to two days following treatment. Anaphylactic reactions, although rare, have been reported following injection of immunoglobulin products, although anaphylaxi s is more likely to occur following intravenous infusion. Other significant adverse events that have been observed in New Zealand and are mostly associated with large or ongoing treatment with high -dose IVIG or hypotension. Immunoglobulin products may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines. In general, live vaccines should be given at least three weeks before or up to 11 months after the immunoglobulin preparation (see Table A6.1 ). This does not apply to the yellow fever vaccine, because New Zealand blood donors are very unlikely to have antibodies to this virus. For travellers abroad, the n ecessary interval may not be possible. No evidence of adverse interaction with rotavirus vaccine has been reported. See section 1.6.3 for further information about adverse events and reporting. References 1. NZ Blood. 2016.

URL: https://www.nzblood.co.nz/ assets/Transfusion - 2017 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 571 Appendix 7 : Vaccine presentation, preparation, disposal, and needle -stick recommendations A7.1 Presentation of vaccines Most of the vaccines in current use are supplied in prelled syringes or vials. The exceptions to this are the rotavirus vaccine, which is supplied as a syringe -style oral applicator, and the BCG vaccine, which is supplied as a multi -dose vial. A vial is a glass container with a rubber seal on the top, protected by a metal or plastic cap until it is ready for use. Assume the rubber seal is latex unless stated 'latex-free'. Vials contain either liquid or powder (freeze -dried or pellet /cake) preparations. Vaccines should not be mixed in the same syringe, unless the manufacturer 's data sheet specically states it is permitted (eg, the DTaP -IPV-HepB vaccine is mixed with the Hib -PRP pellet for the Infanrix -hexa vaccine). A7.2 Preparation and administration of vaccines To minimise the risk of spread of infection and needle -stick injury, vaccinators should observe standard occupational health and safety guidelines. Ensure proper hygiene is maintained (ie, regularly wash hands for at least 20 seconds and dry them for 20 seconds, or regularly use an alcohol -based hand rub if hands are not visibly soiled). Prepare the appropriate injection equipment for the vaccines to be administered (see section 2.2). Ensure the refrigerator temperature is within the required range of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C before removing the vaccines (refer to the National Standards for Vaccine Storage and Transportation for Immunisation Providers 2 017 (2nd edition) the correct vaccine is taken from the refrigerator and that it is within the expiry date. 572 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Vaccines should only be drawn up after infor med consent has been obtained and the vaccine requirements determined. This should include an NIR status query (if applicable) if there is uncertainty about previous doses. Any vaccines drawn up and not used should be discarded unless otherwise stated. Vaccines in vials require one needle to draw the vaccine into the syringe, and then a new needle to administer the vaccine. The passage of needles through rubber seals causes blunting, resulting in increased tissue trauma if that needle is used to administ er the injection. Also, a new needle prevents tracking the vaccine through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, thereby reducing the risk of local reactions. Do not expel the air contained in the new needle - it is sterile and minute in quantity (see chapter 2, Table 2.7). A7.2.1 Preparing vaccines supplied as a liquid preparation Where applicable, remove the detachable portion of the label from the vial or syringe and place it on (or with) the appropriate documentation. If there is no detachable label, note the batch number and expiry date. Inspect the vacc ine for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. Shake the vial: Most inactivated vaccines contain an adjuvant, and to obtain a uniform suspension they mus t be shaken vigorously prior to being drawn up. Flip the plastic cap off the vial, taking care not to touch the rubber seal. With the vial upright, insert the tip of the needle through the centre of the rubber seal, where it is thinner and easier to penetr ate. Invert the vial and draw up the entire volume into the syringe. Withdraw the needle from the vial. Change the needle, choosing the appropriate gauge and length for administration. Administer the vaccine. Dispose of the empty vials, used syringes and n eedles into the sharps container. Complete the required documentation (eg, in the PMS). A7.2.2 Preparing vaccines supplied as powder/pellet vaccines Some vaccines are presented as a prefilled syringe and freeze -dried (lyophilised) combination vaccines where: the pellet or powder preparation is reconstituted with the diluent (vial or prefilled syringe) supplied by the manufacturer (eg, MMR or Hib -PRP-T), or the pellet or powder preparation is reconstituted with a prefilled syringe containing vaccine (eg, DTaP -IPV-HepB/Hib). The method for reconstituting the vaccine varies depending upon whether vials or prefilled syringes are used, as follows. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 573 Reconstituting vaccines where the diluent is in a vial Where applicable, remove the detachable portion of the label from the diluent and/or vaccine (powder/pellet) vials and place these on (or with) the appropriate documentation. If there are no detachable labels, note the batch number and expiry date for both vaccine and diluent. Inspect the vaccine (powder/pellet) and diluent vials for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. Flip the plastic cap off the diluent vial, taking care not to touch the rubber seal. With the d iluent vial upright, insert the needle tip through the centre of the rubber seal, where it is thinner and easier to penetrate. Invert the vial and draw up the entire volume of diluent into the syringe. Flip the plastic cap off the powder/pellet vial, and slowly, to avoid frothing, empty the contents of the syringe (diluent) into the powder/pellet vial, using the vial entry technique mentioned above. Swirl the vial gently to dissolve the powder/pellet. The needle and syringe may be removed or left in place. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be checked to see that the colour compares with the information supplied by the manufacturer on the data sheet and that there is no particulate matter present. If the colour does not match t he manufacturer 's information, do not use. Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine into the syringe. Withdraw the needle from the vial. Change the needle, choosing the appropriate gauge and length for administration. Once reconstituted, the vaccine must be used within the manufacturer 's recommended period. See the respective vaccine data sheets for more information. Administer the vaccine. Dispose of the empty vials, used syringes and needles into the sharps container. Complete the required documentation (eg, in the PMS). Reconstituting vaccines where the vaccine or diluent is in a prefilled syringe Where applicable, remove the detachable portion of the label from the prefilled syringe and/or vaccine (powder/pellet) vial and place these on ( or with) the appropriate documentation. If there are no detachable labels, note the batch number and expiry date for both the prefilled syringe and the vaccine (powder/pellet) vial. Inspect the prefilled syringe and vaccine (powder/pellet) vial for any for eign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. Flip the plastic cap off the powder/pellet vial, and with the vial upright, insert the prefilled syringe needle tip throu gh the centre of the rubber seal, where it is thinner and easier to penetrate. 574 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Slowly, to avoid frothing, empty the contents of the prefilled syringe into the vial. Swirl the vial gently to dissolve the powder/pellet. The needle and syringe may be removed or left in place. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be checked to see that the colour compares with the information supplied by the manufacturer on the data sheet and that there is no particulate matter present. If the colour or presentation does no t match the manufacturer 's information, do not use. Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine into the syringe. Withdraw the needle from the vial. Change the needle, choosing the appropriate gauge and length for administration. Once reconstit uted, the vaccine must be used within the manufacturer 's recommended period. See the respective vaccine data sheets for more information. Administer the vaccine. Dispose of the empty vials, used syringes and needles into the sharps container. Complete the required documentation (eg, in the PMS). A7.2.3 Preparing vaccines supplied as prefilled syringes Where applicable, remove the detachable portion of the label from the prefilled syringe and place it on (or with) the appropriate documentation. If there is no detachable label, note the batch number and expiry date. Inspect the vaccine for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. Shake the syringe: Most inactivat ed vaccines contain an adjuvant, and to obtain a uniform suspension they must be shaken vigorously prior to being administered. Do not expel air if the needle is fixed (eg, with an influenza vaccine). This prevents tracking the vaccine through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, thereby reducing the risk of local reactions. When the needle is not fixed, attach an appropriate administration needle. Do not expel the air. Administer the vaccine. Dispose of the used syringe and needle into the sharps container. Complete the required documentation (eg, in the PMS). IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 575 A7.2.4 Preparing the rotavirus vaccine The rotavirus vaccine is administered orally. It is available as a syringe -type applicator with a plunger stopper. Remove the detachable portion of the label (which inclu des the batch number but not the expiry date) and place it on (or with) the appropriate documentation. Note the expiry date. Inspect the vaccine for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. Remove the protective tip cap from the oral applicator. Administer the entire contents of the oral applicator into the infant 's mouth, towards the inner cheek. Discard the empty applicator and cap into the sharps containe r. For more information, refer to the manufacturer 's data sheet (available on the Medsafe website, www.medsafe.govt.nz ). A7.2.5 Preparing vaccines supplied as multi -dose vials1 The vial should be marked with the date and time of opening and the vaccinator 's initials. Shake the vial before use and before drawing up subsequent vaccine doses. Inspect the vaccine for any foreign particulate matter and/or variation in the physical appearance described by the manufacturer - if either is observed, do not use. To ensure optimal vial dosage and minimal vaccine wastage, use a 1 mL syringe. Flip the plastic cap off the vial, taking care not to touch the rubber seal. Inspect the rubber seal. If there is any doubt about the integrity of the seal (eg, the vial leaks when turned upside down), do not use. Ideally, draw up all doses of the vaccine at the same time; this allows the drawing - up needle to remain in the vial and avoids the need for alcohol swabbing (of the rubber seal ). Alcohol swabs should be used with caution. There is an increased risk of alcohol contamination when the swabbed rubber seal is repeatedly pierced. If an alcohol swab is used, allow 30 seconds for the alcohol to completely dry before inserting the needle into the rubber seal. Use each vial in one session of vaccinating and discard the vial four hours after first opening (or follow the manufacturer 's instructions), even if the vaccine has not been used. 1 Sources : WHO . 2014.

All needles plus empty or partly used vials, syringes, dosing tubes and caps should be discarded into the sharps container for crush incineration. A7.3.1 Sharps containers Sharps containers should be made of rigid, leak - and puncture -proof material. They must be tted with a carrying handle and have an opening that is wide enough to allow disposable materials to be dropped into the container with one hand while still preventing re moval of the contents. Sharps containers should be situated out of children 's reach and available in every area where vaccinations take place. Sharps containers should be lled only to the indicated line, then sealed and given to an approved hazardous wast e disposal person for incineration (as per the Resource Management Act 1991). A7.3.2 Spillages In the event of blood or vaccine splashes on the skin, thoroughly wash the area under cold running water, then wash with soap and water or the hand wash that vaccinato rs have available. In the event of spills on work surfaces, put on gloves and treat the spill by wiping the area with a disposable pad soaked in 0.5 percent hypochlorite (household bleach diluted 1 to 9 parts water). Repeat with the hypochlorite solution a nd a fresh pad, then clean up with water or a commercial detergent. Alternatively, granular hypochlorite can be used for liquid spills, by applying sufcient granules to absorb the spilt fluid and then cleaning up after 10 minutes ' contact time. Carefully s eal all contaminated material in an approved biohazard bag for incineration by an approved hazardous waste disposal person. Contaminated linen is adequately treated by a routine hot wash cycle (60 -70\u00b0C) using an ordinary bleach concentration. IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 577 A7.3.3 Recommendati ons following a needle -stick injury In the event of a needle -stick injury, follow the guidelines below. The vaccinator should stop what they are doing and attend to the injury. Wounds and skin sites should be washed with soap and water. There is no evidenc e that encouraging bleeding or applying antiseptic reduces the risk of infection, but these actions are not contraindicated. The injury should be immediately reported to the medical advisor or employer, who should consider what immediate action is advisabl e. When the needle -stick injury involves exposure to an individual 's blood, serological testing of that source individual should be sought and undertaken as soon as possible. Blood should be withdrawn from the affected vaccinator within a few days after the injury and counselling arranged. Testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV serology should be undertaken. Depending on the infection status of the individual and the immune status of the injured vaccinator, it may be appropriate to start anti -HIV medications within the next few hours or to administer HBIG within the next few days. The blood -borne viruses of main concern in needle -stick injuries are hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. All vaccinators should be immunised against hepatitis B and their antibody status known. Currently in New Zealand most HIV -infected individuals (or their parents/guardians) are likely to know their status at the time of immunisation, so HIV testing in case of needle -stick injuries is not routinely advocated. If there is a possibility that the individual could be HIV infected, the informed co nsent of the individual/parent/ guardian is required before blood is drawn for testing. Blood -borne virus exposures after vaccination are rarely of high risk: because of the small ne edle size there is seldom visible blood, and there is a low risk of blood - borne viruses in the community. For more information, see also section 9.5.7 for serologi cal testing guidelines for hepatitis B, the Starship Clinical Guidelines for Community Needle -stick Injuries (available at https://www.starship.org.nz/guidelines/communi ty-needlestick - injuries/ ) (for needle -stick injuries from needles discarded in the community) or your local DHB guidelines (if available). 578 IMMUNISATION HANDBOOK 2020 Appendix 8 : High -incidence TB countries Neonatal BCG is recommended and funded for infants at inc reased risk of TB, dened as those who: will be living in a house or family/whnau with a person with either current TB or a history of TB have one or both parents or household members or carers who within the last five years lived for a period of six mont hs or longer in countries with a TB rate 40 per 100,000 during their rst ve years will be living for three months or longer in a country with a TB rate 40 per 100,000.
