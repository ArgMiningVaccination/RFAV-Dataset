More than half of Minnesota's citizens are women. Their particular history illustrates how this state responds to individual needs through a framework of basic freedoms and responsibilities. 2 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE WOMEN IN MINNESOTA'S HISTORY by Gretchen Kreuter President, Women Historians of the Midwest and Rhoda R. Gilman Research Associate, Minnesota Historical Society Minnesota Women ... in Agriculture and Industry The official Bicentennial Medal of the State of Minnesota shows on its obverse side the figure of an Indian man paddling a canoe. Above him is a peace pipe, and he is surrounded by the various state symbols. The reverse side is dominated in.the center by the bold figure of a pioneer farmer with his hand on a plow. On his left is a fur trader with gun in hand, while on his right and a little behind him stands the pioneer or immigrant woman with a shawl around her head and an infant in her arms. From this composite view of how the state sees its past, the most conspicuously missing figure is an Indian woman. The role of the Indian woman has been obscured by generations of prejudice, misunder\u00ad standing, and false stereotypes. The economies of both Chippewa (Ojibway) and Sioux (Dakota). who were Minnesota's main Native American peoples, were based upon hunting, food gathering, and a limited amount of agriculture. The natural division of labor in such societies leaves agriculture largely in the hands of women. But to European settlers agriculture seemed the only legitimate form of labor. They tended to define as sport the grueling and dangerous work done by Indian men in feeding and clothing their families and to see Indian women universally as slaves and drudges. The distorted picture resulting from the difference in cultures has hidden the status and dignity to which women's productivity usually entitled them in traditional Sioux and Chippewa communities. It was the skilled labor of women that processed the vast number of skins and hides required for shelter, clothing, and later for the all-important fur trade. The extent of this processing helped to determine the value of many pelts in trade and gave the women of the band an important voice in the business of exchange. Women also fashioned pottery, wove baskets and mats, gathered fuel, made maple sugar, collected and preserved other wild foods, and planted gardens where the soil and climate made this possible. Men and women cooperated on the heavier tasks of fishing, harvesting wild rice, and building canoes and houses. When hunting, trade, or warfare called men away for long periods, all of the necessary tasks were left to women. Because life was communal, much of this labor was performed in groups made up of women from several families or even whole villages. In this the Indian woman had an advantage over her European sister, who was isolated on a pioneer farm. As the literature of early settlement has made starkly clear, isolation was one of the hardest conditions of labor for the farm wife of the middle border. Alone with her husband and children, sometimes miles from the nearest neighbors, she performed her full share in the backbreaking task of transforming the land from forests and prairies to fields and farms. Even though her husband spared her the heaviest jobs, her hours of labor were far longer than his, and to her work was added the physical strain of bearing a large family to provide an expanded labor force for the next generation. Native American terminology in this manual: Dakota is the language spoken by the Sioux. Ojibway is the language spoken by the Chippewa. One of the first essentials for opening a prosperous farm was a healthy woman who was willing to share the work of garden and barnyard-or field when necessary. And if the farm did not prosper, she carried her share of the resulting misery, whether'it was caused by natural disasters like drought and grasshoppers or by the seemingly endless years of falling prices and agricultural depression that dogged Minnesota farmers after the Civil War. As one of her spokeswomen observed: \"If the average farmer is a slave then his wife is the slave of a slave. Her position is fixed by his and is always a little the worse of the two.\" When Oliver H. Kelley of Elk River, Minnesota, was spinning dreams for a nationwide brotherhood of farmers, he found a sympathetic listener in his wife's niece, Caroline Hall. She suggested that such an organization should be open to farmers' wives, and Kelley adopted the idea when he founded the Patrons of Husbandry, better known as the Grange, in 1867. For this first great farm organization, the inclusion of women proved to be a crucial source of strength. Instead of being just another lodge group attended by men, the Grange became a focus of family activity. Women attending the meetings with their husbands were released from isolation and found a sense of comradesh ip and shared problems and opportunities. They made enormous contributions to the educational and social functions of the organization, and in many areas the annual Grange picnic became the great community gathering of the season. More frankly political in nature and objectives, the Farmers Alliance of the 1880s denied membership to women, but farm wives, awakened by their experience with the Grange, refused to be excluded, and many attended meetings, questioned speakers, and voiced their own opinions both from the platform and in print. Meanwhile the daughters of these women were turning to Minnesota's growing cities in search of employment. In 1870 only 16 per cent of the state's population was urban, but by 1890 nearly 34 per cent of Minnesotans lived in cities, and job opportunities for young women were beginning to appear in mills, factories, offices, and stores. Until that time the possibilities had been mainly limited to domestic service and teaching, but in 1900 more than 12 per cent of Minnesota's working women were employed as garment makers or seamstresses, and during the same period the Twin Cities had a larger proportion of women workers who paid for board and lodging away from home than did any other place except Lowell, Massachusetts. This led to much uneasiness about the moral fiber of Minnesota's venturesome young females, but the concern was not deep enough to induce all employers to pay a living wage. In 1888, 250 women who made overalls and work clothes for the Minneapolis firm of Shotwell, Clerihew, and Lothman struck for better pay. Their piece work rates of 3112 cents for a shirt and 7 cents for a pair of overalls enabled most of them to make no more than 3 dollars a week, while decent room and board alone cost nearly that much. As Minnesota moved into the twentieth century there were repeated attempts to correct the worst of such conditions through minimum wage laws and regulation of working hours for women and children-always on the assumption that woman's very nature put her at a disadvantage in the job market and subjected her to exploitation. A more effective instrument of protection might have been collective bargaining, but organizing unions was slow work in the occupations where most women were employed, for these were always marginal areas and there were more women seeking employment than jobs available. Not until the late 1930s, when many women workers were included within the net of the great industrial unions, did organized labor begin to affect any important part of the female working force. There were exceptions, of course. In the mid 1930s a Minneapolis elevator operator named Nellie Stone Johnson organized an effective local of the hotel and restaurant employees union among her largely female and minority co-workers. Twin Cities laundry workers were organized in 1934, and St. Paul schoolteachers, led by women like Mabel Colter, Florence Rood, and Mary McGough formed one of the nation's earliest and strongest locals of the American Federation of Teachers. 3 Main workroom at Brown and Bigelow, 1917 -Minnesota Hi<'!orical Society photo Main office at Twin City Milk Producers Assn. -Minnesota. Historical Society photo Perhaps the real history of working women during the twentieth century is the story of the paper work explosion. In 1900 only about seven per cent of Minnesota's working women were employed in sales and clerical jobs; in 1970 th is had risen to more than 23 per cent. Other major occupations were service oriented: teaching, nursing, and the. restaurant trades. In the same period the number of women working outside the home had risen from less than 16 per cent of the potential female labor force to nearly 42 per cent. This enormous increase did not represent a mass invasion by women of fields already occupied by men; instead it reflected the expanding need for record-keepers and communicators in an ever more complex and interdependent society. It also represented a shift to institufions of human services lik~ nursing and early childhood education, which 'had traditionally been performed by women in the home. Minnesota Women ... In Edue.ation In the summer of 1847, Harriet Bishop arrived in Minnesota territory and opened the first permanent day school for the children of SI. Paul. Education in the area, of course, did not begin with Harriet Bishop. Among Native American tribes it had gone on for centuries, as parents and grandparents transmitted their practical skills and spiritual knowledge to succeeding generations. Within the families of early Minnesota settlers the same kind of education had been carried on: in their homes, mothers were both the nurturers and teachers of their children. From the seventeenth century on, missionaries had tried shaping lives by religious teaching. As the population of Minnesota grew, however, education became linked to the kind of society settlers were trying to create. Permanent schools and trained teachers were supposed to be the instruments of civilization, and women were specifically sought for the civilizing task. Harriet Bishop and the many young women teachers who followed her into the state were supposed to encompass all the roles of all the educators who had gone before. They were expected to be mothers and nurturers, transmitters of white culture, and religious missionaries-and all on very little money. Harriet Bishop received $100 a year. These early teachers had more pressing hardships than low pay. For example, Bishop's first schoolhouse at SI. Paul was a mud-walled log hovel that had been a blacksmith's shop. It was covered with bark and chinked with mud. Each day a hen laid an egg in one corner, cackled, and departed. Snakes slithered along the crude floor boards, and large rats frequently observed the lessons. Living conditions were spartan. Teachers were obliged to board around at the homes of their pupils' parents, sometimes sleeping on straw pallets in the tiniest coldest room in primitive cabins. Teaching, nevertheless, was one of the few respectable ways in which a young woman could respond to the call of the West, satisfy her sense of adventure, and live a somewhat more independent life than she would have been permitted at home. She could also believe, most devoutly, that her work was necessary and important. As Harriet Bishop observed, \"To woman is entrusted the future destiny of Minnesota.\" This belief was not shared by the men. As education began to take on an official structure in 5 the 1850s, women were ignored and excluded. As school lands w\"ere set aside, taxes levied, and a state superintendent of public instruction chosen, women were left out of the decision-making process at all levels-from the state legislature to the local school committees. Although women teachers were at work in tiny tumbledown schools in all 'corners of the state, they were virtually invisible in the manuals of instruction written for teachers: \"The teacher shall be a gentleman,\" one manual advised. Lest anyone be unclear about the intent of the male pronoun, some school districts made the regulation explicit: \"The male teacher in any school shall be the principal.\" When educators turned their attention to the pupils within the schools, the same images recurred. Schoolrooms had far more girls than boys in them, but schoolbooks were populated chiefly by males: \"Reading maketh a full man,\" read one common maxim. \"Teach youth, for men cannot be taught,\" read another. Girls made their appearance chiefly in little stories of fear and incompetence. As high schools and preparatory schools, then normal schools and colleges began\u00b7to be established, women's special \"fitness\" for certain tasks was emphasized. High school, it was said, would prepare men for the university; it would furnish them with training for patriotism and noble manhood. High school would prepare women for the normal schools, where they could learn to teach. If they were the daughters of the rich, they might go on to fashionable boarding schools where \"young ladies may come out thoroughly finished and accomplished.\" None of the discussions of women's fitness for teaching or of their becoming \"finished and accomplished\" reflected connection with intellect or creativity; neither did they concern leadership, for educators assumed that only the \"sterner sex\" had the qualities necessary for command. The emphasis upon fitness grew louder and stronger in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Doctors expressed concern over female health, and warned that women might contract brain fever and go insane if they pursued the same education as men. Minnesota educators took such warnings very seriously. One principal, for. example, wrote of what he called the \"problems\" and \"morbid conditions\" of the high schools: Why, he asked, \"do so many of the high schools have three times as many young ladies as gentlemen? Why do the ladies often capture more than their share of scholastic honors?\" These conditions were puzzling and alamiing, too, if one believed that brain fever was likely to come on the heels of female intellectual exertion. One way of solving such problems was to make sure women received an education appropriate to their sphere, the home and family. Therefore at the end of the nineteenth century, domestic science courses for girls were introduced into the high schools. The women who taught them were paid substantially less than the men who taught manual arts cou rses for boys. One of the reasons educators played so relentlessly on the theme of a \"fit\" education was that more and more women were slipping outside of \"woman's sphere\" and refusing to be silent and invisible. In 1875 women won the right to vote and hold office in school elections in Minnesota, and in the years that followed some were elected and re-elected to county superintendencies and school boards. In early meetings of the Minnesota Education Association women secured passage of an equal pay resolution, and in 1910 Minneapolis women teachers formed their own organization to serve as a lobbying and pressure group. Nevertheless most people still assumed that women educators were not really professionals. They were either mothers-in-training-many were very young-or mother-substitutes\u00ad single ladies who gratified their maternal impulses in the classroom. State Flag State Seal The present state flag was adopted by the 1957 legislature. Pictured in the center of the flag is the state seal. Three dates are woven into a flowered wreath: 1858, the statehood year; 1819, the establishment of Fort Snelling; and 1893, the year the original flag was adopted. The Great Seal of the State of Minnesota is the insignia which the Secretary of State affixes to government papers and documents to make them official. It is, in effect, the signature of the state. Minnesota actually has two seals. One, for the territory of Minnesota, was adopted in 1849 and approved by Governor Alexander Ramsey and the territorial legislature. When Minnesota became a state on May 11,1858, there was no official state seal and according to law no official act could be undertaken without it. The territorial seal was used until a new design was adopted by Governor Sibley. The legislature did not approve this design. Governor Sibley made some changes in the proposed seal including changing the original Latin motto to French: \"L'Etoile du Nord,\" thereby making Minnesota the North Star State. In 1861, after three years of use, the legislature adopted the changed design making it the official state seal. 7 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE This inability to see women as policymakers or professionals was modified a little when normal schools were established in Minnesota for training of teachers. Women did much of the teaching in these schools and occupied many administrative posts, although seldom the highest ones. Among the most distinguished teacher-administrators was Isabel Lawrence of St. Cloud. A leader in the child-study movement of the late nineteenth century, she became superintendent of the model school in 1878 and strongly influenced its development. Young people, she believed, ought not to be sent to teach in public school classrooms until they were well-experienced professionals. Just having the mother-spirit was not enough. When the president of St. Cloud Normal School became ill and died, Isabel lawrence replaced him in office, but only until a permanent president, a man, could be selected. Similar experiences, and women's ways of dealing with them, were evident in higher education in Minnesota. Most private colleges and the state university had been open to women students from the start, and in most of them there were more women than men until well into the twentieth century. Nevertheless, warnings about women's susceptibility to brain fever and mental breakdown continued to be raised. Concern for sexual morality also entered the picture when one talked of higher education. President William W. Folwell of the University of Minnesota believed there ought to be \"separate entrances and corridors for ladies, a separate study room, adjacent to which should be their cloak rooms.\" By the 1890s, women were a familiar sight on most campuses. Some had become faculty members. One of the most colorful was Maria Sanford, a professor of rhetoric whose lectures and magic lantern shows introduced a generation of Minnesotans to the joys of classical art and learning. One of the most distinguished was Ada Comstock, who went from teaching and administrative posts at the University of Minnesota to become dean of Smith College and then president of Radcliffe College. Early in the twentieth century Minnesota's Catholic women acquired four campuses of their own. In St. Paul the College of St. Catherine was founded in 1905 by the Sisters of St. Joseph. Under the leadership of women like Sister Seraphina Ireland and Mother Antonia MCHugh it became the country's first fully accredited Catholic women's college and the first to have a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. It was followed in 1912 by St. Theresa at Winona and St. Scholastica in Duluth, and the next year saw the academy of St. Benedict at St. Joseph 8 expanded into yet another women's college. The outcome of most women's education, however, remained what it had been in Minnesota's early decades. Women's college degrees were not passports into new careers. In higher education as in the high schools before, woman's sphere became part of the curriculum. Home economics departments were introduced in many Minnesota colleges in the first quarter of the twentieth century, and by the end of World War I, cookery and child care had elbowed aside the liberal arts. With the coming of the depression of the 1930s, economic crisis was added as a reason for limiting the progress of women. If they sought professional employment, they were often told they were robbing men of jobs. Many school systems established regulations forbidding married women to teach, and providing for immediate dismissal upon marriage. Yet all the while, all over Minnesota in the one-room schools that still dotted the rural landscape, in the city high schools and the state teachers colleges, women continued to teach as salaries continued to decline. Only minor improvements in their opportunities and status took place in the next three decades. By the late 1960s, however, many people began to take a hard look at the issues that women in education had been raising for a century, and began to devel.op new approaches to deal with them. Women of the 1860s knew that they ought to be paid as much as men for doing the same work; a hundred years later they secured the force of law behind that moral and economic imperative-equal pay for equal work. Public school at Taylors Falls, 7899 -,\\linrw,otJ HI~toricdl Socipty photo Women like Isabel Lawrence and Ada Comstock knew that women could organize and lead, and that only discriminatory practices prevented them from doing so. In 1972, after pressure from a variety of women's groups, the Minnesota State Department of Education agreed in principle, and issued some new guidelines: \"Discrimination in hiring and promoting on the basis of sex and marital status,\" the department declared, \"has been a damaging and long-standing practice in Minnesota's educational system. The State Board requests the State Department to eliminate all sex-based requirements for employment or promotion.\" Many girls and their teachers always knew that the schoolbook world of adventurous boys and stalwart fathers was only half a world. The work of groups like the Emma Willard Task Force of Minneapolis helped bring about an order by the State Department of Education requesting local school boards to select books and teaching material which promote elimination of sex bias. Many women in Minnesota's earliest colleges and universities knew that they were unlikely to get brain fever, but very likely to be discriminated against as educated women. By the early 1970s, such groups as the women's caucuses of the teachers' unions and Minnesota Women in Higher Education had organized to enhance their sense of identity and purpose, and to fight discrimination.

State The Lake Superior Agate, a quartz mineral which is'basically red with white Gemstone bands, was named official gemstone in 1969. It is found primarily in the red glacial drift areas of central and northeastern Mi nnesota. Minnesota Women ... in Arts For the Sioux and Chippewa who inhabited Minnesota for centuries before the coming of white women and men, the arts were an essential part of their material world and their spiritual beliefs and rituals. Tribally or group-oriented, the arts were used to reinforce group solidarity and social values. For this reason, one rarely finds the names of individual artists who contributed to Native American arts, although women as a group were, through the arts, integral to the expression of Indian life and culture. Most of the activities in Indian societies were differentiated by sex, and the arts were no exception. Certain forms of artistic expression-what the white culture came to call \"crafts\"-were considered appropriate to women: quill work, beadwork, and basketry for example. Women were also limited in the designs they used: if an Indian woman wished to decorate her husband's weapons or clothing, she was allowed to use only deSigns that signified ownership, strength, courage, and similar attributes. Music and dance were also differentiated by sex. Frances Densmore, an early ethnomusi\u00ad cologist of the Chippewa, observed that music was essentially a man's occupation. Allhough women participated in some dances, they used a shuffling \"woman's step,\" according to Densmore, and the most active dances were limited to the men. Although women were sometimes admitted to the Ojibway Grand Medicine Society and allowed to sing its ritual songs and draw the ritual pictographs, they did not often progress beyond the lowest ranks of the society. According to one observer, women were barred from the active roles of singing and telling traditional tales. 11 Although women were restricted in their roles in art and music, these roles were a source of prestige and pride for them. The crafts they produced were an essential element of the barter economy in traditional Indian cultures and an economic staple in the cash economy that developed after the coming of the white man. Women who were especially skilled were celebrated by their own tribes,.and their reputation became known in neighboring tribes and among whites. When Nathan Sturgis sent moccasins\u00b7to his daughters back.east, in 1834, he declared, \"There is but one woman in the country who can make or garnish them equally neat.\" Gift-giving played an important role in Indian culture. Therefore objects that could be used as gifts were an essential part of the Ojibway woman's productions. Women also achieved recognition for the dance costumes they embroidered and wove in quills or beads for their husbands and themselves. Contact with European culture, which began in the era of the fur trade, enhanced rather than diminished many of the native arts, especially those created by women. Materials such as glass beads, ribbon, and woven goods, became available, and a new demand for trading goods developed. As Indian artist Carl Gawboy recently pointed out, \"While the tribes suffered economically under the influence of the fur trade, the arts underwent a kind of renaissance.\" The introduction of white culture into Minnesota in the early nineteenth century brought a new conception of the nature and purpose of art. This conception, essentially European in CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE origin, emphasized aesthetic enjoyment-not art as an organic part of all life or as inseparable from spiritual and material purposes. The old conception flourished alongside the new, even among white settlers in Minnesota. Pioneer women, like Indian women, engaged in a variety of arts. Some were linked with utility: quilting, for example, was both an art and a craft, practiced in part to please the artist and her audience, and in part to provide protection from Minnesota winter nights. Some of the arts pioneer women practiced were linked with the expression of spiritual beliefs and needs. Church music and choir singing were supposed to be \"beautiful,\" but they were also intended to heighten the spiritual awareness of performers and listeners. The new definition of art, however, was connected with a totally different kind of society-the society to which early settlers aspired. Art meant civilization, refinement, and leisure, and, for middle-class Minnesotans especially, the state of the arts provided an index to the degree of civilization a state, a community, or a family had attained. The arts became a measure of progress, and women became their special custodians-the carriers of culture. One of the first symbols of artistic culture and refinement in early Minnesota was the piano. Pianos were brotrght overland to Minnesota at great expense and trouble in the nineteenth century, but once here, they became centers of genteel social life. Women who brought their pianos here were in great demand as teachers of aspiring young ladies and, sometimes, their parents. One mother sent her daughter skipping across the Mississippi River ice floes to her piano lesson on Nicollet Island. A Minnesota newspaper noted, in 1855, that parlor music was, \"a good calling for young ladies where they have no flax or wool to spin.\" Chippewa Indians building birchbark canoe -r\\linnes~ta Historical Society photo Quilting bee -,\\\\inne~()td Historical Society photo Training young women in the arts was central to the mission of the first female academies, which educated and \"refined\" the daughters of well-to-do pioneer families. These early schools, established and run by women, Catholic nuns, offered instruction in music, poetry, and dramatic reading, as well as in the \"womanly arts,\" such as ornamental needlework. In the 1850s, the literary arts established a irail foothold in Minnesota, and two women of note were professional writers: Julia Sargeant Wood wrote genteel women's fiction in her Sauk Rapids Frontierman, while Jane Grey Swisshelm wrote political tracts in the 51. Cloud Visiter. In 1856, a new magazine, The Social Wreath, appeared, \"published by the young ladies of Minneapolis.\" By the 1860s, a few women had become art instructors in Minnesota. They rented studios on the second stories of shops or gave lessons in their homes, exclusively to \"young ladies,\" because drawing was seen as a \"genteel accomplishment,\" and therefore suitable for women. Some art instructors did commercial art work as well, illustrating books, making decorated cards and wax flowers. Perhaps more important in terms of Minnesota's artistic future was the development, as early as the 1850s, of women's role as patrons and publicists of the arts. In 1852, the women of the Episcopal church in St. Paul raised money for a church organ, the first in the territory. In the century and a quarter that have followed, individual women and women's groups have performed similar functions over and over again. In musical, theatrical, and artistic organizations, Minnesota women have served as administrators, lobbyists, and fundraisers. Early in the twentieth century, the Minnesota Federation of Women's Clubs lobbied successfully for the formation of a State Art Commission that would lend state support to the arts. In the Twin Cities, the Schubert Club and Thursday Musical brought distinguished talent to Minnesota and provided opportunities for local artists to perform. These clubs and others like them, staffed almost exclusively by women, also provided scholarships for promising young musicians to pursue further study. Nearly two-thirds of the charter membership of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts consisted of women, and in the society's early exhibitions of local work, nearly all pieces were owned by women. 13 ( 14 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE Yet the many Minnesotans who carried out these supportive and promotional functions were, for the most part, as anonymous as the Indian women who pursued their native crafts. Onlya few individuals have attained even local reputations as either patrons or practitioners of the arts in Minnesota. One who did was Verna Scott of the University of Minnesota. She established the University Artists Course in 1919 and staged the first faculty art show on the campus. In 1930 she became the manager of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and hired, as conductors, first Eugene Ormandy and then Dimitri Mitropoulos. ''I'll admit it is an unusual job for a woman,\" she confessed to an interviewer, \"but I had the musical and business training, and I cultivated tact. A wider reputation was achieved by Wanda Gag, the artist and illustrator born of Bohemian parents in New Ulm, Minnesota. Her drawings and lithographs hang in museums in Europe and America, and her children's books have become classics. A more recent artist, Evelyn Raymond, won national attention with her prize-winning sculpture of Maria Sanford, which stands in Statuary Hall in the nation's Capitol. Several Minnesota authors have earned distinction for their fiction, both adult and juvenile. Among them are Maud Hart Lovelace, Margaret Culkin Banning, Grace Flandrau, and Carol Ryrie Brink. At the turn of the twentieth century, .the arts and crafts movement flourished throughout the United States, and in Mi\"nnesota it found expression in the Handicraft Guild of Minneapolis. Inspired by the English scholar and writer John Ruskin, who deplored the cheap and shoddy nature of machine-made goods, the Handicraft Guild was made up almost entirely of women. It conducted classes and lectures and provided studios for artists who wished to bring the beauty of good design into the articles of daily existence. The arts were reunited with craftsmanship and utility, as they had been in the pioneer homes and Indian villages of early Minnesota. This was by no means, however, a grass-roots movement drawing upon earlier traditions. Not until recent years have Minnesotans in significant numbers taken a serious look at the aesthetic qualities to be found in the art forms practiced by women of several cultures in the state. Beadwork, quilting, pottery and needlepoint have begun to earn recognition as serious art. At the same time, the distinctions between \"man's work\" and \"woman's work\" in the arts has begun to break down: no longer must women orchestral musicians play the harp orviolin. No longer are women performers suspected of moral defects, and women like Loyce Houlton and Nancy Hauser lead dance companies that are widely admired. Concep\u00ad tions of art and beauty have expanded in company with increased recognition of the multiplicity of contributions Minnesota women have made to the visual arts, literature, music, dance, and theater. Minnesota Women .. , in Social Service and Reform One of the few accepted roles for women outside the home in nineteenth-century society was that of ministering to the poor, the sick, the aged, and the unfortunate. At first this was carried on largely through churches in which women played industrious but always subordinate parts. As time passed, social needs called for a broader approach, and various social service agencies and institutions were founded, most of which were staffed and some of which were managed by women. Constant contact with those who suffered from the results of neglect and injustice led many of these women to turn from simply performing charitable work to demanding that society be reformed along more fair and humanitarian lines. This evolution can be followed in Minnesota from the.earliest missionary work among the Sioux and Chippewa Indians through the founding of old people's homes, orphanages, and hospitals to the activities of twentieth-century social reformers working through settlement houses. and various voluntary agencies and organizations to achieve changes in the fabric of society. Nineteenth-century missionaries worked within an ethnoce,ltric, proselytizing framework, and from today's point of view they may appear to have done more harm than good by their concerted attack upon Native American cultures and values. Nevertheless, the individual women and men who engaged in this work were often motivated by the highest humanitarian ideals. From the beginning women formed an important part of the missionary movement. Numbers of them came to Minnesota as teachers and nurses, and some added to those tasks the role of wife and housekeeper to male missionaries. Women frequently proved more successful than men in establishing relationships across cultural barriers, and those like Hester Crooks Boutwell and Catharine Bissell Ely, who themselves had a Native American heritage, were especially influential among women of the bands they and their husbands served. With the coming of white settlement churches turned to the task of supplying help and counsel to the indigent in frontier communities that were almost entirely lacking in organized social services. Men gave financial support, but it was usua'lIy women who provided the initiative and labor. In 1867 a group of St. Paul church women agreed to establish a \"home for the friendless,\" and to serve that purpose they raised money and purchased a house in 1869. For many years it continued.as a refuge for the destitute (mostly women and children), for the sick, and for the aged. Eventually, still under the management of a largely female board, it evolved into an old people's home, and it existed until recently Gertrude Brown with children at Phyllis Wheatley House ~Minnesota Historical Chll ..... h \"\" .,. ,..l\\lInncupnli\", Campaign buttons marking women's political/social activities present unofficial symbols of an aspect of Minnesota tradition. -~orth Star Chapteroi American Political Items Collectors photo most, the Protestant Home is only typical of many such enterprises, founded and largely managed by women and supported through subscriptions, fund drives, bazaars, ice cream socials, and countless hours of volunteer work. They supplemented and provided a measuring stick for the public institutions established and maintained by taxpayers. A number of these charitable efforts were started by various orders of nuns, and the latter are also associated with many of the state's earliest and most outstanding hospitals. Among these are St. Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul, founded in 1854, and St. Mary's in Rochester, whose guiding spirit, Mother Alfred Moes of the Sisters of St. Francis, worked side by side with the Mayo brothers in making Rochester a world renowned medical center. A more specialized hospital, and one which took a step in the direction of social reform as well as service, was opened in Minneapolis in 1887. Maternity Hospital was founded by Dr. Martha G. Ripley to meet the need for lying-in facilities for the city's unwed mothers. No Minneapolis hospital would then admit them, operating on the philosophy that such young women deserved punishment rather than help. Maternity Hospital also undertook to serve married women who could not afford to go elsewhere and to care for destitute or unwanted children born in the institution. The hospital's only nonamendable article of incorporation provided that the medical department was to be under the care and control of female physicians. Until its closing in 1956 Maternity Hospital maintained an outstanding record of maternal health and also led the way among Minnesota institutions in combining enlightened social service with medical care. With growing urbanization the need for social services expanded and changed. Early in the twentieth century the settlement house movement took root in Minnesota, and at the same time came efforts to revise laws in order to protect the helpless and disadvantaged from the crushing forces of an increasingly impersonal and complex society. Women found that these movements were a natural extension of the charitable work they had been engaged in for generations, and their long experience sometimes resulted in positions of leadership. In 1916 when Governor J. A. A. Burnquist appointed a Child Welfare Commission of 12 members to study, revise, and codify the state's hodgepodge of laws concerning juveniles, he included three women. Among them was Catheryne Cooke Gilman, whose background of social settlement work in Chicago, New York, and northeast Minneapolis qualified her to playa substantial part in the work of the commission. She was also the leading spirit in the Women's Cooperative Alliance, an organization dedicated to encouraging a wholesome moral climate in Minneapolis and especially to protecting young women and children from the evils of an urban environment and the prejudices of a male-dominated legal system. At the height of its influence in the early 1920s, the Alliance employed a staff of two dozen workers and had a network of neighborhood committees that covered the entire city. It introduced a \"Big Sister\" program, held parent-education classes, and pushed for a stronger women's division in the police department along with reform of the laws governing prostitution and rape. Women have also played key roles in developing the neighborhood centers that helped give a sense of unity and common purpose to the growing minority communities within the Twin 17 18 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE Cities. The names of Gertrude Brown, first director of the Phyllis Wheatley House in Minneapolis, and of I. Myrtle Carden, who devoted twenty years between 1929 and 1949 to St. Paul's Hallie Q. Brown House, are significant in the story of how Minnesota's Black citizens made the transition from a small, conservative, and highly segregated group to an important and vocal element within the state's urban population. More recently the growing pride and self-awareness of the Twin Cities' Mexican-American community has been stimulated by the educational and cultural program of the Guadalupe Area Project on St. Paul's West Side, under the direction of Sister M. Giovanni of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Minnesota Women ... in Politics and Government In Minnesota, as elsewhere, the deep interest of women in social reform led them into political activity long before they were permitted to vote or hold office. It was abhorrence of human slavery that caused lane Grey Swisshelm, a newspaper editor from 5t. Cloud, to attack in print the Democratic bosses of Minnesota Territory in the 1850s. Their supporters mobbed her newspaper office, threw her press into the Mississippi, threatened her with personal violence, and burned a straw effigy of her labeled \"The Mother of the Republican Party.\" Nevertheless, she continued to lecture throughout Minnesota and to publish blistering diatribes against slavery and the politicians who supported it. Swisshelm was only one of many women whose concern for the injustices suffered by Black people led them to challenge also a society which denied women equal rights with men. She talked to frontier audiences on the need for women to be active in politics and in 1862 lectured before the Minnesota Senate on the legal disabilities of women. Time passed and issues changed, but when waves of farm protest and populism washed across Minnesota in the 1880s and 1890s, the state produced another woman who, like Swisshelm, ignored the limitations of disenfranchisement and preached the cause of social justice in the political arena. As State Lecturer of the Farmers Alliance and one of the founders of the Minnesota State Federation of Labor, Eva McDonald Valesh, a young journalist and union organizer from Minneapolis, wrote and spoke throughout Minnesota about the common interests of the farmer and the laborer. She demanded to know why farmers \"are the hardest working and poorest paid class in the country .. why the railroad corporations, real estate speculators, stock gamblers and professional politicians grow enormously wealthy without doing any work at all . why farmers' wives are so often broken down and fill the insane asylums and hospitals.\" And when in 1891 she became a national lecturer for the People's party, she defended the right of a woman to speak on the political platform \"as long as there are homeless, voiceless women, helpless to cope with the hard conditions of life.\" Meanwhile the movement for women's suffrage was slowly gathering strength in Minne\u00ad sota. Its leaders tended to be Anglo-Americans, prosperous and well educated, often professional women or the wives and daughters of prominent men. Among them, over the years, were names like Sarah B. Stearns, Mary I. Colburn, Harriet Bishop, Charlotte O. Van Cleve, Charlotte S. Winchell, Dr. Martha G. Ripley, Maud C. Stockwell, and Clara H. Ueland, as well as many others. In 1875 Minnesota's male voters approved an amendment which gave their sisters the right to vote and run for office in school elections. Many, however, may not have realized what they were doing. Skillful lobbying by leaders of the women's rights movement succeeded in getting the measure identified on the ballots only as \"Amendment to Article 7,\" with an automatic \"yes\" unless the voter scratched it out and wrote \"no.\" Even so, the amendment passed by only 4,000 votes, with nearly 20,000 men taking the trouble to vote against it. A gradual shift of opinion had become apparent by 1898, however, when a similar amendment applying to libraries passed easily and almost without opposition. In the years after 1900 the cause of women's suffrage became linked with the sweeping tide in American life known as progressivism and was identified in the public mind with measures like prohibition, civic reform, and protective laws for workers, especially working women and children. Suffragists eagerly accepted this association and appealed to the nation to \"give the vote to mothers\" in order that their supposed idealism and instinct for housecleaning might be extended to the whole community. In 1914 Clara Ueland, then president of the Minnesota Equal Suffrage Association, wrote: \"Mothers, from the beginning, have been the dynamic force that makes for better homes and thus for a higher civilization .... This intensive concern for home should be expressed in government.\" But Minnesota legislators did not see it that way. In 1911 they had defeated a suffrage amendment introduced by State Senator Ole Sageng, and it was not until March, 1919, that they yielded to the nationwide trend and gave women the right to vote in presidential elections. In September of the same year Minnesota became the fifteenth state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Among the dedicated younger suffragists who celebrated that day was Anna Dickie Olesen of Cloquet, and with the final adoption of the amendment, she, like others, accepted along with full citizenship the responsibility for political activism. She was Minnesota's first national Democratic committeewoman, and in 1922 she became the first female candidate for the United States Senate ever to be endorsed by a major party. Running far ahead of the trailing Democratic ticket, she conducted a campaign which, although unsuccessful, aroused respect throughout the state. The same election year sent four women to the Minnesota legislature: Myrtle A. Cain, Sue M. Dickey Hough, and Mabeth Hurd Paige, all of Minneapolis, and Hannah J. Kempfer from Erhard in Otter Tail County. Representatives Cain and Hough served one term, but Paige went on to serve through 1943 (11 terms) and Kempfer through 1941, losing one election, that of 1930, during those ye~rs. Sally Luther of Minneapolis, who served from 19S1 to 1961; Helen E. McMillan of Austin, 1963-1973; and Rosanna C Payne of Deer River and Ball Club, 1927-1931, are the only other female representatives to have held office more than two terms. Laura E. Naplin was the first woman senator, elected to two four-year terms in 1926 and 1930. Ramsey County League of Women Voters in Washington, D. A total of 27 women have served in the Minnesota House and Senate since 1923, making only 2 per cent of the legislature's membership during those years. The number serving at anyone time has varied from none in 1945,1947, and 1949 to eight in 1975. They have generally been identified with legislation concerning health, welfare, and education. Paige worked vigorously for the establishment of mental\u00b7 hospitals, and Kempfer played an active role in the area of fish and game conservation, protection, and management. Several worked for fair employment practices legislation, and Representative Luther spoke out for the appointment of a woman to the University of Minnesota board of regents, leading to the naming of Marjorie J. Howard to the post in 1953. But because of their small numbers and generally short time in office, women as a group have not had substantial impact on the legislature until recently. Despite the trail blazed with such spirit\" by Anna Dickie-Olesen, no Minnesota woman has yet been elected to the United States Senate, and it was not unti11954, more than thirty years after women's suffrage was achieved, that the state sent a female representative to congress. In that year the Ninth Congressional District.elected Coya G_ Knutson, a Red River Valley schoolteacher and veteran of four years in the legislature_ She served two terms in Washington and was the first woman appointed to the House Agriculture Committee. Until 1974 the only woman to hold one of the major state executive offices was Virginia Holm, who followed her husband Mike-Holm.as Secretary of State in 1952 and served one term. No woman has yet,been seated on the Minnesota Supreme Court, although the position of Clerk was held by Grace Kaercher Davis for 29 years and by Mae Sherman for 13. Nor has a \u00b7woman yet served as mayor of any of the state's major cities. Minnesota women's efforts to achieve election to public office have been accompanied by increase in the extent of influence they have wielded within party organizations. Although the majority of them have been limited to the volunteer labor-force-the .brigade of envelope-stuffers, telephone-callers, and coffee-brewers-a few have played important policy-making roles. Susie W. Stageberg of..Red Wing was Farmer Labor party candidate for secretary of state in 1922,1924, and 1928 and ran for congress in 1932. Mar-ian W. Le Sueur served on the executive board of the Farmer Labor party in the late 1930s, edited the party organ, the Minnesota Leader, and was chairwoman of the Democratic Farmer Labor party from\u00b71944 to 1948_ Independent Republican Jean Wittich of Minneapolis organized the All Party Volunteer Committee which helped secure the election of Floyd B. Olson as governor 21 in 1930, and she served in several appointive positions within his administration. Among a later generation of Republicans, Elizabeth E. Heff-elfinger in the 1950s and Rhoda Lund in the 1960s achieved genuine influence and nationwide recognition as national committeewom- en from Minnesota. Democrat Eugenie M. Anderson of Red Wing played an important role in the turbuleritaffairs of the DFL party during the late 1940s and ran against Eugene J. McCarthy in the primary election for United States Senator in 1958. Women have \u00b7exerted influence through various nonpartisan political action groups. The League of Women Voters of Minnesota was founded in 1919 to promote active and informed participation of citiz-ens in government. Women members have been active in research on public policy issues and public information projects, and their lobby efforts have State The Red (pinus resinosa) or Norway Pine became the official state tree in Tr.ee. 1953. It is a tall stately-tree which reaches a height of 60 to 100 feet. The trunk is straight and\u00b7 uniform-and may grow to three to five feet in diameter. It is _usually bare of branches for fwo-thirds-ofthe way up the trunk, with the -top or crown rounded. 22 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE State The Loon (gavia immer) became Minnesota's state bird in 1961. It is also Bird known as the Common Loon and the Great Northern Diver. The Loon is a large bird, with wing spans up to five feet and body lengths up to three feet. Its beautiful call is easily distinguished over Minnesota lakes. State The Walleye (stizostedion v. vitreum) is found throughout Minnesota in Fish lakes and rivers but is most at home in the large, clear, cool lakes of Minnesota's northern forests. It attains a weight of 18 pounds, has flesh of the highest quality and is any angler's prize. About half of Minnesota's fishing water is managed primarily for walleye fishing. swayed the course of state and local decision-making by elected and appointed public officials. Minnesota has supplied national leadership in groups devoted to international understanding through women like Fanny F. Brin, who was an official United States observer at the U.N. charter conference in 1945. Eugenie Anderson became the first American woman appointed to ambassadorial rank, serving as ambassador to Denmark from 1949 to 1953, as minister to Bulgaria from 1962 to -1964, and as United States representative on the U.N. Trusteeship Council from 1965 to -1967. A new era began with the resurgent women's movement of the early 19705. The National Women's Political Caucus was formed in July, 1971, and a month later a Minnesota chapter was organized. Drawing multipartisan support and committed to no political party, the new group was dedicated to advancing women as candidates for political office and supporting measures in which women have a particular stake. In 1972 six women were elected to the state House of Representatives. Most of them had been active in feminist organizations and all six voted for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was ratified by the Minnesota legislature in 1973. This was in significant contrast to the record of fifty years earlier. In 1923 three of the four women in the legislature had opposed the same amendment. Experience during the campaign for passage of the ERA led many politically active women to feel that working within political parties would be more effective than through nonpartisan groups identified with issues. In April, 1973, a feminist caucus was organized within the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party and two months later Republican women formed a similar group. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Women's Political Caucus has continued to be active, creating local chapters in several counties and working for political effectiveness despite the wide spectrum of opinion among Minnesota women concerning feminist issues and party loyalties. In 1974 State Representative Joan Anderson Growe was nominated for secretary of state by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party and elected in the general election_ The year 1~74 marked the return to nomination and election of state legislators with party designa\u00ad tion; seven women were elected. Second woman to serve in the state senate since statehood, Nancy Brataas (Republican, District 33) was elected in a special election, February, 1975. Much more far-reaching, however, than offices, laws, and election statistics has been the swift change within the past decade in how women look upon themselves and upon their history. Still within the memory of living persons is the time when the very appearance of a woman or a woman', name in a public context was considered inappropriate and faintly shocking; when woman and her entire sphere of life were defined as private, and therefore not the stuff of history. The emerging study of sociology and social history has changed that to a degree, yet the full story of women in Minnesota (and elsewhere) has still to be studied and told. The bits and pieces of it which appear in the historical record are too often 24 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE centered around those few intrepid and gifted individuals who refused to be defined out of the world of public affairs and therefore out of history. The real story of women is far more than the chronicle of a few eminent persons. It is the record of how this second half of the human race lived, worked, thought; how they reacted to the tides and currents of their times; and how their thousands of unnoticed and unrecorded decisions affected the direction of events. As this brief and superficial review suggests, they have played an enormous but mostly unrecognized role in the development of Minnesota from its earliest beginnings. Present residents of the North Star State have only begun to sense the depth, variety, and fascination of the story. A MINNESOTA CHRONICLE Minnesotans on the eve of the American Revolution Bicentennial look back upon those same two hundred years-and more-in the history of their state. Since what is past is prologue to the future, the following chronology is offered as an introduction to Minnesota's role in the nation's third century: Exploration and Territory 1654-1857 Early Statehood 1858 -1898 Growth and Development 1899 -1950 Into the Future 1951 -1975 Exploration and Territory 1654 -1857 The earliest-probable explorers to reach Minnesota were French traders Radisson and Groseilliers in 1654. In 1679 Daniel Greysolon DuLhut (Duluth) held a council with the Sioux (Dakota) near Mille Lacs Lake. He met Father Louis Hennepin at the Mississippi after .. traveling down the 51. Croix River the following year. That same year, 1680, Father Hennepin, after being held captive in a village of the Mille Lacs Sioux, discovered the Falls of 51. Anthony. On May 8, 1689, Nicholas P.errot, at Fort 51. Antoine, on the Wisconsin shore of take Pepin, laid formal claim to the surrounding county for France. He also built a fort on the Minnesota shore of this lake, near its outlet. Between 1689 and 1736, the French continued to develop forts and settlements in Minnesota such as Isle Pelee in 1695, Fort L'Huillier in 1700, Fort Beauharnois near Frontenac in 1727 and Forts St. Pierre and St. Charles in extreme northern Minnesota established in 1731. In 1745 the Chippewa won the most decisive battle in the war with the Sioux at the great Sioux village of Kathio on the western shore of Mille Lacs. The Sioux were eventually driven onto the western plains by the Chippewa. The Versailles Treaty of 1763, following the French-Indian War, ceded the French territory east of the Mississippi River to England. France had ceded its area west of the Mississippi to Spain in 1762. Following the Revolutionary War, the North West Company became important in the fur trade and Grand Portage became its headquarters in 1784. By 1797 the Minnesota area of the Northwest Territory had been mapped by North West trader David Thompson. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson purchased that part of Minnesota lying west of the Mississippi River, from Napoleon Bonaparte in the Louisiana Purchase.

Designed by Valerie Pettis, this official emblem illustrates the themes of IWY: Equality, Development, Peace. 26 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE During the War of 1812, the Sioux, Chippewa and Winnebago joined the English. Following the War of 1812, the United States established Fort St. Anthony (renamed Fort Snelling in 1825) in 1819 to protect the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers. The first steamboat arrived at Fort Snelling on May 10, 1823. In the same year American explorer Stephen H. Long visited the Minnesota River, the Red River, and the Northern frontier In 1832 Henry R. Schoolcraft discovered the source of the Mississippi river and named it Lake Itasca. In 1836 after Michigan became a state, Minnesota became part of the territory of Wisconsin. This same year, joseph N. Nicollet began his explorations into Minnesota. In 1837, Governor Dodge of Wisconsin signed a treaty at Fort Snelling with the Chippewa, by which they ceded all their pine lands on the St. Croix and its tributaries. A treaty was also sigiled at Washington, D.C. with representatives of the Sioux for their lands east of the Mississippi. These\u00b7treaties led the way to the first settlements within the area of Minnesota. The following year, Franklin Steele established a claim at the Falls of St. Anthony (Minneapolis) and Pierre Parrant built a shanty and settled on the present site of the city of St. Paul, then called \"Pig's Eye\". The \"Chapel of St. Paul\" was built and consecrated in 1841, giving the name to the future capitol of the state. On August 26, 1848, after the admission of Wisconsin to the Union, the \"Stillwater Convention\" adopted measures calling for a separate territorial organization, and asked that the new territory be named Minnesota. Two months later, on October 30, Henry Hastings Sibley was elected delegate to Congress. In 1849 Minnesota was organized as a territory and the first territorial legislature assembled on September 3. By \u00b71850 commercial steamboating was inaugurated on the Minnesota River. The first U.S. census was taken in the Minnesota territory and recorded a population of 6,077 in \u00b71850. In 1851 SI. Paul, St. Anthony, and Stillwater were selected for the locations of capitol, university, and penitentiary. During the \u00b71850'5 a number of organizations were established to encourage the importation of blooded stock and the introduction of choice seeds, grain and fruit trees to the territory. In \u00b71853 W. A. Gorman was appointed governor and the first capitol was constructed. In 1854 commercial flour milling began in Minneapolis. Large scale immigration began in the mid 1850's and a real estate boom resulted. The first bridge to span the main channel of the Mississippi River anywhere along its length was opened in Minneapolis in \u00b71855. 1857 saw the beginning of moves to establish the state government in Minnesota. The Minnesota Enabling Act was passed by Congress on February 26. Governor Samuel Medary, who had been appointed by President james Buchanan, arrived on April 22. The legislature passed a bill to move the state capitol to SI. Peter, but since the bill was stolen before it was filed with the territorial secretary of state, the move to SI. Peter never came about. On july 13 the Constitutional Convention assembled. There had been such a rift between Democrats and Republicans that two constitutions were adopted. The Constitution was adopted and the state officers elected on October 3, 1857. Minnesota had a population of \u00b7150,037 at thjs time. On May 11, \u00b71858, Minnesota entered the Union as the 32nd state. At the time of its entry, Minnesota was the third largest state in the Union-only Texas and California were larger Early Statehood 1858-1898 At the beginning of the Civil War, Governor Alexander Ramsey wired Lt. Gov. Ignatius Donnelly to begin to organize volunteers from the state to fight in the war. On April \u00b714, 186\u00b71, Ramsey oiiered President Lincoln\u00b7l ,000 men giving Minnesota the distinction of being the first state to offer troops to the Union cause. The first Minnesota regiment left Fort Snelling on June 22, 1861. On July 2, 1862, the first railroad was opened in Minnesota between Minneapolis and St. Paul. During the Sioux uprising of the late summer of 1862, a number of settlements were attacked. A military commission tried 392 Indians for murder, rape, and other charges, and 303 of them were condemned. On December 26, 1862, 38 Indians were hanged at Mankato. At the battle of Gettysburg on July 2, 1862, the First Minnesota Regiment made its famous charge and within 15 minutes 215 of the 262 men were killed or wounded. On July 3, Chief Little Crow, Sioux leader of the Sioux Uprising, was killed near Hutchinson. At the close of the Civil and Indian Wars, the Minnesota troops totaled 21,982. The University of Minnesota was opened in 1866 with William W. Folwell as its first president. The development by Edmund N. LaCroix of the middlings purifier for flour helped expand the development of Minnesota, the Dakotas and western Canada. The Legislative Amendment providing for biennial sessions was passed in 1877. On March 1,188'1, the first state capitol burned. A second state capitol was'built on the same spot. The legislature moved into the second capitol in January, 1883. The first iron ore was shipped from Minnesota in 1884. The first mine was the Soudan mine on the Vermillion Range. Iron was first discovered on the Mesabi Range 6 years later in 1890 and that range shipped its first iron in 1892. In 1893 the legislature appointed a Capitol Commission to select a site for and erect a new state capitol building. Killer forest fires started on September 1, 1894, destroying over 400 sq. miles of area near Hinckley and Sandstone. Three-fourths of the Red Lake Indian Reservation was opened for settlement in 1896. The cornerstone on the new state capitol was laid 9n July 27, 1898. Minnesota was the first state to respond to the President's call for volunteers in the Spanish-American War. Minnesota supplied four regiments for service. Growth and Development 1899 -1950 During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the tide of immigration into the state swelled. The most notable origin of this movement was Germany, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The other migrations from Southern and Eastern Europe contributed to a lesser degree to the state's population increase. In '1909 President Theodore Roosevelt issued a proclamation establishing Superior National Forest. In 1911 the legislature ratified the proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for the direct election of U.S. Senators. Minnesota became the first state in 1913 to adopt a non-partisan system of electing its legislators. During World War I, l'vlinnesota contributed 123,325 troops. On October 12-13, 1918, forest fires spread over large parts of Carlton an'd southern St. Louis counties taking 432 lives. In 1925 a general reorganization of the state government occurred. In '1930 Minnesotan Frank B. Kellogg, U.S. Secretary of State, was awarded the 1929 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact signed in Paris in 1928. The purpose of the Pact was to outlaw war. Floyd B. Olson was elected as the first Farmer-Labor governor of Minnesota in 1930. State population at this time was 2,563,953. 27 28 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE In 1931 Sinclair Lewis of Sauk Centre was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the election of 1932 al19 of Minnesota's representatives were. elected at large. In '1933 the legislature passed a Reapportionment Act, dividing the state into 9 congressional districts. As the depression worsened in 1933-34, federal and state projects were provided to assist the large numbers of unemployed. The Old Age Assistance Act became effective March 1, 1936. In 1937, The Pipestone National Monument was established to protect the Indians' sacred quarry near Pipestone. In 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, the Minnesota National Guard and the Naval Reserve were ordered to duty with the armed forces. The great wartime demand for mi litary equipment led to the Minnesota iron ore mines' production for 1943, of 83,960,822 tons of ore, the largest single year's tonnage in their history. As a result of a special session of the legislature in 1944, persons in the armed forces were permitted to vote. Also in 1944 the Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties merged to form the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. The 1946 value of crops in Minnesota was at a high of $683,000,000. In 1947 the Youth Conservation Act was passed providing for methods of treatment, training and education of young persons with a view toward the prevention of crime and delinquency. In 1948, for the first time, the value of manufactured products exceeded cash farm receipts in the state. The 1950 population of Minnesota was\u00b72,982,483. Into the Future 1951 -1975 In 1951, Minnesota produced 82% of. the nation's total iron ore output. That year Minnesota produced a new record-89,564,932 tons of iron ore. The DFL won 7 of 8 statewide races in the 1954 general election to mark its first major victory. In 1956 the E. W. Davis Works of the Reserve Mining Company at Silver Bay was dedicated, inaugurating larg;-scale production of taconite in Minnesota. A year long centennial celebration was held in 1958 marking the first 100 years of Minnesota statehood. Grand Portage National Monument was established to protect one of the nation's foremost inland centers of 18th and 19th century fur trading. Oceanic trade began with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. This significant event made Duluth accessible to ocean vessels from anywhere in the world. In the state's closest race for governor, after more than four months of recounts, Karl F. Rolvaag was sworn in as governor on March 25, 1963. He was declared the willner by 91 votes. Hubert H. Humphrey became the first Minnesotan to obtain national elective office when he was sworn in as President Lyndon B. Johnson's vice president on January 20, 1965. The spring of 1965 saw the worst flooding in the state's history. In 1967 the legislature created the nation's first Human Rights Department. The Metropoli\u00ad tan Council was also established in 1967. Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey, in 1968, became the first Minnesotan nominated by a major party for President of the United States. President Nixon, in 1969, named Warren Burger of St. Paul as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Harry Blackmun of Rochester was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1970. That year, the 150th anniversary of Fort Snelling was marked. A Constitutional Amendment lowering the voting age to 19 years was approved by Minnesota voters in November. Also in 1970, the u.s. Congress authorized Voyageurs National Park. The population of Minnesota was 3,805,069. The Minnesota legislature became the first in the nation to ratify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution lowering the voting age to 18 years. The longest \"extra session\" in the history of the Minnesota Legislature adjourned October 30, 1971. In 1972, the DFL, which already was in control of the Governor's office, gained control of both the Senate and the House. The 1973 legislature repealed a 60 year old law providing for the nonpartisan election of legislators and restored party designation. The legislature also provided for statewide voter registration. In the 1974 statewide general election the DFL strengthened its leadership in the legislature and also gained control of all statewide offices. The state noted in 1974the death of Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr., a native of Little Falls, who was world renowned for being the first person to fly across the Atlantic Ocean alone. The worst blizzard of the century swept through Minnesota on January 11,1975, with the lowest barometric pressure reading ever recorded; spring and early summer flooding, especially in the Red River Valley, caused millions of dollars' in crop damage. In early July the 7th known earthquake in state history was recorded in a large area of west-central Minnesota. -Minnesota Historical Society photo troill a rXllfltlng of Fort Snelling in 1H44 by J.

Maps illustrating the several boundaries and hegemony of four soverign nations over the land area now known as Minnesota are reprinted from Minnesota Under Four Flags by Mary W. Berthel, published by the Minnesota Historical Society. Minnesota Under Four Nations The land area of Minnesota has at various times been under the governments of four nations-France, Spain, England and the United States. The early territorial claims of France, Spain and England were vague and overlapping. Formal government was nonexistent. Formal dominion over this area was probably first expressed by the French when in 1671 the Sieur de Lusson, in a picturesque ceremony held at the Sault de Ste. Marie, claimed for France the vast northwest area of North America. 31 32 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE However, British dominion over northeastern Minnesota appears to have provided the first written constitution nominally in effect in the land area of Minnesota. This occurred when Minnesota was made a part of the Province of Quebec under the Quebec Act of 1774. But England's claim to this area was not exclusive inasmuch as Virginia maintained a claim to the same area under its colonial charter of 1609. Of Minnesota's land area the portion east of the Mississippi River was the first to come under the jurisdiction of the United States. This was established by the treaty of peace between England and the United States in 1783. Four years later, under the Ordinance of 1787, the first genuine government was extended to this area, and the Minnesota country began its march to statehood. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 One of the great charters in Minnesota history is the Northwest Ordinance passed by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787. The Ordinance of 1787 was made possible when several states, including Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Connecticut released their claims to the land area west of the Appalachian Mountains extending to the Mississippi River. This area became known as the Northwest Territory. The Ordinance of 1787 followed the fundamentals of Thomas Jefferson's Ordinance of 1784 and established a government over the Northwest Territory and gave impetus to the westward expansion of this nation. It was an outstanding governmental document. It gave first national recognition to the Bill of Rights, abolished primogeniture, provided for the encouragement of education, prohibited slavery, and established the great new principle that new states should be admitted to the federal government on equal footing with the original states. The full effect of the Northwest Ordinance upon Minnesota law has yet to be determined. For example, the question of whether common law in Minnesota dates from the Revolution or from the Ordinance of 1787 has been left open by decisions of the Minnesota courts. The Ordinance provided for the formation out of the Northwest Territory of not less than three nor more than five states. These states were to be admitted to the federal government on an equal footing with the original states. By May of 1848 five states had been formed out of the Northwest Territory-Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. The State of Wisconsin was organized out of the Territory of Wisconsin, the last remnant of the Northwest Territory. Although in 1848 the Territory of Wisconsin extended to the Mississippi River, the State of Wisconsin voluntarily limited its we\"tern boundary to the SI. Croix River. This boundary limitation by the State of Wisconsin left the land area between the St. Croix and the Mississippi available for eventual inclusion in the State of Minnesota. Thus it is that the State of Minnesota can trace much of its fundamental governmental principles, and a substantial portion of its territory, back to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. NORTHWEST ORDINANCE 1787 Act of Congress, July 13,1787 An Ordinance for the government of the territory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio. Be it ordained by the United States, in Congress assembled, That the said territory, for the purpose of temporary government, be one district, subject, however, to be divided into two districts, as future circumstances may, in the opinion of Congress, make it expedient. 2. Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the estates both of resident and non-resident proprietors in the said territory, dying intestate, shall descend to, and be distributed among, their children and the descendants of a deceased child in equal parts, the descendants of a deceased child or grandchild to take the share of their deceased parent in equal parts among them; and where there shall be no children or descendants, then in equal parts to the next of kin, in equal degree; and among collaterals, the children of a deceased brother or sister of thei ntestate shall have, in equal parts among them, their deceased parent's share; and there shall, in no case, be a distinction between kindred of the whole and half blood: saving in all cases to the widow of the intestate her third part of the real estate for life, and one-third part of the personal estate; and this law, relative to descents and dower, shall remain in full force until altered by the Legislature of the district. And until the Governor and judges shall adopt laws, as hereinafter mentioned, es\u00ad tates in the said territory may be devised or bequeathed by wills in writing, signed and sealed by him or her in whom the estate may be, (being of full age), and attested by three witnesses; and real estates may be conveyed by lease and release, or bargain and sale, signed, sealed and delivered by the person, being of full age, in whom the estate may be, and attested by two witnesses, pro\u00ad vided such wills be duly proved, and such conveyances be acknowledged, or the execution thereof duly proved, and be recorded within one year after proper magistrates, courts, and registers, shall be appointed for that purpose; and personal property may be transferred by delivery, saving, however, to the French and Canadian inhabi\u00ad tants, and other settlers of the Kaskaskies, Saint Vin\u00ad cents, and the neighboring villages, who have heretofore professed themselves citizens of Virginia, their laws and customs now in force among them, relative to the descent and conveyance of property. 3. Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That there shall be appointed, from time to time, by Congress,.a Governor, whose commission shall continue in force for the term of three years, unless sooner revoked by Con\u00ad gress; he shall reside in the district, and have a freehold estate therein, in 1 ,000 acres of land, while in the exercise of his office. 4. There shall be appointed from time to time, by Congress, a Secretary, whose commission shall continue in force for four years, unless sooner revoked; he shall reside in the district, and have a freehold estate therein, in five hundred acres of land, while in the exercise of his office. It shall be his duty to keep and preserve the Acts and laws passed by the Legislature, and the public records of the district, and the proceedings of the Gover\u00ad nor in his executive department, and transmit authentic copies of such Acts and proceedings every six months, to the Secretary of Congress. There shall also be apPointed a court, to consist of three judges, any two of whom to form a court, who shall have a common law jurisdiction and reside in the district, and have each therein a freehold estate in five hundred acres of land, while in the exercise of their offices; and their commissions shall continue in force during good behavior. 5. The Governor and judges, or a majority of them, shall adopt and publish in the district such laws of the original States, criminal and civil, as may be necessary, and best suited to the circumstances of the district, and report them to Congress from timeto time, which laws shall be in force in the district until the organization of the General Assembly therein, unless disapproved of by Congress; but afterwards the Legislature shall have authority to alter them as they shall think fit. 6. The Governor, for the time being, shall be com\u00ad mander-in-chief of the militia, appoint and commission all officers in the same below the rank of general officers; all general officers shall be appointed and commissioned by Congress. 7. Previous to the organization of the general assembly, the Governor shall appoint such magistrates, and other civil officers, in each county or townShip, as he shall find necessary for the preservation of the peace and good order in the same. After the General Assembly shall be organized the powers and duties of magistrates and other civil officers shall be regulated and defined by the said assembly; but all magistrates and other civil officers, not herein otherwise directed, shall, during the continuance of this temporary government, be appointed by the Governor. 8. For the prevention of crimes and injuries, the laws to be adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district, and for the execution of process, criminal and civil, the Governor shall make proper divisions thereof; and he shall proceed, from time to time, as circumstances may require, to layout parts of the district in which the Indian titles shall have been extinguished, into counties and townships, subject, however, to such alterations as may thereafter be made by the Le,gislature. 9. So soon as there shall be five thousand free male inhabitants, of full age, in the district, upon giving proof thereof to the Governor, they shall receive authority, with the time and place, to elect Representatives from their counties or townships, to represent them in the General Assembly: Provided, that for every five hundred free male inhabitants there shall be one Representative, and soon, 33 34 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE progressively, with the number of free male inhabitants, shall the right of representation increase, until the number of Representatives shall amount to twenty-five; after which the number and proportion of Representa\u00ad tives shall be regulated by the legislature: Provided, that no person be eligible or qualified to act as a Representa\u00ad tive, unless he shall have been a citizen of one of the United States three years, and, in either case, shall likewise hold in his own right, in fee simple, two hundred acres of land within the same: Provided also, that a freehold in fifty acres of land in the district, having been a citizen of one of the States, and being resident in the district, or the like freehold and two years' residence in the district, shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector of a Representative. 10. The Representatives thus elected shall serve for the term of two years; and in case of the death of a Repre\u00ad sentative, or removal from office, the Governor shall issue a writ to the county or township, for which he was a member, to elect another in his stead, to serve for the residue of the term. 11.

The Legislative Council shall consist of five members, to continue in office five years, unless sooner removed by Congress; any three members of the council shall be nominated and appointed in the follow\u00ad ing manner, to wit: As soon as Representatives shall be elected the Governor shall appoint a time and place for them to meet together, and when met they shall nominate ten persons, resident in the district, and each possessed of a freehold in five hundred acres of land, and return their names to Congress, five of whom Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as aforesaid; and whenever a vacancy shall happen in the Council, by death or removal from office, the House of Representa\u00ad tives shall nominate two persons, qualified as aforesaid, for each vacancy, and return their names to Congress, one of whom Congress shall appoint and commission for the residue of the term; and every five years, four months at least before the expiration of the time of service of the members of the Council, the said House shall nominate ten persons, qualified as aforesaid, and return their names to Congress, five of whom Congress shall appoint and commission to serve as members of the Council five years, unless sooner removed. And the Governor, Legis\u00ad lative Council, and House of Representatives shall have authority to make laws in all cases for the good govern\u00ad ment of the district, not repugnant to the principles and articles in this Ordinance established and declared. And all bills, having passed by a majority in the House, and be a majority in the Council, shall be referred to the Gover\u00ad nor for his assent; but no bill or legislative Act whatever shall be of any force without his assent. The Governor shall have power to convene, prorogue, and dissolve the General Assembly when, in his opinion, it shall be expe\u00ad dient. 12. The Governor, judges, Legislative Council, Secre\u00ad tary, and such other officers as Congress shall appoint in the district. shall take an oath or affirmation of fidelity, and of office; the Governor before the President of Congress, and all other officers before the Governor. As soon as a legislature shall be formed in the district, the Council and House assembled, in one room, shall have authority, by joint ballot, to elect a delegate to Congress, who shall have a seat in Congress, with a right of debating, but not of voting, during this temporary gov\u00ad ernment. 13. And for extending the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty, which form the basis whereon these republics, their laws and Constitutions, are erected: to fix and establish those principles as the basis of all laws, Constitutions, and governments, which forever hereafter shall be formed in the said territory; to provide, also, for the establishment of States, and permanent government therein, and for their admission to a share in the federal councils on an equal footing with the original States, at as early periods as may be consistent with the general interest: 14. It is hereby ordained and declared, by the authority aforesaid, that the following articles shall be considered as articles of compact, between the original States and the people and States in the said territory, and forever remain unalterable, unless by common consent, to wit: Art. I. No person demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship, or religious sentiments in the said territories. Art. \u00b711. The inhabitants of the said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writs of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury; of a proportionate representation of the people in the Legislature, and of judicial proceed\u00ad ings according to the course of the common law. All persons shall be bailable, unless for capital offenses, where the proof shall be evident or the presumption great. All fines shall be moderate, and no cruel or unusual punishments shall be inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his liberty or property, but by the judment of his peers, or the law of the land, and should the public exigencies make it necessary, for the common preservation, to take any person's property, or to demand his particular ser\u00ad vices, full compensation shall be made for the same. And, in the just preservation of rights and property, it is understood and declared that no law ought ever to be made or have force in the said territory, that shall, in any manner whatever, interfere with or affect private con\u00ad tracts, or engagements bona fide and without fraud previously formed. Art. III. Religion, morality, and knowledge being neces\u00ad sary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in their property, rights and liberty they never shall be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall, from time to time, be made, for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them. Art. IV. The said territory, and the States which may be formed therein, shall forever remain a part of this Con\u00ad federacy of the United States of America, subject to the Articles of Confederation, and to such alterations therein as shall be constitutionally made; and to all the Acts and Ordinances of the United States in Congress assembled, conformable thereto. The inhabitants and settlers in the said territory shall be subject to pay a part of the federal\u00b7 debts, contracted, or to be contracted, and a proportional part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned on them by Congress, according to the same common rule and measure by which apportionments thereof shall be made on the other States, and the taxes for paying their proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the Legislatures of the district, or districts, or new States, as in the original States, within the time agreed upon by the United States in Congress assem\u00ad bled. The Legislatures of those districts, or new States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing the title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers. No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the United States: and in no case shall non-resident proprietors be taxed higher than residents. The navigable waters lead\u00ad ing in to the Mississippi and Saint Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other States that may be admitted into the Confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty there\u00ad for, Art. V. There shall be formed in the said territory not less than three nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the States, as soon as Virginia shall aiter her Act of cession, and consent to the same, shall become fixed and established as follows, to wit: The western State, in the said territory, shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Wabash and Post Vincents, due north, to the territorial line between the United States and Canada; and by the said territorial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The middle States shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash from Post Vincents to the Ohio, by the Ohio, by a direct line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami to the said territorial line, and by the said territorial line. The eastern State shall be bounded by the last mentioned direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line: Provided, however, and it is further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three States, shall be subject so far to be altered, that, if Congress shall hereafter find it expedient, they shafl have authority to form one or two States in that part of the said territory which lies north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake Michigan. And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatever; and shall be at liberty to form a permanent Constitution and State government: Provided, the Constitution and government, so to be formed, shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles contained in these Articles, and, so far as it can be consistent with the general interest of the Confederacy, such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thou\u00ad sand. Art. VI. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided always, that any person escap\u00ad ing into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in anyone of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid. Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the resoul\u00ad tions of the 23rd of April, 1784, relative to the subject of this Ordinance, be, and the same are hereby, repealed, and declared null and void. Done by the United States, in Congress assembled, the 13th day of July, in the year of our Lord 1787, and of their sovereignty and independence the 12th. The Organic Act of 1849 The Organic Act was passed by Congress on March 3, 1849, to provide for the Territorial Government of Minnesota. The boundaries of the territory of Minnesota were Canada on the north, Wisconsin on the east, Iowa on the south and the Missouri andWhite Earth Rivers on the west. The movement to create a Minnesota Territorial Government arose out of the necessity for formal government in the remnants of land area which remained after the formation of the states of Wisconsin and Iowa. Minnesota's land area west of the Mississippi was left without territorial government when the State of Iowa was formed out of the Territory of Iowa in 1846. The triangular area between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi River was left without territorial government when the State of Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848. Thus, by 1848 the land area from the St. Croix River west to the Missouri and White Earth Rivers was without territorial government-a veritable \"no man's land,\" 35 36 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE Consequently, when Henry H. Sibley was elected delegate to Congress from this area, he worked together with Senator Stephen A. Douglas, chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, to bring about the passage of the Organic Act for the establishment of a territorial government over this area-the Territory of Minnesota. The Organic Act provided for a governor, secretary, judicial system, legislative assembly and a delegate to Congress. Legislators and the delegate to Congress were elected; all other officers were appointive. The Legislative Assembly consisted of two houses, a council composed of nine members and a house of representatives with eighteen members. The first session of the Legislature convened on September 3, 1849, in the Central House at the corner of Bench and Minnesota Streets in St. Paul. Since that time St. Paul has been the capital of Minnesota. However, in 1857 a bill was introduced in the territorial legislative assembly to have the capitol removed from St. Paul to St. Peter. This action was promoted by the East and West boundary group which contended that the boundary to be established for the State of Minnesota should extend from Wisconsin west to the Missouri River, with the north line of the state being just north of St. Paul. Although this bill passed both houses of the legislative assembly, it was stolen before it could be presented to the territorial governor for his signature. Thus, the bill failed to pass because of assembly member Joseph Rolette, who disappeared with the bill and held it until the close of the Legislative session. An important provision of the Organic Act was the reservation of sections 16 and 36 of each township for school purposes. Alexander Ramsey, a Whig, was the first Territorial Governor. He was followed by Willis A. Gorman and Samuel Medary, Democrats. Minnesota progressed under the territorial government, but many groups felt that progress would be accelerated if Minnesota were a state. Within a short time there arose a strong desire for statehood. ORGANIC ACT OF MINNESOTA An act to establish the Territorial Governinent of Minnesota (Passed March 3, 1849) SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That the executive Representatives of the United States of America in Con- power and authority in and over said Territory of Minne- gress assembled, That from and after the passage of this sot a shall be vested in a governor, who shall hold his act, all that part afthe territory of the United States which office for four years, and until his successor s~all be lies within the following limits, to-wit: Beginning in the aPPOinted and qualified, unless sooner removed by the Mississippi river at the point where the line of forty-three president of the United States.

The house of representatives shall, at its first session, consist of eighteen members, possessing the same qual\u00ad ification as prescribed for members of the council, and whose term of service shall continue one year. The number of councilors and representatives may be in\u00ad creased by the legislative assembly, from time to time, in proportion to the increase of population; provided, that the whole number shall never exceed fifteen councilors and thirty-nine representatives. An apportionment shall be made, as nearly equal as practicable, among the several counties or districts for the election of the council and representatives, giving to each section of the Terri\u00ad tory representation in the ratio of its population, Indians excepted, as nearly as may be. And the members of the council and of the house of representatives shall reside in and be inhabitants of the districts for which they may be elected, respectively. Previous to the first election, the governor shall cause a census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the several counties and districts of the Territory to be taken, and the first eleclion shall be held at such time and places and be conducted in such manner as the governor shall appoint and direct, and he shall, at the same time, declare the number of members of the council and house of representatives to which each of the counties and districts shall entitled under this act. The number of persons authorized to be elected having the highest number of votes, in each of said council districts for members of the council, shall be declared by the governor to be duly elected to the council, and the person or persons authorized to be elected, having the greatest number of votes for the house of representa\u00ad tives, equal to the number to which each county or district shall be entitled, shall also be declared by the governor to be duly elected members of the house of representatives; provided, that in case of a tie between two or more persons voted for, the governor shall order a new election to supply the vacancy made by such tie.

The Enabling Act Henry M. Rice, delegate to Congress from the Territory of Minnesota, at the opening of Congress in December, 1856, introduced a bill for an act to authorize a state government for Minnesota. The Rice bill proposed that the north, south and east boundaries of Minnesota be continued, and that the west boundary be established as a line beginning at a point in the center of the main channel of the Red River of the North at the Canadian Border and running south through Lake Traverse, through Big Stone Lake, to the Big Sioux River and to the northwest corner of Iowa. In place of the Big Sioux River Congress substituted a line from the outlet of Big Stone Lake due south to the Iowa border. Considerable controversy had arisen in the territory over proposed boundaries for the State of Minnesota. There were two general groups, the East and West group and the North and South group. The East and West group proposed the Missouri River as the west boundary, and a point just north of St. Paul as the north boundary. The Rice bill followed the proposal of the North and South group. 39 40 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE The bill for an enabling act was not without opposition in Congress. However, Minnesota again found a friend in Senator Stephen A. Douglas who was still chairman of the Senate committee on territories. The Enabling Act passed Congress and was approved on February 27,1857 In addition to establishing boundaries for the State of Minnesota, the Enabling Act provided for a constitutional convention and an election of delegates to that convention. It further provided that the following proposals be sumbitted for the consideration of the constitu\u00ad tional convention: that sections 16 and 36 of each township be reserved for school purposes; that 72 sections of land be reserved and set aside for a state university; that ten sections be granted to the state to complete and erect public buildings at the capitol; that all salt springs, not exceeding 12, be granted to the state for its use; and that five per centum of net proceeds from the sale by Congress of public lands lying within the State of Minnesota be paid to the state for public road purposes. The Enabling Act also authorized the State of Minnesota to have one Representative. in Congress and such additional Representatives as the population of the state would entitle it to at the current ratio of representation. For the purpose of determining the population the act authorized a census to be taken by the United States marshal for the Territory of Minnesota. The census was completed in October of 1857, population 150,037. ACT AUTHORIZING A STATE GOVERNMENT [Passed Feb. 26, 1857] SECTION 1.

The Minnesota Constitution The State of Minnesota is unique among constitutional governments in that it doesn't have a constitution-it has two. The circumstances wh ich gave rise to this historical anomaly depict the strong feeling for independent political thinking which has pervaded Minnesota politics since statehood. However, any thought of illegality because of two constitutions should be promptly dismissed, for the two instruments are substantially identical, and all challenges on this issue have been quickly overturned. The Constitutional Convention In accordance with the Enabling Act of February 26, 1857, an election was held on June 1, 1857, at which Republican and Democratic delegates were elected to the constitutional convention. When these delegates assembled in SI. Paul on July 13, 1857, to draft the Minnesota constitution, bitterness between the two parties was so intense that Republican delegates and Democratic delegates refused to meet in the same convention. As a result each party held separate sessions in different rooms of the first capitol building. The Democratic \"convention\" was presided over by Henry H. Sibley, later elected first 41 governor of Minnesota. The Republican \"convention\" was presided over first by John W. North, and later by SI. Andrew D. Balcombe. The political cleavage was so great that the two bodies never acted in joint meeting during the entire constitutional convention-July 13 to Aug. 29. The final work of writing the constitution was done through a conference committee composed of five conferees from each of the conventions. The conferees, by reporting to and receiving advice from their respective conventions, were able to draft a constitution that would be acceptable to both bodies. On August 28,1857, in spite of numerous protests by delegates, the report of the conference committee was adopted without amendment by both the Republican and Democratic conventions. However, when it came time to sign the constitution, the bitter feeling was still so intense that Democrats would not sign an instrument which bore Republican signatures, and the Republicans likewise objected to signing an instrument which bore the signatures of Democrats. The solution to this impasse is a credit to Minnesota political ingenuity-two constitutions. One constitution was written on wh ite paper and signed only by Republicans. The other constitution was written on blue-tinted paper and signed only by Democrats. Thus, on the twenty-ninth day of August, after seven weeks of political dispute and disagreement, the \"two\" conventions adjourned when as many members as could bring themselves to do so signed the copy of the constitution enrolled for their particular convention. 42 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE Both copies of the constitution are now in the custody of the Minnesota Archives Commission where they are being preserved as evidence of our fundamental law, and as testimony to a unique and exciting political history. Election to Accept the Constitution The schedule to the constitution provided for an election to be held on October 13,1857. At th'ls election the voters were to accept or reject the constitution. The ballots used for this purpose were printed to provide only for affirmative votes. A voter who wished to reject the constitution had to alter his ballot and write in a negative vote. The result-30,055 for acceptance and 571 for rejection. Approval by Congress The procedure for acquiring statehood not only requires a constitution to be approved by the voters of the proposed state, the constitution must also be approved by Congress. In December of 1857 the Minnesota constitution was submitted to the United States Senate for ratification. A certified copy of the Democratic constitution was transmitted to the Senate by the territorial secretary-a Democrat. This copy was attached to the bill for the admission of Minnesota into the union. However, when the bill was reported back from the Senate, historians report that the Republican constitution was attached. In any event, there is substantial authority that both constitutions were before Congress when Minnesota was admitted to the union on May 11, 1858. But, in reality the constitution ratified by Congress was not the original constitution. At the election of October 13, 1857, in addition to voting on the constitution, the voters elected executive, legislative and judicial officers. The state officers were content to wait for the act of Congress before assuming office. But the legislature took a contrary view. It convened on December 3, 1857, on the theory that under the Enabling Act the statehood of Minnesota began when the voters approved the constitution. Even though this theory was incorrect, the legislature proceeded to enact laws, the effect of which have remained undisturbed by the courts. The first two acts passed by the legislature were proposed amendments to the constitution. One amendment authorized a loan to railroads of $5,000,000, and the other related to the term of office of the first state officers. These amendments were ratified by the voters at a special election held April 15, 1858. Thus, it would appear that the constitution which Congress approved on May 11,1858, was an amended constitution-not the original adopted by the constitutional convention and approved by the voters in 1857. The Minnesota Constitution -1974 Publication of the Minnesota Constitution in the following form reflects an amendment approved by the legislature and submitted to the voters according to Article IX (see p. _, this manual). The legislature in 1971 established a constitutional study commission to review the constitution and make recommendations to maintain its utility. On November 5, 1974, voters approved an amendment which was recommended by the commission after two years study. Alter two years study, the commission recommended that an amendment restructuring the constitution for easy reference and rewriting it in modern language be prepared. The amendment was introduced and passed in both houses, signed by the governor, and approved by the voters on November 5, 1974. Subsequent amendments which may be voted by Minnesota citizens will be made to this document. The previous wording of the constitution is printed, with all the amendments approved by voters since its adoption in 1857, in the 1974-1975 Legislative Manual, pp. 445-484. The amendment approved in 1974 did not alter the meaning of the constitution. In cases of constitutional law, the original document remains the final authority. The report of the constitutional study commission is available in public libraries and in the Legislative Reference Library (see p. 223, this manual).

Lands so acquired shall be subject to the trust, if any, to which the lands exchanged therefor were subject. The state shall reserve all mineral and water power rights in lands transferred by the state. Sec. 11. School and other public lands of the state better adapted for the production of timber than for agriculture may be set apart as state school forests, or other state forests as the legislature may provide. The legislature may also provide for their management on forestry principles. The net revenue therefrom shall be used for the purposes for which the lands were granted to the state. Sec. 12. The legislature shall not authorize any county, township or municipal corporation to become indebted to aid in the construction or equipment of railroads to any amount that exceeds five per cent of the value of the taxable property within that county, township or municipal corporation. The amount of taxable property shall be determined by the last assessment previous to the incurring of the indebtedness. Sec. 13. All officers and other persons charged with the safekeeping of state funds shall be required to give ample security for funds received by them and to keep an accurate entry of each sum received and of each payment and transfer. If any person converts to his own use in any manner or form, or shall loan, with or without interest, or shall deposit in his own name, or otherwise than in the name of the state of Minnesota; or shall deposit in banks or with any person or persons or exchange for other funds or porperty, any portion of the funds of the state or the school funds aforesaid, except in the manner prescribed by law, every such act shall be and constitute an embezzlement of so much of the aforesaid state and school funds, or either of the same, as shall thus be taken, or loaned, or deposited or exchanged, and shall be a felony. Any failure to pay over, produce or account for the state school funds, or any part of the same entrusted to such officer or persons as by law required on demand, shall be held and be taken to be prima facie evidence of such embezzlement. ARTICLE XII SPECIAL LEGISLATION; LOCAL GOVERNMENT Section 1. In all cases when a general law can be made applicable, a special law shall not be enacted except as provided in section 2. Whether a general law could have been made applicable in any case shall be judicially determined without regard to any legislative assertion on that subject. The legislature shall pass no local or special law authorizing the laying out, opening, altering, vacating or maintaining of roads, highways, streets or alleys; remitting fines, penalties or forfeitures; changing the names of persons, places, lakes or rivers; authorizing the adoption or legitimation of children; changing the law of descent or succession; conferring rights on minors; declaring any named person of age; giving effect to informal or invalid wills or deeds, or affecting the estates of minors or persons under disability; granting divorces; exempting property from taxation or regulating the rate of interest on money; creating private corporations, or amending, renewing, or extending the charters thereof; granting toany private corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise whatever or authorizing public taxation for a private purpose.

Every law which upon its effective date applies to a single local government unit or to a group of such units in a single county or a number of contiguous counties is a special law and shall name the unit or, in the latter case, the counties to which it applies. The legislature may enact special laws relating to local government units, but a special law, unless otherwise provided by general law, shall become effective only after its approval by the affected unit expressed through the voters or the governing body and by such majority as the legislature may direct. Any special law may be modified or superseded by a later home rule charter or amendment applicable to the same local government unit, but this does not prevent the adoption of subsequent laws on the same subject. The legislature may repeal any existing special or local law, but shall not amend, extend or modify any of the same except as provided in this section. Sec. 3. The legislature may provide by law for the creation, organization, administration, consolidation, division and dissolution of local government units and their functions, for the 55 56 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE change of boundaries thereof, for theirelective and appointive officers including qualifica\u00ad tions for office and for the transfer of county seats. A county boundary may not be changed or county seat transferred until approved in each county affected by a majority of the voters voting on the question. Sec. 4. Any local government unit when authorized by law may adopt a home rule charter for its government. A charter shall become effective if approved by such majority of the voters of the local government unit as the legislature prescribes by general law. If a charter provides for the consolidation or separation of a city and a county, in whole or in part, it shall not be effective without approval of the voters both in the city and in the remainder of the county by the majority required by law. Sec. 5. The legislature shall provide by law for charter commissions. Notwithstanding any other constitutional limitations the legislature may require that commission members be freeholders, provide for their appointment by judges of the district court, and permit any member to hold any other elective or appointive office other than judicial. Home rule charter amendments may be proposed by a charter commission or by a petition of five percent of the voters of the local government unit as determined by law and shall not become effective until approved by the voters by the majority required by law. Amend\u00ad ments may be proposed and adopted in any other manner provided by law. A local government unit may repeal its home rule charter and adopt a statutory form of government or a new charter upon the same majority vote as is required by law for the adoption of a charter in the first instance. ARTICLE XIII MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS Section 1. The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it is the duty of the legislature to establish a general and uniform system of public schools. The legislature shall make such provisions by taxation or otherwise as will secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools throughout the state. Sec. 2. I n no case shall any public money or property be appropriated or used for the support of schools wherein the distinctive doctrines, creeds or tenents of any particular Christian or other religious sect are promulgated or taught.

The duration of the Vietnam conflict may be defined by law. Sec. 9. The legislature shall pass laws necessary for the organization, discipline and service of the militia of the state. Sec. 10.

Sec. 2. There is hereby created a trunk highway system which shall be constructed, improved and maintained as public highways by the state. The highways shall extend as nearly as possible along the routes number 1 through 70 described in the constitutional amendment adopted November 2, 1920, and the routes described in any act of the legislature which has made or hereafter makes a route a part of the trunk highway system. The legislature may add by law new routes to the trunk highway system. The trunk highway system may not exceed 12,200 miles in extent, except the legislature may add trunk highways in excess of the mileage limitation as necessary orexpedient to take advantage of any federal aid made available by the United States to the state of Minnesota. Any route added by the legislature to the trunk highway system may be relocated or removed from the system as provided by law. The definite location of trunk highways numbered 1 through 70 may be relocated as provided by law but no relocation shall cause a 57 deviation from the starting points or terminals nor cause any deviation from the various villages and cities through which the routes are to pass under the constitutional amendment adopted November 2, 1920. The location of routes may be determined by boards, officers or tribunals in the manner prescribed by law. Sec. 3. A county state-aid highway system shall be constructed, improved and maintained by the counties as public highways in the manner provided by law. The system shall include streets in municipalities of less than 5,000 population where necessary to provide an integrated and coordinated highway system and may include similar streets in larger mu nici pal ities. Sec. 4. A municipal state-aid street system shall be constructed, improved and maintained as public highways by municipalities having a population of 5,000 or more in the manner provided by law. Sec. 5. There is hereby created a highway user tax distribution fund to be used solely for highway purposes as specified in this article. The fund consists of the proceeds of any taxes authorized by sections 9 and 10 of this article. The net proceeds of the taxes shall be apportioned: 62 percent to the trunk highway fund; 29 percent to the county state-aid highway fund; nine percent to the municipal state-aid street fund. Five percent of the net proceeds of the highway user tax distribution fund may be set aside and apportioned by law to one or more of the three foregoing funds. The balance of the highway user tax distribution fund shall be transferred to the trunk highway fund, the county state-aid 58 CHAPTER 1 NORTH STAR STATE highway fund, and the municipal state-aid street fund in accordance with the percentages set forth in this section. No change in the apportionment of the five percent may be made within six years of the last previous change. Sec. 6. There is hereby created a trunk highway fund which shall be used solely for the purposes specified in section 2 of this article and the payment of principal and interest of any bonds issued under the authority of section 11 of this article and any bonds issued for trunk highway purposes prior to July 1,1957. All payments of principal and interest on bonds issued shall be a first charge on money coming into this fund during the year in which the principal or interest is payable. Sec. 7. There is hereby created a county state-aid highway fund. The county state-aid highway fund shall be apportioned among the counties as provided by law. The funds apportioned shall be used by the counties as provided by law for aid in the construction, improvement and maintenance of county state-aid highways. The legislature may authorize the counties by law to use a part of the funds apportioned to them to aid in the construction, improvement and maintenance of other county highways, township roads, municipal streets and any other public highways, including but not limited to trunk highways and municipal state-aid streets within the respective counties. Sec. 8. There is hereby created a municipal state-aid street fund to be apportioned as provided by law among municipalities having a population of 5,000 or more.

Sec. 9. The legislature by law may tax motor vehicles using the public streets and highways on a more onerous basis than other personal property. Any such tax on motor vehicles shall be in lieu of all other taxes thereon, except wheelage taxes imposed by political subdivisions solely for highway purposes. The legislature may impose this tax on motor vehicles of companies paying taxes under the gross earnings system of taxation notwithstanding that earn ings from the vehicles may be i ncl uded in the earni ngs on wh ich gross earni ngs taxes are computed. The proceeds of the tax shall be paid into the highway user tax distribution fund. The law may exempt from taxation any motor vehicle owned by a nonresident of the state properly licensed in another state and transiently or temporarily using the streets a,nd highways of the state. Sec. 70. The legislature may levy an excise tax on any means or substance used for propelling vehicles on the public highways of this state or on the business of selling it.

Bonds issued and unpaid shall not at any time exceed $150,000,000 par value. The proceeds shall be paid into the trunk highway fund. Any bonds shall mature serially over a term not exceeding 20 years, shall not be sold for less than par and accrued interest and shall not bear interest at a greater rate than five percent per annum. If the trunk highway fund is not adequate to pay principal and interest of these bonds when due, the legislature may levy on all taxable property of the state in an amount sufficient to meet the deficiency or it may appropriate to the fund money in the state treasury not otherwise appropriated. Congressional Act of Admission Acceptance by Congress is the final act in the process of being admitted as a state. A bill for the admission of Minnesota into the Union was submitted to Congress in December of 1857. The bill for admission encountered several obstacles. The Minnesota bill was coupled with the bill for the admission of Kansas. It was customary to admit states in pairs-a state which permitted slavery would be linked with a state which prohibited slavery. This served to preserve the balance of power in Congress. Minnesota was to be a free state, Kansas a slave state. The proposal to admit Kansas as a slave state was being made under its fraudulent Lecompton constitution. The fraud in the adoption of the Kansas constitution was so glaring that admission under it was abandoned. This delayed the Minnesota bill for several months. Minnesota's bill also met with general opposition from congressmen from southern slave states. On May 11, 1858, the bill for the admission of Minnesota was passed by Congress and approved by President James Buchanan. However, word of its passsage did not reach St. Paul until almost two weeks later. Minnesota had no telegraph lines or railroads, so a telegram was sent to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and carried up the Mississippi River to St. Paul by steamboat. On May 24, 1858, the state officers took their oaths of office and Minnesota's state government began to function. This ended the long trek toward statehood, which had seen the area of the state of Minnesota under four nations-France, Spain, Great Britain and the United States, and under nine territories-Northwest, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota. ACT OF ADMISSION INTO THE UNION An Act for the Admission of Minnesota into the Union [Passed May 11, 1858] WHEREAS. An act of Congress was passed February twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven. entitled \"An Act to authorize the people of the Territory of Minnesota to form a constitution and state government preparatory to their admission into the Union on an equal footing with the original states\"; and, whereas, the peo\u00ad ple of said Territory did, on the twenty-ninth day of August, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, by delegates elected for that purpose, form for themselves a constitu\u00ad tion and state government. which is republican in form. and was ratified and adopted by the people at an election held on the thirteenth day of October. eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, for that purpose; therefore. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa\u00ad tives of the United States of America. in Congress as\u00ad sembled, That the State of Minnesota shall be one. and is hereby declared to be one, of the United States of America. and admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever. SEC. 2. And be it further enacted. That said State shall be entitled to two representatives in Congress. until the next apportionment of representatives among the several states. SEC. 3.

Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.

No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen. The vice president of the United States shall be president of the senate, but shall have no vote unless they be equally divided. The senate shall choose their own officers, and also a president pro tempore, in the absence of the vice presi\u00ad dent, or when he shall exercise the office of president of the United States. 'Amendments ratified 1913. See Amendment No. 17. The senate shall have the sale power to try all impeach\u00ad ments. When sitting for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation.

SEC. 7. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives, but the senate may propose Or concur with amendments, as on other bills.

If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be recon-sidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been pre\u00ad sented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjourn\u00ad ment prevent its return; in which case it shall not be a law.

LEGISLATIVE BRANCH A total of 120 days may be used for each biennium (two year session) as 201 legislators examine public policy and the laws which establish a measure of the quality of life in the North Star State. Citizens par\u00ad ticipate in discussions during the session and in the interim months of recess between years as each house maintains an active calendar of hearings and meet\u00ad ings. 68 CHAPTER 2 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE Senate Office 231 State Capitol St. Paul 55155 (612) 296-2343 House Information 8 State Capitol St. Paul 55155 (612) 296-2146 Constitution provides: to be elected a member of the State Senate or House of Representatives, a person must be a qualified voter, 21 years old, a resident of Minnesota for one year, and a resident of the legislative district for six months immediately preceding the election. (Article IV) Terms: State Senator - 4 years; State Representative - 2 years Compensation: $8400 annually; round trips between home and state capital; per diem allowance for living expenses during sessions. Membership and apportionment: In an attempt to meet their responsibility to reapportion the Legislature after the 1970 federal census, the members passed a reapportionment plan on October 29, 1971, and adjourned Sine Die on October 30. The governor vetoed the bill on November 1, 1971. On December 3, 1971, a three judge federal panel submitted a plan which reduced the size of the legislature to 35 senators and 105 representatives. The Minnesota Senate filed an appeal of the U. S. District Court decision on January 25,1972. The appeal was upheld on the grounds that the three judge panel had no right to reduce the size of the legislature. The U. S. Supreme Court then ordered the three judge panel to produce a new plan which would not reduce the size. This plan was adopted June 2, 1972 and reapportioned the legislature into its present membership: 67 senators and 134 representatives. Organization: Members of the House of Representatives were nominated and elected with party designation in 1974, ending 60 years of nonpartisan tradition. State Senators affiliated with either the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) or the Independent-Republican (IRC) caucuses. DFL caucus organized both houses of the legislature during the 1975 session. Their margin was 38 to 28 (with one Independent) in the Senate; 103 to 31 in the House of Representatives. Presiding officers: The Senate elects its President from among its ranks. The President presides over the Senate and shares with the Speaker the chairmanship of the Legislative Coordinating Commission. The Speaker of the House is both a voting member of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer. The Speaker also presides over joint sessions of the House and Senate. Senators in 1975 nominated Senator Alec G. Olson (DFL) and Senator Lew Larson (IRC) for President of the Senate. Senator Olson was elected. In 1975 Representative Martin Olav Sabo (DFL) was nominated for Speaker of the House and elected unanimously. Each house elects staff members. The Secretary of the Senate, Patrick E. Flahaven, and the Chief Clerk of the House, Edward A. Burdick, are the highest ranking staff officers in each body. 69 70 CHAPTER 2 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH FuncHons and powers: The principal legal task of the legislature is to make law by which public policy is established. Legislative activity affects a wide range of state programs and resources including agriculture, conservation, crime prevention, contracts, education, economic development, consumer protection, elections, environment, finance, forestry, health, highways, human rights, insurance, labor relations, natural resources, property, pollution control, recreation, safety, taxation, transportation, utilities, unemployment compensation, veteran's affairs, workmen's compensation and many other matters that may necessitate state action. Additionall,egislative functions include proposing amendments to the state constitution for approval by the electorate, electing regents of the University of Minnesota, confirming certain gubernatorial appointments (Senate), and performing legislative oversight or review. The legislature also possesses a judicial function. It judges the election and qualifications of its members, may punish or expell members for contempt or disorderly behavior, and may impeach or remove from office members of the executive and judicial branches. Regular sessions: The Minnesota legislature convenes in regular session each odd-numbered year on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. The 1972 flexible session amendment to Article IV of the Constitution authorized the legislature to meet in regular session in both years of the biennium, for a total of 120 legislative days, providing that the legislature cannot me~t_ after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May of any year. . The temporary adjournment between the session of the first year and the second year of the biennium is not a final adjournment, as the biennial session is considered as one continuous session. For this reason, the journals of both houses are paged consecutively through both years and bills are numbered consecutively in order of introduction through both years. Three test cases were brought in District Court for declaratory judgments to determine whether three bills passed in 1973 were valid enactments of law by the legislature. The District Court ruled and the Supreme Court affirmed, the 1973 Minnesota legislative session and the 1974 session are technically one session separated by a temporary adjournment. Billswhich have not become law or been defeated by legislative action or vetoed by the end of the first half of the session are still available for possible action in the second half of the session. This means standing committees may hear such bills in the interim recess and make recommendations on their passage. Extra Sessions The legislature may be called into extra session at any time by the governor. Extra sessions become necessary when legislative action is needed to meet emergencies or when legislative work is unfinished at the end of a regular session. The governor is the only official empowered to call an extra session. The governor does not have the power to limit the length or scope of the session. Committees: The Speaker appoints members of the House to committees and names committee chairmen. Nominated by the majority caucus, the Speaker works closely with the House majority and becomes a leading spokesman for caucus policies. In the Senate, the chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, normally the leader of the majority group, has similar power. The Senate Committee on Committees names the committee members and chairmen. Minneapolis Star Photo Convening the legislature Both houses of the legislature open their regular sessions at noon. The lieutenant governor, having already taken the oath of office, calls the Senate to order. The House of Representatives is called to order by the Secretary of State who presides over that body as its convening authority until a Speaker is elected and has taken the oath of office. After convening, the oath of office is administered to all members of each house. 72 CHAPTER 2 LEGISLATIVE BRANCH The committee system is a vital component of the legislative machinery. The volume of legislation pending before a single session is too great to permit all legislators to work closely with all proposals. It is at the committee level where the public can testify for or against a bi II. Both proponents and opponents of proposed legislation are heard before committees make their recommen\u00ad dation to the full legislature. The fate of any legislative proposal may be decided by a committee. After study, hearings, research and deliberation, a bill may be amended, recommended for passage, re-referred to another committee, or it may be tabled. The number of committees in each house and the number of members serving on each committee varies from session to session as state concerns and problems dictate. During the 1975 session the Senate had 13 standing committees and the House 17. In addition to the standing committees which operate during each session, some commit\u00ad tees continue to study specific problems during the legislative interim to report findings to the next legislative session. Each legislative body has a Rules Committee whose decisions direct the operating procedures of the legislature. The rules adopted in 1975 by the two houses, their joint rules, Minnesota Statutes, and the state constitution provide the guidelines under which legislative business is conducted. (see p. 227 to 244 this manual) \"The style of all laws of this state shall be: 'Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Minnesota.''' How are laws passed? -Minnesota Constitution, Article IV, Section 22 All revenue (tax measures) must originate in the House. All other matters may originate in either the House or the Senate. How long does it take to pass a bill? There is no stated time schedule; speed is often related directly to the legislative support a proposal gathers. In 1971, the legislature ratified the 26th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution lowering the voting age to 18 in a time shorter than one committee hearing on a more controversial matter . . The Campaign Finance Reform legislation required all of the 1973 and 1974 halves of the session for its hearings, debates, and final passage. What is the public's role in passing laws? Committee meetings are open to the public, and anyone wishing to speak for or against proposals being considered is given a chance to be heard. Where can the public get copies of bills? The House and Senate Index offices in the capitol keep a file of bills by number, and anyone may visit these offices to request and receive a copy of a bill without charge. More questions about how bills become laws? On pages 210 and 211 of this man ual there is a step-by-step explanation of the proceedings from bill to law.

Elected: 1972; re-elected 1974. 209 210 CHAPTER 2 LEGISLATIVE A Bill for an Act. ... . . . is an idea for a new law or an idea to change or abolish an existing law. Ideas follow ten steps on their way to become Minnesota laws: 1. The idea Anyone can propose an idea for a bill -an individual, a consumer group, corporation, professional association, a governmental unit, the governor -but most fre\u00ad quently ideas come from mem\u00ad bers of the legislature. 2. The chief author Each bill must have a legislator to introduce it in the legislature as chief author. The chief author's name appears on the bill with the bill's file number as identification while it moves through the legis\u00ad lative process. 3. Other authors The chief author of a bill, under legisla\u00ad tive rules, may select other authors, but no more than a total of five in the house and three in the Senate. These authors' names also appear on the bill. 5. Introduction 4. The revisor of statutes The revisor puts the idea into the proper legal form as a bill for introduction into the House of Representatives or the Senate, usually both. The revisor also updates Minnesota Statutes to include all new laws. When introduced in the House of Representatives, a bill receives a House File number (H. F. 2312, for example); in the Senate, a Senate File number (S. F. 503, for example). These numbers indicate the bill's chronological order of introduction in each body. 6. Committee consideration Next the bill has its first reading (the Minnesota constitution requires three readings for all bills -on three separate days), and the presiding officer of the House or Senate refers it to an appropriate standing committee. All committee meetings are open to the public. A committee may, -recommend passage of a bill in its original form. -recommend passage after amendment by the committee. -make no recommendation, in which case a bill may die when the session ends. After acting on a bill, the committee sends a report to the House or Senate, stating its actions and recommendations. 7. General Orders After adoption of the committee report in the House and Senate, the bill has its second reading and goes onto General Orders of the Day. In Committee of the Whole legislators discuss bi 115 on General Orders; they may debate the issues, adopt amendments, present arguments on the bills, and they may vote to recommend: -that a bill \"do pass\" -postponement -further committee action 8. The calendar The calendar is a list of bills the Committee of the Whole recommends to pass. At this pOint - a bill has its third reading. -amendments to the bill must have the unanimous consent of the entire body. -legislators vote on it for the final time. By committee recommendation, bills of a non-controversial nature can by-pass General Orders and go directly onto a \"consent calendar,\" usually passing without debate. Every bill requires a majority vote of the full membership of the House and Senate to pass. 9. Conference committee When the House and the Senate both pass the same version of a bill, that bill goes to the governor for his approval or disapproval. If the House and Senate do not agree, a conference committee, made up of three to five senators, and an equal number of represen\u00ad tatives, meets to reach an agree\u00ad ment. If both bodies then pass the bill in compromise form, it goes to the governor. 10. The governor When a bill arrives, the governor may: sign it and the bill becomes law. veto it (return it with a \"veto message\" stating objections) to the body where it originated. pocket veto the bill (after final adjournment of the legislature) exercise the right to line veto portions of appropriations bills If the governor does not sign or veto a bill within three days after receiving it, while the legislature is in session, the bill becomes a law.

Berg R. Stumpf Merriam Willet Olhoft At some time during most days, each house resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole to con- sider bills reported to the house by standing committees. While sitting as the Committee of the Whole legislators are given an opportunity to become more fami 1- iar with various proposals and to take preliminary action before the measure comes before the body for final passage.

If such report is adopted, the bill will be printed and placed on the Calendar of Ordinary Matters after its second reading.

A motion to postpone to a day certain, to commit, to postpone indefinitely, or to amend, having been decided, shall not again be put on the same day, nor at the same stage of the bill or proposition. MOTION TO ADJOURN 16. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, and also a motion to adjourn to a time certain. The latter motion is debatable.

Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota, BA in Social Studies Education and Psychology (1974). loined staff of the Lieutenant Governor's office in August, 1974. Married to Paul V. Olson. Functions and Services The lieutenant governor is first in line when a vacancy occurs in the office of governor. In case the governor is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the same devolves on the lieutenant governor. When a vacancy occurs in the office of lieutenant governor, the last elected presiding officer of the senate becomes the lieutenant governor. In order to make the office of lieutenant governor more meaningful and productive, a bill was enacted in 1971 enabling the governor to delegate to the lieutenant governor such powers, duties, responsibilities, and functions as are prescribed by law to be performed by the governor, subject to his control, by filing a written order specifying such delegation with the secretary of state; provided, however, that no power, duty, responsibility, or function imposed upon the governor by the constitution shall be delegated by such written order or otherwise. Formerly, the lieutenant governor presided over the Minnesota state senate. A constitu\u00ad tional amendment ratified in November, 1972, permitted the senate to choose its own presiding officer. Consequently the duties of the lieutenant governor were changed and he became a full time official of the executive branch. 255 CHAPTER 3 CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS The duties and responsibilities of the lieutenant Governor are as follows: 1. Chairman of the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Commission. 2. Member of the Executive Council. 3. Ex-officio member of the State Arts Council. 4.

Appointment by the gover\u00ad nor designates the commissioner of the 21 depart\u00ad ments of the executive branch and the composition of a variety of almost a hundred boards, committees, councils, and authorities. Although some executive agencies are independent in matters of organization, all are aware of the link between the legislative and executive branches as they fulfill their constitutional or statutory functions. 280 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES Article V of the Minnesota Constitution ( p 43 to 58 ,this manual) defines in broad outline the dimensions of the executive branch. Subsequent action by the legislature over 117 years has supplied details about administration and finances. Each biennium the legislature reviews budget requests as departments and agencies identify their goals and services. As part of this process of study and evaluation, in 1975 three statutes were enacted which establish standard nomenclature for state agencies and set terms and time of appointment for members of professional licensing boards and advisory councils and committees. Nomenclature: Chapter 271, 1975 laws, provides for the following name designation (nomenclature) by type: \"board\" -agency in executive branch other than a department whose primary purpose is to perform prescribed official or representative functions and which must have at least one of the following powers: \u00b7 . to perform administrative acts (may include expending funds) . to issue and revoke licenses or certifications \u00b7 . to make rules \u00b7 . to adjudicate contested cases and appeals \"committee\" -agency in executive branch whose primary purpose is to advise state officers, departments, boards or other agencies. \"council\" - a committee of which at least half the members are required to be certain officers or representatives of specific businesses, occupations, industries, political subdivisions, organizations, or other groupings of persons of other than geographical regions. \"authority\" -agency in executive branch other than a department whose primary purpose is to issue bonds for financing, ownership and development of facilities within the state. Chapter 271 also changed the names of existing agencies to comply with these designations and provided that although the act became effective July 1, 1975, agencies whose names have been changed have until the first Monday in January, 1978, to effect the change. This manual reflects both the new name and the old name for such agencies in its chapter directory (p 281 to 285) and index (p 605). Professional Licensing Boards*: Chapter 136, 1975 laws, states the time of appointment for members of the professional licensing boards. Terms are for four years: the governor appoints as nearly as possible one-fourth of the members to terms expiring each year on January 1. If between January 1 and July 1 no successor is named, the incumbent remains for another four year term. State Advisory Councils and Committees*: Chapter 315, 1975 laws, sets these terms at four years beginning January 1. Terms of one-half the members are to be conterminous with the governor and the remaining one-half end on the first Monday in January one year after the terms of the other members. If successors are not appointed by July 1, the incumbent continues for another four year term. *Both acts provide for a change-over period to accommoddte current term\" of present member~ Directory of State Departments and Agencies included in this chapter (*-name changed, see p. 280) Department!

The purpose of the system is to attract and retain employees and to provide income for covered employees or their beneficiaries upon retirement, disability or death. Benefit provisions for the various plans administered differ but are generally in proportion to length of service and covered salary. The plans administered by the System are contributory plans-that is, the employee as well as the employer contribute, usually as a percentage of their salary, to provide the financing of the benefits. The contribution rates differ from plan to plan depending on the type and level of benefits provided. The monies contributed are invested in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 11. Actuarial surveys and studies are performed as provided in Chapter 356. State employees and newly appointed judges are covered by social security to wh ich the employee and employer also contribute. Legislators, constitutional officers, members of the highway patrolmen's fund and some of the judges are not covered by social security.

Indefinite Indefinite Indefinite Functions: Established in 1931, the Public Employees Retirement Association provides annuity protection to public employees throughout the state including persons employed by counties, cities, townships, and school districts. As of June 30, 1974 the membership totaled 80,256 with 11,835 former members, or their beneficiaries, receiving annuities; disability or survivor benefits. Minimum retirement age is 58 with at least 20 years of allowable service, but benefits at age earlier than 65 are reduced by one-half of one percent for each month under 65, except that a member with 30 years of allowable service may retire as early as age 62 with no reduction in annuity. Annuity is based on the highest five successive years' average salary. A member may select a 50% or 100% joint and survivor annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of a normal (personal) annuity. Annuity formula, based on average salary, appears below: Coordinated (with social security) Basic (without social security) 1st 10 years-1 % per year of service 1st 10 years-2 % per year of service Thereafter -111,% per year of service Thereafter -2%% per year of service If a member dies after at least 18 months of credit, provision is made for survivor benefits. Dependent spouse is entitled to 30% of decedent's average salary over six months preceding death; each dependent child under age 18 or between 18 and 22 if a fulltime student, is entitled to 10% of said average salary. Maximum family benefit is $450 monthly. Only survivors of basic members (without social security) are eligible for these benefits. If no survivor benefits are due, the beneficiary named by the decedent (or if none, the estate) receives a refund of salary deductions with interest at 3'1,% compounded annually. Total and permanent disability benefits are available to members under age 65. If less than 50 years old member must have at least 10 years of allowable service, or after age 50 not less than five years of such service are required. Benefit is equal to the normal annuity without reduction because of age. There is also a supplemental benefit of $5 for each year under age 65, not to exceed $50 monthly, which supplement applies only to basic members. If qualified, a disabilitant may collect disability benefits from both PERA and social security. Basic members pay 8% of total salary, and employers pay 8% matching plus 2'1,%. Coordinated members pay 4% of total salary, and employers pay 4% matching plus 1'1,%, plus required social security taxes.

Qualifications for the office of adjutant general (appointed by the governor): must be a commissioned officer of the Minnesota National Guard with at least ten years of service in the armed forces of the state or United States, have been commissioned for at least three of the ten years, and have reached the grade of a field officer. (Minnesota Statutes 190.07) Adjutant General: Brigadier General James G. Sieben Staff: Biography: Born April 19, 1924, Hastings, Minnesota. Enlisted as a private in the u.s. Army during World War, II and was awarded the Silver Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. Joined the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1948 and was called to Active Duty during the Korean Conflict. Attended Uni\u00ad versity of Minnesota four years and Stanford University one year.

Deputy Adjutant General-Assistant Adjutant General, William H. Cheeseman Assistant Adjutant General, Air, Leo C. Goodrich Administrative Assistant, Clinton G. Johnson Operations and Training, Jack D. Hunt Comptroller, Thomas J. Ryan Adjutant, David S. )\\'\\ichaud Technician Personnel Officer, Clayton P. Felix Military Support to (ivil Authorities, George M. Fuller Air Administrative, Joseph A. Kazek Function: The Adjutant General is the head of the Department of Military Affairs and is appointed by the Governor for an indefinite term. Other department officials are appointed by the Adjutant General for indefinite terms and are placed on state military duty. Each official of the department receives the same pay and allowances of his grade as is authorized officers of similar rank and length of service in the Regular Army of the United States. The Adjutant General is charged with the recruitment, organization, administration, training, discipline, and supply of the military force of the state, designated as the Minnesota National Guard, which is equipped and, to a very large extent, maintained by the federal government. Th is force has a dual status in that it is the Minnesota National Guard when in the service of the state and the National Guard of the United States when it is ordered into active military service. When the Guard is in active federal service and the security and welfare of the state is endangered because of the absence from the state of this military force, the Military Code of Minnesota prescribes that the military force of the state will consist of the Minnesota State Guard, organized from those of the Militia of the state who are not likely to be called to federal service during the war or emergency. The Adjutant General, on appointment by the Executive Council, is the Disaster Relief Coordinator and is responsible for coordinating the use of state agencies and of state and federal emergency funds allocated by the Executive Councilor by the federal government. The Minnesota National Guard has served in active federal service in all of our nation's wars, beginning with the Civil War through and to include the Korean Incident. In October 1961 the 133rd Military Airlift Wing and its subordinate units of the Minnesota Air National Guard were ordered into federal service, for one year, in connection with the Berlin Crises. During the Viet Nam Conflict it has been the policy of the United States Department of Defense to utilize the 47th Infantry Division of the Minnesota Army National Guard as a special Reserve Force with a specific mission, and the Minnesota Air National Guard as part of the Air Force Team with the 133rd Military Airlift Wing flying cargo and troops worldwide with monthly trips to Viet Nam, and the 148th Fighter Interceptor Group at Duluth flying interceptor missions on a 24 hou r a day basi s. 365 days a year, as an intricate part of the Air Defense of the United States. During the period while the Minnesota National Guard was on active duty for World War II and the Korean War, the department organized and maintained a Minnesota State Guard. Whereas the National Guard is armed, uniformed, equipped, and paid for armory drill and field training by the federal government, the State Guard receives no pay while in service in the state by the federal government, and the state must pay for supplyirig arms and equipment for this force. Plans have been prepared for reactivation of the State Guard should a national emergency again require federal mobilization of our National Guard units. At the present time the Minnesota National Guard has an authorized strength of 11,945 officers and men. Approximately 9,900 are assigned to the 47th Infantry Division and non divisional troops of the Army National Guard, and the remainder are assigned to the 133rd Tactical Airlift Wing, Minneapolis, and the 148th Fighter Interceptor Group, Duluth. Army National Guard units are stationed in 66 state-owned armories situated throughout the state and at an Army Aviation base at the Saint Paul Downtown Airport. Air National Guard units are located at a state-owned base at Duluth International Airport, Duluth, and at a federally owned airbase under license to the state at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Minneapolis. The Military Department also has control over Camp Ripley Military Reservation, located seven miles north of Little Falls, Minnesota. Owned by the State of Minnesota, the camp has more than 53,000 acres of ranges and training areas and can provide housing and training facilities for up to 10,000 troops at one time. National Guardsmen from seven states, conduct summer training there each year. In addition, certain Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois units conduct cold-weather training there during winter months and weekend training on a year-round basis. Although the land was purchased and is owned by the state, most of the buildings have been constructed from federal funds and most of the funds for support of the camp come from federal sources. Armory Building Commission Veterans Service Building St. Paul, Minnesota 55155 (612) 296-4666 law provides: The Minnesota state armory building commission is a public corporation established to acquire, equip and maintain state armories.

Bureaus within Department of Welfare: BUREAU OF COUNTY WELFARE Minnesota's welfare program is state-supervised and locally-administered. The Bureau of County Welfare is primarily responsible for maintaining effective state-county relationships and for program development, coordination, monitoring and evaluation of those programs administered by county welfare departments. The Social Services Division is responsible for planning and program supervision of child welfare and other social services authorized by Minnesota statute and tr.e federal Social Security Act. The Income Maintenance Division carries responsibility for financial aid programs, namely, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, Medical Assistance, General Assistance, General Assistance-Medical, Minnesota Supplemental Aid (to the Federal program of Supplemental Security Income), Emergency Assistance, Food Stamps and Refugee Programs. The Field Services Division serves as a main artery of communication between the state department and local welfare agencies. Each regional representative is responsible for 329 330 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ensuring that county welfare agencies in a given region are administering welfare programs and services in conformity with state and Federal laws and Department of Public Welfare policy. Regional representatives also provide a link between the state department and the respective area mental health ooards and state hospitals located in their assigned counties. The qual ity control review function of the Aid to Fami lies With Dependent Children and the Food Stamp programs also is located in the Field Services Division. A review of a random sample of cases for these programs is required by the federal government to ascertain the eligibility of clients and the correctness of their grants. The Minnesota merit System serves as the central personnel agency for county welfare departments and for county civil defense and public health nursing operations. BUREAU OF COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS The Bureau of Comprehensive Programs is responsible for program development, coordina\u00ad tion, and evaluation in the Department of Public Welfare. It is organized into Program Offices, which represent the major areas of responsibility in the department: families and children, low income, aging, physically handicapped, mental retardation/developmental disabilities, chemical dependency and mental health/behavioral disabilities. The Bureau maintains a Consumer Concerns Office with responsibilities for providing for adequate\u00b7 responsiveness to the needs of individual consumers in the total operation of the department. In addition to these general program responsibilities, the Bureau is responsible for administration of all program grant-in-aid funds delivered through this department, for administration of all departmental licensing activity, for the long-range planning, coordina\u00ad tion, and development of regional human service programs, for the integration, coopera\u00ad tion, and coordination of these and other human services programs operated or funded by other departments of state government or by the priyate sector. BUREAU OF RESIDENTIAL SERVICES The Bureau of Residential Services has administrative responsibility for the overall manage\u00ad ment and direction of care, treatment programs, and services offered in the state hospitals, geriatric facilities, and residential schools under the jurisdiction of the department. The Bureau also has administrative responsibility for management, direction, and coordina\u00ad tion of other direct services, including identification, provision of care and services, vocational placement and education of handicapped children and adults. The direct service programs other than those in residential facilities are Services for the Blind and Services for the Deaf. BUREAU OF SUPPORT SERVICES The Bureau of Support Services' functions include: research and statistics; auditing and cost analysis for nursing homes and facilities caring for the retarded; internal financial and operational audits; office management services; managing the department's state-wide information system; centralized disbursement system for medical assistance payments; and the supervision of collections for cost-of-care services to clients in state hospitals, which comprises financial investigations, determination of responsible payee, and the handling of del inquent accounts. Department of Welfare Programs: STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAMS Most of the state hospitals have expanded their programs to offer a variety of services, including units for mentally retarded individuals at several of the facilities which tradition\u00ad ally have served persons with psychiatric disorders. Similarly, several hospitals now have programs for alcoholic and other chemically dependent persons. The expansion of programs and services is part of the development of the state hospitals as regional, multi-purpose facilities serving the psychiatric, mentally retarded, and chemically addicted disability groups. PROGRAMS FOR MENTALLY ILL Treatment emphasis in programs for mentally ill persons is the rehabilitation of the patient and his return to the community in the shortest feasible period of time. With advancements in treatment methods, and individualized care and rehabilitative programs, the length of hospitalization periods has been dramatically reduced. For the patient who, because of advanced age or severity of illness, cannot readily be returned to his home community or placed in a nursing home, every effort is made to help him lead a useful and productive life within the hospital setting. The hospitals' treatment programs include a variety of educational, social, recreational, occupational, and industrial therapeutic activities which are vital in preparing the patient for his return to the community as an active, useful citizen. During the past decade, the number of mentally ill persons in the Minnesota state hospitals on any given day has declined dramatically; however, the number of persons being admitted for mental illness has risen rapidly. The state hospital system is one part of the state program which serves the mentally ill in Minnesota. The 25 area mentally ill-mentally retarded-inebriacy programs and the county welfare departments also have a major responsibility in the Minnesota delivery system which is rated as one of the best in the nation. PROGRAMS FOR MENTALLY RETARDED Programs at facilities for mentally retarded individuals are designed to meet the needs of residents at different age levels and degrees of competence. Those for children and adolescents include care and physical rehabilitation, activation, social skills training, education, and pre-vo<:atiDnal training. Adult programs provide vocational training and independent living experiences to equip residents with skills toward becoming self-reliant, competent, and productive workers in the community. For those residents who must remain hospitalized, the program is focused on the development of the individual to maximum self-reliance and social responsibility. PROGRAMS FOR CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT The state hospital system has assumed a position of leadership in the delivery of residential services to the alcoholic and abusers of other drugs. Eight multi-disability campuses now have programs that represent a variety of services treating every type of chemical dependency. During the last few years programs have been designed at several of the hospitals to meet the special needs of the communities they serve. These residential services are planned in coordination with county welfare departments, area mental health boards, and other community agencies as an integral and important part of the total \"continuum of care\", outlined in the state plan for alcohol and drugs.

Listed in \"Who's Who in the Midwest\", and \"Who's Who in American Politics.\" Functions: The Department of Natural Resources has the responsibility of conserving and promoting the wise use and management of the state's natural resources-its forests, game and fish, lands, minerals, state parks and waters. During the 1972-74 biennium, The Department of Natural Resources completed action to bring its programs, policies, and services directly to the people. This was accomplished through'decentralization; and particularly-regionalization. Six regions covering the entire state were established and regional administrators appointed (civil service) from department ranks; in accordance with recommendations from the Governor's Loaned Executive Action Program (LEAP). This move away from natural resources management under a divisional (central office) structure places management with six regional administrators, responsible for managing all resources within their assigned region. They are now responsible to the Commissioner and his staff, comprised of the former division directors. As the Commissioner's staff, the division directors now constitute a planning, inspection, project development, guidance and advisory group. The task of the regional administrator is to coordinate natural resource management in his region; to manage natural resources, and direct the efforts of those under his supervision toward accomplishment of department goals. To guide him, he has programs and objectives approved by the Commissioner and formulated with the aid and advice of the commis\u00ad sioner's staff. The legal affairs of the Department of Natural Resources are handled by attorneys assigned to the department's legal bureau by the attorney general. They represent the commissioner in all legal act\u00b7ions and act as legal advisors to the department. The assistant commissioner (administration) directs the functions of seven service units and their activities in the areas of engineering, office services, licensing, systems management, field services, fiscal procedures, and community liaison work. The assistant commissioner (planning and research) coordinates planning activities of six divisions: (fish & wildlife; forestry; minerals; parks and recreation; and waters); and the bureau of environmental planning and protection. This bureau assists in long range planning for the department. The work involves close coordination with the commissioner's office, each division, and other agencies. The objective is to initiate, promote, and integrate planning activities for the DNR in a manner that will further the best conservation of our natural resources. The bureau handles the administration of the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund and the state Natural Resource Program involving grants to assist outdoor recreation projects on both state and county levels. The following are staff bureaus of the commissioner's office: The Bureau of Information and Education is responsible for the planning, production of materials, and dissemination of information regarding Minnesota's natural resources and environment; DNR's policies, programs, techniques and goals in management of these resources; the multitude of diverse recreational opportunities supported by ON R-managed lands and waters; and the aesthetic and economic values inherent in Minnesota's outdoor legacy. The bureau also, through legislative authority, shares responsibility with the Department of Education for development and implementation of formal environmental education curriculum and teacher education programs. The bureau also conducts, through legislative authority, boat and water safety education programs for youths and adults. Publishes the Minnesota Volunteer, official publication of the department (circulation: 78,000 as of July 1, 1975.) Land activities formerly shared by the DNR divisions are now centered in The Bureau of Land. Its responsibilities include: acquisition of land for wildlife, fish management, public access, state parks and state forests; working with all disciplines of the DNR, counties, fe.deral govemment, corporations and private individuals in the matter of land exchange, reviewing exchange proposals to determine whether they are in the best interest of the state, and feasible as well as legally possible. The bureau also is responsible for state land leases to provide a means for the public to utilize state lands for private or commercial purposes when by law or by policy the DNR is restricted in the sale of the land; and for the sale of state lands to provide for the disposal of such state lands that are considered better suited for private development, and are surplus to state needs for conservation purposes. The Bureau's Record Section provides ownership status and other pertinent data to all who request it for each parcel of state-owned, DNR-administered land. The Bureau of Personnel is responsible for administering the personnel affairs of the department; including recruitment, selection, placement, training and maintenance of the work force; and added responsibilities in the area of labor relations and affirmative action, including negotiating and administering of contracts with exclusive bargaining representa\u00ad tives; and adm inistration on a statewide basis of the department's affirmative action plan.

It carries out an extensive program of game census, land acquisition, development for public hunting grounds and wildlife management areas, and a program for improvement of wildlife habitat on private lands. The section manages 963,000 acres of wildlife lands in 861 different wildlife management areas located in 82 counties. It recommends game seasons for 500,000 hunters in the state. The section of fisheries conducts fact finding studies and an extensive fish management program on approximately 2,EDO,000 acres of fishing waters. The program includes fish habitat improvement in lakes and streams, stocking of some 500,000,000 fish of various sizes and species from hatcheries, rearing facilities, rescue and transfer operations,and a rough fish control program that removes about 10,000,000 pounds of rough fish annually. The ta.k of maintaining fishable populations of game fish to satisfy heavy and increasing demands for a large variety of species requires an intensive effort at preservation of fish habitat against detrimental shoreland development through acquisition of critical parcels and close control of activities of shoreline owners. The section of technical services conducts special studies of fish and wildMe resources in areas that will be affected by public and private construction programs, carries out a lake sounding and mapping program, supervises the aquatic nuisance control program, inves\u00ad tigates pollution cases affecting fish and wildlife, and provides laboratory services in biology and chemistry.

All other staff members are appointed through Civil Service processes, with salaries and eligible candidates determined by the department. The commissioner selects appointees from Civil Service lists but actual approval of appointment is given by the Board. Tenure is that regularly provided by the Civil Service laws and rules. The state department is organized into seven major divisions: Administration, Instruction, Planning and Development, Vocational Rehabilitation, Vocational-Technical Education, School Management Services, and Special and Compensatory Education. Purposes and Functions: The Department of Education is the operating agency through which the education\u00ad oriented laws of the legislature and the policies of the State Board of Education are administered. Functions of the department may be classified as follows: Leadership: The department assists local school authorities to meet and improve minimum requirements of state laws through initiative and experimentation. This function is divided further into six smaller categories: planning, research, consultation, coordination, public information and in-service education. Regulation: The department uses its authority to insure the basic needs of the instruction program and to protect the lives and educational health of the state's children. It aims at efficiency in administration, safety, and economy in the use of public school funds, and an educated citizenry. Operation: These functions refer to the department's direct responsibilities for establishing and maintaining classes conducted by field instructors for services to individuals and services provided by the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. STATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM The Minnesota State Constitution requires the Legislature \"to establish a general and uniform system of public schools\" and to \"make such provisions, by taxation or otherwise as, with the income arising from the school fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of public schools in each township in the state.\" The Constitution provides for permanent school funds which are known as the Permanent School Fund, the Swamp Land Fund and the Endowment Fund. Monies accrue to these funds from the sale of school and state lands, from royalties on natural resources that are consumed and from interest on investments. Minnesota Statutes Chapter 120 provides that: \"The State Board of Education shall exercise general supervision over public schools and public educational agencies in the state, classify and standardize public elementary and secondary schools and prepare for them outlines and suggested courses of study. The board shall establish rules relating to examinations, reports, acceptances of schools, courses of study, and other proceedings in connection with elementary and secondary schools applying for special state aid.\" The Legislature has authorized the formation of school districts, which are public corporations with legal responsibilitie, for maintaining educational programs for all eligible resident pupils. Finances -Sources of Support The schools of the state derive support from local, county, state, and federal sources. The state's share approximates 65 per cent of the cost of school maintenance. The following state funds contribute to the support of schools: (1) The Endowment Fund -income from the Permanent School Fund (2) Elementary-Secondary School Occupation Tax Fund -income from 40 per cent of the occupation tax on iron ore. Began July 1,1957. (3) The Special State Aid Fund -an amount appropriated biennially by the Legislature and transferred from the General Fund and the Elementary-Secondary School Occupation Tax Fund. (4) Article XXXIV, Ch. 31, Extra Session Laws of 1971. Reimbursement for tax exempt personal property. State Aids According to a provision in the State Constitution, the Endowment Fund is apportioned to school districts on the basis of school membership. All other state aids are paid from the Special State Aid Fund according to laws enacted by the Legislature. The 1971 Legislature established a formula for paying \"foundation program\" aid. The 1971 Legislature modified the formula and linked it to the permissible school levies\u00b7. The \"foundation program\" aid constitutes the major source of aids for the school districts. Additional aids are granted for the following purposes: Special Classes or other instruction established for pupils handicapped by blindness, deafness, defective speech, mental retardation, emotional disturbance or by being crippled. Emergency Aid to districts unable to maintain schools through high local effort, granted at the discretion of the State Board of Education. Vocational Aid to encourage teaching of vocational courses in the elementary and secondary and area vocational-technical schools. Transportation or board for pupils who reside one mile or more from the public school which they could attend or from the school they attend pursuant to a program approved by the commissioner of education in all districts. Handicapped pupils are also eligible for aid for transportation or board. 385 386 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES School Lunch Aid to assist in the financing of this program in the public schools.

More specifically, its powers include: the power to determine the exact location and site of state junior colleges authorized by the Legislature, and power to appoint the Chancellor, heads of each junior college necessary teachers and supervisors, and all other necessary employees, the power to prescribe the courses of study, conditions of admission, fees and tuition paid by students, graduation requirements and other rules and regulations for the state junior colleges. MINNESOTA COMMUNITY COLLEGES Public junior colleges have existed in Minnesota since 1915. The eleven public junior colleges which were operated by their various school districts until 1964 and their respective dates of origin are as follows; Rochester, and Willmar, 1962. These colleges were supported entirely from local sources until1957 at which time they received $200 per year per full time equivalent student in state aid. The state aid was increased by $50 per student each biennium through 1963 when it reached $350. In 1963 the Legislature passed a law creating the Minnesota State Junior College System under the control of the State Junior College Board. The law provided for the creation of new junior colleges as part of the state system and made it possible for the existing junior colleges to become part of this system. All of these existing junior colleges made the choice to become part of the state system which began in 1964 with ten colleges, Eveleth and Virginia having been combined to form Mesabi State Junior College. New junior colleges which have been started since that time are Anoka-Ramsey in Coon Rapids in 1965, Metropolitan in Minneapolis in 1965, Northland in Thief River Falls in 1965, North Hennepin in Brooklyn Park in 1966, Lakewood in White Bear Lake in 1967, Rainy River in International Falls in 1967, Normandale in Bloomington in 1968, and Inver Hills in Inver Grove Heights in 1970. Extensive building programs have been and are still underway. All of the colleges now occupy their own buildings on their own campuses. Expanding enrollments and growing numbers of programs of studies will require continued expansion of building equipment and campus facilities. The number of students attending colleges in the State Junior College System since the beginning of the state operation in 1964 has increased very substantially. The total enrollment of all public junior colleges in Minnesota during the last year of independent operation, 1963-64, was 3,941 full time equivalent students. Since the state system has been in operation the yearly full time equivalent student enrollments has increased to a projected enrollment in 1974-75 of 17,750. Junior colleges have long served the function of providing the first two years of programs leading to baccalaureate degrees. The Minnesota community colleges are providing this service and are making steady progress toward the national pattern of junior college' operation in providing programs of general studies, vocational and technical programs,' a wide range of offerings in continuing education, and a diverse program of student activities. It is intended that these community colleges shall truly become the post high school educational and cultural centers of the respective areas that function as indicated in the law creating the Minnesota Community College System. Laws of Minnesota 1973, Chapter 349, changed the names of state junior colleges and the state junior college board to community colleges and the board for community colleges. 391 392 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING BOARD* 400 Capitol Square (Financial Aid Div., 901 Capitol Square) 550 Cedar St. St. Paul, MN 55101 (612) 296-3974 law provides: the higher education coordinating board consists of eight citizen members, one from each congressional district, and three citizen members appointed at large.

MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITIES The seven Minnesota State Universities-located in Bemidji, Mankato, Moorhead, SI. Cloud, Southwest at Marshall, Winona and the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-St. Paul\u00ad primarily serve the state of Minnesota by providing quality education at a reasonable cost. Operating under the governance of the ten-member Minnesota State University Board, all have been created by an act of the Legislature and are financed by the tuition and fees paid by the students and by direct appropriation of the legislature. Five of the universities were originally created as normal schools for preparation of elementary school teachers. Winona opened in 1860. Mankato in 1868, St. Cloud in 1869, Moorhead in 1888, and Bemidji in 1919. In the years following World War I the curriculum was expanded and the normal schools became four-year teachers colleges offering the Bachelor of Education degree. The first class to receive this degree was graduated in 1926. During the post World War II period the colleges broadened their curricular objectives to include an increasing number of non-teaching degree programs in the liberal arts and sciences, as well as graduate programs in teacher education. In 1953 the colleges received legislative authorization to offer the Master of Science degree in .Education. In 1957, the Legislature changed the colleges' designation from State Teachers Colleges to State Colleges. Master's degree programs in fields other than education were authorized in 1963. The sixth college, Southwest State College at Marshall, was authorized by the Legislature in 1963 and began instruction in the fall 011967. In 1971, the Legislature established Minnesota Metropolitan State College. Based in the Twin Cities and owning no land or buildings, MMSC is an innovative institution focusing primarily on educational programs for transfer students from community colleges and area 395 396 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES vocational-technical institutes as well as for adults who wish to obtain additional education while continuing to work. In 1975 the legislature changed the state colleges designation to state universities. Today the 32,000 students attending the state universities can choose among many career and professional educational opportunities which reflect the needs of today: -Two-year technical, vocational and pre-professional programs not otherwise available or accessible to students through a community college or vocational school, or which the state colleges are uniquely equipped to offer -Four-year bachelor's degree programs in the liberal arts and sciences, in education, in business, in the fine arts, and in an increasing number of occupational/vocational areas -Graduate programs leading to the master's degree and beyond in selected fields -A common market student exchange program enabling a student enrolled at any state college to take selected courses at any of the other colleges at no loss of credit -Many foreign travel opportunities as well as individualized learning programs which students, with the help of college faculty, can design -Internships for academic credit which allow students to supplement classroom learning with professional experience in jobs related to their major fields. -Special programs to help minorities, women, veterans, working people, the disadvantaged and the physically handicapped realize their educational goals. -At the same time, the six universities beyond the Metro area have been authorized by the state college board to offer external degree programs for persons in the surrounding regions who may not be able to come to the campus to study, or whose educational objectives may require alternatives to the customary on-campus courses. These new programs will not replace the traditional curriculum. Rather, they will provide new options for students and should enrich the more traditional programs through the discovery of new methods of teaching, learning and evaluation. Each of the Minnesota state universities remains committed to using its unique strengths and characteristics to respond to the educational needs of its community and region. The universities also share a commitment to o/fering their students a kind of learning that permits personal development, intellectual growth and a dedication to human values.

It is unique among institutions of its kind in that it is older than the state it serves. 401 402 CHAPTER 4 DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES The objective of the Society is to collect and preserve those items and records which make possible an accurate interpretation of the history of Minnesota through a broad range of dissemination techniques. Its collections comprise one of the largest historical libraries in the Northwest and include 250,000 books, pamphlets, periodicals, and documents, plus over 100,000 cataloged photographs, prints, and paintings. A massive manuscripts collection, emphasizing records of publ ic figures, including those of all of the Minnesotans who served in presidential cabinets and totaling over 24 million items, has recently been greatly enlarged through the acquisition of the records of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railroads. A microfilming program started over twenty years ago makes possible the preservation of the newspapers printed in Minnesota from the first issue of the first newspaper, the Minnesota Pioneer in 1849, to all current issues. Approximately 85 per cent of all newspapers ever printed in Minnesota are on file in either bound volumes or on microfilm. The Society publishes a quarterly magazine, Minnesota Histroy; a magazine for school children, Roots; a bi-monthly newsletter, Minnesota History News; and books on various aspects of the state's history. Recent publications include Ten Men of Minnesota and American Foreign Policy by Barbara Stuhler, A Reference Guide to Minnesota History, a study of Minnesota's State Capitol by Neil B. Thompson, an updated edition of Minnesota's Major Historic Sites: A Guide, a multimedia curriculum unit on The Ojibwe, a booklet on Minnesota's Old Government Roads, and several important studies in preh'lstoric archaeo\u00ad logy. An oral history program gathers primary source material not readily available in printed form through the use of tape recorded interviews. An educational services department provides written and audiovisual resource aids for teachers and students dealing with Minnesota history. By locating, excavating, and interpreting archaeological remains at historic sites throughout the state, the archaeology department brings another dimension to the Society's work. The resources of the Society are available to the public. Museum displays and exhibits, both in the Society's headquarters and at its historic sites, help depict the story of Minnesota from prehistoric times to the present. Thousands of persons visit the Society each year, many of whom are school children to whom museum lessons are given. Tours to places of historic interest are also conducted each summer. County and local historical societies are encouraged and promoted through a field services program. Since 1958the Society has been active in acquiring, preserving, developing, and interpreting major historic sites in Minnesota. Twenty-one important landmarks are now preserved and operated by the Society through gift, purchase by the state, and cooperativ~ agreements. These include significant sites related to agriculture, ancient man, American Indians, the fur trade, politics, transportation, the decorative arts, and mil itary history. The Society serves the public by making it possible for visitors to have direct contact with the past through its historic sites program. The following sites are open on a regular schedule: The Bur\u00ad bank-livingston-Griggs House and the Alexander Ramsey House in SI. Paul, the Oliver H. Kelley Farm near Elk River, the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the southwestern shore of Mille Lacs Lake, the Minnehaha Depot and Historic Fort Snelling in Minneapolis, the W.W. Mayo House in Le Sueur, the Lindbergh House near Little Falls, Connor's Fur Post near Pine City, the Lower Sioux Agency near Morton, the Upper Sioux Agency near Granite Falls, the Indian Petroglyphs near Jeffers, Fort Ridgley near Fairfax, and the Folsom House in Taylors Falls, and the Comstock House in Moorhead. A number of other sites-including the Marine Millsite in Marine on SI. Croix and the Grand Mound near International Falls-have\u00b7been acquired and are in the stage of early development. The Society has a long range program planned for acquisition and development of historic sites of quality in Minnesota to serve its citizens in understanding the present through knowledge of the past. In addition to historic sites, the Society administers a number of programs for the state-the State Archaeology Survey, the State Capitol Tour Program, and the State Archives. The collection of state archives-the public records during the territorial period and since statehood in 1858-are a rich source of history of state government and many other facets of Minnesota history. A network of seven regional centers located on the campuses of cooperating colleges throughout the state expand the research possibilities in the field of Minnesota history by collecting and preserving documentary sources in scattered outstate areas. The operating centers in 1975 were located at Bemidji, Mankato, Marshall, Moorhead, Morris, SI. Cloud, and Winona. Membership in the Society is open to anyone. Members receive the quarterly magazine, the Newsletter, discounts on books, tours, etc. and voting privileges at the annual meeting. Approximately 70 per cent of the Society's funds are received from legislative appropria\u00ad tions. The funds donated from private sources are used primarily to finance special projects. In the disposition of these private funds the Society is deemed a private corporation. MINNESOTA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY '161 Horticulture Science Bldg. University of Minnesota SI.

Buckner Assistant Commissioner, Unemployment Compensation: Barbara Beerhalter Assistant Attorney General: Peter Andrews Function: The unemployment Insurance Division is concerned with the payment of unemployment compensation benefits to eligible persons who become unemployed. Funds to make these payments are accumulated through a tax on the employers. The State Employment Service serves both the worker and the employer through its statewide network of officers. Matching qualified applicants with available jobs continues to be its primary function. As a participant in federal manpower programs, however, the State Employment Service now offers vocational training programs, special services for the mentally and physically handicapped, minority group members, veterans, youth entering the work force, older workers and persons on welfare, and a variety of programs to bring the chronically unemployed into the labor market. The Employment Service also provides employment counseling and testing to jobseekers and technical assistance to employers. In addition, the Department collects statistics relating to the labor market and publishes data on employment trends. STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (advisory to Commissioner, Department of Employment Services) Law provides: That the governor appoint the state advisory council composed in each case of an equal number of employer and employee representatives and as many members as he designates representing the general public.

The 1969 legislature amended the 1939 Act by abolishing the division of conciliation and establishing the bureau of mediation services and transferring the division of conciliation powers thereto. Although the bureau was established in the depart\u00ad ment of labor and industry, it is in no way subject to the control of that department. The bureau is under the direction of the director who is appointed by the governor for a four year term, with the advice and consent of the senate. The director is responsible to the governor only. (Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 179.) Director: Charles A Swanson Deputy: Viola M. Kanatz State Mediators Kenneth Boxell Vern E. Buck Herbert T. Custer Lyle C Horton Viola M. Kanatz William A. LaDue Function: Biography: Fridley. Born July 24, 1926. Appointed January 31,1973, as Director of the Bureau of Mediation Services for a four (4) year term ending March 1,1977. Prior to appointment, acquired background in labor relations through represen\u00ad tation of both management and labor in employer-labor relations matters. Kenneth E. Palmer John V. Pecchia William T. Sampson Warren D. Sandquist Richard R. Springer Kenneth L Tri The purpose of the Minnesota Labor Relations Act and the policies of the Bureau of Mediation Services is the maintenance and promotion of industrial peace within Minnesota. Tempered with this desire for industrial peace is the protection of the rights and interests of the public, employers, representatives of employees, and ihe employees. This basic purpose finds the Bureau attempting to meet two objectives; and the second, the reduction of man days lost due to work stoppage when it occurs. By holding mediation meetings, acting as bargaining agent hearing officers, conducting bargaining agent elections, and by maintaining a list of qualified labor-management arbitrators, the Bureau seeks to meet the above mentioned objectives. The Bureau of Mediation Services administers certain sections of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 179. Basically, the Bureau provides four functions: the holding of mediation meetings; the holding of bargaining unit hearings; conducting bargaining unit elections; and maintaining a list of qualified labor-management arbitrators. Found in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 179 is the statutory language covering three distinct industries or areas of employment. The first is that language covering the private employment situat ion. The second involves employment in the public sector -state, county or municipal employment. And the third, employment situations involving charitable hospitals. In each of these three employment areas, the Bureau provides the same four duties: mediation, bargaining unit hearings, bargaining unit elections, and the maintenance of qualified arbitration list. Each of the four basic functions of the Bureau does not receive equal proportions of the Bureau's manpower. Approximately 85% of the total manpower available is assigned to the mediation function. Mediation is the process by which a third party acts as a catalyst for two parties having opposite or differing viewpoints. The mediator attempts, through a variety of techniques, to bring the parties to a point of mutual agreement on a particular item or items. When a staff member acts as a mediator, it is his responsibility to bring the parties together through the use of reason, suggestions, and information. He in no way makes a ruling or a decision, but rather must bring the parties into agreement through persuasion. It is only when a staff member acts as a hearing officer that he possesses certain binding authority. COUNCIL FOR THE HANDICAPPED* Metro Square Building 7th & Robert St., Suite 492 SI.

Supplementary information about these courts in this manual is indicated by page references. Supreme Court (see p.432 to 436) Jurisdiction: The Minnesota judicial system is headed by the supreme court, the state's court of last resort. The court consists of one chief justice and eight associate justices. Vacancies on the court are filled by governor's appointment. To the supreme court may be taken appeals from decisions of the state's district court and certain municipal courts. In some cases, matters may be presented directly to the supreme court without having been heard previously by a lower court. Under a 1957 law the chief justice of the supreme court is required to supervise and coordinate work of the state's district courts. In order to carry out these additional duties, the supreme court may provide by rule that the chief justice not be required to write opinions as a member of the court. This same law permits the court to provide by rule to hear cases in divisions, rather than have all members present at the hearing of a case. Terms: The supreme court has one court term each year beginning the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. This term generally continues until the end of the calendar year, with recesses at the discretion of the court. Election: Under the law, a candidate seeking election to the supreme court must specify that the candidate is filing for a specific justice's office which would otherwise become vacant. Pursuant to law, the supreme court each court term has appointed a judge of district court to act as a justice of the court in hearing and deciding cases. In recent years, the volume of cases before the court has been such that it has been necessary for the court to retain services of two commissioners for the predisposition screening of cases. District Court (see p. 437 to 451) Jurisdiction: There is one district court for the state of Minnesota, divided into ten judicial districts. The chief justice of the supreme court has the power to assign judges from one district to serve in another district. The constitution provides that the district court shall have original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as may be prescribed by law. At present the law provides for appeals from county court, probate court, municipal courts, and justices of the peace. In Ramsey and Hennepin counties the district courts have jurisdiction of juvenile court matters. In Ramsey county the district court judges assign a specific district judge to the juvenile division for a period of one year during which time the judge handles juvenile matters exclusively. In Hennepin county a judge is elected by the voters to the specific office of \"District Court Judge, Juvenile Division\", whose duty also is to give priority to juvenile cases. Election: Judges are elected by the voters of their respective districts for six-year terms. Candidates file for a specific judgeship, and this information is stated on the ballot. Judges are nominated and elected without party designation. County Court (see p.452 to 453) Jurisdiction: The county court system combines probate, municipal, and justice courts into one court and in some instances combines two or more counties into a single county court district. Hennepin and Ramsey counties are excluded from the county court law. The county court is divided into three divisions, civil and criminal, family court, and probate. The county court has civil jurisdiction where the amount in controversy does not exceed $5000 exclusive of interest and costs. The county court has criminal jurisdiction over misdemeanor, petty misdemeanor and preliminary hearing cases. The family court division includes all cases arising under the juvenile court act over which the county court has original exclusive jurisdiction and all cases arising out of or affecting the family relationship including civil commitments. The county court has concurrent jurisdiction with the district court over actions for divorce, separate maintenance, adoption, and change of name. The probate division hears all cases in law and in equity for the administration of estates of deceased persons and all guardianship and incompetency proceedings. In addition the county court may establish a traffic violations bureau and a conciliation court within the civil and criminal division. Election: Judges are elected by the voters of their respective county court districts for six-year terms. Candidates file for a specific judgeship, and this information is stated on the ballot. Judges are nominated and elected without party designation. Probate Courts Jurisdiction: Probate court jurisdiction is incorporated into the county court except in Hennepin and Ramsey counties which have a separate probate court with judges elected for six-year terms. The probate court has unlimited original jurisdiction in law and equity for the administration of the estates of deceased persons and all guardianship and incompetency proceedings. Municipal Court Jurisdiction: The only separate municipal courts in Minnesota are in Hennepin and Ramsey counties. Designated as Hennepin County Municipal Court and Ramsey County Municipal Court, these courts have jurisdiction in civil matters where the amount in controversy does not exceed $6000. Each county has a conciliation court with jurisdiction limited to civil actions involving $500 or less. Election: Municipal court judges are elected by voters of Hennepin and Ramsey counties for six-year /' terms. Justices of the Peace Jurisdiction: Elected for two-year terms in townships and cities which do not have regular county court sessions or a traffic violations bureau, justices of the peace have authority to receive pleas of guilty where no sentence of imprisonment is involved, to set bail in misdemeanor cases, to exercise civil jurisdiction in default matters up to $100 and to perform the marriage ceremony. 431 432 CHAPTER 5 JUDICIAL BRANCH SUPREME COURT State Capitol St. Pau I 55155 (612) 296-2581 Judges: One chief justice and eight associate justices.

HU\"ArtD CASS ClAy 458 :3 COUNTY OUTLINE MAP OF MINNESOTA SHOWING REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONS IN MINNESOTA The Regional Development Act of 1969 provided for creation of Regional Development Commissions (RDC) in Minnesota. Twelve RDC's have been created which together with the Metropolitan Council (established in 1967) cover all areas of the state. Steps in Organizing Most of the organizational activity occurred during 1973, including: selection of members, selection of officers, preparation and adoption of bylaws, selection of office location and recruiting of executive director and staff. The commissions were formed only after local governments representing a majority of the population in each region petitioned the governor requesting their formation. Each commission selects its own chairman, staff, and develops its own work program and priorities for act ion. Aids in Planning For fiscal year 1976, each commission prepared a detailed overall program design or work program to use as a management tool in conducting its activities. These work programs are vehicles for involving state agencies in the review of commission plans. State agencies have been invited to participate in the review sessions on each commission's plan. The governor has designated RDC's as regional clearinghouses. This means they have the authority to review applications from governmental units for state and federal assistance. The Office of Local and Urban Affairs in State Planning Agency has been charged with responsibility of coordinating the state's assistance program to RDC's: Region 3 4 5 6E 6W 7E 7W 8 9 10 11 State Planning Agency Room 101, Capitol Square Building 555 Cedar Street St. Paul, MN 55101 (612) 296-6662 Comparative Analysis of Minnesota Regions Population Average Area Land Use Family (Square Water Urban Rural Total Income Miles) Density Forested Cultivated Cover Urban 6 LOCAL ADMINISTRATION REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS Legal basis: Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462 Membership of regional development commissions consists of local elected officials-county, city, townsh ip, school board-who are selected by the groups they represent and representatives of public interest groups (selected by the elected officials) in the region.

Regional Development Commissions play only an advisory role. They do not have the power to operate programs or veto the plans or applications of local units of government Decentralization of many state functions has resulted in a variety of divisions of the state to administer services. The act states that such agencies use regional development commission boundaries when drafting administrative plans. As an example of this implementation, beginning September, 1975, Economic Development Regions of the state will be co-ter\u00ad minous with these commission boundaries.

January, 1977 The Metropolitan Council was created for the purpose of coordinating the planning and development of the seven County Metropolitan Area (Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington counties.) It began operations in August of 1967, and assumed all the powers, duties, obligations, and property carried or owned by the Twin Cities Metropolitan Planning Commission under Chapter 473 of Minnesota Statutes. The Council's main responsibilities are in the areas of metropolitan planning, coordination of local and special units of government, and in research and study, making recommenda\u00ad tions to the legislature based on its findings and conclusions. Planning The Council prepares a comprehensive development guide that consists of policy plans for metropolitan commissions and policy statements, goals, standards, programs and maps that recognize the physical, social, and economic needs of the Metropolitan Area. The guide is amended periodically. Coordination The basic mission of the Metropolitan Council is to coordinate planning and development. The Council prepares the regional plan for metropolitan commissions and reviews and approves the development programs that the commissions prepare to carry out the regional plan. The Council also reviews the long term comprehensive plans of other independent commissions, boards, and agencies in the region. If these plans are inconsistent with the development guide, the Council can suspend the plan pending modification. The Council reviews the long term comprehensive plans of local governments in the Area. It has 90 days to complete its review, and may suggest changes to bring inconsistent plans into conformity with the development guide or mediate intergovernmental disputes. In addition, the Council reviews all federal aid applications requiring regional review. The comments and recommendations of the Council become part of the application when submitted. Applications for federal or state aid in land acquisition under the land and water conservation fund of the Bureau of Recreation, open space program of Housing & Urban Development, and the state natural resources fund must have Council approval. Research The Metropolitan Council is charged with the responsibility of conducting research and study programs into a wide range of problems of an urban and metropolitan nature. Among these subjects are: municipal incorporations and annexations, land use, parks and open space needs, airports, highways, transit facilities, public hospitals, libraries, schools, other public buildings, air and water pollution, solid waste disposal, storm water drainage, the tax structure and assessment practices, and the consolidation of common local government services. The Metropolitan Council is financed by a tax levy of up to .23 of a mill on all taxable property in the Metropolitan Area, and by Federal and state grants. The Council is also authorized to bond for water pollution control programs and regional park acquisition and development.

The Commission manages a Metropolitan Disposal System consisting of six sewer service areas, 21 wastewater treatment plants, nearly 400 miles of interceptor sewers and numerous support facilities (laboratories, metering and water quality monitoring points, lift stations, etc.)-serving 101 area communities. The Commission formulates and implements a development program aimed at meeting all State and federal pollution control regulations and carrying out the waste management policy plan of the Metropolitan Council. The Commission is an operating agency of the Metropolitan Council, which appoints eight of nine total commissioners to serve overlap\u00ad ping four year terms representing precincts that are combinations of two contiguous Council districts. The chairman is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. MINNESOTA'S 87 COUNTIES Government: Counties are governed by a board of commissioners and administra\u00ad tive officers elected by the people. State law allows alternative forms of government, chiefly to allow for an elected executive, a manager, or administra\u00ad tor, and the option to make administrative offices appointive. Functions: During the decade of the seventies, the legislature has increased the responsibilities of county government. A county court system has been established (see p. 452, this manual); counties are developing shorelands management and solid waste management systems. Counties have authority for planning and zoning, to establish housing and redevelopment authorities and to direct the assessing function (except in cities over 30,000 population) in addition to regular duties such as administration for the state of welfare, elections, vital statistics, tax levies, and highways.

Annually the commission selects from its members a chairman who possesses the powers and duties prescribed by the general law that is applicable to the heads of state departments and agencies. All appointees must be state residents for five years prior to appointment. When the commission holds hearings, the local county board selects two of its members to serve with the three regular members. Members: Thomas J. Simmons, Chairman Robert W Johnson Gerald J. Isaacs Home Olivia. ...... Anoka .. St. Paul Executive Assistant Executive Secretary: Patricia D. Lundy Functions: Term Expires June 30, 1981 June 30, 1977 June 30, 1979 Legislative intent in creating the Minnesota Municipal Commission reflected these findings: (1) sound urban development is essential to the continued economic growth of this state; (2) municipal government is necessary to provide the governmental services essential to sound urban development and for the protection of health, safety, and welfare in areas being used intensively for residential, institutional and governmental purposes or in areas undergoing such development; (3) the public interest requires that municipalities be formed when there exists or will likely exist the necessary resources to provide for their economical and efficient operation; (4) annexation to or consolidation with existing municipalities or unincorporated areas unable to supply municipal services should be facilitated; and (5) the consolidation of municipalities should be incouraged. The Minnesota Municipal Commission is empowered to promote and regulate development of municipal\u00ad ities so that the public interest in efficient local government will be properly recognized and served. Minnesota was the first state in the country to establish an independent administrative commission to hear and decide questions of municipal incorporation and boundary adjustment. The municipal commission law has been adopted by the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations as a 'model statute' and has now been enacted by several other states. In 1969, the Legislature added an 'orderly annexation' section to the law which allows the commission to assist local communities in developing comprehensive long range agreements for the orderly extension of municipal boundaries and services. CITIES IN MINNESOTA Government: Home rule charters (as authorized by the state constitution) or the statutory city code (formerly the village code) govern cities. Home Rule Charter cities may establish any form of government they choose in their charters. There are 27 council-manager cities, 4 commission cities, and the rest have mayor-council form. Statutory cities may choose form of government from three alternatives. There are 15 plan B cities (council-manager); others are one or another form of plan A (mayor -council, with either elected or appointed clerk). The City Code applies to all former villages (now statutory cities) and is regarded as one of the more flexible local government acts in the United States. Functions: Police, and fire protection, street maintenance, sewer and water, parks and recreation, are traditional city services. In addition, a statutory city may choose to provide utilities, sell liquor, operate an airport, and provide ambulance service, among other options.

Inquiries received in St. Paul indicate that one of Minnesota's more respected exports is effective innovation in government. 510 CHAPTER 7 STATES' GOVERNMENT ANATOMY OF THE STATES The 50 state governments in the United States all draw their power from those responsibili\u00ad ties which the United States Constitution does not direct to itself. The internal functions of each state in the areas of such as education, transportation, welfare and elections are to a large degree the responsibility of state government. Each of the states maintains a legislature. Nebraska is the only state with a unicameral (one house) legislature as well as the only state which elects its legislators on a non-partisan basis. The sizes of the legislatures also vary, from New Hampshire with 423 members to Nebraska with 49. The length of sessions and the frequency with which they meet also vary. Each of the 50 states is unique in the problems and challenges its government must meet. lust as no two states are exactly alike, neither are their needs, and as a result, neither are their governments. The executive branch of states' government is just as varied as the legislative. Some states have opted for a cabinet form of government in which the governor appoints the other executive members of the state government, generally with the approval of at least one house of the legislature. Most states, however, still elect at least some if not most of their state officials in statewide general elections. The power of each state government is considerable. Each possesses a wide range of choices in what it shall do, how its government shall be organized, and how it shall finance its services. Furthermore, only an amendment to the United States Constitution approved by three-fourths of the states, could jeopardize the autonomy the states presently enjoy. Additional information about government in the fifty states (including compensation of administrative officials and state legislators) is available from: The Council of State Governments Iron Works Pike Lexington, Kentucky 40511 (606) 252-2291 MINNESOTA IN THE FIFTY STATES Minnesotans comprise 1.87% oi the United States population and inhabit 2.33% oi the United States land area.

Election 74 marked the return to nomination and election of state representatives with political party designation. In 1976 state senators alsowill return to nomination and election with political party designation.1974 General Election Returns in this manual for Congress, legislature, and statewide offices are desig\u00ad nated by legislative district. 548 CHAPTER 10 ELECTIONS ElECTION '76 1976 offers Minnesotans the biennial opportunity to become directly involved in the state and national political process. To be elected are ten Presidential Electors, one United States Senator, eight Representatives in Congress, and 201 state legislators. In addition, contests for state, regional, county and local governmental and judicial offices complete the nonpartisan ballot. Where do elections begin? Constitutions and charters provide the basic framework for elections by defining the qualifications for voting and the offices to be elected and the qualifications and terms for each. Statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations spell out details for administering these elections. In Minnesota statutes define political parties and regulate the conduct of primary elections for partisan and nonpartisan offices. What is a politic;al party? Minnesota law defines \"political party:' as an organization presenting candidates in the last preceding general election one or more of whom has been voted \"for in each county in the state and shall have received not less than 5% of the total vote cast for all candidates in that election. Two parties consistently qualify under this law: Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and Republican Party* Recognition of political parties is regulated by state law, and their constitutions are filed with the Secretary of State. Who ioins a party? Since voters do not register with a declaration of political party, they may choose to affiliate with a party in a variety of ways, including attending its precinct caucus and declaring intent to support that party's candidates in the next election. What is a precinct caucus? The legal process of the general election year begins with political party precinct caucuses the fourth Tuesday evening of February. A precinct is an election area which has one polling place. Each of the almost 4000 precincts will elect delegates to represent their residents directly and indirectly at county, district and state conventions. Delegates representing Minnesota at Democratic and Republican national nominating conventions in 1976 will be chosen at each party's state convention. What is a priniary election? In Minnesota the purpose of a primary election is to nominate political party candidates to the general election ballot and to reduce the number of candidates for a nonpartisan office to no. more than. twice the number to b.e elected in the ge\u00b7neral election. -Partisan candidates, therefore, run among themselves in such an election, and the choice of candidates is within the party. The choice of who will be elected to hold an office is deferred to the general election, when the surviving candidates from each party are presented tothe voters for the voters'. choice. \"\"Named changed to Independent-Republicans of Minnesota, November 15,1975 How are other parties' candidates nominated? Other parties or groups may place one or more candidates on the general election ballot by nomination petitions signed by 2,000 voters for a statewide office, 1,000 voters for Congress, 500 voters for county or legislative office. What is a general election? All candidates nominated either in the primary election or by petition appear on the general election ballot the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November every even numbered year. A candidate who did not win nomination in the primary election may not run in the general election. Voters may write in the names of persons for whom they wish to vote if they do not appear on the ballot. Whose vote counts? Every vote is counted in every election. Active citizens compound their electoral influence by early participation in the process of candidate nomination and selection of political party platform issues. First in every general election year is the precinct caucus of the political party. Citizens who vote there for officers and delegates to local and state conventions add an extra measure of participation in the democratic process. Citizens seeking an appropriate commitment to begin the Third Century of the United States may elect personal involvement in Election 76 as a rededication to government of, by and for the people.
