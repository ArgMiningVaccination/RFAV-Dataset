Post Partum Depression/Anxiety/Anger: The transition into motherhood is accompanied with many obstacles; for some, this includes struggles with mood instability. This is a very understandable phenomenon given the drastic change in hormones and nutrient balance, coupled with sleep deprivation. As specialists in perinatal mood imbalances, we assess the WHOLE person, including, hormone imbalances, nutrient imbalances, thyroid dysfunction, blood sugar instability, inflammation, sleep disturbances, and more! We often find that simple changes elicit substantial results. Mood imbalances are incredibly common, but they are absolutely treatable- and medication is not your only option! Often times, we can effectively rebalance your neurotransmitters with the sole use of nutrients and herbs- so you do not have to worry about medication impacting your breastfeeding baby! It is our goal to ensure you are THRIVING, not simply surviving. Chronic ILlness We've noticed that many of our mom's who have children with chronic illness are also suffering with health concerns themselves. Whether you are dealing with autoimmunity, chronic fatigue, hormone imbalances, mood instability, digestion problems, sleep issues, or skin concerns, we are here to support you! We take a comprehensive individualized approach and examine ALL of the potential factors impacting your health, including, toxin/environmental exposure, gut health, nutrition factors, hidden infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic), stress and trauma, and hormonal imbalances. We are committed to finding the root cause of your symptoms and will not stop until we do! Prevention We love working with mamas who are looking to take a proactive approach and cultivate an environment of health within their home and for their families!
