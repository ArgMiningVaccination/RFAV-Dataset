AMENDMENT RATIONALE Amendment 3 The protocol dated 12 October 2018 was amended to update the medical monitor contact information, as well as provide an update to the stats section. Amendment 2 Amendment 2 dated 12 Sep 2018 of the protocol A -101-WART -301 has been amended to include subje cts 1 years of age and to clarify the application procedures for younger subjects randomized to the study. This change in inclusion criteria is at the request of the FDA following a review of the pediatric plan for this program. Amendment 1 The protocol dated 09 July 2018 has been amended to change the patient instruction sheet, to provide updated information on how to return the used applicators to the site for final accountability. The rationale for this change is to simplify the instructions provided for any product which may remain in the applicator after it is applied at home, by removing the need to express any remaining product and the need to use a sharps container for disposal. The protocol was also amended to clarify that cantharidin has a 28 day wash out window prior to joining the study, and that the concomitant use of cantharidin is prohibited while on study . Lastly, the study title has been updated throughout the document to include the branded study name, THWART. 1.1.

SYNOPSIS Protocol Number A -101-WART -302 Synopsis Protocol Number : A-101-WART 30 2 THWART 2: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with Common Warts Sponsor: Aclaris Therapeutics Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Drug Description: A-101 Solution contains 45% hydrogen peroxide that will be supplied in a single use applicator to be applied directly to common warts (verruca vulgaris) twice a week . The study drug, A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 45% Topical Solution (hereafter referred to as A -101) is a colorless solution that must be stored at room temperature ( 15-25\u00ba C or 59 -77 \u00ba F). The blinded vehicle solution is packaged to match the active study drug and will be stored under the same conditions. Study Objectives: Primary: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of A-101 45% compared to Vehicle when applied twice weekly to common warts. Secondary : The secondary objectives of this study include: Duration of response Onset of action of A -101 45% . Safety A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 8 Study Design: This is a phase 3 , multicenter, randomized vehicle controlled, double blind parallel group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of A -101 45 % vs Vehicle in subjects with common warts . Investig ators will be required to identify at least 1 and up to 6 clearly identifiable c ommon warts for treatment with A-101 study medication. All identified common warts will be treated twice a week for up to 8 weeks (maximum of 16 treatment applications) . Subje cts will be followed for 12 weeks after Visit 9. Approximately 500 subject s will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms in a 1: 1 ratio . Of the 500 subjects randomized, approximately 100 subjects will be between 1 and 17years of age . The duration of study participation is anticipated to be up to a maximum of 15 8 days per subject. Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), vital signs, assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), physical exams, and concomitant medication review. Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart according to the Physician Wart Assessment (P WA)scale . The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments or previous assessments to assist with this evaluation. Sites will be required to take standardized color photographs to assist with the documentation of the appearance and location of each identified common wart throughout the study. These photographs are not to be used when performing the PWA. Number of Patie nts to be Enrolled: Approximately 500 subjects will be randomized to the study. Number of Study Sites: This study will be conducted in the US only at approximately 25 treatment centers. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 12 Criteria for Evaluation Efficacy: The investigator will evaluate the severity of the identified Wart s using the Physician Wart Assessment ( PWA ) scale . Safety: Safety will be evaluated by following adverse events, clinical laboratory exams, vital signs, concomitant medications, as well as through the assessment of local skin reactions, skin examinations and general physical exams. Study Drug Administration Study drug medication will be applied to each identified common wart which meets the requirements for retreatment twice a week for up to 8 weeks (maximum of 16 applications) . At Visit 2, subjects who are 18 years of age or older will apply the A -101 study medication in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational site staff who is a trained healthcare professional. The second weekly application of the A -101 study medication will be applied by the subject at home. Subjects between the ages of 1 and 17 years of age will have their A -101 study medication applied in the offic e by a parent or legal guardian in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational site staff. The second weekly A -101 study medication application will be applied at home by a parent or a legal guardian. Study medication mu st be applied to each identified common wart for approximately 15 seconds. The treated wart must remain undisturbed for an additional approximately 15 seconds. This treatment cycle must be repeated up to 3 times to the common wart . If severe erythema an d edema develop, then the treatment cycle should be discontinued for that specific treatment application. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

To assess the impact of miss ing data imputation on the primary analysis results a tipping point analysis will be conducted. This analysis will shift the treatment coefficient in the regression model used in the MI procedure to impose a worse mean maximum PWA for the A -101 45% arm and a better mean maximum PWA for the vehicle arm. Details of this tipping point analysis will be specified in the SAP. In addition, a model similar to the primary analysis model but stratified instead by Study Center will be performed as a sensitivity ana lysis including a Breslow -Day test to evaluate heterogeneity across sites. .........................................60 15.4.

Summary Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by infection of keratinocytes by subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV) family. Cutaneous HPV subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papillomavirus family that is ca pable of infecting humans and causing cutaneous lesions. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most commonly through direct contact with individuals who harbor the virus clinically (evident lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly through exposure to contaminated surfaces, or even by autoinoculation of virus from individual lesions to adjacent uninfected skin. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar and plantar warts, mosa ic warts, flat warts, and butcher's warts. Common warts are generally small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodules and are typically associated with HPV subtypes 1, 2 or 4 though other subtypes are reported. Lesions are most com monly located on the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by autoinoculation from the finger/hand lesions . In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than 2 years. However, they often persist for many years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightl y (e.g., face, hands), spread to distant anatomical regions by autoinoculation, be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at ri sk for significant morbidity . There are currently no specific antiviral therapies available to treat cutaneous HPV infection and there is no FDA -approved topical treatment for cutaneous common warts. Existing therapies, many of which are off - label uses of drugs approved for other indications, and many of which have never undergone the drug approval process, are of unproven safety and/or efficacy, and are generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative modalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, application of acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapies, such as topical podophyllin, cantharidin, topical or intralesional 5- fluorouracil, or dibutyl ester) or lesion removal. Several of these therapies are also available as over -the- counter (OTC) wart therapies in l esser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., topical salicylic acid preparations, home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be effective in some cases. While these methods may achieve cure in some cases, many require multiple visits to a physician's office, and may require providers with specialized training and the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require anest hesia and/or analgesia, and they can be complicated by adverse cosmetic outcomes including scarring at the treatment site, as well as the typical post- surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy is Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 23 consistently effective in all cases and, in f act, there is great variability among practitioners in the methods employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the results . Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topical agent noted above, H2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858. ( Schumb, 1955) (Chan, 200 8) (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) (Zonios, 2007) . H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin non- enzymatic components including acid, urates and glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and The application of supra -physi ologic concentrations of H 2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O 2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells . An le-controlled, parallel group study of hydrogen peroxide solution in adult subjects with common warts of the hand (WART -01), was conducted utilizing once weekly applications (maximum of four applications) of A -101 (hydrogen peroxide) 40% topical solution or placebo (vehicle) topical solution to investigate the potential utility of a 40% hydrogen peroxide topical solution for the treatment of common warts on the hands. A total of 15 subjects received 4 study medication applications. One subject achieved complete clearance of the Target Wart during the investigation, and data from this pilot study demonstrated a statistically significant trend towards clearing warts in the A -101 40% group when compared with the vehicle. It was the Investigator's opinion that \" 1 or 2 additional treatments may clear the warts as most A -101 40% treated warts were \"Near Clear\" at the end of the four -week study\". The administration of A -101 40% over four applications one week apart showed no untoward effects and the treatment was well tolerated by all subjects. The data and clinical observations suggest that a larger study allowing greater than four drug applications and evaluating additional doses of A -101 topical solution are warranted . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 24 5.2. Study Rationale Aclaris has conducted three ( 3) Phase 2 studies to determine the dose response and dose f requency of A-101 (H2O2) Topical Solution in patients with common warts. The three studies conducted are identified below and they represent data collected from 406 subjects . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 25 Study A -101-WART -201: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel- Group, Study of A -101 Solution in Subjects with Common Warts (n=90). Study A -101-WART -202: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Once a Week in Subjects with Common Warts (n=157). Study A -101-WART -203: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with Common Warts (n=159). The results from Study A -101-WART -201 evaluated two of A-101 (H2O2) Topical 45% (w/w) compared with vehicle. The 45% (w/w) concentrations demonstrated clinically and statistically significant results in clearing warts while the 40% concentration had no effect when compared with vehicle. Therefore, A -101 40% topical solution was judged to be an ineffective concentration and not evaluated in further Phase 2 studies. The results from Study A -101-WART -202, which evaluated a 45% (w/w) concentration of A - 101 (H2O2) Topical Solution when treating a single target wart and up to 3 additional warts showed that the 45% concentration applied once weekly resulted in a clinicall y and statistically significant clearing of warts at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the end of a 12 -week post- treatment follow- up (Day 134). The results from Study A -101-WART -203, which evaluated a 45% concentration of A -101 (H2O2) Topica l Solution administered twice weekly to a single target wart and up to 5 additional warts showed that the 45% (w/w) concentrations resulted in clinically and statistically significant clearing of the target wart and all treated warts at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the end of a 12 -week, post- treatment follow- up (Day 134). The results from Study WART- 203 were clinically and statistically significant clearance of warts at the end of the treatment period (Day 56) and at the end of a 12 -week post -treatment follow -up (Day 134), with consistently earlier and stronger results than the data from Study WART -202 which incorporated a once weekly dose regimen. A-101 (H 2O2) 45% (w/w) Topical Solution administered once weekly and twice weekly was well tolerated. Treatment emergent adverse events were predominantly mild and unrelated to study medication. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) were predominantly mild and transient. The LSRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects, and crusting, edema, erythem a, and scaling reported by the investigator following treatment generally resolved by Visit 13 (Day 134). There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital signs. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 35 4Vital signs [including temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, height and weight (Visit 1 only)] will be measur ed by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13. 5Prior medications/the rapies will be collected for a time -period of 1 4 days prior to Visit 2. Refer to Section 11 for a list of permitted and restricted concomitant medi cations. 6A complete blood count (including hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, red blood cell count and morphology , white blood cell count and differential (absolute and %) including basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase total protein, and uric acid. 7The treating investigator will identify at least 1 and up to 6 common warts located on the trunk or extremities that meet the inclusion criteria outlined in Section 7. 8 The investigat or will use the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) scale to assess each identified common wart . The investigator must assess the identified common warts prior to application of the study medication at Visit 2- Visit 9. In order to be eligible for randomization at Visit 2, each common wart must have a PWA grade 2. 9 The investigator will measure the dimensions (longest axis and thickness of the common wart ) at Visit 1 and prior to randomization at Visit 2. In order for the subject to be randomized at Visit 2 the identified common warts must have the specific dimensions outlined in Section 12.1. The investigator will be required to measure the longest axis of each common wart at Visits 2 -13. 10 At Visits 1, Visit 2, 4, 6, and 9 (prior to study medication application), and Visit 10- 13, a qualified inves tigational center staff member will take a photograph of each identified common wart using the Aclaris supplied camera. All photographs will be sent to a central imaging laboratory. 11At a sub -set of investigational sites (up to 3 sites), subjects rando mized at these sites will have additional standardized photographs taken of their common warts at the following time -points: V2- 10 minutes post application, 1- hour post application and 24 hours post application. 12Subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 prior to application of study medication. Investigational study staff will re -confirm subject eligibility prior to randomization. 13 The investigator and subject will assess each identified common wart for local sk in reactions associated with irritation at Visits 2 -13. At Visit 2 -Visit 9 , the investigator and subject will assess each identified common wart for LSRs prior to the application of the study medication . Refer to Section 13.1 for the complete list of Local Skin Reaction signs and symptoms. 14 During in -office visits, subjects 18 years of age and older will appl y their A -101 study medication in the pr esence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational study staff that has been trained on the protocol . Subjects ages 1 to 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a parent/legal guardian in front of the treating physician or a member of the investigational study staff during in- office visits. If the identified common wart meets the criteria Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 36 for re -treatment as defined in Section 10.6 the lesion will be re -treated at Visits 3 -9. Following application of study medication, subjects must NOT wash/submerge t he treated wart for at least 6 hours and they must NOT apply any topical products to the treated common warts for at least 6 hours. Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry.15All subjects will receive their second weekly treatment of the A -101 study medication at home on Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 25, 32, 39, 46, 5 3 as determined by the PWA assessment performed during the in- office visit . Subjects ages 1 to 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a parent or legal guardian. All subjects will need to document the application o f A-101 study medication in a subject diary. The second weekly treatment will depend on the PWA performed during the in- office visit that week. If the identified common wart meets the criteria for re -treatment during the in- office visit, then the subject/parent/guardian will perform the second weekly treatment at home. 16All concomitant therapies including (topical and oral) prescription medications, over the counter medications and natural sup plements and non- drug therapies including chiropractic, physical therapy, and energy- based therapy must be documented in the subject CRF. Subjects must not apply any topical products ( e.g., moisturizers, sunscreen, etc.) to the identified common wart within 12 hours prior to any study visit. 17The reporting period for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) begins when the subject signs the informed consent and continues through Visit 11. Refer to Section Section 14.1.2 for instructions on the reporting of SAEs. Non -serious clinical adverse events will be collected following the application of the study medication at Visit 2 and through Visit 11. Non -serious adverse events that occur between the tim e of consent and study medication application will be documented as medical history. All safety reporting (AEs and SAEs) will conclude at Visit 11 (approximately 28 days after last study medication application) except for clinical adverse events related to local skin reactions.

The randomization list will be stored with limited access to designated personnel for study medication labeling. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 38 Subjects will be randomized to the study in a 1: 1 ratio and stratified by investigational study site. Sites will be shipped study medic ation in blocks of 4. Once a subject is determined to have met all inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria, the site will pull the next sequential drug kit from their supply and enter the drug kit number into the E DC system. 10.3. Study medication packaging, storage, and dispensing A-101 45% and matching Vehicle will be provided by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and labeled according to applicable regulatory requirements. The study medication will be packaged in single use applicat ors. The ampoule is provided inside a sealed polyethylene tube with a flocked, doe foot applicator on one end. Subject kits will contain 20 study medication applicators. The blinded subject kits will remain at the investigational site and the site staff will dispense a study medication applicator to the subject for the at home treatment visit. T he outside of each subject kit and each individual treatment applicator will be labelled in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A-101 study medication must be stored in a location where there is limited access at 59\u00baF to 77\u00baF (15\u00baC to 25\u00baC) protected from excessive heat, open flame and combustibles, out of direct sunlight and in a well -ventilated, dry area . Proper storage of the A -101 study medi cation must be reviewed with the subject prior to dispensing the blinded subject kit. Investigational study medication supplies are only to be used for subjects properly consented and randomized to this study. 10.4. Drug Accountability The investigator or designee will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the study medications as shipped by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee), including the date received and the condition of the study medications. One copy of this receipt will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee) when the contents of the study medication shipment have been verified and one copy maintained in the study file. In addition, an accurate study medication disposition record will be kept, specifying t he amount dispensed for each subject and the date of dispensing. This inventory record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original inventory record will be available for review by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. upon request . Final drug accountability will be completed by the CRA at the completion of the study and all unused study medication will be returned to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. drug depot for disposal per Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee's) written instructions . 10.5. Study Medication Treatment The study medications are for external, topical use only and are to be applied only to those subjects that have been properly consented and randomized to the study . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 39 The investigational center staff member m ust compl y with the study medication storage conditions outlined in Section 10.1 During Visit 2 -Visit 9 (if the identified common wart meets the criteria for retreatment) , the investigational study staff will select the appropriate study medication applicator for treatment of a specific subject. Subjects ages 18 years of age and older will apply the appropriately labeled A - 101 study medication to the identified common wart in the presence of the treating investigator or investigational staff that has been trained on the protocol. The second weekly application of the A -101 study medication will be applied by the subject at home (Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, and 53) . The second weekly treatment will be determined by the PWA assessment performed during the in- office visit. If the identified common wart meets the criteria for retreatment, then the subject will apply the A -101 study medication at home. Subjects between the ages of 1 and 17 years of age will have their A -101 study medication applied in the office by a parent or legal guardian in the presence of the treating physician or a member of the investigational site staff during Visit 2 -Visit 9 . The second weekly A -101 study medication application will be applied at home by a parent or a legal guardian (Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, and 53) . The second weekly treatment will be determined by the PWA assessment performed during the in -office visi t. If the wart meets the criteria for retreatment, then the subject will apply the A -101 study medication at home. Retreatment Criteria: At Visit 3-9, if the identified common wart has a PWA grade of >0 then the subject will receive re- treatment with the A-101 study medication treatment . However , treatment with the A -101 study medication should not be applied if any of the following criteria apply to the identified common wart : The common wart has a pre-treatment LSR grade of 3 (severe) for any sign or sy mptom AND the grade has increased compared to the previous visit. The common wart is, in the investigator's opinion, not appropriate for a retreatment (the investigator must note the reason on the subject's Comments CRF page). The common wart , in the Investigator's opinion, cannot be visualized so the Investigator cannot assess the PWA. If the identified common wart meets the criteria for re -treatment during the in -office visit (PWA>0), then the subject/parent/legal guardian should treat the common wart at home on the protocol defined at home treatment days ( Days 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 46, 5 3. A window of +1 day is allowed ). If the subject is unable to tolerate treatment the day of an at home treatment visit due to severe skin irritation, then the treatment should be held and the investigational site should be notified. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 40 Subject s whose identified common wart (s) is assessed at a particular visit (V3 -V9) to be a PWA=0 will not have the that common wart re -treated at that visit (or retreated at the second at home application that week). 10.6. Preparing the Study Medication for Application To perform a study medication treatment for the identified common wart a staff member will select the appropriate study medication applicator from the identified subject's kit. The following instructions outline the procedure for application of the stud y medication to the identified common wart . During each in- office treatment visit, the Investigational Study Staff will be responsible for reviewing the following instructions with the subject/parent/legal guardian and ensure that they understand how to properly prepare the applicator and apply the A -101 study medication. For the in -office treatment applications, the Investigational Study Staff member will p repare the A-101 study medication applicator for all subjects, regardless of age by : o Washing their hands prior to, and after completing the study medication treatments o Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are prohibited o Visually inspect the applicator for damage: If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact the study monitor for disposal instructions and select an unused applicator with the next highest number for the treatment If the applicator is intact, proceed with the applicator preparation process as outlined in Figure 1. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 41 Figure 1: Diagram Showing the Process for Preparing A -101 Study Medication 1. Each common wart should be cleaned using an alcohol wipe prior to application of A -101 45%. 2. Hold the applicator so that the applicator cap is pointing up. 3. Crush the ampule in the applicator by applying pressure to the center of the barrel of the applicator. 4. Remove the sleeve. 5. Tap the barrel of the applicator to ensure the solution is free of the crushed ampule. 6. Gently remove the cap by twisting while pulling away from the applicator. 7. Express a single drop of A -101 45% so that the tip of the applicator becomes wet. 8. Apply the solution to the identified wart s in a circular motion . All subjects will be supplied with treatment application instruction sheets at the completion of each in -office visit. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 42 10.7. Applying Study Medication All subjects that a re between the ages of 1 and 17 will have their A -101 study medication applied by a parent/legal guardian . Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry. For in -office visits, the subject's parent or legal guardian will apply the A -101 study medication in front of a member of the investig ational study staff to ensure there is a clear understanding regarding how the study medication should be handled. Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply their A -101 study medication to his/her identified common warts in the presence of the treating physician or member of the investigational staff during in -office visits. The second weekly application will be performed at home. The following instructions will be used by all subjects/parents/legal guardians applying A -101 study medication to all identified common warts : Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open wounds Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are prohibited (All subjects will be supplied with nitrile or vinyl examination gloves to be used for at home applications) Thoroughly cleanse the common wart by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart , squeez e in the middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the common wart . Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, move the applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the lesion. Apply the study medication for approximat ely 15 seconds. Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe . Ensure the i dentified common wart is fully saturated with study medicatio n at the end of the ~15 second application Allow the treated wart to remain undisturbed for ~ 15 seconds After ~ 15 seconds repeat the ~15 second application process Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study med ication has been applied to each identified Wart up to 3 times. If severe erythema and edema develop, then the treatment cycle should be discontinued for that specific treatment application . Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and dry the common wart and the surrounding skin without wiping or rubbing. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 43 10.8. Dose Modification If a subject refuses to have a study medication treatment the investigator must report the visit number, visit date, and state the reason the subject refused to allow treatment in the subject's CRF . If the subject's refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must also report the event on the appropriate CRF . 10.9. Breaking the Blind The blind may be broken ONLY in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study medic ation identity is critical to the management of the subject's course of treatment. Before breaking the blind , the investigator should determine that the information is necessary. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medicat ion-related, the problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the subject is receiving an active study medication without the need for unblinding. If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, attempt to contact the Medical Monitor to obtain permission to break the blind of a particular subject. If it is not possible to contact the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 44 11. PREVIOUS AND CONCOMI TANT THERAPIES 11.1. Previous Thera py During Visit 1, the investigator or designee will question the subject to ensure they have not used any excluded therapies within the specified period prior to Visit 2 to the identified common warts : Intralesional Therapy o Immunotherapy ( e.g., Candida antigen, mumps antigen, Trichophyton antigen) ; weeks o Anti-metabolite therapy ( e.g., bleomycin, 5 -fluorouracil); 8 weeks o Immunomodulatory/immunosuppressant therapy e.g., etanercept, alefacept, infliximab); 16 weeks -steroids (inhaled and intra -nasal steroids are permitted); 28 days Topical Therapy o LASER (e.g ., pulsed -dye laser [PDL], photodynamic therapy [PDT], other energy -based ( e.g., 5-fluorouracil); 8 weeks o Retinoids; 90 days o Liquid nitrogen, electrodesiccation, curettage; 60 days o Over -the-counter (OTC) wart therapies and cantharidin ; 28 da ys 11.2. Concomitant Therapies Concomitant therapies are any new or existing therapy received from Visit 1 until discharge from the study . Concomitant therapies include drug ( e.g., prescription, over -the-counter [OTC]) and non- drug (e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy, energy -based treatments) therapies. Subjects will refrain from receipt of any therapy in compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects should refrain from changing the use of any concomitant therapies during the study. All new or modi fied concomitant therapies used during the study must be recorded in the subject CRF. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 45 11.3. Prohibited Therapies During the course of this study, subjects are prohibited from using the following treatment therapies to treat the identified common warts : Intralesional Therapy o Immunotherapy ( e.g., Candida antigen, ( bleomycin, and intra -nasal permitted); Topical Therapy o LASER (e.g ., pulsed -dye therapy other nitrogen, electrodesiccation, curettage; Over -the-count er (OTC) wart therapies and cantharidin . The investigator should notify the Medical Monitor immediately if any prohibited therapies are required to ensure subject safety. Starting with Visit 2, subjects must not apply any topical products ( e.g., moisturizers, sunscreens, etc.) to th eir identified common warts within 12 hours prior to any study visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed) . After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed subjects must NOT wash/submerge the treated commo n wart for at least 6 hours and must not apply any topical products to the treated common wart for at least 6 hours . Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 46 12. ASSESSEMENTS OF CLIN ICAL EFFICACY 12.1. Common Wart Identification At Visit 1, the investigator will identify at le ast one 1 and up to 6 common warts for treatment and evaluation. At Visit 1, each identified common w art must: Have a longest axis that is 3 mm and 8 mm Have a thickness 3mm Be a discrete lesion , i.e. each wart meeting the entry criteria must be clearly separated from other warts Be present for at least 4 weeks Not be a periungual, subungual, genital , anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform wart Not be in an intertriginous fold Not be covered wi th hair which, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study medication treatments or the study evaluations Not be in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by clothing or footwear or in a skin fold). Record the location of each identified common wart on the body charts in the CRFs indicating landmarks and distances to assist with confirming the location of the identified common wart at subsequent visits . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 47 12.2. Standardized Photography At Visits 1, 2 , 4, 6, 9- 13 a qualified inve stigational center staff member will take standardized color photographs of each identified common wart . Subjects at a sub -set of investigational sites (up to 3) will have additional standardized photographs taken of their each ident ified common wart at the following time -points: V2: 10 minutes post application V2: 1 -hour post application V2: 24- hour post application The photographs are to document the appearance and location of the each identified common wart. The subject's ident ity will not be revealed in the study photographs . At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application. Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the camera and camera settin gs are used for each photograph. Sites will be provided with photography e quipment and s upplies necessary for obtaining the common wart photographs. D etailed instructions for obtaining and managing the photographs will be documented i n the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the site at the study initiation visit.Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 48 12.3. Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) The Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator's assessment of the severity of each identified common wart at a pa rticular time point. The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA performed at any other visit. At every study visit, the Investigator will assess each identified common wart and report the one integer that best describes the common wart severity using the following scale. At any visit where a study medication treatment is performed, the PWA must be completed prior to the treatment visit. Physician's Wart Assessment Grade Descri ptor 0 Clear: No visible wart. No further treatment is indicated 1 Near Clear: a visible wart that is less than 3 mm in maximal diameter (or length) 2 A visible wart 3 mm and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length) 3 A visible wart 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length) The physician is encouraged to use a ruler or caliper and to feel the wart or skin area to help his/her assessment. At Visit 1 for the subject to be enrolled and at Visit 2 for the subject to be randomized each identified wart must have a PWA grade 2. At Visits 3 -9, identified common warts must have a PWA > 0 to be retreated. If the Investigator cannot assess the PWA for a common wart (e.g., the common wart cannot be visualized because of an LSR such as edema, scabbing, etc.) she/he must report the reason in the subject's CRFs. The identified common wart must not be retreated at that visit, and the subject should be seen at the next scheduled visit. All at home treatment visits will be based on the PWA score during the in -office visit. Refer to Appendix 2 for the PWA Site Manual. 12.4. Subject Instructions An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject at Visit 1 (Refer to Appendix 1). Throu ghout the study, the Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 49 Continue their routine cleansing regimen except they should avoid vigorous scrubbing of the identified common warts (e.g., loofah, back brushes, scrubbing straps, abrasive washcloths, sponges and cleansing pads, etc.) Continue their routine cosmetics and skin care products Avoid exposing the identified common warts to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet radiation (e.g., sunlight, tanning beds) and use sunscreen on the common warts , if excessive exposure cannot b e avoided Avoid activities that might irritate the common warts . Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray tans near the common warts . Bring the subject instruction sheet and subject diary with them to each visit. Follow all instructions for the proper application of the A -101 study medication when applying product at home. On study visit days, the subjects should: Wear loose fitting clothing to the visit (Note: clothing that comes in contact with the study medication may be bleached) Starting wit h Visit 2, not apply any topical products to the identified common wart within 12 hours prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed) After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was performed DO NOT: o Wash/ submerge the treated common wart for at least 6 hours o Apply any topical products to the treated common wart for at least 6 hours . 12.5. Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry. Other Study Supplies Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide: An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for meas uring of all common wart dimensions ; Supplies and instructions for collecting, labeling, shipping and result reporting for the clinical laboratory tests from ACM Laboratories ; Nitrile examination gloves Equipm ent, supplies and training for taking standardized photographs ; Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 50 13. ASSESMENT OF SAFETY In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety assessments according to the schedules noted below . 13.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) The LSR assessment is the Investigator's assessment of the signs and the subject's assessment of the symptoms associated with irritation at the identified common wart site ( i.e., the common wart and the skin immediately surrounding the common wart exposed to study medication). The Investigator may refer to previous photographs to assist with these assessments only AFTER the PWA has been performed. The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are: Erythema Edema Erosion Ulceration Vesicles/bullae Excoriations Scabbing The Local Skin Reaction symptoms to be assessed (by the Subject) are: Stinging/burning Pruritus (itch) At Visits 2 -13, the Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs at the each identified common wart site as follows: At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application and At Visits 2 -13, the Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the identi fied common wart site as follows: At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application At visits where NO study medication treatment is performed: Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 51 o Perform an LSR assessment. The Investigator and Subject should report the one integer that best describes the severity of each LSR sign or LSR symptom for the common wart site using the scale below :Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 52 Local Skin Reactions Grade Descriptor 0 None ; No signs or symptoms present. 1 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 2 Moderate ; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; disabling; limiting self-care of activities of daily living. 13.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 and Visit 13 . The following items will be measured: Body temperature ; Heart rate; Respiration rate ; Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes ; Height (at Visit 1 only) ; Weight (at Visit 1 only ); Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant (CS must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins . 13.3. Clinical Laboratory Sampling Non-fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff member at Visit 1 and Visit 13. Approximately 7.5 mL of blood wil l be collected for each chemistry sample and 3 ml of blood will be collected for each complete blood count (CBC). These blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shi pping instructions. The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted: Chemistry Panel Complete Blood Count Albumin Hematocrit Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 53 phosphatase Hemoglobin Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Platelet count Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Red blood cell morphology Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Red blood cell count Bicarbonate White blood cell count Calcium White blood cell differential Chloride % & Total protein Uric acid The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory's standard reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax. The investigator must review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or C S to define the clinical relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report . The investigator must review the Visit 1 laboratory results for all the measured a nalytes for each subject prior to Visit 2. The subject must not be randomized at Visit 2 if any of the Visit 1 results are outside normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S. The investigator must report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, C S as medical history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins . 13.4. Demo graphics and Medical History At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth , race and, if appropriate, ethnicity for each subject. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 54 At Visit 1, the investigator must determine each subject 's Fitzpatrick skin type and document appropriately on the subject's CRF. Table 4: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scoring System Skin Type Classification Description Type I always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; blue eyes; freckles) Type II usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red hair; blue, green, or hazel eyes) Type III sometimes mild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair with any hair or eye color) Type IV burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown) Type V very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown) Type VI Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to darkest brown) (Fitzpatrick, TB, 1988 ) Medical history information will be recorded including all medical conditions and disease states that, at Visit 1: Are ongoing Require concomitant therapy Are, in the opinion of the investigator, relevant to the subject's study participation . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 55 14. ADVERSE EVENTS 14.1. Definitions 14.1.1. Adverse Events (AEs) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical st udy of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study (or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug. Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : intercurrent illnesses ; physical injuries ; events possibly related to concomitant medication ; significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre -existing conditions. (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study should be recorded as an adverse event ); Drug interactions; Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study; laboratory or diagnostic test abnorma lities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or is considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant. N OTE: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be recorded to monitor data from patients who do not meet screening criteria . Worsening of any of the identified common wart assessments should be reported as an AE ONLY if the use of the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or if therapy is required to manage the event . The investigator must, for any common wart related AE, question the subject in detail to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) for any such AE . The investigator should, when certain, report a diag nosis rather than the signs, symptoms or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be reported as medical history, not as an AE . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 56 14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death ; Is life threatening ; Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or Is an important medical event . The term \"life threatening\" refers to an event in which the su bject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in - patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as an additional night stay in the hospital . Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE . Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization . 14.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs starting with the subject's first study medication tr eatment continuing until Visit 11 . Non -serious adverse events that occur between the time the subject was con sented and the first application of study medication will be reported as medical history . Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until Visit 11 (regardless of relationship to study medication). If a subject experiences a SAE after Visit 11 that is deemed by the investigator to be related to study medication, the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report form . 14.1.4. Severity The investigator must define the severity of each AE us ing the following definitions as a guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment. Mild - Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate - Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 57 Severe - Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity . 14.1.5. Relationship to Study Medication The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject's relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by selecting one of the following categories . Related - There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. Not Related - There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE . The term \"reasonab le causal relationship\" means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 14.2. Reporting Procedures 14.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non- directive question such as \"Has there been any change in your health since the previous study visit?\" The Investigator/designee will monitor t he subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit AEs in a similar manner . If appropriate, based on the subject's response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . AEs that are defined as \"Not Related\" to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject's last study visit. AEs that are defined as \"Related\" to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae . 14.2.2. Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not re lated to the study medications, the investigator must: 1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject's safety Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 58 2. Immediately inform Aclaris of the SAE: Serious Adverse Event Facsimile: 484 -324-2359 3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test results) must be faxed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 4. Monitor and document the progre ss of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor agree that t he SAE is satisfactorily resolved. 5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update sent by fax or by e -mail. Comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) . 14.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the invest igator. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional. The investigator must inform the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who a re being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 59 15. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 15.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations Based on efficacy results from study A -101-WART -203 with the same active study medication and treatment plan specified in the current protocol for a comparable patient population and indication, an overall per -wart clearance rate of at least 26% for Active compared with 9% for Vehicle is anticipated. Assuming a distribution of treated warts per subject comparable to the Phase 2 study results, statistical modeling provided a forecast of an advantage in subject responder rates (all treated warts with PWA= 0) for Active over Vehicle groups of at least 11 percentage points. This le ads to a required sample size for the current study of approximately 500 subjects to provide greater than 90% power to achieve statistical significance in the primary efficacy analysis . This projection tak es into account the impact of the anticipated subje ct dropout rate on power for the primary efficacy analysis, based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population and planned missing data imputation procedures. Additionally, a simulation was conducted in a manner that accounted for the distribution of multiple warts, the treatment effect in clearance between the different warts and the correlation in wart clearance among multiple warts. Specific details of the s imulation are described in the SAP. Results of this simulation indicate that data from 500 subjects (250 per group) will provide 97% power to demonstrate the superiority of 45% A -101 topical solution over vehicle for the primary endpoint. 15.2. Analysis of Popu lations The populations used for analyses will be defined as follows: Intent -to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population includes all randomized subjects. Per-Protocol Population (PP): The PP Population includes all subjects who received at least one application of study medication and have no major protocol violations. Safety Population: The Safety population includes all subjects who received at least one application of study medication. 15.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy The ITT population will be used for primary and secondary efficacy analyses and summaries. The ITT population is defined as all subjects randomized to the study and analyzed as randomized. The Per -Protocol (PP) population will be used for sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy analysis an d all secondary efficacy analyses included in the hierarchical testing procedure. Details on all analyses discussed below will be provided in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The primary efficacy analysis will be a treatment compari son of A -101 45% compared to Vehicle at Visit 10 (Day 60). It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts. A Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the baseline number of tre ated warts will be used to perform the primary Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 60 efficacy comparison between treatment groups, with 2- tail alpha set at 0.05. The analysis will be based on the ITT population. Any identified common wart for a randomized subject that has missing data at the endpoint visit will be treated as not Clear for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis. The first sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be an analysis based upon the PP population. This analysis will use the same CMH model described for the primary analysis. A second sensitivity analysis will be conducted for the primary endpoint using the same CMH model for the ITT population that includes the imputation of missing PWA data using a fully conditionally specified (FCS) regression -based Multiple Imputation (MI) procedure . To assess the impact of missing data imputation on the primary analysis results a tipping point analysis will be conducted. This analysis will shift the treatment coefficient in the regression model use d in the MI procedure to impose a worse mean maximum PWA for the A -101 45% arm and a better mean maximum PWA for the vehicle arm. Details of this tipping point analysis will be specified in the SAP. In addition, a model similar to the primary analysis mo del but stratified instead by Study Center will be performed as a sensitivity analysis including a Breslow -Day test to evaluate heterogeneity across sites. Four secondary efficacy analyses will be performed and tested in a hierarchical Fixed -Sequence ste p- down method to control alpha among secondary efficacy variables . The predefined order of the tests is specified to be the order of these analyses as presented below. All analyses will be conducted at the same alpha level ( 2-tail alpha = 0.05). The res ults of the second analysis will only be reported if the first analysis reaches statistical significance at alpha = 0.05. The results of the third analysis will only be reported if the first and second analyses reach statistical significance, each at alph a = 0.05. The results of the fourth analysis will only be reported if the first, second and third analyses reach statistical significance , each at alpha = 0.05. Each of the analys es will focus on the outcome of identified common warts at specified time p oints. The first secondary analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 45% compared to Vehicle at Visit 13 (Day 137). It will be based on the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts. A Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test identical to the primary efficacy analysis model and stratified by the number of treated warts at baseline will be used to perform the comparison between treatment groups, with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05. Any randomized subject wi th missing data at the Day 137 visit will be treated as not Clear for the purpose of this secondary efficacy analysis. Sensitivity analyses specified for the primary efficacy analysis will also be performed for this efficacy time point, including missing d ata imputation impact analyses, the tipping point analysis, and the site heterogeneity analysis. The second secondary efficacy analysis will be based on a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle of the mean per -subject percent of treated warts that are Clear (PWA=0) at Visit 13 (Day 137), using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with 2- tail alpha set at 0.05. The third secondary efficacy analysis will be a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle of the proportion of subjects with a single wa rt at baseline, whose wart is Clear (PWA=0) at Visit 10, using a CMH test stratified by investigator site, with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05 . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 61 The fourth secondary efficacy analysis will a comparison between A -101 45% and Vehicle s with respect to the median time to achieve onset of Clearance (PWA=0) for all treated warts . It will be conducted as a comparison of median time for a subject to first achieve C learance (PWA=0) of all treated warts , using a log rank test with 2 -tail alpha set at 0.05 . This will be a Kaplan -Meier time -to-event analysis providing standard survivor functions and comparisons of time-to-event curves using the log rank test , where time -to-event curves will be compared with two-tail alpha = 0.05, and median time to event will be presented f or each treatment group. For each subject t he time to achieve onset of complete treated wart Clearance will be calculated from the date of randomization to the earliest visit date when all treated warts are clear. In the event a subject does not attain co mplete wart Clearance, that subject's time -to-event data will be treated as censored for the Kaplan -Meier analysis. 15.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the Safety Population and using actual treatment received . The proportion of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class. Vital signs, LSR sco res and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented by study medication. No inferential testing will be performed. Safety summaries by study medication group will include listings by study medication of adverse ev ents incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from pre-application values in vital signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented by study medication showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. The version of MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 15.5. Interim Analysis No interim analyses are planned for this study.

Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IRB /EC, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the study subjects or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 16.2. Protocol Violations A protocol violation is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medication , and/or GCP guidelines . Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF . As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions to protocol -specific entry criteria to allow patients to enter a study. If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligib ility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO. Such subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible I RB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 16.3. Training For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects . It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinator s or other applicable personnel attend this visit. During this visit, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs. Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to participating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study . Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items. Team organization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center . 16.4.

Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -302 Amendment 3: Version 5 14 February 2019 70 Wash your hands prior to co mpleting study medication treatment. Visually inspect the applicator for damage. If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment. Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open wounds. Wear nitrile exam ination gloves during the treatment that were provided to you by your doctor. Latex gloves are prohibited. Thoroughly cleanse the identified common wart by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol that was provided to you by your doctor. Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart, squeeze in the middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the identified common wart . Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, firmly move the applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the lesion. Apply the study medication for approximately 15 seconds. Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin. During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe. Ensure the each identified wart is fully saturated with study medication at the end of the approximately 15 second application. Allow the treated wart to remain undisturbed for approximately 15 seconds. After approximately 15 seconds repeat the approximately 15 second application process. Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to the identified common wart up to 3 times. Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and d ry the treated common wart and the surrounding skin without wiping or rubbing. Document , in your treatment diary, the number of times the identified common wart is treated during a treatment. After applying the study medication, the cap should be put bac k on the applicator, the used applicator should be put in one of the used nitrile gloves (after removal), knotted at the end and placed in a biohazard bag. The biohazard bag, with the used applicator in the glove, should be placed in the plastic bag you br ought the applicator home in, and returned to the site for accountability.
