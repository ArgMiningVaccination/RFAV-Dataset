General Requirements The New Jersey (NJ) Title V Maternal and Child Health ( MCH ) Block Grant Application/Annual Report was developed according to t he seventh edition of the Title V MCH Block Grant to States Application/Annual Report Guidance which consists of two documents: 1) Guidance And Forms For The Title V Application/Annual Report ; and 2) Appendix of Supporting Documents, which includes backgro und program information and other technical resources. As with previous editions, this Guidance adheres to the specific statutory requirements outlined in Sections 501 and 503 -509 of the Title V legislation and promotes the use of evidence -based public he alth practices by states/jurisdictions in developing a Five -Year Action Plan that addresses identified MCH priority needs. The revised Guidance also reaffirms the mission of Title V as \"to improve the health and well-being of all of America's mothers, chil dren, and families.\" 1. D. Table of Contents This report follows the outline of the Table of Contents provided in the \"Guidance And Forms For The Title V Application/Annual Report,\" Omb No: 0915 -0172; expires January 31, 20 20. 2. Logic Model The MCH Block Grant Logic Model which is driven by the state's priority needs, Title V National Outcome Measures, state selected National Performance Measures, State Performance Measures, and state - initiated Evidence -based Strategy Measure is presented in Table 1 - New Jersey Five -Year Needs Assessment Frame work Logic Model on page 30. 3.A. Executive Summary The mission of the Division of Family Health Services (FHS) is to improve the health, safety, and well - being of families and communities in New Jersey (NJ). FHS works to promote and protect the health of mothers, children, adolescents, and at -risk populations, and to reduce disparities in health outcomes by ensuring access to quality compre hensive care. Our ultimate goals are to enhance the quality of life for each person, family, and community, and to make an investment in the health of future generations. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Application and Annual Report that FHS subm its each year to the Maternal Child Health Bureau (MCHB) provides an overview of initiatives, State -supported programs, and other State -based responses designed to address the maternal and child health (MCH) needs in NJ as identified through our continuous needs assessment process and in concert with the Department of Health (NJDOH) strategi c plan, the State Health Improvement Plan, Healthy NJ 2020, and the collaborative process with other MCH partners. NJ is the most urbanized and densely populated state in the nation with 9.0 million residents. It is also one of the most racially and ethnically diverse states in the country. The racial and ethnic mix for NJ mothers, infants, and children is more diverse than the overall population compo sition. This growing diversity not only raises the importance of addressing disparities in health outcomes and improving services to individuals with diverse backgrounds but also of the need to ensure a culturally competen t workforce and service delivery system. Indeed, one of the three priority goals of the FHS Title V program is to increase the delivery of culturally competent services through a well -trained workforce . The other two goals are to improve access to health s ervices through partnerships and collaboration and to reduce disparities in health outcomes across the lifespan consistent with the Life Course Perspective (LCP). The goals and State Priority Needs (SPNs) selected by FHS are consistent with the findings of the Five - Year Needs Assessment, built upon the work of prior MCH Block Grant Applications/Annual Reports and in alignment with NJDOH's and FHS' goals and objectives. These are (1) Increasing Healthy Births, (2) NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 4 Improving Nutrition and Physical Activity, (3) Reducing Black Infant Mortality , (4) Promoting Youth Development, (5) Improving Access to Quality Care for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs ( CYSHCN ), (6) Reducing Teen Pregnancy, (7) Improving & Integrating Information Systems, and (8) Smoking Prevention. Title V services within FHS will continue to support enabling services, population -based preventive services, and infrastructure building to meet the health of all NJ's families. Based on NJ's eight selected SPNs as identified in th e Five -Year Needs Assessment, NJ has selected the following ten of 15 possible National Performance Measures (NPMs) for programmatic emphasis over the next five -year reporting period: NPM NPM Medical Visit Medical Home, NPM #12 Transitioning to Adulthood, NPM #13 Oral Health, and NPM #14 Household Smoking. During a period of economic hardship and federal funding uncertainty, challenges persist in promoting access to services, reducing racial and ethnic disparities , and improving cultural competency of health care providers and culturally appropriate services . Thus evaluating existing programs to ascertain effectiveness is also a top priority for the FHS. Although the overall infant mortality rate in New Jersey is lower than the national rate (4. 8 per 1,000 live births versus 5.9 per 1,000 live births in 201 5), the disparity between White, non-Hispanic ( NH), and Black, NH, is significant. The infant mortality rate for Black, NH, is more than three times that of White, NH, and this disparity has remained constant for at least ten years. Additionally, dispariti es are seen between New Jersey counties and municipalities in terms of b lack infant m ortality rates and other health outcomes . Counties such as Atlantic, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Mercer, and Passaic have black infant mortality rates ranging from 6.5 per 1,000 births to 17.1 per 1,000 births. Further investigation within these counties showed that certain municipalities were really driving these high county rates and therefore, a specific focus on municipalities is necessary to address disparities. In an attempt to identify some of the root causes of this issue, three (3) regional focus groups were performed with key stakeholders. These focus groups helped identify some of the social determinants of health (SDOH) that contribute to the persisting di sparities. As a result, the Healthy Women, Healthy Families (HWHF) Initiative (formerly the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes - IPO - initiative) will change its focus to address the high black infant mortality rat es that persist in New Jersey. HWHF grants will be awarded in fiscal year 2019 (start date of July 1, 2018) through a request for proposals process. The goal of this initiative is to improve maternal and infant health outcomes for women of childbearing age (defined by CDC as 15 -44 years of age) and their families, especially Black families, through a collaborative and coordinated community -driven approach. This will be done using a two -pronged approach: 1) county level activities that will focus on providing high -risk families and/or wom en of childbearing age access to resource information and referrals to local community services that promote ch ild and family wellness and 2) Black Infant Mortality (BIM) municipality level activities that will focus on Black NH women of child -bearing age by facilitating community linkages and supports, implementing specific BIM programs, and providing education and outreach to health providers, social service providers and other community level stakeholders. New Jersey is taking a targeted approach to reducing BIM rates through the enhancement of existing programs and creating new programs with the emphasi s on this priority population. New Jersey recognizes the importance of a statewide collaboration of existing and non -traditional partners to address the SDOH which will be instrumental in moving the needle on Black Infant Mortality reduction. As a result, partners from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Division of Community Affairs, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 5 Department of Education, Department of Transportation, t he Office of the Attorney General and the Community will strategically coll aborate to reduce Black Infant m ortality. FHS will be working very closely with NJDOH Office of Population Health and has created an FHS -Population Health Team (FHS -PHT) with the pu rpose of (a) ensuring health in all policies, (b) leverag ing resources and inter - and intra - departmental collaborations , and, (c) a ddressing he alth disparities using a multi -sectorial approach . The HWHF Initiative will continue to expand outreach and incr ease referrals to community -based MCH services. Outreach is a major component for the Community Health Workers. They are the boots on the ground, trusted members of the community that provide services in a culturally and linguistically competent manner . For FY17 the total number of outreach contacts were 73,303. Of those 73,303 contacts, 17,208 Community Health Screens were completed for referral to Central Intake Hubs . Additionally, HWHF will require Community Health Workers to provide case management and more intensive follow ups. The HWHF initiative also has a heavy focus on the use of metrics that will guide the grantees to be more outcomes -focused in their activities. Another program promoting the L ife Course Perspective and augmenting our efforts to reduce infant mortality , pre-term births , and maternal morbidity is the Maternal and Infant Early Child Home Visiting (MIECHV ) Program which has expanded Home Visiting (HV) across all 21 NJ counties with 7,041 families participating in HV during SFY 2017. The goal of the NJ MIECHV Program is to expand NJ's existing system of home visiting services which provides evidence -based family support services to: improve family functioning; prevent child abuse and neglect; and promote child health, safety, develop ment and school readiness. Other initiatives that are contributing towards positive outcomes in addressing the state priority areas of reducing teen pregnancy; promoting youth development and improving physical activity and nutrition are the Whole School , Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) School Health NJ Project, the NJ Personal Responsibility Ed ucation Program (PREP) , and the NJ Abstinence Education Program (AEP) . To address the obesity epidemic, the ShapingNJ Partnership continues to grow, and currently boasts more than 320 organizations that have signed a formal agreement with ShapingNJ, committing to work to implement 10 obesity prevention strategies throughout the state. To improve access to health services, the NJDOH has provided reimbursement for uninsured primary medical and dental health encounters through the designated Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). In SFY 2019 the State is proposing funding of the FQHCs wit h $30 million to continue to focus on the needs of the uninsured and particularly those residents not eligible for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and/or NJ FamilyCare under Medicaid Expansion who need access to care and meet eligibili ty requirements. In the area of children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), the Newborn Screening and Genetic Services (NSGS) Program is helping to ensure that all newborns and families affected by an abnormal screening result receive time ly and appropriate follow -up services. NJ newborns currently receive screening for 55 disorders. In May 2018, screening for six lysosomal storage disorders will be implemented which bring s the total number of disorders NJ screens newborns for to 61. NJ remains among the leading states in offering the most screenings for newborns. In addition to disorders detected through heel -stick, NJ's newborns are also screened with pulse oximetry through the Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD) screen ing program. As of April 2018, NJDOH has received reports of 27 infants with previously unsuspected CCHDs detected through the screening program. Given the high rates of autism reported in NJ, FHS implemented the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS) in 2009. BDARS is a tool for surveillance, needs assessment, service planning, research, and most importantly for linking families to services. The BDARS, at present, refers all living children and their families to the Special Child Health Services Case Mana gement Units (SCHS CMUs), which are within the Family Centered Care Services (FCCS) Program. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 6 The FCCS program promotes access to care through early identification, referral to community -based culturally competent services and follow -up for CYSHCN age bi rth to 21 years of age. Ultimately, services and supports provided through SCHS CMUs, Family WRAP (Wisdom, Resources, and Parent to Parent), and Specialized Pediatric Services Providers (SPSP) via Child Evaluation Centers (CECs), Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofac ial, and Tertiary Care Services are constructs that support NJ's efforts to address the six MCH Core Outcomes for CYSHCN. This safety net is supported by State and Title V funds administered via community health service grants, local support by the County Boards of Chosen Freeholders, reimbursement for direct service provision, and technical assistance to grantees. Through our Title V program partners, FHS continues to address families' social conditions by providing, in addition to quality health care, ref errals to support services such as : public health insurance options ; legal services ; food stamps ; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); employment and public assistance. These are critically important to improve health outcomes and decrease the need for drugs or other medical interventions, improve quality, and reduce costs. In 201 7, CMU staffs continued to build upon a quality improvement (QI) initiative initially launched in 2014 to enhance consistency in documentation within individual service plans across the SCHS CMUs, and to improve upon the Case Management Referral System's (CMRS) data gathering capability. Information garnered from this initiative is anticipated to enhance N J's efforts to improve performance on the Six Core Outcomes for CYSHCN, as well as targeted improvement in CMRS documentation in the following two areas; transition to adulthood and access to a medical home. The 2014 findings were used as a baseline to com pare with NJ and the nation's performance as reported on the National Survey, and comparison data is collected annually, beginning in 2015 . Results are discussed in Plan for the Application Year - NPM #11 and NPM #12. The reorganization of State services and supports for CYSHCN by our intergovernmental partners provided an opportunity to realign pathways for families and providers to access a continuum of care across the lifespan. Concurrently, the Affordable Care Act's assurances pose challenges as well as benefits for families with CYSHCN to maintain and optimize access to community -based care. These exciting changes are anticipated to broaden health insurance access. NJ's Title V CYSHCN program diligently collaborates with intergovernmental and communit y-based partners to ensure that care through these multiple systems will be coordinated, family centered, community -based, and culturally competent. Communication across State agencies and timely training for State staffs, community -based organizations and families with CYSHCN remains a priority to ensure that families are adequately supported during the reorganization of these systems. Additionally, family and youth input on multi -system access to care is obtained through the Community of Care Consortium, a coalition led by Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, a key partner to NJ's Title V program and comprised of parents of CYSHCN and youth, State agency representatives, and community - based organizations. In 2015, t he Department received a 2 -year $300,000 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA ) State Implementation Grant for Enhancing the System of Services for CYSHCN through Systems Integration D -70 grant opportunity. This project enhance d NJ's capacity to improve upon the proportion of CYSCHN who receive integrated care through a patient -centered medical home. Working in collaboration with community partners including the NJ Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (NJ AAP), the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN) who recently changed their name to SPAN Parent Advocacy Network , three SCHS CMUs, NJ Medicaid and others, this initiative addresse d access to a medical home through collaborative partnerships across agencies, organizations and programs, and the development of policy and progr ams to ensure CYSHCN receive the comprehensive services and supports needed . As part of the over -arching goals of the project the partnerships foster ed (1) development of a shared resource, (2) integration of care for CYSHCN with the goal of working toward s creating a comprehensive system of care for CYSHCN, and (3) a strategy to improve cross -system care coordination. At project end in 2017, the initiative yielded a comprehensive shared plan of care, continuing education webinar's targeting professionals a nd families, improved the mechanism to record documentation within the existing Case Management Referral System (CMRS) and created a medical home website . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 7 . In 2017, NJ Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program (EHDI ), FCC S and the NJ American Acade my of Pediatrics (NJ AAP) successfully completed a 12 -month pediatric hearing loss outreach initiative. The \"Ask Audrey O'Gram\" project was a free, monthly, online self -study initiative that focused on increasing stakeholder awareness of various topics rela ted to children with hearing loss. SCHS CMUs were surveyed to determine baseline knowledge, and were provided with monthly topical overviews, hypothetical case -studies, available statewide and national supports and services, and a relevant pediatric hearin g loss question. On average, 59% of CMs participated in the monthly modules. A comparison of pre - and post -test surveys revealed statistically significant improvements in knowledge (P=0.0013) related to the topics addressed throughout this initiative. Modu le topics and project findings will be reviewed with SCHS CMs at a June 2018 Quarterly Case Management Meeting. A poster presentation detailing this initiative was recognized with the \"Outstanding Poster Award - EHDI Workforce Issues\" at the 17th Annual Ea rly Hearing Detection & Intervention (EHDI) Meeting in Denver, Colorado in March 2018, marking NJ's first poster award for this national conference. This educational initiative helped promote progress towards NJ's achievement of the 6 MCH core outcomes for CYSHCN, and information gained showed the usefulness of this educational format for further collaborative educational outreach to our stakeholders. In sum, NJ is actively working on ways to improve outcomes while simultaneously celebrating some already a chieved improvements, to the benefit of the women and children served as a result of the strong partnership between the State and the MCH Bureau. 3.B. Overview of the State The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Application and Annual Report, submitted annually to the Maternal Child Health Bureau (MCHB), provides an overview of initiatives, State -supported programs, and other State -based responses designed to address the maternal and child hea lth (MCH) needs in New Jersey. The Division of Family Health Services (FHS) in the NJ Department of Health (NJDOH), Public Health Services B ranch posts a draft of the MCH Block Grant Application and Annual Report narrative to its website in the second quarter of each calendar year to receive feedback from the maternal and child health community. The mission of the Division of Family Health Services (FHS) is to improve the health, safety, and well - being of families and communities in NJ. The Division works to promote and protect the health of mothers, children, adolescents, and at -risk populations, and to reduce disparities in health outcomes by ensuring access to quality comprehensive care. Our ultimate goals are to enhance the quality of life for each person, family, and community, and to make an investment in the health of future g enerations. A brief overview of NJ demographics is included to provide a background for the maternal and ch ild health needs of the State. While NJ is the most urbanized and densely populated state in the nation with 9.0 million residents, it has no single very large city. Only six municipalities hav e more than 100,000 residents. NJ is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse states in the country. According to the 2016 New Jersey Population Estimates , 55.8% of the population was white, non -Hispanic, 15.0% was black, 9. 8% was Asian, 0.6% was American Indian and Alaska Native, and 2.2% reported two or more races. In terms of ethnicity, 20.0% of the population was Hispanic. The racial and ethnic mix for NJ mothers, infants, and children is more diverse than the overall population composition . According to 201 6 birth certificate data , 27.1% of mothers delivering infants in NJ were Hispanic, 44.3% were white non -Hispanic, 13.3% we re black non -Hispanic, and 11.7% were Asian or Pacific Islanders non-Hispanic. The growing diversity of NJ's maternal and child population raises the importance of addressing disparities in health outcomes and improving services to individuals with diverse backgrounds. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 8 MCH priorities continu e to be a focus for the NJDOH. The Division of FHS, the Title V agency in NJ, has identified 1) improving access to health services thru partnerships and collaboration , 2) reducing disparities in health outcomes across the life span, and 3) increasing cultural competency of services as three priority goals for the MCH population. These goals are consistent with the Life Course Perspective (LCP) which proposes that an inter -related web of social, economic, environmental, and physiological factors contribute in varying degrees through the course of a person's life and across generations, to good health and well -being. Social determinants of health (SDOH), which are the conditio ns in the environments in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age, have a significant effect on health, fun ctioning, and quality of life. Healthy People 2020 identifies five key areas of SDOH as economic stability, education, social and comm unity context, health and health care, and neighborhood and built environment. I n consideration of SDOH, there is a heightened need for integrating both health and non -health partners, as well as state, and external partners in addressing infant, maternal mortality, the opioid crisis and other public health issues facing NJ. The selection of the NJ's eight State P riority Needs is a product of FHS's continuous needs assessment . Influenced by the MCH Block Grant needs assessment process , the NJDOH budget pro cess, the New Jersey State Health Assessment Plan , Healthy New Jersey 2020 , Community Health Improvement Plans and the collaborative process with other MCH partners, FHS has selected the following State Priority Needs (see Section I I.C. State Selected Priorities): #1) Increasing Healthy Births , #2) Improving Nutrition & Physical Activity, #3) Reducing Black Infant Mortality , #4) Promoting Youth Development, #5) Improving Access to Quality Care for CYSHCN, #6) Reducing Teen Pregnancy, #7) Improving & Integrating Information Systems, and #8) Smoking Prevention. These goals and State Priority Needs (SPNs) are consistent with the findings of the Five -Year Needs Assessment and are built upon the work of prior MCH Block Grant Applications/Annual reports. Consistent with federal guidelines from the MCH Bureau, Title V services within FHS will continue to suppor t enabling services, population -based preventive services, and infrastructure services to meet the health of all NJ's families. During a period of economic hardship and federal funding uncertainty, challenges persist in promoting access to services, reduci ng racial and ethnic disparities , and improving cultural competency of health care providers and culturally appropriate services . Based on NJ's eight selected SPNs as identified in the Five -Year Needs Assessment, NJ has selected the following ten of 15 p ossible National Performance Measures (NPMs) for programmatic emphasis over the next five -year reporting period: NPM NPM NPM #12 Transition Oral Health , and NPM #14 Household Smoking . State Performance Measures (SPM) have been reassessed through the needs assessment process. Five existing SPM s will be kept, and two old SPM s will be deleted. The existing SPM s which will be continued are: SPM #1 Black -Hispanic Preterm Infants in NJ, hildren with Elevated Blood Lead Levels , SPM #3 Hearing Screening Follow -up, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 9 SPM #4 Referral from BDARS to Case Management Unit, and SPM #5 Age of Initial Autism Diagnosis The old SPM s to be discontinued and replaced are: Regional MCH Consortia Implementing Community - based Fetal Infant Mortality Review ( FIMR ) Teams and Overweight High School Students. Table 1 - Title V MCH Block Grant Five -Year Needs Assessment Framework Logic Model (See Supporting Document #1) summarizes the selected ten NPMs and aligns the impact of Evidence -Based Informed Strategy Measures (ESMs) on NPMs and Nat ional Outcome Measures (NOMs). The purpose of the ESMs is to identify state Title V program efforts which can contribute to improved performance relative to the selected NPMs. The Logic Model is o rganized with one NPM per row. The Logic Model is the key representation which summarizes the Five -Year Needs Assessment process and includes the three -tiered performance measureme nt system with Evidence -Based or Informed Strategy Measures (ESM), National Performance Measures (NPM), and Nat ional Outcome Measures (NOMs). The Logic Model represents a more integrated system created by the three -tiered performance measure framework whic h ties the ESMs to the NPMs which in turn influence the NOMs. The following is a brief overview of MCH services to put into context the Title V program within the State's health care delivery environment. Healthy Women Healthy Families (HWHF) grants will be awarded in fiscal year 2019 (start date of July 1, 2018) through a request for proposals process. The goal of this initiative is to improve maternal and infant health outcomes for women of childbearing age (defined by CDC as 15 -44 years of age) and the ir families, especially Black families, through a collaborative and coordinated community -driven approach. This will be done usin g a two -pronged approach: 1) county level activities that will focus on providing high -risk families and/or women of childbeari ng age access to resource information and referrals to local community services that promote ch ild and family wellness and 2) Black Infant Mortality (BIM) municipality level activities that will focus on Black NH women of child - bearing age by facilitating community linkages and supports, implementing specific BIM programs, and providing education and outreach to health providers, social service providers and other community level stakeholders. Using two models, Central Intake Hubs (CIH) and Community Health Workers (CHW), the HWHF Initiative will work to improve maternal and infant health outcomes including preconception care, prenatal care, interconceptual care, preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality through implementation of evidence -based a nd best practice strategies across three key life course stages: preconception, prenatal/postpartum and interconception. Central Intake Hubs (CIH) are a single point of entry for screening and referral of women of reproductive age and their families to ne cessar y medical and social services. The Community Health Worker (CHW) model performs outreach and client recruitment within the targeted community to identify and enroll women and their families in appropriate programs and services. CIHs work closely with community providers and partners, including CHWs, to eliminate dupli cation of effort and services. Standardized screening tools are used and referrals to programs and services are tracked in a centralized web -based system (SPECT - Single Point of Entry an d Client Tracking). New Jersey is taking a targeted approach to reducing BIM rates through the enhancement of existing programs and creating new programs with the emphasi s on this priority population. New Jersey recognizes the importance of a statewide co llaboration of existing and non -traditional partners to address the SDOH which will be instrumental in moving the needle on Black Infant Mortality reduction. As a result, partners from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Division of Community Affairs, Department of Education, Department of Transportation, the Office of the Attorney General and the Community will strategically coll aborate to reduce Black Infant m ortality. FHS will be working very closely with NJDOH Office of Population Health and has created an FHS -Population Health Team (FHS -PHT) with the purpose of (a) ensuring health in all polici es, (b) Leverage resources and inter - and intra - departmental collaborations , and, (c) a ddressing he alth disparities using a multi -sectorial approach . Another program promoting the Life Course Perspective is the Maternal and Infant Early Child Home Visitin g (MIECHV ) Program which has expanded Home Visiting across a ll 21 NJ counties with 7,041 families participating in HV during SFY 2017 (7/1/2016 to 6/30/ 2017). The goal of the NJ MIECHV NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 10 Program is to expand NJ's existing system of home visiting services which provides evidence -based family support services to: improve family functioning; prevent child abuse and neglect; and promote child health, safety, development and school readiness. Full implementation of the NJ MIECHV Program is being carried out in collaboration with the Department of Children and Families (DCF ) and is promoting a system of care of early childhood (see Support Document #5) . NJ is a FY201 7 recipient of both a federal MIECHV Formula and Competitive grant. In January 2017, NJ was awarded a MIECHV Innovation Grant to implement and evaluate a training strategy for Home Visitors called Goal Plan Strategy (GPS) in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene . The Child and Adolescent Health Program (CAHP) successfully applied in 2010 for two new federal grants to prevent teen pregnanc y and promote youth development - the Personal Resp onsibilit y Education Program (PREP) and t he Absti nence Education Program (AEP). In February of 2018, the NJDOH was awarded continuing funding for federal fiscal year 2018 and 2019 for PREP. AEP funding ends 9/30/18 and will be replaced by the Sexual Risk A voidance Education (SRAE) Grant Program . NJ anticipates receiving the grant award in early April of 2018 . As of March 2018, all program positions for both PREP and AEP have been filled. In addition, CAHP now has a Coordinator to provide overall direction a nd collaboration amongst PREP, AEP and School Health grantees. The new SRAE program will build upon the NJ Abstinence Education Program (NJ AEP) and will enable the state to continue implementing evidence -informed curricula to help youth abstain or delay sexual activity, to reduce pregnancy and Sexual ly Transmitted Diseases ( STDs )/Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and, where appropriate, to provide options that may include mentoring, counseling and/or adult supervision . NJ AEP has followed an SRAE app roach for the past 4 years because it is a public health approach to sexual health education complimentary to the PREP program which provides significant education on Sexual Risk Reeduca tion in addition to avoidance. In the S ummer of 2018 a full RFA will b e released by NJDOH and new grantees will be selected for a two -year grant cycle. The NJ SRAE Program will provide medically accurate Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Questioning (LGBTIQ ) inclusive and trauma informed sexual healt h education to teens aged 10 -14. PREP is a school - and community -based comprehensive sexual health education program th at replicates evidence -based, medically accurate programs proven effective in reducing initial and repeat pregn ancies among teens aged 14 -19. Beginning in SFY18 NJ PRE P will implement programing in high s chools only . NJ PREP also seeks to help teens avoid and reduce high risk sexual behaviors through the promotion of abstinence, refusal skills, use of condoms and other forms of birth control . NJ PREP provides education on the following adult preparation subjects: Healthy Relationships, Parent/Child Communication and Adolescent Health. NJ PREP has responded to the invitation to accept funds for program continuation through September 30, 2020 a nd that will allow the implementation of programs to transfer over to only implementing in high s chools and no longer in middle s chools. In the current funding cycle, the state will continue to build on the success of the last six years by supporting three evidence -based models (EBM), two of which, The Teen Outreach Program (TOP \u00ae) and Reducing the Risk were selected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's(CDC) Evidence -based Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program List. In addition, CAHP will add the NJ based peer education program, Teen PEP , to the PREP Program beginning 10/1/18. NJ's AYAH -CoIIN (Adolescent and Young Adult Health -Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network ) funded through the National Resource Center (NRC) and AMCHP will begin an FQHC pilot to improve adolescent well visit rates and adolescent friendliness of the clinic. In January of 2017, data from a NJ FQHC report identified a greater than 50% disparity for adol escent preventive medical visit rates at FQHCs (averaging about 45% during the years of 2013 -2015) as compared to private physician offices (averaging about 97%). The goal of the NJ AYAH CoIIN is to increase the FQHC adolescent visit rate to achieve the Heal thy People 2020 goal of 75.6%. To build up to the FQHC p ilot, NJ's AYAH -CoIIN has spent significant time addressing the issue of youth engagement in health . To accomplish our mission, NJ has hired a young adult to work part -time (summer and winter breaks) in the CAHP, we have provided several trainings on creat ing effective youth adult partnerships, mentoring, and will host a youth leaders hip camp in the summer of 2018. In addition, NJ has completed a survey of over 100 college students and focus groups with 60 adolescents to collect information on the perceptio n of well NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 11 visits/preventative care of adolescents and young adults. The official project will end August 31, 2018 and data from the activities wil l be shared. NJ is committed to continuing the work of the AYAH -CoIIN in partnership with stakeholders such as NJAAP . To address the obesity epidemic, the ShapingNJ Partnership continues to grow, and currently boasts more than 230 organizations that have signed a formal agreement with ShapingNJ, committing to work to implement 10 obesity prevention strategies throughout the state. The goal of the ShapingNJ Partnership is to prevent obesity and improve the health of populations that are at risk for poor health outcomes in NJ by making \"the hea lthy choice, the easy choice.\" The ShapingNJ website reaches consumers as well as professionals and partners with the latest research, information and best practices, as well as toolkits for improving health in each of the 6 settings where New Jerseyans live, work and play: child care centers, schools, communities, worksites and businesses, and healthcare settings . To improve access to health services, the NJDOH has provided reimbursement for uninsured primary medical and dental health encounters through the designated Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) since 1992 under the FQHC -Uncompensated Care Fund . In SFY 2017, the FQHC - Uncompensated Care F und was funded at $28 million. In SFY2017, the F QHCs served a total of 180,303 uninsured/underinsured residents and 490,420 uninsured/underinsured visits were reimbursed . In SFY 2018, the FQHC -Uncompensated Care Fund was funded at $30 million. In the area of children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), the Newborn Screening and Genetic Services Program (NSGS) helps to ensure that all newborns and families affected by an abnormal screening result will receive timely and a ppropriate follow -up services. In terms of newborn screening for diso rders detectable via the heelstick, all newborns receive screening for 55 disorders. In May 2018, screening for six lysosomal storage disorders including Krabb e, Pompe, Neimann Pick, Fabry, Gaucher, and mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), will be implemented. Follow -up services include notification and communication with parents, primary care physicians, pediatric specialists and others to ensure the baby has immediate access to confi rmatory testing and treatment. NJ remains among the leading states in offerin g the most screenings for newborns . NSGS meets and communicates regularly with several advisory panels composed of parents, physicians, specialists, and others to ensure NJ's program is state -of-the-art in terms of screening technologies and operations a nd it is responsive to any current concerns regarding newborn screening. Legislation mandating newborn pulse oximetry screening to detect Critical Congenital Heart Defects (CCHD) t ook effect on August 31, 2011. The inclusion of pulse ox screening questi ons in the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System enable the capability to track indiv idual level screening results. In addition, information on all infants with failed screens is reported by each birthing facility to the Birth Defects Registry via the Pulse Oxime try Module. As of April 2018 , NJDOH ha d received reports of 27 infants with previously unsuspected critical congenital heart defects detected through the screening program. In 2012, NJ was one of six states awarded a 3 -year HRSA grant for CCHD S creening . This demonstration grant enabled funding to contract with the NJ Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (NJAAP ) for hiring program staff, the development of resource materials, comprehensive educational offerings and support for an evaluat ion of CCHD screening in the neonat al intensive care unit (NICU). An article describing the collaborative work and lessons learned of the HRSA grantees was published in the Maternal Child H ealth Journal in January 2017. Since 2016, the CCHD Screening progr am is funded with State aid and collaboration with the NJAAP continues to implement program activities and provide technical assistance to birthing facilities. Although most states now have mandates or administrative rules requiring screening of newborns f or CCHD, many questions remain about effective implementation of screening including scre ening for infants in the NICU. In 2015, NJDOH partnered with the NJ NICU Collaborative to lead a multi -state evaluation of CCHD screening in the NICU. Twenty -one NICUs in five states (CA, IL, MN, NJ, NY) p articipated in the evaluation. Results from this evaluation have been presented at scientific meetings adding valuable contributions to the national discussion and providing further specification to guide CCHD screenin g in NJ. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 12 The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program (EHDI) monitors compliance with the NJ universal newborn hearing screening law, and measures NJ's progress in achieving the national EHDI goals of ensuring that all infants receive a hearing sc reening by one month of age, that children who do not pass screening receive diagnostic testing by three months of age, and that children who are diagnosed with hearing loss receive family -centered, culturally competent Early Intervention Services by six m onths of age. Hospitals have been very successful in ensuring that newborns receive hearing screening prior to hospital discharge, ensuring that children who did not pass their initial screening receive timely and appropriate follow -up remains an area for continued efforts. The NJ EHDI Program is working with hospitals, audiologists and physicians to identify \"small tests of change\" to identify successful strategies for improving outpatient follow -up rates for infants that did not pass initial screening. NJ continues to have one of the highest rates of autism in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2014 prevalence figures published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) on April 27,2018, cited N J as having the highest prevalence rate of 29.3 per 1,000, or approximately one in 34 based on studies from four counties in NJ (Union, Hudson, Essex, and Ocean). The Governor's Council for Medical Research and Treatment of Autism (the Council) is in the Office of the Commissioner at NJDOH; the Council has 14 members and is legislatively mandated . The Council's Vision is to enhance the lives of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) across their lifespans. The Mission of the Council is to advance and disseminate the understanding, treatment, and management of ASD by means of a coordinated program of biomedical research, clinical innovation, and professional training in NJ. In 2012, the Council established a New Jersey Autism Center of Excellence (NJACE). The NJACE consists of a Coordinating Center, Clinical Research Program Sites, and multiple clinical and basic science Research Pilot Projects, in cluding 3 Medical Home Pilots. The NJ ACE Coordinating Center provides common management and support fun ctions to unify the NJ ACE Clinical Research Program Sites and Pilot Project grantees, increas e efficiency and reduce costs. The Coordinating Center grant was awarded to Montclair State University. The NJ ACE Program Site and Pilot Project grantees develop and conduct clinical research projects with the potential to improve the physical and/or behavioral health and well -being of individuals with ASD. The Council is particularly interested in projects with potential direct clinical impact and those that addr ess issues across the lifespan . On July 1, 2009, the Early Identification and Monitoring (EIM) Program implemented the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS). BDARS is an invaluable tool for surveillance, needs assessment, service planning, re search, and most importantly fo r linking families to services. NJ has the oldest requirement in the nation for the reporting of birth de fects, starting in 1928. Since 1985, NJ has maintained a population -based birth defects registry of children with all de fects. Starting in 2003, the Registry received a CDC cooperative agreement for the implementation of a web -based data reporting and tr acking system. In 2007, NJ passed legislation mandating the reporting of autism . Subsequently, with the adoption of legisl ative rules in September 2009, the Registry added the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as reportable diagnoses and the Registry was renamed the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS), expanded the mandatory reporting age for children diagnosed wi th birth defects to age 6, and added severe hyperbilirubinemia as a reportable condition if th e level is 25mg/dl or greater. The BDARS, at present, electronically refers all living children and their families to the Special Child Health Services Case Management Units (SCHS CMUs), which are within the Family Centered Care Services Program (FCCS) . NJ has been very successful in linking children registered with the BDARS with services offered throu gh the county -based SCHS CMUs. However, the system did not further track children and families to determine if and what services were offered to a ny of the registered children. Added in 2012, the Case Management Referral System (CMRS) is used by the CMUs to track and monitor services provided to the children a nd their families. It electronically notifies a CMU when a child living in their county has been registered and referred to their unit. Included in CMRS is the ability to create and modify an Individual Service Plan (ISP), track services, create a record o f each contact with the child and child's family, create standardized reports, and register previously unregistered children. In 2016, efforts were coordinated through the Integrated Systems Medical Grant to enhance SCHS CMUs' reporting via CMRS regarding NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 13 CYSHCN's linkage to a medical hom e and transition to adulthood. Three SCHS CMUs collaborated in development of fields and to pilo t edits in CMRS documentation. Training of the documentation changes was presented in 201 6 and 2017 to all 21 SCHS CMUs. There is ongoing discussion regarding regionalized train the trainer initiatives follow ing the Medical Home Grant closeout. CMRS was successfully adopted by all 21 c ounties and is live statewide. It provides the State Title V program with the opportunity for de sktop review , referral, and linkage to care. As existing cases are migrated to CMRS, and newly referred cases are entered into the database, it is anticipated that trends in access to care and outcomes will be more m easurable and readily tracked. R econfigu ring data reporting and tracking systems, as well as training and retraining State and community -based agencies, while keeping the needs of CYSHCN and their families center to our mission is our challenge. The Family Centered Care Services (FCCS) program promotes access to care through early identification, referral to community -based culturally competent services and follow -up for C YSHCN age birth to 21 years of age. Ultimately, services and supports provided through Special Child Health Services Case Man agement Units (SCHS CMUs), Family WRAP (Wisdom, Resources, and Parent to Parent), and Specialized Pediatric Services Providers (SPSP) via Child Evaluation Centers (CECs), Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial, and Tertiary Care Services are constructs that support NJ's efforts to address the six MCH Core Outcomes for CYSHCN. This safety net is supported by State and federal funds administered via community health services grants, local support by the County Boards of Chosen Freeholders, reimbursement for direct ser vice provision, and tec hnical assistance to grantees. Likewise, intergovernmental and interagency collaboration is ongoing among federal, State and community partners and families; i.e., Social Security Administration; NJ State Departments of Human Service s' NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid programs, Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, Children and Families, Labor, Banking and Insurance, Boggs Center/Association of University Centers on Disabilities, NJ Council on Developmental Disabilities, and community -based organizations such as the NJAAP, NJ Hospital Association, and disability specific organizations such as the Arc of NJ, and the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN) who recently changed their name to SPAN Parent Advocacy Network and the Commun ity of Care Consortium (COCC). Consultation and collaboration with NJDOH programs such as the Birth Defects and Autism Registry, Early Intervention System, the Ryan White Family Centered HIV Care Network, Maternal Child Health, Special Supplemental Nutrition Pr ogram for Women, Infants and Children, Primary Care/Federally Qualified Health Centers, and HIV/AIDS, STD, and Tuberculosis, as well as Public Health Infrastructure, Laboratories, and Emergency Preparedness affords FCCS with opportunities to communicate an d partner in supporting CYSHCN and their families. One example of this collaboration was having the State Director, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services , Department of Labor and Workforce Development speak to SCHS CMU about \" Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; major changes for the public VR .\" Furthermore, the transition of CYSHCN formerly enrolled in the Community Resources for Persons with Disabilities waiver and newly identified underinsured CYSHCN into Managed Long Term Services and Supports, and the referral of uninsured transition aged yo uth into Medicaid expansion or the Marketplace are accomplished through interagency collaboration and linkage with resources across agencies and systems. NJ remains successful in linking children registered with the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting Syst em (BDARS) with services offered through the SCHS CMUs; CECs including the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Spectrum Disorders (FAS/FASD) Centers; Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Centers; Tertiary Care Centers; and Family WRAP. With CDC Surveillance grant funding, the system is undergoing enhancements to support tracking of CYSHCN referred to SCHS CM, and monitoring of services offered and/or provided to determine client outcomes. In 2014, State Case Management staffs launched a quality improvement pr oject to enhance consistency in documentation within CMRS across the SCHS CMUs, and to improve upon CMRS's data gathering capability. Efforts are ongoing, with FCCS staff presenting QI findings to SCHS CMUs on a quarterly basis, since June 2015. SCHS CMU f eedback in turn is incorporated into subsequent CMRS guidance and technical assistance. Information garnered from this initiative is anticipated to enhance NJ's efforts to improve performance on the six core MCHB outcomes for CYSHCN. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 14 The reorganization of State services and supports for CYSHCN by intergovernmental partners; Department of Human Services; Division of Medicaid and Health Services (DMAHS) and Division of Developmental Disabilities; the Department of Children and Families' Divisions of Children 's System of Care and Division of Family and Community Partnerships, and the Department of Health's Division of Aging and Community Services realigned pathways for families and providers to access a continuu m of care across the lifespan. Concurrently, the Affordable Care Act's assurances pose challenges and benefits for families with CYSHCN to maintain and optimize a ccess to community -based care. Title V is collaborating with DMAHS in its comprehensive evaluation and revision to its data administration syst em that will support NJ's efforts to optimally address Federal mandates including the Health Information Technology (HIT) Health Information Exchange (HIE) requirements, the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) transaction and code sets, International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD -10), and the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA.) These exciting changes are anticipated to broaden health insurance access, and to improve cross systems collaboration on implementation of the Asthma/Cystic Fibrosis component of the Fee for Service program. NJ's Title V CYSHCN program diligently collaborates with intergovernmental and community - based partners to ensure that care through these multiple systems will be coordinated, family centered, community -based, and culturally competent. Communication across State agencies and timely training for State staffs, community -based organizations and families with CYSHCN remains key to ensuring that families are adequately supported during the reorganization of these systems. In addition to the health care system changes described above, in 2012 the extremely dangerous and damaging Superstorm Sandy (SSS) affected NJ CYSHCN and their families. Significa nt recovery has been achieved. However, its catastrophic effects challenged our State's infrastructure and ability to maintain an integrated safety net of providers, mobilize and share resources, as well as to support evacuation, relo cation and long -term r ecovery. It also provided opportunities for the Title V program to promote resiliency for CYSHCN and their families by providing information, training, referral and supports to families, as well as technical support to colleagues in federal, State and loca l agencies. Through June 30, 2015, SCHS CMUs provided enhanced capacity case management for Sandy -impacted families of CYSHCN that reside d in 10 coastal counties through Socia l Services Block Grant funding. Transition planning for CYSHCN was completed June 2015 to ensure continuity of supports with their SCHS CMU and long -term recovery groups. Looking back, strategies to sustain and improve resilience were learned through the challenges of SSS and are used to strengthen Title V's resilience in t he advent of hurricane season. These tactics include ongoing collaboration among local and State emergency preparedness services to facilitate the sharing of information and resources with families of CYSCHN, updating and maintaining written and electronic consumer an d professional resources on programs and services, and planning with families for future needs . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 15 3.C. Needs Assessment C.1. Needs Assessment Update The Five -Year Needs Assessment Summary was submitted with the FY 2016 Application/FY 2014 Annual Report . The next Five-Year Needs Assessment is due with next year's 2020 MCH Title V Block Grant Application and Annual Report. The NJ Title V P rogram, the Division of Family Health Services (FHS), has not altered its Five -Year Needs Assessment that identifies consistent with health status goals and national health objectives the need for: preventive and primary care services for pregnant women, mothers and i nfants; preventive and primary care services for children; and services for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN). For the 201 8 MCH Title V Block Grant Application/Annual Report there were n o changes to S tate Priority Need (SPN) Findings or the selection of National Performance Measures ( NPM ) selection. The MCH Population Needs remain unchanged . The Organizational Structure of the NJ Department of Health and the Division of Family Health Services (FHS), the NJ Title V agency, remain s unchanged . Lisa Asare MPH was appointed the Assistant Commissioner for FHS in 2015 . Dr. Marilyn Gorney -Daley was appointed the Director of MCH Services for FHS in April 2017. The Agency C apacity of FHS remains unchanged with the continuation of all majo r federal grants . Efforts continues toward Workforce Development an d Capacity. Expanded partnerships, collaborations, and coordination of MCH programs continue especially involving the Healthy Women Healthy Families Initiative and the MIEC Home Visiting P rogram . FHS will be working very closely with NJDOH Office of Population Health and has created an FHS -Population Health Team (FHS -PHT) with the purpose of (a) ensuring health in all policies, (b) l everag ing resources and inter - and intra-departmental coll aborations , and, (c) a ddressing using a multi -sectorial approach . Zika virus and its potential for Zika virus infections and related birth defects continues to be a concern in New Jersey, emphasiz ing the need to continue strengthening and expanding partnerships. The Reproductive and Perinatal Health Services (RPHS) continues to work with Communicable Disease Services (CDS) for early identification of pregnant women with Zika infection. Respective pro viders are educated on the latest CDC guidelines for management of such cases in addition to the collection of vital surveillance data. Home visits through the work of local public health nurses are also conducted for the assessment of specific needs and e ducation of these families. This will continue until the end of July 2018. Moreover, education sessions are provided to the community for raising awareness about Zika. Recently, CDC issued a new funding opportunity to continue this work and expand infant f ollow -up to 24 months. In collaboration with CDS, RPHS has applied for this new funding opportunity which would continue the work for the Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry until July of 2019. FHS is currently funding the 3 Maternal Child Health Consortia to implement Opioid education among providers in New Jersey. Educational sessions on substance use disorders will be conducted in all 3 regions (north, south, and central) of the state. Through restoration of significant funding for family planning, N JDOH support th is provision through a grant with the New Jersey Family Planning League to ensure that family planning services are available in all 21 counties in NJ. Family planning services not only include family planning but also related preventive health services .

Process Description The completion of a comprehensive needs assessment for the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) population groups is a continual process that the FHS performs in collaboration with many other organizations and partners . The needs assessment process is consisten t with the conceptual framework in Figure 1 MCH Needs Assessment, Planning, Implementation, and Monitoring Process in the guidance . The ultimate goals of the needs assessment process are to strengthen partnerships and collaboration efforts within FHS, the NJ Department of Health (NJDOH), the MCH Bureau, and among other agencies and organizations involved with MCH and to improve outcomes for the MCH populations. Table 1 a - Title V MCH Block Grant Five -Year Needs Assessment Framework Logic Model (See Supporting Document #1) summarizes the selected ten national Performance Measures (NPMs ) and aligns the impact of Evidence -Based Informed Strategy Measures (ESMs) on NPMs and National Outcome Measures (NOMs) . The purpose of the ESMs is to identify state Ti tle V program efforts which can contribute to improved performance relative to the selected NPMs . The Logic Model is organized with one NPM per row . The Logic Model is the key representation which summarizes the Five -Year Needs Assessment process and inclu des the three -tiered performance measurement system with Evidence - Based or Informed Strategy Measures (ESM), National Performance Measures (NPM), and National Outcome Measures (NOMs) . The Logic Model represents a more integrated system created by the three - tiered performance measure framework which ties the ESMs to the NPMs which in turn influence the NOMs. C.2.b .

(3) Collaborates with informal community leaders/groups (e.g. natural networks, informal leaders, spiritual leaders, ethnic media and family advocacy groups) and families of culturally diverse groups in needs/assets assessments, program planning, service delivery and evaluation/ monitoring/quality improvement activities. (4) Secure allocation of resources to adequately meet the unique access, informational and service needs of culturally diverse groups. (5) Develop and implement performance standards for staff and contractors that incorporate cultural competence practices and policies. (6) Provide policies and guidelines that support the above identified items and approaches. A table (Table 1e - Staffing fo r MCHS and SCHEIS) has been attached (see Supporting Document #1) which summarizes the names and qualifications of senior level management employees who serve in lead MCH -related positions and program staff who contribute to the state's planning, evaluatio n, and data analysis capabilities. Title V SCHEIS and MCH staff are active participants and represent the NJDOH on the NJ Statewide Network on Cultural Competence (NJSNCC) to ensure that there is access to equitable and quality services for individuals, f amilies, and communities through culturally and linguistically appropriate service delivery. As part of their mission, the NJSNCC holds an annual conference for service providers, policymakers, researchers and other stakeholders on culturally competent car e. The theme of the recent annual conference held December 5, 201 7 was \" Improving Health & Mental Health Literacy in Diverse Communities: Why Partnerships Matter \". The Keynote speaker was Dr. Cynthia Baur, who is the Endowed Chair and Director for the Horowitz Center for Health Literacy, School of Public Health, University of Maryland College Park, MD. Dr. Baur has been instrumental in the development of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) health literacy website. Her research and sch olarly writings are extensive and highly publicized in various journals of Health, Healthcare, Health Communication, Nursing and Medicine. Her keynote address outlined the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy, including health literacy paradigm shifting from individual deficits in literacy and knowledge to organizational policies, practices, and routines. A call to action to build relationships and harness the power of information, communication, and partners to create communities and a health literate society provided a challenge to the participants at the conference. Workshop presentations focused on one of the four conference goals: to improve access to culturally and linguistically appropriate information, resources, and programs for meeting health promotion and disease prevention objectives; to address health and mental health literacy challenges experienced by diverse populations and communities throughout the lifespan; to increase knowledge about how to assess the reliability and trustworth iness of health, behavioral health, and disability -related information resources and to foster networking and collaboration between libraries, consumers, and health and human services professionals to address various needs and build on community assets and strength. The workshops included: Reducing Barriers and Biases: Cultural Considerations for African American and Latino Families Involved in Child Maltreatment Investigations NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 20 Where Can I Find Health Information in...?

A poster session was held for the second time this year, addressing issues relating to the conference goals mentioned earlier. Eight posters were submitted for the poster session. Some of the posters highlight ed the following topics: Collaborative Health Literacy Efforts Aiming to Making Diverse New Jerseyans Healthier Early Intervention and Public Libraries Working Together to Support Infants and Toddlers with Special Needs Championing Health Literacy in Pediatric Integrated Care: Addressing the Challenge Through Needs Assessment and Outcome Management Reading for All: A Free Accessible Library Service This program was awarded 5.75 Continuing Education Credits to RNs, and 4.5 CEs to Social Workers. One o f the successes of the NJSNCC this year was the ability to apply for a small grant to the National Libraries of Medicine -MidAtlantic Region (NNLM -MAR) through SPAN, who administers the annual conference for the NJSNCC. They also forged a new partnership wi th the New Jersey State Library, who helped write a portion of the grant and involved individuals from the library field. The NJSNCC continues to conduct 1 hour webinars on a quarterly basis for service providers and other interested individuals with a focus on cultural competence. Webinars presented in 201 7 included: Immigrant Integration: A Challenge for Our Time. In this webinar, the meaning of immigrant integration was discussed, why it is deserving of careful attention by policy makers and practit ioners, how the US compares to other countries in its integration outcomes, and what policies and practices show promise of fostering immigrant inclusion and participation. This webinar was presented by Nicholas Montalto, PhD, from Diversity Dynamics, LLC. Health Disparities: You know there's a need, now prove it! This webinar was presented by Kate Flewelling, MLIS, Executive Director, National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Middle Atlantic Region, University of Pittsburgh. This webinar showed that inequ ity exists, including in health acce ss and outcomes. This entry -level presentation explored online sources of reliable health statistics, research and evidence -based community interventions .

NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 21 An upcoming Conference is being planne d for November or December of this year , 201 8. The focus of this annual conference will be on: Improving Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Service Delivery to People with Disabilities: A Life Span Perspective. New members have joined the Network an d are expected to be active participants in the various groups. FHS recently evaluated its current and future workforce requirements for the State's MCH Services . The evaluation resulted in reclassification of titles to meet the needs of the changing rol es and requirements and keeping aligned with the DOH's strategic plan. FHS hired employees and are hiring new employees in the title series of Health Data Specialist and Analyst, Research and Evaluation to support MCH Epidemiology Program and SCHEIS Progra m. Additionally, we are preparing to hire additional Quality Assurance Specialists. Hiring employees in these titles will improve effectiveness and efficiency of the public health system especially in the MCH programs . The vacant positions were related to retirements, resignations and promotions. DOH recently planned a Performance Management Training. Two classroom training sessions were held in June, in addition to a webinar that was available to all staff. This training will provide staff to oversee and improve the actions that it takes to enact health policies and plans, to assess health outcomes of at risk maternal and child health communities and to adapt or change policies in order to better achieve the desired outcomes. The establishment and implemen tation of a Performance Management System is also a sound operation and management practice and a requirement for successful Public Health Accreditation. The Department became a nationally accredited health department in 2017. C.b.iii. Title V Program Partnerships, Collaboration, and Coordination This section summarizes the relevant organizational relationships which serve the MCH populations and expand the capacity and reach of the state Title V MCH and CSHCN programs. Table 1f - MCH Organizational R elationships with Partnerships, Collaboration, and Cross -Program Coordination (See Supporting Document #1) summarizes the partnerships, collaborations, and cross -program coordination established by the state Title V program with public and private sector entities; federal, state and local government programs; families/consumers; primary care associations; tertiary care facilities; academia; and other primary and public health organizations across the state that address the priority needs of the MCH populat ion but are not funded by the state Title V program. Section s II.F.2. and II.F.3. describes relevant organizational relationships between FHS and the State Human Services agencies (mental health, social services/child welfare, education, corrections, Medi caid, SCHIP, Social Security Administration, Vocational Rehabilitation, disability determination unit, alcohol and substance abuse, rehabilitation services); the relationship of State and local public health agencies (including MCH Consortia) and federally qualified health centers; primary care associations; tertiary care facilities; and available technical resources which enhance the capacity of the Title V program. Section II.F.2. also describes the plan for coordination of the Title V program with (1) t he Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program (EPSDT), (2) other federal grant programs (including WIC, related education programs, and other health, developmental disability, and family planning programs), and (3) providers of services to identify pregnant women and infants who are eligible for Title XIX (Medicaid) and to assist them in applying for services. NJ has prided itself on its regional ized MCH services and programs, which are coordinated through the Maternal Child Health Con sortia (MCHC), a n established regionalized network of maternal and child health providers with emphasis on prevention a nd community -based activities. The MCHC are charged with developing regional perinatal and pediatric plans, total quality improvement sys tems, professional and consumer education, transport systems, data analysis, and infant fol low-up programs. The three MCHC are located in the northern, central and southern regions of the state, with the northern region representing the largest number of b irths. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 22 The Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) operate in all of NJ's 21 counties . The 24 FQHCs have a combined 118 licensed sites throughout the State . As a consequence of expansion and capacity - building initiatives overall growth in the number of uninsured visits r eimbursed has been exponential. In SFY 2016, 175,525 uninsured/underinsured residents were serviced and 466,081 uninsured/underinsured visits reimbursed, which was a 15% increase from SFY 2015. In SFY 2017, the FQHC -Uncompensated Care F und was funded at $28 million. In SFY2017, the FQHCs served a total of 180,303 uninsured/underinsured residents and 490,420 uninsured/underinsured visits were reimbursed . In SFY 2018, the FQHC -Uncompensated Care Fund was funded at $30 million. The NJ Title V CYSHCN Program, also referred to as Special Child Health and Early Intervention Services (SCHEIS), located in the NJDOH , partners, collaborates, and coordinates with many different governmental and nongovernmental entities, on federal, state, and local levels, as well as parents, families and caregivers, primary care physicians, specialists, other health care providers, hospitals, advocacy organizations, and many others to facilitate access to coordinated, comprehensive, cultura lly competent care f or CYSHCN. The Title V CYSHCN program works with programs within DHS and DCF in addressing many needs facing CYSHCN including medical, dental, developmental, rehabilitative, menta l health, and social services. DHS administers Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XX (Social Services Block Grant ) services and provides critical supports for ensuring access to early periodic screening detect ion and treatment for CYSHCN. The State DHS Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) NJ Family Care Program, and the Division of Disability Services afford eligible children comprehensive health insurance coverage to access primary, specialty, and home health care that CYSHCN and their families need . In order to ensure access to health insurance a nd benefits to enrolled CYSHCN, SCHEIS collaborates with the Department of Banking and Insurance (DOBI), Division of Insurance colleagues in the development of policy and procedure; i.e., Grace's Law, EIS, and Autism. Likewise, DOBI partners participate wi th SCHEIS in provider and consumer education and advocacy and has provide d technical assistance and training at the SCHS quarterly meetings . The DCF is focused on strengthening families and achieving safety, well -being, and permanency for all NJ's child ren. Current priorities focus on child welfare, safety, health, family strengthening, and the establishment of foster homes . DCF is also engaged in reengineering child abuse prevention, building capacity in the child behavioral health system, and improving the system of health care for children in the State's care . Collaboration between State SCHEIS, local agencies implementing CYSHCN health and related support services, and the statewide DCF system are ongoing to ensure access to health and related service s to the most vulnerable CYSHCN . The Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN) , now called SPAN Parent Advocacy Network, and the NJAAP are key partners with the Title V Program in NJ in many initiatives and projects to better serv e CYSHCN and empower fami lies. The Statewide Community of Care Consortium (COCC), a leadership group of SPAN, dedicated to improving NJ's performance on the six core outcomes for CYSHCN and their families, includes three co -conveners from Title V, SPAN and NJAAP. This group also i ncludes DHS, DCF, the NJ Primary Care Association, and over 60 statewide participating stakeholder organizations. The COCC partners are continuing to work to improve the access of children with mental health challenges to needed care, and to improve the ca pacity of primary care providers to address mental health issues within their practice. A Family Guide to Integrating Mental Health and Pediatric Primary Care has been developed and shared with families. COCC co -conveners continue to meet with NJ's child protection agency, DCF Division of Protection and Child Permanency, about addressing challenges for children with mental health needs under their care. Section II.F.3. Family/Consumer Partnerships provides more detail on the relevant organizational relationships which serve the MCH populations and expand the capacity and reach of the state Title V MCH and CSHCN programs. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 23 C.2.c. Identifying Priority Needs and Linking to Performance Measures The State Priority Needs selected by NJ for its Title V P rogram during the 5-year reporting period have been determined by a thorough examination of the findings from the state's 5-Year Needs Assessment, as highlighted in the Needs Assessment Summary of the first -year Application/Annual Report. This section describes the relationship of the State Priority Needs, the National and State Performance Measures, and the capacity and resources of the State Title V P rogram. Table 10 - State Priority Needs from Five -Year Needs Assessment Form 9 State Priority Needs (SPNs) New (N), Replaced (R) or Continued (C) Priority Need for this 5-Year Reporting Period Rational e including National and State Performance and National Outcome Measure N R C 1) Increasing Healthy Births X NPM 1,2 ,3; NOMs 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,21,22 ; SPM 1 2) & Physical Activity X NPM 8; NOM 9,11,13 3) Reducing Black Infant Mortality X NPM 1,2 ,3,4,5; SPM 1 ; NOM 1 -9 Youth Development X NPM 6,10, 11,12; NOM 10,11,13,15,16,17 5) Improving Access CYSHCN X NPM 11,12; SPM 3,4,5 ; NOM 18,19,20,23 6) Reducing Teen Pregnancy X NPM 11 7) Improving & Integrating Information Systems X All NPMs, SPMs, NOMs 8) Smoking Prevention X NPM 14 SPN #1. Increasing Healthy Births is a long-standing State Priority Need (SPN) that encompasses reducing low birth weight, preterm births, infant mortality, and increasing first trimester prenatal care , adequate prenatal care , and Maternal/ Women's Health . SPN #1 addresses the needs of the population domains of Maternal/Women's Health and Perinatal/Infant Health and is impacted by the NPMs 1, 2 and 3. Several initiatives address healthy births including the Home Visiting Program, Healthy Start outreach activities, Community Action Team projects based on FIMR findings, the Perinatal Addictions Prevention Projects and most recently the Healthy Women, Healthy Families (formerly known as the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes) Initiative. Demonstrating its prioritization of Increasing Health Births, RPHS released in 201 8 a competitive request for applications to improve perinatal outcomes and reducing black infant mortality , called the Healthy Women, Healthy Families (HWHF) initiative that uses the services models of Communi ty Health Workers and Central Intake. The HWHF Initiative is coordinated with existing federal and state -funded initiatives including but not limited to Healthy Start, MIECHV, Strong Start, Title X Family Planning, Childhood Lead Exposure Prevention and Healthy Homes, Perinatal Addictions Prevention, Postpartum Mood Disorders, Coordinated School Health, WIC, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the activities of the Community Health & Wellness Service Unit of the FHS (smoking, diabetes, cardiac, cancer, obesity prevention, physical fitness, hypertension) . SPN #2. Improving Nutrition and Physical Activity is a relatively recent SPN to address the obesity epidemic . The SPN #2 addresses needs in the 4 population domains of Maternal/Women's Health, Perinatal/Infant Health, Child Health, and Adolescent/Young Adult Health and impact s on NPM #8 and NOMs 9 and 11. The obesity epidemic is taking a toll on the future health of our children by contributing to the rise in related chronic diseases and disabil ities, and adding billions of additional dollars in health care costs . Children who are obese are at grave risk of lifelong, chronic health problems like heart disease, diabetes, asthma, arthritis and cancer. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 24 In SFY2018, regional DOH School Health NJ gr antees, in collaboration with Sustainable Jersey for Schools (SJS) supported the following nutrition and physical activity actions with $120,000 in small grants to public schools, grades six and above: 1) Breakfast After the Bell; 2) Healthy Food Choices B eyond the Cafeteria; 3) Create or Expand a School Garden; 4) Access to Healthy Water; 5) Create or Strengthen Policies to Promote Physical Activity; 6) Programs to Promote Physical Activity; 7) Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety and Promotion Initiatives; 8) S chool Travel Plans for Walking and Biking; and, 9) Safe Routes to School District Policy. Refer to NPM#8 for the number of NJ schools or districts, having successfully completed the actions related to physical activity. As of March 2018, the number of scho ols or districts having successfully completed the actions for improving nutrition, is given below: Actions to Improve Nutrition # Schools & Districts Approved 2017 # Schools & Districts Approved 2018 # Schools & Districts Approved 2019 # Schools & Districts Approved 2020 Breakfast After the Bell (School (S) or District (D) 30 (S) 8 (D) Healthy Food Choices Beyond the Cafeteria (S, D) 26 (S) 7 (D) Create or Expand a School Garden (S) 58 Access to Healthy Water (S) 57 SPN #3. Reducing Black Infant Mortality has been a long -standing priority for MCHS . SPN #3 addresses the needs of the population domains of Maternal/Women's Health and Perinatal/Infant Health and is impacted by the NPMs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In 2013 NJDOH was invited to participate in the third round of the National Governors Association Learning Network on Improving Birth Outcomes Initiative ( NGA IBO Initiative). In 2014 NJDOH was also invited to participate in the Infant Mortality Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Networks (IM CoIIN) sponsored by th e MCH Bureau with technical assistance from National Institute for Children's Health Quality . IM CoIIN is a state -driven HRSA -coordinated partnership to accelerate improvements in infant mortality by helping states: 1) i nnovate and improve their approaches to reducing infant mortality and improving birth outcomes through communication and sharing across state lines; and 2) u se the science of quality improvement and collaborative learning to improve birth outcomes. The multi -sector IM CoIIN State Team from NJ identified two priority areas - improving postpartu m rates and smoking cessation. The NGA IBO Initiative workgroups will continue as the IM CoIIN Strategy Teams to develop recomm endations for improving birth outcomes and preventing infant mortality . In 2014 RPHS implemented the IPO Initiative as a means to prevent infant mortality in the highest risk communities. The IPO Initiative through a collaborative coordinated community -driven approach will work to improve maternal and infant health outcomes for high -need women of childbearing age and their families, while reducing racial, ethnic and economic disparities in those outcomes. The IPO Initiati ve with a Central Intake model and Community Health Workers will be collaborating with the IM CoIIN to implement the recommendations. The IPO Initiative goal is to work towards reducing and eliminating disparities by utilizing community health workers from the community they serve and implement innovative programs to eliminate disparities such as the Community Doula Program which is bla ck women serving black women. In April 2018 RPHS issu ed a RFP for the Healthy Women Healthy Families initiative which will r etool the current IPO project. There will be 2 parts to this project. The first component will focus on black infant mortality redu ction and will target municipalities with the highest black infant mortality rates. The second component will be county -based and use a combined model of Community Health Workers and Referral Specialist. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 25 SPN #4. Promoting Youth Development utilizes a stre ngth-based approach to meet the needs of the Adolescents and Young Adults domain . This approach has been demonstrated to impact multiple risk behaviors . The Teen Outreach Program (TOP) implemented by NJ PREP is an evidence -based youth development program. As of September 2017, the collaboration with The Department of Children and Families resulted in the offering of TOP Training to 20 of their middle school based youth services ( SBYS) Staff, of which 13 schools are either piloting or f ully implementing the program. Conversations with DCF will continue to take place to solidify how many of their middle schools will continue implementing so a budget can be negotiated for continued program delivery. Through the statewide Youth Advisory Board (YAB) initiative al l PREP, AEP and School Health Grantees have attended an advisor training and are in the process of recruiting teens and planning eve nts with the regional mentors. This year is being used as a pilot for recruitment strategies and location and transportation logistics. All Youth Advisory Boards will be fully run ning starting October 1, 2018. The YAB's purpose is to ensure that youth are actively engaged in the planning, implementation and evaluation of all NJDOH supported programs . In addition, ACF's Title V Abstinence Education Program (AEP) grantees are incorporating youth development activities such as community service learning (CSL) and the evid ence -based program Photovoice. SPN #5. Improving Access to Quality Care for CYSHCN is prioritized through collaboration and partnership building, targeting resources and efforts to maintain capacity, and comprehensively addressing the six MCHB core outcomes for CYSHCN and State Performance Measures (#3, 4, & 5, and impacts National Performance Measures 11 and 12. The network of specialty providers, linkages with enabling services provided by Special Child Health Services Case Management Units (CMUs), collaboration with intergovernmental agencies and community -based organizations (refer to stakeholder list), an d leadership from the State agency strengthens the safety net of a ccess to care for NJ's CYSHCN. Although many of NJ's CYSHCN have access to primary care, the coordination of care for medically fragile children is often managed through their specialty prov iders; Child Evaluation Centers (CECs), Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/ Disorder (FAS/ FASD ) Centers, Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Anomalies Centers, Tertiary Care Centers and Rya n White Part D HIV Care Network , and NJ is attempting to revers e that tr end. SCHEIS is working with the NJ Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics (NJAAP) and SPAN's efforts to promote medical home initiatives developed to encourage collaboration between pediatric subspecialis ts and primary care providers. NJ is worki ng toward all CYSHCN receiving high -quality, comprehensive care through a medical home that assures timely access to necessary pediatric specialty and subspecialty care, community supports, and transition to adult care when appropriate. In 2015, the FCCS p rogram received a HRSA Integration Systems Grant (ISG) to address the overarching goal of increasing m edical home for CYSHCN by 20%. Partners of this project include SPAN, NJ -AAP, and SCHS CMUs. This project was completed August 31, 2017. Title V efforts to improve quality of care included continued collaboration with many partners in addressing the 6 core outcomes for CYSHCN through parent -professional medical home initiatives . Using a multi -county approach, outreach was conducted to pediatric and family practices and FQHCs throughout all of NJ. The SCHS CMUs provided lists of providers that routinely served CYSCHN in their caseloads, and SPAN and NJAAP invited practices to \"Kick Off\" events providing an overview of the medical home/ SIG initiative. Title V provided consultation on specialized pediatric services and case management, presented at medical home learning collaborative meetings and care coordination webinars, and provided resources to practices. Likewise, NJ continues to collaborate with Consort ium of Care partners to improve quality of care through medical home training an d consultation with providers. Participants share updates in programs and services to facilitate appropriate referrals resulting in access to care, including Perform Care, serv ices for CYSHCN with developmental disabilities through DCF, and the DHS Division of Developmental Disabilities. Likewise, State staffs will continue to provide technical assistance and monitoring of Title V service providers including interviews of client s that have received services. The electronic BDARS and CMRS provides opportunities to view client referrals and service outcomes, and reinforce the SCHS CM - client interactions. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 26 State FCCS staffs and health services grantees attend trainings on health car e reform, NJ FamilyCare and Medicaid expansion, participate in CMS webinars, and collaborate with commun ity-based enrollment agencies. They also educate clients and their families about the benefits of health care reform for CYSHCN and their families, and link them to enroll ment counselors as appropriate. Anecdotally, the information gained through trainings was particularly of interest for uninsured parents and extended adult family members of CYSHCN . SPN #6. Reducing Teen Pregnancy has been identified as a priority by several Departments including: DOH, DOE, DHS and DCF with several inter -agency initiatives developed to address this priority . Teenage childbearing can have long -term negative effects on both the teenage mother and the infant . Infants born to teen mothers are at higher risk of bein g low birthweight and preterm. They are also far more likely to be born into families with limited educa tional and economic resources. Although t een pregnancy and birth rates are at historic lows , there were 3,374 teen births in NJ in 201 6 and the teen birth rate was 11 births for every 1,000 adolescent females aged 15 -19 years . Preventing teen births in NJ translates to significant savings for NJ taxpayers. The teen birth rate in NJ declined 73% between 1991 and 2016. The total costs of teen childbearing include those sometimes incurred by the children of teen mothers (public health care insurance programs, primarily Medicaid and CHIP, increased child welfare participation, and increased risk for incarceration amo ng adolescents or young adults) and the associated lost tax revenue due to decreased earnings and spending. In SFY 2017, NJ PREP and AEP programs were successfully implemented by ten (10) grantees at over 100 community and school based sites reaching ove r 10,000 NJ youth . Grant funds for Title V AEP was awarded to 4 grantees, 2 in the northern region, 1 in central and the fourth in the southern region . SPN #7. Improving and Integrating Information Systems involves multiple efforts by the MCH Epidemiology Program, FHS and the NJDOH to improve and integrate public health information systems in order to promote public health surveillance and to improve the delivery of public health services and programs . Activities are related to almost ev ery NPMs, SPMs and NOMs. Improving and Integrating Information Systems is a significant priority for the MIEC Home Visiting Program and the HWHF (former IPO) Initiative. Improving the MCH system of care will depend on quality data from an integrated inform ation system. The MCH Epidemiology Program continues to work with the NJDOH Center for Health Statistics to improve the availability of MCH related public health data through the interactive online NJ State Health Assessment Data (SHAD) system. Examples of improving access to and integration of public health information are discussed in sections specific to the performance measures and health systems capacity indicators. SPN #8. Smoking Prevention Smoking prevention has been a long -term NJDOH priority. The Five-Year Needs Assessment identified smoking prevention as a SPN from past MCH Block Grant Applications, the annual NJDOH Budget Planning process, and monitoring H ealthy People 2020 objectives. Recent involvement of FHS in the NGA Improving Birth Outcom es Initiative and the IM CoIIN ha s increased the recognition that smoking prevention plays in improving birth outcomes, preventing prematurity and reducing infant mortality . FHS has several programs that include a smoking prevention component that could be streng thened with further collaboration with the Office of Community Health and Wellness.

The State Title V Programs Budget and Expenditures by Types of Service, parallels the MCH pyramid which organizes MCH Services hierarchically from direct health care services through infrastructure building services . 3.D.2. Budget NJ has traditionally maintained commitment of State funding support for maternal and child health activities . Since 1989, maintenance of effort has included State appropriations for children with special health care needs and support for population -based out reach and education for pregnant women and their infants. State appropriations support a number of maternal and child health programs . In the State Fiscal Year 2018 budget most programs and services are maintained at the SFY 201 7 levels. Based on the crit ical nature of the budget deficit in the state the proposed budget demonstrates an ongoing commitment on the part of the State to support to the best of its ability services to the maternal and child health population .

State Action Plan Narrative Overview 3.E.2.a State Title V Program Purpose and Design The NJ Title V program's partnership and leadership roles in accomplishing the MCH Block Grant's goals and mission are described in Section 3.E.2.b.1 MCH Workforce Development below and summarized in Table 1f - MCH Orga nizational Relationships with Partnerships, Collaboration, and Cross -Program Coordination. 3.E.2.b. Supportive Administrative Systems and Processes Partnerships that influence NJ Title V program's ability to meet its planning goals and objectives are described below in Section 3.E.2.b.2. Family Partnership and summarized in Table 1g - Family/Consumer Partnerships. 3.E.2.b.1 MCH Workforce Development NJDOH has identified through the State Health Assessment, the State Health Improvement Plan and the Departments' Five Year Strategic Plan, the need to improve the public health workforce in the areas of access to care, quality improvement, systems integration and population health management. MCH workforce development and capacity is also a priority for the Division of Family Health Services (FHS). As such, the FHS developed and has initiated an MCH Workforce Development and Capacity Plan with the overall goal to prepare present and future maternal and child health workers with the skills and knowledge to succeed in the transformed public health system under the Affordable Care Act. Without an adequately trained MCH staff, vital Title V services and functions would not be provided to meet the needs of the current and future MCH population. Recognizing the value of an experienced and trained staff, the FHS has taken action to improve the capacity of the MCH workforce despite a long -standing hiring freeze . The FHS implemented the development of succession planning to assure essential functions were consider ed in long -term planning. During this past fiscal year, cross -training of staff was implemented to assure the ability to maintain key roles in the event of short -term staffing shortages. Changes in the workforce funded by Title V have been quite minimal, r eflecting the long -standing MCH priorities and core functions of staff. A Division -wide survey was conducted to identify gaps and needs related to sk ills development and training. Staff identified several areas such as the need for further training and the development of metrics that are specific to the long -term outcome measurement of maternal and child health in order to maintain the momentum of quality improvement already begun by the NJDOH. Multiple needs were also identified in the areas of data measur ement, collection and integration. The majority of staff concurred there was a need for training to help them effectively conduct return on investment ( ROI) analyses of MCH programs. As a result of the NJDOH's paradigm shift toward results -based accountabi lity, additional training is needed for staff to become skilled in collecting data appropriate for accountability documentation and to develop accountability metrics to better calculate the ROI for MCH programs t ied to public health outcomes. FHS also reco gnized the need for incorporating the perspectives of families and family representatives into the MCH workforce under the broader umbrella of systems integration. Continued family involvement in health transformation is essential for effective program and policy development related to newly aligned systems. Critical workforce developmental and training needs of state Title V staff have included extensive training in continuous quality improvement (CQI) to increase the capacity of the workforce to understa nd, select and use QI methods and tools but also to foster a CQI culture at FHS and eventually to the local agencies that are funded by MCH Block. We have already seen the positive results of this training through the participation of staff in the Collabor ative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, and the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program. Given the diversity of our state, cultural competency trainings continue to be provided to staff as a n essential component of their contin uing education activities. Other available opportunities have been pursued through trainings offered at national conferences including AMCHP, the MCH Epidemiology Conference, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 33 and the MCH Public Health Leadership Institu te. Departmental trainings have been offered on Ethics, grant writing, and grants management . Opportunities to supplement staffing through student internships, special temporary assignments, fellowship programs and state assignees have also been successful. FHS plans to implement a department wide Health Equity Workforce Development Training to address health disparities and inequality. The training will be implemented in several phases. Phase one will include training for all MCH staff. Phase t wo provide training in a train -the trainer format for FHS staff and grantees. Phase three will include community -based trainings by CHW staff to providers in grantee designated catchment areas. FHS staff and grantees will receive ongoing trainings provided by other state agencies to increase access to resources for at risk populations in disparate communities. The focus on workforce development will continue to be a pivotal component of FHS operations. As such, each staff person has a requirement under the ir individualized Performance Assessment Report, a criterion to include a professional development plan for each yearly rating period (October 1 to September 30). FHS recently evaluated its current and future workforce requirements for the State's MCH Se rvices. The evaluation resulted in reclassification of titles to meet the needs of the changing roles and requirements and keeping aligned with NJDOH's strategic plan. FHS hired employees and are hiring new employees in the title series of Health Data Spec ialist and Analyst, Research and Evaluation to support the MCH Epidemiology and SCHEIS Programs . Additionally, we are preparing to hire additional Quality Assurance Specialists. Hiring employees in these titles will improve effectiveness and efficiency of the public health system e specially in the MCH programs. The vacant positions resulted from retirements, resignations and promotions. The workforce capacity of MCH service units and programs is described previously in section II. C.2.b.ii .a (Organizational Structure ) and Section II. C.2.b.ii.c. (MCH Workfo rce Capacity). This section more completely describes FHS's capacity to promote and protect the health of all mothers and children, including children and youth with spec ial health care needs (CYSHCN). The Maternal and Child Health Services (MCHS) and Special Child Health and Early Intervention Services (SCHEIS) Units ensure a statewide system of services that reflect the principles of comprehensive, community -based, coordinated, family -centere d care through collaboration with other agencies and private organizations and the coordination of health services with other services at the community level. The mission of the FHS is to improve the health, safety, and well -being of f amilies and communit ies in NJ. The FHS works to promote and protect the health of mothers, children, adolescents, and at -risk populations, and to reduce disparities in health outcomes by ensuring access to quality comprehensive care. Our ultimate goals are to enhance the qual ity of life for each person, family, and community, and to make an investment in the health of future generations. Table 1d - Title V Program Capacity and Collaboration to Ensure a Statewide System of Services (See Supporting Document #1) summarizes accor ding to the six MCH population health domains the collaborations with other state agencies and private organizations, the state support for communities, the coordination with community -based systems, and the coordination of health services with other servi ces at the community level. Preventive and Primary Care for Pregnant Women, Mothers and Infants The mission of Maternal and Child Health Services (MCHS) within FHS is to improve the health status of NJ families, infants, children and adolescents in a cul turally competent manner, with an emphasis on low - income and special populations. Prenatal care, reproductive health services, perinatal risk reduction services for women and their partners, postpartum depression, mortality review, child care, early childh ood systems development, childhood lead exposure prevention, immunization, oral health and hygiene, student health and wellness, nutrition and physical fitness and teen pregnancy prevention ar e all part of the MCHS effort. The population Domains addressed by MCHS include 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 34 Reproductive and Perinatal Health Services (RPHS), within MCHS, coordinates a regionalized system of care of mothers and children in collaboration with the Maternal and Child Health Cons ortia (MCHC). The MCHC were developed to promote the delivery of the highest quality of care to all pregnant women and newborns, to maximize utilization of highly trained perinatal personnel and intensive care facilities, and to promote a coordinated and c ooperative prevention -oriented a pproach to perinatal services. Continuous quality improvement activities are coordinated on the regional level by the MCHC. Promoting a Life Course perspective, a request for proposals (RFP) was issued in January 2014 by RPHS and awarded last year called the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes (IPO) Initiative which targeted limited public health resources to populations and communities with the highest need to improve quality access to prenatal care, preconception and interconcept ion care as a means to decrease infant mortality rates. Using two models, Community Health Workers and Central Intake, the IPO Initiative work ed to improve specific maternal and infant health outcomes including preconception care, prenatal care, interconc eptual care, preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality through implementation of evidence -based and/or best practice strategies across three key life course stages: preconception, prenatal/postpartum and interconception. In 2018 RPHS issued a RFP for the Healthy Women, Healthy Families Initiative which will r etool the current IPO project. There will be 2 parts to this project. The first component will focus on black infant mortality reduction and will target municipalities with the highest black infant mortality rates. The second component will be county -based and use a combined model of Community Health Workers and Referral Specialist. MCHS has embraced the Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FIMR) Program as a mechanism for quality improvement and improve the system of c are to promote healthy births. FIMR is one of the original American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist s (ACOG) Partnership projects. The overall goal of NJ FIMR is to establish a statewide system of fetal -infant mortality rev iew by implementing or expanding FIMR projects with each of the 3 regional MCH Consortia. NJ follows guidelines for planning and implementing community fetal and infant mortality review developed by the National Fetal -Infant Mor tality Review Program (NFIMR ). The projects use standardized data collection, entry and reporting methods to ensure consistency of the review process throughout the State. This includes using data abstraction and case review summary forms developed by NFIMR and modified by NJ FIMR. NJ is participating with NFIMR as one of the states beta testing the new database. The NJ Maternal Mortality Review Team is part of a longstanding commitment among healthcare professionals and other concerned citizen to reduce and prevent the number of dea ths related to pregnancy and ch ildbearing among NJ residents. A multidisciplinary review team is utilized and the primary focus of the Case Review Team is to id entify systems related issues. Recommendations for systems improvement are shared with healthcar e professionals and the public through the Maternal Mortality Report. Team recommendations are also used for program planning at the NJDOH. The major goals of the Perinatal Addictions Prevention Project (PAPP) include providing professional and public ed ucation, encouraging all prenatal providers to screen all of their pregnant patients for substance use/abuse and developing a network of available resources to aid pregnant substance using/abusing women. Risk-reduction coordinators working with this projec t provide ongoing regional professional training, individual on -site training, technical assistance and monitoring, grand rounds training, networking, and a link between regional and local services relating to prenatal substance use/abuse. Approximately 30% of the pregnant women in NJ were screened for substance use during the past year according to the Perinatal R isk Assessment volume numbers. The majority of these patient s were seen at public clinics. Referral information is given to those women who are smoking, using drugs and/or alcohol and those who have possible domestic violence issues. Last year there were 71 education programs held for over 1,414 professionals. There were 504 programs held to educate the general public and approximately 13,944 peo ple participated. FHS is currently funding the 3 Maternal Child Health Consortia to implement Opioid education among providers in New Jersey. Educational sessions on substance use disorders will be conducted in all 3 regions (north, south, and central) of the state. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 35 NJ successfully applied in 2010 for the Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIEC HV) Formula and Competitive Grants to the Health Resource s and Services Administration. The goal of the NJ MIEC HV Program is to expand NJ' s existing system of home visiting services which provides evidence -based family support services to: improve family functioning; prevent child abuse and neglect; and promote child health, safety, dev elopment and school readiness. Full implementation of th e grant project is being carried out in collaboration with the Department o f Children and Families (DCF). Currently evidence -based home visitation services are provided by 67 Local Implementing Agencies (LIAs) providing three national models (Healthy Famil ies America, Parents As Teachers and Nurse Family Partnership) in all 21 NJ counties serving approximately 7,042 families in SFY 201 7. Through the Post -Partum Depression Initiative, education has been provided to over 6,000 healthcare providers . Hospital s and private practitioners are receiving assistance with implementing the law that requires screening and education at specified interval s during the perinatal period. NJDOH offers a PPD helpline (1 -800-328-3838) that operates 24 hours per day, seven days a week to provide resources and information to women and their families and friends. In addition, a dedicated Web site (www.njspeakup.gov) provides educational materials such as brochures, videos, books, support groups, FAQs, and other helpful Web sites o n postpartum depression and other perinatal mood disorders. The NJDOH continues to support the provision of Family Planning via a grant with the NJ Family Planning League to ensure that family planning services are available in a ll 21 counties in NJ. Family Planning agencies provide services in cooperation with other NJDOH initiatives according to Title X national guidelines including: family planning and related preventive health services, such as natural family planning methods; HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections prevention and treatment; services to adolescents; cancer screening (including breast and cervical cancer); nutrition education; preconception and interconception care; infertility services; and counseling on establishing a reproduc tive life plan. Preventive and Primary Care for Children and Adolescents The Child and Adolescent Health Program ( CAHP), within MCHS, focuses on primary prevention strategies involving the three MCH domains of Child Health, Adolescent/Young Adult Health, and the Life Course. An emphasis in Child Health is the prevention of elevated blood lead levels among children under six years of age through collaborative, prevention -oriented outreach and education to parents, property owners, and health care providers. The Childhood Lead Exposure Prevention ( CLEP) Projects use a home visiting model to provide nurse case management an d environmental investigations for children with confirmed blood lead levels of 5 ug/dL or greater. Twenty -four local health departments throughout the State receive funding to provide monitoring of retesting, to perform household education and conduct residential property inspections to id entify and abate lead hazards. The goal of the CLEP Projects is to promote a coordinated support system for children with elevated blood lead levels and their families through the development of stronger linkages with Spe cial Child Health Services, Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), DCF, DOE, Department of Community Affairs, and community -based agencies that provide early childhood services. Services include a healthy homes assessment tool so that additional heal th and safety issues in the home can be identified and remediated so that homes are free of disease -causing agents and so urces of preventable injuries. NJDOH has established a partnership with MIEC Home Visiting programs that provide services for pregnant women, infants, young children, in addition to resource family homes that provide a safe residential environment for children who are in the foster care system. Grants are provided to 24 local health departments to support the provision of nursing case ma nagement and enviro nmental investigation services. In addition, Child Health provides grants to three agencies to administer regional lead and healthy homes coalitions, serving every county in NJ, to provide prevention - focused education and training to par ents, caregivers of young children, and property owners and renters. The NJDOH co -administers the NJ Healthy Homes Training Center which provides training to health, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 36 social services and housing professionals. In partnership with the American Academy of Ped iatrics/NJ Chapter, Child Health promotes a nationally -recognized medical home model. Public outreach and professional education on childhood lead exposure prevention is conducted by three Regional Lea d and Healthy Homes Coalitions. Since July 2010, Adol escent Health has been implementing School Health NJ, which utilizes the CDC Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child ( WSCC) model as its framework. This project was introduced earlier in: Preventive and Primary Care for Children and Adolescents. Three processes are integral for successful implementation of the WSCC model: 1) establish a School Health Team; 2) assess the school's health policies, programs and practices using CDCs School Health Index (SHI) assessment tool; and, 3) develop, implement and e valuate a School Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) ba sed on the results of the SHI. Coordination of the ten WSCC components identifies gaps, avoids duplication of activities and improves the efficiency and effectiveness of health programs and services availab le in the school system. The WSCC School Health regional grantee agencies, selected through a competitive application process, are responsible for the administrative oversight, training, technical assistance and resource support needed by funded or intere sted public schools, grades six and above in their respective northern, central or souther n region. The goal of this project is to improve the health (physical, mental, emotional and social) well -being of students and school staff and strengthen the health and safety of the school environment. Currently, these regional grantee agencies fund schools to implement evidence -based or best practice school health actions . Sustainability of healthy school practices and programs can be ensured through community involvement, parent and youth engagement and policy development and implementation . The Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN) , now called SPAN Parent Advocacy Network, is funded to implement \"Parents as Champio ns (PAC) for Healthy Schools.\" This training empowers parents as \"agents of change\" to facilitate parental action i n promoting healthier schools. This project also partners with various state, local and statewide professional organizations to collaborate on improving school and student health to imp rove their learning and consequently, their life success. On October 1, 2013, Community Health and Wellness was awarded the CDC cooperative agreement DP1305 for the basic and enhanced components of \"State Public Actions to Prevent Chronic Disease and Promote School Health.\" DP1305 ends June 30, 2018. The CAHP successfully applied for and was awarded two new federal grants to prevent teen pregnancy in 2010. The NJ Personal Responsibility Education Program (NJ PREP) and the NJ Abstinence Education Program (NJ AEP) were described in the section on State Priority Need #6: Reducing Teen Pregnancy . The website - \"NJ Parent Link, New Jersey's Early Childhood, Parenting and Professional Resource Center\" http://www.njparentlink.nj.gov was launched in June 201 0 as a web -based resource for consumers and professionals. The website is designed to function as the IT gateway for all State -based services and resources for expectant parents, families with children and NJ children's health, education and welfare profes sionals. NJ Parent Link includes direct linkages to 15 NJ State executive departments, the Governor's office, the legislative and judicial branches, as well as federal and community resources. Community -building features include: county contacts & local links listings; tailored subscription services; continuing education/professional development announcements; a children's art gallery; an easy -to- navigate En Espanol feature and a translation ser vice for over 50 languages. Numerous data collection and quality assurance markers are woven throughout the website's features to maximize assessment capabilities and real-time opportunities for collaboration and coordination of shared goals and resources within the early childhood community.

Preventive and Primary Care for Children wi th Special Health Care Needs NJ maintains a comprehensive system to promote and support access to preventive and primary care for CYSHCN through early identification, linkage t o care, and family support. Title V partially supports this safety net that is comprised of pediatric specialty and sub -specialty, case management, and family support agencies that provide in -state regionalize d and/or county -based services. It is designed to provide family -centered, culturally competent, community -based services for CYSHCN age birth to 21 years of age, and to enhance access to medical home, facilitate transition to adult systems, and health insurance coverage. The Specialized Pediatric Services Programs (SPSP) agencies are a significant resource of pediatric specialty and subspecialty care in NJ, and are used widely by CYSHCN including Medicaid recipients. Although clients are screened for their ability to pay for clinical services, the support provided by Title V enables all CYSHCN to be served regardless of their abi lity to pay . There is no charge for SCHS CM and family support. Administratively housed in the Family Centered Care Services (FCCS) Unit these services include 21 county -based Special Child Health Services Case Management Units (SCHS CMUs), one Family Sup port project, multiple Specialized Pediatric Services Programs (SPSP) which include 9 Child Evaluation Centers (CECs) of which 5 house Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Centers, and 3 provide newborn hearing screening follow -up, 3 Pedi atric Tertiary Centers, and 5 Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Anomalies Centers and a small State operated Fee -for-Service program . Likewise, State and federal collaborations among the FCCS programs and non -Title V funded programs such as the Ryan White Part D Family Centered HIV Care Network (RWPD), Early Intervention System (EIS), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), medical home initiatives, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund (CICRF) and other community -based initiatives extend the safety net through which Title V links CYSHCN with preventive and primary care. CYSHCN are referred into NJ's preventive and primary system of care through mandatory and/or informal pathways . Mandatory reporting by medical providers is required for infants/children that rule in for reportable conditions identified via the Newborn Biochemical Screening and the Birth Defects and Autism Registry programs, and in NJ reporting is linked to access to care . The upcoming expansion o f newborn biochemical screenings to 61 reportable disorders reinforces the continued need to maintain an in -state body of providers to treat children with these conditions, as well as a potential increase in number of referrals to the SPSP agencies, subseq uent reporting to the BDARS, follow -up by SCHS CM and the provision of family support . Receipt of referral by the BDARS results in outreach by the SCHS CMUs, whereby families are offered follow -up and linkage to services . Follow -up is recorded in the elect ronic Case Management Referral System (CMRS), which provides a system for Title V to review and analyze follow -up. Likewise, the SCHS CMUs and SPSP agencies submit registrations of CYSHCN with reportable conditions to the BDARS . Additional formal referral mechanisms that result in linkage to the SCHS CMUs includes the State Data Exchange of SSI applicants under age 16 years and CICRF applicants . Informal linkages to SCHS CM and/or SPSP include self -referral by families, and referral by community -based famil y support and providers for pediatric specialty/subspecialty outpatient care. Through Title V support, each of NJ's 21 counties maintains an SCHS CMU partially funded by its Board of Chosen Freeholders to promote access to preventive and primary care for CYSHCN . With parental consent, SCHS CMUs work with the child's parents, physician and/or specialists to evaluate an affected child's strengths and needs; and collaborates with the family and community -based partners to develop an individual service plan (I SP) for the child and family . Healthcare, educational, rehabilitative, developmental, social, emotional and economic needs of the child and family are targeted. Statewide SFY 2017 data indicate that 16,587 CYSHCN were served, 10,598 ISPs developed, 6,173 S SI referrals received and 4,789 CYSHCN were on SSI . The age distribution indicates that most CYSHCN served are age 5 -13 years (46%), age 1 -4 years (21%), birth to 364 days (16%), age 14 -19 years (15%), and those over age 20 (2%) . Nearly 99% served are docu mented to have insurance, of which 65% are enrolled in a Medicaid managed care organization . Approximately 25% self -identify as Hispanic, and race data NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 38 indicates 40% white, 14% black, 4% Asian, 6% more than one 6% other, and 30% unknown . Quality assu rance is underway to reduce the number reported as unknown . All SCHS CMUs are required to assess the health care needs and insurance status of CYSHCN served . State Title V staffs, SCHS CMUs and SPSP providers, and SPAN Family Resource Specialists receive training from State agencies such as the NJ Department of Human Services, and the Department of Children and Families to become Informal Application Assistors for Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare programs as well as to learn about Managed Long Term Services and Sup ports, how to obtain care through the Marketplace, and behavioral services through PerformCare . These trainings build capacity among Title V agency providers to enhance access to primary and preventive care for CYSCHN . For example, an SCHS CM reported bein g able to assist a parent to problem solve a denial of home health aide services for a 12 - year-old with autism and significant developmental delays by advocating on Mom's behalf with PerformCare, her child's school district, and her Family Support Organiza tion. Repeated phone calls, home visits, and written appeals by the SCHS CM supported Mom's efforts to clarify the missing information and resolve her child's needs . Recognizing that SCHS CM and family support are valuable in assisting families of CYSHCN to access care, Title V works collaboratively with the SCHS CMUs and family support organizations, including Family WRAP. Specific Family WRAP programs include Project Care, Parent -to-Parent and Family Voices New Jersey. SPAN and SCHEIS have continued to identify/develop resources to expand the number of Family Resources Specialists (FRS) trained as support specialists to work on site at the SCHS CMUs or regionally. In addition, Title V, Early Intervention Systems, SPAN, and other community -based partners are collaborating on an AMCHP sponsored \"Learn the Signs. Act Early.\" initiative . Through collaboration with SPAN, the NJ Chapter, Academy of Pediatrics (NJAAP), SCHS CMUs, SPSP providers, and the Community of Care Consortium efforts are ongoing to impro ve access to coordinated preventive and primary care through medical home. Preventive and primary care services are in demand and most recent data indicate that in the number CYSHCN served across SPSP services increased over the past 2 years; 61,894 (SFY 2016) vs. 70,414 (SFY 2017) . Comprehensive multidisciplinary team evaluation is provided through the CECs to assess the needs of children with congenital or acquired neurodevelopmental disorders including communication, learning, and behavioral disorders . A copy of the team -based plan of care is provided to the family of the CYSCHN and/or their primary care physician of record . In SFY17, 40,253 CYSHCN were seen at the CECs for multidisciplinary evaluations including FAS, and the most frequently diagnosed co nditions include Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (27%), Autism (16%), Speech Disorders (12%), and Developmental Delays (11%) . Furthermore, more than 52,492 visits were reported . Of note, 46% CYSHCN served were enrolled in one of the Medicai d programs and less than 1% were uninsured . Access to in -state pediatric specialty and subspecialty care is further provided through NJ's Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Anomalies Centers and Tertiary Care Centers . Multidisciplinary teams ensure that patie nts receive necessary medical, nutritional, and developmental care, and that there is coordination of care with primary care providers, sub -specialists, hospitalists, and other community -based providers such as FQHCs . A total of 30,161 CYSHCN received eval uations and services through the five Craniofacial Centers and three Tertiary Centers in SFY 2017. SFY 2017, data indicate that 1,824 CYSHCN were served through the Cleft Centers, of which 60% were insured through State Medicaid program; 35% had some form of private insurance, and 2% of children's insurance status was reported as uninsured/unknown . Approximately 37% were under the age of 1 and nearly 30% were age 6 -13 years, reinforcing the need for continuation of coordinated care through school age . Coord ination with community -based dental providers including orthodontia remains a challenge, and collaboration with patients' care management organizations is helpful to resolve access . The Tertiary Centers reported over 28,337 clients served in SFY 2017, with the majority (37%) reported as age 6 -13 years . Again, these Centers of Excellence as noted in the NJ Medicaid Managed Care Contract fill a need for specialty care providers that accept Medicaid with nearly 46% served reported being enrolled in a NJ Medica id/NJ FamilyCare program, and only less than 1% were uninsured, and less than 1% paying for care on a sliding scale . Specialty services in greatest demand during that same time period include; Cardiology NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c family participation and address cultural competency, the Centers provide written informed consent guidelines for all aspects of the evaluatio n, diagnostic and/or treatment services . The confidentiality of records is protected, written procedures regarding access to records is made available to all staff, and the sharing of records is determined by the parents of CYSHCN . Each Center maintains written procedures for parental consent for release of records . The Centers must comply with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) requirements . Limited English proficiency needs are addressed through access to foreign language interpreters and/or interpre ters for the deaf . The Centers cannot discriminate through admission policies, hiring practices, or promotional opportunities on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin, sex or handicapping conditions . CYSHCN with ongoing needs that warrant care coordin ation are linked with the SCHS CMU located in their county of residence. Through the Fee -For Service (FFS) program State Title V staffs and SCHS CMUs process requests for assistance with uncovered expenses for medically necessary services such as hearing aids, braces, orthotics, prostheses, and medications to treat asthma and cystic fibrosis . In SFY 2017, 27 CYSHCN received benefits through FFS. 100% of FFS applications are screened for NJ Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, and/or accurate interpretation of their co mmercial health coverage and are referred to their county SCHS CMU for supports . The demand for assistance to purchase hearing aids for youth age 18 -21 has gradually increased . NJ's Grace's Law and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have improved coverage, an example being that hearing aid coverage is now considered an essential health benefit . Some families continue to experience gaps in coverage and require assistance through FFS, for example, those with grandfathered plans, certain employer -sponsored plans, a nd those ineligible for State programs due to residency have found that some challenges remain . Likewise, challenges continue for CYSCHN, families, and providers, in understanding insurance benefits and how to use them, particularly for families with limited English proficiency . Title V staffs, the SCHS CMUs, and SPAN Family Resource Specialists are instrumental in assisting CYSCHN to understand and use their coverage . For example, with the implementation of Grace's Law in 2008, certain health benefit plans were mandated to provide limited coverage of $1,000 per hearing aid for children 15 years and younger every 24 months . Subsequently, the ACA prohibited annual or lifetime benefit limits on essential health benefits . Consequently, the inclusion of hearing aids as an essential health benefit is a strength for families of CYSHCN; however, the NJ specific $1,000 benefit limit no longer applies . This change presents the potential for an increase in out-of-pocket expenses for some CYSHCN, and challenges for hear ing aid dispensers to renegotiate reimbursement with insurance carriers . To that end, State Title V staffs, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Audiologist, and SCHS CM's provide technical assistance to applicants, providers, insurance providers, and Human Resource departments as needed. Furthermore, SCHS is developing a Hearing Aid Vendor Survey as a Continuing Quality Improvement project aimed to structure an educational webinar for vendors. A priority for SCHEIS is ensuring rehabilitative services for blind and disabled individuals less than 16 years old receiving services under Title XIX . Historically, SCHEIS has addressed the early identification, outreach to and the support of that special needs population through follow -up of CYSHCN by the SCHS CMUs . Typically, CYSHCN age birth to 21 years of age are identified to the SCHS CMUs in the county in which the CYSHCN resides through the BDARS and the CICRF; by community, family and self -referrals; and through the Department of Human Services t ransmittal of Social Security Administration's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) data provided via the State Data Exchange. The SSI transmittal is electronic and enables the NJDOH to conduct monthly uploads of county -specific reports which are then viewa ble by the SCHS CMUs through the NJDOH's secured web access. The SCHS CMUs outreach to all CYSHCN referred by SSI to screen CYSCHN for need and/or eligibility for the services through the Fee for Service program; offer information and referral; development of an ISP; case management services as needed; linkage with community -based primary and pediatric specialty care, transition to adulthood, family support and social service supports across local, State, and federal programs . With electronic access to thei r county -specific reports, the SCHS CMUs manage their workflow . In addition, receiving the data electronically has enabled SCHEIS to more accurately track the NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 40 numbers of CYSHCN referred and served . State FCCS staffs monitor the transmittal and follow -up of SSI referrals by the SCHS CMUs, and status of follow -up has been included as an indicator on the SCHS CMU evaluation tool. 3.E.2.b.2. Family Partnership Building the capacity of women, children and youth, including those with special health care needs, and families to partner in decision making with Title V programs at the federal, state and community levels is a critical strategy in helping NJ to achieve its MCH outcomes . FHS has several initiatives to build and strengthen family/consumer partnerships for all MCH populations, to assure cultural and linguistic competence and to promote health equity in the work of NJ's Title V program . Efforts to support Family/Consumer Partnerships, including family/consumer engagement , are in the following strategies and activities: Advisory Committees; Strategic and Program Planning; Quality Improvement; Workforce Development; Block Grant Development and R eview; Materials Development; and Advocacy. This section summarizes the relevant family/consumer and organizational relationships which serve the MCH populations and expand the capacity and reach of the state Title V MCH and C YSHCN programs. Table 1f - MCH Organizational Relationships with Partnerships, Collaboration, and Cross -Program Coordination (See Supporting Document #1) summarizes the partnerships, collaborations, and cross - program coordination established by the state Title V program with pu blic and private sector entities; federal, state and local government programs; families/consumers; primary care associations; tertiary care facilities; academia; and other primary and public health organizations across the state that address the priority needs of the MCH population but are not funded by the state Title V program. The public health issues affecting MCH outcomes generally affect low -income and minority populat ions disproportionately and is influenced by the physical, social and economic en vironments in which people live. To address these complex health issues effectively, FHS/Title V program recognizes that a spectrum of strategies to build community capacity and promote community health must include parents and consumers representing the a ffected populations as integral partners in all activities in order to have full community engagement and successful programs. In order to carry out these functions and address t he public health disparities affecting NJs maternal child health population, FHS/Title V program has incorporated consumer/family involvement in as many programs and activities as appropriate. NJ has prided itself on its regional MCH services and program s, which have been provided through the Maternal Child Health Consortia (MCHC), an established regionalized network of maternal and child health providers with emphasis on prevention and community -based activities . Partially funded by FHS, the MCHC are cha rged with developing regional perinatal and pediatric plans, total quality improvement systems, professional and consumer education, transport systems, data analysis, and infant follow -up programs . The three MCHC are located in the northern, central and so uthern regions of the state. It is a requirement of the statute governing the MCHC that 50% of their Board of Directors be comprised of consumers representing the diverse population groups being serviced by their organizations . Recognizing the importance that parent/consumer involvement has in the design and implementation of a program to address issues related to preterm births and infant mortality, the MCH Program incorporated parent/consumer involvement into an FHS major initiative, the Improving Pregn ancy Outcomes Project (IPO), which requires grantees to have a Consumer Advisory Council to help guide the program, assist with the evaluation and quality improvement initiatives as well as the design and development of all educational/information material s. Similarly, the Home Visitation Program (MIEC -HV) also requires funded grantees to implement Consumer Advisory Work Groups. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 41 The NJ Title V CYSHCN Program, also referred to as Special Child Health and Early Intervention Services (SCHEIS), partners, coll aborates, and coordinates with many different governmental and nongovernmental entities, on federal, state, and local levels, as well as parents, families and caregivers, primary care physicians, specialists, other health care providers, hospitals, advocac y organizations, and many others to facilitate access to coordinated, comprehensive, culturally competent care for CYSHCN . SCHEIS works with programs within the NJ Departments of Human Services (DHS) and Children and Families (DCF) in addressing many needs facing CYSHCN including medical, dental, developmental, rehabilitative, mental health, and social services . DHS administers Title XIX and Title XX services and provides critical supports for ensuring access to early periodic screening detection and treatm ent for CYSHCN . The State DHS Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) NJ FamilyCare Program, and the Division of Disability Services afford eligible children comprehensive health insurance coverage to access primary, spec ialty, and home health care that CYSHCN and their families need. SCHEIS utilizes patient satisfaction survey as a means to improve and refine . All trainings provided to grantees are also open to parents/consumers as either participants or speakers . All CYSHCNs educational materials and informational brochures receive input and are reviewed by parents/consumers for health literacy and cultural competence. SCHEIS collaborates with many offices and programs in DHS to develop and implement policy that will ensure that children referred into the SCHS CMUs and their families are screened appropriately for healthcare service entitlements and waivered services . SCHEIS programs including case management, specialized pediatrics, and Ryan White Part D, screen all r eferrals for insurance and potential eligibility for Medicaid programs, counsel referrals on how to access Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, Advantage, and waiver programs, and link families with their county -based Boards of Social Services and Medicaid Assistance Customer Care Centers . Program data including insurance status is collected into a report that is compared with Medicaid data in determining CYSHCN need . Referrals are made to Boards of Social Services, NJ Family Care, Advantage, Charity Care, Department o f Banking and Insurance, and Disability Rights NJ for support and advocacy . The Early Hearing Detection and Identification (EHDI) program within the SCHEIS also recognizes the pivotal role that consumers and parents play in the effective administration o f the program . EHDI has an Advisory Council composed of parents of Deaf and hard of hearing children and consumers who themselves are Deaf or hard of hearing . Participants on the council take part in literature reviews, advise the NJDOH regarding innovations in the programmatic area and assist in the review of operations of the program. Collaboration between SCHEIS staff, SCHS CM Us and SPSP and the DHS, Division of Family Development (DFD) is essential in coordinating access to care and social ser vices for many of NJ's most vulnerable CYSHCN and their families . The primary tasks of DFD include directing NJ's welfare program, Work First NJ (WFNJ), and providing funding, information management services, and administrative support to the county and/or municipal welfare departments that implement the federally funded Food Stamps food assistance program . The DFD also oversees child care licensing, Kinship supports for families, and child support . The federal SSI benefit program for aged, blind or disabled individuals is also supplemented by DFD . WFNJ recipients who may be eligible for federal SSI benefits can now get free legal help. The DFD has established an agreement with Legal Services of NJ (LSNJ) to assist recipients in either filing for SSI benefits or appealing a denial of benefits. The DHS Division of Disabilities Services (DDS) and SCHEIS collaborate to promote and facilitate independence and participation for people with disabilities in all aspects of community life . Through its system of Info rmation and Referral (I&R), the DDS supports active information exchange regarding community services and fosters coordination and cooperation among government and community -based agencies . The I&R Specialists commonly refer families of CYS HCN to the SCHEI S CECs, Tertiary Cleft Lip/Palate and Craniofacial Anomalies Centers; SCHS CM Us and family supports . In addition, SCHEIS refers families to the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Fund, TBI Waiver and Personal Preference: NJ Cash and Counseling P rogram; and the Medicaid Personal Care Assistant (PCA) NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 42 services . The SCHEIS regularly uses these DDS resources to assist families of CYSHCN to find health and transition to adulthood supports . In operation for over 20 years, the Catastrophic Illness in C hildren Relief Fund (CICRF) Commission administers a financial assistance program for NJ families whose children have an illness or condition otherwise not fully covered by insurance, State or Federal programs, or other source . By legislative mandate, SCHE IS participates on the CICRF Commission. The NJ Council on Developmental Disabilities (NJ CDD) functions in accordance with the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, and in NJ State government by N.J.S.A. 30:1AA 1.2 and is codified in Title 10 of the State Administrative Codes . According to State statute the Title V agency has a seat on the NJ CDD . The purpose of the NJ CDD is to engage in advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change that contribute to a coordinated, co nsumer and family -centered, consumer and family -directed comprehensive system that includes needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self -determination for individuals with developmental disabilities an d their families. In accordance with the 1993 Family Support Act the NJ CDD established the Regional Family Support Planning Councils (RFSPCs) to provide a way for parents and family members of people with developmental disabilities to come together to e xchange knowledge and information about family support services and to advocate for families and individuals with developmental disabilities at the local and state level on issues that directly impact their lives . They also collaborate with the state Divis ion of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) on how to better serve individuals and their families . The Medical Assistance Advisory Committee (MAAC) operates pursuant to 42 CFR 446.10 of the Social Security Act . The 15 -member Committee is comprised of governmental, advocacy, and family representatives and is responsible for analyzing and developing programs of medical care and coordination . State SCHEIS staffs participate at MAAC meetings and share information on access to care through Medicaid managed care with Committee members as well as with SCHEIS programs . Likewise, information shared by the MAAC is incorporated into SCHEIS program planning to better assure coordination of resources, services, and supports for CYSHCN across systems . The quarterly M AAC meetings continue to provide a public forum for the discussion of systems changes in DHS's Medicaid program as well as invite collaboration across State programs . Updates keep stakeholders including the public and providers informed of NJ's progress in implementation of Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS ), and the restructuring of services to children and youth with the developmental disabilities through DDD, DCF, DOE and DOL, Vocational Rehabilitation . The Statewide Parent Advocacy Networ k (SPAN) , now called SPAN Parent Advocacy Network , and the NJAAP are key partners with the Title V Program in NJ in many initiatives and projects to better serve CYSHCN and empower families . The Statewide Community of Care Consortium (COCC) , a leadership group of SPAN, dedicated to improving NJ's performance on the six core outcomes for CYSHCN and their families, includes three co -conveners from Title V, SPAN and NJAAP. This group also includes DHS, DCF, the NJ Primary Care Association, and over 60 statewid e participating stakeholder organizations . The COCC partners are continuing to work to improve the access of children with mental health challenges to needed care, and to improve the capacity of primary care providers to address mental health issues within their practice . A Family Guide to Integrating Mental Health and Pediatric Primary Care has been developed and shared with families. COCC co-conveners continue to meet with NJ's child protection agency, DCF Division of Protection and Child Permanency, abou t addressing challenges for children with mental health needs under their care . As an organization consisting of parents or families of CYSHCN, SPAN's guides, publications and presentations are consistently developed, by design, with family and consumer in volvement. Collaboration with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development ensures access to programs such as Vocational Rehabilitation, Social Security Disability Determination, Temporary Disability Insurance, and Workers Compensation . The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) Services is responsible for training and placement of persons of employable age wit h disabilities . As SCHEIS NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 43 counse ls families on transition to adulthood planning options, programs regularly refer to DVR . Likewise, DVR st affs collaborate with SCHEIS programs on family and provider training, individual service plan, and individualized education plan development . Childcare is a need for CYSHCN, and SCHEIS collaborates with MAPS to Inclusive Child Care Training and Technical Assistance Project, Healthy Start programs (all have Parent/Consumer Advisory Boards) , as well as the MCH Adolescent Health unit . The goals of the project are to increase the quality of early care and education for children with special needs; in crease the number of child care providers that offer inclusive child care; increase awareness among parents, child care providers ,and child care resource and referral agencies of the services available for children with special needs; and improve the de livery of services for children with special needs through collaboration among providers of child care services and special needs services . Its focus remains planning to develop strategies that facilitate and enhance the inclusion of CYSHCN in child care s ettings. Title V works with many different partners to help ensure NJ is on the cutting edge with newborn screening policies and operations in NJ . The Newborn Screening Advisory Review Committee (NSARC), established by Executive Order from the Commission er includes parents, primary care physicians, specialists, nurses, health care organization representatives, including those from Medicaid and private health plans, advocacy organizations, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetr icians and Gynecologists, the Centers for Disease Control . SCHEIS works with many federal partners and other state/territory colleagues to share and gain information on services and initiatives for CYSHCN . In March and May of 2015, SCHEIS participated in technical assistance calls arranged through HRSA's MCHB to share information on NJ's critical congenital heart defects screening program and the Autism Registry respectively . In May 2012, NJ was one of six states to receive a 3 -year HRSA -funded demonst ration grant for pulse oximetry screening to detect critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) . NJ was the first state in the nation to implement mandatory screening, and a number of infants have been detected through this screening that might otherwise have been discharged from the hospital without detection . Implementation of screening has been a collaborative effort with representation from the NJ Chapter, AAP (NJAAP), the NJ NICU Collaborative and SPAN on the NJDOH CCHD Screening Working Group . In additio n, the grant has enabled us to continue extensive educational and training efforts throughout the state with a sub -grant to NJAAP . School health coordination and collaboration is accomplished statewide through funding to three regional WSCC School Health regional grantee agencies, each with a seven -county service area . Through a mini - grant opportunity developed in SFY 2014 and implemented in SFY 2015 -2018 the regional grantees and Adolescent Health State staff worked with various advisory \"experts\" from s tate government or professional statewide organizations to develop evidence -based or best practice actions in each component of the CDC model . In addition to schools, parent and youth engagement are key strategic approaches utilized in the WSCC School Heal th NJ Project. The NJ Statewide Network for Cultural Competence (NJSNCC) began in 2002 as an initiative of the NJ DOH FHS Title V program to improve culturally competent policies, procedures and practices through participation in a technical assistance project developed by the National Center for Cultural Competence at Georgetown University. Upon completion of the project, participants decided to work together to develop a broad -based network to advance culturally competent practices in NJ. Early milesto nes included the development of a listserv and resource directory in 2003, and the launch of a website in 2005. The NJSNCC has held four (46) statewide annual co nferences in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2015, 2016, and 2017 and is in the process of planning for a nother one in the Fall of 2016late Fall of 2018. NJSNCC initiated the first of its webinars in 2015, and ha s held webinars on a quarterly basis. The agencies and organizations involved in the Network include more than 130 public/non -profit State, community and private sector agencies engaged in or promoting culturally and linguistically competent service delivery, education, policies and practices . The goals are to: identify existing resources in NJ; i.e. agencies and individuals who have knowledg e and skills working with people from diverse needs, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 44 cultures, languages or population groups; foster professional development and education; stimulate, promote and celebrate the development and dissemination of best and promising practices in culturally and linguistically competent service delivery . Objectives are to promote knowledge, dissemination, exchange and application of culturally and linguistically competent practices; demonstrate that such practices increase access; improve quality of care, servi ces, and outcomes; reduce disparities and foster health equity; share policy and practice guidelines in culturally and linguistically competent service delivery; collect, compile and share resource information on programs and services that are culturally a nd linguistically competent; provide a statewide resource tool/guide for accessing culturally and linguistically competent services to individuals and families with diverse needs; and, identify key stakeholders and constituencies and opportunities for affi liations and future collaborative activities. As evidenced by the multitude of advisory council, consumer groups, coalitions, interdepartmental work groups, and committees, the NJDOH places a gre at emphasis on the active and meaningful participation of parents and consumers in the development, design and implementation and evaluation of Title V programs . This is a core strength of the NJDOH Title V programs.NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT 2019 NARRAT IVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT FIVE -YEAR STATE ACTION PLAN NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 45 3.E.2.b.3. States Systems Development and Other MCH Data Capacity Efforts 3.E.2.b.4. Health Care Delivery System National health care reform has been one of many changes impacting the role of FHS as NJs Title V agency . FHS has positioned itself to play an important role in health systems d evelopment and transformation . FHS had long ago shifted from a direct service delivery orientation to a preventive, population -based assurance role that could be responsive to new national programs and policies and the changing economic climate. The Affor dable Care Act has significantly reduced barriers to accessing care for residents of NJ. MCH grantees, stakeholders and partners typically refer uninsured pregnant women, women of childbearing age, children and adolescents to resources to access primary, p reventive and reproductive health care services . While there is no way to identify the exact number of residents who the MCH Block Grant serves that have gained insurance coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, it is clear t hat the collective work of MCH grantees, stakeholders and partners has yielded great returns when we examine NJ's overall insurance and Medicaid enrollment estimates since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. NJ's uninsured rate was reduced from 15.0% in 2013 to 1 0.7% in 201 6, the lowest in decades . The Affordable Care Act has helped more than 800,000 additional NJ residents obtain insurance between 2013 and 2016 ; 500,000 through the expansion of Medicaid, or FamilyCare, and another 300,000 throu gh marketplace policies. Although the Affordable Care Act has clearly made a difference relative to access to care for a large number of residents of NJ, there are populations that have not directly benefitted from the law . Most notable among this populat ion is undocumented residents . However, NJ does have programs that meet the needs of this at -risk population . Through the State funded Uncompensated Care Fund, NJ reimburses 20 licensed federally qualified health centers with over 110 sites throughout the State (covering all 21 counties) for medical and dental care services provided to the uninsured . Among this population are women who would otherwise receive cover age for prenatal care services through a Medicaid Waiver program for pregnant undocumented women . The Medicaid waiver program has limited funds and once its funds have been exhausted, the population is automatically referred to the federally qualified heal th centers for necessary services . Through these collective efforts, MCH grantees, stakeholders, partners and other State Executive Branch agencies have had an impact on meeting the ongoing needs of MCH populations that remain uninsured despite the impleme ntation of the Affordable Care Act. As evidence of NJ's strong partnership with HRSA and the MCH Bureau, the State has consistently provided funding for the Uncompensated Care Fund . In SFY 2017, the FQHC -Uncompensated Care Fund was funded at $28 million . In SFY2017, the FQHCs served a total of 180,303 uninsured/underinsured residents and 490,420 uninsured/underinsured visits were reimbursed . In SFY 2018, the FQHC -Uncompensated Care Fund was funded at $30 million. In NJ, health care is beginning the transi tion to move out of hospitals and into outpatient settings through the Accountable Care Organizations and the new Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program . The NJDOH has allocated $166.6 million in hospital funding, approved by the Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services, to the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program . The DSRIP Program is one component of the NJ's Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver as approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) . DSRIP is a demonstr ation program designed to result in better care for individuals (including access to care, quality of care, health outcomes), better health for the population, and lower costs by transitioning hospital funding to a model where payment is contingent on achieving health improvement goals . Hospitals may qualify to receive incentive payments for implementing quality initiatives within their community and achieving measurable, incremental clinical outcome results demonstrating the initiatives' impact on improvin g the NJ health care system. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 46 The DSRIP program supports the Healthy NJ 2020 vision: \"For New Jersey to be a state in which all people live long, healthy lives.\" This innovative program reward s hospitals with funding to improve quality of care by facilitating and providing home bound services, and reducing the number of re -hospitalizations for the conditions the participating hospitals have chosen to address . These conditions include obesity, diabetes, asthma, cardiac care, chemical addiction and behavioral health . FHS/Title V staffs have been collaborating with the NJDOH/DSRIP staffs and Department of Human Services , Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (Medicaid) in the design and implementation of the program to assure that MCH population needs are addressed . FHS staffs and grantees also have been working in collaboration with the NJ Department of Human Services /Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services as they reviewed and certified three Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for the cities of Newark , Trenton and Camden. The Healthy Greater Newark ACO will serve three zip codes within the city of Newark where the need for health care services is high. These zip code areas have been found to have a significant number of people who experience higher r ates of emergency room visits and a greater rate of hospital admissions than those living in other parts of the city. Not only will the ACO improve access to care, it will provide supportive services to people in their homes and in the community. This will have a significant impact in reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits that place enormous burdens on the patients themselves and the area hospitals. The Healthy Greater Newark ACO as part of their needs assessment findings will foc us on improving care for chronically ill children, as well as enhancing perinatal and maternal health services . FHS is utilizing this opportunity to help strengthen availability and access to primary care for the families and children we serve by joining i n a coordinated effort to provide quality care primarily in high need areas such as the city of Newark. Trenton Health Team (THT) and the Camden Coalition of Health Care Providers were also approved by the State to form a Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO) to serve the Trenton and Ca mden community as part of a three -year demonstration project utilizing a three -part goal of improving health outcomes, lowering healthcare cost and improving the patient's experience of receiving care. THT's and the Camden Coalition Medicaid ACO will achie ve those goals through continuing and expanding upon collaborating with the community at large, health and social services organization and the Departments of Health, Human Services and Children and Families . FHS will continue to collaborate with these three ACOs to ensure that our MCH population needs are being addressed.

The selection of NPM #1 (Well Women Visits) during the Five -Year Needs Assessment process recognizes the impact the life course approach will have on Increasing Health Births and improving women's health across the life span . The Life Course Perspective to conceptualizing health care needs and services evolved from research documenting the important role early life events play in shaping an individual's health trajectory . The interplay of risk and protective factors, such as socioeconomic stat us, toxic environmental exposures, health behaviors, stress, and nutrition, influence health throughout one's lifetime . NJ has had a long-standing emphasis on improving Women's Health and has promoted several evidence -based strategies to increase preventiv e medical visits (NPM #1) including: the Improving Pregnancy Outcome Initiative , IM CoIIN, MIEC Home Visiting , Fetal Infant Mortality Review, and Maternal Mortality Revie w. Plan for the Application Year - NPM #1 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Percent of women with a past year preventive medical visit 72.9 72.5 73.6 74.8 75.5 Data Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in EHB . Plans for the coming year to promote NPM 1 (Well Women Care) will include the recommendations of the IM CoIIN regarding postpartum visits . The IPO Initiative with Central Intake Hubs and Community Health Workers will promote the outreach and referral of women for preventive medical visits through standardized Community Health Screenings and referrals to medical care providers . The MIEC Home Visiting Programs and Healthy Start Programs will continue to case manage mothers and assure preventive medical visits through the monitoring of benchmarks which include a reproductive life plan, medical home and well women vi sits. In 2018, a new Request For Proposals (RFP) for the Healthy Women Healthy Families Initiative will be issued to include a specific focus on reducing black infant mortality in certain NJ municipalities. Annual Report - NPM #1 (Percent of women with a past year preventive medical visit) The Improving Pregnancy Outcomes (IPO) Initiative through the use of Community Health Workers and Central Intake Hubs has been focused on improv ing maternal and infant health outcomes including women's health with pr eventive medical visits, preconception care, prenatal care, interconception care, preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality . This has been coordinated with existing federal and state -funded initiatives including Healthy Start, Maternal Infant a nd Early Childhood Home Visitation, Strong Start, Title X Family Planning, Childhood Lead Exposure Prevention and Healthy Homes, Perinatal Addictions Prevention, Postpartum Mood Disorders, Coordinated School Health, WIC, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and the activities of the Office of Community Health and Wellness (smoking, diabetes, cardiac, cancer, ob esity prevention, physical fitness, hypertension). Through use of Community Health Workers and Central Intake the IPO Initiative target ed limited public health resources to populations and communities with the highest need where impact will be greatest to improve population health outcomes and reduce health disparities . The IPO Initiative is work ing to improve women's health by completing s tandardized Community Health Screenings for participating women including the assessment of health insurance , existing medical conditions , mental health needs, and social service needs . The newly designed HWHF Initiative will address the disparities in bir th NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 48 outcomes through case management and will assure that appropriate referrals are made and tracked including medical care referrals to promote NPM #1 (Well Women Visits). Evidence -Based Informed Strategy Measure ( ESM ) 1.1 (Increase First Trimester Prenat al Care) was selected for its positive impact on National Performance Measure ( NPM ) #1 (Well Women Care) and State Performance Measure (SPM) #1 (Increasing Healthy Births). NJDOH participated in the Infant Mortality Collaborative Improvement and Innovatio n Networks (IM CoIIN) sponsored by the MCH Bureau with technical assistance from National Institute for Children's Health Quality . The IM CoIIN State Team from NJ identified two priority areas - improving maternal postpartum visit rates and smoking cessation . The HWHF Initiative will coordinate and collaborate with a variety of community partners to implement the IM CoIIN recommendations from these two focus areas. Included in improving NPM #1 is a focus on preconception care and early prenatal care . Improving access to prenatal care is essential to promoting the health of NJ mothers, infants, and families. Early and adequate prenatal care is an important component for a healthy pregnancy and birth outcome because it offers the best opportunity for r isk assessment, health education, and the management of pregnancy - related complications and conditions . Prenatal care is also an opportunity to establish contacts with the health care system and to provide general preventive visits . Efforts to improve access to early prenatal care must address the factors related to unintended pregnancy and lack of early pregnancy awareness by focusing on women before they become pregnant. Preconception care is a critical component of prenatal care and health care for a ll women of reproductive age. The main goal of preconception care is to provide health promotion, screening and interventions for women of reproductive age to reduce risk factors that might affect future pregnancies. Given the relationship between pregnanc y intention and early initiation of prenatal care, assisting women in having a healthy and planned pregnancy can reduce the incidence of late prenatal care and promote NPM #1 (Well Women Visits). Through its collaboration with the NJDOH Office of Populati on Health and the Population Health in Action Teams, FHS will be establishing linkages with sister agencies (Department of Labor, Department of Education, Department of Transportation, etc.) to address some of the barriers that exist in the scope of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The regional quality improvement activities within each of the three Maternal Child Health Consortia (MCHCs) coordinated by RPHS include the regular monitoring of indicators of perinatal and pediatric statistics, fetal -infant mortality review, maternal mortality review, and maternity services reporting through the Vital Information Platform (VIP). Regional quality improvement activities include regular monitoring of indicators of perinatal and pediatric statistics and pathol ogy, including 1) transports with death; 2) non - compliance with rules regarding birth weight and gestational age; 3) cases in which no prenatal care was received; 4) all maternal deaths; 5) all fetal deaths over 2,500 grams not diagnosed as having known lethal anomalies; 6) selected pediatric deaths and/or adverse outcomes; 7) immunizations of children 2 years of age; and 8) admissions for ambulatory care sensitive diagnoses in children. Quality improvement is accomplished through Fetal-Infant Mortality Review and Maternal Mortality Review systems, as well as analyzing data collected through electronically submitted birth certificates . The TQI Committee reviews the data and makes recommendations to address either provider specific issues or broad system iss ues that address multiple providers or consumer groups within each Consortium region .

Perinatal/Infant Health The domain of Perinatal/Infant Health sets the trajectory of the health of a child throughout the Life Course. NJDOH has identified the State Priority Need (SPN) of Reducing Black Infant Mortality and selected the related NPMs 4 (Breastfeeding) and 5 (Infant Safe Sleep) as a result of the Five -Year Needs Assessment process. NJ has implemented several evidence -based strategies related to NPM 4 & 5 which in turn will impact on several NOMs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 9.5). Evidence -based strategies related to NPM 4 & 5 are listed in the Logic Model. Plan for the Application Year - NPM 4: A) Percent of infants who are ever breastfed and B) Percent of infants breastfed exclusively through 6 months Promoting breastfeeding has been a long -standing priority for FHS. Breastfeeding is universally accepted as the optimal way to nourish and nurture infants, and it is recommended that infants be exclusively breastfed for the first six months. Breastfeeding is a cost -effective preventive intervention with far - reaching effects for mothers and babies and significant cost savings for families, health providers, employers and the government. Breastfeed ing provides biologically normal, appropriate nutrition and encourages normal, infant development; lack of breastfeeding increases the risk of disease and obesity . FHS has developed many strong partnerships to strengthen breastfeeding -related hospital regu lations, promoting breastfeeding education, training and community support. The Healthy People 2020 breastfeeding objectives are for 81.9% of mothers to initiate breastfeeding, for 60.6% of new mothers to continue breastfeeding until their infants are six months old, for 34.1% to breastfeed until one year, for 46.2% to exclusively breastfeed through three months, and for 25.5% to breastfeed exclusively through six months. In the 2016 Breastfeeding Report Card from the CDC, 82.0% of NJ newborns were ever and NPM #4 Table NPM #4 Born in 2007 Born in 2008 Born in 2009 Born in 2010 Born in 2011 Born in 2012 Born in 2013 Born in 2014 Percent of infan ts through 6 months 10.0 11.8 14.0 13.0 22.3 16.7 23.1 24.8 Notes - Source - the CDC's National Immunization Survey. http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/NIS_data/ Efforts to promote Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) designation through training, technical assistance, and mini -grants will continue t o promote NPM 4A & B. The 11th NJ hospitals to earn the \"Baby -Friendly\" designation was Chilton Medical Center in February 2018. Surveillance through the Birth Certificate file and the mPINC survey will continue to identify areas of potential improvement. The selection of ESM 4.1 (Increase Births in Baby Friendly Hospitals) will monitor progress on promoting breastfeeding policies and practices in hospitals which should lead to an increase in NPM #4 (Breastfeeding). Many hospitals employ International Boa rd Certified Lactation Consultants who provide early support and information to breastfeeding mothers. WIC's 2018 Strategic Plan includes supporting the NJ Breastfeeding Coalition (NJBC) by exploring funding sources and collaborating on State -wide goals wi th of community involvement. This collaboration begins an inclusive process to address the disparities that exists in breastfeeding which is a priority of the Department of Health. Workgroups from across FHS were created to pool expertise t o comprehensivel y address BIM. WIC will continue to provide breastfeeding NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 50 promotion and support services to pregnant and breastfeeding women who participate in the Program. The CDC State Public Health Actions Grant will continue with webinars and technical assistance call s to the 18 participating hospitals. Existing FHS programs that promote breastfeeding and include performance measures for increasing breastfeeding include the IPO Initiative and the MIEC Home Visiting Program which now serve all 21 counties and target hi gh-need communities . With the new HWHF initiative and its focus on addressing BIM rates, programs to support breastfeeding among Black, NH, women will be made available in targeted municipalities. A Breastfeeding indicator, increase over time in the propor tion of mothers who breastfeed their 6 -week -old infants, is included in the MIECHV and Healthy Start performance benchmarks . Plan for the Application Year - NPM 5 : (Percent of infants placed to sleep on their backs ) Promoting infant safe sleep was selected as NPM #5 during the Five -Year Needs Assessment process for its importance in reducing preventable infant deaths and its potential impact on improving NOM s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Sleep -related infant deaths, also called Sudden Unexpected Infant Dea ths (SUID), are the leading cause of infant death after the first month of life and the third leading cause of infant death overall. Sleep -related SUIDs include Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed and unknow n causes . Due to the heightened risk of SIDS when infants are placed to sleep on side or stomach sleep positions, health experts and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP) have long recommended the back sleep position. In 2011, AAP expanded its recommend ations to help reduce the risk of all sleep -related deaths through a safe sleep environment that includes use of the back - sleep position, on a separate firm sleep surface (room -sharing without bed sharing), and without loose bedding. Additional higher -level recommendations include breastfeeding and avoiding smoke exposure during pregnancy and after birth. These expanded recommendations have formed the basis of the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Safe to Sleep Campaign. The select ion of ESM 5.1 (Promote Infant Safe Sleep Environments ) will monitor and focus attention on the complete safe sleep environment (Healthy Sleep) including back to sleep, no co -sleeping, and no soft bedding. Table NPM #5 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Percent of infants placed to sleep on their backs 61.8 65.6 65.7 67.4 68.9 70.1 69.5 70.8 - Source - NJ PRAMS. https://www26.state.nj.us/doh -shad/query/selection/prams/PRAMSSelection.html Plans for the coming year to promote safe infant sleep include continued safe sleep education through the SIDS Center of NJ (SCNJ), MIEC Home Visiting Program and prevention act ivities of the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Review ( SUID -CR) grant . The SUID -CR Coordinator will be participating in the Infant Mortality CoIIN sessions that focus on improving infant safe sleep practices . Evidence -based strategies proposed by the IM CoIIN sessions on infant safe sleep will be consid ered by the SUID -CR Workgroup. Staff from the MIEC Home Visiting Program have all been trained by the SCNJ and will promote the infant safe slee p message during their visits to over 7,000 families annually in NJ. The SIDS Center of New Jersey (SCNJ) educates hospital nurses by providing its on -site program, Nurse s LEAD the Way, by presenting at regional nursing co nferences, and by communicating through other venues such as listservs. In addition to providing information, SCNJ presentations offer model hospital policies, scripts for educating parents and addressing potential barriers to compliance, and educational materials in electronic and hard c opy, using content developed by SCNJ and by the NICHD NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 51 Safe to Sleep Campaign. Many of the SCNJ resources, including checklists and videos, a so -called Hospital Tool Kit, can be accessed from the SCNJ website (www.rwjms.rutgers.edu/sids). In 2018 to make hospital efforts easier to carry out, SCNJ developed a cost -free, education al app, in English and Spanish (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/s ids-info/id1355933710?mt=8 ). This app provide s nurses with a visual, oral and interactive tool to help them share the information with families. Each screen contains a short text, visual example, and oral statement by a maternal voice. By tapping on a \"baby\" icon on each screen, additional details are provided in a \"young\" and engaging voice. The menu provides nurses w ith tools to support their own knowledge, such as the AAP policy, the SCNJ flyers, and the website for the national Safe to Sleep Campaign. Importantly, nurses will be asked to assist families download this free resource to their cel l phones for future ref erence. Funding for this app was derived from a health services grant from the NJ Department of Health to the SCNJ . Through grant funding from NJDOH , the SCNJ provides public health interventions such as its work with birthing hospitals, as part of the Nurses LEAD the Way initiative, and with local offices of the Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Based on the most recently released data from the NJ Center for Vital Statistics, NJ has one of the lowest SIDS rates and the lowest SUID rate in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in factors that raise the risk of SIDS, and these contr ibute to disparities in rates. Such factors include disparities in preterm births, access to care, poverty, an important association, and exposure to secon d-hand smoke, a major contributing factor ris ing to the level of causality. The SCNJ is focusing on racial and ethnic disparities in factor that raise the risk of SIDS . This is being accomplished by the SCNJ collaborating with Mom's Quit Connection to link public health messages. Plan for the Application Year SPM 1: (The percentage of Black non -Hispanic preterm births in NJ ) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Annual Indicator 15.9 15.0 14.5 14.0 13.2 13.0 12.7 12.8 Certificate data from the SHAD system https://www26.state.nj.us/doh -shad/home/Welcome.html See Chart 5 Low Birthweight by Race/Ethnicity attached as Supporting Document #3 . The selection of SPM #1 (The percentage of Black non -Hispanic preterm births in NJ) during the Five - Year Needs Assessm ent process recognizes the persistence of racial/ethnic disparities in healthy birth outcomes in NJ. Infants who are born preterm are at the highest risk for infant mortality and morbidity . The percentage of black preterm births was selected to begin to ad dress the underlying causes of black infant mortality and the racial disparity between preterm birth rates . Maternal and Child Health Services has a long history of addressing perinatal health disparities with special emphasis on the Black Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative which was initiated in 1985. In February 2008 a Commissioner's Prenatal Care Task Forc e was convened to make recommendations to improve access to prenatal care in NJ. Health disparities was identified as a priority . The overall goal of the Access to Prenatal Care Initiative was to increase the rate of first trimester prenatal care in NJ to at least 90% to coincide with the National Healthy People 2010 goal, with emphasis on racial and ethnic disparities. The Healthy Women Healthy Families (HWHF) Initiative will continue to develop partnerships with community -based maternal and child health providers/agencies with proven capabilities in implementing activities/interventions within a targeted community and the capability to focus on reproductive -age NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 52 women and their f amilies. The goal of the HWHF I nitiative is to improve maternal and infant hea lth outcomes for high -need women of childbearing age and their families, while reducing racial, ethnic and economic disparities in those outcomes through a collaborative coordinated community -driven approach . County -based consumer -driven advisory groups fo r the IPO Initiative and the Central Intake Hubs will meet quarterly to build partnerships and local referral systems. NJDOH will continue to partner with the March of Dimes NJ Chapter in the Healthy Babies are Worth the Wait, a program to reduce preterm births among African American women in Newark and Burlington . Annual Report - NPM 4: 4A) Percent of infants who are ever breastfed and 4B) Percent of infants breastfed exclusively through 6 months FHS has supported Baby -Friendly designation through training, technical assistance and mini -grants. The Baby -Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a global program that was launched by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund to encourage and recognize hospitals and birthing centers that offer an optimal level of care for infant feeding and mother/baby bonding . BFHI recognizes and awards birthing facilities who successfully implement the Ten Steps to Suc cessful Breastfeeding (i) and follow the International Code of Marketing of Breast -milk Substitutes (ii ). Eleven NJ hospitals have earned the \"Baby -Friendly\" designation. Two of those hospitals were recipients of a $10,000 mini -grant from FHS . With a CDC State Public Health Actions Grant #1305 , NJDOH and the NJ Hospital Association delivered webinars and technical assistance calls to 18 hospitals and held a Mother -Baby Summit for all delivery hospitals to assist them in addressing barriers to and identify ing potential solutions for implementing the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. NJ hospitals strongly participate in the Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey , which is a national survey of maternity care practices and policies conducted by the CDC every two years, beginning in 2007. In 2015 , 39 of 53 (80%) eligible hospitals participated in the mPINC Survey and the total score was 83 . NJ has been gradually increasing its mPINC score and has improved its state rank to 10 out of 53 in 2015 . Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the important benefits of and recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding rates in the 24 hours prior to hospital discharge in NJ remain low ( see Chart 9 of Support ing Document #3 ), while any breastfeeding (both exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding supplemented with formula feeding) rates continued to increase, yielding an overall increase in breastfeeding initiation rates. NJ Birth Certificate data for 201 5 shows that exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge statewide was 48.2%, while any breastfeeding (exclusive and combination feeding) was 77.0%. Breastfeeding rates on discharge (alone or in combination with supplemental formula) varied with the racial a nd ethnic composition of mothers. In 201 6 Asian non -Hispanic women were most likely to breastfeed (8 4.6%) while black non -Hispanic women were least likely to breastfeed ( 67.0). White non - Hispanic and Hispanic women initiated breastfeeding at 75. 5% and 8 2.4% respectively . The exclusive rates for 201 6 were 45.5% for white non -Hispanic women, 31.3% for Asian non -Hispanic women, 25.3% for Hispanic women, and 24.5% for Black non -Hispanic women. Th ese statistics underscore the importance of comprehensively evaluating and addressing healthcare delivery, access, culturally appropriate support and community involvement to combat disparities. Further examination of the disparity in these rates will require State leadership and information of locally available br eastfeeding promotional activities, protocols, and the cultural appropriateness of those services. WIC Services provides breastfeeding promotion and support services for WIC participants through grants to all 16 local WIC agencies. International Board Cer tified Lactation Consultants and breastfeeding peer NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 53 counselors provide direct education and support services, literature, and breastfeeding aids, which include breast pumps, breast shells and other breastfeeding aids. WIC staff conducts the Loving Support \u00a9 Through Peer Counseling Breastfeeding Program . WIC breastfeeding staff conducts professional outreach in their communities and education to healthcare providers who serve WIC participants. Existing FHS programs that promote breastfeeding and include per formance measures for increasing breastfeeding include the Improving Pregnancy Outcomes Initiative and the MIEC Home Visiting Program. In SFY 201 7, 88% of mothers with newborns participating in the MIEC Home Visiting Program had initiated breastfeeding. The newly designed Healthy Women Healthy Families Initiative will include as one of its outcomes increasing exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, in an effort to address the racial/ethnic disparity in breastfeeding rates, one of the intervention/strategy th at will be a requirement in targeted municipalities include breastfeeding support groups for Black, non -Hispanic, women. Close collaboration between Maternal and Child Health Services (MCHS), WIC Services (WIC), and the Office of Community Health and Well ness is ongoing. All three programs, in addition to the Office of Minority Health, have an interest in breastfeeding protection, promotion and support and have similar constituencies. In January 2014, the State finalized new Hospital Licensing Standards t hat require hospitals to develop and implement evidence -based written policies and procedures for obstetrics, perinatal and postpartum patient services, newborn care, the normal newborn nursery, and emergency departments that address breastfeeding and supp orting the needs of a breastfeeding mother and child from the point of entry into the facility through discharge. These Standards support the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. The NJDOH will call attention to NJ's 18.9% rate for hospitals supplement ing breastfed infants with formula before two days of life; this is above the national average of 17.1% (with a Healthy People 2020 Target of 14.2%) and ranks NJ 39 out of 52 states. The Joint Commission Perinatal Care Core Measure on Exclusive Breast Milk Feeding (PC -05a) was retired in recognition of the decision some women make to not exclusively breastfeed despite recommendations. PC -05 continues as an accountability measure that is publicly reported on The Joint Commission's Quality Check\u00ae website. Annual Report NPM #5 ( infant safe sleep To promote infant safe sleep (NPM #5) , NJDOH has supported the evidence -based strategies of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the NICHD 's Safe to Sleep Campaign, the activities of the SIDS Center of New Jersey , and the work of the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Review ( SUID -CR) Workgroup. To improve the surveillance of infant safe sleep practices, FHS conducts the PRAMS survey which includes questions on infant safe sleep and participates on the SUID -CR Workgroup. The SIDS Center of New Jersey (SCNJ) is a program funded by the NJDOH at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, a part of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick and the Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack . SCNJ was established in 1988 through the SI DS Assistance Act . The SCNJ mission is to: 1) provide public health education to reduce the risk of sudden infant death, 2) offer emotional support to bereaved families, and 3) participate in efforts to learn about possible causes of and risk factors assoc iated with sudden infant deaths , including those classified as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. SCNJ works with parents, grandparents, physicians, nurses, the child care community, hospitals, first responders, schools, social service agencies, health and edu cation programs and state, federal and national organizations to reduce infant mortality and the racial and ethnic disparities associated with it. SCNJ follows the guidelines of the AAP when providing risk reduction education . The Safe Infant Sleep guideli nes of the AAP are intended to help families reduce the risks that are associated with Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Accidental Suffocation and NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 54 Strangulation in Bed . Research conducted by the SCNJ contributed to these recommendations . Since the SCNJ was established, the rate of SIDS in NJ has been reduced by 75%. NJ has participated in the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Review (SUID -CR) Registry grant funded by the CDC since 2006 . SUID -CR activities have standardized and improved data collected at infant death scenes and promoted consistent case review, classification and reporting of SUID cases . NJ has participated in the Sudden Death Am ong Youth registry grant from the CDC since 2014 . NJDOH is represented on the multi -disciplinary SUID -CR/SDYR Review Board which meets monthly as a subcommittee of the Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board ( CFNFRB ). The SUID -CR/SDYR is staffed by the Department of Children and Families and is an important statewide surveillance system for unexpected infant deaths . The SUID -CR/SDYR makes recommendations to the statewide CFNFRB conc erning safe sleep and promotes SUID prevention activities. In November 2014 , as part of a grant from the CJ Foundation , infant safe sleep training was provided to First Responders to provide healthy infant sleep education to the people they serve . The tra ining called DOSE (Direct On Scene Education) significantly reduced the number of sleep related infant deaths in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida . After an emergency is handled and the home is identified as having a resident infant, the first responder can ask to s ee where the infant sleeps. Upon observation of the infant's sleep environment the first responder can make recommendations to improve upon the environment and provide pamphleted information to caregivers. Caregivers are likely to buy -in to the education p rovided by First Responders since they are widely regarded as heroes and experts in the field of health and safety . With grant funding the DOSE program training was provided during a conference to management level EMT and Fire personnel . The personnel that received the training, in turn, will educate their staff thus reaching a large number of people. The training was centrally located allowing for personnel from all over the state to attend . The training program addressed all risk and protective factors de veloped by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Also in 2014, the Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board (CFNFRB) in partnership with DCF's Division of Community and Family Partnerships, the NJ Departments of Education and Health, and the federal Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention conducted 3 Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) prevention activities: 1) the \"Educating today's babysitters and tomorrows parents\" which targeted adolescents, 2) the Practicing Healthy Infant Sleep Environments ( PHISE) Poster Contest and 3) the Tote Bag Giveaway. The CFNFRB held a poster contest in NJ middle schools; students were asked to create \"Healthy Sleep\" posters based on the guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics . In addition to a mon etary prize, the winning student's poster was silk -screened onto tote bags, creating \"walking billboards\" for infant \"Healthy Sleep\" awareness . 4,500 tote bags filled with educational materials on \"Healthy Sleep\" practices for infants were distributed to F ederally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Family Success Centers (FSCs) and Home Visiting (HV) Programs across the state . Specific FSCs, FQHCs and HVs have been identified based on the populations they serve and their locations. Inside the tote bags. Ther e were a children's book by Dr. John Hutton entitled, \"Sleep Baby, Safe and Snug,\" which addresses healthy sleep practices in a gentle, easily understood manner. A SleepSack: an infant sleeper - pajama with a built -in blanket and swaddling cloth, produced by Halo Innovations, Inc, and safe sleep information . The PHISE Poster Contest and Tote Bag Giveaway helped raise awareness of healthy infant sleep environments and practices among a broad swath of NJ's citizens: students, educators, healthcare providers, so cial workers, and parents. In 2015, as part of the SUID -CR grant, the SUID Sub Committee partnered with Cribs for Kids and distributed over 700 \"survival kits\" to family success centers as well as child care resource and referral centers located throughou t the state. Family success centers and child care resource and referral centers were targeted as these are locations where families regularly seek out assistance and resources. Each child care resource and referral center set up an exhibit of a safe sleep environment. Contained within the survival kits were a pack and play, Halo sleep sack, safe sleep information and age appropriate pacifiers. The SUID Sub Committee also distributed children's books by Dr. John Hutton entitled \"Sleep Baby, Safe and Snug\" to all 46 local child protection offices in both Englis h and Spanish. These books were shared with mothers of newborns and pregnant mothers to educate about safe sleep practices in an easy to understand way while also encouraging bonding between mother and child through reading. The SUID NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 55 Sub Committee also uti lized grant funds to provide public education on safe sleep practices that reduce the risk of sleep related death in infants with advertisements within NJ Transit. Throughout the state the advertisements were featured on NJ Transit buses and light rails as well as on train station platforms focusing specifically on the high incidence areas identified through SUID data. The advertisements began at the end of September 2015 and continued through the end of the year. In 2017 The SIDS Cent er of New Jersey has developed a unique and free app for Apple and android devices, in English and Spanish, with the goal of enhancing the education of parents and providers about safe infant sleep . This novel and interactive tool containing written and oral content, visuals, and a menu of additional resources gives nurses, physicians, child care specialists, case workers and other providers a new way of reviewing the information with parents. Providers are then encouraged to help families download the app to their phone as an enduring resource. Pediatricians are being asked to review the app with families at well -baby visits. Through the multiple evidence -based strategies in NJ to promote infant safe sleep and the consistent message to place infants to sleep on their backs, N PM #5 has been slowly improving from 60.6% in 200 4 to 69.4% in 201 6 according to NJ PRAMS data . The SUID rate has also declined from 0.8 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 0.3 per 1,000 in 2012 according to the NCHS . Racial and ethnic disparities in NPM 5 persist and are being addressed through more targeted educational messages using home visitor staff in DCF and the MIEC Home Visiting Program. Annual Report - SPM #1 The Department's commitment to reduce black infant mortality and preterm births has been demonstrated through the Blue Ribbon Panel on Black Infant Mortality Reduction, the Black Infant Mortality Reduction Advisory Council, the BIBS campaign, the Commissioner's Prenatal Care Task Force, the Access to Prenatal Care Initiative, the ASTHO Prematu rity Pledge, the MIECHV Program, the NGA on Improving Birth Outcomes, the IM CoIIN, and the recent Healthy Women, Healthy Families Initiative. NJDOH co-sponsored a full -day professional conference titled, Black Infant Mortality in New Jersey: Past, Presen t and Future, June 2 , 2017 in Newark, NJ. The conference included presentations by experts on racial disparities in infant mortality trends and contributing factors, and stimulated discussions amongst the diverse stakeholders, including representatives fro m the clinical, scientific and policy arenas, to identify effective interventions that can be applied locally, regionally and/or nationally. Recently, on February 27, 2018, NJDOH, in collaboration with the East Orange WIC clinic showcased an event entitled \"Black Breastfeeding: Rediscovery and Restoration of a Legacy\" which focused on in promoting breastfeeding in the black community. The event was commenced with opening remarks by Ted Green, East Orange Mayor. Tammy Murphy, First Lady of New Jersey, spoke about her charge to improve Black Infant Mortality and Shereef Elnahal, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, recommitted Black Infant Mortality as a priority to improve the well -being of women and infants. Thirteen grants were awarded in 2014 for the Community Health Worker (CHW) model . CHWs are paraprofessionals who are trusted members of the target community to whom other community members turn for a variety of social supports . The focus of the IPO Initiative is to increase the number of women receiving preconception care as well as earlier and regular prenatal care, increase parenting education, and increase the number of women and children receiving primary care and health promotion . Seven grants were awarded in 2014 for the Central I ntake model which focuses on strategic efforts to assure that the specific needs of individual and families are identified and addressed effectively within community -wide service systems . Both models will be using the Perinatal Risk Assessment (PRA) and the Community Health Screening tool . The goal of risk assessment is to prevent or treat conditions associated with poor pregnancy outcome and to assure linkage to appropriate services and resources through referral . In July 2015 CI was expanded to cover all 21 NJ counties.

Early identification of developmental disorders is critical to the well -being of children and their families. It is an integral function of the primary care medical home. The percent of children with a developmental disorder has been increasing, yet overall screening rates have remained low. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening tests begin at the nine month visit. The NJDOH will continue to participate as an interdepartmental partner active with the NJ Council for Young Children (NJCYC), the Race to the Top -Early Learning Challenge (RTTT -ELC) grant and CDC's 'Learn the Signs' NJ Team . The NJCYC, Infant Child Health Committee has established a priority of improving system connections for children and families with health care providers, community services, early interven tion, child care, home visiting to expand screening (prenatal and child development) in health care and early care and education settings . Grow NJ Kids (GNJK) a Quality Improvement Rating System (QRIS) developed for early learning programs requires the use of a \"state approved\" developmental screening at Level 2 of a 5 level rating with the expectation that 90% of high needs infants and children participating in GNJK will receive developmental screening by 2018 with an emphasis on using the parent completed child monitoring system Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ and ASQ: SE) screening tools. The MIEC Home Visiting Program will continue to promote and monitor parent completed child development screening tools (ASQ and ASQ: SE) . In SFY 2017 7,041 families with young children participated across all 21 NJ counties . Developmental screening is a required benchmark performance measure and improving developmental screening practices and policies is a current focus on HV evaluation and continuous quality improvement. NJ has completed a significant amount of work to creat e an aligned system of early education data through the NJ -EASEL ( NJ Enterprise Analysis System for Early Learning) . The NJ -EASEL project will link DOE's Statewide Longitudinal Data System (NJ SMART), DCF's Licensing System, DHS's Workforce Registry ( NJ Registry for Childhood Professionals, a component of the Grow NJ Kids data system), DHS's child care system (CASS), DCF's foster care system (NJ SPIRIT), DOH's Early Intervention System (NJEIS), DCF's Home Visiting system, Head Start/Early Head Start program data systems, and other state early learning and development data collections within the parameters of state and federal privacy laws . NJ-EASEL project is designed to be able to measure outcome objectives of the RTTT -ELC including being able to show that early developmental screening has a direct impact on identifying children and referring them to needed services resulting in positive outcomes for children . The NJ -EASEL data warehouse will serve as the repository through which collected data informs the q uality improvement and outreach activities \"managed\" by GNJK. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 58 The selected ESM 6.1 will monitor progress on increasing the use of parent -completed early childhood developmental screening using an online ASQ screening tool and how well early childhood deve lopmental screening is promoted across the Departments of Health, Children and Families, Human Services, and Education which will drive improvement in NPM #6 (Developmental Screening). NJ DCF implements the ECCS Impact grant in 5 communities to promote par ent-completed early childhood developmental screenings in children less than 3 years old. ASQ Enterprise software (Brookes Publishing) is being utilized to add a parent/family portal for easy access to developmental screening and links screening to Central Intake hubs. NJ's expanded data system will link developmental screenings with current Central Intake assessments to support pediatric primary care and/or other systems partners that include at a minimum Home Visiting; and may extend to quality Child Care, Early Head Start/Head Start, and Preschool programs.

FHS has been collaborating on and developing partnerships to address this NPM thru ShapingNJ and the CDC 1305 Cooperative Agreement in Community Health and Wellness and the CDC WS CC School Health NJ Project in MCHS . Regular physical activity can improve the health and quality of life of Americans of all ages. Physical activity in children and adolescents reduces the risk of early life risk factors for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Type II diabetes, and os teoporosis. In addition to aerobic and muscle -strengthening activities, bone -strengthening activities are especially important for children and young adolescents because the majority of peak bone mass is obtained by the end of adolescence. FHS recognizes that positive physical activity and healthy nutrition behaviors start at a young age and should be addressed as early as possible . Children at greatest risk for overweight and obesity as well as physical inactivity are concentrated in disadvantaged communi ties. With dedicated supports including training and technical assistance, as well as strengthened child care regulations, the prevalence of obesity among two to four year old children from low income families participating in NJ WIC decreased from 18.9% i n 2010 to 15.3% in 2014. ShapingNJ, the state public -private partnership for nutrition, physical activity and obesity prevention consists of some 230 organizations working to red uce and prevent obesity in NJ. The work is focused in 6 settings, including e arly care and education, schools, communities, work sites , health care and faith - based. In the communities, the NJDOH is part of a funding collaborative that together supports 66 NJ at - risk communities charged with implementing one healthy food access stra tegy and one physical activity strategy through policy and environmental change. The NJDOH also funds Faith in Prevention, an initiative charged with engaging faith -based organizations in the battle against chronic disease in Trenton, Camden and Newark.

NJ Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (NJAHPERD), with CDC funding, conducts professional development sessions at state wide and regional meetings on: Physical Education/P hysical Activity for K -12 teachers; School Food Service guidelines and nutrition standards for K-12 teachers; Preparing fresh fruits and vegetables for School Food Service staff. The NJ State Alliance of the YMCA, with CDC funding, continues to provide intensive training and technical assistance in five low -income school districts (including five - K-8 schools per district for a total of 25 schools; 1 high school per district in three districts = 3 high schools) to implement Comprehensive School Physical Activity and improve school nutrition environments. Health Corps, with State funding, supports efforts targeting three high schools. This funding supports three, full time, school -based youth coordinators to serve as peer mentors at the three high sch ool sites to implement nutrition, physical activity and healthy lifestyles activities with students, teachers and the greater surrounding community. Other nutrition, physical fitness and obesity prevention initiatives within the Office of Tobacco Control, Nutrition and Fitness (OTCNF) that are funded by the CDC - \"State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors and Promote School Health\" (CDC funding ends 6/30/18) support breastfeeding initiat ion, duration and exclusivity for the first six months of lif e and healthy communities. NJ Hospital Association (NJHA) - The OTCNF provides funding to the NJHA to continue training and technical assistance to eighteen of the 52 NJ maternity hospitals to h elp move them towards implementation of the WHO/UNICEF's \"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\", a program designed to promote exclusive and sustained breastfeeding . In September 2016, NJHA convene d a statewide training summit for all NJ maternity hospita ls. Birthing facilities utilize the 2015 document published by NJHA titled: Healthy Beginnings NJ : Supporting Breastfeeding Moms and Babies Technical Assistance Guide for Hospital Providers . Periodic webinars are provided to interested hospitals . All efforts are overseen by an Advisory Group that convenes quarterly. NJ Prevention Network (NJPN) - The OTCNF provides funding to NJPN's Get Active NJ program which provides technical assistance, training and incentives to assist municipalities to find way s to educate stakeholders on different policies that can promote walking and the many benefits that walking may have on their communities . The Get Active NJ - Walkability Toolkit created by NJPN, is intended to provide information and examples on how local policies are created at the municipal level to support walkability. The Food Trust - The OTCNF contracts with The Food Trust to implement activities and projects to promote policy and environmental change for obesity prevention in local communities . Trainings and technical assistance are provided to corner store owners in order to increase community residents access to healthy foods and beverages, particularly those at high -risk for obesity and other chronic disease . The Food Trust provides on -site te chnical assistance to a minimum of 14 small retailers to promote healthy retail sales in their stores . Corner stores are targeted through a collaboration with the NJ Departm ent of Health WIC Program, the Office of Community Health and Wellness - OTCNF and The Food Trust. Beyond requiring WIC authorization, participating stores must meet either of two definitions including 1) 'underserved areas' - defined by CDC as 'no healthier food retailers or 2) USDA criteria - defined as 'low income - low access at half mile urban and 10 miles rural'.

CDC recently released FOA DP18 -1801 \"School Health Actions.\" Eligible agencies included State Departments of Education, not State Departments of Health . Unfortunately, with a new Governor in office, effective January 2018, and new senior staff appointments, a decision was made by the NJ Department of Education not to apply for this funding opportunity . The release of a second FOA, CDC RFA DP18 - 1807 \"State Physical Activity and Nutrition Actions\", is pending . For three years beginning Fall 2015, DOH regional school health grantees annually renewed a MOA with Sustainable Jersey for Schools, to continue their work on increasing physical activity and/or improvi ng the built environment. In Fall 2018, 21 schools will focus their work on sustainability of school health within their educational system . An evaluator will be contracted to quantify and qualify sustainability issues and the impact of implemented changes . The selected ESM 8.1 (Number of schools participating in an activity (training, professional development, policy development, technical assistance) to improve physical activity among children (6 -17)) will be monitored to assess progress on promoting phy sical activity of children 6 through 17 by improving policies and practices in schools regarding physical activity. Plan for the Application Year - SPM # 2: The percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels ( 5 ug/dL). SPM #2 was selected to address the issue of elevated blood lead levels in children which is not specifically addressed by the NPMs or NOMs . Long -term exposure to lead can cause serious health problems, particularly in young children. Lead is toxic to everyone, but unborn babies and young children are at greatest risk for health problems from elevated blood lead levels \u2014 their smaller, growing bodies make them more susceptible to absorbing and retaining lead . Lead exposure can cause permanent damage to the brain and nervous system, resulting in hearing problems, slowed growth and anemia . Children with elevated blood lead levels are at increased risk for behavioral problems, developmental delays, and learning disorders . Increased childhood morbidity will result from undetected and un treated elevated blood lead levels . The CDC Cooperative Agreement will continue to support data -driven primary prevention interventions that are implemented by not only the NJDOH, but its strategic partners and childhood lead exposure prevention and heal thy homes grantees . Performance management strategies incorporated at the program level monitor progress towards the elimination of elevated blood lead levels and the timeliness and efficacy of public health responses for children with elevated blood lead levels . In October 2016, during national Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week, the NJDOH kicked -off the #kNOwLEAD awareness campaign which included a reformatted Child Health webpage, social media presence, and call center for consumers to get their questions answered and referrals to resources .

The Boggs Center on Developmental Disabilities, NJ's federally -designated University Center of Excellence on Developmental Disabilities, and the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN), the state's federally -designated Parent Training and Information Center (PTI) and Family to Family Health Information Center (F2F) collaborated on th e Act Early State Systems Grant with the shared goal of improving access to developmental screening and referral among underserved children in NJ. One of three overarching objectives of this project included strengthening the collaborative efforts bet ween The Boggs Center and SPAN within the scope of promoting developmental screening using validated instruments at appropriate intervals as well as referral for diagnosis, Early Intervention, and community services and supports at NJ's network of FQHCs an d community clinics. Over the project period, SPAN and The Boggs Center partnered to provide 15 parent -led trainings about developmental screenings to healthcare providers at FQHCs throughout the state, attended by a total of 195 participants . Overall, 7 trained SPAN Family Resource Specialists, each with a child on the autism spectrum, participated in the project and a total of 27 SPAN parents were represented at the 15 trainings . Early Intervention representatives presented at 9 of the 15 trainings; all but one were parents and one was a sibling . NJ is part of a national Project LAUNCH initiative designed to promote the wellness of young children ages birth to 8, and reduce racial and ethnic disparities including an emphasis on routine developmental screening. NJ Project LAUNCH is targeting urban Essex County and is using a Help Me Grow systems approach to strengthen the connections between physicians, parents/families, and c ommunity providers to addresses the physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of child development. Project LAUNCH ensures that parents/families have access to a continuum of community -based evidence -based programs (EBP) that support p arent -child interaction and young child development across a range of settings \u2014health care, home visiting, child care, Early Head Start/Head Start, preschool/school to promote early identification of health and developmental issues that impact child wellne ss.

Child care partners continue to offer training and technical assistance at county and statewide trainings to increase center staff capacity for best practices that will prevent obesity in our most vulnerable population . Beginning in April 2013, NJ received funding fr om Nemours Foundation as part of a six -state early care and education learning collaborative to ensure that licensed child care providers offer children healthy food, breastfeeding support and opportunities for active play . One hundred licensed centers ser ving 100 or more children were enrolled . Participation in this project will assist centers meet and exceed new licensing requirements . New licensing requirements were adopted by the Office of Licensing (Department of Children and Families) and became effec tive September 30, 2013 (http://www.state.nj.us/dcf/providers/licensing/laws/CCCmanual.pdf) . Sustainability efforts can be achieved through participation in a six -state early care and education learning collaborative coordinated by the Nemours Foundation a nd funded by CDC . A state coordinator was hired to work within the NJDOH and five regional learning collaboratives were established in NJ in year one of a five -year funding that focused on improving skills of child care center staff.

NJDOH continue d to assist the remaining laboratories to transition from reporting on hard copies to electronic reporting . NJ has legislation that requires children to be screened for elevated blood lead levels . Every primary ca re provider and health care facility that provides care to children less than six years of age is required to comply with the law. Collaborative efforts with Medicaid and its contracted managed care providers continued in order to monitor and increase the number of Medicaid -enrolled children screened for elevated bloo d lead levels. LeadTrax records are matched biannually to the Medicaid Eligibility file to identify blood lead screening rates and unscreened Me dicaid participating children. LeadTrax testing results are included in the NJ Immunization Information System (NJIIS) to provide healthcare providers with screening results and histories. Monitoring of a Lead Elimination Plan and a Healthy Homes Strategic Plan continued to be coordinated by NJ DOH to assure that the state is collectively making progress to eliminate elevated blood lead levels and other housing hazards that may affect the health of residents. Training opportunities for professionals were made available through the NJ Healthy Home s Training Center, a public -private partnership between NJDOH and Isles, Inc, a Trenton -based, non -profit, community development agency.

Adolescent / Young Adult Health The domain of Adolescent/Young Adult Health includes focuses on NPM #10 ( Percent of adolescents, ages 12 through 17, with a preventive medical visit in the past year ), NPM # 11 (Percent of children with and without special health care needs having a m edical home) and NPM #12 ( Percent of children with and without special health care needs who received services necessary to make transitions to adult health care ). Because reporting on NPM #11 and #12 overlap the two domains of Adolescent/Young Adult Health and SCHCN , the narrative for NPM #11 and #12 will be presented in this Adolescent/Young Adult Health section and not repeated in the CYSHCN Section . This section serves as the state's narrative plan for the Application year and as the Annual Report for the reporting year . Planned activities for the Application year are described and programmatic efforts summarize d that have been undertaken for the An nual Report year, with primary emphasis placed on the performance impacts that have been achieved . The strategies and activities to address the identified priorities from the Needs Assessment Summary are further described. Plan for the Application Year - NPM #1 0: Improving NPM #10 ( Percent of adolescents, ages 12 through 17, with a preventive medical visit in the past year ) is an important performance measure in the domain of Adolescent/Young Adult Health and is related to SPN #4 Promoting Youth Development . Receiving health care services, including annual adolescent preventive well visits, helps adolescents adopt or maintain healthy habits and behaviors, avoid healthdamaging behaviors, manage chronic conditions, and prevent disease . The patien t-centered medical home is a way of organizing primary care that emphasizes care coordination and communication to improve patients' and providers' experience of care and the quality of care for all children . Promotion of the medical home is a strategy t o improve NPM # 10 (Percent of adolescents, ages 12 through 17, with a preventive medical visit in the past year ). Providing a medical home means offering care that is accessible, family -centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and cu lturally effective (AAP, Policy Statement, July 2002). A medical home is a place where care for the child and adolescent is centralized, coordinated and monitored. A team approach to medical home improvement includes engaged staff members and parents as ke y improvement partners. NJAAP has identified the medical home as one of 8 key issues to address to improve pediatric care in NJ. Since 2009, NJAAP, NJDOH and other partners have been working to increase primary care team education and awareness about the medical home to promote prevention, wellness and chronic care management . With the opportunity for NCQA Recognition as a patient centered medical home, NJAAP's support has enabled participating practices to assess their current level of \"medical homeness\" using the Medical Home Index, and additionally has engaged their participation in various QI activities. The plan for the applicant year for NPM #10 is to continue the Medical Home Technical Assistance Program for 201 7-2018 \"Improving Population -Based Health Management\" which proposes that the NJAAP, in partnership with the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network (SPAN) , now called SPAN Parent Advocacy Network, and the NJDOH , implemented HRSA's Integrated Systems Grant (ISG) to improve access to quality, culturally competent, family centered systems of service for children, especially children with special health care needs . This support for the Medical Home Initiative enabled NJAAP to work with over 30 practices in 13 counties across NJ in the development of practice teams and utilization of the model for improvement to strengthen patient centered medical homes . NJ's competitive application, to the National Resource Center (NRC) and AMCHP for the 2nd cohort of the Adolescent and Young Adult Health (AYAH) Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) , was approved . Data from a NJ FQHC report identified a greater than 50% disparity for adolescent preventive medical visits at FQHCs (averaging about 45% during the years of 2013 -2015) as compared to private physician offices (averaging about 97%) . The goal of the NJ AYAH CoIIN is to increase the FQHC adolescent visit rate to achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of 75.6%. The State Team attend ed a two -day Summit on May 9 -10, 2017 . Assistance will be p rovided for the Team to develop an 18 month collaborative workplan for implementing evidence -based strategies . On April 11, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 65 2017, the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative convene d a youth panel to present their ideas on adolescent -friendly services.

As adolescents move from childhood to adulthood, they assume individual responsibility for health habits, and those who have chronic health problems take on a greater role in managing those conditions . Receiving health care services, including annual adolescent preventive well visits, helps adolescents adopt or maintain healthy habits and behaviors, avoid health damaging behaviors, manage chronic conditions, and prevent disease . Providing comprehensive care to children in a medical home is the standard of pediatric practice that should be delivered within the context of a trusting and collaborative relationship between the child's family and a competent health professional familiar with the child and family and the child's health history . Resear ch indicates that children with a stable and continuous source of health care are more likely to receive appropriate preventive care and immunizations, are less likely to be hospitalized for preventable conditions, and are more likely to be diagnosed early for chronic or disabling conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) specifies seven qualities essential to medical home care: accessible, family -centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate and culturally effective. Ideally, medical home care is delivered within the context of a trusting and collaborative relationship between the child's family and a competent health professional familiar with the child and family and the child's health history. Providing comprehensive care t o children in a medical home is the standard of pediatric practice. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau uses the AAP definition of medical home. State staff continues to develop refined techniques within the electronic reporting system (i.e., CMRS) that w ill include all seven qualities essential to medical home care. CYSHCN with a medical home has been a priority for the SCHEIS program and has been supported by several partnerships and collaboratives . Having a primary care physician service identified in a child's Individual Service Plan (ISP) developed with an SCHS CM served as a medical home proxy beginning with 2014 reporting. As part of the Medical Home grant, FCCS and its partners developed a Shared Plan of Care (SPoC), a document meant to increase ca re coordination for CYSHCN . This additional component was added to the medical home proxy with 2017 reporting for ESM 11.1 . It is acknowledged that a medical home is more comprehensive than just having a primary care physician. In part, it is also imperati ve for a child to have consistent health insurance to increase access to said provider. Of the 21,354 children age 0 to 18 years served in FFY 2017, 7,653 (approximately 35.8%) had a primary care physician and/or SPoC documented, and of those children appr oximately 57.1% had insurance identified NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 66 in their ISP. The percent of CYSHCN ages 0 -18 years served by SCHS CMUs with a pr imary care physician and/or SPoC has been selected as ESM 11.1, which should increase NPM #11 (Children with and without special healt h care needs having a medical home). 2014 SCHS CM data obtained through CMRS informed a quality improvement initiative targeting medical home charting within CYSCHN's ISP's . FCCS staffs identified baseline SFY 14 data on key proxies used to note documenta tion of those outcomes in CMRS by the SCH CMUs and compared those findings to NJ State and national findings reported in the 2009/2010 National Survey of CSHCN (NS -CSHCN). Baseline 2014 and follow -up annual findings are shared with the SCHS CMUs at quarter ly SCHS CM meetings. These presentations are part of FCCS staff's ongoing quality improvement project, for further discussion about ensuring access to a medical home for CYSCHN and CMRS documentation of this work. During SFY17, all Programmatic, Narrative and Chart Review Site Visit Forms for Child Evaluation Centers (CECs), Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Centers (CLCP) and Pediatric Tertiary Centers (PTCs) were revised to include questions regarding the presence and/or establishment of a Medical Home. Ques tions include: \"1) Does the team provide each family with education regarding the concept of a Medical Home and its role in coordination of care for CYSHCN? 2) Does the team assist/facilitate the establishment of a Medical Home for the patient and patient family if no Medical Home is Present? 3) How are patients assessed for the Presence of a Medical Home? 4) Do Multidisciplinary Evaluation Reports and ISPs include doc ument regarding Medical Home\"? During SFY18, the revised Programmatic and Narrative Site Visit Forms for CECs, CLCPs and PTCs were used for annual Site Visits. 100% of all CECs, CLCPs and PTCs answered \"yes\" to questions regarding the presence and/or establishment of a Medical Home. Each CEC, CLCP and PTC stated that they provide each family w ith education regarding the concept of a Medical Home and its role in coordination of care of CYSHCN and assist/facilitate the establishment of a Medical Home for the patient and patient's family if no Medical Home is Present. Additionally, each CEC, CLCP and PTC provided a policy regarding the assessment for the Presence of a Medical Home and identified areas for documentation on the Multidisciplinary Evaluation Reports and ISPs regarding Medical Home. Table NPM 11 - Percent of children with and without sp ecial health care needs having a medical home 2007 2011_2012 2016 Percent of children with special health care needs having a medical home 51.8 42.2 42.0 Percent of children without special health care needs having a medical home 57.8 55.4 51.3 Data Source: National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) A total of 10 pediatric/family medicine practices across NJ, representing 126,500 children were recruited to participate in the AAP's Patient Centered Medical Home Technical Assistance program. The goal of the project was to expand and build NJ's capacity by having the NJAAP/Medical Home Quality Improvement Team become NCQA Recognized Experts and by staffing an \"NCQA Recognition Warm Line\" available to Pediatricians across the State. In September 2015, FC CS was awarded a 2 --year ISG to increase the percentage of CYSHCN with a medical home by 20% . FCCS partnered with NJAAP, SPAN, and three SCHS for this project. As part of the ISG, FCCS and its partners: developed a Shared Plan of Care tool that was pi loted beginning May 1, 2017 by three SCHS CMUs to increase cross - system care coordination; developed five (5) presentations that were delivered to seven partnering primary care practices in 25 locations to increase knowledge, partnerships, and integration; developed linkage agreements between partnering practices and both SPAN and SCHS CMUs to increase integration across partners; and connected partnering practices with SCHS CM to increase awareness of SCHS CMUs as a shared resource for CYSHCN, including th ose who are within the tran sition to adulthood age range. The three SCHS CMUs distributed approximately 103 SPoCs between May 1, 2017 NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 67 and September 30, 2017 . SPoC distribution is ongoing with future plans for spread and sustainability of this tool across a ll counties. Health Service grants funded by RPHS will continue to require agencies to outreach and facilitate enrollment of potentially eligible children into health insurance . The Improving Pregnancy Outcomes Initiative will increase health insurance en rollment by assessing health insurance status and referring uninsured families with adolescents . State SCHEIS staff will continue to refine tracking of Performance Measures in CMRS and provide documentation training to SCHS CMUs to ensure activities rela ted to these Measures are accurately counted . Changes to CMRS were made to accommodate reporting, data collection, and tracking of medical home components . FCCS distributed ISG funding of $15,0 00 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2017 to implement these changes to CM RS. State staffs will continue to share resources and training updates with SPSPs on the reorganization of State programs and services that can influence access to primary and specialty care, including the Comprehensive Waiver, Managed Long -Term Services and Supports, and changes in access to care through implementation of the Affordable Care Act . Likewise, continuing to promote linkages between the Medicaid managed care agencies will remain important in supporting families with CYSCHN seeking in - State spe cialty care. Title V will continue to support a safety net of specialty providers and case m anagement units . Trends in the use of specialty care across the provider network will continue to be monitored by State staffs via onsite monitoring and programmatic reports . Likewise, continued collaboration with network agencies, State agency and community -based partners through the COCC , and consumers, will continue to promote linkage for CYSHCN with a medical home. Plan for the Application Year - NPM #12 (transition to adulthood) The transition of youth to adulthood has become a priority issue nationwide as evidenced by the clinical report and algorithm developed jointly by the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Physicians to improve healthcare transitions for all youth and families. Over 90% of children with special health care needs now live to adulthood, but are less likely than their non -disabled peers to complete high school, attend college o r to be employed. Health and health care are cited as two of the major barriers to making successful transitions. Table NPM #12 : The percentage of adolescents (12 -17) with (and without) special health care needs who received the services necessary to make transitions to all aspects of adult life, including adult health care, work, and independence. 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016* 2017+ Annual Is the Data Provisional or Final? Final Final Final Final Final Final Final Final Final Provis ional Notes - Indicator data for 2005 -2012 comes from the National Survey of CYSHCN, a numerator and denominator are not available (N/A). Beginning 2014, the denominator represents all children age 12 -17 years served in FFY by Special Child Health Services Case Manageme nt Units (SCHS CMU). The numerator reflects the number of children who had at least one transition -type services identified in their Individual Service Plan ( ISP). For 2014 and 2015, four possible types of transition to adulthood services were identified as proxies: NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 68 1. identification of an adult -level primary care physician (i.e., pediatrician excluded in the current definition) , 2. transition -specific services including Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) , 3. employment , and 4. health insurance . *Beginning 2016, a fifth type of service was added following SCHS CMU feedback during a quality improvement presentation in September 2016: supplemental security income (SSI). +Beginning 2017, two additional types of services were added: Shared Plan of Car e (SPoC) and any service tied to 'transition to adulthood' documented as an Exceptional Event in the youth's record. SCHS CMUs serve children with special health care needs up to their 22nd birthday. When the age criterion is relaxed to include youth age 12 to 21 years, 6,156 youth were served in FFY 2017. Of those youth, 2,693 (approximately 43.7%) received at least one service to aid in transition to adulthood. Identification and monitoring of transition to adulthood needs for CYSHCN and their families served through the SCHS CMUs statewide is ongoing . Transition packets continue to be updated and shared with families and linkage with community -based supports is provided . State staffs monitor the SCHS CMUs efforts to in reach and outreach to CYSHCN regarding transition, and documentation of goals related to transition on adolescents' ISPs . Likewise, efforts to capture the discussion of transition to adulthood between families of CYSHCN and SPSP providers are in process. The SCHS CMUs continue to facilitate transition to adulthood with youth by ensuring a transition to adulthood goal on the ISP. Likewise, exploring youth and their parents' needs to facilitate transition with insurance, education, employment, and housing, and linking them to community -based partners will continue . The quality improvement project that started in 2014 includes transition to adulthood CMRS documentation and NPM #12 proxies described above. FCCS staff presented additional CMRS documentation tra ining on transition to adulthood in December 2016 as part of the ISG . The ongoing QI presentation s to the SCHS CMUs stimulated an active discussion about how SCHS CM documentation produces system wide data that is used for QI and MCHBG reporting . These presentations also inform FCCS and SCHS CMU staffs on areas for training to more effectively unlearn and relearn documentation methods, to move from a lengthy narrative charting style to the use of drop down menus supported by brief entries that use shorter more consistent terminology . The State Health Data Specialist staff collaborate with the Quality Assurance Specialist Nurse and Program Officers to review and analyze CMRS data, and to provide additional QI presentations highlighting progress and additiona l areas of improvement in documentation on the Core Outcomes at SCHS CMU quarterly meeting s. During SFY17, all Programmatic, Narrative and Chart Review Site Visit Forms for Child Evaluation Centers (CECs), Cleft Lip/Palate Craniofacial Centers (CLCP) and Pediatric Tertiary Centers (PTCs) were revised to include questions regarding Transition to Adulthood. Questions include: \"1) does the team provide each family with education regarding the concept of Transition of Care (from pediatric to adult care) and it s role in the coordination of care for CYSHCN? 2) Does the team assist/facilitate a Transition Plan of Care for the patient and patient family if no Transition Plan of Care is Present? 3) How is Transition to Adulthood addressed by this agency? 4) Do Multi disciplinary Evaluation Reports and ISP include documentation regarding Transition to Adulthood?\" During SFY18, the revised Programmatic and Narrative Site Visit Forms for CECs, CLCPs and PTCs were used for annual Site Visits. 100% of all CECs, CLCPs and PTCs answered \"yes\" to questions regarding Transition to Adulthood. Each CEC, CLCP and PTC stated that they provide each family with education regarding the concept of Transition of Care (from pediatric to adult care) and its role in coordination of care o f CYSHCN and assist/facilitate a Transition Plan of Care for the patient and patient's family if no Transition Plan of Care is Present. Additionally, each CEC, CLCP and PTC provided a policy regarding the establishment of a Transition Plan Care and identif ied areas for documentation on the Multidisciplinary Evaluation Reports and ISPs regarding Transition to Adulthood. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 69 SCHS CMUs and pediatric specialty providers will refer youth and/or their parents to NJ Council for Developmental Disabilities (NJ CDD) fo r participation in Partners in Policymaking (PIP) self -advocacy training as well as continue to assist youth and their families to advocate for transitional supports through their individualized education plans and community -based supports . Title V will co ntinue to participate in PIP mock trials to facilitate the development of clients' self -advocacy skills. Under health care reform, NJ Medicaid eligibility for single adults has expanded in 2014 to up to 133% FPL. As this population is intended to include a significant percentage of childless adults with incomes below 133 % of FPL, it is anticipated that CYSHCN transitioning to adulthood will have expanded opportunity to access health coverage through Medicaid, the insurance exchange, and coverage through their parents' insurance through age 26 (or in certain circumstance till age 31) . In addition, it is also possible that some youth/young adults with special needs on Medicaid may experience a shift in eligibility to an insurance exchange. 20.8% of the 12 -21 year old youth who were served by SCHS CMUs in FFY2017 had an insurance service documented. Of those with insurance documented, 52.4% had Medicaid/NJ Family Care specifically. The Arc of NJ's annual Mainstreaming Medical Care Conference has been planned for June 1, 201 8. Title V participates on its Advisory Board, and the overarching theme of the upcoming conference is medical care for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities and promoting quality healthcare . Key conference concepts cogent to NPM #11 and NPM #12 include elements of planning for the future, understanding Medicaid/Medicare dual eligibility and access to Division of Developmental Disabilities service s to support transition to adulthood, and culturally competent delivery of care for persons with developmental disabilities from diverse communities. The percent of CYSHCN ages 12 -17 years served by SCHS CMUs with at least one transition to adulthood serv ice has been selected as ESM 12.1, which should increase NPM #12 (Transition to Adulthood). Annual Report - NPM #10: Percent of adolescents, ages 12 through 17, with a preventive medical visit in the past year From July 2009 through August 2014, NJAAP, in partnership with the SPAN and the NJDOH , implemented HRSA's Integrated Systems Grant (ISG) to improve access to quality, culturally competent, family centered systems of service for children, especially childre n with special health care needs . This support for the Medical Home initiative enabled NJAAP to work with over 30 practices in 13 counties across NJ in the development of practice teams and utilization of the model for improvement to strengthen patient cen tered medical homes . The ISG program success was measured utilizing practice pre/post responses on the Medical Home Index (a nationally validated self -assessment tool for measuring \"Medical Homeness\") . Results for participating practices showed an overall increase from pre to post, representing an increase in their overall \"Medical Homeness\" . Receiving recognition for their degree or \"Level\" of Medical Homeness, was for many practices, the next step after participating in NJAAP's Medical Home Initiative . In 2015, NJAAP implemented the Patient Centered Medical Home Technical Assistance program to support practices taking the next step toward NCQA Recognition as a Patient Centered Medical Home . The National Center for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognition as a Patient Centered Medical Home involves a detailed and lengthy process with many standards and elements, including \"Must Pass\" elements, that busy Pediatric practices find difficult to navigate independently . Attainment of NCQA Recognition as a PCMH provi des practices with payment incentives that will support and sustain financing their Medical Homes . Research demonstrates that PCMHs achieve powerful results. The Patient -Centered Primary Care Collaborative recently summarized PCMH demonstration findings th at show success in increasing quality while reducing costs (http://www.pcpcc.net/content/pcmh -outcome - evidence -quality) . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 70 To build NJ in -house capacity to best support pediatric practices in the NCQA -PCMH process, the NJAAP/Medical Home Quality Improvemen t Team members attended the 3 -day NCQA Content Expert training sessions (1 attended in 2014; 2 attended in 2015) with a goal of becoming NCQA Recognized Content Experts (currently 2 team member s are at Certified status) . Knowledge gained from attending these classes has allowed team members to better support the NJAAP NCQA Recognition Warm Line\" - available (Fall 2014) at (609) 842 -0014 for technical assistance with PCMH Recognition . In addition to expanding in house capacity, through the Patient Centered Medical Home Technical Assistance Program, NJAAP worked with 7 practices across NJ, (representing 126,500 children) utilizing the knowledge gained through the Model for Quality Improvement and by overseeing the policies, processes and procedural changes t hat many of the practices implemented throughout their participation in the Medical Home Initiative . NJAAP provided technical assistance as several of the participating practices moved toward applying for formal National (NCQA) recognition as a Patient -Centered Medical Home . Given the time commitment required by practices to successfully document and submit their application to NCQA, 4 of the 10 participating practices engaged the use of a PCMH Recognition Consultant, to aid in the process of NCQA applicati on submission, while also engaging our Medical Home team as a resource regarding suggestions for QI projects, review of tools they were using to aid in NCQA submission, selection of Chronic Diseases for population management, MOC credit information, and as an overall medical home information source. In an effort to assess level of interest and need as to how best our team could support practices along the PCMH continuum, the NJAAP Medical Home team created and distributed a Medical Home Program Survey to t he participating practices. Responses point to the need for Care Planning and Care Management within practices that have or will undergo NCQA Recognition. Follow ing attendance at the AYAH CoIIN Summit held on May 9 -10, 2017, the State Team will convene t o develop a feasible 18 month workplan with measurable objectives, evidence -based strategies and collaborative activities to improve the rate of the adolescent well visit at FQHCs . Annual Report - NPM #11: Percent of children with and without special health care needs having a medical home All (100%) of CYSHCN referred into NJ Title V's SPSP providers and SCHS CMUs are screened for status of primary care provider and their families are provided with inform ation on how to link with a primary care provider/medical home . The Title V SCHS CMUs and pediatric specialty providers will continue to provide a safety net for families of CYSHCN . The number of CYSHCN served 61,894 (SFY16) vs. 70,4 14 (SFY17). Demand remains particularly high for comprehensive team evaluation , and some agencies report a 3 - to 6-month wait to schedule new clients . To reverse the wait time to schedule a new comprehensive team evaluation, State staffs provide consultat ion to SPSP agencies . In an attempt to reduce wait time, multiple CEC s recently implemented a pre -appointment call to families of CYSHCN that screened for presenting needs . In some instances, this technique allowed for targeted appointments with specialist s rather than a full evaluation, streamlined scheduling, reduced appointment wait time to less than 6 weeks, and opened up appointments that necessitated full team evaluations in a more timely manner . Anecdotally, the agency reported that although their ef forts required a slight increase in staffing time it yielded a reduced wait time, and all CYSHCN as well as their referring physicians were provided with service plans . The results of this effort were shared with other CECs, and they are exploring the poss ibility of replicating it . State programmatic monitoring to ensure that clients have and/or are referred to community -based providers will remain ongoing; chart audits and visits to assess clinic days and provide consultation as well as follow -up telephone support will continue . Title V is committed to collaboration with the DHS Office of Medicaid Managed Care, the COCC, SPAN, and the NJAAP, and other community -based partners to engage in medical home initiative s to reinforce linkage of CYSHCN with compre hensive community providers. ISG projects are ongoing and have built NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 71 upon one another. In July 2009 Title V , in partnership with the NJAAP and SPAN, implemented HRSA's Integrated Systems Grant (ISG) to improve access to quality, culturally competent, family -centered systems of service for children, especially children with special health care needs. This project enabled NJAAP to work with over 30 practices in 13 counties across the State in the development of practice teams and use of the model for improvement to strengthen patient -centered medical homes . The ISG program success was measured using evaluation of t he Medical Home Index (a nationally validated self - assessment tool for measuring \"Medical Homeness\" that each practice must complete pre - and post - program participation). Results for participating practices showed an overall increase from pre - to post, representing an increase in their overall \"Medical Homeness .\" Receiving recognition for their degree or \"Level\" of Medical Homeness, is for many practices, the next step after participating in NJ AAP's Medical Home Initiative . With knowledge gained through the Model for Quality Improvement and with the policies, processes and procedural changes that many of the practices implemented throughout their participation in the Initiative, many of the practices were ready to apply for formal recognition, with a goal of payment incentives that will support and sustain financing their Medical Homes . National Center for Quality Assurance (NCQA) recognition as a Patient Centered Medical Home involves a detailed and time -consuming process with many standards and elements, including \"Must Pass\" elements . Focus for Fiscal Year 2014 was to provide guidance and technical assistance to the practices that were ready to begin this recognition process. SPAN, the NJAAP, and COCC members in 2012 targeted improvement in access to me dical homes for immigrant CYSCHN and their families in three high need/limited English proficiency communities in northern NJ : Passaic, Hudson and Union counties . This project engaged Federally Qualified Health Centers, parents of CYSHCN, and family resour ce specialists linked with the SCHS CMUs in the above - mentioned counti es to promote \"medical homeness \". Likewise, it promoted navigation skill development for immigrant underserved parents of CYSHCN , and leadership training . Referral to and coordination wi th in-State specialty care providers was also a component of technical assistance provided to private community -based pediatricians and family practitioners, hospital -based practices, and FQHCs through the ISG medical home project . In 2014, Title V in collaboration with SPAN, the COCC, the NJAAP, and other community -based partners , responded to a HRSA request for applications for a State Implementation Grant for Enhancing the System of Services for CYSHCN through System Integration . Although that opport unity was approved but not funded in the first year, funding was granted in the second year . The project was completed in 2017 and work focused on aims set forth by HRSA in three domains: cross - system care coordination, integration, and shared resource . FCCS collaborated with SPAN, NJAAP, and three SCHS CMUs. Program implementation and project evaluation aligned with and expanded NPM #11 and NPM #12 reporting. Ongoing improvements to the Case Management Referral System (CMRS) allowed new and different opportunities to track NPM 11 and 12 . Rather than definitive identifiers for these Performance Measures, \"proxies\" were identified and used for this year's reporting . SCHS CMUs served 22,012 CYSHCN in - NPM #12 Efforts to improv e documentation of transition to adulthood activities performed by SCHS CM Us and documented in the electronic Case Management Referral System (CMRS) were implemented . State staffs provide ongoing technical assistance and guidance via site visits, desktop audits, and conference calls to improve the data collected and reported on transition to adulthood activities and client outcomes. As part of an ongoing QI initiative, State staff have presented Q I findings and additional guidance on an approximately quarterly basis to SCHS CMUs . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 72 The adolescent subset of CYSHCN served through Title V is observed to be significant. In SFY 2017, approximately 15% of CYSHCN served across the SCHS CMUs were aged 14 -19 years of age. The percentage of youth age 14 -19 years served by the SPSP agencies was greater, comprising nearly 24% of those served by the Tertiary Centers, and 15% by the CEC/FAS Centers . reported 9% CYSHCN se rved among that same age group. Transition planning and implementation will remain a priority for these youth, their families, NJ Title V, and providers. Documentation of transition planning was largely noted by SCHS CMUs to occur on or about age 14 . A discussion with parents/youth about transition planning, and the distribution of transition packets were noted . An anecdotal observation by the SCHS CMs noted that families reported that they preferred to receive materials incrementally rather than one very large packet filled with resources . That incremental method provided them with the opportunity to focus on one or a few transition needs at a time, such as primary care provider; access to Supplemental Security Income and/or health insurance including Medi caid, Medicaid expansion and/or private insurance or the Marketplace; education/job training supports; statewide systems of care including the Department of Human Services' Division of Developmental Disabilities and/or the Department of Children and Family 's Children's System of Care Initiative, and others. Furthermore, the Fee for Service program is creating a brochure aimed at increasing programmatic knowledge and access for those who may have been terminated from the Supplemental Security Income program or have aged out of the covered benefits portion of their insurance program in efforts to support transition to adulthood. Follow -up monitoring and discussion supported family's ability to digest the material, and critically think about their needs over ti me. The Specialized Pediatric Services Program (SPS P) providers conducted evaluations and developed service plans with adolescent CYSHCN and their families . In addition, SPS P providers reported providing youth with transition to adulthood resources regard ing genetics, family medicine, adult providers, support groups and other medical and social related needs. The linkage of CYSHCN to multidisciplinary team members including social work and other community -based systems such as SCHS CM, SPAN, and disability -specific organizations including the Arc, Tourette's Association, and Parents' Caucus was also a strategy implemented by the SPSP agencies. Through an agreement with SPAN, the Family WRAP (Wisdom, Resources and Parent to Parent) project provides informat ion, resources and one -to-one family support that are directly helpful to clients . Likewise, the close working relationship with the SCHS CMUs and the SPAN Resource Parents and Parent to Parent family support offers some opportunities for cross -training on community -based resources for transition . Linkages developed through previous ISG grants have facilitated the distribution of materials developed by SPAN, NJ AAP, NJDOH, and other community partners engaged in the COCC to medical practices . Community -based partners continued to identify resources and linkages to support transition to adulthood for CYSHCN . Likewise, training was provided to Title V providers on work incentives for persons who receive SSI or SSDI benefits, and NJ DHS' Managed Long Term Ser vices and Supports program. A major systems change in the redistribution of services for children and adolescents under age 16 with developmental disabilities was implemented . Access to care for those children and adolescents has been reassigned to the DC F, and they are also charged with collaboration with the Department of Education (DOE) and DHS's Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) to facilitate transition to adulthood services . At age 18 or high school graduation, youth/young adults' services are the responsibility of the DHS's DDD. Training on this systems change, as well as continued training on DHS' DDD and DCF's Children's System of Care Initiative affecting adolescents with developmental disabilities, is occurring with regularity among the SCHS CMUs . Collaboration with intergovernmental and community partners including DDD, DCF, NJ Council on Developmental Disabilities, Boggs Center, SPAN, the Arc, Traumatic Brain Injury Association and families is critical to appropriate access to services and supports. Identification and monitoring of transition to adulthood needs for CYSHCN and their families served through SCHS CMUs statewide is in process as well. County -specific transition packets including resources related to education, post -secondar y education, vocational rehabilitation, housing, guardianship, SSI, insurance, and Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare are shared with families and linkage with NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 73 community -based supports is provided. State staffs monitor the SCHS CMU's efforts to inreach and outreach to CYSHCN regarding transition, and documentation of goals related to transition on adolescents' individual service plans. Aligned with the Title V CYSHCN programs and funded by Part D of the Ryan White Care Act, the NJ Statewide Family Centered HIV Care Ne twork remains a leading force in providing care to women, infants, children, youth (WICY) and families infected and affected by HIV disease in the State . Consequently, there is ongoing collaboration across systems within the Division of Family Health Servi ces' Maternal Child Health and CYSHCN's programs, and the Ryan White Part D program to support WICY needs in the community . NJ ranks third in the nation for pediatric cases . Of youth 13 -24 years, 912 were living with HIV/AIDS in 201 6. Through diligent effo rts to treat and educate HIV -infected pregnant women, the perinatal transmission rate in NJ remains very low . Intensive case management, coupled with appropriate antiretroviral therapy, enables children with HIV to survive into and successfully transition into adulthood . However, transition to an adult program for CYSCHN is a critical decision and one that must be planned appropriately to ensure the youth remains in care . Although Title V will continue to assess youth's progress toward transition and linkage with community -based supports, the SCHS CM and SPSP programs are exploring the development of standardized needs assessment and quality indicators to better measure NJ CYSHCN's experiences. NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 74 E.2.c.v Children with Special Health Care Needs The population domain of CSHCN includes NPM #11 and #12 which were covered in the previous Adolescent / Young Adult Health domain and SPMs 3, 4 and 5 which impact NOMs 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22. Plan for the Application Year State Pe rformance Measure 3 : Percentage of newborns who are discharged from NJ hospitals, reside in NJ, did not pass their newborn hearing screening and who have outpatient audiological follow -up documented. An important SPM in the domain of CSHCN is SPM #3 (Perc entage of newborns who are discharged from NJ hospitals, reside in NJ, did not pass their newborn hearing screening and who have outpatient audiological follow -up documented) which was selected during the last Five -Year Needs Assessment . The NJ EHDI Time ly Follow -up and Early Intervention/Audiology Learning Communities (LC) met five times in 2017 and continues to meet in 2018 to identify tests of change for improvement of screening, diagnostic testing and early intervention enrollment . A third LC, the Fam ily Engagement LC has been established and held its first meeting in December 2017. It is made up of family members of children who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Family Engagement LC members participated in a day long 'serving on groups' program to assist t hem with becoming family leaders. The establishment of the Family Engagement LC assists the EHDI program in understanding the needs of Deaf and hard of hearing children and their families. The LCs are a cohort -based multidisciplinary approach to improve EI access to services, timely hearing screening, language acquisition, enlist family engagement, and focus on literacy and social and emotional growth for the infants and children of NJ. LC's include at least one primary care provider, one care coordinator a nd one family member of a Deaf or hard of hearing child in addition to health care professionals and community members . The EHDI program will continue to send hospital -level surveillance data to each hospital with maternity services . A report with their overall statistics is sent annually. Monthly hospital contacts received a reconciliation list of children who were still in need of follow -up after missed or referred inpatient hearing screening . During 2016 the program used a Plan/Do/Study/Act (PDSA) qual ity improvement process to determine if a monthly notification to hospitals of children in need of a follow -up improves outcomes . Following the success of this PDSA QI process, the monthly reconciliation process was adopted. The program will continue annu al distribution of audiology facility reports to highlight timeliness of follow - up and identify children with incomplete follow -up testing. The EHDI program plans to continue efforts to work with medical homes to ensure that children are receiving timely and appropriate follow -up after a referred hearing screening or inconclusive follow -up testing . An extract available in the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NIIIS) allows the EHDI program to identify the name, address and fax number of the medic al home provider that has most recently provided immunization data for a child and will use this information to send fax -back forms to provider offices to remind them to refer children for additional follow -up as needed. The program will continue the gran t-supported activities including case management outreach to families in need of hearing follow -up and support by the EI Hearing Consultants. In addition, two new grant - supported activities, a Deaf and Hard of Hearing Mentoring and Role Model program and t he development of learning communities for parents of children identified with hearing loss are planned . These activities will continue pending continued availability of grant funds. EHDI staff will continue educational presentations to hospital staff, p ediatricians, audiologists, Special Child Health Service Case Managers, Early Intervention Service Coordinators, and other health care NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 75 professionals, focusing on the need to decrease rates of children who are lost to follow -up. The EHDI program frequently uses webinars to make educational outreach efforts more accessible to the target audiences, decrease staff travel time, and improve efficiency while decreasing costs. NJ EHDI staff will begin collaboration with the EI Hearing Consultants to coordinate outreach meetings with pediatric audiologists regarding timely referral of children with hearing loss to Early Intervention. As per the suggestion of the NJ EHDI advisory board, The Hearing Evaluation Council, regarding CMV/pediatric hearing loss awarenes s/prevention, NJ EHDI has updated their website with public service information in multiple languages geared toward women of childbearing age and have begun the process of partnering with the Maternal and Child Health Consortia to provide information to ho spital based OB/GYN waiting rooms. Plan for the Application Year State Performance Measure 4: Percent of live children registered with the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS) who have been referred to NJ's Special Child Health Services Ca se Management Unit who are receiving services . SPM #4 was chosen to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of using the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS), which has been an invaluable tool for surveillance, needs assessment, service pla nning, research, and to link families to services. NJ has the oldest requirement in the nation for the reporting of birth defects, starting in 1928, and since then, linking registered children to health services. Since 1985, NJ has maintained a population -based registry of children with all defects. Starting in 2003, the Early Identification and Monitoring (EIM) Program received a CDC cooperative agreement for the implementation of a web -based data reporting and tracking system. In 2007, NJ passed legislati on mandating the reporting of Autism. Subsequently, with the adoption of legislative rules in 2009, the Registry added the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as reportable diagnoses, and was renamed the Birth Defects & Autism Reporting System (BDARS), expande d the mandatory reporting age for children diagnosed with birth defects up to age 6, and added severe hyperbilirubinemia as a reportable condition. The system refers all living children and their families to our SCHS Case Management Units via the BDARS dir ect link to the Case Management Referral System (CMRS). In 2016, CDC funding , through BCSR continues to assist the Program in making improvements to the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System . TCMRS, Pulse Oximetry, and Exceptional Events Module to improve their ease of operation and efficiency . In order to improve the electronic reporting system, the 3.0 version was developed and instituted in January 2018 . The updated system assists in identifying duplicate registrations by users, thus streamlinin g the reporting process for the user and the processing of the registration by BD AR staff . The 3.0 version will also assist in enhancing parts of the Registry associated with Family Centered Case Management Services , which is done through CMRS . BDAR staff will continue to provide training, on an as -needed basis, to birthing facilities, autism centers, audiologists , and other agencies in the use of the revised electronic BDARS and its modules . Staff will continue to monitor the use of the electronic BDARS and will assist reporting agencies with concerns . In addition, BD AR staff will continue to review the quality of the data in the BDARS and its modules. Site visits will continue to be conducted in each of NJ's birthing hospitals and SCHS CMUs to ensure proper usage of the BDARS and CMRS as needed . FCCS staff review s the CMUs' performance in linking referred families to services. FCCS staff provide ongoing feedback and technical assistance to SCHS CMUs on a statewide, county -level, and individual -level basi s. BDAR staff will continue to work with the agencies to ensure complete and appropriate referral to services. BD AR staff also will be working with non -traditional reporting sources, e.g., FQHCs, and facilities from bordering states to register children with birth defects and/or special health care needs , NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 76 including autism . Building upon information al visits conducted in FFY 2013, FQHCs are continuously encouraged to report children diagnosed in their facilities. Surveillance activities will expand due to the increase in readily available electronic data . These will include identifying any relationships between diagnoses, geographic and temporal patterns, and other descriptive statistics. BDAR was awarded a CDC grant in August 201 6 to conduct a rapid acti ve population -based ascertainment of microcephaly and other select major birth defects possibly linked to maternal Zika virus and to use the data for public health action through monitoring, prevention, and intervention . This grant was a one-year grant tha t ended July of 2017; however, a no cost extension was obtained to continue these efforts until the end July 2018 . Plan for the Application Year State Performance Measure 5: Average age of initial diagnosis for children reported to the NJ Birth Defects & Autism Reporting System (BDARS) with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Annual Indicator SPM #5 4.4 years 4.2 4.6 4.7 4.8 5.3 5.0 5.6 Notes - Data has not yet been subject to quality assurance reviews. SPM #5 was chosen to measure the timeliness of diagnosing autism in children . Early diagnosis is important for initiation of services, as children who receive services at an early age have better functional outcomes . Based on the most recent data available from the B DARS, the average age of initial diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder of children reported to the NJ Autism Registry is 5. 6 years old . Although there is no timeline for diagnosing autism, the Registry encourages all reporting agents to quickly report children diagnosed with the Autism Spectrum Disorder so that families can be linked to SCHS Case Management. While the causes of autism are not known, receiving intensive services early in a child's life can improve development in speech, cognitive, and mo tor skills . Appropriate diagnosis at an early age is an important precursor to ensuring that families gain access to early and intensive intervention . In NJ, the average age of initial diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder of children reported to the Re gistry increased from 4. 4 in 2009 to 5.6 2016 . We believe this is due to increased reporting from behavioral health units who typically treat children with Asperger's Disorder. For instance, in 2016, the average age of a child with Asperger's is considerab ly higher than a child with either autistic disorder and/or pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified, 8.3 years old, versus 5.5, and 7.0 respectively . However, for all children in the registry, the average age of a child with Asperger's is 6.9 years old, a child with autistic disorder is 4.4 years old, and a child with pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified is 4.2 years old. Important activities in the upcoming years that will change the reporting of autism is the rewritin g of the Autism Registry rules and the redesign of the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS) . The new rules tie the reporting to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 criteria for autism spectrum disorders , thus elim inating the reporting of the specific disorders of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified (PDD -NOS). Additionally, a list of common comorbidities, symptoms, and behaviors will be included . Thes e data will provide valuable information for case managers as well as information about phenotypes within the overall population. In order for this performance measure to be accurately determined, patients who are under the age of 22 with autism in NJ need to be reported to the Autism Registry by licensed health care providers who have either diagnosed them or are providing follow -up care and have the full information regarding the child's date of first diagnosis . BDARS staff have conducted outreach to educate and inform physicians and health facilities about the Registry, how they can register children with autism living in NJ, and the rules regarding the Registry . Registry staff have visited and trained staff from medical centers specializing in NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 77 child development, developmental evaluations, and behavioral health . Additionally, they have trained staff from many private pediatric practices that follow older children with autism through annual well visits . Registry staff have also trained several psychiatr ic/behavioral departments located within hospitals . Staff from the Registry presented information concerning the Autism Registry to state and county case managers as part of training on the case management electronic component to the BDARS and they continu e to retrain new staff within health facilities as needed . Staff have also created materials for both providers and families about autism and these materials have been translated into multiple languages including Spanish, Korean, Polish, Hindi, and Arabic . There is also information about the Autism Registry on the DOH website and staff continue to make conference presentations and exhibit , most recently two poster presentations using Autism Registry data were presented at the AMCHP 2018 annual conference in Arlington, VA . NJDOH has also addressed this performance measure by working with the NJ Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Elizabeth M. Boggs Center on Developmental Disabilities, NJ's University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD), in reaching out to various health care providers and distributing information and trainings on the Learn the Signs, Act Early campaign that educates providers on childhood development, including early warning signs of autism and othe r developmental disorders, as well as to encourage developmental screenings and intervention. In addition, the Governor's Council for Medical Research and Treatment of Autism has funded additional clinical centers in their pursuit to create a NJ Autism Cen ter of Excellence (NJACE). NJDOH will continue to focus on the importance of early identification of autism . Registry outreach efforts will continue with harder -to-reach providers such as office -based pediatric offices and those not affiliated with a maj or hospital through mailings and collaboration with other state Departments such as the Department of Education . Providers with less timely reporting to the Registry will continue to be contacted and reminded of the mandate to report and of the importance of the linkage to SCHS Case Management Units . The case management component of the BDARS allow s for an electronic assessment of referral rates . Registry staff are also able to use these reports to monitor timeliness as well as numbers. The NJDOH is commit ted to continuing efforts to reduce th e age of the first diagnosis of autism . The Governor's Council for Medical Research and Treatment of Autism will continue to fund new grantees in their efforts of early identification of autism in children . Additionall y, Early Intervention Systems will continue their efforts with such providers as speech pathologists, occupational therapists and so forth who will act as a basis for early referral of children at risk for autism . Annual Report (Last Year's Accomplishme nts) State Performance Measure 3: Provisional data indicates that for 2017, 76.7% of infants received follow -up after referring on inpatient screening . Since follow -up exams are still occurring on children born at the end of 2013, we expect that the rate will increase when final data is available . We anticipate the final rate will be level with prior years and will exceed the target . Table SPM #3: Percentage of newborns who are discharged from NJ hospitals, reside in NJ, did not pass their newborn hearin g screening and who have outpatient audiological follow -up documented. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 201 7 is incomplete .

NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 78 The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program is responsible for assuring newborn hearing screening goals are met, including assuring timely and ear -specific audiological follow -up for children that d id not pass initial screening. The followi ng activities were completed in 2015 to achieve program goals: During 2017, the EHDI staff worked with the New Jersey Immunization Information System (NJIIS) programmers to create user specifications for revisions to that system. All outpatient audiologic reporting to the EHDI program is submitted via an EHDI module in this system, NJ's immunization registry. The NJIIS program had a complete system rebuild and the EHDI module was also modified to improve information collected about follow -up contacts to parents . The new system went live on January 31, 2018 . Members of the multidisciplinary EHDI Quality Improvement Stakeholder Committee continued regular conference call meetings during 2017. The Plan -Do-Study -Act (PDSA) model of qu ality improvement is being utilized for these activities. A multidisciplinary program advisory group to provide advice to the recipient on potential mechanisms to achieve project objectives and strategies was established in 2017 and met in January 2018. Another meeting is set for April 2018. The group will again convene in fall/winter 2018. Collaboration with the NJ Division of Consumer Affairs resulted in development of a comprehensive list of all current NJ licensed audiologists and hearing aid dispenser s to be used for outreach to these professional for inclusion in the annual update to the NJ EHDI Pediatric Hearing Health Care Directory ( www.hearinghelp4kids.nj.gov ). This free, online Directory provide s listings of hearing health care professionals who provide services to children from birth to 21 years of age. Trained 1 7 new users on the EHDI reporting module in the NJ Immunization Information System (NJIIS) which is used by audiologists and other pra ctitioners who are conducting hearing follow - up to report outpatient exams. The EHDI program receives approximately 89% of reports entered by providers through this Web -based application and the rest are sent to the program on paper forms. Continued use o f HRSA EHDI grant funding for county -based special child health services case management staff to conduct follow -up phone calls to parents and physicians of children in need of hearing follow -up. During 201 7 the case managers contacted 595 families. Conti nued use of HRSA EHDI grant funding for one of the Early Intervention (EI) program's Regional Early Intervention Collaborative's (REIC) to provide two part -time consultants who specialize in working wi th children with hearing loss. They have an initial pho ne conversation with parents of children who have recently been diagnosed with hearing loss to review EI services and discuss communication options f or children with hearing loss. The consultants participate in the initial early intervention family meeting s via remote access, using laptops with web -cameras . The consultants served a total of 128 families during the year. The EHDI Monthly Reconciliation Report is distributed to individual hospitals detailing children still in need of additional audiological follow -up after not passing inpatient hearing screening. This serves as a notice to hospitals of babies stil l in need of reminder contact. In addition, a report including statistics comparing the individual hospital to statewide statistical averages is sent annually. Continued annual distribution of a report to provide audiology facilities with feedback on the timeliness of follow -up for children seen at their facility after not passin g inpatient hearing screening. The report also includes statistics on the timeliness and completeness of the documentation of their results.

In 2017, in -person presentations included presentations to the NJ Department of Human Services Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Advis ory Committee and to the New York Mid -Atlantic Consortium for Genetic and Newborn Screening Services Medical Home Learning Session. In 2017, a breakout session about baby friendly hospitals in NJ and attitudes about bedside vs other location hearing screen ing and a poster presentation were given at the 2017 National Early Hearing Detection and Intervent ion Conference in Atlanta, GA. The Baby Friendly presentation was also given as a webinar to NJ Hospital contact people and other interested hospital and com mittee colleagues. In 2017 an in -person meeting of all three Learning Communities was offered at The University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro . In 2017, an audiology -based webinar was presented in collaboration with Utah State University & the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management on pediatric hearing loss counseling issues. In collaboration with the Utah CMV Council and NJ AAP, NJ EHDI held a webinar in 2017, to increase knowledge and awareness about congenital CMV infection for NJ hospital EHDI coordinators and other interested health care professionals (as part of National CMV awareness month). In 2018, two posters were presented by NJ EHDI at the National Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Conference in Denver, CO, one o f which won the Outstanding Poster in the area of EHDI Work force. A total of 3 meetings were held for the Hearing Evaluation Council, which is a Commissioner appointed advisory board to the NJ EHDI program. The HEC is made up of a pediatrician, otolaryngol ogist, an audiologist, a child of Deaf adults, a member of the Deaf community, a hard of hearing individual and citizens of the State who are interested in the welfare of children with hearing loss (which includes a parent of a children with hearing loss and a teacher of the Deaf. In 2017, the NJ EHDI audiologist, in collaboration with the NJ Medicaid Program and the only 2 manufacturers of bone anchored hearing system technology met over several months to rectify billing issues that prevented fitting of t hese devices on infants and children with external auditory canal atresia and single sided deafness through the establishment of billing codes that were previously unavailable to the NJ Medicaid recipients. Throughout 2017, there was a continuation of the collaborative NJ EHDI, Family Centered Care and NJAAP pediatric hearing health care outreach initiative to Special Child Health Services. 10 monthly topics/case studies and questions of the month were sent t o all 51 SCHS Case Managers. b. Annual Report (Last Year's Accomplishments) State Performance Measure 4 : NJ has been very successful in linking children registered with the Birth Defects Registry ( BDAR ) (also known as the Special Child Health Services Registry) with services offered through our county -based Special Child Health Services Case Management Units (CMUs) . However, the system did not track children and families to determine if and what services were offered to any of the registered children . To address this weakness, added in 2012, the Case Management Referral Systems (CMRS) is used by the CMUs to track and monitor services provided to the children and their families . It electronically notifies a CMU when a child living within their county has been registered and released for follow -up. Also included in CMRS is the ability to create and modify an Individual Service Plan (ISP), track services, create a record of each contact with the child and child's family, create standardized quarterly reports and register previously unregistered children. State Performance Measure 4: Percent of live children registered with the Birth Defects and Autism Reporting System (BDARS) who have been referred to NJ's Special Child Health Services Case Management Unit who are receiving services . NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 80 2012 2013 2014 2015 2015 2016 2017 Annual Indicator SPM Beginning i n 2014, definitions and inclusion criteria were expanded. The numerator reflects all children whose record has any of the five following criteria for services: 1. Case closed within FFY with a reason of \"goals achieved\" , 2. Child referred to Early Interventi on within FFY , 3. Individual Services documented with a begin and/or end date within FFY , 4. Individual Service Objectives documented with a perform date within FFY , and 5. Case Management Actions (excluding any letter correspondence that is part of an ini tial letter series) documented with a date performed within FFY . These children must have received any of these services within a given FFY and registered with the BDARS (registration date not restricted to FFY). The denominator represents the number of c hildren served by SCHS Case Management in FFY who had been registered with the BDARS regardless of registration date (i.e., the numerator) plus any additional children who were registered and released to case management within a given FFY but did not recei ve services as currently defined (FFY17 n=1,250). CMRS allows CMUs to receive registrations in real time, enables faster family contact, and more rapidly assists a registered child in gaining access to appropriate health and education services. In 2013, CDC continued to fund the BDARS through a cooperative agreement for improvements in the Birth Defects Surveillance system. Rutgers, Bloustein Center for Survey Research (BCSR) deployed CMRS for the BDARS and d uring and after deployment, the BCSR c ontinued to work with staff from both the EIM Program and the SCHS county -based CMUs to identify and correct issues in the case tracking and management component of the BDARS . In 2014, within the CMRS component of BDARS, the BCSR created and implemented an Exceptional Event module in collaboration with BDAR and Family Centered Care Services (FCCS) staff. The Exceptional Event module was originally intended to track families affected by Super Storm Sandy using Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds. Howeve r, team collaboration suggested the expansion and adaptability of this module to track other natural disasters, interpersonal family crises, and other 'exceptional events' that may impact the needs of children with special health care needs and their famil y, including the youth's transition to adulthood. In 2016, FCCS provided funds to BCSR to further expand CMRS to include additional tracking for the Medical Home for CYSHCN initiative . These additional components have been incorporated into NPM reporting . The Pulse Oximet ry Module continues to collect information on children who failed their newborn pulse oximetry screening test, which is used to identify children at risk for CCHD, which may not be apparent at birth. NJ is the first state in the nation to integrate the CCHD screening with their birth defects registry . Each month EIM Program staff review information from the Pulse Oximetry Module to determine the final diagnosis of a child who failed the screening test . This review involves determining whet her the child has been diagnosed with a CCHD by reviewing BDARS registrations and contacting the hospital that performed the screening test. BDAR staff continued to provide training to birthing facilities, autism centers, and CMUs in the use of the electr onic BDARS. They also continued to assist the units as they transition from the paper -based system to the electronic system. In 2014, the SCHS Registry: Processed registrations for over 9,200 children with birth defects and other special health needs, NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 81 Referred nearly 7,400 families to the SCHS CMUs, and Received over 2,400 new autism -related registrations, excluding anonymous registrations. BDAR staff continues to collaborate with staff from FCCS and BCSR to identify and correct issues related to the BDARS and the CMRS to improve its ease of use and efficiency . In 201 7, CDC continues to fund the Program through a cooperative agreement for improvements in the Birth Defects Surveillance System . The BCRS will continue making improvements to the BDARS, CMRS, and the Pulse Oximetry and Exceptional Event Module s. The BDAR staff will continue to work with the hospitals and other agencies to ensure complete reporting, especially with the birthing hospitals to ensure all children who failed their pulse oximet ry screening test are reported through the BDARS. Site visits will be conducted in each of NJ's birthing hospitals to audit their reporting through the BDARS . Facilities having the lowest levels of appropriate reporting, based upon results of the audits, will receive remedial assistance from staff of the BD AR. The BD AR staff will continue to identify non -traditional reporting sources, e.g., FQHC, as a means to ensure all families with special health care needs children will be identified and referred to th e appropriate CMU for services. FCCS staff revised annual site visit audits to include protocol -based review of electronic records in CMRS. In these electronic record reviews, staff assessed key functions and expectations of the CMUs and evaluated Individ ual Service Plans to assess linkage to services. FCCS staff continues to review electronic documentation of the six key performance indicators (e.g., medical home, transition to adulthood), with an expectation of refining how this information is collected within CMRS. b. Annual Report (Last Year's Accomplishments) State Performance Measure 5: The NJ Autism Registry is the largest mandated autism registry in the country with over 25,000 children registered as of November 201 7. We are the only registry in the country that includes children up to the age of 22 and refers them to case management services . We serve as a model registry and continue to provide technical assistance with other states considering a Registry, such as Massachusetts. In FY 2014, over 1,800 children were newly reported to the BDARS including all children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified and who had information about the date of first diagnosis. Staff has stressed the importance of quickly reporting children diagnosed as having autism by continuing to provide outreach about the Autism Registry through conference presentations and focused meetings. Staff participated in several exhibits including the Annual School Health Conference sponsored by the NJ Chapter of the AAP and have presented to a number of private pediatric offices throughout NJ. Staff continues to send out mailings on a perio dic basis to newly identified providers and have recently deployed a new Autism Registry logo and webpage ( http://nj.gov/health/fhs/autism/public/registry/ ) which will include information for parents, providers, and researchers. Providers with untimely re porting were contacted and reminded of the mandate to report and of the importance of the linkage to SCHS CMUs. The electronic reporting component of the BDARS facilitated timelier reporting by facilities and since the BDARS added the SCHS CMU component, r eferral of these children to services is significantly faster. A specific target for this current year was the annual audit s with hospitals and other autism reporting facilities in conjunction with the Birth Defects quality assurance audits .

Cross -cutting or Systems Building This section concerning the domain of Life Course includes the SPN #8 Improving Integration of Information Systems and SPN #8 Smoking Prevention and the NPM #13 Oral Health and #14 Household Smoking . SPN #8 was added as a SPN recognizing the adverse impact of smoking on all population domains and many NPMs and NOMs. Plan for the Application Year - NPM #13: A) Percent of women who had a dental visit during pregnancy and B) Percent of children, ages 1 through 17, who had a preventive dental visit in the past year Oral health is an important part of general health. The second selected NPM in the domain of Child Health is NPM #13A (Percent of women who had a dental visit during pregnancy) and #13B (Percent of children, ages 1 through 17, who had a preventive dental visit in the past year). Access to oral health care, good oral hygiene, and adequate nutrition are essential component s of oral health that help to ensure children, adolescents, and adults achieve and maintain oral health throughout the lifespan. People with limited access to preventive oral health services are at greater risk for oral diseases. Oral health care remains the greatest unmet health need for children. Insufficient access to oral health care and effective preventive services affects children's health, education, and ability to learn . According to the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pedi atric Dentistry, the dental visit should occur within six months after the baby's first tooth appears, but no later than the child's first birthday. Having the first dental visit by age 1 teaches children and families that oral health is important. Childre n who receive oral health care early in life are more likely to have a positive attitude about oral health professionals and dental exams. Pregnant women who receive oral health care are more likely to take their children for regular dental check -ups. State Title V Maternal Child Health programs have long recognized the importance of improving the availability and quality of services to improve oral health for children and pregnant women. States monitor and guide service delivery to assure that all chil dren have access to preventive oral health services. Strategies for promoting good oral health include : providing preventive interventions such as age appropriate oral health education, promoting the application of de ntal sealants and the use of fluoride, increasing the capacity of state oral health programs to provide preventive services , evaluating and improving methods of monitoring oral disease , and increasing the number of community health centers with an oral health component.

The ESM was selected since all oral health education activities conducted in the school and community setti ngs serve to improve the oral health status of school age children. The COHP provides age -appropriate oral health and hygiene education, healthy food choice selection, smoke, smoke -less and spit tobacco cessation, and oral injury prevention education along with mouth -guard distribution to prevent oral injury in areas of high need, high risk, where the water is not optimally fluoridated. In addition, numerous special initiatives take place including, \"Sugar -less Day to Prevent Tooth Decay, \"Projects: BRUSH, PEDs and REACH, and Project SMILE which not only educate students about the importance of preventive oral health practices but also serves to increase family and community NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 83 awareness due to family and community engagement. In addition, every 2 years, the NJ Department of Health updates the Dental Clinic Directory, \"Dial a Smile\" that serves as a public resource to assist in identifying providers of clinical dental services. Assisting students and families to establish a dental home helps them to receive regu lar dental check -ups and serves to assist in the elimination of costly emergency room dental visits. The \"Be a Smart Mouth\" oral health Home Visiting Initiative targets first time families and engages the family in oral health and hygiene dialogue. Through the \"Be a Smart Mouth\" Initiative, NJ home visiting staff are trained to assist fami lies to establish a dental home while educating them about good oral health and hygiene practices. Plan for the Application Year - NPM #14: A) Percent of women who smoke during pregnancy and B) Percent of children who live in households where someone smokes Adverse effects of parental smoking on children have been a clinical and public health concern for decades and were documented in the 1986 U.S. Surgeon General 's Report. Unfortunately, millions (more than 60%) of children are exposed to secondhand smoke in their homes. These children have an increased frequency of ear infections; acute respiratory illnesses and related hospital admissions during infancy; severe as thma and asthma -related problems; lower respiratory tract infections leading to 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations annually in children under 18 months; and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). As a result of the many health consequences, the health costs f rom smoking in pregnancy are significant . The excess costs for prenatal care and complicated births among pregnant women who s moke exceed $4 billion a year. It has been estimated that a 1% drop in rates of smoking among pregnant women could result in a sav ings to the US of $21 million in direct me dical costs in the first year. Another $572 million in direct costs could be saved if the rates continued to drop by 1% a year over seven years. Second hand smoke also has significan t health effects on an infant. Pregnant women exposed to second hand smoke have a 20% incr eased risk of having an infant born with low birth weight , and secondhand smoke exposure also increases the risk for infections in the infa nt, and even death from SIDS. Children living with smokers are also more likely to get asthma attacks, ear infections, and serious respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and bronchitis due to secondhand smoke. The cost to care for childhood illnesses resulting from exposure to secondhand smoke is estimated at $8 bil lion a ye ar. In addition to the effects during the perinatal period, health consequences for older children and adults (whether from directly smoking or from a secondhand exposure) are well documented in the literature and include respiratory infections an d disease, cancer, and death. ESM 14.1 was selected to monitor and promote preventive dental services among NJ children enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.

Train statewide pren atal providers to generate an automatic electronic referral for pregnant smokers identified during the Perinatal Risk Assessment (PRA) process. The Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative is currently piloting PRA electronic referral to MQC in four pilot sites in the South. PRA is being used more and more frequently in the state and an automatic referral would increase the reach of MQC across NJ. Conduct an extensive public awareness campaign about the availability of MQC for pregnant women who smoke. Use no-cost and low -cost television and radio advertisements, many of which are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Increas ing Capacity for Direct Service in NJ ; Continue to expand MQC's existing services to enable face -to-face cou nseling in the Northern and Central regions of the state, handle increased volume of calls and requests for face-to-face counseling resulting from outreach activities, and expand activities into the postpartum period to decrease the likelihood of relapse. While MQC does not currently turn away postpartum women, because of limited funding, they do not actively outreach to or offer program ming spec ifically for postpartum women. Because of the high relapse rate in postpartum women, it is essential to expand progra mming to address this population's needs. Prevent ing relapse after delivery ; Develop Pregnant Smoker to Stay Quit Mom interactive online app and social networking site to connect women with cessation services, provide mechanism for registering/intak e survey, offer stay quit support (e.g , online chat groups for parenting moms), and provide targeted and general cessation information. Develop a personalized quit plan using the newly developed online app and send personalized Text to Quit messages to pr egnant women and new mothers. Preventing young people from starting to use tobacco is the key to reducing the death and disease caused by tobacco use. Adolescent smoking and smokeless tobacco use are the first steps in a preventable public health tragedy. Adolescent users become adult users, and few people begin to use tobac co after age 18. Current cigarette use among NJ high school students declined sharply during 1997 -2003; however, rates have remained relatively stable over the past several years . In addition to price increases, several strategies can achieve a substantial reduction in youth consumption. These include limiting youth access to tobacco, strong community -based programs concentrating on secondhand smoke, mass media campaigns combined with community -wide interventions, and evidence -based school health programs. However, initiatives to reduce youth smoking must be maintained and accompanied by changes in adult behavior. Policy makers must consider approaches that sustain dela yed initiation in to adulthood. Comprehensive, effective, and sustainable tobacco -control programs, as well as tobacco cessation programs, are essential to reduce tobacco - caused disease, death and disability. Annual Report ( Last Year's Accomplishments ) Annual Report NPM # 13: A) Percent of women who had a dental visit during pregnancy and B) Percent of children, ages 1 through 17, who had a preventive dental visit in the past year The Children's Oral Hea lth Program (COHP) has over a 31 -year history of providing interactive, age - appropriate oral health education programs to school -age children throughout the State. During the 201 6- 2017 school year, approximately 70,000 students in high -risk areas where the water is not optimally NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 85 fluoridated received oral health/hy giene education and oral health personal care resources. During that school year, over 1 1,500 students participate d in the voluntary school -based fluoride mouth rinse program, \"Save Our Smiles,\" and over 2,0 00 kindergarten and first -grade students participated in the Project: BRUSH initiative that engaged the school and local community with oral health messages throughout the year. Other key programs included \"Sugar -Less Day to Prevent Tooth Decay\" carried out in the 21 cou nties of the State with ov er 1,500 fourth -grade students participating. Efforts to target multidisciplinary obstetric, pediatric, medical, nursing and home visiting staff resulted in educating approximately 5,100 providers through train -the-trainer efforts to incorporate oral healt h care instruction in the patient and home visiting setting. During 201 8, the NJ Dental Clinic Directory, \"Dial a Smile\" was updated and distributed to over 3,500 school nurses, WIC sites, summer camps, special needs children's programs , and the NJ Home Visiting Programs in efforts to assist clients in securing a dental home and increasing access to dental care services. Staff use the Directory to refer individuals for dental care services and assist them to establish a dental home. Use of the Directory h elps to reduce costly hospital emergency room care for non -traumatic dental services and increases the use of the Statewide network of Federally Qualified Health Centers. A variety of publications including the \"Miles of Smiles\" annual school newsletter was mailed to over 3,300 schools while the \"Oral Health Facts for Women, Infants, and Children\" newsletter was provided for WIC Coordinators throughout the State. Project: REACH, \"Reducing Early Childhood Caries through Access to Care and Health Educati on,\" is an oral health education initiative targeting a multidisciplinary obstetric staff in federally qualified health centers throu ghout the State reached 1,715 pregnant women emphasizing the oral -systemic health link and providing resources for dental c are referral . Women receive \"Oral Health Care Starter Kits\" for personal and infant oral health care. Project PEDs,\" Pediatricians Preventing Early Dental Disease\" continued to be implemented in select FQHC sites as a train -the-trainer model reaching 653 patients. The initiative highlights the importance of engaging and educating a multidisciplinary pediatric staff regarding the importance of addressing oral health care and referral for dental services during the well child visit. NJ has developed and im plemented the \"Be a Smart Mouth\" oral health component for home visiting programs that was implemented in 2014. Through a Statewide effort, over 7,000 families participating in the MIECHV Program were reached and provided oral health education and personal care resources. Families were assisted in establishing a dental home and encouraged to have regular dental exams. In 2017, the COHP continued to develop and implement cutting edge programs such as the continuation of the \"Be a Smart Mouth: Home Visiting a nd Oral Health Perfect Together! Initiative. The integration of oral health into the home visiting program allows trained staff to provide oral health and hygiene instruction and healthy food choices education to first time families. In addition, families were assisted to establish a dental home which helps to reduce hospital emergency room dental visits thereby reducing health care costs. Program efforts continued in 201 7 with over 4,693 families reached by staff from the 3 NJ Home Visiting model programs . Training included good oral health practices while educating families about the importance of health literacy by reinforcing the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement promoting early literacy development. Families received an oral health care ki t that included an age - appropriate story book encouraging parents to read to their children on a daily basis as part of a nightly oral health care toothbrushing routine. Given the success of \"Be a Smart Mouth,\" the Program will be highlighted in the NJ Bes t Practice Collection of the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors. In response to a request from the National Maternal Child Health Resource Center seeking information pertaining to home visiting programs with an oral health component, NJ provided an over view of the \"Be a Smart Mouth\" oral health training program for review and potential replication on a national level . Program promotion efforts will continue to emphasize \"Be a Smart Mouth\" as a cost -effective model for replication on a na tional level with the goal of increasing the number of first -time families who have a dental home and receive a preventive dental visit. Home visiting staff report families consistently sharing \"appreciation for the oral health resources.\" In addition, dur ing trainings staff shared their experiences of NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 86 the on -going oral health dialogue with families that included, \"use of oral health products, reminder to take the child to the dentist along with usefulness of oral health resources.\" Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) program offers comprehensive preventi ve child health services to all Medicaid -eligible children under age 21 including periodic physical exams; hearing, vision and developmental screenings; screening children for elevated blood lead levels ; vaccines; health education; and dental inspections a nd referrals . Medicaid in NJ is administered by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) in the NJ Department of Human Services . The performance on this indicator has improved greatly and according to the 2017 Annual EPSDT Participati on Report . In aligning with the national trend to incorporate an oral health education component into nursing curriculum, the Director, Children's Oral Health Program explored options to include an oral health component into the maternity, pediatric and community health clinical experiences at Schools of Nursing in NJ. During 201 7, the College of New Jersey, School of Nursing, Health and Exercise Science partnered with the Children's Oral Health Program to implement an oral health and hygiene and oral health literary initiative for the community health nursing clinical component for senior level nursing students. This special initiative, \"Bedtime Bytes\" was funded by the Dental Trade Alliance with additional support from the NJ Department of Health. The ov erarching goal was to increase oral health literacy, assist in the establishment of a dental home, and improve the oral health status of high -risk children while emphasizing the integration of oral health education in School of Nursing curriculum. Annual Report ( Last Year's Accomplishments ) National Performance Measure 14: Initiated in 2001 with funding from the NJDOH -Comprehensive Tobacco Control Program, Mom's Quit Connection (MQC) is NJ's maternal child health smoking cessation program. There have be en changes in the services provided and their capacity to be a statewide program through the years based on availability of funds. MQC's trained Tobacco Dependence Specialists utilize a proactive behavior modification model, offering face -to-face individua l counseling at the referring health care facility, onsite group counseling or telephone counseling to assist clients in devel oping a customized quit plan. The program was expanded during FY 2015 and Mom's Quit Connection (MQC) was able to develop a multi -pronged and comprehensive statewide approach to perinatal smoking cessation activities. The new activities include: Promoting Mom's Quit Connection (MQC) in order to further expand its reach to pregnant and parenting mothers in NJ. Increasing capacity of Mom's Quit Connection with respect to direct services for pregnant and parenting mothers statewide. Preventing relapse after delivery. MQC provides free onsite Ask, Advise, and Refer Brief Intervention training to maternal -child healthcare providers, hosp ital staff and physicians, medical and nursing schools, MCH consortia, medical associations, community and social service agencies statewide. Upon completing the training, MQC provides technical assistance to clinicians and office staff in implementing the fax to quit referral process and ongoing cessation support a s a routine component of care. From July 1, 2016 thru June 30, 2017, there were a total of 1,332 referrals to the program, 331 from the Central region; 298 from the Northern region: 11 unknown a nd 692 from the Southern region, reflecting MQC's long standing history in the southern counties, as well as the higher adult smo king rates found in the south. 969 of these referrals came from the automated Perinatal Risk Assessment (PRA) system, 291 were faxed in by providers, and 72 were client self -referrals -typically made from the MQC website and Facebook pa ge online registration option. Every referred client is sent information and given the option of enrolling in MQC 's cession counseling program. Of the 109 enrolled clients, 73.9% of the pregnant and NJ MCH BLOCK GRANT FY19 NARRATIVE DRAFT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STATE ACTION PLAN SECTION NJ MCH BG 2019 Narrative for Publi c Comment May 2018 87 postpartum women quit or significantly reduced their consumption: of the interconception clients, 63.6% quit or sign ificantly reduced consumption. Amongst the enrolled pregnant clients, the quit rates was just under 27%, remaining higher than the national 24% maternal quit rate, with relapse rates at about 4.5% . During this year, the 109 open clients received 592 counseling sessions, of which 460 were face to face, 129 wer e by phone and 3 were by text. 420 family members and caregivers were referred to the NJ Quitline as a result of the mom being enrolled in MQC. MQC provides free on -site Ask, Advise and Refer Brief Intervention training to maternal and child health physicians, nurses, medical and nursing s tudent staff, professional and para professional office, social service and community agency staff statewide. This year, MQC staff utilized the training of new PRA staff across the state as an opportunity to orient new providers about MQC and its services, as well as offer AAR training on incorporating brief interventi on into routine prenatal care. From July 2016 thru June 2017, there were a total of 43 Ask Advise and Refer provider trainings conducted for a total of 602 professionals, and an additional 124 were trained via a webinar co - sponsored by Mar ch of Dimes and National ACOG. An additional 1,240 professionals received orientation sessions about MQC and the NJ Quitline, and a total of 1,885 pregnant women and parents received formal education about MQ C services. Other Program Activities During CY 2017, the Family Health Line received and assisted 5,362 calls and made 6,341 referrals . The Reproductive and Perinatal Health Services monitors the grant with the Family Health Line that is a component of the Center for Family Services, Inc. The Reproductive and Perinatal Health Services provides the Family Health Line with consultation, technical assistance and educational material support to facilitate its participation in community events and networking. The Family Health Line employs three clinical staff members who are responsible to answer the Perinatal Mood Disorders Speak Up When You're Down calls. They screen the callers and coordinate working with Mental Health Providers . Emerging Issues Emerg ing MCH Issues have been included in the State Action Plan narrative and include Obesity, Nutrition, Autism and Improving and Integrating Information Systems. These issues have been considered emerging issues for several years and their importance recogniz ed by State Priority Needs (#2 Improving Nutrition & Physical Activity and #7 Improving & Integrating Information Systems ) and State Performance Measures (#5 Age of Initial Autism Diagnosis ). Zika virus infections and related birth defects is a recent eme rging issue that will require expanded partnerships and collaboration across Departments to be adequately addressed. The NJDOH has formed a Department -wide work group to coordinate a statewide response. In response the Zika Virus, Family Health Services, NJ MCH Title V programs have initiated an extensive campaign to prepare and respond to the public health risks posed by the Zika virus in collaboration with NJDOH Communicable Disease Services. Standard of Procedure protocols have been created and implemen ted to navigate pregnant women and infants through care linkage and follow up, and systems have been created to supply data collection for surveillance as set forth by th e CDC Zika Pregnancy Registry. Education sessions are also planned for the healthcare providers, patients and the general public. Adequate capacity to address the early identification and treatment of CYSHCN with Zika and its sequelae, secondary and tertiary prevention, and linkage to timely and appropriate follow -up are emerging issues of concern for the FCCS program; SCHS CM, SPSP, and Ryan Whit e Part D, and Fee for Service. According to the CDC, as of April 2017, NJ ranks fifth among States with laboratory - confirmed symptom atic Zika virus disease cases. Although at this time very few Zik a confirmed newborns have been referred to FCCS' programs, NJ remains vigilant for the potential increased demand on its current comprehensive system of care.
