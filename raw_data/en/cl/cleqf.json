Such civil action shall be brought in the district court of the county in which the violation of the standard or reg ulation is alleg ed to have occurred. (2) Upon finding that a final enforcement order of the department has been viola ted and that the violation of the standard or regulation described in the order in fact occurred, the court shall: (a) Impose a civil penalty on the violator of not more than one thousand dollars per day for each day the violation of the standard or regulation occurred if the court determines the violation was willful; or (b) Enter such order as the public health may require, taking into consideration, where appropriate, the cost and time necessary to comply ; or (c) I mpose such civil penalty and enter such order. (2.5) (a) Any person who violates any minimum general sanitary standard and regulation promulg ated pursuant to section 25-1.5-202 or 25-1-114 (1)(h), or any final enforcement order issued by the department, shall be subject to an administrative penalty as follows: (I) For systems that serve a population of more than ten thousand people, an amount not to ex ceed one thousand dollars per violation per day ; or (II) For systems that serve a population of ten thousand people or less, an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars per violation per day, but only in an amount, as determine d by the division, that is necessary to ensure compliance. (b) Penalties under this subsection (2.5) shall be determined by the executive director or the executive director' s desig nee and may be collected by the division of administration by an action instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction for collection of such penalty . The final decision of the executive director or the executive director' s desig nee may be appealed to the water quality control commission, created pursuant to section 25-8-201. A stay of any order of the division ending judicial review shall not relieve any person from any liability with respect to past or continuing violations of any minimum general sanitary standard or any regulation promulg ated pursuant to section 25-1.5-202 or 25-1-114 (1)(h), but the reason for the request for judicial review shall be considered in the determination of the amount of the penalty . In the event that such an action is instituted for the collection of such penalty, the court may consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty , if such issue is raised by the party against Page 20 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutwhom the penalty was assessed. Any administrative penalty collected under this section shall be credited to the g eneral fund. (3) The department may request the attorney general to bring a suit for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction to prevent or abate any violation of a minimu m general sanitary standard or regulation adopted pursuant to section 25-1.5-202 or to prevent or abate any release or imminent release that causes or is likely to cause contamination resulting in liability under section 25-1.5-207, and the department, in such a suit, may collect, on behalf of political subdivisions or public water systems, the damag es incurred by such political subdivisions or public water systems under section 25-1.5-207. The department shall pay to such political subdi visions or public water systems all damag es collected on their behalf. The department is not required to issue an enforcement order prior to institution of such a suit. Upon a de novo finding by the court that such a violation has occurred, is occurring , or is about to occur or that such release or immin ent release exists, the court may enjoin such violation, release, or imminent release and enter such order as the public health may require, taking into consideration, where appropriate, the cost and time necessary to comply .

(4) Suits broug ht pursuant to subsection (3) of this section shall be broug ht in the district court of the county in which the violatio n is alleged to have occurred. The institution of such a suit by the division of administr ation shall confer upon such court exclusive jurisdiction to determine finally the subject matter of the proceeding ; except that the exclusive jurisdiction of the court shall apply only to such proceeding and shall not preclude assessment of any civil penalties or any other enforcement action or sanction authoriz ed by this section. (4.5) An action for civil penalties under this section may be joined with a civil action to recover the state' s costs pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. (5) The powers of the department estab lished by this section shall be in addition to, and not in derog ation of, any powers of the department. (6) (a) The attorney general, at the request of the department, or the district attorney of the county in which an affected public water system is located or the attorney of the supplier of water may institute a civil action against any person, association, or corporation, or the officers thereof, who tampers, attempts to tamper, or threatens to tamper with a public water system or with drinking water after its withdrawal for or treatment by a public water system. Such actio n shall be brought in the district court of the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred. As used in this subsection (6), \"tamper\" means to introduce a contaminant into a public water system or into drinking water or to otherwise interfere with drinking water or the operation of a public water system with the intention of harming persons or public water systems. \"Tamper\" does not include the standardiz ed and accepted treatment procedures performed by a supplier of water in preparing water for human consumption. (b) Upon finding that tampering , attempting to tamper, or threatening to tamper has occurred, the court shall have the authority to: (I) Order appropriate injunctive relief; Page 21 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(II) Impose a civil penalty on the violator of not more than fifty thousand dollars for each act of tampering or of not more than twenty thousand dollars for each act of attempting to tamper or threatening to tamper; (III) Impose on the violator all costs incurred by the state and by the affected public water system in assessing and remedy ing all consequences of the tampering , attempt ing to tamper, or threatening to tamper; and (IV) Impose on the violator all court costs associated with remedy ing consequences of the tampering , attempting to tamper, or threatening to tamper. (7) Any person subject to an action broug ht pursuant to subsection (3) of this section or section 25-1.5-207 shall have an affirmative defense to such action if such person' s potential liability results from a discharg e of contaminants or substances authoriz ed by and in substantial compliance with an existing federal or state permit which controls the quality of the release of the contaminant or substance.

Voluntary disclosure arising from self-evaluation - presum ption against imposition of adm inistrative or civil penalties. (1) For the purposes of this section , a disclosure of information by a person or entity to any division or agency within the department of public health and environment regarding any informat ion related to an environmental law is voluntary if all of the following are true: (a) The disclosure is made promptly after knowledg e of the information disclosed is obtained by the person or entity ; (b) The disclosure arises out of a voluntary self-evaluation; (c) The person or entity making the disclosure initiates the appropriate effort to achieve compliance, pursues compliance with due diligence, and corrects the noncompliance within two years after the completion of the voluntary self-evaluation. Where such evidence shows the noncompliance is the failur e to obtain a permit, appropriate efforts to correct the noncompliance may be demonstrated by the submittal of a complete permit application within a reasonable time. (d) The person or entity making the disclosure cooperates with the appropriate division or agency in the department of public health and environment regarding investig ation of the issues identified in the disclosure. (2) For the purposes of parag raph (c) of subsection (1) of this section, upon application to and at the discretion of the department of public health and environment, the time period within which the noncompliance is required to be corrected may be extended if it is not practi cable to correct the noncompliance within the two-y ear period. A request for a de novo review of the decision of the department of public health and environment may be made to the appropriate district court or administrative law judg e. (3) If a person or entity is required to make a disclosure to a division or agency within the department of public healt h and environment under a specific permit condition or under an Page 22 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutorder issued by the division or agency, then the disclosure is not voluntary with respect to that division or ag ency. (4) If any person or entity makes a voluntary disclosure of an environmental violat ion to a division or agency within the department of public health and environment , then there is a rebuttable presumption that the disclosure is voluntary and therefore the person or entity is immune from any administrative and civil penalties associated with the issues discl osed and is immune from any criminal penalties for negligent acts associated with the issues disclosed. The person or entity shall provide information supporting its claim that the disclosure is voluntary at the time that the disclosure is made to the division or ag ency. (5) To rebut the presumption that a disclosure is voluntary , the appropriate division or agency shall show to the satisfaction of the respective commission in the department of public health and environment or the state board of health, if no respective commission exists, that the disclosure was not voluntary based upon the factors set forth in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section. A decision by the commission or the state board of health, whichever is appropriate, regarding the voluntary nature of a disclosure is final agency action. The division or agency may not include any administrative or civil penalty or fine or any criminal penalty or fine for negligent acts in a notice of violation or in a cease- and-desist order on any underly ing environmental violation that is alleg ed absent a finding by the respective commission or the state board of health that the division or agency has rebutted the presumption of voluntariness of the disclosure. The burden to rebut the presumption of voluntariness is on the division or ag ency. (6) The elimination of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties under this section does not apply if a person or entity has been found by a court or administrative law judge to have committed serious violations that constitute a pattern of contin uous or repeated violations of environmental laws, rules, regulations, permit conditions, settlement agreements, or orders on consent and that were due to separate and distinct events giving rise to the violations, withi n the three-y ear period prior to the date of the disclosure. Such a pattern of continuous or repeated violations may also be demonstrated by multiple settlement agreements related to substantially the same alleg ed violations concerning serious instances of noncompliance with environmental laws that occurred within the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date of the voluntary disclosure. (7) Except as specifically provided in this section, this section does not affect any authority the department of public health and environment has to require any action associated with the information disclosed in any voluntary disclosure of an environmental violation. (8) Unless the contex t otherwise requires, the definitions contained in section 13-25- 126.5 (2), C.R.S., apply to this section. (9) This section applies to voluntary disclosures that are made and voluntary self- evaluations that are performed on or after J une 1, 1994.

(1) (a) The general assem bly hereby finds and determines that, in order to encourag e the regulated community to utilize the environmental self-audit provisions contained in this sectio n and sections 25-1-114.5, 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., a pilot project is established. The general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of the environme ntal self-audit provisions contained in this 126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., is to encourag e the regulated commun ity to voluntarily identify environmental concerns and to address them expeditiously without fear of enforcement action by regulatory agencies. The general assembly recog nizes that, due to concerns with the environmental self-audit provisions, the United States environmental protection agency has, in the past, taken direct action against entities in the regulated comm unity that have made disclosures under the environmental self-audit provisions. The general assembly further declares that the pilot project enacted by this section is inten ded to allow entities to proceed under the environmental self-audit provisions with assurance that, if any such entity complies with such environmental self-audit provisions, the United States environmental protection agency will foreg o any enforcement action based on the disclosures made and addressed under the environmental self-audit pilot project. (b) The general assembly further recog nizes that, under the pilot project enacted by this section, the department of public health and environment will have discretion to consider certain factors in assessing a regulated entity 's eligibility for penalty immunity under the environmental laws. The general assemb ly intends that this additional flexibility to assess an entity 's eligibility , along with the protecti on from federal overfiling that the pilot project provides, will encourag e entities to participate in the project and allow the departmen t of public health and environment to assess the effectiveness of the environmental self-audit provisions. (c) The provisions of this section shall only apply to disclosures made under this section and sections 25-1-114.5, 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., after the department of public health and environment and the United States environm ental protection agency have entered into a memorandum of agreement binding Colorado and the federal government to enforce environmental laws in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 25-1-114.5 (4) and (5), 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., on and after May 30, 2000, the department of public health and environment may assess penalties for criminal negligence when available under federal environmental law. (3) (a) In addition to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, notwithstanding the provisions of sectio ns 25-1-114.5 (4) and (5), 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., on and after May 30, 2000, in determining whether an entity is entitled to penalty immunity under the provisions of section 25-1-114.5, the department of public health and environment may consider: (I) Whether the activities disclosed may create imminent and substantial endang erment of, or result in serious harm to, public health and the environment; and (II) Whether the activities disclosed conferred an unfair or excessive economic benefit on the disclosing entity . (b) Notwithstanding any provision of sections 25-1-114.5 (4) and (5), 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., the department of public health and environment has discretion to determine whether and to what degree the factors in parag raph (a) of this subsection (3) apply given the particular circumstances of each situation. Page 24 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(4) The pilot project created by this section applies to voluntary disclosures made under this section and sections 25-1-114.5, 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1)(j), C.R.S., on and after the effective dates of both this section (May 30, 2000) and the memorandum of agreement entered into under parag raph (c) of subsection (1) of this section. (5) Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 13-25-126.5, C.R.S., the department of public health and environment may obtain access to an environmen tal self-audit report where the department of public health and environment has independent evidence of any criminal violation of an environmental law. Evidence of a criminal violation constitutes \"compelling circumstances\" for purposes of section 13-25-126.5 (3)(c), C.R.S., where the department of public health and environment seeks access to an environmental self-audit report. When a self- audit report is obtained, reviewed, or used in a criminal proceeding under this subsection (5), the privile ge provided in section 13-25-126.5, C.R.S., applicable to civil or administrative proceeding s is not waived or eliminated.

(1) The department shall require all skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities to adopt and make public a statement of the rights and responsibilities of the patients who are receiving treatment in such facilities and to treat their patients in accordance with the provisions of said statement. The statement shall ensure each patient the following : (a) The right to civil and religious liberties, including knowledg e of available choices and the right to independent personal decisions, which will not be infring ed upon, and the right to encouragement and assistance from the staff of the facility in the fullest possible exercise of these rig hts; (b) The right to have private and unrestricted communications with any person of his choice; (c) The right to present grievances on behalf of himself or others to the facility 's staff or administrator, to governmental officials, or to any other person, without fear of reprisal, and to join with other patients or individuals within or outside of the facility to work for improvements in patient care; (d) The right to manag e his own financial affairs or to have a quarterly accounting of any financial transactions made in his behalf, should he deleg ate such responsibility to the facili ty for any period of time; (e) The right to be fully informed, in writing , prior to or at the time of admissi on and during his stay, of services available in the facility and of related charg es, including charge s for services not covered under medicare or medicaid or not covered by the basic per diem rate; (f) The right to be adequately informed of his medical condition and proposed treatment, unless otherwise indicated by his physician, and to participate in the planning of all medical Page 26 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printouttreatment, including the right to refuse medic ation and treatment, unless otherwise indicated by his phy sician, and to know the consequences of such actions; (g) The right to receive adequate and appropriate health care consistent with established and recognized practice standards within the community and with skilled and intermediate nursing care facility rules and reg ulations as promulg ated by the department; (h) The right to have privacy in treatment and in caring for personal needs, confidentiality in the treatment of personal and medical records, and security in storing and using personal possessions; (i) The right to be treated courteously , fairly , and with the fullest meas ure of dignity and to receive a written statemen t of the services provided by the facility , including those required to be offered on an as-needed basis; (j) The right to be free from menta l and physical abuse and from physical and chemical restraints, except those restraints initiated throug h the judgment of the professional staff for a specified and limited period of time or on the written authoriz ation of a phy sician; (k) The right to be transferred or discharg ed only for medical reasons or his welfare, or that of other patients, or for nonpay ment for his stay and the right to be given reasonable advance notice of any transfer or discharg e, except in the case of an emerg ency as determined by the professional staff; (l) The right to devolution of his or her rights and responsibilities upon a sponsor, guardian, or person exercising rights contained in a desig nated beneficiary agreement executed pursuant to article 22 of title 15, C.R.S., who shall see that he or she is provided with adequate, appropriate, and respectful medical treatment and care and all rights which he or she is capable of exercising should he or she be determined to be incompetent pursuant to law and not be restored to leg al capacity ; (m) The rig ht to freedom of choice in selecting a health care facility ; (n) The right to copies of the facility 's rules and regulations and an explanation of his responsibility to obey all reasonable rules and regulations of the facility and to respect the personal rig hts and private property of the other patients. (1.5) If a facility requires a lease agreement with a provision requiring in excess of a month-to-month tenancy and the lease agreement results in or requires forfeiture of more than thirty days of rent if a patient moves due to a medical condition or dies during the term of the lease agreemen t, then the lease agreement shall be deemed to be against public policy and shall be void; except that inclus ion of such a provision shall not render the remainder of the contract or lease agreement void. A contract provision or lease agreement that requires forfeiture of rent for thirty days after the patient moves due to a medical condition or dies does not violate this section. The provisions regarding forfeiture of rent shall appear on the front page of the contract or lease agreement and shall be printed in no less than twelve-point bold-faced type. The provisions shall read as follows: This lease agreeme nt is for a month-to-m onth tenancy.

The genera l assembly hereby finds that the operation of child care centers in nursing home facilities is desirable because the benefit to nursing home facility employ ees in having on-location child care will impro ve the quality of care in nursing home facilities by stabiliz ing the nursing home work force and because the general public, especially in rural areas, will benefit from the increased availability of day care centers in their communities. The general assembly also finds that the operation of child care centers in nursing home facilities is desirable because the intergenerational contact has been proven to be beneficial to the health and well-being of elderly persons and, therefore, will improve the quality of life of elderly residents in nursing home facilities and because the interg enerational contact will be beneficial to the children as well. The general assembly , therefore, declares that the intent of this part 10 is to encourage the development of child care centers in nursing home facilities by encourag ing the creation of private grants to provide funds to start such centers and by requiring the state agencies which licen se nursing home facilities and child care centers to study and recommend statutory and regulatory chang es to facilitate and encourag e the development of child care centers in nursing home facilities.

The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that maintaining the confidentiality of medical records is of the utmost importance to the state and of critical importance to patient privacy for high quality medical care. Most people in the United States consider confidential ity of health information important and worry that the increased computeri zation of health records may result in inappropriate disclosure of such records. Patients have a strong interest in preserving the privacy of their personal health information, but they also have an interest in medical research and other efforts by health care organizations to improve the medical care they receive. How best to preserve confidentiality within a state health information infrastructure is an important discussion that is affected by recent regulations promulg ated by the federal department of health and human services related to the electronic storag e of health information. The purpose of this part 12 is to index the provisions that govern medical record confidentiality to facilitate locating the law concerning the confidentiality of medical records and health information. It is not intended to expand, narrow, or clarify existing provisions. Source: L. 2001: Entire part added, p. 828, \u00a7 5, effective Aug ust 8. 25-1-1202.

(1) (a) In the licensing of an ambulatory surgical center following the issuance of initial licensure by the department of public health and environment, the voluntary submission of satisfactory evidence that the applicant is accred ited by the joint commission, the American association for accreditation of ambulatory surgery facilities, inc., the accreditation association for ambulatory health care, the American osteopathic association, or any successor entities shall be deemed to meet certain requirements for license renewal so long as the standards for accreditation applied by the accrediting organization are at least as string ent as the licensure requirements otherwise specified by the department. (b) (I) In the applic ation for the renewal of a license for a health facility described in section 25-3-101, other than an ambulatory surgical center, the department of public health and environment shall deem health facilities that are currently accredited by an accrediti ng organization recog nized by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services as satisfy ing the requirements for renewal of the license. (II) If the standards for national accreditation are less stringent than the state' s licensure standards for a particular health facility , the department of public health and environment may Page 178 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutconduct a survey that focuses on the more string ent state standards. Beginning one year after the department first grants deemed status to a health facility pursuant to this parag raph (b), the department may conduct validation survey s, based on a valid sample methodolog y, of up to ten percent of the total number of accredit ed health facilities in the industry , excluding hospitals.

(III) If the department of public health and environment takes an enforcement activity , as define d in section 25-1.5-103 (2)(b.5), against a health facility to which it has granted deemed status pursuant to this parag raph (b), the department may revoke the health facility 's deemed status. (c) Upon submission of a completed application for license renew al, the department of public health and environment shall accept proof of the accredit ation in lieu of licensing inspe ctions or other requirements. Nothing in this section exempts an accredited health facility from inspections or from other forms of oversig ht by the department as necessary to ensure public health and safety . (2) In determining fees otherwise payable by a health facility for license renewal, the department of public health and environment shall give due consideration to efficiencies and savings generated in connection with the deemed status process in subsection (1) of this section and shall specifically provide an appropriate credit or reduced fee to a health facility that achieves license renewal throug h deemed status.

(b) \"Sexual assault survivor\" shall have the same meaning as \"victim\" as defined in section 18-3-401 (7), C.R.S. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contr ary, all health care facilities that are licensed pursuant to this part 1 and provide emerg ency care to sexual assault survivors shall amend their evidence-collection protocols for the treatment of sexual assault survivors to include informing the survivor in a timely manner of the availability of emerg ency contraception as a means of pregnancy prophy laxis and educating the survivor on the proper use of emerg ency contraception and the appropriate follow-up care.

(5) The general assembly encourag es health care facilities to provide training to emerg ency room staff concerning the efficacy of emerg ency contraception and the time-sensitive nature of (6) Because emerg ency contraception is time-sensitive and a sexual assault survivor may seek information on or direct access to emerg ency contraception to prevent an unintended pregnancy resulting from the assault instead of or prior to seeking hospital treatment, it is critical that sexual assault survivors have accurate information about the availability and use of emerg ency contraception. Therefore, the g eneral assembly encourag es: (a) Entities offering victim assistance or counseling and rape crisis hotlines to include information concerning the availability and use of emerg ency contraception; and (b) Licensed or registered pharmacies in the state of Colorado to distribute information concerning the availability and use of emerg ency contraception.

(1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that trauma is the greatest single cause of death and disability in Colorado for persons under the age of forty -five years and that trauma care is a unique type of emerg ency medical service. (2) The general assembly further finds that a trauma system task force made up of various emerg ency health and traum a care entities submitted a report to the general assembly in 1993 indicating a compelling need to develop and implement a statewide trauma care system in order to assure that appropriate resources are available to trauma victims from the point of injury throug h rehabilitative care. In addition, a statewide system is essential to provide Colorado residents and visitors with a greater probability of surviving a life-threatening injury and to reduce trauma-related morbidity and mortality in this state. (3) The general assembly , therefore, declares that it is necessary to enact legislation directing the board of health to adopt rules that govern the implementation and oversig ht of the trauma care system. The general assembly further declares that to ensure the avail ability and coordination of resources necessary to provide essential care, it is necessary to enact legislation that directs the depart ment of public health and environment to collaborate with existing agencies and organizations, including governing bodies for count ies and cities and counties, in implementing and monitoring a statewide trauma care sy stem.

(1) The g eneral assembly hereby finds that: (a) The use of all types of tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco, results in a high incidence of addiction, disease, illness, and death; (b) Persons who begin using and become addicted to tobacco products in their youth often face a lifetime of strug gle and recurring illness in coping with and attempting to overcome addiction to tobacco products; (c) Experimentation with tobacco products by youth is often a first step toward more serious drug experimentation and creates a greater likelihood that the youth who experiment with tobacco will at some point be addicted to even more harmful substances; (d) Implementation of aggressive tobacco and substan ce abuse prevention, education, and cessation programs for school-ag e children is necessary to assist young people in avoiding and ending tobacco use; (e) School districts, schools, and other entities that provide tobacco and substance abuse prevention, education, and cessation programs for school-ag e children should reach out to parents and encourag e them to participate, either as students or role models, in implementing said prog rams. (2) The genera l assembly finds that persons with behavioral or mental health disorders are more likely to abuse tobacco products than any other segment of socie ty. The general assembly further finds that the unusually heavy pattern of tobacco abuse engaged in by persons with behavioral or mental health disorders requires special treatment strateg ies that are not provided by other alcohol, drug, or tobacco abuse programs or substance use disorder treatment programs. It is therefore the general assembly 's intent that the programs funded pursuant to this part 8 include comprehensive programs to prevent and treat tobacco addiction among persons with behavioral or mental health disorders. (3) The g eneral assembly also finds that: (a) Each year, thousan ds of people in this state die from diseases that have been clinically proven to be caused by or directly related to tobacco use; (b) Once a person starts using tobacco, he or she usually becomes addicted to the nicotine contained in the tobacco, which makes it terribly difficult for the person to quit using Page 262 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printouttobacc o even when the person is aware of the significant health risks that accompany tobacco use; (c) Studies show that a child is at a substantially greater risk of starting to use tobacco if the child's parents or older sibling s use tobacco. Therefore, reducing tobacco use by adults may significantly reduce the risk that children will beg in using tobacco. (d) Annual direct medical costs from tobacco use in Colorado currently exceed one billion dollars; (e) Comprehensive tobacco educatio n, prevention, and cessation programs may result in millions of dollars in saving s to the state and individual residents of the state for g enerations.

Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) Recent newborn screening innovations are considered among the greatest public health achievements of the twenty -first century ; (b) Scientific research has demonstrated that newborn screening not only saves lives and improves developmental outcomes but also contributes to cost saving s for families, health care systems, and the state; (c) Newborn screening includes conditions for which diagnosis and treatment must be implemented in a timely manner in order to achieve max imum benefit for the child; Page 327 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(d) Newborn screening is an appro priate public health function to provide necessary educational services to healt h care providers, families, and communities so that appropriate resources and information are available; (e) Newborn screening is a public health function that identifies newborns at risk of certain conditions or hearing loss, as well as newborns who do not receive screening , and appropriately connects them to care; (f) An effective newborn screening program is dependent upon a strong system of education and coordination among primary care provide rs, hospitals, specialty care providers, patient and family support organizations, public health laboratory staff, and public health professionals; (g) State policy regarding newborn screening and genetic counseli ng and education should be made with full public knowledg e, in light of expert opinion, and should be constantly reviewed to consider chang ing medical knowledg e and ensure full public protection; (h) Participation of persons in newborn screening programs or genetic counseling programs in this state should be wholly voluntary , and all information obtained from persons involved in these programs in the state must be held strictly confidential. Family participation in the follow-up support and assistance services is voluntary . (i) Hear ing loss occurs in newborn infants more frequently than any other health condition for which newborn infant screening is required; (j) Eighty percent of the language ability of a child is established by the time the child is eighteen months of age, and it is vitally important to support the healthy development of language skills; (k) Early detection, early intervention, and treatment of hearing loss in a child are highly effective in facilitating a child' s healthy development in a manner consistent with the child' s age and cog nitive ability ; (l) Children with hearing loss who do not receive early intervention and treatment frequently require special educational services, which, for the vast majority of children in the state with hearing needs, are publicly funded; and (m) Appr opriate testing and identification of newborn infants with hearing loss will facilitate early intervention and treatment and will therefore serve the public purposes of promoting the healthy devel opment of children and reducing the need for additional public expenditures.

PART 24 IMMUNI ZATION REGI STRY ACT Page 393 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout25-4-2401. Short title. This part 24 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Immuniz ation Reg istry Act\" \u00a7 6, effective April 26. 25-4-2402. Legislati ve declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) Immuniz ation is one of the most important ways to protect individu als and communities against serious infectious diseases and their conseq uences, and widespread immuniz ation has virtually eliminated many serious diseases that were once responsible for millions of infections and thousands of deaths each y ear. (b) Althoug h immuniz ation rates of infants, children, adolescents, and adults in Colorado have improved over the last several years, there is a need to continue to improve the rates so that fewer individuals are put at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases. (c) Timely vaccination of children, adolescents, and adults not only protects them against common, sometimes serious, and potentially fatal diseases, but also serves the community as one of the most successful and cost-effective public health tools available for the prevention and spread of these infections, and the vaccines are safe and highly protective, particularly when administered according to recommended schedules. (d) More than twenty percent of preschool-aged children in Colorado are not fully vaccinated and are at increased risk of contracting and spreading vaccine-preventable diseases. (e) It is unnecessary for children, adolescents, and adults to be subjected to suffering or death from diseases that are immuniz ation preventable. (f) In 2005, hospital charg es for the care of children with vaccine-preventable diseases exceeded twenty -five million dollars. Additionally , tens of millions of dollars were spent on the costs of the outpatient care of affected children, in addition to the costs of the loss of productivity and absences from work for careg ivers due to the absences of children from school. (g) Over the past three decades, the recommended vaccination schedules for children and adults have become increasing ly more complex as vaccines have been combined, new vaccines have been added, and the delivery system has incorporated more manufa cturers, distributors, and providers. Additionally , local and national vaccine shortag es and distribution errors have resulted in compromised vaccination initiatives. (h) For Colorado to be consistent with the healthy people 2010 initiative and reach the goal of immuniz ing ninety percent of all children in the state in a timely and expeditious manner, the Colorado immuniz ation information system must be funded and sustain ed. The Colorado immuniz ation information system may also provide a secure method for authoriz ed individuals and entities to access information collected by public ag encies. (2) Therefore, the general assembly supports the expansion of the Colorad o immuniz ation reg istry and supports increased access to immuniz ations for persons in Colorado.

(1) (a) The general assembly hereby declares that this part 11 is enacted for the purpose of reducing exposure of children to lead hazards and reducing the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in children under seven years of age. The general assembly finds and determines that: (I) Exposure of children to lead represents a significant environmental health problem in the state that is preventable; (II) The existence of elevated blood lead levels in children is of great concern to the citizens of Colorado because lead poisoning in children may necessitate large expenditures of public funds for health care and special education, which expenditures could be avoided if exposure of children to lead is reduced; (III) A comprehensive lead hazard reduction program is needed to prevent elevated blood lead levels in children and, if implemented , such program could prevent hundreds of Colorado' s children, many of whom currently go undiag nosed or untreated, from being exposed to lead at levels believed to be harmful. (b) Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly to establish and fund a statewide lead hazard prevention, intervention, and reduction program within the department of public health and environment for the purposes of: (I) Compiling information concerning the prevalence, causes, and geographic occurrence of elevated levels of lead in children' s blood; (II) Identifying areas of the state where children' s lead ex posures are sig nificant; (III) Analy zing lead information and, where indicated, desig ning and implementing a program of medical monitoring and follow-up and environmental intervention that will reduce the incidence of excessive exposure of children to lead in residences and child-occupied facilities in Colorado; and (IV) Providing comprehensive educational materials that are targeted to health care providers, child care providers, schools, parents of young children, the real estate industry , and owners of rental properties.

(1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) The American academy of pediatrics recommends breast-feeding exclusively for the first six months of an infant' s life but continuing with other forms of nutrition for at least the first twelve months of an infant' s life and as long thereafter as is mutually desired. (b) The American academy of pediatrics has continuously endorsed breast-feeding as the optimal form of nutrition for infants and as a foundation for good feeding practices. Extensive research indicates that there are diverse and compelling advantag es to breast-feeding for infants, mothers, families, and society . (c) Epidemiolog ic research shows that breast-feeding of infants provides benefits to their general health, growth, and developmen t and results in significant decreases in risk for numerous acute and chronic diseases. (d) Research in developed countries provides strong evidence that breast-feeding decreases the incidence and severity of diarrhea, lower respiratory infection, otitis media, and urinary tract infection. (e) Research studies have also shown that huma n milk and breast-feeding have possible protective effects against the development of a number of chronic diseases, including allerg ic Page 485 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutdiseas es and some chronic digestive diseases. In addition, human milk and breast-feeding may prevent obesity . (f) In addition, breast-feeding has been related to the possible enhancement of cogn itive development. (g) Breast-feeding has been shown to have numerous health benefits for mothers, including an earlier return to prepreg nant weight, delayed resumption of ovulation with increased child spacing , improved bone remineral ization postpartum with reduction in hip fractures in the postmenopausal period, and reduced risk of ovarian cancer and premenopausal breast cancer, as well as increased levels of oxytocin, resulting in less postpa rtum bleeding and more rapid uterine involution. (h) In addition to individual health benefits, breast-feeding results in substantial benefits to society , including reduced health care costs, reduced environmental damag e, reduced governmental spending on the women, infants, and children supplementary feeding programs, and reduced employ ee absenteeism for care attributable to infant illness. (i) Breast-feeding is a basic and important act of nurturing that should be encourag ed in the interests of maternal and infant health. (2) The general assembly furthe r declares that the purpose of this part 3 is for the state of Colorado to become involved in the national movement to recog nize the medical importance of breast-feeding , within the scope of complete pediatric care, and to encourag e removal of societal boundaries placed on breast-feeding in public.

In order to foster the health, welfare, convenience, and comfort of the inhabitants of the state of Colorado and to facilitate the enjoy ment and use of the scenic and natural resources of the state, it is declared to be the policy of this state to achieve the maximum practical degree of air purity in every portion of the state, to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards, and to prevent the significant deterioration of air quality in those portions of the state where the air quality is bette r than the national ambient air quality standards. To that end, it is the purpose of this article to require the use of all available practical methods which are technolog ically feasible and economically reasonable so as to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution throug hout the state of Colorado; to require the development of an air quality control program in which the benefits of the air pollution control measures utiliz ed bear a reasonable relationship to the economic, environmenta l, and energ y impacts and other costs of such measures; and to maintain a cooperative program between the state and local units of government. It is further declared that the prevention, abatement, and control of air pollution in each portion of the state are matte rs of statewide concern and are affected with a public interest and that the provisions of this article are enacted in the exercise of the police powers of this state for the purpose of protecting the health, peace, safety , and general welfare of the people of this state. The general assembly further recognizes that a current and accurate inventory of actual emissions of air polluta nts from all sources is essential for the proper identification and designation of attainment and nonattainm ent areas, the determination of the most cost-effective regulatory strateg y to reduce pollution, the targeting of regulatory efforts to achieve the greatest health and environmental benefits, and the achievement of a federally approved clean air program. In order to achieve the most accurate inventory of air pollution sources possible, this article specifically provides incentives to achieve the most accurate and complete inventory possible and to provide for the most accurate enforcemen t program achievable based upon that inventory .

The program developed by the commission under this subsecti on (7) shall include, but not be limited to, the imposition of any fees necessary to administer the program, including the recovery of costs by the state for the evaluation of planning documents pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, and the imposition of penalties pursuant to section 25-7-122. (b) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the Grand Cany on visibility transport commission' s recommen dations for improving western vistas report identified the emissions from fire, both wildfire and prescribed fires, as likely to have the single greatest impact on visibility at class I areas throug h the year 2040. The emissions from fire, both wildfire and prescribed fire, are an important episodic contributor to visibility impairing aerosols. The Gran d Canyon visibility transport commission report identified that significant amounts of visibility impairment result from activities on federal lands, from mobile sources, and from Mexico. (c) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declare s that emissions from grassland and forest fires have substantial episodic impacts on ambient air quality throug hout the state and are a major source of visibility impairment over which this state has jurisdiction but has not y et developed a comprehensive prog ram to reduce such impairment. (d) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that the standard in its statement of legislative purpose in section 25-7-102 of the \"Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act\" requiring the use of all practical methods that are technolog ically feasible and economically reasonable so as to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution is an appropr iate standard to apply in relation to air pollution emissions resulting from the use of prescribed fire in grassland and forest manag ement. (e) This subsection (7) and subsection (8) of this section are adopted pursuant to section 118 of the federal act and shall be construed to exercise the full extent of the state' s authority as granted by the provisions of said federal act. The federal government, as the only landowner of its size in the state and the only landowner in the state other than the state government itself that routinely prepares plans involving the manag ement of grassland and forest lands using prescribed fire, is appropriately subject to the requirements of this section pertaining to review and approval of planning documents. Page 504 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(f) Persons owning or manag ing large parcels of land who significantly use prescribed fire as a grassland or forest manag ement tool shall prepare plans addressing the use and role of prescribed fire and the air quality impacts resulting therefrom, and such plans are appropriately subject to the review requirements of this section. The state, by reviewing these types of plans, can achieve significant progress towards cooperatively reducing emissions from those lands that impact visibility in Colorado. (g) As used in this subsection (7) and in subsection (8) of this section, the term \"significant user of prescribed fire\" means a federal, state, or local agency or significant manag ement unit thereof or person that collectively manages or owns more than ten thousand acres of grasslands or forest lands within the state of Colorado and that uses prescribed fire. The adoption of a fire manag ement plan by a local or county unit of government pursuant to section 30-11-124, C.R.S., does not constitute manag ement for purposes of this section unless the county or local unit of government owns or manag es more than ten thousand acres and is a significant user of prescribed fire. \"Prescribed fire\" means fire that is intentional ly used for grassland or forest manag ement, regardless of whether the fire is caused by natural or human sources. Prescribed fire does not include open burning in the course of agricultura l operations and does not include open burning for the purpose of maintaining water convey ance structures, unless the commissio n acts pursuant to section 25-7-123. The commission shall by rule exempt from the program developed pursuant to this subsection (7) those sources that have an insig nificant impact on visibility and air quality . (8) (a) The commission, in exercising the powers conferred by subsection (7) of this section and this subsection (8), shall require all significant users of prescribed fire, including federal agencies for activities directly conducted by or on behalf of federal agencies on federal lands, to minimiz e emissions using all available, practicable methods that are techno logically feasible and economica lly reasonable in order to minimiz e the impact or reduce the potential for such impact on both the attainment and maintenance of national ambient air quality standards and the achievement of federal and state visibility goals. (b) (I) In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection (8), significant users of prescribed fire shall submit planning documents to the commission. The commission shall then conduct a public hearing to revie w each planning document submitted relevant to achieving the goal of minimiz ing emissions and impacts as set forth in paragr aph (a) of this subsection (8). Only one hearing shall be held for each planning document. The commission shall hold a hearing and complete its review of the planning documents submitted by any significant user of prescribed fire within forty-five days of their receipt by the commission, unless otherwise ag reed to by the sig nificant user of prescribed fire. (II) As used in this paragraph (b), \"planning documents\" means documents that summariz e the use of prescribed fire as a grassland or forest management tool and the associated discharg e or release of air pollution and that demonstrate how compliance with the state standard expressed in section 25-7-102 shall be achieved. \"Planning documents\" shall include land manag ement plans or a summary of the equivalent information that explains and supports the land manag ement criteria evaluated and the decision to use prescribed fire as the fuel treatment method. Planning documents shall include a discussion of the alternat ives considered and a discussion of how prescribed fire, if selected, minimiz es the risk of wildfire. (III) The commission shall have discretion to adopt rules governing the resubm ission of planning documents to prevent such plans from becoming outdated. Page 505 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(c) Following a public hearing , the commission shall comment and make recommendations to the significant user of prescribed fire regarding any chang es to elements of the plan relating to the discharg e or release of air pollutants that the commission finds necessary to comply with the state standard ex pressed in section 25-7-102.

(1) The commission shall promulg ate, no later than March 1, 1990, such combination of regulations as it may find to be cost-effective and consistent with the legislative declaratio n set forth in section 25-7-102 in order to establish limitations on the use of wood-burning stoves and firepl aces during those periods of time declared by the Colorado department of health to be a high pollution day. The departm ent may declare a high pollution day based on experienced or anticipated excessive levels of carbon monox ide or particulates when air pollution standards are exceeded for particulat es, carbon monox ide, or visibility . The limitations on the use of wood- burning stoves and fireplaces imposed pursuant to this section may include no-burn days, and such no-burn days shall be specific to the separate airsheds within the Denver-B oulder metropolitan area. Such limitations shall be applicable only in those portions of the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson which are located in the AIR program area, as such area is defined in section 42-4-304 (20), C.R.S. Such regulations shall exclude areas above seven thousand feet unless the commission determines that particulates from wood burning in such areas are contributing to the brown cloud. Such regulations shall not apply to any person who utiliz es wood-burning stoves or fireplaces as the primary source of heat in such person' s place of residence. Such regulations shall permit exemptions for wood-burning stoves that meet Phase III emissions standards. For the purposes of this section, \"Phase III\" means wood stove standards adopted by the commission which are more strict than existing wood stove standards. The regulations promulg ated pursuant to this subsection (1) shall not be effective until J uly 1, 1990. (2) No regulation promulg ated by the commission pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall apply within any municipality which has in effect on January 1, 1990, an ordinance Page 506 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutmandating restricted use of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces during those periods of time declared by the Colorado department of health to be hig h pollution day s.

(1) The commission shall, within one hundred eighty days after June 20, 1979, and thereafter from time to time, if evidence indicates a need, review the current classification of any attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable area within the state and shall revise the classification of any such area or part thereof which is calculated by air quality modeling or shown by monitored data or other reliable methods to be invalid. (2) The commission shall, upon application by the owner or operator of any existing or proposed stationary source, review the desig nation of any attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable area within the state and shall revise the desig nation of any such area or part thereof which is calculated by air quality modeling or shown by monitored data or other reliable methods to be invalid. (2.5) Whenever monitoring data for any pollutant for which an area is desig nated nonattainment demonstrate that the national ambient air quality standard for that pollutant has been attained in accordance with the criteria required under the federal act, the division and commission shall take ex peditious action to redesig nate the area as attainment for that pollutant. (3) In making any determination regarding the attainment, nonattai nment, or unclassifiable desig nation of any area within the state with regard to particulate matter, the commission shall consider and, if consistent with the requirements of Part D of the federal act, discount the effects of particulate matter not of a size or substance to adversely affect public health or welfare.

(1) (a) Except as provided in sections 25-7-130 and 25-7-131, as promptly as possible, the commission shall adopt, promulgate, and from time to time modify or repeal emission control regulations which require the use of effective practical air pollution controls: (I) For each sig nificant source or categ ory of sig nificant sources of air pollutants; (II) For each type of facility, process, or activity which produces or might produce significant emissions of air pollutants. (b) The requirements and prohibitions contained in such regulations shall be set forth with as much specificity and clarity as is practical. Upon adoption of an emission control regulation under subparag raph (II) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (1) for the control of a specific facility , process, or activity , such regulation shall apply to the exclusion of other emission control regulations adopted pursuant to subparag raph (I) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (1); prior to such adoption, the general regulations adopted pursuant to subparag raph (I) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (1) shall be applicable to such facility , process, or activity . In the formulation of each emission control regulation, the commission shall take into consideration the following : (I) The state policy regarding air pollution, as set forth in section 25-7-102; (II) Federal recommendations and requirements; (III) The degree to which altitude, topography, climate, or meteorolog y in certain portions of the state require that emission control regulations be more or less string ent than in other portions of the state; (IV) The degree to which any particular type of emission is subject to treatment, and the availability , technical feasibility , and economic reasonableness of control techniques; (V) The ex tent to which the emission to be controlled is sig nificant; (VI) The continuous, intermittent, or seasonal nature of the emission to be controlled; (VII) The economic, environmental , and energy costs of compliance with such emission control reg ulation; Page 509 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(VIII) Whether an emission control regulation should be applied throug hout the entire state or only within specified areas or zones of the state, and whether it should be applied only when a specified class or ty pe of pollution is concerned. (2) Such emission control regulations may include, but shall not be limited to, regulations pertaining to: (a) Visible pollutants; (b) Particulates; (c) Sulfur fluorides, and any other chemical substance; (d) Odors, except for livestock feeding operations that are not housed commercial swine feeding operations as defined in section 25-8-501.1 (2)(b); (e) Open burning activity ; (f) Org anic solvents; (g) Photochemical substances; (h) Haz ardous air pollutants. (3) Emission control regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall include, but shall not be limited to, reg ulations pertaining to the following facilities, processes, and activities: (a) I ncinerator and incinerator desig n; (b) Stora ge and transfer of petroleum products and any other volatile organic compounds; (c) Activities which frequently result in particulate matter becoming airborne, such as construction and demolition operations; (d) Specifications, prohibitions, and requirements pertaining to fuels and fuel additives, such as tetraethy l lead; (e) Wigwam waste burners, pulp mills, alfalfa dehydrators, asphalt plants, and any other industrial or commercial activity which tends to emit air pollutants as a by -product; (f) Industrial process equipment; (g) Industrial spray ing operations; (h) Airplanes; (i) Diesel-powered machines, vehicles, eng ines, and equipment; (j) Storag e and transfer of volatile compounds and hazardous or toxic gases or other hazardous substances which may become airborne. (4) The commission shall promulg ate appropria te regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants. (5) The commission shall promulg ate appropriate regulations setting conditions and time limitations for periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction or other conditions which justif y temporary relief from controls. Operations of any air pollution source during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance or compliance test. (6) The commission shall establish test methods and procedures for determining compliance with emission control regulations promulg ated under this section and, in so doing , shall, to the maximum degree consistent with the purposes of this article, consider the test methods and procedures established by the United States environmental protection agency and shall adopt such test methods and procedures as shall minimiz e the possibility of inconsistency or duplication of effort. Page 510 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(7) All regulations promulg ated pursuant to this section shall conform with the provisions of part 5 of this article concerning asbestos control. (8) (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall not regulate emissions from agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural production such as farming, season al crop drying, animal feeding operations that are not housed commercial swine feeding operations as defined in section 25-8-501.1 (2)(b), and pesticide application; except that the commission shall regulate such emissions if they are \"major stationary sources\" , as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. sec. 7602 (j), or are required by Part C (prevention of significant deterioration), Part D (nonattainment), or Title V (minimum elements of a permit program), or are participating in the early reduction program of section 112 of the federal act, or is not required by section 111 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to be excluded as a major source under this article. (b) Nothing in parag raph (a) of this subsection (8), as amended by House Bill 05-1180, as enacted at the first regular session of the sixty-fifth general assembly , shall be construed as chang ing the property tax classification of property owned by a horticultural or floricultural operation. (9) (a) The commission shall adopt a procedure consistent with the federal environmental protection agency requirements for determining when there has been a net significant emissions increase which results in a major modification that subjects a source to the permitting requirements of the prevention of significant deterioration program or the nonatt ainment area new source review. The commission' s procedure shall also prohibit sources from circumventing the new source review requirements in a manner consistent with the federal environmental protection agency guidance. Such procedure shall be the same for both the prevention of significant deterioration program and the nonattainment area new source review program and shall not apply to hazardous air pollutants. Such net emissions increase procedure shall be as described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9), unless and until the federal environmental protect ion agency requires otherwise or unless after January 1, 1998, the commission: (I) Undertakes a collaborative process with the affected industries to determine the cost and emission impacts associated with any proposed chang es in this procedure; (II) Reviews at least three years of emission s increases and decreases under the procedures described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9); (III) Delivers reports on the matters required in subparag raphs (I) and (II) of this parag raph (a) to the g eneral assembly for its review; (IV) Determines throug h rule-making that an applicabili ty procedure for major modifications more string ent than that described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9) is equitable when considering minor, area, and mobile source controls; and (V) Determines throug h rule-making that such more string ent applica bility procedure is necessary to attain and to maintain the national ambient air quality standards. (b) The procedure for determining when there has been a net significant emissions increase shall be consistent with requirements of the federal environmental protection agency and: (I) Such requirements shall apply only if there is, in the first instan ce, a significant emissions increase from an individual proposed project or modification. If the individual proposed project or modification will not result in a significant emissions increase, it shall be Page 511 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutexempt from the prevention of significant deterioration program and the nonattainment area new source review requirements. (II) If a project or modification is not exempt under subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (b), each pollutant for which the project results in a significant emissions increase shall be subjec t to the prevention of significant deterioration program or the nonattainment area new source review requirements only if the sum of all source-wide, non-de minim is, contemporaneous, and creditable emissions increases and decreases of that pollutant or that regulated precursor exceed applicable significance levels. Each specific regulated precursor shall be considered independently in determining applicable sig nificance levels. (III) In determining the non-de minimis net emissions increase during the contemporaneous period, the commission' s procedures shall be consist ent with the federal environmental protect ion agency's review procedure for determining net emissions increases and decreases. Non-de minimis increases shall exclude all increases which would be exempt under commission rules from a requirement to obtain a construction permit under section 25-7-114.2.

Colorado hazardous air pollutant control and reduction program - rules. (1) The commission shall promulg ate appropriate regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants as defined in section 25-7-103 (13) which are consistent with this section and the requirements of and emission standards promulg ated pursuant to section 112 of the federal act, including any standard required to be imposed under section 112(r) of the federal act. The commission shall monitor the progress and results of the risk studies performed under section 112 of the federal act to show that Colorado' s hazardous air pollutant control and reduction program is consistent with the national strateg y. (2) The commission may only promulg ate regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants as defined in section 25-7-103 (13) in accordance with this section. In order to minimiz e additional regulatory and compliance costs to the state' s economy , any program created by the commission pursuant to this section shall contain a provision which exempts those sources or categ ories of sources which it determines to be of minor significance from the requirements of the program. Consistent with the provisions of section 25-7-105.1, the commission shall authoriz e synthetic minor sources of hazardous air pollutants by the issuance of construction permits or prohibitory rules or other regulations. Such permits, rules, or regulations shall only be as string ent as necessary to establish synthetic minor status. The commission shall expeditiously implement this subsection (2) to assure that all sources may be able to timely qualify as a synthetic minor source, thereby avoiding the costs of the operating permit prog ram. (3) (a) (I) As soon as adequate scienti fic, technolog ical, and hazardous air pollutant emissions information is available, the commission may promulga te regulations for the control of hazardous air pollutants utilizing Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT technolog y-based emission reduction requirements, as defined in section 25-7-103 (6.7) and (6.8). (II) The division may establish schedules of compliance of up to five years leading to final compliance for any such regulation, which shall be enforced throug h regulations or cond itions in construction permits issued pursuant to section 25-7-114.2 or 25-7-114.5. In determining any schedule of compliance, the division shall consi der the current availability of Page 514 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printouttechnolog y, costs of compliance, and the consequence of delay to the public health or environment or economy . (III) The division shall issue its determination of Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT and the compliance schedule in writing . (IV) Within thirty calendar days after receipt of a determination by the division requiring installation of Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT and the compliance schedule, pursuant to this subse ction (3), a source may appeal such a determination or compliance schedule by filing with the commission a written petition requesting a hearing to review the determination on a de novo basis. (V) Such hearing shall allow the parties to present evidence and argument on all issues and to conduct cross-examination required for full disclosure of the facts and shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-119. (b) This section shall only apply to sources emitting a hazardous air pollutant identified in the list established or amended pursuant to subsection (5) of this section which: (I) Are not included in categ ories or subcateg ories of sources listed or proposed to be listed by the environmental protection agency under section 112 of the federal act and thus will not be required to comply with GACT or MACT under the federal act, as defined in section 25- 7-103 (12.1) and (16.5); or (II) Are included in categ ories or subcateg ories of sources listed or proposed to be listed under section 112 of the federal act and which have: (A) Levels of emissions of hazardous air pollutants listed under section 112 (b) of the federal act which are below thresholds established under the federal act and thus will not be required to comply with GACT and MACT under the federal act and as defined in section 25-7- 103 (12.1) and (16.5); except that this section shall not apply to a source included in a categ ory or subcateg ory for which a lesser quantity emissio n rate has been proposed or adopted under section 112 of the federal act; or (B) Hazardous air pollutant emissions above a threshold level of the substance listed under subparag raph (I I) of parag raph (a) and parag raph (b) of subsection (5) of this section. (b.1) The commission may recog nize similarities among regulated sources or apply , when appropriate, previous control requirements established by the commission in making a determination about the need for such regulation under this subsection (3). The commission shall also consider fundamentally different factors between sources in making these determinations. (c) The commission shall desig nate by regulation those classes of minor or insignificant sources of emissions of hazardous air pollutants which are exempt from the requirements of this section because their emissions of hazardous air pollutants will result in an inconsequential risk to public health. (d) (I) A source subject to the requirements of this section may be exempt from installation of Colorado MACT or Colorado GACT or any Color ado health-based requirement if the division makes a determination that an alternative level of control, including no emission controls, will result in an inconsequential risk to public health. (II) The division shall issue its determina tion of a source' s request for exemption under this paragraph (d) in writing within sixty days of receipt of a complete application for an exemption and shall publish notice of its determinat ion by at least one publication in a newspaper of g eneral distribution in the area of the source requesting the ex emption. Page 515 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(III) Within thirty calendar days after receipt of a determin ation by the division of a request for exemption by a source under this parag raph (d), the source or any person may appeal such determination by filing with the commission a written petition requesting a hearing to review the ex emption request on a de novo basis. (IV) Such hearing shall allow the parties to present evidence and argument on all issues and to conduct cross-ex amination required for full disclosure of the facts and shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-119. (e) Any source as defined in section 112(i) of the federal act, and regulations promul gated thereunder, that participates in the early reduction program pursuant to section 112(i) of the federal act, or this article, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section for the same period of time exemptions from federal requirements or requi rements under this article are allowed under the early reduction prog ram. (f) This section shall not apply to sources subject to national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) established by the administrator pursuant to the federal act, but only for those emissions for which a NESHAP is established. (g) This section shall not impose requirements on sources included in categ ories or subcateg ories of sources which are listed in section 112(n) of the federal act which are inconsistent with the timing of studies or assessments conducted under or definitions set forth in section 112(n) of the federal act. (4) (a) (I) On or after the risk-based studies required under sections 112(k)(3), 112(o), and 112(f) of the federal act are completed and received by the commission, the comm ission may adopt regulations pertaining to those sources identified as emitting hazardous air pollutants regulated under this section which may include addit ional emission reduction requirements to address any residual risk of health effects with respect to actual persons living in the vicinity of sources after installation of technolog y-based controls. Imposit ion of such requirements may be made upon a determination by the commission that operation of sources without health-based controls does not or will not represent an inconsequential threat to public health. Regulations as finally adopted pursuant to this subsection (4) may apply on a source-specific basis. (II) Repealed. (b) Repealed. (c) Subject to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4), for existing sources not subject to regulation under section 25-7-114.3, or not subject to regulation as a modified source, the commission may promulg ate health-based regulations on a source-by -source basis, with the exceptions specified in parag raph (d) of this subsection (4). (d) The commission may recog nize similarities among regulated sources or apply , when appropriate, previous control requirements established by the commission pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4) in making a deter mination about the need for such regulation under this subsection (4). The commission shall also consider fundamentally different factors between sources in making these determinations. (e) The commission may establish schedules of compliance leading to final complianc e for any regulation promulg ated pursuant to this subsection (4). (f) A hearing conducted by the commission under this subsection (4) shall be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-110 or 25-7-119 or article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., as applicable. (g) In reaching a determination under this subsection (4), the commission shall give consideration to the technical availability of methods of compliance, the costs of compliance, Page 516 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutand the consequences of delay. The commission shall also consider cost-benefit analy sis and risk-benefit analy sis pursuant to section 24-4-103 (4.5), C.R.S. (h) Tem porary exceptional authority. (I) (A) This subparag raph (I) shall apply until such time as the commission is authoriz ed to act pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4). If the executive director of the department of public health and environment finds that a source in a category or subcateg ory of sources listed or proposed to be listed under section 112 of the federal act for which MACT or GACT is not scheduled for proposal until after 1997 and presents an unacceptable threat of actual health effects, then the executive director may direct the commission to evaluate and, as necessary , study such actual health effects. If the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that waiting until the source would be required to install GACT or MACT under section 112 of the federal act will cause an unacceptable incremental threat of actual health effects to persons living in the vicinity of such source, the comm ission may promulg ate regulations for the control of hazardous air pollutants for the source. The control regulations may include the least restricti ve control that will adequately protect the public, including but not limited to: Chemical substitution, pollution prevention, work process modifications, additional control technolog ies, or Colorado MACT or GAC T. In promulg ating Colorado GACT or MACT for the source, the commission shall consider and be as consistent as possible with GACT or MACT under section 112 of the federal act, minimiz ation of duplicative capital expenditures and minimiz ation of substantial reconstruction time. The commission shall provide a schedule of compliance leading to final compliance which considers matters identified in parag raphs (c), (e), (f), and (g ) of this subsection (4). (B) Any source which is required to install Colorado MACT or GACT under regulations promulg ated pursuant to sub-subparag raph (A) of this subparag raph (I) only and which subsequently is required to insta ll federal MACT or GACT that is significantly different than Colora do MACT or GACT and imposes a significant capital cost on the source, then the general assembly shall study and consider whether an operatin g permit fee credit or a state tax credit for the capital costs, or a percentag e of the costs, is appropriate. (II) Until such time as the commissio n is authoriz ed to act pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4) and upon the recommendation of the executive director of the department of public health and envir onment, the governor may find, as expressed in an executive order, that after an existing source has installed Colorado or federal MACT or GACT, or Colorado MACT or GACT has been proposed for a new source or a modification of an existing source, the source presents an unacceptable threat of actual health effects. The governor may then direct the commission to evaluate and, as necessary , conduct studies on actual health effects. If the commission determines by a preponderance of the evidence that emissions of hazardous air pollutants by the source will cause an unacceptable threat of actual health effects to persons living in the vicinity of such source, the commission may then promulg ate additional technolog y-based control regulations, pollution prevention, or health-based measures to protect the public health. The commission shall provide a schedul e of compliance leading to final compliance which considers matters identified in parag raphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this subsection (4). (III) This paragraph (h) shall remain effective only until such time as the commission acts pursuant to its authority under parag raph (a) of this subsection (4).

Page 528 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout25-7-110.8. Additional requirem ents for commission to act under section 25-7- 110.5. (1) In issuing any final rule intended to reduce air pollution, except for any rule that adopts by reference applicable federal rules, if the commission has no discretion under state law not to adopt the rules or to adopt any alternative rule, the commission shall make a determination that: (a) Any rule promulga ted under section 25-7-110.5 is based on reasonably available, validated, reviewed, and sound scientific methodolog ies and that all validated, reviewed, and sound scientific methodolog ies and information made available by interested parties has been considered. Such review may include internal org anizational review and not peer review. (b) Evid ence in the record supports the finding that the rule shall result in a demonstr able reduction in air pollution to be addressed by the rule unless such rule is administrative in nature; (c) On and after July 1, 1997, and in conformance with guidance from the general assembly to incorporate the recomm endations of the task force established in section 25-7-110.5 (6), evidence in the record supports the finding that the rule shall bring about reductions in risks to human health or the environment or provide other benefits that will justify the cost to government, the reg ulated community , and to the public to implement and comply with the rule; (d) The commission shall choose an alternati ve that is the most cost-effective under the analy sis required by section 25-7-110.5 (4), provides the regulated commun ity flexibility , and which achieves the necessary reduction in air pollution. The commission may reject the most cost-effective alternative and shall provide finding s of fact detailing why the most cost-effective alternative is unacceptable. (e) The selection of the regulatory alternative by the commission will maximize the air quality benefits of regulation pursuant to this article in the most cost-effective manner. For purposes of the requir ed analyses under this section, prior to the completion of the rule-making required pursuant to section 25-7-110.5, no benefit (except for air pollution reductions) can be attributed to regulating a facility already operating in compliance with a permit issued pursuant to applicable law. (1.5) As used in this section, \" rule\" includes an amendment to an ex isting rule. (2) In the event that the commission and division fail to reasonably comply with requirements of section 25-7-110.5 or this section, the rule shall be void and unenforceable. Judicial review of agency action under this section or section 25-7-110.5 may only be obtained by parties to the rule-making hearing and can only be broug ht regarding deficiencies or issues alleg ing a failure to comply with the requirements in section 25-7-110.5 or this section raised during or before the hearing to afford the commission, its staff, or interested parties an opportunity to address the deficiencies or issues raised.

(k) Procedures to terminat e, modify, or revoke and reissue permits for cause; procedures to revise permits, prior to renewal or termination, to incorporate applicable standards and regulations adopted after the issuance of such permit as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than eighteen months after promulg ation of the applicable requirement, or to incorporate otherwise applicable standards and regulations in the permit; except that no such revision shall be required if the effective date of the standards or regulation occurs after the permit term expires, such revision shall be treated as a permit renewal, and the defense established under subsection (3) of this section shall apply until the permit amendment is complete; (l) Procedures for incorporating emission limitations and other requirements from an applicable implementation plan, and other applicable requirements, into new or renewed permits; (m) Procedures for notify ing other contig uous states whose air quality may be affected by the emissions or that are within fifty miles of the source and for submitting comments and recommendations reg arding the proposed permit; (n) Procedures for modify ing or amending permits, and procedures for authoriz ing any chang e within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, so long as any such Page 538 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutchang e is not a modification unde r any provision of subchapter I of the federal act, and any such chang e does not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit, and advance notice is given to the division and the administrator. Such advance notice shall be no earlier than that required under regulations promulg ated pursuant to the federal act. Failure of the division to respond by the day following the last day of such advance notice period allows the source to proceed with any such chang e. (o) Procedures to make available to the public any permit application, compliance plan, permit, and monitoring or compliance report, subject to the provisions of section 25-7-119 (4). If an applicant is required to submit information entitle d to protection from disclosure, the applicant may submit such information separately .

(1) Prior to submitting an application for a permit , the applicant may request and, if so requested, the division shall grant a planning meeting with the applicant. At such meeting , the division shall advise the applicant of Page 539 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutthe applicable permit requirements, including the information, plans, specifications, and data required to be furnished with the permit application. (2) The division shall evalua te permit applications to determine, for construction permits, whether operati on of the proposed new source at the date of start-up and for operating permits, whether the permitted emissions, will comply with all applicable emission control regulations, regulations for the control of hazardous pollutants, and requirements of part 2 or 3 of this article. (3) The division shall also determine whether appli cations are for a new source activity that may have an impact upon areas which, as of the projected new source start-up date, are in compliance with national ambient air quality standards as of the date of the permit application, or for new source activity that may have an impact upon areas which, as of the projected new source start-up date, are not in comp liance with national ambient air quality standards as of the date of the permit application. (4) The division shall prepare its preliminary analy sis regarding compliance, as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, and regarding the impact on attainment or nonattainment areas, as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, as expeditiously as possible. For construction permits not subject to part 2 of this article, such preliminary analy sis shall be completed no later than sixty calendar days after receipt of a completed permit application. Applicants must be advised within sixty calendar days after receipt of any application, or supplement thereto, if and in what respects the subject application is incomplete. Upon failure of the division to so notify the applicant within sixty calendar days of its filing, the application shall be deemed complete. Applications for construction permits subject to part 2 of this article shall be approved or disapproved within twelve months of receipt of a complete application. Applications for renewable operating permits shall be approved or disapproved within eighteen months after the receipt of the complet ed permit application; except that those applications submitted within the first year after the effective date of the operating permit program shall be subject to a phased schedule for acting on such permit applications established by the division. The phased schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permits will be acted on by the division annually over a three-y ear period. The commission may establish a phased schedule for acting on applications for which a deferral has been granted pursuant to the federal act. A timely and complete permit application operates as a defense to enforcement action for operating without a permit for the period of time during which the division or the commission is reviewing the application and until such time as the division or the commission makes a final determination on the permit application; except that this defense to an enforcement action shall not be availabl e to an applicant which files a fraudulent application. (5) For those types of projects or activities for which a construction permit application has been filed, defined, or desig nated by the commission as warranting public comment with respect thereto, the division shall, within fifteen calendar days after it has prepared its preliminary analy sis, give public notice of the proposed project or activity by at least one publication in a newspaper of general distribution in the area in which the proposed project or activity, or a part thereof, is to be located or by such other method that is reasonably design ed to ensure effective general public notice. The division shall also durin g such period of time maintain in the office of the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the proposed project or activity , or a part thereof, is located a copy of its preliminary analy sis and a copy of Page 540 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutthe application with all accompany ing data for public inspection. The division shall receive and consider public comment thereon for a period of thirty calendar day s thereafter. (6) (a) For any constructio n permit application subject to the requirements of a new or modifie d major source in a nonattainment area, or for prevention of significant deterioration as provided in part 2 of this article, or for any application for a renewa ble operating permit, within fifteen calendar day s after the issuance of its preliminary analy sis, the division shall: (I) Forward to the applic ant written notice of the applicant' s right to a formal hearing before the commission with respect to the application; and (II) Give public notice of the proposed source or modification and the division' s preliminary analy sis thereof by at least one publication in a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the proposed source or modification, or by such other method that is reasonably desig ned to ensure effective general public notice. Such notice shall advise of the opportunity for a public hearing for interested persons to appear and submit written or oral comments to the commission on the air quality impacts of the source or modification, the alternatives to the source or modificatio n, the control technolog y required, if applicable, and other appropriate considerations. Any such notice shall be printed prominently in at least ten-point bold-faced type. The division shall receive and consider any comments submitted. (b) If within thirty calenda r days of publication of such public notice the applicant or an interested person submits a written request for a public hearing to the division, the division shall transmit such request to the commission along with the application, the division' s preliminary analy sis, and any written comments received by the division, within five calendar days of the end of such thirty -day period. The commission shall, within sixty calendar days after receipt of the application, comment s, and analy sis, unless such greater time is agreed to by the applicant and the division, hold a public hearing to elicit and recor d the comment of any interested person regarding the sufficiency of the preliminary analy sis and whethe r the permit application should be approved or denied. At least thirty calendar days prior to such public hearing , notice there of shall be mailed by the commission to the applicant, printed in a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the proposed source or modification, and submitted for public review with the county clerk and recorder of the county wherein the project or activity is proposed. (7) (a) Within thirty calendar days following the completion of the division' s preliminary analysis for applications for construction permits not subject to part 2 of this article, or within thirty calendar days following the period for public comment provided for in subsection (5) of this section, or for applications for construction permits subject to part 2 of this article and for renewable operating permits, if a hearing is held, within the appropriate time period established pursuant to this article, the division or the commission, as the case may be, shall grant or deny the permit application. Any permit required pursuant to this article shall be granted by the division or the commission, as the case may be, if it finds that: (I) The source or activ ity will meet all applicable emission control regulations and regulations for the control of haz ardous air pollutants; (II) The source or activity will meet the requirements of part 2 or 3 of this article, if applicable; (III) For construction permits, the source or activity will meet any applicable ambient air quality standards and all applicable reg ulations; (III.5) For renewable operating permits, the source or activity will meet all applicable regulations; and Page 541 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(IV) For renewable operating permits, the United States environmental protecti on agency has not made a timely objection to issuance of such permit pursuant to the federal act. (b) Failure of the division or commission, as the case may be, to grant or deny the permit application or permit renewal application within the time prescribed shall be treated as a final permit action for purposes of obtaining judicial revie w in the district court in which the source is located, to require that action be taken on such application by the commission or division, as appropriate, without additional delay . (c) If an applicant has submitted a timely and complete application for a renewabl e operating permit required by this article, including renew als, but final action has not been taken on such application, and, if required to have a construction permit, such construction permit is in place and valid, the source' s failure to have a renewable operating permit shall not be a violation of this article, unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the applicant to timely submit information required or requested by the division to process the application. (8) If the division denies a permit or imposes conditions upon the issuance of a permit which are contested by the applicant or if the division revokes a permit pursuant to subsection (12) of this section, the applicant may request a hearing before the commis sion. The hearing shall be held in accordance with section s 25-7-119 and 24-4-105, C.R.S. The commission may, after review of the evidence presented at the hearing , affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the division but shall, in any event, assure that all the requir ements of subsections (6) and (7) of this section are met. (9) Renewable operating permits shall summariz e existing operating restri ctions pursuant to section 25-7-114.4 (3). (10) A permit amendment will not be required to authorize a chang e in practice which is otherwise permitted pursuant to this article , the state implementation plan, or the federal act merely because an existing permit does not address the practice. Chang es in industrial practices and procedures that are not incon sistent with the terms of a renewable operating permit can be made without seeking any chang e to the terms of said permit. (11) An order of the division or commission shall be final upon issuance. Any participant in the public comment process and any other person who could obtain judicial review under applicable law shall have standing for purposes of seeking revie w of any final order of the commission or division regarding applica tions, renewals, or revisions of any permits. The public participation requirements of subsections (5) and (6) of this section shall apply to all renewable operating permit applications, revisions, and renewals. (12) (a) A permitted entity shall notify the division within fifteen days after the commencement of any activity for which a construction permit has been issued. Within one hundred eighty days after commencement of operation for which a constructio n permit has been issued, the source shall demonstrate to the division compl iance with the terms and conditions of the construction permit or the division may, pursuant to rules that are adopted by the commission based upon the results of the study conducted under section 25-7-114.7 (2)(a)(V), inspect the project or activity to determine whether or not the terms and conditions of the construction permit have been properly satisfied. At the end of one hundred eighty days after the commencement of operation, the division must: (I) Revoke the construction permit; or (II) Continue the construction permit, if applicable; or Page 542 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(III) Notify the owner or operator that the source has demonstrated compliance with the construction permit. (b) For those sources subject to the renewable operating permit program, a renewable operating permit will be issued within the appropriate time periods if all requirements for a renewa ble operating permit are met by the source. The construction permit requirements shall remain in effect until the renewable operating permit is issued. (12.5) (a) (I) Except for sources involved in agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural production such as farming , seasonal crop drying, animal feeding , or pesticide application, upon determination by the division that the criteria set forth in parag raph (b) of this subsection (12.5) applies to a source that is not required to obtain a renewable operating permit, the division may reopen such construction permit for the purpose of imposing any or all of the following additional terms and conditions: (A) Enhanced record-keeping requirements; (B) Enhanced emissions and ambient monitoring requirements; (C) Operating and maintenance requirements; and (D) Emission control requirements pursuant to section 25-7-109.3. (II) Any such condition which is contested by the permittee may be reviewed by the commission in accordance with the provisions of subsection (7) of this section. (b) With the exception of those sources involved in agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural production such as farmi ng, seasonal crop drying, animal feeding , and pesticide application, a source' s constructi on permit may be reopened for cause for the purposes of parag raph (a) of this subsection (12.5) only upon a determination by the division that the location of the source is significant in terms of its proximity to residential or busin ess areas, and one or more of the following criteria apply to the permitted source: (I) The control equipment utiliz ed by the source requires an unusually high degree of maintenance or operational sensitivity when compared to control equipment in g eneral; or (II) The design characteristics of the source require an unusually high degree of maintenance or operational sensiti vity when compared to the design characteristics of all sources in general; or (III) The application of the control equipment utiliz ed is unique or untested; or (IV) The operational variability of the source may impact the effectiveness of the controls; or (V) The emissions from the source will threaten public health, as determined pursuant to section 25-7-109.3. (c) Nothing in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection (12.5), as amended by House Bill 05-1180, as enacted at the first regular session of the sixty-fifth general assembly , shall be construed as chang ing the property tax classification of property owned by a horticultural or floricultural operation. (13) The commission shall, wherever practicable, promulg ate regulations for renewable operating permit application requirements that combine requirements for construction permits with renewable operating permits to avoid duplicative efforts by the source and the division.

Page 543 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(16) (a) If the division experiences a backlog in processing air quality permit applicati ons caused by an occasional need that is seasonal, irregular, or fluctuating in nature, and the department deter mines or reasonably expects that, as a result, permits would not be issued within statutory time frames, the division shall make available to sources that are not subject to permitting under part C of the federal act the option to have the air quality modeling that is submitted with the applicant' s air permit application reviewed for acceptance as demonstrating compliance by a contract consultant selected by the division in lieu of the review being conducted by division staff. (b) The division shall select and contract with nong overnmental air quality modeling engineers to perform air quality modeling reviews of applicants who choose contract consultant review of their air quality permit modeling . The division is not subject to the requirements of the \"Procuremen t Code\", articles 101 to 112 of title 24, C.R.S., in selecting and contracting with the consultants. The division shall review and exclude from consideration as a contract air quality modeling consultant any contr actors with a conflict of interest regarding air quality permit applications. Applicants that choose consultant review of their air quality modeling are responsible for both the consultant' s costs associated with the air modeling review as well as the division's costs associated with the review and determination of the air permit application, to be paid to the division. The division shall transfer the money to the state treasurer, who shall credit it to the stationary sources control fund created in section 25-7-114.7 (2)(b)(I ). (c) The division shall use the results of the modeling conducted pursuant to parag raph (b) of this subsection (16) for purposes of the division' s permit application analy sis.

Such notice shall specify the provision alleg ed to have been violated or not complied with and the facts alleged to constitute the violation or noncompliance. (3) (a) Within thirty calendar days after notice has been given, the division shall confer with the owner or operator of the source to determine whether a violation or noncompliance did or did not occur and, if such violation or noncompliance occurred, whether a noncompliance penalt y must be assessed under subsection (5) of this section. The division shall provide an opportunity to the owner or operator at such conference, and may provide further opportunity thereaft er, to submit data, views, and arguments concerning the alleg ed violation or noncompliance or the assessment of any noncompliance penalty . (b) If, after any such conference, a violation or noncompliance is determined to have occurred, the division shall issue an order requiring the owner or operator or any other responsible person to comply , unless the owner or operator demonstrates that such violation occurred during a period of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, and timely notice was given to the division of such condition.

(b) Except with respect to actions taken pursuant to section 25-7-112 or 25-7-113, upon the filing of such petitio n, the order and the provisions of the state implementation plan which relate to the alleged violation or noncompliance shall be stayed pending determination of the petition by the commission. Any stay pursuan t to this paragraph (b) shall be effective only as to the specific source covered by the order and such petition. (5) (a) (I) Any order issued pursuant to subsection (3) of this section which pertains to an alleg ed violation described in section 120(a)(2)(A) of the federal act shall also require each person who is subject to such order, within forty -five calendar days after the issuance of such order, to calculate the penalty owed in accordance with parag raph (b) of this subsection (5) and submit the calculation, together with a payment schedule and all information necessary for an independent verification thereof, to the division. If the order has been stayed pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, the penalty calculation shall be submitted by the owner or operator to the division within forty-five calendar days after issuance of a final determination of the commission that: (A) A violation or noncompliance occurred; (B) If a revision to the state implementation plan has been requested, all or part of such request should be denied; except that, if only part of such request is denied, the penalty calcul ation shall not be submitted for any aspect of the violation or noncompliance which is excused by reason of approval of a requested revision of the state implementation plan; (C) The violation is one described in section 120(a)(2)(A) of the federal act; and (D) If an exemption pursuant to subsection (7) of this section has been claimed, the owner or operator is not entitled thereto. (II) The division shall review the penalty calculation and schedule submitted pursuant to subpara graph (I) of this parag raph (a) and shall issue an order assessing the noncompliance penalty and providing a pay ment schedule therefor. (b) (I) The amount of the penalty which shall be assessed under this subsection (5) shall be equal to: (A) The amount, determined in accordance with section 120 of the federal act and rules and regulations promulgated under said act by the United States environmental protection agency, which shall be no less than the sum of the quarterly equivalent of the capital costs of compliance and debt service over a normal amortiz ation period of not longer than ten years, operation and maintenance costs foreg one as a result of noncompliance, and any additional value which a delay in compliance beyond July 1, 1979, may have for the owner or operator of such stationary source; less (B) The amount of any expenditure made by the owner or operator of such stationary source during any such quarter for the purpose of bring ing the source into, and maintaining compliance with, such requirement to the extent that such expenditure has not been taken into account in the calculation of the penalty under sub-subparag raph (A) of this subparag raph (I ). (II) To the extent that any expenditure under sub-subparag raph (B) of subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (b) made during any quarte r is not subtracted for such quarter from the costs under sub-subparagraph (A) of subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (b), such expenditure may be subtracted for any subsequent quarter from such costs; except that in no event shall the amount Page 550 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutpaid be less than the quarterly payment minus the amount attributed to the actual cost of construction. (c) Any penalty assessed pursuant to subsections (5) to (11) of this section shall be paid in equal quarterly insta llments (except as provided in sub-subparag raph (B) of subparag raph (I) of parag raph (b) of this subsection (5)) for the period which begins either August 7, 1979, if notice pursuant to subsection (2) of this section is issued on or before such date or which begins on the date of issuance of notice pursuant to subsection (2) of this section if such notice is issued after August 7, 1979, and which period ends on the date on which such stationary source is estimated to come into compliance. (d) Any person who fails to pay the amount of any penalty with respect to any stationary source under this subsection (5) on a timely basis shall be required to pay, in addition, a quarterly nonpay ment penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay persists.

(6) Within twenty calendar days after issuance of an order under subparag raph (II) of parag raph (a) of subsection (5) of this section, the owner or operator may file with the commission a written petition requesting a hearing to review such order. Within sixty calendar days after the filing of such petition, the commission shall hold a hearing and issue a decision thereon. (7) (a) The owner or operator of any stationary source shall be exempt from the duty to pay a noncompliance penalty pursuant to this section if after notice the owner or operator demonstrates at a hearing that the failure of such stationary source to comply is due solely to: (I) The conversion by such stationary source from the burning of petroleum products or natural gas, or both, as the primary energ y source to the burning of coal pursuant to an order under section 119 of the federal act; (II) In the case of a coal-burning source granted an extension under section 119 of the federal act, a prohibition from using petroleum products or natural gas, or both, by reason of an order under the provisions of section 2 (a) and (b) of the federal \"Energ y Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974\" or under any legislation which amends or supersedes those provisions; (III) The use of innovative technolog y sanctioned by an enforcement order under section 113 (d)(4) of the federal act; (IV) An inability to comply with such requirements for which the stationary source has received an order pursuant to section 25-7-118, which inability results from reasons entirely beyond the control of the owner or operator of such stationary source or of any entity controlling , controlled by, or under common control with the owner or operator of such stationary source; or (V) The conditions by reason of which a temporary emergency suspension is authoriz ed under section 110 (f) or (g ) of the federal act; (b) The divis ion may, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing , exempt any stationary source from the duty to pay a noncompliance penalty pursuant to this section with respect to a particular instance of noncompliance if it finds that such instance of noncompliance is inconsequential in nature and duration. Any instance of noncompliance occurring during a period of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall be deemed to be inconsequential. If a public Page 551 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printouthearing is requested by an interested person, the request shall be transmitted to the commission within twenty calendar days of its receipt by the division. The commission shall, within sixty calendar days of its receipt of the request, hold a public hearing with respect thereto and within thirty calendar day s of such hearing issue its decision. (c) An exemption under this subsection (7) shall cease to be effective if the stationary source fails to comply with the interim emission control requirements or schedules of compliance, including increments of prog ress, under any such ex tension, order, or suspension. (8) If the owner or operator of a stationary source who receives an order pursuant to subsection (5) of this section fails to submit a calculation of the penalty , a schedule for payment, and the information necessary for an independent verification thereof, the division may enter into a contract with a person who has no financial interest in the ownership or operation of the stationary source or in any person controlling , controlled by, or under common control with such stationary source to assist in determining the penalty assessmen t or payment schedule with respect to such stationary source. The cost of such contract may be added to the penalty to be assessed ag ainst the owner or operator of such stationary source. (9) (a) The division or the commission may adjust the amount of the penalty assessment or the payment schedule proposed by the owner or operator if the administrator of the United States environmental protecti on agency determines that the penalty or schedule does not meet the requirements of the federal act. (b) Upon making a determination that a stationary source which is subject to a penalt y assessment pursuant to this section is in compliance, the division shall review the actual expenditures made by the owner or operator of such stationary source for the purpose of attaining and maintaining compliance and, within one hundred eighty days after such stationary source comes into compliance, shall either provide reimbursement with interest at appropriate prevai ling rates for any overpay ment by such person or assess and collect any additional payment with interest at prevailing rates for any underpay ment by such person. (10) Any orders, payments, sanctions, or other requirements under this section shall be in addition to any other orders, pay ments, sanctions, or other requirements of this article. (11) The division or the commission may request the district attorney for the district in which the alleg ed viola tion or noncompliance, or any part thereof, occurred or may request the attorney general to bring , and if so requested it is his or her duty to bring , a suit for recovery of any penalty or nonpay ment penalty , with interest, imposed pursuant to subse ction (5) of this section if the penalty is not paid when due.

(1) The division may, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing , issue an order for any stationary source which specifies a date for final compliance with any requirement of the state implementation plan not later than the date for attainment of any national ambient air quality standard specified in such plan and in no event longer than one year after the date the order was issued, if the requirements of this section are met. If a public hearing is requested by an interested person, the request shall, within twenty days of its receipt, be transmitted to the commissio n. The commission shall, within sixty days of its receipt of the request, hold a public hearing with respect thereto and, within thirty days of such hearing , issue its decision and order.

(3) If any stationary source not in compliance with any requireme nt of the state implementation plan gives notice to the division or commission that such stationary source intends to comply by means of replacement of the facility , a complete change in its production process, or a termination of its operations, the division or commission may issue an order under this section permitting the stationary source to operate until July 1, 1979, without any interim schedule of compliance. As a condition of the issuance of any such order, the owner or operator of such stationary source shall post a bond or other surety in an amount equal to the cost of actual compliance by such facility and any economic value which may accrue to the owner or operator of such stationary source by reason of the failure to comply . If the owner or opera tor of a stationary source for which the bond or other surety required by this subsection (3) has been posted fails to replace the facility , chang e the production process, or terminate the operations as specified in the order by the required date, the owner or operator shall immediately forfeit on the bond or other surety , and the commission shall have no discretion to modify the order under this subsection (3) or to compromise the bond or other surety . (4) Any order pursuant to this section shall be terminated if the commission determines, after notice and a hearing , that the inability of the stationary source to comply no longer exists. If the owner or operator of the stationary source to which the order is issued demonstrates that prompt termination of such order would result in undue hardship, the termination shall become effective at the earliest practicable date on which such undue hardship would not result but in no event later than the date required under this section. (5) (a) If, on the basis of any informa tion available to it, the division has reason to believe that a stationary source to which an order has been issued pursuant to this section is in violation of any requirement of such order or of any provision of this section, it shall notif y the commission and the owner or operator of the alleg ed violation and may revoke such order or may commence an appropriate enforcement action pursuant to this article, or both. (b) The owner or operator shall respond as provided in section 25-7-115, and, within sixty days after receipt of such notice, the divisio n shall issue a determination thereon. If the division determines that the stationary source is in violation of any requirement of such order or of any provision of this section, it shall revoke such order and enforce compliance with the requirement with respect to which such order was granted or shall order payment of a penalty as provided in section 25-7-115, or both. (6) During the period of the order issued under this section and when the owner or operator is in compliance with the terms of such order, no other enforceme nt action pursuant to this article shall be taken against such owner or opera tor based upon noncompliance during the period the order is in effect with the requirement for the stationary source covered by such order. (7) Nothing in this section, and no delay ed compliance order granted pursuant to this section, shall be constr ued to prevent or limit the application of the emerg ency provisions of section 25-7-112 or 25-7-113. No order issued under this subsection (7) shall prevent the state from assessing penalties nor otherwise affect or limit the state's authority to enforce under other provisions of this article.

Editor's note: (1) This section was contained in an initiated measure that was adopted by the people at the general election held November 3, 1998. The measure enacting this section was effective upon proclamation of the Governor, December 30, 1998. (2) The vote count on the measure at the general election held November 3, 1998, was as follows: prohibition - phase-out - civil penalty. (1) The general assembly finds and declares that methy l tertiary butyl ether (\"MTB E\") is an oxygenate used in gasoline and other fuel products in this state and in the United States. The Page 578 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutgeneral assembly also finds that MTB E may leak into and contaminate groundwater supplies, and that MTB E is water soluble and therefore is difficult and costly to remove from water. MTB E is colorless, tastes and smells like turpentine, and can be tasted and detected by smell at extremely low concentrations. MTB E may be a human carcinog en and poses other potential health risks, including but not limited to memory loss, asthma, and skin irritation. (2) The general assembly further finds and declares that water is precious and vital to this state's growing population, agricultural industry , and unique environment. Therefore it is the intent of the genera l assembly in enacting this section to halt further contamination and pollution of this state' s groundwater supplies by MTB E. (3) (a) (I) Except as otherwise provided in this parag raph (a), a person may not sell, offer for sale, or store any fuel product containing or treated with MTB E. (II) The provisions of this parag raph (a) shall not apply if the presence of MTB E in a fuel product is caused solely by incidental comming ling of MTB E with the fuel product during storag e or transf er of the fuel product. In no event shall the provisions of this subsection (3) be construed to permit the knowing or willful addition of MTB E to any fuel product. (b) (Deleted by amendment, L . 2005, p. 283, \u00a7 21, effective Aug ust 8, 2005.) (c) For purposes of this section, \"fuel product\" mean s gasoline, reformulated gasoline, benz ine, benz ene, naphtha, benz ol, and kerosene and any other volatile and inflammable liquid that is produced, compounded, and offered for sale or used for the purpose of generating power in internal combustion engines or generating heat or light or used for cleaning or for any other similar usag e.

Actions of federal governm ent affecting visibility - evaluation report. (1) As a part of the state' s ongoing development and implementation of a long-term strateg y in connection with visibility and air quality related values within class I areas, the division shall evaluate the extent to which the activities of the federal government are directly adversely impacting visibility and air quality related values within a class I area and make a determination whether such entities have taken or are taking all reasonable steps necessary to remedy that impact. At any time, the division may make, and a federal land manag er shall respond to, reasonable requests for information necessary for the division to perform such reg ulation. (2) The joint public hearing required under section 25-7-105 (4)(a ) shall report on the results of the evaluation required under subsection (1) of this section. (3) (a) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares, after reviewing the factors that contribute to regional haze and visibility impa irment in Colorado, that significant contributions to regional haze and visibility impairment emanate from feder al lands within the state of Colorado and from federal lands in other parts of the west. For the purpose of addressing regional haze visibilit y impairment in Colorado' s mandatory class I federal areas, the federal land manag er of each such area shall develop a plan for evaluating visibility in that area by visual observation or other appropriate monitoring technique approved by the federal environmental protection agency and shall submit such plan for approval to the division for incorporation by the commissi on as part of the state implementation plan. Such submittal and compliance by the federal land manag ers shall be done in a manner and at a time so as to meet all present or future federal requirements for the protection of visibility in any mandatory class I federal area. Such plan shall only be approved by the commission if the expense of implementing such a plan is borne by the federal g overnment. (b) (I) In addition to the plan submitted by each federal land manag er pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (3), the responsible federal land manag ement agency shall provid e an emission inventory to the commission of all federal land manag ement activities in Colorado or other states that result in the emission of criteria pollutants, including surrog ates or precursors for such pollutants, that affect any mandatory class I federal area in Colorado by reducing visibility in such an area. Such emiss ion inventory shall be submitted to the Page 584 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutcommission no later than December 31, 2001, and no less freque ntly than every five years thereafter.

The attainment program embodied in the state implementation plan may, with respect to proposed new or modified major stationary sources within nonattainment areas which would cause or contribute to a violation of a national ambient air quality standard, provide an allowance for growth while providing reasonable further progress toward attainment, and new sources may be allowed that do not result, individually or in the aggregate, in emissions that exceed the allowance. Particulate matter not of a size or substance to adversely affect public health or welfare shall not be considered in determining whether any applicable growth allowance has been consumed. Modifications to an existing facility within a source may be allowed which are accompanied by emission reduction offsets within the same source sufficient to provide no net increase in emissions of an air polluta nt from the source. If an applicable growth allowance has been consumed, the attainment program shall permit sources to be constructed only if emission reduction offsets providing a greater than one- for-one emission reduction are obtained from existing sources sufficient to provide reasonable further progress toward attaining the applicable national ambient air quality standards by the attainmen t date prescribed under Part D (Nonattainment Prog ram) of the federal act. Any emission offsets required for sulfur dioxide, particulates, and carbon monox ide shall provide a positive net air quality benefit in the area affected by the proposed source.

(1) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that air pollution in the state of Colorado is a threat to the health and welfare of its citizens and that a major contributor to said pollution is wood smoke, which accounts for twenty - five to forty percent of the brown cloud, fifteen to thirty percent of small particulate matter, hereafter referred to as PM 10, up to ten percent of carbon monox ide, and a portion of toxic, cancer-causing chemicals. (2) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that PM 10 particulates created by wood burning threaten the public health in that said particul ates are so small that they lodge in persons' lungs and inhibit the body 's pulmonary function. Such pollutant is particularly damag ing to persons with lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and chronic upper respiratory conditions, to the very young and elderly , and to pregnant women. The brown cloud is a threat to the economic health of the state because it discourages businesses and tourists from coming to Colorado. Wood burning is one of the most easily controllable sources of air pollution. New techno logies can dramatically reduce pollution caused by wood burning . In addition, the reduction of wood burning can reduce the amount of fine particulate emissions into the air. (3) Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is necessary to implement a plan to further reduce wood smoke emissions in the AIR program area and, therefore, enacts sections Page 591 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout25-7-411 to 25-7-413 to encourage and promote the reduction of wood-burning devices and the use of less polluting devices by taking advantag e of new technolog y.

Methods for reducing wood smoke in program area. (1) Methods for reducing wood smoke in the prog ram area may be implemented, as follows: (a) Voluntary financial incentives. The lead air quality planning agency for the Denver metropolitan area shall work with other organizations to establish a program of financial incentives to encourag e and defray the costs associated with conversions to Phase III wood stoves or to gas or electric devices. The program shall include incentives to use energ y efficient devices. (b) Educa tional program . The lead air quality planning agency for the Denver metropolitan area shall work with public and private organizations to promote the following : The voluntary upgrade of conventi onal wood-burning stoves to Phase III stoves and the conversion of ex isting conventional fireplaces to fireplace inserts or to g as or electric devices; (c) Voluntary conversions. (I) The commissi on shall establish goals for voluntary conversion of wood-burning units to cleaner burning technolog y to be met by December 31, 1994, and by December 31, 1997. The primary objective of the goals shall be to attain and maintain standards for particulate matter established pursuant to the federal \"Clean Air Act\", taking into account other strateg ies adopted in the state implementation plan. The goals established by the commission may not ex ceed the following max imum levels: (A) The conversion or nonuse of one hundred thousand conventional wood-burning fireplaces to clean technolog y by December 31, 1994, and one hundred fifty thousand by December 31, 1997; (B) The conversion or nonuse of twenty thousa nd conventional wood stoves to Phase III wood stoves by December 31, 1994, and thirty thousand conversions by December 31, 1997. (II) The goals established pursuant to subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (c) may be less than the maximum levels if the commission determines that such nonuse or conversions are not necessary to attain and maintain federal particulate matter standards. Page 592 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(d) Contingency plan. (I) In the event that goals establishe d in parag raph (c) of this subsection (1) are not met, or the commission determines that wood-burning controls are necessary to either attain or maintain the standards for particulate matter established pursuant to the 1990 amendments to the federal \"Clean Air Act\", taking into account other strateg ies, the commission shall develop and implement a conting ency plan. (II) Prior to the development of the conting ency plan, the commissio n shall contract with an independent contractor to conduct a random survey of the program area to determine public preferences for various wood smoke reduction strateg ies and shall hold a public hearing before adopting any recommendations concerning wood smoke reduction strateg ies, which recommendations shall be submitted to the g eneral assembly for action. (III) Strateg ies survey ed for public preference and considered by the commission for inclusion in the conting ency plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the following : (A) Charging a fee for residents of dwelling s who wish to burn wood in a conventional stove or fireplace and using the fee for conversion incentives, enforcement of rules against burning wood without having paid a fee, and monitoring for compliance with rules; (B) Conv ersion to clean burning devices upon the sale of a dwelling unit containing a conventional fireplace or non-Phase I II wood stove; (C) Removal of the ex emption for primary heat sources on no-burn day s; (D) A permit-to-burn program with a maximum number of permits determined by the commission and issued in a random but proportional manner throug hout the prog ram area. (2) Verifying voluntary conversions. To measure and verify progress in regard to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall do the following : (a) The commission shall develop measures for obtaining from consumers in the program area pledg es not to use any device other than a Phase III wood stove, fireplace insert, or a gas or electric fireplace; and (b) The department of revenue shall adopt a procedure for tracking conversions of non- Phase III wood stoves and fireplaces and, if applicable, the number of non-Phase III wood stoves permanently destroy ed, which procedure shall include a requirement that retailers regularly submit to the commission the number of consumer purchases of Phase III wood stoves or inserts or gas or electric fireplaces. (3) Wood smoke reductio n fee - termination. (a) On and after July 1, 1992, any retailer who sells a new wood stove or insert or a gas or electric fireplace or fireplace that uses a gas or electric device in the program area shall obtain from the purchaser a signed conversion form, which form shall be provided by the department of revenue, or an entity with which the department is hereby authoriz ed to contract, affirming the purchase of such device and indicating whether the purchase is in connection with a conversion to a cleaner burning device. In addition to obtaining the signed conversion form, the retailer shall submit to the department of revenue in accordance with parag raph (b) of this subsection (3) a fee in the amount of one dollar. (b) On and after July 1, 1992, and in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection (3), the retailer shall submit to the department of revenue the conversion form along with the fee described in paragraph (a) of this subsection (3). The department of revenue shall transmit the fee to the state treasurer who shall credit the same to the wood smoke reduction fund, which fund is hereby created. The money s in the fund shall be subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly to the department of revenue to cover the direct and indirect costs of developing a conversion form in accordance with parag raph (a) of this subsection (3), tracking Page 593 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutconversion in accordance with parag raph (a) of this subsection (3) and paragr aph (b) of subsection (2) of this section, and for the department of public health and environment to conduct a survey in connection with the implementation of a conting ency plan in accordance with parag raph (d) of subsection (1) of this section; except that no money s shall be used for conducting a survey in connection with the implementation of a conting ency plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of this section without specific approval by the joint budg et committee. In accordance with section 24-36-114, C.R.S., all interest derived from the deposit and investment of this fund shall be credited to the general fund. The department of revenue, or the entity with which the department has contracted pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (3), shall submit a report to the commission on the number of conversions no later than thirty days after receiving reports from retailers in accordance with parag raph (c) of this subsection (3). (c) The retailer shall submit semi-annual reports to the department of revenue no later than on the twentieth day of the month after the close of the preceding six-month period together with the conversion forms and the remittance for all fees collected for the preceding six-month period. I f no fees are submitted by the retailer, no report is necessary . (d) Effective July 1, 1997, the wood smoke reduction fund and the wood smoke reduction fee are eliminated, and the following provisions shall apply : (I) A retailer within the program area that sells a new wood stove or insert, or a gas or electric fireplace that uses a gas or electric device, between January 1, 1997, and June 30, 1997, shall submit a final semi-annual report to the department of revenue no later than July 20, 1997, together with: (A) Signed conversion forms indic ating whether such purchases were made in connection with a conversion to a cleaner burning device; and (B) A remittance of the wood smoke reduction fees collected during such period.

(1) The general assembly hereby declares that it is in the interest of the general public to control the exposure of the general public to friable asbestos. It is the intent of the general assembly to ensure the health, safety , and welfare of the public by regulating the practice of asbestos abatement in locations to which the general public has access for the purpose of ensuring that such abatement is performed in a manner which will minimiz e the risk of release of asbestos. However, it is not the intent of the general assembly to regulate occupation al health practices which are regulated pursuant to federal laws or to grant any authority to the department of public health and environment to enter and regulate work areas where general public access is limited. It is the intent of the general assembly that the commission may adopt regulations to permit the enforcement of the national emission standards for haz ardous air pollutants as set forth in 42 U.S.C. sec. 7412. (2) Therefore, the general assembly determines and declares that the enactment of this part 5 is a matter of statewide concern to achieve statewid e uniformity in the regulation of such asbestos abatement practices and uniformity in the qualifications for and certification of persons who perform such abatement.

(1) The federal land manag er of a class I federal area may initiate the Page 611 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutprocedures of this part 10 by submitting to the governor and division an assertion of significant impairment of an air quality related value, referred to in this part 10 as an \"assertion\" . To be adequate to support a verification of impairment, the assertion shall be supported by sufficient air quality related value baseline data and site-specific evidence of impairment. The assertion may be supported in part by information that concerns other areas with a similar environment to the class I federal area asserted to be impaired, provided such infor mation is relevant to the class I federal area asserted to be impaired and sig nificant site-specific data is also available. (2) Upon receipt of an assertion, the division shall initiate the following action s concurrently : (a) Inform the commission at its next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the receipt of an assertion, at which time the commissio n shall schedule the matter for a formal report from the division at the regular commission meeting that is scheduled to occur six months subsequent. All such informational briefing s and formal reports on the subject shall be noticed on the published ag enda of the commission. (b) Within sixty days of receipt of the assertion, the division shall convene a peer review panel to review the assertion, its supporting documentation, including the adequacy of the baseline data and the adequacy of the site-specific and other evidence of impairment, and any other relevant information submitted to the division by the public. The requirement for peer review as specified in this parag raph (b) is waived with respect to any peer reviewer who has not submitted peer review comments within sixty days of the date on which the division certifies that the assertion, documentation, and other information has been transmitted to the individual peer reviewers. (c) Convene a consultation process that is open to the public in order to apprise the public and potentially affected sources and source categ ories of all stages of the program and to solicit the scientific, technical, economic, and manag erial views and assistance of the public and the potentially affected sources and source categ ories; and (d) Initiate a review by division staff of the assert ion and the supporting documentation submitted by the federal land manager to assess whether the federal land manag er has demonstrated a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I federal area within Colorado. (3) At the commission meeting required by paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section, the division shall report to the commission. The division' s report shall include, but is not limited to, the conclusions of the peer review panel concerning verification of the assertion and the division' s determination of whether the federal land manager has demonstrated a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I area within Colorado. If the division determines that the assertion has not been verified, it shall so notify the commission and the federal land manag er of its finding s and the fact that the proceeding s authoriz ed under this part 10 have been complet ed. If the division determines that the assertion has been verified, it shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 25-7-1006.

The general assembly recog nizes that the ability to attribute the cause of air pollution effects and apportion the air pollution effects among sources and source categ ories identified by attribution studies is an area of evolving science. (2) (a) The funding of source attribution and apportionment studies shall be derived as provided in this subsection (2). Contribut ions to support the funding of such studies shall be requested from sources and source categories identified by the division as potentially contributing to the impairment. (b) If a potential contrib ution to impairment is identified from federal lands or state lands, the division shall reques t a funding contribution for such studies from the appropriate federal or state land manag er. (c) If a potential contribution to impairment is identifi ed from stationary sources or source categories, the division shall request a funding contribution for such studies from such sources or source categ ories. (d) If a potential contribution to impairment is identified from mobile sources, the division shall seek an appropriation by the general assembly of excess funds in the AIR account in the hig hway users tax fund for funding contributions to such studies. (e) The division shall annually report to the legislative council on the adequacy of funding derived pursuant to this subsection (2). If funding derived pursuant to this subsection (2) is inadequate, the legislative council may recommend that the general assembly appropriate funds from available sources for purposes of this section. (3) Following its review and analy sis of the reasonable attribution and source apportionment studies and the reports thereon from the members of the peer review panel, the division shall identify those sources and source categ ories within the state and region significantly contributing to air quality related value impairment. (4) The divis ion shall identify the sources and source categories significantly contributing to air quality related value impairment that are located outside the state and report this list to the commission, governor, and general assembly for their consideration in identify ing options for remedy ing such impacts. (5) The division shall issue an order to the sources and source categ ories significantly contributing to air quality related value impairment located within the state that have not made a voluntary enforceable commitment under section 25-7-1008. (6) (a) An order issued pursuant to subsection (5) of this section shall require: (I) Such sources and source categ ories to submit a report within a reasonable period of time; (II) A stationary source to identify the best available retrofit technolog y; and (III) Other sources and source categ ories to identify reasonably available control measures.

(1) Upon receipt of a report under section 25-7-1006 (6)(b) from the division, and after the division has made the report available to all significant source or source categ ories identified pursuant to section 25-7-1006, the commission shall give notice that it is to conduct a rule- making hearing concerning the implementation of control strateg ies recommended in the report. (2) In addition to other applicable rule-making provisions, the rule-making hearing shall be conducted: (a) I n reasonable prox imity to the affected class I federal area; (b) To allow sufficient time for comment and testimony by all interested persons; and (c) To allow reasonable discovery pursuant to section 24-4-103 (13) and (14), C.R.S. (3) (a) The commission shall order by rule implementation within a reasonable time of a practical and cost-effective control strateg y or strateg ies that will provide reasonable progress toward remedy ing the impairment, if the commission finds that: (I) The evidence in the record shows the existence of a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I federal area; (II) An identifiable source or source categ ory is responsible for significantly causing or contributing to the impairment; (III) The best available retrofit technolog y exists for any such stationary source; (IV) Reasonably available control measur es exist for any such other sources or source categ ories; (V) Implementation of the control strateg ies would make significant improvement in the impairment; (VI) Taking into accou nt that the ability to attribute the cause of air pollution effects and to apportion the air pollution effects among sources and source categories ident ified by attributi on studies is an area of evolving science, a correlation of the extent of improvement in air quality related value impairment can reasonably be expected to result from imposit ion of a control strateg y or strateg ies for each significant source or source categ ory identified by the division. (b) Within fourteen days after having received the division' s report under section 25-7- 1006 (6)(b), a source or source category may petition the commission, as part of its rule-making hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection (3), to make a determination that the benefits of phasing , segmenting , or excusing the control strategy or strategies outweig h the benefits of imposing the control strateg y or strateg ies. In making such determination, the commission shall consider all economi c and related costs associated with the implementation of the control strateg y or strateg ies involving the source or source categ ory. The burden of proof shall be on the petitioner. Source: L. 96: Entire part added, p. 1448, \u00a7 1, effective J une 1. Page 614 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout25-7-1008. Voluntary agreem ents. (1) The divisi on may convene, at any appropriate time, an informal voluntary negotiation process, with appropriate public partic ipation, to seek voluntary enforceable commitments from sources and source categ ories to achieve emissions reductions sufficient to make reasonable further progress in reducing any portion of the impairment. (2) A voluntary enforceable commitment becomes enforceable throug h a commission rule, local ordinance or resolution, judicially enforceable consent decree, or division permit condition, as appropriate to the circumstances. (3) If subsequent to January 15, 1996, a source or source categ ory agrees to an enforceable commitment to adopt a control strateg y that the division determ ines is as effective or is more effective than best available retrofit technolog y for stationary sources or reasonably available control measures for nonstationary sources, the division shall exempt that source or source categ ory from the imposition of further controls pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from the date established for achieving the emission reductions as specified in the voluntary enforceable ag reement. (4) If subsequent to January 15, 1996, and prior to January 15, 1998, a source or source categ ory agrees to an enforceable commitment contained in a judicially enforceable consent decree to adopt a control strategy that the division determines provides both for reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal under 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart P and 5 CCR 1001-4 and for reasonable progress in reducing any prese nt or future impairment of an air quality related value, the division shall exempt that source or source categ ory from the imposition of further controls pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from the date established for achieving the emission reductions as specified in the judicially enforceable consent decree. The provisions of section 25-7-133 shall not apply to that portion of an amendment to the visibility component of the state implementation plan that implements and enforces the control strateg y covered by this subsection (4). (5) If a source or source categ ory agrees to an enforceable commitment to adopt a control strateg y that the division determines is not as effective as best available retrofit techno logy for stationary sources or reasonably available control measures for nonstationary sources but that the division determines will assist in making reasonabl e further progress in reducing impairment of an air quality relate d value, the commission may, after public hearing , exempt that source or source categ ory from the imposition of further controls pursuant to this part 10 with respect to those pollutants that the source or source categ ory has agreed to control for a period of up to ten years from the date established for achieving the emission reduct ions as specified in the voluntary enforceable ag reement. (6) A source that, prior to June 1, 1996, has received a permit under the federal prevention of significant deterioration program, 42 U.S.C. secs. 7470 to 7479 or sections 25-7- 201 to 25-7-210, and installed pollution control measures comparable to the best available control technolog y pursuant to that program shall not be required to install additional control measures pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from June 1, 1996, but may be required to operate pollution control equipment to its maximum efficiency . This section shall not apply to any source that is not subject to compliance with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. sec. 7651 (f), which establishes schedules and emission limitations for the contr ol of nitrog en oxide emissions from certain stationary sources. Nothing in this subse ction (6) shall be construed to modify the terms of any permit applicable to such source or excuse compliance with respect to Page 615 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutany other requiremen t under this article or the federal act. Except for the exemption for a period of ten years provided in this subsection (6), nothing in this subsection (6) shall excuse such sources from responding to reasonable requests by the division for information requi red to complete inventories and attribution and apportionment studies.

The goal of the state should not be the removal of all lead-based paint, but the creation of housing and facilities wher e no significant lead-based paint hazard is present. This goal includes the removal, enclosure, or encapsulation of lead-based paint to remove lead haz ards from targ et housing and child-occupied facilities. (2) The general assembly declares that the enforcement of the lead-based paint abatement standards may be deleg ated to local health and building departments in Colorado. (3) Therefore, the general assembly determines and declares that the enactment of this part 11 is a matter of statewide concern to achieve uniformity in the regulation of lead abatement practices and uniform ity in the qualifications for and certification of persons who perform such abatement.

The general assembly hereby finds, determin es, and declares that voluntary emission limitations are an effective and efficient way to reduce emissions of air pollutants. However, the uncertainty of future control requirements impedes an owner or operator of a stationary source or group of stationary sources from making the investments necessary to voluntarily reduce emissions. The department of public health and environment should encourag e all owners and operators of stationary sources or groups of stationary sources to voluntarily reduce emissions by providing, to the extent possible, certainty with respect to future control requirements.

I n addition, the following definitions shall apply to this part 12: (1) \"Actual emissions\" means the averag e amount of emissions, calculated in tons per year, that the stationary source or group of stationary sources emitted during the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division for review so long as the three-y ear time period is represen tative of normal unit operation. A different time period may be used to calculate actual emissions if such time period is more representative of normal unit operation than the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division. Page 619 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(2) \"Actual emission rate\" means the averag e rate of emissions, calculated in pounds per million BTU or a comparable measure of the mass of emissions per unit of production, that the stationary source or group of stationary sources emitted during the three-y ear period immedia tely prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division for review so long as the three-y ear time period is representative of normal unit operation. A different time period may be used to calculate the actual emission rate if such time period is more representative of normal unit operation than the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division.

(1) The owner or operator of any stationary source or group of stationary sources may obtain regulatory assurance, as described in section 25-7- 1204, by entering into a voluntary agreement pursuant to this part 12. The parties to the proposed voluntary agreement shall negotiate in good faith to reach a voluntary agreement as expeditiously as possible. The owner or operator shall provide the division with any information necessary to evaluate the terms and conditions of the proposed voluntary agreement. The parties to the proposed voluntary agreement shall structure the emission limitations or emission reductions contained in a voluntary agreement so as to minimiz e costs and maximize the operational flexibility available to the owner or operator of the stationary source or group of stationary sources by using, among other thing s, numeric emission limits, annual emission limits, or emissions averag ing across several emission points or sources, as appropriate. (2) The division shall evaluate the emission limitations contained in a proposed voluntary agreement to determine whether they will result in reductions in actual emissions or actual emission rates, will result in emission reductions earlier than would be required by existing laws or regulations, will result in emission reductions significantly greater than required by existing laws or regulations, and will protect human health or the environment. The division shall also evaluate the assurance period proposed in the voluntary agreement based on the following factors: (a) The environmental benefits of the emission limitations and their sig nificance; (b) The time necessary to achieve the emission limitations; (c) The capital, operating , and other costs associated with achieving the emission limitations; and (d) The energ y impacts and environmental impacts not related to air quality of achieving the emission limitations. (3) After conducting the evaluation required in subsection (2) of this section, the division may reject any proposed voluntary agreement that does not meet the requirements of this section. If the division rejects the proposed voluntary agreement, the owner or operator of the stationary source or group of stationary sources may petition the commission for review of the proposed voluntary agreement and the division' s rejection thereof in accordance with the rules promulg ated by the commission. (4) If the division finds that the emission limitations and the assurance period proposed in a voluntary agreement meet the requirements of this section, the division shall submit the proposed voluntary agreement to the commission for approval. The commission shall provide the public with notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed voluntary agreement. The Page 620 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutcommission shall act upon the voluntary agreement as expeditiously as possible. The commission shall approve the voluntary agreement unless it finds by substantial evidence that the proposed voluntary agreement is inconsistent with the requirements of this part 12. In no event shall the commission adopt emission limitations or an assurance period different than proposed in the voluntary agreement without the express written approval of the owner or operator of the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources subject to the ag reement. (5) If the commission approves the proposed voluntary agreement, the emission limitations and other provisions contained in the voluntary agreement shall be enforceable under this article against the stationary source or group of stationary sources in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the voluntary agreement. Such enforcement may include any appropriate mechanism, including rule, permit condition, or consent order. (6) No voluntary agreement or the underly ing emission limitations under subsection (1) of this sectio n shall be made federally enforceable without the written consent of the owner or operator of the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources. (7) Except as provided in this part 12 or other applicable law, no voluntary agreement entered into under this part 12 shall alter any existing federal or state requirement otherwise applicable to the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources subject to such ag reement. (8) The commission may adopt any rules, procedures, or combination thereof necessary to implement this part 12. Notwithstanding this authority , the division may negotiate and evaluate proposed voluntary agreements, and the commission may approve proposed voluntary agreements and review the division's rejection of a proposed voluntary agreement as of July 1, 1998.

(1) Except as provided in this section and in section 25-7-1205, the owner or operator of a stationa ry source or group of stationary sources who enters into a voluntary agreement pursuant to section 25-7-1203 shall be granted the regulatory assurances provided in this section. For the assurance period set forth in the voluntary agreement, not to exceed fifteen years, a stationary source or group of stationary sources subject to the voluntary agreement shall not be required to install additional pollution control equipment or implement additional pollution control strateg ies to reduce emissions of the air pollutant subject to the emission limitations contained in the voluntary agreement in order to comply with: (a) State regulatory requirements that are based exclusively on state authority and that, either directly or indirectly , necessitate reductions in the air pollutant subject to the voluntary agreement; or (b) F ederal reg ulatory requirements that: (I) Either directly or indirectly necessitate reductions in emissions of the air pollutant subject to the voluntary agreement; (II) Establish generally applicable goals for the reductions of ambient concentrations of the air pollutant subject to the voluntary agreement or its chemical products; and (III) Do not establish requirements that apply specifically to the stationary source or group of stationary sources. Page 621 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the owner or operator of the stationary source or group of stationary sources may be required to comply with federal regulatory requirements if: (a) The owner or operator has ag reed in writing to abide by the requirements; or (b) The commission promulg ates the requirements in regulations that first require all other sources, including mobile sources, of the air pollutant within the affected region within Colo rado to implement all available cost-effective measures to reduce emissions of the air pollut ant. Such regulations, including the requirements contained therein applicable to the stationary source or group of stationary sources subject to the voluntary agreement, shall not apply to any stationary source or group of stationary sources unless and until the general assembly acts to postpone the expiration of the regulations in accordance with section 24-4-103, C.R.S.

(1) (a) If the owner or operator of a coal-fired power plant or group of coal-fired power plants reduces the uncontrolled sulfur dioxide emission rate, measured in either pounds per million BTU or tons per year, by an averag e of at least seventy percent and the actual emission rate of sulfur dioxide by an averag e of at least fifty percent from one or more units located within the same airshed, regardless of whether the units are located on the same plant site, and such reductions are pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into under section 25-7-1203, the assurance period for such units shall be a period ending fifteen years after the date established for achiev ing the voluntary emission limitations under the ag reement. (b) If the owner or operator of any coal-fired power plant that includes one or more units, each of which already has emission control technolog ies in place to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least sixty-five percent from uncontr olled levels, significantly reduces the actual emission rate of sulfur dioxide and such reduction is pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into under section 25-7-1203, the assurance period for such units shall be no more than fifteen years from the date the emissions reductions are achieved. Such a coal-fired power plant that is the subject of a certification of visibility impairmen t in a federally designated class 1 area as of Page 622 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified PrintoutJuly 1, 1998, may not enter into a voluntary agreement addressing the pollutants subject to the certification of visibility of impairment under section 25-7-1203 unless: (I) The owner or operator of the plant has negotiated a settlement with the divisio n that resolves all matters related to such certification of visibility impairment; and (II) The voluntary agreement is fully consistent with the terms and conditions of the negotiated settlement. (c) A coal-fired power plant or group of plants may achieve the emission reductions required by this section throug h a volunt ary agreement that allows the plant or group of plants to control emissions by methods other than the installation and operation of pollution control equipment. Such methods may include but are not limited to burning low-sulfur coal, reducing the operation of units, retiring units, and chang ing fuels. If such methods are included in a voluntary agreement, the agreement shall include the procedure by which the division shall calculate the emission reductions to be obtained by such methods. (2) It is the intent of the general assembly that the comm ission should consider any coal- fired power plant or power plants located within the same airshed that are achieving the emission limitations described in this section under a voluntary agreement to be in compliance with any emission limitation that is based on a technology requirement in the federal act. Such consideration should continue for a period of fifteen years after the date established in the voluntary agreement for achieving the emission limitations that are contai ned in the voluntary agreement. During the fifteen-y ear period, the commission, by rule, may require the coal-fired power plant to meet a different emission limitation based on a technolog y requirement in the federal act if: (a) The commission finds that a different emission limitation is necessary to compl y with the federal act; and (b) The owner or operator of the coal-fired power plant is not required to begin installation of the required emission control technol ogy unless and until the general assembly has acted to postpone the expiration of the commission' s rule in accordance with section 24-4-103, C.R.S. (3) The general assembly further intends that nothing in subsection (2) of this section shall be construed to create a precedent for the application or interpretation of either the \"Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act\", article 7 of title 25, C.R.S., or the federal act in any circumstance other than the execution of voluntary agreements between the state of Colorado and the owners and operators of coal-fired power plants in accordance with this part 12.

(2) In the formulation of each control regulation, the commission shall consider the following : (a) The need for regulations that control discharg es of specified pollutants that are the subject of water quality standards for the receiving state waters; (b) The need for regulations that specify treatment requirements for various types of discharg es; (c) The degree to which any particular type of discharg e is subject to treatment, the availability , practicality , and techn ical and economic feasibility of treatment techniques, and the extent to which the discharg e to be controlled is sig nificant; (d) Control requirements promulg ated by agencies of the federal g overnment; (e) The continuous, intermittent, or seasonal nature of the discharg e to be controlled; (f) Whether a regulation that is to be applicable to discharg es into flowing water should be written in such a way that the degree of pollution tolerated or treatment required will be Page 643 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutdependent upon the volume of flow of the recei ving water or the extent to which the discharg e is diluted therein, or the capacity of the receiving water to assimilate the discharg e; and (g) The need for specification of safety precautions that should be taken to protect water quality including , but not limited to, requirements for the keeping of logs and other records, requirements to protect subsurface waters in connection with mining and the drilli ng and operation of wells, and requirements as to settling ponds, holding tanks, and other treatment facilities for water that will or mig ht enter state waters. (3) Control regulations may be promulgated for use in connection with any one or more of the classes of state waters authoriz ed pursuant to section 25-8-203 and may be made applicable with respect to any desig nated portion of state waters or to all state waters. (4) The commission shall coordinate and cooperate with the state engineer, the Colorado water conservation board, the oil and gas conservation commission, the state board of health, and other state agencies having regulatory powers in order to avoid adopting control regulations that would be either redundant or unnecessary . (5) The commission shall not adopt control regulations that require agricultural nonpoint source discharg ers to utilize treatment techniques that require additional consump tive or evaporative use which would cause material injury to water rights. With regard to nonpoint source water pollution control related to agricultural practices, the commission and division shall pursue incentive, grant, and cooperative programs in preference to the promulgation of control regulations. When interested water conservation districts, water conservancy districts, and conservation districts recommend nonpoint source control activities related to agricultural practices to the division and commission, the division and commission, after consultation with such districts, shall give substantial weig ht to the recommendations of such districts into the approved program. Except as provided by section 25-8-205.5, control regulations related to agricultural practices shall be promulgated only if incentive, grant, and cooperative programs are determined by the commission to be inadequate and such regulations are necessary to meet state law or the federal act. This subsection (5) does not allocate wasteloads or relieve any source from participation in wasteload allocations determined necessary under any duly promulg ated regulations established by the water quality control commission under this section. (6) The division may issue a variance from a control regulation of general applicability , based upon a determination that the benefits derived from meeting the control regulation do not bear a reasonable relationship to the economic, environmental, or energy impacts or other factors which are particular to the applicant in comply ing with the control regulation; except that such variance shall be consistent with the purposes of this article including the protection of existing beneficial uses. No variance shall be issued for longer than five years. Variances shall be granted or renewed according to the procedure established in section 25-8-401 (5).

(1) No person shall discharg e any pollutant into any state water from a point source without first having obtained a permit from the division for such discharg e, and no person shall discharg e into a ditch or man-made convey ance for the purpose of evading the requirement to obtain a permit under this article. No person covered by this article shall use or dispose of biosolids, except as authoriz ed by regulations that shall not be more restrictive than the requirements adopted for solid wastes disposal sites and facilities pursuant to part 1 of articl e 20 of title 30, C.R.S., except Page 667 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutas necessary to be consistent with section 405 of the federal act. Existing authoriz ation for the use or disposal of biosolids shall continue until permits are issued in accordance with this part 5. Each application for a permit duly filed under the federal act shall be deemed to be a permit application filed under this article, and each permit issued pursuant to the federal act shall be deemed to be a temporary permit issued under this article which shall expire upon expiration of the federal permit. (2) The division shall examine applications for and may issue, suspend, revoke, modify , deny , and otherwise administer permits for the discharg e of pollutants into state waters and for the use and disposal of biosolids. Such administration shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article and regulations promulg ated by the commission. Until modi fied pursuant to this article, final permits shall be g overned by their ex isting limitations. (3) The commission shall promulg ate such regulations as may be necessary and proper for the orderly and effective administrati on of permits for the discharg e of pollutants, which regulations shall include, but not be limited to, procedures for the issuance of a varian ce pursuant to section 25-8-503 (4), and shall also require that, in appropriate circumstances, the effluent limitations contained in a permit shall be adjusted to account for the pollutan ts contained in the discharg er's intake water. Such regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of this article and with federa l requirements and shall be in furtherance of the policy contained in section 25-8- 102. Such regulations shall establish a permit process that allows permit conditions to remain in effect as long as circumstances dictate those conditions. In order to comply with federal requirements, but not to lessen compliance with federal standards, such permit process may require periodic renewal of permits even where minimal or no chang es in the permit conditions are necessa ry. Renewal shall be required where more than minimal chang es in permit conditions are necessary . The regulations may pertain to and implement, among other matters, permit and permit application contents, procedures, requireme nts, and restrictions with respect to the following : (a) Identification and address of the owner and operator of the activity , facility , or process from which the discharg e is to be permitted; (b) L ocation and quantity and quality characteristics of the permitted discharg e; (c) Effluent limitations and conditions for treatment prior to discharg e to a publicly owned treatment works; (d) Monitoring as well as record-keeping and reporting requirements consistent with standard procedures and methods established by the division; (e) Schedules of compliance; (f) Procedures to be followed by division personnel for entering and inspecting premises; (g) Submission of pertinent plans and specifications for the facility , process, or activity which is the source of a waste discharg e; (h) Restrictions on transfers of the permit; (i) Procedures to be followed in the event of expansion or modification of the process, facility , or activity from which the discharge occurs or the quality , quantity , or frequency of the discharg e; (j) Duration of the permit and renewal procedures using a risk-based approach that limits the amount of work required to renew permits that have minimal or no chang es in the permit conditions to streamline the renewal process; Page 668 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(k) Authority of the division to require chang es in plans and specifications for control facilities as a condition for the issuance of a permit; (l) Identification of control regulations over which the permit takes preceden ce and identification of control reg ulations over which a permit may never take precedence; (m) Notice requirements of any intent to construct, install, or alter any process, facility , or activity that is likely to result in a new or altered discharg e; (n) Effectiveness under this article of permit applications submitted to and permits issued by the federal g overnment under the federal act. (4) Nothing in any permit shall ever be construed to prevent or limit the application of any emerg ency power of the division. (5) Every permit issued for a domestic wastewater treatment works shall contain such terms and conditions as the division determines to be necessary or desirable to assure continuing compliance with applicable control regulations. Such terms and conditions may require that whenever deemed necessary by the division to assure such compliance the permittee shall: (a) Require pretreatment of efflu ent from industrial, governmental, or commercial facilities, processes, and activities befor e such effluent is received into the gathering and collection sy stem of the permittee; (b) Prohibit any connection to any municipal permittee' s interceptors and collection system that would result in receipt by such municipal permittee of any effluent other than sewag e required by law to be received by such permittee; (c) Include specified terms and conditions of its permit in all contracts for receipt by the permittee of any effluent not required to be received by a municipal permittee; (d) Initiate engineering and financial planning for expansion of the domestic wastewa ter treatment works whenever throug hput and treatment reaches eig hty percent of desig n capacity ; (e) Commence construction of such domestic wastewater treatment works expansion whenever throug hput and treatment reaches ninety -five percent of desig n capacity or, in the case of a municipality , either commence such construction or cease issuance of building permits within such municipality until such construction is commenced; except that building permits may continue to be issued for any construction which would not have the effect of increasing the input of domestic wastewater to the sewag e treatment works of the municipality involved. The term \"commence construction\" , as used in this paragraph (e), includes execution of, and commencement of work under, contract s for engineering design, plans, and specifications for erecti on, building , alteration, remodeling , improvement, or extension of treatment works and commitment to the completion of construction of such treatment works prior to exceeding permit effluent limitations based upon facility desig n and capacity or execution of a contract for the construction thereof. (6) Inclusion of the requirements authoriz ed by parag raph (d) of subsection (5) of this section shall be presumed unnecessary to assure compliance upon a showing that the area served by a dome stic wastewater treatment works has a stable or declining population; but this provision shall not be construed as preventing periodic review by the division should it be felt that g rowth is occurring or will occur in the area.

Permit required for point source water pollution control - definitions - housed commercial swine feeding operations - legislative declaration. (1) The people of the state of Colorado hereby find, determine, and declare that the advent of large housed commercial swine feeding operations in Colorado has presented new challeng es to ensuring that the quality of the state' s environment is preserved and protected. As disting uished from more traditional operations that historically have characterized Colorado' s livestock industry , large housed swine feeding operat ions use significant amounts of process water for flushing and disposing of swine waste, commonly store this waste in large impoundments, and dispose of it throug h land application. The waste storag e, handling and disposal by such operations are particularly odorous and offensive. The people further find that it is necessary to ensure that the storag e and land application of waste by housed commercial swine feeding operations is done in a responsible manner, so as not to adversely impact Colorado' s valuable air, land and water resources. (2) As used in this section, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (a) \"Agronomic rate of applicatio n\" means the rate of application of nutrients to plants that is necessary to satisfy the plants' nutritional requirements while strictly minimiz ing the amount of nutrients that run off to surface waters or which pass below the root zone of the plants, as specified by the most current published fertiliz er suggestions of the Colorado state university cooperative extension service for the plants, or most closely related plant type, to which the nutrients are applied. (b) \"Housed commercial swine feeding operation\" means a housed swine feeding operation that is capable of housing eight hundred thousand pounds or more of live animal weight of swine at any one time or is deemed a commercial operation under local zoning or land use regulations. Two or more housed swine confined feeding operations shall be considered to comprise a single housed commercial swine feeding operation if they are under common or affiliated ownership or manag ement, and are adjacent to or utilize a common area or system for manure disposal, are integ rated in any way, are located or discharg e within the same watershed or into water sheds that are hydrolog ically connected, or are located on or discharg e onto land overly ing the same g roundwater aquifer. (c) \"Housed swine feeding operation\" means the practice of raising swine in building s, or other enclosed structures wherein swine of any size are fed for forty -five days or longer in any twelve-month period, and crop or forage growth or production is not sustained in the area of confinement. (d) \"Process wastewater\" means any process-g enerated wastewater used in a housed comm ercial swine feeding operation, including water used for feeding , flushing , or washing , and any water or precipitation that comes into contact with any manure, urine, or any product used in or resulting from the production of swine. (3) No person shall operate, construct, or expand a housed commercial swine feeding operation without first having obtained an individual discharg e permit from the division. Page 670 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(4) On or before March 31, 1999, the commission shall promulg ate rules necessary to ensure the issuance and effective administration and enforcement of permits under this sectio n by July 1, 1999. Such rules shall incorporate the preceding subsection (3) and shall , at a minimum, require: (a) That the owner or operator of a housed commercial swine feeding operation must obtain division approval of construction, operations and swine waste management plans that, for any land waste application, includes a detailed agronomic analysis. Said plans shall employ the best availa ble waste manag ement practices, provide for remediation of residual soil and ground water contamination, and ensure that disposal of solid or liquid waste to the soil not exceed ag ronomic rates of application. (b) That appropriate setbacks for maintaining water quality be established for land waste application areas and waste impoundments; (c) That waste impoundments or manure stock piles shall not be located within a one- hundred-y ear floodplain unless proper flood proofing measures are desig ned and constructed; (d) That the owner or operator of the housed commercial swine feeding operation shall provide financial assurances for the final closure of the housed commercial swine feeding operation, the conduct of any necessary postclosure activities, the undertaking of any corrective action made necessary by migration of contaminants from the hous ed commercial swine feeding operation into the soil and g roundwater, or cleanup of any spill or breach; (e) That the owner or operator of a housed commercial swine feeding operation shall ensure that no solid or liquid waste generated by it shall be applied to land by any person at a rate that ex ceeds, in amount or duration, the ag ronomic rate of application; and (f) That, because waste storag e and disposal by housed commerci al swine feeding operations pose particular jeopardy for state trust lands, in light of the mandate in the Colorado constitution, article IX, section 10, that state land board trust lands be held in trust and be protected and enhan ced to promote long-term productivity and sound stewardship, the construction, operations and waste manag ement plans approved for housed commercial swine feeding operations on such lands, shall not permit the degradation of the physical attributes or value of any state trust lands. (5) Any spill or contamination by a housed commercial swine feeding operation shall be reported immediately to the division and the county or district public health agency for the county in which the housed commercial swine feeding operation is conducted , and, within twenty -four hours after the spill or contamination, a written report shall be filed with the division and the county or district public health agency for the county in which the housed commercial swine feeding operation is conducted. (6) Housed commercial swin e feeding operations shall submit to the division and the county or district public health agency quarterly, comprehensive monitoring reports and agronomic analy ses that demonstrate that the operation has land-applied solid and liquid waste at no greater than agronomic rates. The division shall require the sampling and monitor ing of chemical and appropriate biolog ical parameters to protect the quality and existing and future beneficial uses of groundwater including , at a minimum, nitrog en, phos phorus, heavy metals, and salts. At a minimum, the monitoring program shall include quarterly samples, analysis, and reporting of the groundwater, soils within the root zone, and soils beneath the root zone within each waste application site, and shall also include monitoring to ensure that no excessive seepag e occurs from any waste impoundments. Page 671 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(7) Repealed. (8) The division shall enforce the provisions of this section and shall take immediate enforcement action against any housed commercial swine feeding operation that has exceeded the agronomic rate limit of this section. In addition, any person who may be adversely affected by a housed commercial swine feeding operation may enforce these provisions directly against the operation by filing a civil action in the district court in the county in which the person resides. (9) These provisions shall not preclude any local government from imposing requirements more restrictive than those contained in this section.

(7) Repealed. (8) Where a permit requires treatment to levels necessary to protect water quality standards and beyond levels required by technolog y-based effluent limitation requirements, the division must determine whether or not any or all of the water-quality -standard-based effluent limitations are reasonably related to the economic, environmental, public health, and energ y impact to the public and affected persons, and are in furtherance of the policies set forth in sections 25-8-102 and 25-8-104. The division' s determination shall be based upon information available to it including information provided during the public comment period on the draft permit or in respons e to specific requests for information. Such determinations shall be included as a part of the written record of the issuance of the final permit, whether or not a variance is available under subsection (9) of this section to alter the water quality standard based effluent limitations. (9) The division may grant a variance from otherwise appli cable requirements only to the extent authorized in the federal act or implementing regulations.

The general assembly recog nizes that the proper and orderly regulation of in situ leach mining, as defined in section 34-32-103, C.R.S., for uranium ore has aspects that may involve more than one regulatory agency of state government and that the statutes that each agency is responsible for administering may, due to the use of terms of art and other technical words, phrases, and definitions, hold the potential of being interpreted inconsistently or to be held in conflict with each other. It is the intent of the general assembly that, with regard to in situ leach mining for uranium ore, the relevant agencies coordinate to the maximum extent practicable to resolve any such conflicts or inconsistencies.

This part 2 shall be known and may be cited as the \"State Hazardous W aste Siting Act\" section 1089, \u00a7 3, effective J une 3. 25-15-200.2. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds that adverse public health and envir onmental impacts can result from the improper land disposal of hazardous waste and that the need for establishing safe sites with adequate capacity for the disposal of hazardous waste is a matter of statewide concern, and the provisions of this part 2 are therefore enacted to provide an effective method of establishing such sites. (2) It is the intent of the general assembly that generators of hazardous waste be encourag ed to use on-site and off-site alternative treatment methods to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be discharg ed into the environment and the associated hazards to the health and welfare of the citizens of this state. Alternati ve management technolog ies which detox ify, stabiliz e, and reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be buried are available. For such purpose, the provisions of this part 2 are enacted to allow the development of safe alternative methods for the treatment of hazardous waste and to provide a means for the desig nation of hazardous waste disposal sites when such methods are unable to obviate the need for hazardous waste disposal on land. Whereas the state of Colorado may be responsible for the perpetual care of hazardous waste land disposal facilities, alternative technologies such as incineration, resource recovery , or physical, chemical, or biolog ical degradation should be implemented to the max imum ex tent possible.

The general assembly declares that it is in the public interest to ensure that environmental remediation projects protect human health and the environment. The general assembly finds that environmental remediation projects may leave residual contamination at levels that have been determined to be safe for a specific use, but not all uses, and may incorporate engineere d structures that must be maintained or protected against damag e to remain effective. The general assembly finds that in such cases, it is necessary to provide an effective and enforceable means of ensuring the conduct of any required maintenance, monitoring , or operation, and of restri cting future uses of the land, including placing restrictions on drilling for or pumping groundwater for as long as any residual contam ination remains hazardous. The general assembly , therefore, declares that it is in the public interest to creat e environmental covenants and notices of environmental use restrictions because such covenants and restrictive notic es are necessary for the protection of human health and the environment.

(1) An environ mental covenant shall be perpetual unless by its terms it is limited to a specific duration, unless the department approve s a request to terminate or modify it pursuant to section 25-15-319 (1)(h), or unless it is terminated by a court of comp etent jurisdiction. An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired throug h issuance of a tax deed or throug h advers e possession, nor may an environmental covenant be extinguished, limited, or impaired by reason of the doctrines of abandonment, waiver, lack of enforcement, or other common law principles relating to covenants, or by the ex ercise of eminent domain. (2) Notw ithstanding any other provision of law, including any common-law requirement for privity of estate, an environmental covenant shall run with the land and shall bind the owner of the land, the owner' s successors and assig ns, and any person using the land. An environmental covenant shall not be deemed unenforceable on the basis of: (a) A lack of privity of contract; (b) A lack of benefit to a particular parcel of land; (c) F ailure of the environmental covenant to ex pressly state that it runs with the land; or (d) Any other inconsistency with common-law requirements applicable to common-law covenants. (3) The requirements and restrictions of an environmental covenan t are requirements unde r this part 3 but may only be enforced as provided in section 25-15-322. The creation of an environmental covenant does not trig ger the application of any other requirement of this part 3. (4) The department shall not acquire any liability under state law by virtue of accepting an environmental covenant, nor shall any named benef iciary of an environmental covenant acquire any liability under state law by virtue of being such a beneficiary .

The owner of land subject to an environmental covenant or restrictive notice may request that the department approve modification or termination of the covenant or restrictive notice. The request shall contain information showing that the proposed modification or termination shall, if implemented, ensure protection of human health and the environment. The department shall review any submitted information and may request additional information.

(1) No environmental covenant shall be required for any environmental remediation project that results in residual contamination levels that have been determined by the relevant regulatory agency to be safe for all uses and that does not incorporate any engineered feature or structure or require any monitoring , maintenance, or operation. (2) Except as specified in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, an environmental covenant under this part 3 shall be required for any environmental remediation project in which the relevant regulatory authority makes a remedial decision on or after July 1, 2001, that would result in either or both of the following : (a) Residual conta mination at levels that have been determined to be safe for one or more specific uses, but not all uses; or (b) Incorporation of an engineered feature or structure that requires monitoring , maintenance, or operation or that will not function as intended if it is disturbed.

Such agreement shall be binding and mutually enforceable. The department shall have such authority as may be provided in the interg overnmental agreement to bring suit for injunctive relief to enforce any local ordinance or resolution described in this subsection (3), but only with respect to properties that are subject to the requirements of this section. Any interg overnmental agreement under this section shall require that, insofar as the local ordinance or resolution applies to properties that are subject to the requirements of this section, any amendments to the local ordinance or resolution shall Page 826 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutincorp orate such requirements as the department may recommend to ensure continued protection of human health and the environment. (4) (a) When an environmental covenant is required under subsection (2) of this section, a restrictive notice may be substituted for the covenant as follows: (I) An owner of a parcel of land involved in an environmental remediation project who is being required to remediate contamination may request that the department approve a proposed restrictive notice for such parcel or may request that the department issue a restrictive notice. (II) The department may unilaterally issue a restrictive notice containing the provisions described in section 25-15-319 when an environmental covenant is required under subsection (2) of this section and the owner of the subject property fails to create a covenant or restrictive notice within thirty days after: (A) The date of a remedial decision for an environmental remediati on project that relies solely on environmental use restrictions to protect human health and the environment; or (B) The completi on of construction work for environmental remediation projects that require phy sical work. (b) Prior to issuing a restrictive notice unilaterally under subparag raph (II) of paragraph (a) of this subsection (4), the department shall make a good-fait h attempt to reach agreement with the owner of the subject property regarding a consensual covenant or notice. (c) The department may not issue a restrictive notice for a parcel of land involved in an environmental remediation project that is owned by a person who is not being required to remediate the contamination, unless such person consents in writing . (5) The department may accept environmental covenants or issue restrictive notices in cases where such covenants or notices are not required, including approvals of voluntary cleanup plans or petitions for no action determinati ons under sections 25-16-306 and 25-16-307, but the owner of the remediated land nonetheless desires to create such a covenant or requests that the department issue such a notice.

(1) (a) The general assembly finds and declares that prescription drug misuse is a rampant problem in Colorado, in part due to the accidental and intentional abuse of leftover household medications. The general assembly further declares that citizen access to a disposal location to return unused household medications will reduce the availability of household medications for unintended or abusive purposes and will further protect the environment throug h proper disposal. (b) It is the intent of the general assembly to establish a household medication take-back program to facilitate the safe and effective collection and proper disposal of unused medications. (2) As used in this section: (a) \"Approved collection site\" means a site approved by the department for the collection of unused household medications. (b) \"Carrier\" means an entity approved by the department to transport unused household medications from approved collection sites to a disposal location. (c) \"Disposal location\" means a site approved by the department where unused household medications are destroy ed in compliance with applicable laws so that the household medications are in a nonretrievable state and cannot be diverted for illicit purposes. (d) \"Household medications\" means controlled substances approved for collect ion by federal law, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter medications in the possession of an individual. (3) Subject to available funds, the executive director of the department shall establish a househo ld medication take-back program to collect and dispose of unused household medications. The program must allow for individuals to dispose of unused household medicatio ns at approved collection sites and for carriers to transport unused household medications from approved collection sites to disposal locations. (4) A collection site, carrier, or disposal location is not subject to liability for incidents arising from the collection, transport, or disposal of household medications if the collection site, carrier, or disposal location complies with the household medication take-back program in good faith and does not violate any applicable laws. Page 831 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(5) The household medication take-back cash fund is created in the state treasury for the direct and indirect costs associated with the implementation of this section. The fund consists of money s appropriated or transferred to the fund by the general assembl y and any gifts, grants, and donations from any public or private entity . The departmen t shall transmit gifts, grants, and donations collected by the department to the state treasurer, who shall credit the money s to the fund. The money s in the fund are subject to annual appropriation by the g eneral assembly .

(1) The general assembly hereby finds that there is a need for more clarity and uniformity regarding the definition of infectious waste and in the requirements for the handling , treatment, and disposal thereof and that the absence of such clarit y and the inappropriate desig nation of general waste as infectious waste will result in further substantial and unnecessary costs, disparity , and confusion in the manag ement of infectious waste, ultimately affecting many busin ess and residential operations and facilities, including the operations and quality of care rendered by health care providers. (2) For the purposes set forth in subsectio n (1) of this section, the provisions of this part 4 are enacted as a matter of statewide concern. The provisi ons of this part 4 shall not apply to infectious waste which is also deemed to be hazardous waste pursuant to section 25-15- 101 (6), nor shall infectious waste be deemed hazardous waste solely because it is characteriz ed as infectious waste. (3) The general assembly further finds that, because of the nature of infectious waste and the manner of its desig nation as provided in this part 4 and because this part 4 recommends portions of the guidelines of the United States environmental protection agency, no rules or regulations governing the generators of infectious waste are necessary for nor shall be applicable to the implementation of this part 4. This limitation shall not be construed to limit any other rule- making which is permitted under other authoriz ing statutes. Source: L. 89: Entire part added, p. 1175, \u00a7 1, effective April 23.

(1) For the purposes of this part 4 and statewide applicability : (a) \"Infectious waste\" means waste capable of producing an infectious disease and requires the considerati on of certain factors necessary for induction of disease. These factors include: (I) Presence of a pathog en of sufficient virulence; (II) Dose; (III) Portal of entry ; (IV) Resistance of host. (b) For a waste to be infectious, it must contain pathog ens with sufficient virulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible host could result in disease. All the factors specified in parag raph (a) of this subsection (1) must be present simultaneously for disease transmission to occur and must be present in a manner which constitutes a substantial risk of infection to humans. (2) (a) Infectious waste shall be desig nated as such by the generator in accordance with this part 4. Such desig nation shall not be based solely upon any source or type of waste but shall be based upon the factors specified in subsection (1) of this section. (b) It is recommended by the general assembl y that the following categ ories of waste, as published in the \"EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management\", May 1986, by the United States environmental protection ag ency, be desig nated as infectious: (I) Isolation wastes from persons diagnosed as having a disease caused by an organism requiring , pursuant to recommendations by the centers for disease control in the 1988 publication \"Biosafety in the Microbiolog ical and Biomedical Laboratory \" (second edition), biosafety level I V containment; (II) Cultures and stocks of infectious ag ents and associated biolog icals; (III) Human blood and blood products and body fluids consisting of serum, plasma and other blood components, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid; (IV) Human patholog ical/anatomical waste consisting of tissues and body parts that are discarded from surg ical, obstetrical, autopsy , and laboratory procedures; (V) Contaminated sharps; (VI) Contaminated laboratory or research animal carcasses, body parts, and bedding .

Legislative declaration. (1) The g eneral assembly hereby finds that: (a) The state operates or state agencies provide funding for a wide variety of prevention, intervention, and treatment programs desig ned to assist youth in achievin g an education, in making informed choices about their health and well-being , in avoiding the juvenile and criminal justice systems, and, generally, in becoming healthy , law-abiding , contributing members of society ; (b) These prevention, intervention, and treatment programs are operated by or funded through several departments within the executive branch, and this high degree of decentraliz ation often makes communications between and among these departments and programs difficult; (c) There is some overlap among prevention, intervention, and treatment programs, sometimes resulting in the potentially inefficient use of state resources which may result in the provision of fewer services to y outh; (d) The dispersion of prevention, intervention, and treatment programs among state departments makes it difficult for both state employ ees and the public to determine what programs are availabl e and what services are provided throug h prevention, intervention, and treatment prog rams that are operated by or funded throug h state ag encies; (e) The term limitations placed on persons who serve in public office, including members of the general assembly , make it increasing ly important that information concerning the existence, funding , and opera tion of prevention, intervention, and treatment programs for youth be readily accessible; (f) In the area of prevention, intervention, and treatment services, there is a critical need for local and state programs to overcome barriers and the categ orical requirements of various funding sources in order to design and implement programs that provide a more comprehensive response to the needs of Colorado y outh; (g) Research demonstrates that program coordination among multi ple systems for the purpose of improving prevention, intervention, and treatment services results in significant positive outcomes; (h) A unified, coordinated response to community -based programs for the delivery of prevention, intervention, and treatment services has proven to be an effective and efficien t state response to local prog rams and their needs. (2) The general assembly therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the youth and families of the state to create a single division in the department of public health and environment to operate prevention and intervention programs and to oversee the provision of prevention, intervention, and treatment services throug h federally and state-funded prevention, intervention, and treatment programs to ensure colla boration among programs and the availability of a continuum of services for y outh.

(1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) Statewide, students miss seven million eight hundred thousand school hours each year due to oral pain. Nationwide, workers miss one hundred sixty-four million work hours each year due to dental issues. (b) Forty percent of children in kindergarten and fifty-five percent of children in third grade have a history of dental decay . (c) Children in low-income schools have twice as much untreated tooth decay and are twice as likely to have a history of cavities than children who are not in low-income schools. (d) Among children, ninety percent of dental decay is in the pits and fissures of posterior permanent teeth. (e) Children who have received dental sealants in a school-based program have, for a period of up to five years, sixty percent fewer new decay ed pit and fissure surfaces in their posterior permanent teeth than children who have not received an application of dental sealants. Page 926 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(f) Fluoride is nature' s cavity fighter. Fluoride occurs naturally in almos t all water sources. Since 1948, scientific research has shown that community water fluorid ation can reduce the incidence of dental cavities. (g) Community water fluoridation is the process of adjusting the level of fluoride found naturally in water to a level recommended to protect against dental decay . The centers for disease control named community water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century . (h) Water fluoridation is safe and provides the most cost- effective means to prevent tooth decay for persons of all ag es and socioeconomic backg rounds. (i) Water fluoridation is one of the most researched and cost-effective oral health interventions available, as the averag e cost of one dental filling can fund a lifetime of fluoridatio n, which is known to prevent eighteen to forty percent of cavities in both children and adults. (2) The general assembly further finds that improving access to oral health care service s and fluoridated water for all Coloradans, particularly low-income Coloradans, will reduce the burden of oral disease. Therefore, the Colorado oral health program dedicates itself to improving access to oral health care services by working with community stakeholders, professional organizations, and direct recipients of oral health care to remove barriers to access to oral health care. (3) The purpose of this article is to promote the public health and welfare of Coloradans by providing a grant prog ram to: (a) Provide oral health services, including sealants, to school children; and (b) Assist communities in attaining optimal levels of fluoride in drinking water provided by community water sy stems as a means of preventing dental decay .

(2) Subject to criteria that the department may establish, including the types of providers to whom the department may award grants, the department shall award grants in the following categ ories: (a) Oral health services that target children who are eligible for free and reduced-price lunches under the \"Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act\", 42 U.S.C. sec. 1751 et seq., or who attend school in a school district whose median household income is at or below two hundre d thirty -five percent of the federal poverty line.

(b) F luoridation support services, including : (I) Assistance in the desig n, purchase, installation, maintenance, and inspection of equipment desig ned to add fluoride to drinking water to achieve optimal levels for the prevention of tooth decay , as determined by the federal department of health and human services; (II) Training of water treatment personnel in the proper operation of fluor idation equipment and current water fluoridation practices; and (III) Monitoring of fluoride content by obtaining mont hly samples of finished drinking water to assure the optimal level of fluoride to prevent dental decay .

ARTICLE 23 Dental L oan Repay ment Prog ram 25-23-101. Legislative declaration. (1) The g eneral assembly hereby finds that: (a) Many dental professionals, particularly dentists, graduate with large debt levels that were used to finance their professional education; (b) Dentistry is provided predominantly through individual practices, which minimiz es the opportunity for dental professionals to provide unreimbursed services while maintaining the costs of a practice and repay ing their educational loans; (c) Many Colorado communities encounter difficulty recruiting dental providers dedicated to serving underserved populations; (d) Incentives to reduce the indebtedness of dental professionals will increase access to dental care for underserved populations. (2) The general assembly also finds that, during the 2000 regular session, the general assembly expanded the children' s basic health plan to include dental services and paid for such expansion out of the tobacco settlement money s, but, due to a lack of dental providers, the inclusion of dental care services was made conting ent upon an adequate number of dental providers being willing to provide services. The general assembly hereby finds that the loan repay ment program created in this article would provide a method to develop the infrastructure and resources needed to provide dental services as part of the children' s basic health plan. (3) The general assembly , therefore, states that the purpose of this article is to encourage and enable dental professionals to provide care throug h the children' s basic health plan and the Page 929 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutmedicaid program and to other underserved populations in Colorado by the use of a financial incentive prog ram.

Additionally , the general assembly finds that the department should explore whether risk-based inspections may be Page 952 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printoutimplemented to allocate resources more effectively and at the same time adequately protect the health and safety of the residents.

Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembl y hereby finds, determines, and declares that: (a) Health care entities have instituted or are instituting quantitative and qualitative desig nations of phy sicians and dentists; (b) Physician and dentist desig nations are disclosed and represent ed to consumers and others as part of marketing , sales, and other efforts, and such desig nations may be used by consumers in selecting the phy sicians and dentists from whom they receive care; (c) Designations are based on claims data, practice criteria or guidelines, and other criteria, not all of which are made known to consumers or to the physicians and dentists desig nated; (d) Health care entities differ in the extent to which they provide access to some or all of the data, criteria, and methodolog ies; (e) Regulatory agencies in other states have taken action against health care entities to require disclosure of desig nation information and to set certain criteria by which desig nations may be used; (f) For the protection of consumers, physicians, and dentists and to avoid improper profiling of physicians and dentists, health care entities must ensure that they are using desig nations that are fair and accurate and must accord physicians and dentists the right to challeng e and correct erroneous desig nations, data, and methodolog ies; (g) Full disclosure of the data and methodolog ies by which physicians and dentists are desig nated will encourag e, to the fullest extent possible, the accuracy , fairness, and usefulness of such desig nations. Disclosures will help keep patients from being exposed to inaccurate, misleading , and incorrect information about the nature and quality of the care of physicians and dentists. The disclosure required by this article will encourag e the use of guidelines and criteria from well-recog nized profession al societies and groups using evidence-based and consensus practice recommendations. Disclo sure will allow health care consumers and physicians and dentists an opportunity to better understand the criteri a, basis, and methods by which physicians and dentists are evaluated, and disclo sure will foster competition among health care entities to improve the way in which designations are used. According ly, the general assembly finds that requiring full disclosure of designation data and methodolog ies and setting certain minimum standard s for making such desig nations will help improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivered in Colorado. Page 1005 of 1048 Colorado Revised Statutes 2018 Uncertified Printout(h) The general assembly intends this article to serve as the initial stage of a multipart process to increase transparency of information about health care quality and costs in Colorado. Future actions may include, but are not limited to, creation of a multistakeholder work group, comprised of health care entities, health plans, businesses, consumer groups, and others as identified, to develop a system for aggregating cost and quality information across health care entities and consumers. The ultimate goal is to develop standar dized quality reporting arrang ements, consistent with national standards and subject to evaluation by an independent entity , that are accessible and meaning ful to consumers and other stakeholders.
