Loving the cycles of the seasons, Ruth watches the moon and never misses a solstice or equinox turning. Ruth is a Mesa Carrier on the Peruvian Medicine Path, and has completed her work to become a \"Pampamesayog.\" The training involves personal healing, transformational healing for others, and creating ceremony and ritual for ourselves and for the earth. Ruth has also studied other indigenous belief systems. In 2018, she had the opportunity to travel to Ecuador for a Shaman Summit with the Yachaks of the Andes. There she experienced a powerful LaLimpia healing, and has since completed training to be able to offer that sacred method of healing. Here is Ruth's statement on faith: \"I have always strived to live as a person with faith. After serving for several years as a Christian pastor, I took my leave of traditional patriarchal systems of belief. My faith found its way to indigenous belief systems, and an honoring of the earth as sacred. This interconnectedness is what nourishes my spirit.\" Services From spiritual ceremonies, to workshops, to healing sessions, Ruth is available to serve your healing and growth.

As Ruth carried out the clearing using a variety of natural materials, I felt the heaviness I have been carrying dissipate. After a week, I'm still feeling lighter and noticing that I am reacting differently to certain situations.\" \u2014 KS \"Ruth's passion and creativity for ritual stops the chaos that can consume our lives.
