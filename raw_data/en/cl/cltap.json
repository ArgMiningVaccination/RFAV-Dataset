Doug Ralph: Born 1948 \"Doug wasn't scared of labels. He gave his religion as Bush Baptist.\" When Doug retired from the Friends of the Box-Ironbark Forest committee, he was rightly described by Marie Jones as an \"Elder of the environment movement\". Doug was the founding president of the group, formed in the late 1990s by people in the community of Castlemaine interested in working towards highlighting the significance of the Box-Ironbark forests and woodlands. He knew this country better than anyone else, and was generous in sharing his knowledge of it; hundreds of people have been introduced to its secrets on the guided walks he ran for many years, or via the contributions he made in innumerable forums. Doug was tireless in his efforts to get better management for our natural heritage, but he was also insatiable in his curiosity about cultural history. Although he was sceptical about the value of gold mining, and relentlessly critical of its destructive effect on the environment, he had enormous sympathy for the miners and huge interest in the detail of their lives. One of Doug's most striking qualities was his inclusiveness. He kept his eye on the important issues, and was impatient of efforts to divide this community into 'old' and 'new' residents. What counted for him was getting things right, not where someone came from. A fifth generation local, he welcomed anyone who had something to offer the community. Doug wasn't scared of labels. He had a terrific sense of irony, but wasn't ashamed to put himself on the line: 'I'm a tree hugger. I'm proud of it.' He gave as his religion, Bush Baptist. There was no one like him. \u2014 by Bernard Slattery, on behalf of the Friends of the Box-Ironbark Forest Elsie Lynette Martin: Born 2011 \"Boats, planes, trains, cars. If it had an engine and it went fast, Elsie was on board.\" Boats, planes, trains, cars... If it had an engine and it went fast, Elsie was on board. Every mode of transport fascinated her and every destination was an adventure. \"I love planes, Mummy,\" she once mused. \"Where are we going next?\" In Darwin, we took a tour bus that converted to a boat as it descended a ramp into the harbour. \"Watch out the water! Watch out the water!\" Elsie screamed and when she realised we were not only floating, we were moving forward her big eyes grew even rounder in disbelief and delight. She waved to every person on Mitchell Street from the back of the bus that day, thrilled that so many people returned the gesture. On a train trip from Adelaide, we bought Elsie a disposable camera and after figuring out where the button was she said: \"I like this world; I'm going to take a photo of it.\" By the time Elsie was three and a half years old she'd travelled to every state and territory in Australia, except WA. Fond of singing John Williamson songs on family car trips, Elsie could often be heard belting out: \"you've gotta go that way, there's nearly half Australia over there in WA.\" Sadly, we never managed to get there. Elsie passed away in July after an 11-month battle with childhood cancer. \u2014 by Jill Martin Lorna Wilson: Born 1928 \"She held on to say her last goodbye. She was always stubborn. And strong.\" We had always lived in different towns, and while I was a kid I only visited my great grandmother during family holidays. Then adulthood hit and those gaps lengthened as uni, job and life took over. At the beginning of the year on the spur of the moment I took a weekend off and drove myself, my boyfriend and my dog back down to see her. More recently, she took a turn for the worse and was placed in palliative care. I went with my grandma, mum, brother and uncle to go see her. Just be with her. It was a weird time. An odd group of people banding together from all across WA. Family. We talked, and told her about what was going on in our lives, in the world, with the weather, with the patients next door. She loved gossip. Photos were in every corner of her room \u2014 of her parents, husband, children, grandchildren and her great grandchildren. And slowly stories came out... She used to make amazing roast dinners for the family, but everyone was only allowed two potatoes to make sure it all went around. She had helped save her neighbour because of her stubborn habit to stay up late and watch TV. He had fallen over in the garden and, as she looked out the window, she saw him struggling. She would take her girls shopping once a year for a special dress, and they would wear it to every dance, party and wedding during that year. But then we had to say goodbye. Go back home. She seemed happy though, content at least. Her other daughter managed to fly in early the next morning. Arrived and talked with her, hugged her and kissed her. Just loved her, and it was then she passed away. She held on to say her last goodbye. She was always stubborn. And strong. I will miss her. We will miss her. \u2014 by Saffy Brenda Lee Kealy: Born 1959 \"She would pull you in, spin you around and dance her heart out to the music she loved.\" The last time I remember having a good dance with mum was almost a year ago, at her brother's wedding. Whenever one of her favourite songs played, she would not only dance whole-heartedly, but rope others in to dance with her (whether they wanted to or not!). Some of her favourite songs to dance to included, Time Warp, Ballroom Blitz, White Wedding, anything by Queen or Skyhooks, Whip It or My Sharona, just to name a few. Mum had great taste! She would pull you in, spin you around and dance her heart out to the music she loved. I always remember mum saying that music and dancing is what makes a great party. I can still picture her dancing, with a huge smile on her face, loving life! I'll always remember her this way. \u2014 by Georgia Kealy Jett Jeremiah Monika: Born 2015 \"A spirited little fighter born three months prematurely inspired courage and the love of many.\" Jett was born in the black of night, in the early hours of Easter Sunday, 2015. The sun then rose to a bright blue sky day and with it, so much hope that we could help him get to safe passage. So the challenging roller coaster ride began \u2014 the wins and the setbacks, the heartache, the tears and the prayers, but with time we watched Jett grow and start showing us all the signs that he was OK. This photo was taken in a quiet and deeply connected moment with his mum, during a one-on-one conversation which included declarations of love, promises of forever, and gratitude for all that we had. Jett had been with us five months, his big brown eyes sparkled with curiosity for everything around him. His feisty character was stronger than ever and his cheeky smile so delightful that he captivated everyone who met him. We were blessed to have Jett for a further six weeks, before his battle became too difficult and we had to say our devastating goodbyes. We love to remember Jett as he is in this photo. He brought us so much joy in his short time with us, he taught us so many lessons about what is truly important in this life. We will love you forever Jett, you are our inspiration and we are so fiercely proud of You XXX. Mum, Dad, and big Sister Ruby \u2014 by Lauren O'Sullivan Richie Benaud: Born 1930 \"If cricket had ever anointed a pope, it would be Richie Benaud.\" So said Jim Maxwell of cricket icon [Richie Benaud, the voice of summer, the king of cricket commentators, who died on April 10](/news/2015-04-10/richie-benaud-dead/6009202). Benaud first donned the Baggy Green in January 1952 against the West Indies and distinguished himself as a first-rate leg-spinning all-rounder. Over the next 12 years, he played 63 Tests for Australia and was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 wickets. He never lost a series as Australian captain. Born in Penrith, the son of leg-spinner, cricket literally was in Benaud's blood. His father took the 10-year-old Richie to his first cricket game at the SCG in 1940 - a Sheffield Shield match featuring Don Bradman. It was his dad who taught the future Australian cricket captain how to bowl googlies, leg-breaks and top-spinners and by age 16, the younger Benaud was showing great promise as an all-rounder. He really came into his own as captain of the Australian cricket team, a position he took against England in 1958. Not only did his attacking flair get the team results, it also captured the imagination of fans jaded with Test cricket and set a precedent for modern cricket. But it was Benaud's voice, filtering into lounge rooms and across sun-drenched beaches and parks from TV sets and transistor radios, which really captured the nation. His calm, mellow and professional commentary, together with his fashion sense, spawned countless comedy routines and a fan club, The Richies. Benaud initially began his media career with pen and notepad in 1956 at the Sydney Sun newspaper after convincing the editor to give him a job. It was here that he developed an economy of words which became a feature of his career. Once launched as a journalist, it did not take Benaud long to move into sports writing and then broadcast journalism, after a training stint with the BBC following the 1956 Ashes tour. In 1967, Benaud married Daphne Surfleet, a writer of note and the first woman in Lord's press gallery. The couple moved back to Australia and began a sports consultancy business. He was presented with an OBE in 1961 for services to cricket and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Ken Clifford: Born 1942 \"He loved to watch his young charges move up the sporting ladder.\" \"Watch the joy on their faces,\" Ken Clifford told me before the presentation. \"That's what this job is all about.\" As a former chairman of Hunter Academy of Sport, I was fortunate enough to visit a number of country schools with Ken over his 26 years as CEO. One trip that sticks in my mind was a visit to the tiny Mitchells Island primary school on the Manning River to give out awards to a relay team of two boys and two girls who won a State title. The reaction from the kids and their sense of achievement was the motivation for Ken. He loved to watch his young charges move up the sporting ladder and celebrated with them when they reached Regional, State and National representative honours. But more importantly, he loved to watch them become better citizens. Two who come to mind who were very close to Ken \u2014 sailor Nathan Outteridge and discus thrower Ben Harradine, are still at the top of the sporting tree. Nathan won Olympic gold in London sailing the 49ers with Iain Jensen and is also a World Champion in that class. But without Ken's help, he might never have made it. Ken learnt about sport the hard way \u2014 on the field or on the court. He played cricket, basketball, hockey, rugby, soccer, tennis, Australian Rules and squash. Cricket and basketball were his two greatest loves. He was an excellent fast bowler and at school, represented at State level and later, at District level. He later turned to basketball refereeing and quickly became one of the best in Australia. He was rated the number one basketball referee in NSW from 1976 to 1986. But it was as an administrator that he made his mark in the Hunter Region, putting back into sport much more than he took out. \u2014 by Vic Levi Judy Cassab: Born 1920 \"It was an all consuming passion she had. She was completely obsessed with being an artist.\" Prolific portrait painter, Judy Cassab was the first woman to win the prestigious Archibald Prize twice, in 1960 and again in 1967. Famous Australians such as Joan Sutherland, Margaret Whitlam, John Olsen and Margaret Fink sat for her, and her work is exhibited in galleries throughout the country. But life was not always so rosy for Judit Kaszab, the daughter of Hungarian Jewish parents who grew up in Central Europe as World War II took hold. Cassab first became aware of her talent for art after her mother gave her a box of crayons for her 12th birthday and she promptly drew a portrait of her grandmother, which still exists today. In 1938 Cassab captured the heart of a much older man, Jancsi Kampfner and after being assured by him she could continue with her art, they married. However, as German troops arrived, the pair was separated, and Cassab assumed the identity of her German maid to avoid capture by Nazis. After the war, she and her husband learned their immediate families had died in concentration camps. In 1951, with two young sons, the couple moved to Australia, initially settling in a Bondi boarding house with other Hungarian immigrants. Throughout these times, Cassab continued to pain with encouragement from her husband, and she befriended artists. With her talent, beauty and avant-garde European style, Cassab soon became a darling of the Sydney art scene and quickly developed a reputation for her portraiture. \"You have to keep in mind that in the early days, women were looked down on in the art world, they weren't generally accepted,\" her son Peter Kampfner said. He said his mother was consumed with art and with being an artist. According to Art Gallery of NSW curator Anne Ryan, Cassab's greatest legacy was in the way she captured the important figures of the day. Cassab is less well-known for her landscape studies, water colours and drawings, and paintings of the Australian bush. After her first visit to central Australia in 1959, she would refer to it as her \"spiritual home\". She was awarded many accolades and art prizes and in 1980, became only the second female Art Gallery of NSW trustee. [Judy Cassab died on November 3](/news/2015-11-03/acclaimed-portrait-painter-judy-cassab-dies-aged-95/6909614) and is survived by her sons Peter and John and their families. Nick Greening: Born 1967 \"Little brother, what happened? Why did you go so early?\" Sadly, Nick collapsed in Foley Park on Glebe Point Road one Monday morning in May earlier this year, having smoked some synthetic marijuana he had bought from the tobacco shop over the road. He was 47, hadn't been looking after himself, but he still had a full time job. Strangely, a German paramedic was close by and performed enough CPR that Nick was revived and taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He lasted another five days before we were convinced to turn off life support. He died on May 16. We are taking him to Auckland in a couple of weeks to bury him with our mother. RIP Nick xxx \u2014 by Lynda Mark William Tomkinson: Born 1967 \"I buried you on our wedding anniversary... Your life was lived large, extinguished in a moment.\" The moment you boarded the small alpine train headed for the higher slopes, I could sense your building anticipation. I knew the glistening snow was your very favourite thing on earth, and not only were we in the middle of a blizzard, but today we were venturing even higher, into the Alps of Switzerland. No skiing today, the visibility is too low, so today we are adventurers! We will travel to Grindelwald and explore this quaint village, find cosy taverns to eat, drink and laugh in, and will trek across, up and down for that elusive \"best shot\" across the region. Our whole lives together had been lived as one adventure after another. It's how you were when we first met, and how I came to be. You must have experienced pain that day; those undiagnosed \"episodes\", which ultimately took you, had visited the night previous. But there was no sign from you. Just that insatiable desire to soak up life, and a smile that made my soul happy. As our train wound slowly up the side of the majestic Jungfrau, I remember you were stunned by the frozen landscape that continued around every bend. Yes, you'd seen snow many times, but not like this, this silent, black and white panorama took your breath away. I cherish the photos you took whilst we made our way up that rickety climb. I can still picture the little caf\u00e9 we found in Grindelwald. Instead of cosying up inside near the fire, you wanted to sit outside, nearest the snow, whilst we laughed and drank our Gl\u00fchwein. You were simply... happy. And so I took this photo, the last time you would see snow.... Your face says it all. How you loved that moment, how you loved life... and how you loved me. \u2014 by Deborah Hunter Lottie Wright: Born 1923 \"Lottie was a live-wire, adored by her family. She had a love of fun, pinkness and champagne.\" Lottie was an extraordinary lady. I didn't meet her until she was in her early 80s, and she was a live-wire then, so I can only imagine what she was like when she was younger. She remained a bundle of energy the entire time I knew her. She was the much-loved matriarch of close family friends, and we felt like part of her family as well. Lottie always made me feel special; one of those marvellous people who paid complete attention to whomever she was speaking with, making them feel the centre of her world for that moment. I never saw Lottie without a smile on her face, and pink in her hair. She had a penchant for pink clothing too, and was always beautifully dressed and brightly coiffed. I attended her 90th birthday, with much champagne and festivity. It was a celebration of the nine decades of an exceptional daughter, wife, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother and great grandmother. This photo represents the way I remember her, champagne at hand, pink in her hair, and a smile on her face. Even in her 90s, Lottie still lived at home, and was happy and healthy until near the end \u2014 and even then, I bet she passed with a smile on her face. Her coffin was fluorescent pink. After the funeral service, the great-grandchildren were presented with white envelopes containing butterflies that they released one by one. Most of the butterflies flew away, but one stayed, and the smaller children passed it from one to the other, until finally one gently placed it onto the leaf of a tree. It seemed to me that the butterfly was Lottie's spirit saying goodbye to her little ones, and in return, they each said goodbye and released her to be free from this life. \u2014 by Robin Lonsdale Johnny Japangardi Miller \"It was a rough time. Kardiya (white people) in the old days were really hard.\" Walpiri man Johnny \"Hooker Creek\" Japangardi Miller was the [senior traditional owner for Mt Theo](http://mttheo.org/home/), 450 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs. He dedicated much of the latter part of his life to caring for and rehabilitating young Indigenous petrol-sniffers in his country. Japangardi's nickname, Hooker Creek, came about as a result of the role he played in establishing the settlement of the same name, now known as Lajamanu community. He was born near Yuendumu, in the Northern Territory and his early life was a traditional nomadic Walpiri life, travelling between water holes with parents he was in awe of for their deep affinity with the land. About 1928, at the time of the Coniston Massacre, Japangardi saw his first white man, or Kardiya, while hiding in the hills of Mt Theo. The police were rounding up the Walpiri people and shooting them, so his family was singing up country to protect them from bullets. Japangardi's stories revolved around his work as a stockman on cattle stations in Central Australia, including at Wave Hill and Adelaide River in the Top End. He was known as a hard worker but also, a \"lover boy\", two characteristics which saw him sent away in \"a big red government truck\" to Hooker Creek in 1953. There, he worked building stockyards and an airstrip, doing stockwork and working from dawn to dusk in the blazing sun, in fear of his employers who would \"give us hiding with whip or green sticks\". During World War II, he drove army trucks. About 20 years ago, Japangardi decided to return to return to country at Mount Theo where his four brothers and their families lived. At the time, petrol sniffing was rife among communities in Central Australia and Japangardi's sister-in-law Peggy Brown suggested the family should care for the petrol sniffers within their community. From little things, big things grow and the Mt Theo program was born. Over the years, Japangardi became the primary care taker for the young petrol sniffers who regarded him with respect, while listening to his stories of the dreamtime and his life as a stockman. Yuendumu is now free of petrol sniffing. Japangardi was awarded the Order of Australia medal in 2007. Up until his death, aged about 80 and almost blind, he was still taking young people on bush trips, encouraging them to learn more about their country and culture. Christine Greiner: Born 1961 \"We will never forget our last memory of Chris in her white bikini.\" In March 2014 I had a weekend at the beach with some old school friends. Christine is on the right of the photo and I am on the left. On the way to the beach, I mentioned that I had never been skinny dipping so the girls said they had to rectify this over the weekend. So late one night, after a few drinks, we all donned towels or sarongs and snuck down to the beach, giggling like silly school girls. It was a moonlit night when we slipped off our gear and tip-toed in the waves. We noticed that our friend Christine, who was very tanned, looked like she was wearing a white bikini. Just three months after this fun weekend all together, our dear friend Christine was diagnosed with a brain tumour and lost her battle at the beginning of 2015. We will never forget our last memory of Chris in her white bikini. \u2014 by Robyn Terry Pratchett: Born 1948 \"I would like to die peacefully with Thomas Tallis on my iPod before the disease takes me over.\" It was no secret British author of the Discword series, Terry Pratchett, loved the music of 16th century composer Thomas Tallis. He also campaigned passionately for the legalisation of assisted death, after being diagnosed in 2007 with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a progressive degenerative condition. Pratchett's fantasy novels sold in their tens of millions worldwide, generating a huge fan base of readers who expressed their dismay at his death via social media. \"People are petitioning Death to bring back Terry Pratchett. I think he would have loved this one,\" tweeted Felicity Morse. \"'It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.' RIP the brilliant Terry Pratchett,\" Ricky Gervais tweeted. Pratchett, known for his trademark broad-brimmed black hat \"fired the imagination of millions,\" British prime minister David Cameron said. The 41-book Discworld series was based on a circular world set on the backs of four elephants standing on the shell of a giant turtle, populated by a vast and colourful cast of characters. Pratchett used the series to parody aspects of modern life by drawing often incongruous connections between his imaginary world and things ordinary people living in 20th-century Britain would recognise. He was an only child, born in Buckinghamshire, UK who, encouraged by his father, engaged in the usual activities boys liked, but he attributed his love of books to his grandmother. By his own admission, he was a \"nondescript\" student, preferring woodwork to Latin. His first story was published in the school magazine when he was 13 and two years later, he sold the story and used the proceed to buy his first typewriter. He developed an interest in astronomy early but, lacking an aptitude for maths, turned to science fiction for his \"fix\". After leaving school, he worked as a journalist and published his first book, The Carpet People, in 1971. His first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983. Pratchett was also a fan of carnivorous plants and once built and observatory in his garden. He was diagnosed with the rare form of Alzheimer's disease, PCA, in 2007 and became a champion for a person's right to die on their terms. Pratchett was awarded an OBE in 1998 for his services to literature and in 2009, was knighted. In the end, [he died peacefully at home on March 12](/news/2015-03-13/terry-pratchett-author-of-fantasy-discworld-novels-dies-at-66/6312048) , his cat on his bed and possibly with Thomas Tallis on his iPod. He is survived by his wife of almost 45 years Lyn Purves and his daughter. Sam de Brito: Born 1969 \"In a crowded field where most prove one-trick ponies, [he] stood out as a thoroughbred.\" He was so admired and respected for his writing and the way he tackled issues of modern life that a huge outpouring of grief overcame social media on the news of [Sam de Brito's unexpected death on October 12](/news/2015-10-12/sam-de-brito-dies/6846834). The writer and Fairfax columnist, single dad and author managed to tap into the nation's psyche. He was the first to write about men's issues, inciting controversy and outrage in what [the Sydney Morning Herald obituary described as](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/sam-de-brito-writer-tapped-into-the-male-pulse-20151015-gkam0j.html) \"a mixture of bravado, bulldust, embedded journalism and astute observations\". \"In a crowded field where most prove one-trick ponies, Sam de Brito stood out as a thoroughbred,\" the Herald wrote. His regular column, All Men Are Liars, was published in the Sun Herald and The Sunday Age on weekends. De Brito wrote on all manner of issues and over the years, began to share themes of mental health, solo parenting and animal welfare. Born in Sydney into a family of journalists, he spent his early years immersed in a blended family of creative people, surrounded by books and ideas. His first job out of school was as a copy kid with News Limited, followed by a cadetship. From there he conquered New York, working on a showbiz publication. De Brito's bravado and fearless escapades to get the story attracted attention back home, but he figured any publicity was good publicity. He also wrote five books, including No Tattoos Before You're Thirty and The Lost Boys, and turned his hand to television, script writing for Stingers and Water Rats. In the many tributes to the larrikin writer, words like \"honest\", \"decent\", \"fiercely intelligent\" and \"loved\" regularly came up. Many of de Brito's friends and colleagues would say his greatest accomplishment and pride was his young daughter Anoushka, with whom he shared custody with former partner, Janneke Thurlow. Isobel Varley: Born 1937 \"It was like a drug, tattooing, for her; she went right down to her feet.\" The retired secretary and mother of one, Isobel Varley, got her first tattoo \u2014 a small bird on her shoulder \u2014 after attending a tattoo convention. By her own admission, she soon became addicted and followed up with an orchid on her thigh. Varley had battled Alzheimer's disease and at the time of her death on May 21, she had more than 200 tattoos and had spent more than 500 hours of her life in the tattoo parlour. Tattoos covered 93 per cent of her body and her favourite was a family of tigers on her stomach. She also had more than 50 piercings. Varley was named by Guiness World Records as the \"Most Tattooed Senior Citizen (female)\". Her husband Malcolm, who survives her, [told the UK's Hertfordshire Mercury ](http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Isobel-Varley-world-s-tattooed-senior-citizen/story-26495311-detail/story.html#1)that his wife had been described as \"a legend of tattooing\" and she would be remembered for that, and \"because of her laugh\". \"In fact, one guy approached and said, 'Can I use your laugh as a ring tone?'\" Malcolm said. Varley never set out to break a world record but found fame touring the world, displaying her body. She also appeared in magazines and advertisements. \"She never planned it, it just happened. She never had it in her mind,\" Malcolm said. \"It was a like a drug, tattooing, for her, she went right down to her feet. She was always able to carry it off.\" Her last tattoo was three years ago, after her husband noticed her pain threshold had dropped. \"I was so impressed by the sheer beauty of the tattoos,\" [she told the BBC in 2008](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-32737824). \"If you're going to have one done, you've got to think about it carefully because it's going to last a very long time, so you've got to be sure it's what you want,\" she warned at the time. Rocque Fonseca: Born 1936 \"Dad loves all animals but most of all, he likes cats. 'They don't backchat when you converse with them', he once quipped.\" This is my Dad, Rocque Fonseca. To others, his name is Roc. To us, he's our Rock, a rock of strength. Dad loves all animals but most of all, he likes cats. \"They don't backchat when you converse with them,\" he once quipped. Our 15-year-old cat Jessie passed away within a fortnight of Dad being admitted to hospital. It was the longest they'd been apart. His love helping keep her alive. On the day Dad was taken off life support, a special visitor was allowed into the Intensive Care Unit \u2014 our beloved family cat Billu. It was the last time we saw Dad smile. Soon after, Dad was moved into palliative care. It was there the bond between Dad and me became almost palpable. Some nurses even commented I was 'Daddy's girl'. Sounds lame, but they were right. Dad is my best friend. I'm always Dad's girl and he's always my hero. When I was little, I'd climb up and dance on his feet to old rock 'n' roll music. Even when I moved to the country for work, distance was no barrier to our daily daggy dad-daughter chats. We'd chinwag on the phone every night about anything and everything. Dad was never too busy to talk, listen, offer advice or simply engage in unhinged antics. One night, a nurse quietly approached to say Dad was hanging on for me. Eventually, upon seeing how much he was suffering, I told Dad it was okay to let go. Mum and I didn't leave his side all night. The next morning, Mum left to make a cup of tea. It was then, with my hand on his head, as we listened to The Beatles, Dad passed away peacefully. After days of rain, there was not a cloud in the sky. It was Sunday August 30, the same date as the anniversary of the death of Dad's brother Patrick. It was at the Royal Melbourne Hospital \u2014 the same place where Dad met Mum in 1980. They complemented each other, both being strong characters and both rather fond of felines. Soon after, they married and had two children. And, along with umpteen cats, they lived happily ever after. \u2014 by Allyson Fonseca Ernest Hugh Grimshaw: Born 1930 \"Ernest fondly recalled watching the battered warplanes flying over.\" My dad Ernest was 11 years old when he went to boarding school at Thornburgh in Charters Towers, North Queensland in 1942. He fondly recalls watching the battered warplanes flying low over the classrooms and school grounds. The boys would keep tally of the numbers of enemy planes, US planes and Australian planes coming and going. Often the US planes would limp in with engines missing, tails shot off, and riddled with bullet holes. Ernest was sitting in class daydreaming about being home and with the cattle and horses when he heard a plane coming in. It sounded extremely low as its engines spluttered and coughed loudly just outside the classroom. He jumped up and raced to the window. \"Wow, that one's not going to make it!\" he shouted, disrupting the whole class. They could hear the stalling motor, smell the smoke and see the flames pouring from the aircraft. The boys held their breath as they watched the badly shot up plane lose altitude. They could see the gunner was dead and slumped over the side. \"Is it one of ours, or is it a Jap plane?\" he yelled out. Whack! Pain shot across his backside as Ernest received six of the best cuts for causing mayhem in the normally controlled classroom. His form teacher did not approve of unruly behaviour. I ask myself if I would have done the same thing as Ernest? The answer is, of course! When books and lessons seemed so dull, the aircraft added an element of excitement. Dad and I shared stories of boarding school with each other, although mine were never as exciting as his. My father loved telling stories and I was always going to write them down for him; he had so many I could write a book. Even though he is gone, the stories live on. \u2014 by Maggie O Joan Kirner: Born 1938 \"She was our first female Premier. Because of her work, she won't be the last.\" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was right with his comment \u2014 [Joan Kirner, who died on June 1, was a trailblazer for women in Australian politics](/news/2015-06-01/former-victorian-premier-joan-kirner-dies/6513086). She began her working life as a school teacher and education activist, but in 1982, won a Labor seat in Victoria's Parliament. Later, as the Member for Williamstown, Kirner introduced education reforms such as the Victorian Certificate of Education, designed to reduce what she saw as class-based inequalities. She became Victoria's first female premier in 1990 after John Cain stepped down from the post. An only child and often portrayed as a working class girl, Joan Hood was born Moonee Ponds, her dad a fitter and turner, her mother a homemaker and teacher. Her father lost his job during the Depression and was forced to sell tea to save his family losing their home. It was from her dad that Kirner developed her sense of social justice, a trait former premier Steve Bracks admired. \"That was really the value that Joan Kirner brought to everything she did,\" Mr Bracks said. \"She never flinched. She was resolute in making sure she'd do the best she could as premier of the state.\" After studying at Melbourne University, Kirner began teaching and married fellow teacher Ron Kirner in 1960. It was after she took her son to kindergarten and learned there was only one teacher for 50 students that Kirner found her political voice. Appalled at the student-to-teacher ratio, she staged a loud protest outside the Department of Education and organised a petition, not stepping back until the school was granted more resources. From there, she became actively involved in the school's mothers' group, going on to become a representative of the Australian Schools Commission. The rest is history. Despite being lampooned for her dress sense and fondness for polka dots, Kirner was an enthusiastic and occasionally formidable politician. However, her time as Victorian leader was short-lived and she was swept out of power after just two years. She left with her dignity intact and will be remembered as a tireless advocate for women, the community and education. Joan Kirner is survived by her husband and three children, Michael, David and Kate. Hannah Davies: Born 1935 \"Singing was her passion.\" I met Hannah while she was visiting from England. Knowing that her mother and I shared a passion for singing, her daughter Hilary was determined that we meet. We got on famously, resulting in an invitation by Hannah to join a group of singers whom she was taking to Giarole, in Lombardy, Italy, for a week-long choral workshop. It was a dream I'd held for years \u2014 to sing renaissance music in the surroundings for which it was written. It was Hannah who made this dream come true. How can I describe her? Just over 80, her energy was abundant, her interest in others, and the world in general, copious. She had an extraordinary knack of making you feel as if you were the one person she wanted to spend time with at that particular moment. She moved, seemingly effortlessly, around the group of dedicated amateur musicians gathered in the courtyard of the Castello Sannazzaro, a castle built in the 12th century, rich in history. Hannah welcomed everyone, those who had attended a previous similar choral workshop and those like me, slightly apprehensive first-timers. Our nervousness evaporated immediately as she introduced us first to our host, Count Giuseppe and then to our English maestro, David. The week was sublime as we were stretched to produce our very best in singing and musicianship, leading to a concert for the people of the village only five days later. I don't think Hannah ever stopped smiling, revelling in the joy that this experience was giving us all. As a gift of appreciation, Geoff, a fellow-chorister, compiled a pictorial record of this remarkable event. As we said our good-byes, there were more than a few tears, but little did we know that less than a month later, this vivacious, warm-hearted special woman would be dead. She would not live to see the photo-book. Instead, it served as a memorial to her and was presented at her funeral to her husband and family. For the rest of us, we glow in the memory, grieve at the gap left by her, but give thanks for the privilege of having known her, however fleetingly. \u2014 by Jill Nash Con Maounis: Born 1939 \"Con was a family man born on the island of Paros in Greece.\" My dad was the most amazing man you would ever meet. He came here as an immigrant from Greece when he was 22 years old. He met the love of his life, Stella, whom he married. They had two kids, Eric and Mary. Dad worked hard for 45 years in different roles but his main passion was fishing. My dad Con always put his family first, but he worried he didn't have enough to provide for them. He loved his friends as they became his family here \u2014 his two brothers were in Canada and his sister in Greece. My dad, who everyone loved and no one would ever say a bad word about, died on August 26. He was the most amazing father and friend who took a piece of us the day he died. My dad, my angel, my hero. May you rest in peace and may you be smiling in heaven. I love you dad and miss you more than you will ever know. \u2014 by Mary Maounis Sandra Sessions (Van de Sande): Born 1962 \"Sandra would always say 'just go with the flow'. She loved music, her garden and family holidays to the beach.\" Earlier this year my beautiful mum passed away. She was 52, had lung cancer and had never smoked a cigarette in her life. Beyond that, she was a devoted mum to four, a grandmother, a sister and a daughter. She was cherished by so many for her courage and her ability to smile in the face of adversity \u2014 she would always say: 'just go with the flow'. She loved music, her garden and family holidays to the beach. This photo is a candid family photo of my mum. It was silly at the time, though a small moment which now means so much. She was a beautiful person who made me realise that life is short, and that it is the small moments in life that truly mean the most. \u2014 by K. Sessions Colleen McCullough: Born 1937 \"When we press the thorn to our chest we know, we understand, and still we do it.\" It was for her second novel, The Thorn Birds, a love story set on a remote sheep station in Central Australia, that writer Colleen McCullough is best known. The novel sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, was translated into 20 languages and became a TV miniseries. In a career spanning 40 years, McCullough went on to write prolifically in several genres, including biography and crime. She refused to consider a sequel to The Thorn Birds and instead, spent 13 years researching a seven-book historical series, Masters of Rome. But writing was just one of McCullough's talents. Before books there was science. McCullough studied medicine at the University of Sydney until an allergy to soap put an end to a career as a doctor. Instead, she turned to neuroscience, working as far afield as Yale Medical School. She came to writing after spending money for an overcoat on a Blue Bird portable typewriter, and while at Yale began her first novel, Tim. Her childhood was an unhappy one, with her parents regularly screaming at each other. Indeed, McCullough called her father \"a right bastard, a rogue and a philanderer\" and at his death, her mother was (wrongly) accused of poisoning him. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, she developed a big personality and forthright manner and became famous for her laugh, described as being \"like a drain\". She found love on Norfolk Island and married Ric Robinson, a Bounty-mutiny descendant, in 1984 and continued to write from the island. It was [here that she died on January 29](/news/2015-01-29/australian-author-colleen-mccullough-dies/6055952), after experiencing a multitude of medical ailments, including arthritis and diabetes. Kate Alexandra Turner: Born 1988 \"Kate endured pain every day of her life. Not that you would ever know. She always put on a brave front.\" My beautiful cousin Kate lost her battle with [Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)](http://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Epidermolysis_bullosa/) on Sunday July 19. She was just 26 years old. Kate endured this disease with pain every day of her life. Not that you would ever know. She never once complained and always put on a brave front. She had an extreme kindness and gentleness that made me proud to know her. Kate's strength and determination is something we can all aspire to. Kate's family and friends are all extremely proud and blessed to have had her in our lives. We were in awe of her. Linda, Kate's mum, devoted her life to Kate. Linda supported Kate to enjoy a life of achievement from whatever she put her mind to. They both experience life to the fullest, as it should be. Although we are all sad to have lost Kate to EB we will remember the good, the bad, the ugly, and the absolutely fabulous! Kate will always be in our hearts and souls. Kate's family and friends will always rally together to care and support each other in our sadness because that's what we do. I will always love you Kate Alexandra Turner and I hold all those precious memories dear to my heart. You rock girlfriend. \u2014 by Michelle Pickles Susan Adelaide Ayres: Born 1947 \"You were such a beautiful, strong person and loving mother to me.\" I know you won't like me sharing this photo, but it means a lot to me. It was our last photo taken together and our first in a very long time. We shared a lot that day the photo was taken. I will always treasure this day and the final week we had together. You were still your strong, independent self and wanted to shield me from what was happening to your body. This photo was taken at a hospital in a town called Wauchope, where we shared wonderful memories together when I was young. You took me to my first game of AFL here and afterwards we would always have lunch at the local RSL club. You were such a beautiful, strong person and loving mother to me. Not a day passes where I don't think of you. I love you mum. Your son, Simon. \u2014 by Simon Potter Bart Cummings: Born 1927 \"I keep my horses in the weakest of company and myself in the best of company. It's the best recipe for success that I know.\" The horse racing world [lost the \"Cups King\" James Bartholomew \"Bart\" Cummings, on August 30](/news/2015-08-30/bart-cummings-dies-aged-87/6735292). An asthmatic, Cummings had been told by his doctor, at age 16, to stay away from horses and chaff. But as Australian horse racing fans know, he ignored that advice and went on to become a legendary horse trainer. His horses won the Melbourne Cup 12 times in a career that featured horses trained by him winning almost 7,000 races. In 1974, he became the first trainer in the British Commonwealth to train winners of more than $1 million of prize money. \"He was a sensational trainer with a fantastic eye for a horse and would always run his hand over the horse, almost like he was talking to them through his hands,\" SA Jockey Club chief Brenton Willis said. Cummings, a shy man with a very dry sense of humour, was born in Glenelg, South Australia. Aged 11, he had a near-death experience in which he almost drowned after jumping from the Glenelg pier and being swept out to sea. After leaving school, Cummings briefly worked in a menswear shop and picked grapes before becoming a strapper for his father. He got his trainer's licence in 1953 and the next year married Valmae Baker, whom he had met at a barn dance. After opening his own stables in 1968, Cummings went training winners and taking chances, investing huge sums in race horses. Some of those chances paid off and some did not, but he followed a philosophy of looking ahead and not dwelling on the past. Cummings' success could be attributed to the fact always put horses first. Among his many accolades, he was named a Living Treasure by the National Trust and made it onto an Australia Post stamp. Nicholas Duncan MacBean: Born 1985 \"Nic didn't care too much for money and the symbols of status \u2014 but he did care about people.\" This photograph, posted by Nic on Instagram in mid-2014, epitomises him. It was taken at an Indigenous School near Darwin, following a Save The Children fundraising trek through Kakadu National Park. The caption read: \"Spent the morning having slime thrown at me by brilliant kids at Bagot community outside Darwin. They were at the end-of-semester party celebrating good school attendances\". Nic loved bushwalking and he loved and cared about people. He loved and was loved by his family, his friends and his workmates. [Nic was a journalist with the ABC](/news/2015-11-18/a-tribute-to-nic-macbean-a-top-bloke/6951136). He was talented \u2014 in 2009 he won the Walkley Australian Young Journalist of the Year Award in the Online Category for his coverage of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. His sensitive and powerful coverage was about the effect of the bushfires on people. He had a talent too, for photography, which developed further as he moved into a role as a photo editor. But the same year Nic won his Young Walkley, depression started to affect his life and worsened over the next several years. But here's the thing \u2014 Nic was not only brave in trying to deal with his own demons, he also shared his story, reached out quietly to others and made a difference in their lives. Nic didn't care too much for money and the symbols of status \u2014 but he did care about people \u2014 it's perhaps the key thing that made him good at his work, and that made him such a good bloke. Nic loved travel \u2014 the places and the people. He spent the year after finishing school in England, working at a school in Surrey, and during breaks travelled through Europe and to North Africa. He returned to England later, as part of his university studies, and travelled back home to Brisbane via South America. He travelled with friends to Turkey and Bulgaria. Nic loved camping. He loved nature, he loved bushwalking with like-minded people and he loved the peace. Some of his best photographs were taken in the bush. Nic loved his sport too. He played cricket throughout his school years and Aussie Rules with Sherwood and the Woodsmen. He loved going to the 'Gabba and other major grounds interstate to watch the Brisbane Lions and test cricket matches. He went to Lords and to Wimbledon while he was in England, and he became a fan of Arsenal in the English Premier League and a very loyal follower of Gillingham in League 1 in England. What we'll remember most about Nic is his smile, his wit, his generosity of spirit, his warmth and his love of family and friends. We'll miss him, but he has left us so much to remember him by.

The diminutive woman with a gentle smile campaigned tirelessly for human rights and social justice and [was listed among the 100 most influential Australians of the 20th century](http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/bandler-ida-lessing-faith-15982). She was a founding member of the Woman's Electoral Lobby and championed Aboriginal education and housing and for the rights of South Sea Islanders. Not content with those achievements, Bandler also wrote six books and during World War II, joined the Women's Land Army. She was born Ida Lessing Faith Mussing in Tumbulgum, NSW to a mother of Indian-Scottish descent and a father stolen as a child by blackbirders. Wacvie Mussingkon had been taken from his home in what is now Vanuatu as a boy in 1883. He was sold into slavery in Mackay and spent the next 20 years on sugar plantations. Bandler first began to campaign for the right of Indigenous people in 1956 and co-founded the Aboriginal Australian Fellowship. She was also involved in the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. In 1976, she refused to accept an MBE in protest at Gough Whitlam's dismissal but accepted an Order of Australia in 1984 for her services to Aboriginal welfare. The National Trust listed her as a National Living Treasure. On [news of her death on February 13](/news/2015-02-14/political-activist-and-writer-faith-bandler-dies-aged-96/6097636), NSW Opposition spokeswoman Linda Burney said Bandler was an inspiration for all Australians. \"Faith, whom I knew, was just the most gracious, powerful woman who believed in decency and justice for everyone,\" Ms Burney said. \"She was just a hero for everyone and particularly for Aboriginal people in this country.\" She married Jewish refugee Hans Bandler in 1952 and is survived by a daughter, Lilon. Kevin Schubert: Born 1930 \"For Dad to share an adventure with his family was his greatest pleasure in life.\" I have great memories of my dad working at TAA at Coolangatta Airport on the Gold Coast. Dad was a keen fisherman and would love to share his catch with his workmates. One particular Friday night, he was driving the bus from Surfers to the airport and our family went for a ride with him \u2014 45 years ago this was a treat for my sister and I. Dad had caught some mud crabs in his pots near Jacobs Well and wanted to give some to the boys at work. He tied their claws, put them on the bus and away we went. Half way down, they escaped and there were mud crabs trying to grab our feet. Mum, my sister and I were screaming and climbing over seats as Dad wrangled them into the box. It's a wonderful memory \u2014 the chaos that this created. Thankfully, the crabs and our family arrived intact at the airport and no-one had any idea what we just went through. The crabs were cooked and eaten and enjoyed. For Dad to share an adventure with his family was his greatest pleasure in life. \u2014 by Karen Unser Daryl Leigh McManus: Born 1959 \"Daz, my chemo buddy, I miss you.\" Daz was diagnosed with bowel cancer just before my breast cancer diagnosis. He was my best friend's partner. We both fought the fight over the past four years. He was my chemo buddy. Daz and I rode the roller coaster of cancer together. He always knew when I needed a call, a visit, a hug. He had the best smile. I've survived but Daz hasn't. Daz lost the battle in June this year. \u2014 by Jules Dr Ruth Hilary White: Born 1926 \"My Auntie Ruth ... what a woman.\" When I was little she was this wonderfully exotic person who would fly in from far off lands and bring gifts of things we had never seen. She brought us Halloween decades before it was seen in Australia. We treasured the wonderful \"scary\" decorations and saved them for years and years having to have our own celebration as no one else knew what it was. Ruth was actually flying in from New York where she was studying a masters of education followed by a doctorate of education. She studied in New York as a recipient of the National Florence Nightingale Scholarship. This was presented to Ruth after completing her Bachelor of Arts at ANU. As I grew up in the 70s, Ruth was becoming an expert in curriculum development and evaluation for nursing education. Ruth worked with a team of nurses who ultimately moved nursing training from hospital-based training to a bachelor degree within tertiary institutions. This work culminated in Ruth taking up a position as Head of the School of Health professionals at Sturt College of advanced education in SA. I remember we had a huge family holiday driving around the Victorian coast to end up in SA to visit Auntie Ruth. I remember a great celebration, she was great at celebrations. Ruth never forgot our birthdays; she always celebrated milestones, achievements and great events. Ruth's achievements were enormous and her passion for nursing unending. Her compassion was at a level I don't see in many others. This was formally recognised in 1997 with her entry as a member into the order of Australia recognising her as a pioneer and leader in nursing education and health care, and to the community in the care of the disadvantaged and people with AIDS related illnesses. I know she has left a lasting legacy in many institutions both here and around the world from her wonderful work in the development of nursing education. I know she has touched so many lives and she definitely has left the world a better place. \u2014 by Janet White Thomas Paul Kikkert: Born 1969 \"Tommy was not a fisherman, not ever. Golf was his sport. He hated fishing.\" My younger brother passed away in June 2015 of brain cancer. I moved to Tamworth from Hobart to look after him as he had no-one there to take care of him. I couldn't stand the thought of him dying without at least one adult family member with him. He was a wonderful, funny, generous man who spent the last two months of his life buying gifts for friends and family and saying goodbye to them. The two months I had with him, even the time spent by his bedside, were an amazing, never-to-be forgotten time, learning about my brother and the amazing man he was. He was very loved by the Tamworth community, having worked at one of the local pubs as a barman for many years and, latterly, at Big W. These people welcomed me with open arms and showed me the same love during the time I was there. He left behind his 10-year-old son who is the bravest young man I've ever known (just like his dad). This photo of Tom makes everyone laugh. Tommy was not a fisherman, not ever. Golf was his sport. He hated fishing. He'd go along with his mates and sit in the car for hours reading his latest Stephen King book, very happy doing so. This was the first time in years that anyone saw him actually fishing rather than reading. He was incredibly happy with his catch on the day, as witnessed by the look on his face. We miss him every day and will forever do so. RIP Tommy. \u2014 by Elliemcn Bryan (Fred) John Smith: Born 1969 \"Put him in the middle of a city and five minutes later, he would be engrossed in conversation with a stranger.\" Fred was a stockman, he was big and gruff and drew people to him. His love of the outdoors, his unsurpassed skill with working dogs, the talent to clear a fence a fraction of a second before an angry cow hit the other side \u2014 all with a grin on his face. There was his ability to talk to anyone. Plop the farm boy in the middle of a city and five minutes later, he would be engrossed in a conversation with a complete stranger. His sheer enjoyment in his everyday world and his desire to share the experience; countless visitors chauffeured around the paddocks on the back of a ute, treated to displays of working dogs versus errant farm stock to the background sound of a stock whip and an ear-piercing whistle. When the ute reached the crest of his favourite hill, out would come the plough-disc barbecue and he would cook lunch with amazing views as his backdrop. As a husband, father and grandfather he was the centre of our world, the dad that would jump on his teenage sons and wrestle around the lounge room. He was the party uncle, sleepovers and silliness, yet also the adult that would talk to them on an equal footing. Master of the Sunday brunch, organiser of winery bus trips and proud owner of a killer recipe for crumbed sausages and onion gravy. A stroke was cruel, cancer crueller still. Through it all was that smile, a wicked sense of humour and a love for his family that got us through. You'll always be there, hat low, hands deep in pockets, grin in place, standing on the hill, and every time it rains we'll see you heading resolutely out the door to work, because you weren't made of sugar. \u2014 by Jac Robert E Locke: Born 1967 \"He was a passionate advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and social justice.\" My Uncle Rob was diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2015 but he was a fighter and had begun the fight of his life. Regardless of the challenges he faced, Uncle Rob was fiercely determined to do things his way. Throughout his fight, he never lost his smile and infectious laugh. He would light up anyone's day. Even through the toughest time in his life, he still managed to smile and remain positive. Uncle Rob was definitely one of a kind. He loved a party and any excuse to dress up! He was a passionate advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and social justice. Uncle Rob was a son, brother, father, uncle, cousin, nephew and was a beautiful person who touched the lives of so many. On October 31 he lost his battle and our world was turned upside down. He taught us so many lessons \u2014 except how to live without him. Uncle Rob was taken from us far too soon but we take comfort that he is now pain-free and will live on in our hearts. \u2014 by Cass Tratt Raymond Reece Wells : Born 1930 \"I am sure if there is a life after death Mum and Dad are together and at peace.\" My dad, Raymond Reece Wells, was born in Bournemouth England, where he lived for most of his life. Dad was a keen amateur boxer in his youth, and he left school at an early age to join the merchant navy. After he married, he left the navy, and had a number of diverse jobs over the years. He finally followed his father and settled into the trade of painter and decorator. Eventually, as the family grew, Dad had to supplement his income by working evenings as a chef at a restaurant in town; he also worked in a bakery one night a week. He would come home from his day job, have dinner and then take off again for his evening in the kitchen or the bakery. As the oldest of five children, I had to grow up fast and pull my weight with the chores. When Mum died suddenly in April 2005 Dad ceased to live, merely biding his time until he was re-united with the love of his life. He worshipped Mum and found it hard to come to terms with the loss. He succumbed to dementia, and within a couple of years was in a nursing home. It was hard for me, living on the other side of the world, to hear of his decline. Harder still for my four siblings who watched it every day. For the last few years, he rarely recognised his own children. He died this year, and I was glad I was there at the end, even if he never knew it. I don't know what happens to us when we die, but I am sure if there is a life after death Mum and Dad are together and at peace. \u2014 by Malcolm Wells Adele Horin: Born 1951 \"Dear readers, my luck has run out. I'm not going to be one of those feisty octogenarians I so admired.\" This is how award-winning blogger, writer and journalist Adele Horin told her faithful readers that her lung cancer had returned. The response to her news crashed her website [adelehorin.com.au](http://adelehorin.com.au/). Horin had been the Sydney Morning Herald's social affairs journalist for 18 years until 2013, but continued to deliver a regular column. The themes in her work were always socially focussed and often reflected the stages in her life, with her later years spent writing earnestly of the trials and joys of ageing. Born in Perth, Western Australia in 1951, Horin had modest upbringing in suburban Jewish family, studying in public schools and at the University of Western Australia. She began her journalism career on the West Australian's women's pages but it was diving deep into social affairs and human rights where Horin found her voice. Her journalism career took her to London, Washington, New York and Afghanistan, where she spent time with the mujahedeen for a story. Aged just 23, she was banned from returning to Chile after reporting on families living under General Pinochet's oppressive regime. \"Her trailblazing reporting on the potentially explosive social changes taking place right under our noses helped to transform Australian journalism,\" [her Sydney Morning Herald obituary said](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/trailblazing-journalist-adele-horin-took-it-to-the-edge-20151124-gl6k8z.html). But Horin shunned the praise for her work and her style of reporting despite proving herself fair, accurate and innovative time and time again. In the early 1980s she wrote a series about sex in Australia for the National Times, which went on to win a Walkley Award. The series was the first time the word \"orgasm\" had been published in the newspaper \u2014 an act which landed company director John B Fairfax in hot water with the board. Four years ago, her explosive article in the Herald about abuse of disabled residents in a boarding house led to her winning a Human Rights award. In a final blog post, six days before her death, Horin modestly wrote of her career: \"As women tend to do, I've attributed my moderate successes in life to luck. Yes, hard work and intelligence do play a part, but luck stands out as queen of the trifecta.\" Adele Horin died on November 21. She was honoured by her colleagues and peers at this year's Walkley Awards. Leslie John Burroughs: Born 1951 \"Les was not only a police officer but an avid campaigner for people and kids that were less fortunate.\" Sergeant Les Burroughs was a one in a million human. He served the state of NSW and the greater community of the Eastern Suburbs area for nearly 41 years, entirely in uniform. Les was not only a police officer but an avid campaigner for people and kids that were less fortunate than most people. He was also a great Sergeant and always treated his troops fair, even if we made mistakes. Les was a great friend and mentor. He will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of coming into contact with him, and this was evident at his final celebration of life. I miss you Les and the war stories that we use to natter about when we caught up. Thank you for the honour of knowing you, both personally and in our working career. \u2014 by Dave Snelson Judith Ann Jenkins: Born 1947 \"I met and loved an amazing new part of my mum, and for that I am thankful.\" My mum lived a hard life. So many things happened that no person should have to deal with. Her life should have been warm and easy and full of true genuine love, but it wasn't, and still she raised her children to know love and to want the best from themselves. Family and love was her desire, and her goal and in the last months of her life she was a great success. My mum was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and brain metastases with a seven-month prognosis. I found her collapsed in the shower, she had been lying there 16 hours. She had to leave her farm, leave her beautiful puppy, her friends, go into care and confront her mortality in a two-week period. Over the next 10 months she showed a quiet strength \u2014 the likes of which I had never seen before \u2014 dignity and a burning desire to love her kids and ensure they knew how important they were, while continuing to teach them what was right and wrong. In her illness and her death I met and loved an amazing new part of my mum, and for that I am thankful. This photo shows her laughing without a care as we share a \"fluffy coffee\" at the seaside, and in the sea breeze it ended up all over her. I remember this carefree laugh and hold it tightly. \u2014 by Seaside lover Grandpa Ball: Born 1917 \"This is my Grandpa. He died last week, age 98. He was a truly wonderful man.\" My grandpa died last week. He was a kind, clever and compassionate man and even though he was so very old, he was still smart and interested in everyone around him. That was the thing about Grandpa; he was interested in you \u2014 what you thought, what you wanted, what you did. Not just us, but everyone. Whilst in hospital he asked the doctor/nurse/cleaner from a non-English-speaking background how to say hello in their first language. From then on. that's how Grandpa would greet them. Grandpa taught us, via his deeds more than his words, to treat others as you would have them treat you. He sent us cards at Christmas that included a gift of a cow to a poor African village. I think I've contributed, via Grandpa, six cows, several veggie patches and even a drinking well over the past 10 years. He sent my kids funny poems and short stories he had written. I remember as a child sitting at Grandpa's feet, listening to him recount stories \u2014 without a book \u2014 that held me enchanted and enthralled. He encouraged, listened, comforted and cared. His younger brother Peter died in the war age 18. He lost two wives, both to cancer. He lived with us for a time after my own father died. He was solid, strong and dependable. In the weeks before he died, he spoke with all four of his daughters at length about his wishes for his funeral. 'No' to Amazing Grace as a hymn, and he had pre-paid for his biodegradable coffin. He grew sicker and so my Mum left from England, praying he wouldn't die yet. He waited, in what I think was his final act of giving, for all of his daughters to be at his side and then slowly, gently, he went to eternal rest. I can't be sad for the magnificent life he led and the legacy he gave us as a family. I am sad though, that he is gone. He was a wonderful man and I loved him dearly. Life goes on, but for the moment it feels slightly less without him. Rest now Grandpa. \u2014 by deadlyclaire Kingston Brendan James Smith: Born 2012 \"Kingston was a very happy little boy when he died.\" Kingston was a very happy little boy when he died. He was two years and 11 months old and it was a very unexpected death. He is missed so much by all his family and everyone who knew him. Kingston always loved a cuddle and a kiss and he loved life. He loved riding his bike, climbing and playing outside. He also liked books and singing songs, especially ones with hand actions! We miss you Kingston and there's a big hole in our hearts now. RIP baby boy xx \u2014 by Dianne Smith Jonah Lomu: Born 1975 \"Jonah was a legend of the game and [was] loved by his many fans.\" The towering 1.96 metre tall, 119 kilogram former All Blacks rugby union player [died suddenly of a heart attack on November 18](/news/2015-11-18/former-all-black-star-jonah-lomu-dies/6950990) following a long-haul flight. He was once seen as the most unstoppable force in international rugby and his huge form racing down the pitch, clutching the ball, with defensive players falling in his wake was a sight to behold. Lomu made his international test debut with the New Zealand side in 1994, the youngest All Black ever, but rose to stardom after a stellar performance in South Africa's 1995 World Cup. In the semi-final of that series, Lomu almost single-handedly won the game after scoring four tries and running through a shell-shocked English defence as the All Blacks won 45-29. Jonah Tali Lomu was born in Auckland, New Zealand to Semesi and Hepi Lomu but a year later, after his brother was born, he was given to his aunt and taken to the Ha'aipai Islands in Tonga. Six years later, his parents brought him back to New Zealand where he had to learn to speak English. His father would beat him regularly and Lomu grew up surrounded by violence; by the age of 15, he was known to police and his father threw him out of home. Thanks to the foresight and compassion of a high school teacher and a rugby coach, Lomu's potential as an exceptional athlete was identified and his anger and aggression were soon channelled into rugby union. It was not long before he attracted the attention of All Black selectors and the rest is history. \"Jonah was a legend of the game and [was] loved by his many fans, both here and around the world,\" New Zealand rugby chief executive Steve Tew said via Twitter. Lomu's rugby career was cut short not by injury but by a rare kidney complaint called nephritic syndrome which required him to undergo dialysis five times a week. He had a kidney transplant in 2004 and attempted a return to rugby but various injuries sent him to the bench. Lomu retired in 2002 with 63 caps and 37 international tries and is survived by his third wife Nadene and two children. Ray Behsman: Born 1950 \"A great Aussie bloke with a million stories to tell.\" I met Ray when he was pushing dams in the Central Wheatbelt in about 1994. He revolutionised the way dams were sunk by digging round holes rather than a square or rectangle. Ray was quick with a smile and a joke, and always willing to lend a hand if you needed. He told me many a tale of clearing land at Condingup on the south-east coast, but one that stuck in my mind was that he was pulled up in Esperance with his two bulldozers parked sideways on the low loader. He was trying to save a second trip, by loading them both at once. Was it true? You never know. \u2014 by Charloteedv Henry Lewis Gerard Ford: Born 2015 \"A little boy and his bear will always be playing ...\" (A.A Milne) On April 22, my daughter gave birth to, and said goodbye to, her first child and my fourth grandchild. Baby Henry was just over 20 weeks when his little life ended. The only thing I was able to do was to make him some tiny clothes to be buried in as there was nothing small enough in the premmie baby clothes available anywhere that I could find. It was a task laden with pain, tears blurring every stitch. Pain at not being able to 'fix it' for my daughter, and the pain of all the Grandma times I would never have with that precious and much-loved little man. \u2014 by Batesy Hanh Tran: Born 1954 \"A generous and inspirational teacher and a talented photographer.\" The former CEO of Radio Australia, Hanh Tran, [died suddenly on September 3](http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2015-09-04/vale-hanh-tran-former-ceo-of-radio-australia/1489304) leading to a stream of [emotional tributes on social media](https://www.facebook.com/RadioAustralia/photos/a.230024090347878.75891.128522530498035/1177201472296797/?type=3&theater). Tran was remembered for his leadership, for his great cooking, for being \"an exceptional father\", as a teacher, a mentor and so much more. \"A generous and inspirational teacher and a talented photographer,\" wrote one, John Gunn. \"His sage advice and mentoring contributed greatly to me own photographic practise and career as an ABC cameraman.\" The young man who fled Vietnam in 1972 with a golden opportunity, was from a family of ten children. \"I got a scholarship so it was a very, very good reason to leave the country, to leave the war behind,\" Tran said in a 2008 interview. Tran began life with a degree in forestry but soon found media and in particular, photography, was his passion. He said that as a migrant, he saw Australia with \"a peculiar view\" and soon his work was the Parliament House Art Collection Collection. Tran first worked with Radio Australia in the early 1990s, which gave him the opportunity to do something for Vietnam. \"I really loved using the sound to describe, you know, paint a picture, if you like,\" he said. A stint as the BBC's head of their Vietnamese Service followed where he learned valuable skills which he brought back to Australia. As CEO of Radio Australia, Tran was the voice of Australia to the Asian region. \"I hope that I'm a bridge,\" he said in 2008. \"I'm someone who can actually prove that people can move between cultures, across national boundaries and doing the kind of thing that cements relations between people.\" General Eva Burrows: Born 1929 \"She pleased God'. That's one very important thing to me; that my life has been pleasing to the God I serve.\" It could be said General Evangeline Evelyn Burrows was born with the Salvos in her blood. Both her parents were Salvation Army majors and following her birth in Newcastle, NSW, her father came home from Sunday service, [lifted his baby daughter out of her cot and declared:](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/world/europe/eva-burrows-salvation-army-leader-dies-at-85.html?_r=0) \"I dedicate this child to the glory of God and the salvation of the world.\" Her parents even named their eighth child after Evangeline Booth, the daughter of the Salvation Army's founder and its first female international commander. Burrows became the second \u2014 in 1986 \u2014 and the youngest. She served as the leader of the Salvation Army, the highest ecclesiastical position held by any woman in the world, for seven years. The family grew up poor and nomadic, moving around as her parents' followed their calling. As a child, Burrows played the tambourine but recalled rebelliousness in high school wanting to \"be herself\". It was while she was at university, the first in her family to attend, that she asked God's forgiveness of her rebelliousness and vowed to submit. From then, Burrows committed her life to the Salvation Army, serving in Zimbabwe, Britain, Sri Lanka, Scotland and Australia. She spoke out against apartheid, worked to help women, revamped the organisation's financial structure and engineered a return of the Salvation Army to Eastern Europe after it had been banned under Communism. Even after retirement, Burrows continued her work in Melbourne with homeless youth and Bible groups and served on the International Bible Society. She was energetic and enthusiastic and her willingness to engage with everyman earned her the moniker, 'the People's General'. \"'She pleased God'. That's one very important thing to me; that my life has been pleasing to the God I serve,\" [Burrows said when asked by her biographer what she would like on her tombstone](https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and-heritage/Salvation-Army-generals/Eva-Burrows/Eva-Burrows/). [General Burrows was 'promoted to glory'](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/religionandethicsreport/general-eva-burrows-27promoted-to-glory27/6365536) on March 20. Kevin John Warren: Born 1927 \"A family man, a man of poetry and fishing, the patriarch of a well known fishing family in Eden, NSW.\" Eden has lost another of its icons with the passing of my father, Kevvy Warren on August 6. Dad was born in 1927, and was always destined for a life on the sea. The family built many of their boats \u2014 one of which was the Silver Cloud \u2014 built for Dad by his grandfather in the family property. Dad was one of the true pioneers in the fishing industry in the early days when the local townspeople referred to them as \"two bob fishermen with barely a cent between them.\" Fishing then, as now, for most men of the sea, was about lifestyle as much as a way to earn a living. Some people, like Dad, are simply born with salt water in their veins. He loved new challenges and was driven to push the boundaries; to learn, explore, experiment and do his best to stay ahead of the game of fishing. He left the safe harbour of Twofold Bay and sailed to Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania in pursuit of the elusive fish while continually changing and upgrading his boats so that he could try new methods of fishing. In the 1960s, he pioneered the use of light aircraft to spot for both tuna and salmon. He bought his own planes, employed pilots to fly them and took to the air, and he went to great lengths to pass messages about the location and size of a patch of fish to his boats without the opposition listening in. I recall he dropped messages from his planes on, or near, the boats at sea in Milo tins, worked out secret codes which he gave over the radio and at one stage even learned a little French to direct his boats to the fish. Dad's passion for fishing was surpassed by his passion for family. Mum accompanied him on many of his voyages interstate and Dad set up an HF radio at our home so Mum could always monitor the boat's movements and pass on messages to their families. The fact that his sons and each of his four grandsons have chosen to continue the family tradition of life on the sea was a great source of pride for Dad and testament to his inspiration. When Dad finally \"retired\" from professional fishing, he and Mum hooked up their caravan, took up recreational fishing and spent many years travelling Australia from top to bottom, camping by rivers, lakes, estuaries and the coast \u2014 anywhere they could drop a line. I know that Eden will miss in Dad another of its special characters, many of whom have been lost in recent times. With their loss, a part of the town's history disappears and they will be forever missed. \u2014 by Cheryl Maree Healey: Born 1952 \"I'd like to introduce you to my Mum. Always smiling, she had a natural remedy for everything!\" I was blessed to have this amazing lady as my mum for 40 years. Always smiling, she had a natural remedy for everything! When your mum gives you a book called '1,001 Uses for Vinegar' you know she's got things covered! Ask anyone what they miss about my mum and they will tell you, it's her hugs and her cooking. But it's our chats I miss the most; chats about everything and nothing much. Butterflies are now our link to you. They adorn the walls in my home, they appear in your grandchildren's artwork, there is even one tattooed onto my forearm. Love you mumma. \u2014 by Amanda Healey Felicity Wishart: Born 1965 \"All Australians, whether they realise it or not, owe a debt of gratitude for her work.\" In a career spanning more than three decades, environmental campaigner and conservationist Felicity Wishart, or 'Flic', played a leading role in protecting the Great Barrier Reef and Australian rainforests from land clearing. She was a hugely influential worker with the Australian Conservation Foundation, The Wilderness Society, the Queensland Conservation Council and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). \"Flic was one of Australia's leading conservationists and was a great and inspiring champion for the planet, the cause she dedicated her life to,\" the AMCS said. \"None worked harder, with as much grace and achieved as many results to protect our heritage. \"All Australians, whether they realise it or not, owe a debt of gratitude for her work.\" She mentored new campaigners, especially up and coming women in the environmental movement. Her goal was to see change through her ability to inspire others, she made change happen. Wishart was born in Melbourne and grew up with five brothers which probably helped her to develop the tenacity she showed as an adult. At age 17, she joined protesters fighting to save the damming of Tasmania's Franklin River and, like many others, was arrested and jailed briefly. After studying environmental science at university, she immediately began work to protect our natural heritage. She was involved in the successful campaign by the Australian Conservation Foundation to list North Queensland's tropical rainforests as World Heritage sites. From rainforests she moved to prevent land clearing in Queensland, then climate change and marine conservation. At the time of [her unexpected death in her sleep on July 20](/news/2015-07-21/aust-conservationist-felicity-wishart-dies-at-49-amcs/6637356), Wishart was working on the Fight for the Reef campaign with AMCS. Nick Russell Miles: Born 1992 \"He cooked meals for his brothers and me, his father; vindaloo was a favourite.\" Nick was part of the usual 'less than perfect family', with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure. As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected. He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother Rosemary dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life. My son Nick had a powerful memory. Before he started school, he could name each of the Thomas the Tank Engines: James, Gordon, Annie and Clarabel, and many others. He could put away one or two trains in his toy box, but when faced with too many, he was unable to comprehend a solution. He had abundant patience, which he drew on when working as a personal care attendant. He cooked meals for his brothers and me, his father; vindaloo was a favourite. Nick often cycled to work, even in the midst of winter. One summer we volunteered for the Great Victorian Bike Ride. I rarely saw him as he worked and partied with the many other young volunteers. Nick enjoyed drawing, as did his grandfather and great-grandfather who shared a family curse of depression; Japanese anime was his preferred style. He often preferred familiar activities with people he knew. Then again, he'd recently joined a drawing group, and chatted with people about movies at the Russian Film Festival. Nick had sought medical advice on his own initiative a few months prior, about the increased anxiety he was experiencing. He took the prescribed medication. He did not miss any appointments with the clinical psychologist. Nick had also enrolled in a TAFE course in bakery. We cannot know what was in Nick's mind on the evening he died in January and why he so hastened into this good night. He was 22 years old. His family has earnestly reflected on how we might have better supported Nick. There was a train driver who was also involved in this incident, and who has been greatly traumatised. Nick is buried with his mother in Eltham Cemetery. If you need advice about coping with your situation, there are lots of places to get help, including your local GP. You can call Lifeline (24/7) on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue (24/7) on 1300 22 46 36. \u2014 by Fluellen Priscilla Kincaid-Smith: Born 1926 \"Her research endeavours and education endeavours are almost unparalleled in renal disease.\" Discovering the link between headache tablets and kidney disease was just one of Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith's many achievements. She was also a trailblazer for women in science and medicine, paving a prestigious path with some of the world's most respected institutions. Born in Johannesburg, South Africa as one of four children, she was a talented swimmer and hockey player, enjoying sport almost more than study. Despite this, Kincaid-Smith began university at 16 but was thought too young to study physical education, so began a medical science degree. [According to the AMA](https://ama.com.au/ausmed/obituary-emeritus-professor-pricilla-kincaid-smith), she topped most of her classes and discovered her passion for medicine. After studying pathology and cardiology in London, she and her husband Dr Ken Fairley moved to Australia in 1958 where she met her first challenge as a female doctor. Because of the laws of the time, Kincaid-Smith was told she could not work as she was married. Kincaid-Smith, [who died in Melbourne on July 18](/news/2015-07-21/trailblazing-female-scientist-priscilla-kincaid-smith-remembered/6637276), was the first female professor at the University of Melbourne and the first female chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. In addition, she was the first female chair of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and the first female chair, and Australian, of the World Medical Association. Her most important discovery was the link between popular headache powders, [Bex and Vincent's](https://medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au/node/302500715), and kidney disease during the 1960s. She went on to lobby for restrictions on the availability of the analgesics. Kincaid-Smith was a major force behind the establishment of the renal transplant unit at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. \"For their time, [her achievements] were quite remarkable,\" colleague Professor Rowan Walker said. \"Her research endeavours and education endeavours are almost unparalleled in renal disease. She was very much bent on preventing patients reaching end-stage kidney disease.\" She was just as passionate about her family as she was about her work and, encouraged by her husband, returned to work three weeks after giving birth to twin boys. Two of her three children were dyslexic so she read all their schoolbooks onto tapes. According to one son, she would say: \"There's only one thing that matters: that your kids know you love them.\" Jude Townson: Born 1948 \"Jude was warm, funny, talented and non-judgmental.\" Jude was a wonderful, warm person who always found time to help her friends. She was a talented artist and a much loved member of the Stokers Siding community in northern NSW. The breast cancer which she had shaken off years before returned, and this time it was relentless. My only regret was that I never made that catch-up phone call which had been on my mind for weeks \u2014 until it was too late. I miss you Jude and so do all your friends and family, including Miss Molly the mad poodle who I believe was with you till the end. Travel well darling. \u2014 by Claire Andrew MacDonald: Born 1952 \"He put all his energy into making a happy childhood for his children and grandchildren.\" Dad was at his happiest when playing with kids, in particular his two grand-daughters, but any kid would do. He was like a big kid himself; round face, big smile, roaring laugh, and always up for some mischievous fun. His own childhood was a lonely one, so he put all his energy into making a happy childhood for his children and grandchildren. There were always games \u2014 tickling, chasing, teasing and later, 'in-jokes' and nicknames. Dad passed away in February. He spent the last few months and weeks of his life playing games. Struggling out of hospital on Christmas Day last year in a wheelchair, there was still some energy left for water pistol fights with the kids. At his hospital bedside, it was 'Chinese Checkers', 'Snakes and Ladders' and dominoes. In his favourite chair in the sunny rumpus room, it was cross-words, Sudoku and word-searches. Somewhere, someplace, is a special man, creating joy with the roll of a dice. Congratulations dear Dad, you have completed a great game, now rest in peace my dear one. \u2014 by Kylie MacDonald Terry John Finn: Born 1955 \"He was very wise, loyal, a great listener and observer.\" My Dad's passion throughout his life was riding bikes. He taught me not only to ride a bike, but as well as that, he taught me what is most important in life. He didn't need materialistic \"things\" in his life. Time spent with family and friends was his priority. Oh, maybe just the occasional Arnott's chocolate teddy bear biscuit and a Carlton draught here and there and he was more than happy. Dad worked hard all his life and after a career, first as a pastry cook (he was famous for his shortbread biscuits at Christmas time) and then as a customs officer, he had recently retired and settled down to enjoy his family, travels in the great outdoors, and of course more time to ride. Dad loved weekends away in the family caravan. He enjoyed having a campfire and would sit with his grandkids on his lap, pointing out the Southern Cross in the night sky, telling them stories about \"when he was a little boy....\" He was a devoted \"Pa\" and cherished his grandchildren immensely. Dad was a very relaxed person, never worrying about the little things that didn't matter. He was very wise, loyal, a great listener and observer. His exceptional wit and humour will be greatly missed by all that knew him. He had so much more to do. Sadly, Dad lost his life after he was hit by a car while out riding his bike on a sunny day in October. We know he would like us to advocate for more road safety awareness in the community. Ride on dad, ride on. \u2014 by Allison Fathers Brenda Bartlem-Ward: Born 1941 \"Mum would've given you her last 20 cents or the shirt off her back if you needed it.\" My Mum was an amazing woman. She raised me by herself from when I was 14 years old. Nothing was ever too much trouble for her. All my friends loved her and we would sometimes have 10 or more kids bring their school lunches to eat on our lounge room floor. Mum only went to year six in her education and to make ends meet, she took in people's ironing and cleaned their houses. Money was tight but life was happy. In our small town, Mum was known to all as 'Mama'. She loved children and they loved her right back. Along with her five biological grandchildren, she 'adopted' many more. She was with her partner Des, for 31 years and she had her beloved little dog Misty. Mum would've given you her last 20 cents or the shirt off her back if you needed it. If I turn out to be half the woman Mum was, I will be happy. Mum spent her last weeks in a hospital. She suffered with [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](http://www.aihw.gov.au/copd/) (but had never smoked in her life), along with many other illnesses. In the end, she lost the use of her arms and legs and could do nothing for herself. Mum had always been my best friend and she begged me to make sure no other people suffered as she did. That is why I have started a petition to change the voluntary euthanasia laws in Australia. The petition is on change.org. No other beautiful angels should have to suffer as my darling Mum did. \u2014 by Vicky Crichton Malcolm Fraser: Born 1930 \"What we do not know, we often fear. What we do not understand, we fear. And what we fear becomes a threat.\" Australia's 22nd prime minister, John Malcolm Fraser [died aged 84 on March 20.](/news/2015-03-20/malcolm-fraser-dies-after-short-illness/6334620) As a minister in John Gorton's government, he was the first federal politician to use the word \"multiculturalism\". Appointed leader following Gough Whitlam's dismissal in 1975, Fraser's multicultural conviction found shape in immigration policy in the post-Vietnam war push to bring refugees to Australia. \"We were also working to get people to understand that the idea and the reality of a multicultural Australia could be an enormous strength to this country, not a weakness,\" Fraser said. \"There is strength in this kind of diversity so long as we understand what it's about.\" He went on to win three further elections before being unseated in 1982, at a time when the country was facing recession, drought and social unrest. Fraser was suffering back pain and was being treated in hospital when he called a snap election, the same day Bob Hawke became opposition leader. But the strategy backfired and he was defeated, eventually retiring from parliament in 1983. Fraser was born into a wealthy Victorian pastoral family and attended various private schools before going on to read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford's Magdalen College in 1952. Upon his return from the UK, he entered politics in 1955, becoming Parliament's youngest MP. In a political career spanning almost 30 years, Fraser advocated for immigration as a means of boosting Australia's population. His greatest asset and supporter was his wife Tamie, whom he married in 1956. Following politics, Fraser formed CARE Australia in 1987, part of the international CARE network of humanitarian organisations and spent many years involved in the organisation. He was a member of the Commonwealth observers group during elections in Pakistan, Tanzania and Bangladesh during the 1990s. In 2000 Fraser was awarded a Human Rights Medal for his contribution to advancing human rights, in Australia and internationally. In recent years, Fraser enthusiastically embraced Twitter, using it to convey his disappointment in topics ranging from Indigenous policy, the UN, refugees and the Iraq war. He was a staunch critic of asylum seeker policy in the Howard years and continued to find himself at odds with the Coalition he had once led. Following Tony Abbott's election as leader in 2009, Fraser quit the Liberal Party after a membership of 60 years. He is survived by his wife Tamie and their four children. Greg O'Shea: Born 1964 \"Greg's happiest years were his last, when he too had created a family in the footsteps of his father.\" When I first met Greg at university, he was valiantly looking for himself. I met his big, happy, loving family \u2014 the family that everyone deserves. Greg often quoted his father Arthur when deciding on how to act on things. Later when Greg had his own family, he too sought to lead by example. Greg's brush with serious illness as a boy imbued him later on with a thirst to live life in a way which we were all attracted to. He he led us to believe, with the sparkle in his eyes that yes, this day was a celebration! And tomorrow too. He laughed often. His warmth filled a room on its own. Quietly charismatic, a gentle and thoughtful man, it's hard to remember anything that wasn't good and honourable about Greg. Perhaps his main fault was that he drank too many cups of tea. In 1990, Greg became a registered landscape architect and established a contemporary practice on the Gold Coast \u2014 The Environmental Design Group. He had a passion for detail and an eye for the quality of things which provide comfort and beauty. He designed towns, furniture, houses and objects. He became the most complete designer I have known and one of Queensland's best. Greg had a passion for travel, adventure and action sports. We rode skateboards, surfboards, skis, sports cars and later, he loved to swing dance and drive Vespas. Once we walked for two weeks with an Aboriginal clan along their dreaming trail on the north coast near Broome. We rode horseback en-route to the ruins of Machu Picchu. Later Greg and Leisa drove Vespas in Europe, vintage cars in Cuba and stayed in Ryokan homes in Japan. Greg and Leisa were inseparable and a more devoted father you would not have met \u2014 his daughters Kitty and Molly filled his life with joy. Greg's happiest years were his last, when he too had created a family in the footsteps of his father. Towering above Is a short bloke Feet a-stance With the smile of a Spanish conquistador Endurance and fortitude clothe him And he wears the sword of perfection In the glory of his eyes Are his three girls Framed by an ocean of blue. \u2014 by John Mongard Godfrey Daniel: Born 1923 \"He was a man of great humour and warmth who loved life.\" In September, we said goodbye to the wonderful Godfrey Daniel. In 92 well-lived years, he made an enormously positive impact on his many friends in Sri Lanka and Australia. He was a man of great humour and warmth who loved life, music, cricket, his church and above all, his family. A loving husband, father, grand-father and great mate to his grandsons. We are so lucky to have been part of his life. We will miss him terribly. \u2014 by Michelle T Carol: Born 1959 \"I will help you choose your Year 6 Dinner Dress. I will enjoy doing all these things for you. I will be missing My Friend - your mother.\" \"My Friend\" she says as she holds my hand. We sit on the sofa talking. For the last time. In my home where we have spent many evenings laughing, drinking, confiding. With our husbands and kids we try to keep some sense of something normal in our voices and our words. When all we are thinking is \"This is the end, this is goodbye forever.\" We keep the chat light - for the sake of our families, but mostly for our daughters. Still in primary school. Still innocent to loss. \"Sophie might help you choose a dress for the Year 6 Dinner?\" My Friend says. Yes I will. I will help you choose a dress. I will take photos of you having fun. I will help you when your skin gets teenagery. I will give you tips on boys. I will show you how to put on mascara. I will kiss your forehead. I will casually mention My Friend to let you know I haven't forgotten. I will help you choose your Year 6 Dinner Dress. I will enjoy doing all these things for you. I will be missing My Friend - your mother. I will be there for you because she can't be. \u2014 by Sophie Alice Catherine Prior: Born 1930 \"I hope she is having a ceilidh with the rest of the Prior clan.\" My Auntie Josie or 'Alice Catherine Prior' was born in Ballyconnell County, Cavan, Ireland on October 31, 1930. She died on February 9. She preferred to be called Josie... my Auntie Josie. Although her story is not for me to tell, I will say she loved life and holidaying with my parents. Auntie Josie worked as a housekeeper in London for a wealthy businessman. She lived in their terrace house. When I was migrating to Australia with my parents and sister (I was 7 years old), we stayed with her before we flew out to Australia. She woke me early one morning and took me downstairs to the basement of the terrace house where there was a bakery. The bakers wore white aprons, white hats and had white flour everywhere. There was a delicious smell of bread and pastries in the air. I remember that we once went to see the Sound of Music movie when it premiered in the 1960s. Josie loved her nieces Elaine and Maureen and knitted toys for us. A rabbit I call Lilly sits in my bookshelf along with a threaded postcard she sent to me from when she holidayed in Spain with my parents in 1966. She was also a mother to many furry Yorkshire terriers. I hope she is having a ceilidh with the rest of the Prior clan. \u2014 by Maureen Leonard Nimoy: Born 1931 \"We return you now to the stars, Leonard. You taught us to 'live longer and prosper'.\" His portrayal of Mr Spock, the half-human, half-Vulcan on Star Trek brought him a worldwide following of fans but there was more to Leonard Nimoy than pointy-ears. In 1975, he wrote a book, I Am Not Spock, attempting to open up space between himself and the character which had captured so many imaginations. Following Star Trek, Nimoy lent his voice to documentaries, video games and television shows. He was also an acclaimed photographer and film director and released photography books and poetry. But it was as a role model for nerds and geeks that he will be best remembered. As Spock, Nimoy was calm under pressure with a logical response always at the ready. The fans, known as 'Trekkies' emulated his signature salute and blessing: \"Live long and Co-star George Takei, who played Mr Sulu said: \"We return you now to the stars, Leonard. You taught us to 'live long and prosper', and you indeed did, friend.\" \"I shall miss you in so many, many ways.\" Leonard Simon Nimoy was born in Boston, USA, the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants. He began acting in local theatre at the age of eight and in 1949, after taking an acting course, he travelled to Hollywood. However, he did not land small roles until 1951; one role was an an alien invader in Zombies of the Stratosphere. Nimoy joined the US Army and served for two years and after discharged, returned to California where he worked as a taxi driver and theatre usher while studying acting. His big break came in 1966 when he was cast as the lone alien on the starship Enterprise. \"Long before being nerdy was cool, there was Leonard Nimoy,\" President Obama said. Nimoy had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and [died on February 27 in California](/news/2015-02-28/star-treks-mr-spock-leonard-nimoy-dies-at-83/6270602). \"I quit smoking 30 years ago. Not soon enough. Grandpa says, quit now,\" he tweeted to his 810,000 followers. Mason Tsai: Born 2009 \"Only six years old and yet, so many [stories] to remember and tell!\" He is a loving, kind, smart, humour and bravest little boy who has been taken away from DIPG! We had wonderful six years memories together. The way he talk, eat, laugh, sing, walk, hug and play i-pad will never be taken away! He never gets angry on anything. He still think for others when he is not so mobilised. He even make joke of himself when he is unable to wee and talk properly. He helped his little sister to brush her teeth, he asked permission on doing or eating everything. He always have the good habit of turning off everything, he wouldn't throw away any broken toys because he still love them... There are so many things that he surprise us every single day. He is my sweetest and most thoughtful little boy in the world as he even gave us a smile face with his dimple after he left us. Although, I held him in my arm when both his birth and death. Nevertheless, we know he is closer then what we think he is, because we love him more than he knows! Our love towards him will live on in our heart until we meet again! \u2014 by Evawufang Warren Brettschneider: Born 1965 \"At the mere age of thirteen my brother was diagnosed with a brain tumour, but that never stopped him.\" My brother, my hero. At the mere age of thirteen my brother was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He was a young man full of life and cheek, always into mischief, such a vibrant person. His goals in life were to play first grade rugby league and join the army \u2014 two things he was never able to do. My brother's tumour grew so fast and within days of being diagnosed, it was almost too large to be operated on. He came home for Christmas, frail, with the expectation of death. He was a fighter, my brother, and hung on for another thirty-three years. His life was never the same as we knew it, but that didn't stop him from trying. Over the years, so many complications presented themselves; he never complained, he never gave up. Whenever anything was happening, he was always in the thick of it. Never wanting to miss a moment and always embracing life. Even as his life deteriorated, his will to live remained strong \u2014 a smile forever etched upon his face, and love exuberating from his heart. I don't ever remember him complaining or questioning, \"Why me?\" He just tried to live his life the very best way that he could. In our youth he was my best buddy and not a day goes by that I don't think of him. He was an angel, selfless and adorable. The number of people that his generosity touched and the numerous friends that he had was a testament of his character \u2014 so evident in the attendance at his funeral. Rest in peace little brother. You will always be my hero. \u2014 by Vickie Brettschneider Jackie Collins: Born 1937 \"If anything, my characters are toned down \u2014 the truth is much more bizarre.\" She was the author of more than 30 raunchy novels featuring strong women and lustful men with power, sex and revenge on their minds. Jackie Collins hit upon her recipe for success early with her first novel, The World is Full of Married Men, which fellow author Barbara Cartland deemed to be \"filthy and disgusting\". Every one of her 32 books made it to the New York Times' bestseller lists and eight were adapted for film or television mini-series, including Hollywood Wives and The Bitch. Collins said she wrote about \"real people in disguise.\" \"If anything, my characters are toned down \u2014 the truth is much more bizarre,\" she wrote on her website. Jacqueline Jill Collins, [who died on September 19](/news/2015-09-20/best-selling-author-jackie-collins-dies-aged-77/6789840), was born in north-west London and at age nine, began writing stories which were illustrated by her older sister Joan. At school, she was naughty and regularly skipped classes, with forged parental notes. She wrote and sold dirty limericks to other students but it was after being caught smoking behind a tree that she was expelled. Her father, a variety agent, encouraged her to give up on her idea of becoming a journalist and suggested she become an actress instead. She was duly shipped off to Beverly Hills to join her sister Joan and claimed that within days of her arrival, she was seduced by Marlon Brando. It proved the ideal breeding ground for a fertile imagination and soon Jackie was writing her steamy \"bonkbusters\" to much acclaim. \"My heroines kick ass. They don't get their asses kicked,\" Collins said of her female characters. In 1998, Collins secured the largest advance in American book publishing, $US10 million for three novels. Her first marriage, to a drug addicted, manic depressive ended after the birth of a daughter and not long after, her first book was published. She married again and had two daughters with Oscar Lerman, a marriage lasting 27 years until his death in 1992. Collins collaborated for the first time with her actress sister in 1978 on the film version of The Stud but it was a box office failure. Joan Collins was as shocked as anyone at her sister's death. Despite having been diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago, Collins kept the news to herself, only telling her family two weeks prior to her death. Kim Piddington: Born 1960 \"Feral tracker,\" as Kim called himself. \"An extraordinary photographer and bushman..\" Truth is, I didn't really know him all that well, having only met a very few times in person, but Kim's death earlier this year left a big hole in my heart, and that of many who had come to know him over the course of his years in Tibooburra. I met him through a Facebook page I administer, about the Corner Country, and through which I share images and stories of our part of the world to the bigger world. Kim's nature photography caught my attention, and we became friends \u2014 good friends. His love of the natural and human history of the Corner Country drove so much of what he did, and what we shared. His photographic skills had no challenger in this neck of the woods and he encouraged, supported and advised me always. I learned so much from this man. Long telephone conversations, usually as I was preparing dinner, were commonplace and of course, we solved not only problems of our local area, but the entire world. So often today, as I continue to photograph wildlife in our area, I think of Kim. The Wedge-tailed eagle that sits alongside the road bloated, or the bustard in tall grasses, or the welcome swallows that I try to capture in flight. Kim's laughter rings in my ears at the sheer challenge of such a venture and encourages me still. Rest easy Kim... you are missed but not forgotten. \u2014 by Ruth Sandow Nathanial (Natty) Reece Guymer: Born 1988 \"Natty was a great man of big things. Big laugh, big smile and a big heart. I will love you forever my love.\" Natty was a great man of big things. Big laugh, big smile and a big heart. He was born on the July 1, 1988. Known as Natty by his close family, Nate by friends he was never really called Nathanial. The best way to describe Natty is that he was everything big \u2014 very tall like his cousins and he had a big laugh, a big smile and a big heart. Natty was so caring and I was lucky enough to know his gentler side. He worked extremely hard at his job and inside the gym; he just loved the gym. I will always remember that he would call me everyday on his way home from work and make me laugh so hard, cracking jokes about his day and singing songs to make me laugh. I loved him very very much and miss him everyday. I'll always remember the first time Natty said 'I love you'. He asked me if I loved him and I said, 'Yes, since the first day I met you'. Natty said, 'Good 'cause I love you too; you have my heart always and forever'. I will love you forever, my love. \u2014 by Maddy Michael Stimpson: Born 1973 \"Left behind six children, five stepchildren, a wife. And a life.\" Mike was firstly a brewer, a maker of fine beers. Passionate about the quality and taste. It occupied night and day for him. Wife and kids came second. And now we have to survive without him. Without his beer. Without his stories. Lectures. Words of wisdom that even he struggled to live up to. Integrity was his favourite word. He had such high expectations of himself, and was his harshest critic, and his own worst enemy. He wanted so much for his children, and they rebelled against it. I hope one day they see his love of them for what it was. Love. Guidance. Care. His youngest son and daughter wish they were worth staying for, but that is my job now. Mike passed, tragically taking his own life, on Saturday July 25. His last known words were: \"I will always be there for you.\" Perhaps he needed to say \"I need you here for me.\" I am sorry I couldn't help, and we ended up so far apart. It wasn't what I wanted. But you kept building walls. I think they were supposed to protect, but they ended up isolating. You were always loved, and always will be. Forever and always.

They threw away the mould when they made him! Bob was born in Melbourne, Victoria on November 3, 1926. To his friends he was affectionately known as 'Bobby'. He was a devoted husband, loving father, a humble friend and a passionate musician. Ross and I met Bob at the Grand Hotel in Bundaberg in the late 1970s. He was tapping away on his drums with a microphone in hand, his soft tuneful voice audible above the jazz band of a saxophone, trombone, and double base. After Bob and Betty moved to Bundaberg with their three children, Bob worked at Coles and the sugar mill before purchasing the Pandanus Motel at Bargara. Memorable parties were shared with the Smiths. Dinner and fancy dress parties. Bob loved to cook. On one occasion he was barbecuing chicken. The coals went out. Bob poured kerosene on them, and bingo, they ignited, burning the chicken with a kerosene flavour. He was then known as Kerosene Bob. Stories and jokes. Everyone loved the way he told them. A keen golfer was Bob. No mucking about with lining up, or hesitation in selecting a club. Bingo; he was always on the fairway and achieved a good score. Painting was another hobby. Not houses, but jazz musicians. Apart from anniversaries and birthdays, Bob organised gatherings with music friends at his home. All the jazz musicians in town were invited. There was music, singing, dancing and eating into the wee small hours. He played with jazz friends at various venues in Bundaberg. The last time Bobby played the drums was at his wedding anniversary party. He played Golden Wedding, a difficult piece. Afterwards I asked 'How did that feel Bobby?' 'My wrists ache', was his reply. Bobby lost his battle with cancer on July 24. He will be remembered by many people in Bundaberg, particularly by his good friends and the jazz boys. He was a hale fellow, well met. Rest In Peace my dear friend. \u2014 by Margaret Harris Geoffrey Thomas Simpson: Born 1950 \"He was strong, a comic, a terrible punter, a lover of the footy and a good golfer. A proud family man.\" He fought as long and as hard as he could, but in March this year, Geoffrey lost his seven-year battle with melanoma. Dad was and remains to this day, the King of Carp Street. He owned a fruit shop in Bega NSW called the Fruit Connection, his voice echoing down the street towards the \"Rec\" yelling out \"Bananas, Apples, Mangoes\"! It would draw a crowd. You would have thought you were standing in the middle of the Flemington Fruit Market. He was strong, a comic, a terrible punter, a lover of the footy and a good golfer. A proud family man. A life lived well but certainly not long enough for his two girls, his two baby grandsons and his beloved wife. Until we meet again Pa xx \u2014 by Annie David Vincent McIvor: Born1969 \"Often people touch our lives and we don't even know it. David was one of these people.\" Always a little shy, kind, and with a hint of dry humour, David filled our lives with joy. From around 18, when the schizophrenia set in, David went through what I think of as the dark years. They were very difficult for him and for us, and lasted for the duration of his 20s and for some of his 30s. However, it was when he was almost on death's door and came back to Mum in North Queensland that his life started to change. Mum's care for him for more than 10 years gave him a chance at life he may not have had. Sadly, in April 2015, he was diagnosed with [Merkel Cell Carcinoma](http://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/hp/merkel-cell-treatment-pdq). This aggressive skin cancer saw him deteriorate quickly. The photo that accompanies this story is not his best, but it is real. It was taken on the night of his 46th birthday on June 27, 2015 in Mareeba. We all flew in from various parts and had a cake and a BBQ with a small group of friends for him. It was bitter-sweet. David died just three weeks after his birthday in Cairns Base Hospital. He peacefully passed away with Mum at his side. We realised, when he passed, how many lives he had touched, especially for those friends close to Mum who shared in caring for him or even having a chat with him when he would go for his daily walks to St Thomas' Catholic Church. It is with great sorrow and sadness I saw you pass so soon. I knew you had to go, but I wished you hadn't gone so soon. I wish you had stayed a little longer. \u2014 by Kerree McIvor Terrence Josiah Williams: Born 1929 \"He sang show tunes to his wife, loved Mickey Mouse, ice-cream and boating on the Mississippi River.\" My Uncle Terry is holding his youngest grandchild in this photo, taken a few years ago, just after my dad, his brother, died. Uncle Terentius (a nickname of his choosing) and dad grew up during the Depression in a tiny town in Kansas, smack bang in the middle of America. But for a guy from the dust bowl, Terry was so worldly, so stylish, so erudite and knowledgeable. With my own dad unwell and absent emotionally, Terry became a father figure to me as I grew. It was a role thrust upon him but I think he liked the change a girl brought into his life, with three sons of his own. [I travelled to Minnesota for his funeral](http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/94879/?fullname=terrence-josiah-williams) in August and it was one of the best days of my life. I learned so much more about him and felt closer to him than almost ever before. And it was there that I learned how much he had treasured being my pseudo-dad and how proud of me he was. I am really missing him. \u2014 by Jen King Dr Michael John Richmond: Born 1937 \"A diagnostic doctor beyond compare with a massive heart and a zest for life.\" Our father was born in Leeds in the UK where he earned his medical degree. In 1965 he moved to Sydney where he quickly met and married our mother. Despite divorcing 20 years later, they remained close friends and he cared for both her and our step-father medically, right to the end. Dad re-married and with Margaret, found true happiness. He lived for medicine, working right up to the time he was admitted to hospital for pneumonia to which he ultimately succumbed. He was respected and indeed, revered, as a doctor with hundreds of patients relying on his unfailing ability to tirelessly search until he found the cause of their symptoms. Sharing his mobile number with patients, and thus his weekends, was something he did naturally. In recent years dad welcomed his eldest grandson into his home to live with him and Margaret, revelling in the youthful exuberance of Oskar and his teenage friends. An incredibly loving, supportive and generous husband, father and grandfather. Loved by so many, missed by so many more. \u2014 by Samantha Harrington Bob Stone: Born 1925 \"A tribute to my precious grandfather Bob Stone who passed away this year aged 90.\" Once, when I lived in the desert, a beautiful old man passed away. The sky went black and a wild storm visited us that night. Today as I drove to work, it was hard to watch the road as the sky took my eye at every direction. The clouds seemed alive and the sun touched the hills taking my breath away. When I was 21, while staying with Granny and Bob, Bob had a turn and we had to call an ambulance. I was scared. He was laying in his bed and he smiled and reached for my hand. I held it for a moment then pulled it away. I don't know why I pulled away that day but I promised myself I would never pull away again. On Monday I had the chance to hold his warm hand again. Those hands that served tennis balls, hammered nails, threw fleeces, carried calves, manipulated machinery, held my babies, shook hands with my friends, directed sheep dogs, marked footballs, worked the warship and lifted me as a child. I didn't let go this time. The sheep are grazing, the ship is docked, the dogs are kenneled, we are grown and we will be sharing his story with our big-eyed children until we are the old people. My last old person left the world today and he decorated the sky for us on the way. I am blessed to have known, loved and to have been known and loved by my precious Gran-daddy Bob. \u2014 by Donna Loves Life Lynne Painter: Born 1954 \"Mum's life had become one of paradoxes. She was so happy, yet so sad. So loud, yet so quiet. So open and transparent, yet so secretive.\" Our family deals with serious situations with humour but this story is a little more on the serious side. In our family, any serious illness or disease is pre-faced with the word 'THE'... In recent times, Mum had 'THE' cancer and 'THE' depression. Mum beat the cancer and it was the depression that she had to fight with the hardest. I texted mum recently to check how she was going. She responded: \"Very average, still fighting the black dog, but Lucy is ok\". Lucy was her black Dachshund. So, Mum had a Black Dog. The Black Dog had been around for a while. Sometimes it was lurking in the distance and sometimes it was right beside her. Recently, it was as if it was sitting on her head, blocking her vision. Mum's life had become one of paradoxes. She was so happy, yet so sad. So loud, yet so quiet. So open and transparent, yet so secretive. So courageous, yet so vulnerable. So confident and yet so insecure. All of those strengths are the real Lynnie, and all of those weaknesses, or whatever you want to call them, they are not Lynnie, they were simply the strengths of the Black Dog. I don't have a Black Dog, but I saw Mum's Black Dog, and I didn't like what I saw. I know enough about her illness to know that the Black Dog must be taken seriously. It must not be ignored, nor judged. The Black Dog must be respected, because it will command respect whether or not you want to give it. Mum silenced the Black Dog, and she is now in peace. But the Black Dog did not win as it can't take our memories of the real Lynnie. Mum loved leopard print, so in the spirit of our family humour, Lynnie left this world in a leopard print coffin.

She gave up everything for her kids.\" Mum was always caring for someone. When my brother Stephen and I were little, she was very involved with our activities, and encouraged a love of reading and knitting. She often sat with her friends on the floor for hours trying to untangle an errant ball of wool. She also loved crochet, needlework, wool spinning, folk art and sports - at one stage she even coached Stephen's soccer team. Even when we were still babies, we regularly went sailing and Mum spent a lot of time with the yacht club community where she would knit jumpers for the men who sailed offshore. Mum would sew our clothes, even making wedding dresses for myself and my sister-in-law Fiona, and beautiful little dresses for her granddaughters. Mum was always caring for someone, spending as much time as she could with her own mother as she aged and became unwell. She also looked after her friends when they became unwell, often sitting day after day at the hospital with her friend Helen, often not even speaking, but just being there with her. And when we had our own children, she was there caring for us, taking weeks off work to help when new babies arrived into the family. She was always giving of herself and never, ever complained. Mum welcomed into her home many Japanese and Korean students, showing them our country and cultures, and us kids used to take them aside and teach them all the swear words. As time went by, and her illness progressed, she moved into Calvary. She wasn't happy about this, but as usual, never complained. The nurses got to know and love her as a beautiful lady who never complained and who read everything she could \u2014 books, magazines and newspapers. I've spent many years thinking that I am the exact opposite of her, only to realise in recent days that I am almost a carbon copy. I am the way I am because of you. \u2014 by Katrina Kadek: Born 2010 \"Kadek's condition was called Tetralogy of Fallot, meaning four problems with her heart.\" I met Kadek in Bali with her mother Niki who was bathing her in a little tub. Looking back now on the photographs, Kadek had blue lips, an indicator of heart problems they should have realised at birth. Kadek's condition was called [Tetralogy of Fallot](http://www.rch.org.au/cardiology/heart_defects/Fallots_Tetralogy/), meaning four problems with her heart. Years later, at a hospital waiting for Kadek, a doctor told me how, when midwives cut the cord too early, the heart doesn't form properly. It needs a few beats outside the womb with the cord intact to make the heart complete. Until that moment it has a hole, and if the cord is cut too soon the hole stays open. He told me it happens every day in Indonesia; such a simple mistake that no doubt causes so much anguish and pain. Kadek died in her mother's arms in the village of Munti Gunung. They took me to pay last respects to Kadek on the side of the hill just up the road from her home. They'd put her little body in a cavity with a rock on top to stop the creatures etc. Every little thing Kadek owned, liked, loved, was on the grave. They kept nothing but her birth certificate on the wall at home. I gave Kadek a little token, just a gift from another that meant a lot to me. It was all I could do, but I'm helping Niki, Wayan and their son Putu by sending money regularly so Putu can stay at school. The thing is, even though Munti Gunung is one of the poorest villages in Bali, it's still so far ahead of other places, like Lombok and a thousand other islands that are even poorer, living in the dirt. However, life is great in these places while you're well. Kids are still happy with a stick and a wheel, and some food in their belly. I just want Australia to know, I want Indonesia to know, that ordinary people like me care and want to help. I just want the world to know about Kadek \u2014 a beautiful young girl who deserved better. \u2014 by Michael Bienke Sue Buer: Born 1949 \"Her only regret was she couldn't have a Viking funeral.\" Death of a shipmate. There was serenity towards the end as if she were awaiting the tea trolley. The bills had been paid, the will revised and deposited with the Trustee. Her one irritation was her son and his ever-present smart phone. She was nearly bald from the chemo and wore a beanie to conceal it. Her complexion, once clear and ruddy, was now mottled. Cleanliness, always a concern, became an obsession and she dressed neatly as always (see photo and note the sensible hat). What little strength she had, she spent running the vacuum cleaner over the carpet, washing dishes and scrubbing out the bathroom. Not an easy person to live with, her only companions were a couple of mongrel dogs. Her main task each morning was to walk the dogs. It was proof she was still alive but it became more difficult as she grew weaker. One day, one of the dogs chasing a bird knocked her over and she lay in the gutter struggling to get up until a passer-by helped her back home. She never surrendered to death; rather, she embraced it. She had led a full life and now it was over and she had no regrets, or only a few. She breathed her last with a smile on her face gazing at the photo of herself 20 years before, clinging to the yardarm of a square rigged sailing ship. \u2014 by Jabiru Aaron Joseph Howe: Born 1979 \"My brother was headstrong and opinionated but on the flip side, he had a huge heart and massive smile.\" Where do you start when a life has ended? We lost Aaron only three months ago today. It was sudden, it was unexpected and it has been utterly heart breaking. He was my only sibling, my parents' only son. My brother moved to the beat of his own drum. He was headstrong, opinionated and sometimes cocky but on the flip side, he had a huge heart, a massive smile and laugh and an enormous capacity to love. Aaron became a dad for the first time a little over two years ago. I saw another side to my brother, an even deeper capacity to love. He may not have been a perfect dad but my God, did he love that child. As I am sure with most people who have lost someone they love this year, or at anytime, there is an avalanche of feelings, memories and stories. My parents and I have been almost compelled to talk about him, to continue speaking his name. It reminds us of what we had and who he was but also, gradually chips away at the feeling of unreality, reminds us that we will never see him again or hear that big, loud voice. The world feels far too quiet now without him in it.... Aaron was larger than life. The space left now he is gone feels like it can never be filled. Be at peace little brother. Know that we love you, know that you will never be forgotten and know that we will be there to love and support your darling son. Love always, your Sissy xxx \u2014 by Cookie Cam Abood: Born 1943 \"He was one of the most gentle, genuine, lovely souls.\" I could not believe what I was reading! I was casually scrolling through Facebook two weeks ago, when I came across a post from The Bass Coast Police in South Gippsland. With fitting words, they were respectfully honouring their Justice of the Peace, who had passed away after a short illness. To my complete, overwhelming shock, I realised this wonderful man was my marriage celebrant and had joined my husband and I in matrimony in 2012 on a beautiful summer's evening at Venus Bay beach. I remember Cam saying, during his many years as a celebrant, it was the largest wedding crowd he had ever spoken in front of \u2014 and he managed it beautifully. I really know very little about this inspiring man, except that he was one of the most gentle, genuine, lovely souls I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Through his approachable, thoughtful, kind, professional manner, my husband and I were made to feel like our wedding ceremony was the most special and important Cam had ever performed, as would have been the case with all his many happy customers! It was such a pleasure meeting this unique man and I will continue to cherish Cam's memory, not only because he lovingly played a significant role on our wedding day, but because it's not often you meet people like Cam in life. A true gentleman, who sadly passed away too soon, yet has left behind a wonderful legacy. I know for certain this man will not be forgotten in a hurry. May the Angels hold Cam in their arms now and always.... \u2014 by Camilla Hullick Pam Skelton: Born 1938 \"My mum was the first woman to be ordained as a priest in Scotland.\" This was taken seven months before my mum died; it's us drinking gin and tonic on the first-class train to London. We travelled to London from Edinburgh for a march and celebration of 20 years of women's ordination in the UK. My mum was the first woman to be ordained as a priest in Scotland and despite having had a stroke a year before, she was determined to go down to celebrate. I flew over from Sydney to go with her and it was one of the most proud moments of my life. Me, my dad, brother and my niece and nephew were there. It was a special special time. We had just been drinking gin and tonics in the first-class train carriage from Edinburgh to London. Mum was happy, fun, cheeky, and excited. She always sought the 'sparks' in life and over those days, they were everywhere. We pushed her in a wheelchair from Westminster Abbey to St Paul's Cathedral. The women who had been ordained all started to process in together. Mum said it was the first time she had felt validated in her role and everyone cheered as she, with many others, came into St Pauls Cathedral. The whole place erupted. It was a beautiful, joyous few days and I'm so glad she was still alive to have that. \u2014 by Liz Skelton Billy Williams: Born 1961 \"He was 'Backhoe Williams's from Killarney' to most; solid-built, noisy and hardworking, a loving husband and father.\" He was 'Backhoe Bill' or 'Bill Killarney' to most; solid-built, noisy and hardworking, a loving and much-loved husband and father. Billy and I were often mistaken for twins for we were fifth and sixth-born of eight siblings and were alike in looks and character. But, as he liked to point out now and then, he WAS 19 months older. Billy was just 52 years of age when cancer robbed us of him this year, but I like this photo taken at Christmas about 1969 as a reminder we still each have a child-self, deserving of surprise, amazement and wonder and which death's melancholy should never take from us. There were plenty of surprises the day this photo was taken. Our eldest brother Peter had swapped 'round presents after Santa had been, and I woke up all excited to find I had a you-beaut cowboy outfit and a little brother horrified with a new 'girly' doll. The problem with being a 'girl' in the midst of four brothers is that you grow up thinking you can be one of them. It was Billy who organised the swapping back of misplaced Santa presents and obtained for me an afternoon's use of an Indian-style feathered headwear from my doll-wielding brother. Negotiation always seemed to come easier to Billy with his inherent sense of fairness, and beneath the bluff exterior he was gentle-natured and a bit shy although he had a cheeky streak. Our parents named him William Robert Williams after our paternal grandfather 'Bob' Williams (William Robert Williams of Apollo Bay) and maternal grandfather William 'Bill' Willis, of Warrnambool. My children knew him as 'Big Bill', to distinguish him from his nephew of the same name. When it came to career choices, Billy had a clear-cut vision like our father \u2014 as long as work involved excavators and trucks he was happy as the proverbial pig in a poke. Billy's wife and two sons were his whole world, but his beloved machinery ran a close second. Seven-day weeks and twelve-hour days were Billy's work norms, and he stuck by his word and his work. The rare eclipse of the sun that hovered over Warrnambool on the morning of Billy's death on the January 20 seemed so fitting for the passing of this sunny-natured, all-eclipsing character who is our brother Billy. And it was no surprise over a 1,000 people squeezed in to attend his funeral, for though Billy bluffed his way through adulthood as a take-no-hostages type of character, the immense number of his friends both knew and were testimony to the true character and nature of Billy the Kid. \u2014 by Jenny Williams Fawcett Jean Haynes: Born 1922 \"As we farewelled you Nanny, we mused about one last Manly ferry ride. You loved the ferry. Especially when it was rough.\" Your chapter has closed, but your story continues. You lived to see three generations born, and you live on in each on of us. As we farewelled you this week, we mused about one last Manly ferry ride. You loved the ferry. Especially when it was rough. Sydney was a centrepiece to your life. The harbour was a constant background. You were one of the first to walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge when it opened in 1932. You sheltered with your family under the kitchen table during the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942. You used to ride a bus into the city, over the bridge, to go to work near Circular Quay. You used to point out the building you worked in to us as we caught the 288 [bus] into town. You have been a constant in our lives. You lived so long, we started to think you were immortal. You were so independent, and the end really began when you moved into the hostel. You weren't there very long. I am so grateful for your last Sunday. We all came to be with you, we sang and held your hand. Time stood still, as you stood between this world and the next, quietly saying farewell. I am going to miss you so much. You were great Nanny. \u2014 by Catherine Bell Rosalind Jackson: Born 1939 \"Mum believed in being positive as this was the best way to live. Her smile was infectious.\" Mum was always a positive person; she never said a bad word about anyone, ever. She believed in being positive as this was the best way to live. Her smile was infectious. This photo is after 30 hours on a plane after a holiday to the UK. Even with jet lag she could crack a beautiful smile!! She lived with dementia for the last four years of her wonderful and happy life right until the day she left out earth on the September 19. I learnt so much from her and miss her dearly xxx \u2014 by Sarahj Jacqueline Britton: Born 1981 \"Jacqueline tragically lost her life in a motor vehicle accident in February.\" Jacqui's wild ride was cut short at the beginning of 2015 in a single motor vehicle accident. She died immediately, but her beautiful babies were trapped in the car with her for nearly nine hours. The car was over an embankment and I had driven past four times that day, unbeknownst they were there. Jacq was the life of the party. There were always wild, fun plans in place when she was around. She was a great sister and friend and I miss her a thousand times a day. Her babies were like my babies, I adored them. Unfortunately, their father moved on quickly and in doing so, moved them away to Queensland. She could be the hardest person to get along with and very set in her ways, but to those who were friends with her, she was amazing. I hope her beautiful girls grow up with half as much spunk as she had. She was the boss of the family, and we are all quite lost without her. Our lives were mapped out; we would raise the kids as close cousins then spend our golden years cruising. Funny how things change. I'm sure she's watching over us. I don't understand how a young mother can be ripped from her babies, but there must be some kind of plan! I love you sister. \u2014 by Emma78 Juozas (Joe) Girdauskas: Born 1921 \"Life for Joe here has ended but now, according to his great grandson, he earned his 'angel's wings'.\" Dad was born May 8, 1921 in the small village of Rudziu, Lithuania, the fourth child of Petronela and Kajetonas Girdauskas, poor farmers who raised eight children. There was nothing extraordinary about our dad, except like so many others of his generation, he experienced the torment of war and painful separation from loved ones. He and his brother Justinas were taken by the Nazis from their family and imprisoned for a period of time during the war. He would never see his parents again although after a 50-year period of absence he returned to Lithuania in 1995 for a short period of six weeks. Joe arrived in Australia (to Burnie, Tasmania) in 1950 where he eventually married our mother Catharina Redeker. During his active and working life, he worked as a carpenter and joiner, with Jennings, Kirpatrick's Joinery and for most of his working life, at APPM Burnie. When he retired, he enjoyed fishing at Arthurs Lake, in Tasmania's central highlands. Life was tough for our dad but he made the most of his long life. He passed away in the early hours on Sunday March 29. A life that left no stone unturned. Rest in Peace dad - we love you! \u2014 by JohnG Alan Bond: Born 1938 \"I wanted to have 1 million pounds by the time I was 21. And I set out to do that.\" He was the man who wrenched the America's Cup from the United States for the first time in the yacht race's 132-year history. That is how one generation of Australians remember Alan Bond. Another generation will remember him as bankrupt jailbird and fraudster. Whichever way he is remembered, there is no denying the controversial tycoon put Australia \u2014 and The Boxing Kangaroo \u2014 onto the world stage. [There is a lot to know about Bond](/news/2015-06-05/alan-bond-10-things-you-need-to-know/6520736), the financial force behind the yachting syndicate which won the prestigious America's Cup in 1983. Following the shock victory, then-prime minister Bob Hawke declared any boss who did not give their employees the day off was \"a bum\". For a time, Bond, accompanied by his red-haired wife Eileen, could do no wrong in the country's eyes. But by 1992, he was declared bankrupt to the tune of $622 million, still the second largest personal bankruptcy in history. He was jailed that year for the first time, and subsequently spent time behind bars over the purchase of a French impressionist painting and for siphoning off funds in what was the country's biggest corporate fraud. \"I found in prison that I had more time to read the Bible, I had more time to contemplate life, and more time to look upon my fellow man,\" [Bond said of his time in jail](/news/2015-06-05/alan-bond-dies-in-perth-after-heart-surgery-complications/6520630). Bond was born in London and emigrated with his family aged 12, settling in Fremantle, Western Australia. He made his money in property developing, brewing, gold mining, television and founded Bond University on the Gold Coast of Queensland. Bond overcame his criminal past to rebuilt his fortune and in 2008, BRW estimated his wealth to be $265 million. He and his first wife divorced in 1992 and in 1995 he married Diana Bliss, who took her own life in 2012. Alan Bond died on June 5 following heart surgery. Audrey Grace Cox: Born 1932 \"A much loved Mum and very dear friend to many. She lived life to the fullest. Taken too soon and unexpectedly. Missed greatly by all.\" What a woman Audrey was. She was a truly great Mum and equally great friend. She trained and then taught as a domestic home science teacher in the early 1950s. After raising five children, she went back to study and gained her Bachelor of Social Work in the mid 1970s. She loved her work and even after retiring she was always available to advise anyone who asked. Audrey loved her four grandchildren with a passion and they equally returned that love. She lived life to the full and was always learning new hobbies such as picture framing, stamping, decoupage, and her lasting love, quilting!! She loved quilting so much that so many of her family and friends have not one quilt but two or even three. When asked who the next project was for she would often answer, 'Oh the cupboard'. You should have seen the cupboard!!! In March Mum broke her hip after falling over her own feet as she left her weekly Tai Chi lesson. When I got to the hospital, she was lying in emergency all cheerful saying 'I haven't got time for this. I've got too much to do'. The operation was successful and after she returned home and was allowed to drive again, she was again 'oot 'n aboot'. Unfortunately, five months after the hip replacement she had a pulmonary embolism which claimed her life instantly. Her ashes were scattered in early December at Mooloolaba Spit where she loved to sunbake. She was a sunny bunny all her life. Audrey/Mum is so very much missed by all her family and friends. At times we still don't believe that it has happened. We will always love her. \u2014 by Lyn Cox Garry Paul Meister: Born 1955 \"Dad had a love of music, all kinds of music. He built giant black book cases to house his extensive record collection.\" The shelves juxtaposed Led Zeppelin albums with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. After a long shift at work, he would put a record on and doze on the lounge. We all knew this was his time and to leave him in peace. But as a small child, I missed him while he was on shift work and I would want to tell him about my day, so I would sneak in when Mum wasn't watching. No matter how exhausted he was, he would always listen and he would sit me on his knee and hold my hands around his drum sticks, while we drummed along with the music on the coffee table. On April 2, Dad passed away after a four-year battle with cancer. In the end, he was surrounded by his wife of 40 years, his nine kids and his 10 grandchildren who loved him more than we could ever express. In the end he won. \u2014 by Hyde88 Mick Harkin: Born 1933 \"Much loved member of the Sunraysia U3A writing for pleasure group.\" Mick Harkin has been a long-term member of U3A (University of the Third Age) Sunraysia's Writing for Pleasure group. My personal knowledge suggests a total of more than 10 years. In that time he has produced scores of poems, short stories and essays, most of them informed by his long and interesting life experiences in various regions of country Victoria. His writings typically displayed a genuine interest in people of all walks of life, from swagmen and labourers to doctors, journalists, teachers and priests and his poetry was notable for a well developed use of rhyme. He always displayed a robust sense of humour, and he had little time for the \"academic snobbery\" he saw in some modern writing. We always found his work enjoyable and worthwhile. After a lengthy period of deteriorating health, Mick passed away in November, aged 82 years. We will miss him. \u2014 by John Leary Andrew Chan: Born 1984 \"I trust that this [death] isn't God's divine plan for me, and he has a better hope and plan for my life.\" Like his co-sentenced, Myuran Sukumaran, Andrew Chan grew up in Sydney's west, even attending the same high school, although a few years apart. At school, Chan was a bit of a joker who loved sport, but \u2014 according to one obituary \u2014 was also known as a bully, a quality he took with him to Indonesia but which faded as he faced his fate. He and Sukumaran, and seven others, collectively known as the Bali Nine, were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for attempting to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin out of the country. Together with Sukumaran, Chan was sentenced to [death by firing squad and died on April 29](/news/2015-04-29/andrew-chan-and-myuran-sukumaran-executed/6426654). He was born in 1984, the youngest child of Chinese migrants who ran restaurants. He left school in year 10 and worked as a part-time cook but [admitted he had no direction and had fallen into the drug scene](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/obituary-andrew-chan-19842015-20150428-1muvpu.html). Chan was soon smuggling drugs in to Australia and was one of the organisers behind the failed Bali Nine mission. Once in Kerobokan prison, Chan, an atheist before his arrest, took a theology course and studied to become a pastor. He ran the English language church services within the jail and said his faith helped him cope with life in jail. Together with Sukumaran, the men established a drug rehabilitation program for the other prisoners. Chan was ordained as a Christian minister in February and married fellow pastor Febyanti Herewila in the prison chapel just after he received formal notice of his imminent execution. Leo Cussen: Born 1959 \"What struck me on first meeting him was his eyes, and his character.\" I first met Leo in 2007, volunteering at Arts Project Australia, a studio and gallery that supports artists with intellectual disabilities based in Northcote, Melbourne. Leo had worked in the studio for years and he'd been exhibiting since 1998, including internationally and at the National Gallery in Canberra. Initially, I had no idea how successful his career was. What struck me on first meeting him was his eyes, and his character. Leo's friendly \u2014 if at times, brusque \u2014 manner was infectious, direct and often humorous and it would draw you in to whatever subject Leo had decided to talk about. He had specific questions with specific answers on rotation, always about classic TV shows like M.A.S.H, I Dream of Jeannie or Dr Who (all central themes of his art practice). Over the years, like all of Leo's friends, I gained knowledge on his favourite subjects and knew most of the answers to his questions, but much fun could be had by answering one of Leo's questions wrong on purpose. Leo would find this annoying and hilarious at once, making him laugh, which always made me laugh. He was so much fun to be around. Leo called all men 'boss' and all the women 'girl' so I felt very pleased when, after a couple of years, he started calling me by my first name. It felt like I had been granted access into Leo's special club. Leo's death in May was sudden and sad. The last time I saw him was at our local supermarket one evening. I was on my way to the checkout when I spied Leo walking towards me. \"Hi James\", he said, offering me a handshake. \"Hi Leo, what are you shopping for, tonight?\" I enquired. \"Chocolate!\" he replied. And with that he resumed his journey to the chocolate aisle. I was at the checkout and glanced back to observe Leo, the flat cap on his head jutting forward as he leaned in to stare intently at the bars of chocolate, with his hands clasped together behind his back. Of course, I didn't realise this would be the last time I would see Leo, but that brief last encounter was, in many ways, perfect. In 2006 [ABC Sunday Arts focussed a program on Leo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9UCQiyLuNA). \u2014 by James McDonald Bryan Williams: Born 1964 \"When I look at my siblings and the people we are and becoming, I feel proud to be a part of my dad's legacy.\" In 2010, I was running a cooking program for people at the Mental Health Association of Central Australia, affectionately termed 'Macca' (MHACA) by it's participants and staff. My father lived out bush on a community and was in town for some reason or another. I knew that he was coming and so had asked my supervisor at MHACA if my Dad could come to the BBQ that I had incorporated once a month into a cooking program for the staff and clients. I wanted to share a part of my life that I was successful in, with him. We had what I thought to be, a brilliant relationship, despite the fact the opportunity for him to be involved in all of my childhood was ripped away and we lost each other for a few years. So there we were, on a well-earned break, looking into the garden adorned with green leaves and purple flowers. The lingering smell of sizzling sausages mixed with the sickly sweet stench of cigarette smoke that hung in the air. He looked over at me and said \"I'm proud of you\". I felt myself glowing. I loved my dad and everything I did, I wanted him to see and be a part of. So, after finding each other again, I was making the most of it. He reached over and his arms enveloped me in a massive hug. I took a moment to reflect on how safe I felt in his arms and was a child again for a second, smelling smoke and our hard-earned sweat mixed together. \"I'm so happy to see you come into your own,\" he said as he released me \u2014 a statement I still don't think I quite understand, but I understand enough to know it was a statement of pride. He reinforced that by following with \"you're doing a really good job and this is good food\". As I stood there next to my rock, my life, my dad, watching the fruits of my labour being gratefully devoured by the masses, his voice recurred in my head: \"I'm proud of you\". Indeed, in that moment, he made me feel proud of myself, proud of my accomplishments but most of all, proud that he was proud of me. When I look at my siblings and the people we are and becoming I feel proud to be a part of my dad's legacy \u2014 strong, honest, kind, wise, courageous \u2014 that's how I will always remember him. It didn't make it any easier knowing the brain cancer was going to steal him from us; it still happened too soon. Never is there a 'good' time to say goodbye. When he left, none of us were really ready for it. Indeed, that very morning we were discussing tuning the guitar strings. I do however, feel extremely grateful that we had those last few weeks in the hospital to bask in his resplendent humour and deep wisdom. Like I said at his funeral, \"if we become half the parent that dad was to us, we will be fine\". \u2014 by I am Pip Al Molinaro: Born 1919 \"Yep-yep-yep-yep.\" Fans of American sit-com Happy Days will know Arnold's drive-in was a better place for its loveable cook, 'Big Al' Delvecchio and his [trademark \"yep-yep-yep-yep\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC2BMBdul0o) response. But he didn't just flip burgers and dispense dating advice. Actor Al Molinaro, who died on October 30, also starred as Murray the cop in Garry Marshall's hit comedy, The Odd Couple, which ran from 1970 - 1975. He was born in Wisconsin, USA \u2014 not far from Milwaukee, the setting for Happy Days \u2014 and was one of ten children. Molinaro's father was a well-regarded member of the Italian community and ran restaurants, taverns and hotels. Before taking up acting, he played clarinet in dance bands but eventually moved to California and in 1954, had a role in a small film. It was his last role for 15 years and in the meantime, Molinaro started a debt collection agency and invested in property. While at acting classes, he met Penny Marshall who recommended him to her director brother Garry. Molinaro's big break came with his role as Officer Murray Greshler in 1975. His character proved so popular he was soon cast in Happy Days, where he stayed for ten series. After Happy Days came an unsuccessful TV pilot and a range of guest appearances. He also appeared in several commercials and opened a chain of Big Al's Diners across the American Midwest. Molinaro was apparently working on a memoir at the time of his death. Laurel Pinyon: Born 1925 \"For a lady no taller than a child of 10 years old she certainly has so much spunk in her.\" I was once promised her 50-year-old kitchen table, on the condition of finding a man to marry and having kids to seat at its coral-coloured top. That was straight after I was told I was an old maid, especially if I didn't tie the knot soon. I was 21. She was 87. For a lady no taller than a child of 10 years old, she certainly has so much spunk in her. With her eyesight failing and the distance between us large, we would only see her once a year but it was always so memorable when we would knock on the door. The game of guess who the grandchild was between my two brothers and I was sad, yet funny all the same as she would reach out and up to feel our faces and the amount of hair we each had. She was always spot on. When I stayed with my grandma, we would have to live as she did, dinner at five and no air conditioning until nearly 40 degrees. We would always tell her we needed to go for our walk but instead find something a bit more filling and satisfying than a cup of soup and a piece of toast. Her saying sticks with me and I repeat it in my head or aloud each day, it's the amazing reminder that we can always do better in the world, for ourselves and for others. Better, better, best, Never let it rest, Until the better is better, And the better is best. We can always keep striving to try our hardest, especially on the hardest days we face. Grandma celebrated her 90th birthday in March. She looked amazing and really enjoyed being surrounded by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, family and friends. Albeit, she whispered in my ear that she was \"not liking all these photos being taken\". I'm glad she stuck it out and now we have so many wonderful memories to look back on and remember. It was one last beautiful \"hurrah\" before we were all called back up to the beautiful town she called home on the Murray River for a more solemn occasion. \u2014 by Creative Warrior Myuran Sukumaran: Born 1981 \"When I think back at my life, I never really contributed to anything. Now I'm doing all sorts of stuff... It feels good.\" Like his co-accused Andrew Chan, Myuran Sukumaran was found guilty of drug smuggling by an Indonesian court and sentenced to death by firing squad. But until he discovered drugs, Sukumaran, or 'Myu' as he was known, [had been considered courteous, quiet and reserved](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/obituary-myuran-sukumaran-19812015-20150428-1muvfo.html). He was the eldest child of Sri Lankan parents and born in London, but migrated to Australia with his family in 1985. Sukumaran and Chan actually attended the same high school in the western suburbs of Sydney, although were not friends at school. After working in a mail room and at the passport office, Sukumaran became disillusioned and fell into the drug scene, seduced by the parties and quick money. He and Chan met each other at one of these parties and, as part of the Bali Nine, were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 while trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin out of the country. Sukumaran later described his arrest, on his 24th birthday, as \"a blessing\". After being sentenced to death and jailed, he decided to explore his interest in art and began studying for a Bachelor of Fine Arts by correspondence. He found a friend and mentor in artist Ben Quilty who described Sukumaran and Chan as \"quiet, humble, good natured, humorous young men, young Australian men.\" Sukumaran also mentored other prisoners and sold his paintings. He held a one-man show in Melbourne in 2014. [He was executed on April 29](/news/2015-04-29/andrew-chan-and-myuran-sukumaran-executed/6426654) on the Indonesian prison island of Nusakambangan. He would have completed his degree at the end of 2015. Professor Richard Cotton: Born 1940 \"Around 7 million babies are born each year with serious and often deadly genetic defects ... \" Geneticist Professor Richard Cotton spent his professional life working to improve the detection of genetic mutations which impact on human disease. He was [an innovative researcher and a driving force in preventing and treating genetic disorders and birth defects](https://www.hgsa.org.au/hgsanews/obituary-prof-richard-cotton) and was involved in the establishment in Melbourne of the Human Variome Project in 2006. Cotton's particular area of interest was finding a way to make mutation detection technologies cheaper and simpler. Together with Professor David Danks, Cotton co-founded the Murdoch Institute in 1986. He then went on to found the Mutation Research Institute at St Vincent's in Melbourne. He also founded the scientific journal Human Mutation after finding there was nowhere for researchers and doctors to report their findings. It is now one of the world's top genetics journals. Cotton's theoretical and practical research at Cambridge, UK in Cesar Milstein's laboratory ultimately led to Milstein's 1984 Nobel Prize win. Cotton was born in Victoria and grew up on a citrus and cattle farm at South Wangaratta. He was a boarder at Melbourne Grammar School and went on to study agricultural science at Melbourne University. One of his professors encouraged Cotton to continue his science studies, which he did, eventually receiving his Doctor of Science (DSc) in 1983. From there, Cotton went on to work in some of the world's most impressive human genetics laboratories. [In 2011 he spoke at TedX in Sydney](http://tedxsydney.com/site/item.cfm?item=FC929BF0C290F6C975E7E9173EC99F51) on the Human Variome Project and wrote more than 200 scientific papers and two books. He died on June 14 following a stroke and is survived by his wife Dr Elizabeth Smibert and family. Krystal Page: Born 1987 \"She translated what she saw into words in such a way that I wondered often if she may be a very ancient soul returned to heal.\" Krystal left us in the early months of winter. She was an amazing unique poet and a divine gift to all who knew her. Poetry was Krystal's truth. The words she left behind are the essence of her soul. Every moment that defined her, from the hardships to the first sparks of her true love, Krystal laid them down in poetic verse. She found beauty in everything. Before she died she told me that I could share her work with the world, although she was shy about it and never thought her words were good enough. Krystal was a truly magnificent artist. She saw the world like nobody I've ever known. She translated what she saw into words in such a way that I wondered often if she may be a very ancient soul returned to heal and share knowledge with those lucky enough to know her. If I could see her just once more, I'd fall at her feet and beg she join me for whatever crazy run we'd have. I'd have shown her a life unknown. Dark as it is under that cloud called depression, there is sun and blue sky just beyond its boundaries. But depression runs on a trajectory, a steady decline away from blue skies into the misty fog of suicide. I cannot allow myself think of the phases of pain, and the sleepless nights Krystal would have endured before the end. It rattles me to tears. Such vibrant life, ended voluntarily, for nothing. Reading Krystal's work, I feel she is with me. I am closer to her. Her words, her thoughts, the ups and downs, all of it is all-magnificent poetry. An orchestra of life, with her gentle hands working as conductor. For us who are still here, we receive her final gift with a smile and goosebumps. Miss you lovely.

Friend.\" My dad joined my beautiful mom in eternal life on November 11. He was surrounded by his family and a room filled with LOVE \u2014 love they created over 69 years ago. This man was the greatest man I have ever known. We were not well off, there were seven of us kids spread out over 22 years, but we never knew we were poor. One of my special memories of my dad was as a child during the Christmas season. He would take me shopping to pick out my very own snow-globe; nothing fancy by today's standards, but special to me. I would gaze into it and make up stories of who or what was happening inside my snow-globe. I will always treasure those moments where he made me feel special. Good bye for now dad, give mom a hug..... I love you. \u2014 by Lori5 Barry (Bas) Arter Harding: Born 1943 \"Dad was an such a incredibly kind-hearted man, and would do anything to help anyone, or any animal in need.\" Husband, father, poppy, firefighter, fisherman, animal lover, joker, king of the kids and all round good bloke \u2014 that's my dad. My dad was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer six weeks before he passed away on January 7. I am struggling with this time of year because it still feels so surreal that he is gone, that we will never hear his beautiful soft voice or see his cheeky smile. Dad was an such a incredibly kind-hearted man, and would do anything to help anyone, or any animal in need. I have fond memories of him walking around the farm with orphaned baby geese in his pockets, and walking through the paddocks with a whole herd (of about 50) geese trailing behind him. He was also a dedicated fire fighter for 37 years, and was always the first to volunteer to help in times of emergency. I remember one time there was a fire call and Mum had the car so Dad took off to the fire station on my brother's dragster bike! Mum will kill me for this story but it sums up the type of person Dad was: we were talking about sleeping, and Mum's snoring, and Dad said, \"It doesn't bother me, I just make my breathing match your mother's and pretend it's me snoring.\" In his final weeks, Dad spend a lot of time pondering life, and life for Mum after he passed. I think the most beautiful thing he did was, upon seeing a wedge-tail eagle flying in a nearby paddock, he said to Mum: \"After I'm gone,whenever you see a wedge-tail, it's me watching over you.\" And you know that eagle has not let her down. Many significant times since Dad's passing, the eagle has miraculously appeared flying above: on Anzac Day when Dad would be marching with the fire brigade, three hours away from home at the beach where we scattered his ashes, when she was walking his dog and feeling alone. Thank you Dad, for all that you have given us. Our love for you is eternal. \u2014 by Renelle Greg Strom: Born 1958 \"He was successful in everything he did, including business, family and cars.\" Greg was a man who loved fiercely and without hesitation. He was successful in everything he did, including business, family and cars. He left suddenly, with much yet to do, but now his legacy will be carried on by his wife Carol, kids Jared and Nadia and loyal German Shepherd \u2014 Nurse Ellie. We owe everything to the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse for all their love on our journey. \u2014 by Nadia Capplis Rita Ann Broadway: Born 1948 \"Rita believed everyone had the potential to create, whether it be through drawing, painting.\" My sister Rita was 17 years older than me. Our mum and dad died when I was 14. Rita became a mother to me. She was born in Bermondsey England. Rita had a passion for art. Struggling with bipolar, Rita expressed herself through her art. An art teacher for years, Rita enjoyed letting her students be free to express themselves through art. Rita believed everyone had the potential to create, whether it be through drawing, painting. \"Just start by putting marks on the paper,\" she would tell her students. Rita inspired in me creativity and the ability to see the beauty in even the simplest things, such as the rays of the sun through the trees. I miss her. \u2014 by Caron Uncle John Rogers: Born 1951 \"They shared such an amazing love that is rare and like a fairy tale.\" This photo marked the day of the most incredible love story. My Uncle John met his darling when she was 16. The relationship blossomed and then, like flowers, it came to an end. Both went their separate ways, but they both enjoyed life to its fullest. Travelling the world pursuing their chosen careers, Grace married and had two children. Uncle John had two children but never married. Years slipped away, both kept in touch. Then they found each other again and the romance bloomed into the most amazing love. On December 4, 2010 these two beautiful souls married \u2014 my uncle was 59. They shared such an amazing love that is rare and like a fairy tale. The time that they had together was filled with love, joy and blessings. They had their ups and downs and my uncle was diagnosed with lung cancer. He had surgery and then powered on. It was then that they decided to follows their dreams and made a bucket list of what they wanted to do; what they may have otherwise put off, even though his health was fine. Then this year, Uncle John went in for a physical for work only to find that his cancer was back. It was an aggressive type that consumed his body quickly. The last three months of his life was really hard for us all. He kept his humour, his joy, his love for life and his family, even thought he was incredibly sick from treatment. I some times wonder how moments can just pass. Some you remember for ever and they stay close to your heart. Then there are times when you wait and things just do not happen or do not add up. I know I am blessed with so much in this world, but if I could have changed one moment of time in my life it would have been to stop time to spend some more time with my Uncle John. Time with him was filled with love and joy. He gave me love that was special. Why? Because the love he gave me was unconditional and it was real love. We use this word so flippantly these days. My Uncle John used this word because he meant it. Thank you for loving me My Uncle John. In a world where we can feel so alone you made me feel special. I miss you. \u2014 by Belinda Simmonds Jacqueline Heath: Born 1973 \"Joyful, caring, generous and with a sassy spirit, Jacqueline radiated to all those who loved her.\" On October 21, my darling sister Jacqueline, only 42, was diagnosed with a rare duodenal cancer. Joyful, caring, generous and with a sassy spirit, Jacqueline radiated to all those who loved her. She was a fashionista, shopaholic, and successful career woman. Despite her fighting spirit, she succumbed to this aggressive form of cancer only eight short weeks following the diagnosis. In the end, all she cared about was her loving husband Matthew and her family. We are all terribly sad but as her little nephew Michael knows, she is our heavenly guardian angel, here to look over us forever. We need to continue enjoying life, supporting each other as the close family we are and honouring her memory. I will be having a cocktail for you in Fiji my darling. \u2014 by Paddy Donald Ross Smith: Born 1928 \"While living in Glenroy he helped establish the scout group and procured a meeting hall.\" Donald Ross Smith was the husband of Joan, father of five children, grandfather of nine and great-grandfather of 12. He was a keen and successful golfer, a member at Northern Golf Club when he lived in Glenroy and the Mt Macedon and Goonawarra clubs when he moved to Sunbury. Donald also played table tennis exceptionally well. While living in Glenroy he helped establish the scout group and procured a meeting hall. He was a medical officer for Sunbury soccer club at Langama Park and enjoyed his soccer even more than football after his beloved Bombers disgraced themselves. This will be our first Christmas without our dad and he will be sadly missed. Love Judith \u2014 by Judith Heywood Malcolm John Hooper: Born 1960 \"The 'Mal effect' as we've started calling it, gave us all the chance to get to know each other better.\" Malcolm regarded everyone as family. Throughout his life, he moved between groups of people \u2014 a couple of different jobs, Apex, cycling \u2014 and at his wake, we realised how strong his influence had been on everyone. The 'Mal effect', as we've started calling it, gave us all the chance to get to know each other better. He told nearly everyone he met he didn't want a funeral, just a wake and that was what happened \u2014 a big party where we could all share stories about him and have a laugh. Even if he hadn't seen someone for years, they still spoke or emailed regularly. I miss him. \u2014 by Saradam Austin Fincham: Born 1930 \"A man that inspired everyone around him.\" Austin John Wallace Fincham, what a life you led. A qualified electrician, a water polo champion and a man that inspired everyone around him. With a love of fishing that was almost infectious, it was hard not to get involved whenever he grabbed a rod and went on his adventures. And when my own grandfather (and one of his closest friends) passed away mere months before my birth, it's almost as if he instinctively knew that I'd want him to be my gramps! Austin was the kind of man who was easily pleased and easily pleased people, with a big cheeky grin and his quick wit. It broke all of our hearts as his health slowly declined and finally took its toll. Big Ozzy, you will be greatly missed by everyone whose lives you touched. But especially by me, the granddaughter of your closest friends. Cast a line for me big fella, until we meet again. \u2014 by Rosede Phillip John Barnes: Born 1954 \"Phil was passionate about his family, art, cycling and making a difference.\" I called you 'my beautiful man' and you called me your 'happy pill'. Phil was passionate about his family, art, cycling and making a difference. He was an incredible dad to Rebecca and Brydie and an adored 'Poppy' to Liam, Clementine, Zafari and Zanzibar. I knew him for all of six years. His wit, his humour and thirst for knowledge \u2014 he devoured art, philosophy, science and cooking books \u2014 was infectious, as was his ability to tell tall tales that you really believed. He had embarked on a project for The Dock - Kingston Foreshore whereby his portraits of well known athletes would be hung on the wall and the sale or auction of these artworks would benefit a charity nominated by the athlete. This is still a work in progress. In one of his last Facebook posts, he wrote that he was in despair after seeing a Rembrandt self-portrait done at the age of 22. How could he possibly imagine that talent at that age? The portrait brought him to tears. The next day though, he was fired up and thinking of new ideas for his artworks. \"This is what art is about \u2014 bringing joy to man's existence,\" Phil said in Amsterdam in 2015. My beautiful man passed away in Antwerp on August 25, a week into our seven-week holiday. I love and miss him every day. \u2014 by Lindyelly Donald Oliver Sharrock: Born 1931 \"Dad taught me to say what I mean and mean what I say.\" Dad had a hard upbringing and as a result, I think he invented 'tough love' long before psychologists did. And I am grateful to him for that. There are many things \u2014 including his death \u2014 that I might not have survived intact if it weren't for Dad's lessons in independence, decisiveness and courage. Dad taught me to say what I mean and mean what I say. He didn't make false promises, flatter or lie. As a teenager, the occasional white lie wouldn't have hurt (after all, who wants to hear they are gangly and awkward?), but as a result I never fall for flattery! Through Dad, I discovered reading and the magic of words. He was a pedant for correct grammar, meaning and spelling. In primary school in the 1970s, thinking it was cool, I used the word 'daggy' once at home, only to be pulled up smartly by Dad, handed a dictionary and told never to use a word unless I knew its meaning. My father's greatest gift to me, the strongest anchor, is a love of the coast. Dad was a man of the inland, a man born in the bush who never learnt to swim and yet, by accident rather than design, he raised three children who share a love of the sea and all it provides. It is our playground and our haven; the place we go to heal, to celebrate, to love and to mourn. The place you call home isn't always the place you grow up. Sometimes it is the place that captures your heart before you know you have one. The coast is where my heart is; with Dad, my anchor. \u2014 by Genelle Naomi Forsyth: Born 1958 \"Wacky and wonderful wisdom, with a side of cheek, was her specialty.\" Naomi was the costume designer, the expert gift wrapper, the artistic director and operations manager. She was the nurse and the doctor, the late-night counsellor and the life coach over copious cups of tea. She was superstitious and stylish, an 80s glamazon and dancing queen. Wacky and wonderful wisdom, with a side of cheek, was her specialty up until the day she left this world. I held her hand every day and night while my Dad would sit at the foot of her bed. We'd cling on to every word she could possibly muster. She was lying in her bed in the palliative care facility, the morphine swimming through her body in an attempt to quell her pain while the radio played quietly in the background. She was drifting in and out of consciousness, opening her eyes every couple of hours to say something briefly, whether it be lucid or hallucinatory, before drifting back off to the land of medically-induced nod. On her second last day on earth, she awoke suddenly, raised her right arm in the air and pointed forward, wagging her index finger as if she were about to tell off a small child for being naughty and breaking the rules. \"Listen to me, are you listening?\" she said, in her motherly tone I will miss every single day. We reassured her that we were there by her side and that she had our full, undivided attention. She paused, and although her eyes were closed, her right arm and right index finger were still wagging ever so convincingly as we waited for her forthcoming words of wisdom. She drew in breath, held her head high and said, pointing her finger to match each syllable she articulated, \"If it's not Crim-Safe, then it's not crim-safe.\" They were the last words of wonderfully wacky wisdom that she left us. Hilarious, heartbreaking, and Naomi to a tee. It was one of the only times we chuckled in that room, a memory which will stay with us forever, and proof that radio advertising really does work. \u2014 by Latoyah Robin (Gibbo) Gibson: Born 1954 \"He cared deeply for family, friends, animals, plants, timber, spirituality and truth.\" Rob died very suddenly on the February 1, of a heart attack. Just 60, he was amazingly fit and healthy and had just achieved three of his dreams. In 2014 he had achieved his black belt in Tae Kwon Do, built and raced his second historic motor cycle, and commenced work on rebuilding an old wooden boat. He was the soulmate and husband of Tracel; 36 years of adventuring together and chasing dreams \u2014 most of which he achieved. A proud father to his two daughters, Mel and Erryn, who always knew that the world would be alright when Dad arrived. The joys of his life were his two grandsons, Cal and Blayne. Every time a photo was taken he would be standing there with a hand on their shoulder or showing them how to do something. Rob had no time for money, didn't care much for flash houses and had no time for politics and pretence. But he did care deeply, for family, friends, animals, plants, timber, spirituality and truth. His favourite writer was Terry Pratchett; same sense of irreverence for rules and convention; same wacky sense of humour. Irreverent is a good word for Rob. Politically incorrect, a grumpy old man when he fumed about war, politics, pollution and the stupidity in the world, a stirrer and a lover of small and simple pleasures. But above all he made the world feel safe. Everyone \u2014 family, friends and those who shared interests like martial arts, bikes and boats \u2014 everyone knew that if Rob was there, it would be alright because he could make or fix anything. Missed more than words can say, but he achieved nearly all of his dreams, had loving parents, brothers and sisters, was happily married, got to see his kids grow up and enjoyed his grandchildren, had wonderful friends, a small home in a great community, travelled all over the world and had sheds full with every tool imaginable, and some he invented. His only regret would be that he couldn't have more of the same or at least, a full-blown Viking funeral. Now gone on to the next big adventure with his dad Fred, brother Jeremy and loved family and friends who went ahead. We will meet again one day. Until then, from Gibbo, \"live long and prosper.\" \u2014 by Tracel William Roy Aitken: Born 1922 \"Dad and mum were married for 68 years; it is hard to talk about one without the other.\" Dad left school at 15, became an apprentice boilermaker, then a national manager and started his own small business in retirement. He and mum were married for 68 years; it is hard to talk about one without the other. Mum and Dad knew both hard times and good times. In their retirement, there were also many holidays abroad where they made friends, staying in close touch with them as well as with friends from their early days, from workplaces and their later years. They valued people. Mum died late in 2014 and Dad in September 2015. He missed mum so much; they'd known each other from the ages of 16 and 21. As he declined physically in a final illness, dad's creative capacities came to the fore and it was amazing to see the world through his eyes. That was his gift to me from those last months \u2014 to see how it was possible to keep learning and growing and loving life, no matter how hard it was to live it, right up to the end. They both wanted to live their lives over again. At 89 and 93, they didn't want to go. We miss them of course. Their retirement village neighbours also miss them \u2014 mum was beautiful, they say to me, and dad knew everything about the village and how it all worked; they relied on him to explain the latest changes. Dad joins mum as they rest in peace, together always, their lives well lived. \u2014 by Lynette Daniele Lattarulo: Born 1996 \"To her friends, Dani was an irreplaceable light in our lives.\" Those who were fortunate enough to know Dani well knew that behind her loud voice and strong opinions lay an incredible young woman who wrote, sang and laughed with all her heart. She was a much beloved daughter, older sister, partner, cousin, niece, and an adored friend to many. To her friends, Dani was an irreplaceable light in our lives. One of my favourite memories was us singing our favourite music in the car on the way home from 'anime club' (JubyPhonic, we love you!). I used to smile as she told us about the latest chapter of her favourite manga or reminisce about her fond memories riding horses. Her writing was as unique as she was and the stories she wrote still bring smiles to peoples' faces to this day. Dani's willingness to trust others and to be herself may have gotten her into a bit of trouble here and there, but to me it gave me so much courage to care less about what others think of us and just live. She fit as many of the fun and memories into her short 19 years as she could. It came to us all as a shock when she went into hospital. Fortunately, she didn't have to bear the knowledge of how ill she was as she was in a coma all through her 52-day fight with leukaemia. We all miss you so much, Dani. You gave us all so much, more than I could ever repay. To quote JubyPhonic's 'eight hundred' (I've seen how many times you've listened to that one!): \"... in such a pretty world we both had loved, just know I'm living on for both you and me.\" Miss you always, bro. \u2014 by ZoeKay Thomas Peter Tyrer: Born 1936 \"The only time he cried was when his beloved Blackburn Rovers soccer team won the League in 1995.\" Dad was so full of laughter. Mum said the only time he cried was when his beloved Blackburn Rovers soccer team won the League in 1995. But Dad didn't only love soccer; he loved to travel and was open to experiencing the big, wide, world that lay outside his home in the north of England. He loved the beaches of Australia and on a visit to Rottnest Island, the sea warm and turquoise, he went for a swim. He wanted Mum to come into the water and swim with him as well, but it always took a lot for Mum to venture into the sea \u2014 it was either too cold, too rough, too many fish in it, or she'd just washed her hair. Today's excuse was that there was too much seaweed around, so Dad started removing the seaweed from the water's edge and dragging it up the beach so it was beyond the reach of the incoming tide. After ten minutes or so of cleaning the beach, he'd cleared some space around the water's edge so Mum had to go in now! There they both were, laughing and swimming together on a beautiful summer's day on Rottnest Island, still laughing nearly 40 years after the day they were married. And from my vantage point sitting on the beach, all was well with the world. As well as adoring our Mum, Dad loved playing golf, Monty Python (his favourite sketch was the Philosophers' Football Game \u2014 no surprises there), dogs, jazz, art, sailing boats, the beach and the warm sun in the late afternoon when its harshness was diminishing and the light softened. \"It's good weather for tanning,\" he used to say. The sun shone out of his smile, the joy of life was in his eyes and radiated from his sweet and gentle heart. As long as you'd done your best, Dad would say, \"then I'm proud of you\". I'm very grateful to have been so fortunate to have had such a lovely man for my Dad. Between him and Mum, they gave me the best childhood a girl could wish for. I miss him every day, and will for the rest of my life. \u2014 by Elaine Patricia Helena Johnson: Born 1927 \"Once met, never forgotten. Mum had more energy than all of us put together.\" How can you put your mother's life into words for others to understand? You can't do it. You can try but it doesn't come out right. The only thing you should know is that you only have one mother and one father and even if you don't see eye to eye at times, I guarantee you will feel empty when they are gone. Mum had more energy than all of us put together so it is going to be particularly quiet now. Going shopping with her (even in her sixties) wore us out. She was your typical English stay-at-home mum from her era who cooked from scratch, sewed our clothes and starched the sheets, but she had one heck of a cheeky streak and a huge sense of humour. She married dad, moved to Cornwall in 1962 and never looked back, leaving the 'big smoke' behind. They had spent their honeymoon in Cornwall and never forgot the place. We loved the countryside and kept dogs and horses, although mum never plucked up the courage to ride, saying she would rather go for a walk. And walk she did; five miles a day. She would swim a mile a week as well. This photo was taken at Coverack when we visited her with her first grandchild. My dad passed away from cancer at the age of 57 and we were all devastated. However, Mum picked herself up and busied herself with charitable work and the church community. Mum was very proud that dad's father, Victor Louis, was an Olympic gold medallist, and she loved to relate all those family stories \u2014 over and over! In her later years, she would come to visit us in Australia. She soon found some dancing venues and made many friends here. During her last visit four years ago, it was sad that she was not fit enough to get out and about, and then the following year her health went into decline. She passed away at Poldhu to the sound of the waves crashing and the seagulls crying. Bless you Mum. \u2014 by Rachel Allen Geoff Grahl: Born 1967 \"An amazing dad who was so exited to take his kids to Vietnam. Unbeknownst to us, it would be our last family holiday.\" This photo was taken on the steps of the Saigon Opera house. We had just arrived in Ho Chi Minh City with two other families on the start of a 10-day holiday around Vietnam. Geoff was always so full of life and what made him a brilliant dad was that he never lost that innate playfulness. Here we are waiting on the steps to meet our guide for our street food tour. The big smiles on those faces were the result of Geoff saying something either funny or embarrassing. It was hot, humid and unfamiliar; the first real trip our kids had taken out of Australia. That night we walked all over Ho Chi Minh trying banh mi, balut (duck embryos), beautiful fried ricecake noodles and fantastic Vietnamese coffee. Geoff got to know people; he was always curious. He asked the guide as many questions about her family and life as he did about the food. He encouraged the kids to try everything, even making it a competition. His trademark laugh was heard throughout the evening as we moved from one market to the next. He tried to live as best he could in the moment. The first lesson of the tour was \"how to cross the road\". If you have ever crossed the road in Vietnam you will know what a culture shock it is the first time. Geoff just put his hand out and said, \"Let's go\" and off we went, scooters meandering around us. From there we travelled onto Hoi An and Hanoi as well as doing a beautiful cruise on Halong Bay, with many moments like this one. Six months after this photo was taken, Geoff died unexpectedly in hospital while undergoing treatment for an incredibly rare autoimmune disorder. And while we miss that larger-than-life character every day, I am grateful that he lived a curious and playful life. \u2014 by Rach_Grlz James Cameron Davidson: Born 1932 \"He did more than I could ever hope to do but told me he was proud of what I did do.\" Dad had a pretty remarkable life. As an adult I was always finding out about some new job he had done, or crazy situation he had been involved with. Be that bluffing to fend off belligerents with an empty rifle while in the RAF, walking miles through the hills with a broken ankle while a forester, being an author, helping the long term unemployed back into work, being a missionary with mum in Hong Kong, or an actually-popular politician in our native Scotland. I never can live up to the amazing stuff he did but even so, he always made me feel he was proud of what I did do and that was enough, coming from him. This picture was taken a few years ago when he took me to the places where his family came from \u2014 a small village in north-east Scotland called Inverallochy. Mum stayed in the car but we walked and talked for far too long including on the grass, a drying green now which had formerly been where his mother had grown up. He told me \u2014 and I had the foresight to video \u2014 stories of her time there. It's one of my precious little memories. After our wandering, we went to a small cafe in the village for a bowl of his favourite tomato soup and a cuppa. He did love his coffee, whenever and wherever! One of the few similarities with us is that I inherited his taste for both of those food stuffs; not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing! Regarding that jaunt though, I really genuinely loved our little visit and the time we had together there. Earlier this year he became suddenly \u2014 and as it turned out, deathly \u2014 ill but his final gift to his children was that he held on until my sister was able to fly back from Cyprus and I was able to get over to Scotland to see him. I picked up a car and drove straight from the airport to the hospital and when I held his hand and spoke to him, he looked up at me and gripped my hand and knew I was there. I got to tell him I loved him and he was an awesome Dad. It wasn't too very long after that and he was gone. I really painfully miss him. \u2014 by Andrew Davidson Helen Elford: Born 1932 \"Helen was married to Tom for almost 60 years. They died within a week of each other.\" Helen Elford was a person whose life was love, faith, loyalty and gratitude. She was a person who saw the best in people and lived a simple life, relatively uncomplicated by the modern world. Helen grew up with parents who made do and as parents try to do, wanted the best for her. Clothing was made by hand by her mother; if it was a special occasion it was bought. Food was what you grew, and the weekly shopping trip to Benalla. Friends and family were this family's life. Doing the right thing by your neighbours was not just a church teaching, it was practiced every day. Her parents were honest, hardworking people. They taught her well. Helen and Tom ran their farm as a business. Mum paid all the accounts on time or early \u2014 everyone had to be paid. Everyone was trying to make ends meet and she had an integrity that was unwaning, right up to the end. While dad did much of the hard graft, mum backed up with driving trucks and utes, mustering, marking and shed handing; whatever needed to be done. All that, plus looking after three children and cooking and cleaning for a large farmhouse, gardening, looking after orphaned animals, dogs, cats and chickens, sewing and knitting. Dad would have breakfast ready for mum who would get up at about 7 or 7.30; that was normal to us. Thinking about it now, how tired she must have been, but rarely showed it. Helen loved beautiful things. She loved handcrafts of all kinds \u2014 weavings, ceramics, patchwork, embroidery. She appreciated the work and the beauty. She had a love-hate relationship with the solitude she found on the farm. There was time to reflect and enjoy the company of animals and the land. She loved to garden; it was a great thinking time. But there were times where she desperately missed having friends and neighbours close by. Most of all, Helen loved her family. She missed her Mum and Dad always. She loved her sister all her life. Mum loved having her children, grandchildren and step-grandchildren close by, loved getting phone calls, loved big family dinners and lunches. Her sadness at not seeing us enough was never put on us. She would wait in hope that she would see us soon. She would ask how each child was going. She loved hearing what they were up to and shared the joy of every achievement and worried about their welfare when things didn't go their way. All the kids were part of her family. She loved them all very much. Dad would always buy Mum a birthday present and a Christmas present. I was often taken shopping because Dad had seen a piece of jewellery that he liked and would ask my opinion. Some of those pieces were a bit questionable, but she loved them all the same. He loved her and would come to visit her in their last years, to check that she was okay. I would say to Dad, \"I am just going round to see Mum\" and he would say, \"yes, you do that...\" We now know that Helen's love for Tom was her love story \u2014 true and deep. She couldn't live without him. We love her so very much and will miss her so very much. Always. \u2014 by Elpy42 Margaret Mackaway: Born 1961 \"An amazing, hard-working woman.\" Margie always wanted to look her best even when she was very ill. We forget what her real hair colour was because she was always at the hairdressers! Being a nurse, she worked damn hard all her life. She used to do the most amazing formal cakes and many people would have had their wedding cake made by her. She will be missed. \u2014 by Abarthdriver Margaret Delmont: Born 1916 \"My mother's 99th birthday.\" Mum was a remarkable woman who was celebrating 99 years of living in this photo. She left her home in England in 1951 for a new life in New Zealand. After many happy years there, my mum and dad came to Sydney in 1986 and enjoyed many happy years in Sydney. Mum had a wonderful sense of humour and great resilience. She was always reaching out to help others and was an amazing example to her children. A bad fall at the end of August resulted in a broken femur and saw her end up in a nursing home. She celebrated her 99th birthday on Sept 24 and on Oct 9 she died peacefully. A truly remarkable woman who has left an extraordinary legacy. \u2014 by Mary-Anne Kevin Francis Byrnes: Born 1925 \"A lover of life and a teacher.\" Kevin was born in Sydney in 1925. He was a lot of things in his lifetime which came to an end nine days shy of his 90th birthday on January 29 on the Sunshine Coast. He was a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, electrician, jeweller, pilot, golfer, aero club & golf club president, golf course designer and much more. His last day of work as a jeweller was December 6, 2014 \u2014 before he succumbed to his illness. As a golfer, he experienced six holes-in-one in his life and shot a score under his age five times during his 80s. Kevin was wise and philosophical to the end. He was an imparter of knowledge and an icon to his eight children, 17 grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and to most people who crossed his path. We miss him. \u2014 by Therese Gittoes Tom Elford: Born 1931 \"Tom Elford loved Australia and all things Australian. Married to Helen for almost 60 years they died within a week of each other.\" Tom Elford was a man of spirit and determination, a man born at a time when Australia was still a nation being built on the sheep's back and he wanted to be a part of that. He was just a small child when the second of the world wars changed the lives of all Australians and that meant that his childhood was not simple or normal in many ways. As a young boy, the knowledge that men, young men, could go to fight to give others freedom, galvanized his love of the Australian way of life. Freedom and the wide open spaces were his life. Tom became a businessman whose business was farming. His passion was farming and his great love was sown and grown in and of the earth. He watched and learned, he tried and tested \u2014 and accomplished and succeeded more often than not. He built up stock almost uncannily for good seasons and reduced stock again, seemingly by instinct. Hay and water were seemingly plentiful and Tom made sure of that. He spent time talking to people about the business of farming; parked on the side of the road, walking down the street, at the sale yards or at the tip. Farming was his life and a lifelong interest. Tom built so much more than just a farming business. He spent his life innovating and inventing. He was a welder, a mechanic, a carpenter, a plumber, a fisherman, a concreter, a gardener, a house painter, a cook and seemingly able to make anything out of nothing. Gates and fences, a yacht, tank stands, cattle and sheep yards, a sheep dip, restoring old bikes for his children, chicken hutches ... all built by hand. He tried tanning hides himself to varying degrees of success, even sun-drying fruit in the backyard \u2014 which was most unsuccessful, with nature enjoying more of the fruit than humans. When farming was tough, he went to work building fences and planting trees; hard, manual labour. But whether he was working by himself or with mates, the days just went and the evenings were spent in a bath and falling asleep in a chair with a dog or a cat on top of him. Mateship among friends and neighbours was a given. Working in groups, these men worked hard in each other's sheds and yards, tractors and harvesters, mustering, marking and loading. That's just what it was to be a farmer. Daily drives around the stock was an early morning task. Pride was taken with the birth of an animal or sprouting of a crop and the death of an animal was always a blow, but that's what farming served up. Orphaned animals were adopted with vanilla noses or taken home for care. No vet visits \u2014 it either lived or died; nature would take its course. According to Tom, farmers should have Sundays off work. Well, what that meant was still getting up at the same time and making breakfast, checking the stock in the morning then work sharpening the chainsaw or making a gate, repairing a sprinkler or fixing the foot valve at the creek. Lunch was listening to ABC radio and Landline at the same time and falling asleep reading the paper in the sun on the verandah. Really, it was a few hours off. You may ask why a man who had hay fever so badly his eyes would stream and his face would swell, would want to be a farmer? Why would a man whose hands were torn to bleeding from dermatitis would choose such a hands on profession? Well, he loved the life, outdoors, animals, the challenge of business and the innate, built-in desire to provide a good life for his family. He loved the mateship of Apex and Rotary and very much felt good about giving back to his community. He was a shire councillor for some years, president of his children's PTA and regularly had the CFA fire truck on its rotation around the community. He was a city boy who spent his life in the country. We love him. We will miss him always. \u2014 by Elpy42 Betty Churcher: Born 1931 \"Whatever you do my darling, just remember to paint with joy.\" Former National Gallery of Australia (NGA) director Betty Churcher, [fondly referred to by some as \"Betty Blockbuster\", died on March 31.](/news/2015-03-31/former-national-gallery-australia-director-betty-churcher-dies/6318888) She was one of the most adored figures in the Australian art community and a formidable and talented arts administrator. Churcher became first, and so far only, female director of the NGA in 1990 and stayed there until her retirement in 1997. Among her achievements there was to make art more accessible, which she did by bringing important masterpieces to Australia's shores. \"Betty was a pioneer,\" current NGA director Gerard Vaughan said. \"[She] achieved many things, including great acquisitions for the collection, but she also brought extraordinary exhibitions to Australia thanks to her formidable charm and tenacity.\" Her charm extended to sweet talking former prime minister Gough Whitlam into wearing a toga to an exhibition launch. Churcher was born in Brisbane and was first exposed to art after her father took her to the Queensland Art Gallery as a child. \"It was like stepping on a magic carpet because off I went,\" she said of the experience. She began studying and teaching art, both in Australia and London, where she met and married fellow artist Roy Churcher. One of her four sons, Peter Churcher, is also an artist and recalled his mother telling him: \"Whatever you do my darling, just remember to paint with joy.\" Churcher loved art: making it, talking about it, writing about it and sharing her knowledge of it. She presented a television series about art on the ABC called Betty Churcher's Take 5 and also wrote several books about the subject. A melanoma in one eye and macular degeneration in the other slowly robbed her of the ability to see the artworks she had loved and dedicated her life to. She returned to drawing and toured the great galleries of Europe, sketching after hours in an attempt to capture her memories of those artworks on paper. Her legacy is generations of Australians now far more enthusiastic and sophisticated about art. Hec McMillian: Born 1919 \"We had mangoes for breakfasts and apple pies for desert.\" My grandfather was a gentle man. He had a larger than life personality and always had the worst jokes up his sleeve. His laugh was a deep distinctive rumble that resonated from his merry soul and touched your heart. He was kind, loving, and as a little kid, I'd sit on his knee and inhale the scent of scotch as he told me tales of his childhood, or my mother's, the war or how he wooed my grandmother. We had mangoes for breakfasts and apple pies for desert. It wasn't strange in the least to hear lines for shows or movies rehearsed all times of the day or night; it's what I grew up with and I loved it. My grandfather shared with me a love of music and the arts. We attended shows and listened to many pieces of music together. I cherish these memories. He was also known for his charity work with Legacy and the Company of Friends in Canberra that performed for nursing homes and retirement villages. Hec was appointed an MBE and was Senior of the Year in 2004 (ACT). Rain or shine he walked the Anzac Day marches, helping others if they needed an arm, until he was too frail to do so himself. Theatre, film, and TV credits are many including Babe, GP, A Country Practice, Bedroom Farce, Rafferty's Rules and a heap more. Growing up seeing your granddad on the TV was so much fun! This is our first Christmas without him. My grandmother passed a few years back, and they are sadly missed. I will always remember the laughter, overindulgence of food, obsession with Yahtzee, going mushrooming, kisses on my head, afternoon naps and the big hugs. Especially the big hugs. \u2014 by Enkelin Dr Donald Lang: Born 1922 \"A life of service to community, family and country.\" My grandfather was always busy. Throughout his life he was always doing many things at once. Alongside his career as a general practitioner in Cessnock, NSW he was involved in almost every local committee and spent every waking moment either working or volunteering with St Vincent de Paul. His life was a colourful story of adventures in exotic locations and encounters with fascinating characters. I knew him as the learned grandfather who devoured books in his living room, listened to ABC Classic FM 24 hours a day and enjoyed tending to his vast bamboo garden. He knew everybody, and had an anecdote for every occasion. A few winters ago, I took a voice recorder to his house and stayed there for a week, recording his life story as he told it to me over breakfast or during afternoon tea. I will always remember fondly the opportunity I had to just listen, as he relived his full and interesting life. As he told his stories, the young naval officer became a talented doctor working overseas, a husband, a valued and respected community member, a father to six children and grandfather to six more. After that, every time I saw my grandfather, he'd say: \"I've got another story for you!\" And I don't doubt that he had many more. Our last conversation was over the phone, when he wished me well before an overseas trip. He passed away before I got home. I feel so grateful for all our conversations in front of the fire, and will always remember his distinguished intelligence, generosity and unique sense of humour. \u2014 by Lucie Robson Carole Prestney: Born 1943 \"When we look at photos of mum as a young woman, she seems well named as she really did look like a star from the silver screen.\" Mum's family, friends and faith were the most important things in her life. In all her roles as wife, mum, nanny, friend and associate of the Good Samaritan Sisters, mum spread her love, drew her strength and left her legacy. Mum used to tell us that the nuns at school would single her out for not having a saint's name. Ever the romantic, Nan named her after a film star \u2014 Carole Lombard. When we look at photos of mum as a young woman, she seems well named as she really did look like a star from the silver screen. At the tender age of around 15, mum met a handsome young country boy who first spied her in a typing pool at work. All dad knew about her was that she travelled on the number 86 tram line, so he found himself a place to board in Northcote in the hope that he might see her again. Their young friendship slowly blossomed into romance. Mum and dad devoted their lives to each other, and shared a wonderful partnership over nearly 52 years of marriage. It's been so hard to say goodbye. We wish that we had more time, but can take comfort in the knowledge that mum has left the legacy of her love and perseverance. We hope and pray that our generation can continue the passion and love of family that mum and dad have shared with us. Mum will live in our memories and our hearts forever and we will always be extremely proud to call ourselves her children. Merry Christmas mum, we love you. Jane, Catherine, Andrew and Susie xx Forever in my heart, your darling Ray xx With love from all the kids, Sean, Emma, Katie, Josh, Alex, Juliet, Ted, Eloise and Heidi xx \u2014 by Susie Prestney Alan Escombe-Wolhuter: Born 1945 \"Rock and roll bedtime story.\" Born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1945, Alan Escombe-Wolhuter fell in love with the sound of rock and roll in his teens and hopped a ship to England to become a musician. I remember this photo of him \u2014 taken at Island Studios in London in 1971 \u2014 hung in the kitchen of the house I grew up in. I would stare at it while I ate my Weetbix in the morning and try to reconcile this scary-looking rocker with the Dad I knew, who would come home from work late every night and read to me in his deep, gentle voice before bed, his head propped up on my teddy bears. Despite several number one hits with his group The Shake Spears, a legal dispute with the record company in the early 1970s left him virtually penniless. In the years leading up to my birth in 1978 he was scraping together the money to pay off his debts by selling dusters door to door and driving a furniture removal truck. Eventually dad became director of global freight forwarding company Rock-It Cargo. Considered one of the pioneers in the making of the modern music touring world, the list of artists whose world tours he helped manage included Paul McCartney, U2, Queen, The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen, Prince and Michael Jackson, to name but a few. I saw them all in concert when I was just a boy. What an education he gave me! Dad was granted a special achievement visa which allowed him to move from London to Byron Bay in 2005. Over the last few months of his life, even as he struggled with liver and kidney failure, he lay on the couch in his house in the hills near Mullumbimby with a Dictaphone in his hand and narrated his life story. I look forward to telling it. \u2014 by Luke Escombe Samuel Edward Matheson: Born 1990 \"A beautiful young man, son and brother who lived such an amazing full life and achieved so much.\" Our son Sam, born in June 1990, was so loved and he inspired all those that knew him. He was a dynamic, intelligent, loving, hardworking young man full of dreams. He lived such a full life and his humour and enthusiasm touched the lives of so many. He loved the work of Michael Leunig and we dedicated one of his poems to him. 'Anyone can get a life, anyone can lose it, but who will dare to inhabit the thing and use it?' - Leunig. \u2014 by Rachel Rymill Jules Frederick de Brenni: Born 1922 \"Always young at heart ... a dreamer but one who made his dreams reality.\" Although I came somewhat late into Jules's life, I was still privileged to share just over 30 wonderful, love-filled years with him. This photo captured during our last overseas trip epitomises Jules \u2014 stepping out with a smile to meet and make new friends and discover a new world. At 90 years and with heart failure, he was unable to get travel insurance but we decided to continue to live life to its fullest as long as was possible. So, it was off to Italy. This trip was an opportunity to taste the food, wine and culture of various parts of Italy from Udine in the north west to Lecce in the southern heel. In Lecce we found and photographed da Brenna street, as well as other historical information relating to a cathedral given to the city by a relative hundreds of years ago. In the hilltop village of Noepoli, Jules met with the old men of the village each morning on the steps of the church then accompanied them to the wine cave to share home-made wine and stories which went beyond language. Jules had a gift for languages and a great capacity to \"listen with his heart\". These gifts served him well as a pharmacist in Broken Hill and his community work, especially as president of the Good Neighbour Council. He welcomed people from many nations to Broken Hill and helped them settle in a new community in a new land. Many became lifelong friends. Jules leaves me with beautiful memories of a life well lived by a generous, loving man. What a wonderful travelling companion \u2014 now so difficult to continue the journey alone. The doctor who pronounced death said that Jules was the coolest 93-year-old he had ever known! \u2014 by Christine de Brenni Joe Healion: Born 1996 \"A unicorn amongst horses.\" Joe was a wonderful, sweet baby with a smile that would melt your heart. I loved his smile, his passion, his hugs and how when he wanted something he would be the most perfect child a mum could want. He was a vibrant, intelligent boy who taught himself to read at age four. I remember he loved his Harry Potter books so much he wore the toy Harry Potter glasses to school. His teacher actually thought he needed glasses to read. His enthusiasm is one of the greatest things about Joe. He began his love for music at the age of six. It was the beginning of a lifelong passion. He was an amazing musician with great hopes of getting a band together (sadly a heavy metal one) and ruling the rock world! Joe loved Fraser Island and my greatest joy was seeing him playing guitar there and everyone rocking it out to the song he was playing. Joe was always a funny bloke and had a really unique sense of humour, with possibly the best voice impersonations. As Joe grew from boy to teenager I could see the man he would become. Strong, steadfast and with a really good heart. He loved being a man and doing man stuff like having a beer with Dad and going camping and four-wheel driving with his mates. He was looking forward to a life filled with fun, laughter and travel. I'm so grateful the last time I saw him we had the best hug and I said how much I loved him. I miss him beyond words. He died the day he bought that motorbike. He is and forever will be my Joey boy. Goodbye my son. Love you. \u2014 by Carolin Gladys Metcalfe: Born 1920 \"My first feminist role model \u2014 a courageous woman who loved all.\" Gladys Metcalfe (nee Midgley) was my paternal grandmother and my first feminist role model thanks to her spirited and fierce perspective on life. She was born on February 16, 1920 and worked for Buzzacotts and in the army pay office before she met my grandfather. The first time she saw him, she was having driving lessons with his uncle. They pulled up outside the house where my grandfather was in his army uniform and in Nana's words, she thought he was \"a bit of alright\". Gladys and Arthur married at St Alberts in Brisbane on April 3, 1943 and not long after, she gave birth to her first son, Garth Baron in 1944. Garth died in 1987 at the age of 43. In 1947, she gave birth to a baby girl who died shortly after a long and arduous birth. This traumatic event affected Arthur and Gladdy greatly and shaped the rest of their lives. Their sorrow was palpable and raw. My grandmother never got to hold her baby girl, and she was buried in an unmarked grave in Toowong Cemetery. In 1949, my father Ross Brodie entered the world and in 1954, David John Cornell was born. Gladys grew up with Bunny (Elsie), Doffy (Dorothy), Nell and her brother Jack. Her childhood was one of great joy and love, as were her relationships with all of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Gladys was a courageous member of the sisterhood and taught me to recognise my own worth from a young age. She died peacefully at the age of 95 with Dad and myself holding her as her favourite music played. \u2014 by CJ Metcalfe Helen Bruinier (nee Cohn): Born 1931 \"She had a large intellect and a large array of interests which she pursued with tenacity and determination.\" Helen Bruinier, nee Cohn, would introduce herself as a dairy farmer and teacher. She was also an exhibited artist, a published writer, and a self-funded retiree. Helen was a philanthropist, an historian, a poet, a politician, a conservationist, and a consummate collector. She was involved in many community activities and clubs including the Soroptomist Club, the Fellowship of Australian Writers, the Bendigo Art Gallery, the Friends of the Bendigo Cemeteries and the Jewish Historical Society during her long and active life. Her passion for family history resulted in a family biography of her aunt, the sculptor, Ola Cohn ARCA, MBE and the fight to save Ola Cohn's home and artistic legacy in East Melbourne in the early 2000s. She sponsored the La Trobe University Pharmacy Medal in remembrance of another aunt, Lorna Mackay (nee Cohn), the first female pharmacist at the Bendigo Hospital. When she was ten years old she changed her name from Coralie to Helen. Her primary school years were spent at Miss Clarice Brown's Dame School, Donnington in Swan Hill, riding her white horse to school each day. She later attended Melbourne Girls' Grammar School, then graduated from the Bendigo Teachers College in 1951. She overcame several serious illnesses over her lifetime. She was tenacious and determined in everything she tackled. Helen loved horses and was a successful competitor in agricultural shows all over Victoria, including the Melbourne Show. While attending Bendigo Teachers' College, she undertook a solitary epic ride from Bendigo to Swan Hill to holiday with her parents \u2014 it took her three days. Helen married John Bruinier in 1955. She became a dairy farmer and raised three boys whilst also teaching at the Shepparton Technical School. They then moved to Bendigo in the 1970s with Helen teaching at Kangaroo Flat Technical School, pursuing post-graduate studies and entering into local politics. During her retirement, Helen and John travelled extensively within Australia and overseas. She passed away peacefully in August after a long illness. \u2014 by Shelley Cohn Allan Harrison: Born 1923 \"The story of a proud and humble man who touched the lives of all who met him.\" Allan Harrison was a proud man and fiercely loyal to his family and friends. This photograph of him standing in the English Cemetery in Corfu town, paying his respects to his fallen comrades and the loved ones he has lost, evokes memories of a brave and selfless life lived for others. His journey spanned just short of 93 years, beginning in an industrial town in the north of England and culminating in local celebrity status in his adopted home on the Greek island of Corfu. Finding himself alone after the passing of the love of his life, Allan made the brave decision to begin a new life in Greece. So, at the age of 82, he said goodbye to his lifelong home, and with his beloved dog Sam found a second lease of life. He quickly established himself at the local bar in the village of Prinilas where he would drink his daily coffee and brandy, whiling away his days chatting to both locals and holidaymakers, regaling them with tales from his life. My favourite tales were the ones of his darling wife, my grandma Dot (Dorothy). One particular memory this photo reminds me of is the trip he took her on to France. Dorothy had been a war widow when Allan married her and she longed to visit the final resting place of her first husband who was killed in action at the D-Day landings in Normandy. Allan took such pride in organising the trip and made her 40-year-old wish come true. Throughout his life, Allan engaged people with his openness and acceptance of others but it was the sparkle in his eye and the love in his heart when speaking of his family that truly drew people in. I am honoured to have been his only granddaughter. \u2014 by Lyndsey Jeminson Audrey Furber (nee Taylor): Born 1931 \"A 'feminist' before the word was in common use.\" This is a photo of our mum and grandma, then aged 18, at a farm near Quorn, in South Australia's Flinders Ranges. Looking quite pensive, she is on the cusp of a full, adventurous life. Mum passed away on September 14, aged 84. Although she'd had a few heart problems just before that, she was quite fit and it was a surprise. A fiercely independent Broken Hill girl, mum was a feminist long before the term came into common use. She was working in her mid-teens (for her own money) in the mid-1940s at Fowler's Lion flour mill building, North Terrace, Adelaide, in the basement, labelling jars. She was the first in her family to own and drive a car, and travelled independently to Africa in the 1950s, England and Sri Lanka in the 1960s, and Europe, the US and Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s. Her \"no nonsense/get on with it\" attitude to life seemed harsh at times and we learnt the hard way she wasn't to be messed with when we were young. But we saw it was for good reason as we grew older. And she changed, too, as she grew older and became more liberal, and we saw a much lighter side of her persona. Her long career in nursing and midwifery enhanced this outlook. She would never say an unplanned pregnancy was a \"mistake\" or \"unfortunate\" or \"unexpected\". To her it was a \"surprise\". And she never forgot some of the children she helped deliver. She was very much: \"Lead your own life, but if you want my help, I'm here, and I want you to know, I love you\" in her later life. She took a few hits, the biggest being watching her beloved husband Gordon battle leukaemia, a fight he ultimately lost in 1985. But she always managed to pick herself up, brush herself off and get on with it after each one. She was a shoulder to cry on, a trusted confidante and a wise head in troubled times and always up for a smoke (until 12 years ago) and a game of Canasta or Bolivia. We owe her a lot. Mum is sorely missed. \u2014 by Robert Furber Paul Manson: Born 1955 \"Known to all as 'Manson', Paul always found the goodness, the humour in any situation and never failed to share it. Vale my friend...\" Paul Manson passed away on the last day of 2015, spending an even 60 years on the planet. He left behind a wife, son, daughter in-law and grand-daughter. He left behind a legion of friends across a lifetime of interests, local community, music, paramedics, and of course motorcycling. I know their sense of loss will be profound. Mine is. I met Paul 27 years ago, as a freshly minted ambo learning about life on Campsie's 'mean streets'. He became my training officer, then mentor, then mate. We worked together on and off for the next three and a half years, where he taught me not to take things too seriously, until you needed to. Then there was no excuse but to give it your all. His moral compass was always true, his observations accurate. He could deliver a brutal assessment of an issue, then 20 minutes later, bring a coffee, smile and talk about next week's motorcycle GP. There was never any bullshit. Unknowingly he provided the template for being better at my job and being a better person. He moved to the country town where his wife grew up, forging the next chapter of his life there. We talked on the phone, catching up on wives, work, kids then eventually grandkids. Laughing like drains at the good old days, laughing harder at life's rich comedy and the bit parts we played in it. Paul's unbridled joy in just living was infectious. I never had a conversation with him that didn't end in sore ribs and a grin like a split melon. During 2014 he became unwell. Late that year he was flown to a Sydney Hospital, unconscious and critically ill. Despite the odds, he rallied and responded to treatment, leaving the ward in remission seven months later; returning to his family and his motor bikes \u2014 the true loves of his life. But it came back about a month ago. Insidious and relentless. He called to tell me. We spoke about the diagnosis, about what it meant. We spoke about the unforgiving, unimaginable brutality of the treatment. And we spoke about the future and how he would get there. We signed off as we always did: \"Love ya, mate\". 2 weeks later he was gone. I'll miss him. We all will. Rest In Peace, Paul \u2014 by Brett Davison Denis Lloyd Hoye: Born 1929 \"These boots saved the town, worked hard on the sporting field and carried him many kilometres. Now they are unlaced and unworn.\" Boots being laced up always remind me of him. They were laced in preparation for a Saturday afternoon on the football or hockey field, bowling green or tennis court, or simply to begin his daily run which, with the passing years, became a walk and then a shuffle as he followed his regular daily exercise routine. By the time that his 80th birthday had arrived, his name was already listed as a life member of three sporting clubs in Bundanoon and he was still a force to be reckoned with on the tennis court. Those boots had also woken us from a heavy slumber as he answered the fire siren in the middle of the night. As captain of the local fire brigade, he could be called out at all hours. We would fall back to sleep once again, comforted by the fact that the town was safe in Poppy's hands. This year, those boots were finally quietened and the laces left untied. He had played his last tennis game, tended his final fire. Denis Lloyd Hoye was gone. Only memories remain. No more will we hear the welcome of his smile as he answered the phone to our call. No more would we see his joy when we arrived, after a long drive, to spend a few days with him. No more would we see him struggle to hear our conversations as his hearing worsened so that he caught only a random word here and there when we all spoke. Just the memory of a family man, a man who carried the torch in two Olympic Games and in the Queens Relay. He was our Poppy, our father, our father-in-law, our inspiration. \u2014 by Ruth Hoye Beverly Jean Perrin: Born 1928 \"Beverly overcame immense physical adversity and 'got on with life'.\" Displaying selflessness, style, strength and substance, Beverly Perrin overcame immense physical adversity to raise two children and grandchildren, while supporting her husband's career and working for charities. Born in Ballarat in 1928, her parents separated when Bev was three. She had no further contact with her father, Alex King. She and her mother Vera lived with her grandmother, Margaret Berriman. Her mother married William Allan in 1947 and her half-brother, Bill, was born in 1950. Bev trained as a nurse at the Ballarat Hospital. In 1951 she transferred to Hampton Children's Hospital as the charge nurse of the polio ward where she worked with rehabilitation pioneer Dame Jean McNamara. At Hampton Bev met and married Bruce Perrin, a trainee hospital administrator and in 1955 they followed work to Ballarat. During childbirth, in 1955, Bev suffered a stroke requiring neurosurgery in Melbourne. At the insistence of the Ballarat Hospital nurses the baby, Simon, was billeted for three months in their maternity ward. On discharge home, Bev was left with a dense right-sided hemiplegia. Bruce and Vera devoted themselves towards Bev's recovery, Vera undertaking the daytime supporting role. Dame Jean supervised Bev's rehabilitation in Melbourne twice yearly. Shortly after Bruce was appointed manager of Swan Hill Hospital in 1957, Bev ceased rehabilitation and 'got on with life'. In 1959 they moved to the Wangaratta Hospital and Bev learnt to drive, write, cook, paint, garden, sew and knit again. She worked for charity, school committees, the mothers' club, the church, Meals on Wheels, Rotary, Save the Children Fund and learnt Italian. In 1969 she and Bruce adopted their daughter, Donna Louise. In 1974 Bruce became CEO of the Anne Caudle Centre, Bendigo and Bev volunteered for Lifeline until her mother Vera needed her care. In 1980 she helped establish and operate the Forest Street Creative Living Program enabling the disadvantaged to learn household skills. Bev retired in the 1990s and, despite increasing frailty, dedicated the rest of her life to family. She died suddenly at the age of 86. Her compassion and pragmatism will be missed. Beverly Jean Perrin: November 16, 1928 \u2014 June 5, 2015. \u2014 by Shelley Cohn Karen Miller: Born 1958 \"My sister and my friend.\" Karen Miller (nee Willis) was born in 1958 in Cicero, Illinois, USA where she lived until 2000 when she moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Karen was a loving, gentle soul \u2014 even on her bad days, which were many. She had a kind word, a smile and a hug to share. She dreamed with her eyes wide open, always planning to visit the Chicago area for Christmas this year. There were so many places she wanted to revisit after almost 20 years away. She loved her family and her cats \u2014 Gracie was her favourite. Karen lived a full life and will be missed forever. She will always be one of the most loving people I have known. Karen left this earth due to circumstances she could not control.] If there truly is a heaven, I hope she is there \u2014 she more than earned her place with the angels. Her wings were ready, my heart was not. \u2014 by Molly Margaret Hoye (nee Hines): Born 1930 \"Life is a game of tennis, full of love and battles but, who will be the winner?\" If you could say that a person lived their life as if they were playing a certain sport, then you could safely say that Margaret lived her life like a game of tennis. She loved the game, loved her opponents and her partner, the social aspect of the game and, of course, watching it on television. Her partners were her husband Denis, her sisters and her sons, their wives and her precious grandchildren. She served up discipline and love and taught us all to play by the rules. She taught us to play hard, to play fair and the value of perseverance. There were love matches: four great ones in total. The first of these was with Denis, a match that was to last almost 65 years but, not before a few practice games had been played by both of them! The second was her two sons, Michael and Peter whom she loved with all of her heart. Her third was their children, her grandchildren, whom she spoiled and who returned her love in full. And the final one was her family, particularly her two sisters who stood beside her at her wedding and who became the much loved aunts of her two boys. Anyone who played against her will tell you that she was a fierce and competitive player, who always played fair. A certain, competitive glint came into her eyes as you faced her across the net! But her greatest adversary, the one whom she battled against quite frequently, was cancer. Cancer first challenged her over 20 years ago. She played and won three major battles against it but, finally, with her body weakened by constant battle and strong onslaughts, she conceded defeat. On December 21, just four days before Christmas, cancer stole her away from us in the small hours of the morning, when it was still light outside and before the neighbourhood rooster had summonsed the day. It was game, set and match to cancer and we, her loving family who had battled so hard beside her, had lost. I'll bet that wherever she is now, she is serving up aces and returning those volleys with as much vigour as she can! \u2014 by Ruth Hoye Joe Healion: Born 1996 \"My nephew, my sister's boy, my children's cousin... gone too soon.\" A year I'd sooner forget, 2015, started with a phone call from my husband on June 23, which is also my youngest daughter Hannah's birthday. \"Are you sitting down? Is there someone with you?\" No and No. \"It's Joe \u2014 he's been killed in a motorcycle accident.\" Disbelief. How could this happen to my sister? She had only lost her husband to an accident two years before. Joe was her middle boy. Joe was big in life, big in personality. Joe was a 'very very naughty boy' (Monty Python quote). He had talent and conviction, he knew right from wrong. He had loved, he had lived. I truly think he had something do to with the fact that Soundwave got cancelled, an event he lived for. And he could play. Boy, could he play guitar. He loved his mom and the tears won't get easier. Too many young lives taken so soon. Risk needs to be taught at a young age, not only to the boys on their new motorcycles \u2014 but to the car drivers that hit them. Love you Joe. Life will never be the same without you in our family. \u2014 by BeccT Brian Smarrelli: Born 1957 \"In our adult years we drifted apart. The cherished memories of my cousin Brian spring from childhood.\" Although I don't remember the exact date, I vividly recalled the phone call I received from my cousin Robert. We don't keep in touch as often as we should and I was pleased to hear from him. I sensed his news was going to be something totally unexpected: 'Brian has passed away'. 'You're kidding!' was my immediate reaction. 'No, I'm afraid not'. Stunned I blabbered out asking the when, why, where and how his brother died. None of it made sense because their sister Annette had passed away five years earlier. The last time I met up with Brian was in the city about two years ago. He had a lot of family photos of our Italian relatives and wanted my help placing their names. Bundled into this collection were also pictures from our childhood \u2014 the many moments his father captured of us five kids together. Where did those years go? It seems like it was only yesterday when my parents travelled from the northern suburbs of Melbourne to Kew where Uncle Tony (mum's brother) lived with his wife Aunty Doris and their three children. These visits were a treat for Joseph and me. We were the same age as our cousins although Annette was the youngest. We took turns riding my brother's home-made billy cart down the steep footpaths that existed everywhere their side of Kew. During our later primary school years, sand replaced bitumen. My uncle had a holiday house at Edithvale and our gang of five would spend a day at the beach during summer. Brian always joined in every game but I remembered him being the quietest, a thoughtful thinker. Brian was a gentle soul. Memories of us playing together are the ones I hold in my heart forever. \u2014 by Concetta McFall Brett Robins: Born 1971 \"Most notable were the comments left by the young sportsmen Brett encouraged and inspired with his enthusiasm.\" In late 2014, I interviewed Brett Robins for the ABC Open Project 'Unsung Hero'. The project involved interviewing someone who contributed in a big way to the community. Brett was the first person who came to mind. Before I could post the interview online, Brett unexpectedly passed away leaving the close knit community of Margaret River stunned. Facebook was littered with emotion from the community and the many lives Brett touched. Most notable were the comments left by the young sportsmen Brett encouraged and inspired with his enthusiasm: mentor, second father, mate. At the local junior football AGM all eyes were cast down, hands in pockets, feet shuffling when nominations for president were called for. The silence was unbearable. Brett broke it with, 'I'll do it'. Brett Robins, aged 43, had his own accounting business in Margaret River where he lived with his wife Erica and their three kids. Enthusiastic, well organised and efficient, Brett was passionate about sport. His friends called him the GM. There were three emails from Brett in my inbox about the junior football. At least one of them contained a well-executed spreadsheet. I opened it and discovered an almost-empty roster to man the Ag Show gates for fundraising. As usual volunteers were light on. Brett's name appeared in six of the one hour slots. Brett recalled volunteering for the Activ Foundation in Esperance when he was 19. His dad passed away early, but his mum always volunteered. \"Mum was registrar of our Junior Footy Club for 12 years,\" Brett told me. \"She has been recently the head volunteer for the Dalai Lama's visit to Perth, been VP of Legacy, runs the Carols by the Clock Tower in Scarborough and thousands of others over.\" President of the junior footy club, president of the BMX club, president of the junior cricket club and coach of the under 13s Association football team were a few of the many roles Brett volunteered for. When asked what is the worst thing about volunteering, he said: \"Conflict; there have been occasions where parents (ugly parent syndrome) make the roles unbearable, and can put you in an awful situation.\" But the reward is... \"Seeing the sporting clubs grow and prosper, meeting like-minded people, learning how to deal with people you would not normally deal with,\" Brett said. At the local Junior Cricket AGM all eyes were cast down, hands in pockets, feet shuffling when nominations for president were called. The silence was unbearable. Brett broke it with an enthusiastic 'I'll do it'. A year on, a photo of Brett handed out at his funeral still adorns our fridge, a healthy reminder of how to live life \u2014 to the full, with joy, with enthusiasm and tireless energy for your own kids and the kids of the community. \u2014 by Chiara Bailey Kathryn 'Kay' Walsh (nee Johnston): Born 1932 \"If you've never met a Bostonian, read this.\" She was 15 years my mother's senior, the reluctant matriarch. She was a dyed-in-the-wool Bostonian \u2014 an ocean-lover and Kennedy Democrat, both ladylike and blunt. She said she never felt so homesick as when she lived in Texas. Their manners, their Southern friendliness, their Jesus-loving ways all smacked of the worst sin in her book: insincerity. She fell in love with a tall, dark and handsome sailor who gave her three children and a lot of heartache. Photos of them from that era belong in a Time magazine spread on World War II War Brides \u2014 her classy in cheekbones and a skirt suit, him curly-haired in a US Navy uniform. As an adult, I appreciated some of her finer points. She was never one to shy away from difficult conversations, like the time she tactfully explained to the foreign work experience student she was managing that he was expected to wear deodorant to work. She had great faith, but didn't put her religion on a pedestal. She could swear like a sailor, and in the next sentence be quoting Dickens. We shared a secret love of all things British, despite our Irish upbringing. And she had opinions on everything, from the best way to pack tissues into a handbag \u2014 \"fold and stack\" \u2014 to highway travel: \"People from Connecticut just cannot drive.\" When my third child was born, she came by once a week with a meal for us. When I was in the midst of the agonising decision to emigrate to Australia, she got it. There are still certain recipes I make that will always, even in her death, be hers \u2014 pistachio coffee cake, strawberry muffins, Irish soda bread. I will forever miss the woman who knew every chapter and verse of my story. \u2014 by Threeunder3 John Baylis: Born 1931 \"Fought what he called the monster within \u2014 motor neurone disease\". A popular and well-known Territorian, John lived his life to the full and had many grandchildren, children and great-grandchildren. He was born in the UK but jumped ship in Sydney in the 1950s. John worked as a salvage diver, croc shooter and tug master, just to name a few. He fought hard to fight his monster and rallied for voluntary euthanasia. John lost his long, hard battle of 15 years with [motor neurone disease](https://www.mndaust.asn.au/Get-informed/What-is-MND.aspx) on the March 5. Forever loved Dad. R.I.P. \u2014 by Carlene Webb Susie Ingram: Born 1971 \"A life taken away far too soon. You had so much to give.\" On November 1, my beloved partner Susie lost her battle to cancer. Susie was strong and positive through this very difficult time. After surviving breast cancer 10 years ago, it was a devastating diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and its implications. She fought selflessly and bravely, desperate for more time but accepting that the end was nearing. What you saw in Susie was what you got \u2014 intelligence, honesty, integrity, belief, determination, love, fun, dignity, kindness, compassion, a wicked sense of humour, optimism and an irrepressible spirit. Being a same-sex couple, we were unable to get married and publicly celebrate our commitment. However, that did not mean our commitment and love for each other was any less, nor our pain any less. Susie was not just an amazing partner, but a wonderful friend and a caring nurse with a sharp mind, attention to detail and deep compassion for families and colleagues she worked with. She made a point of remembering names and always made you feel unique and special. I am forever grateful that Susie did not linger in pain and distress, but died at home on All Saints Day in my arms. She will be intensely missed by me, her friends and her family but her light and sparkle will remain with us forever. Thank you for your kindness, caring and your constant voice of reason, my love. Thank you for making me a better person. Thank you for being someone I was always proud to be with and the many memories. I will always love you Susie Ingram and miss you forever \u2014 you were the one for me. Your love \u2014 by Roopali Pandey Jan Boughey (nee Black): Born 1942 \"Jan's was a life well lived, full of love and care for those around her and enjoyment in the things she did.\" While her unexpected passing, a month short of her 73rd birthday, was far too soon, those who know and love Jan know that hers was a life well lived, full of love and care for those around her and enjoyment in the things she did. Remembering her, we shared memories, such as seaside holidays at Mooloolaba with siblings and cousins as a child, fireworks in the backyard, skating on the bouncing metal floor at the Blue Moon rink in Brisbane as a teenager. Her family life with husband Vince and two sons, including the seemed curse of rainy caravan holidays, the strict instructions that her sons were to never ride motorbikes and the interesting lunches she made for her children because she admitted to throwing away her boring ones when she was at school. The many people she met and helped in her years as a doctor's receptionist and also working in the family businesses. Following the passing of Vince to cancer, her new relationship with Reg and their adventures with caravanning, boating and vintage cars, while also enjoying and caring for their 12 collective grandchildren. All through her life, there was an interest in many types of craft, a passion she shared with her mother, Grace Black. Through the many stages of her life, despite some tragedies and hard times, Jan befriended and helped many people. She leaves her family and many friends those memories to treasure. \u2014 by David Boughey [Jan Boughey (nee Black) link](https://open.abc.net.au/explore/114972) Dewayne Harland: Born 1985 \"Dewayne's happiest times in life were with what little time he had with his kids.\" Looking back on my brother as a child brings much joy to me. Dewayne was a wonderful brother, always outside with his ma. He was a great swimmer, one of those who had natural sporting abilities and his guitar skills were so beautiful. It's sad that a few moments in time changed Dewayne forever, changing his life by the choices he made. Dewayne's happiest times in life were with what little time he had with his kids. He missed and loved his angels very much. Dewayne knew he'd be his kids' angel too and he'd often say this to Mum and I. We are so blessed too that of the past nine or so months, we spent it with Dewayne. He was so gentle and softly spoken, so polite. He would call me from jail and I hated this, though looking back, it kept him clean and free from that high. He had tried many times to give up but after leaving jail, he was dead within a month. To this day, we are left with questions, but I know that drugs numbed the pain for Dewayne and peace is what he wanted. He didn't have the life most people take for granted \u2014 he didn't get to live a normal adult life and experience its joys. The tears flood some days. I take solace in knowing Dewayne is at peace. Dewayne wasn't another junkie. He was my brother who I loved dearly but he was lost. If only he could have seen some self-worth. \u2014 by Kristy Harland with Lloyd Copper Kaye Boulton (nee Metcalf): Born 1945 \"How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.\" This photo was taken at our last family lunch with Mum. We always enjoyed having lunches out together and although she was very sick, we didn't know that it would be our last outing with her. The whole family was there: mum, her two daughters, and her four grandchildren. We went to a local bistro and mum wore her new wig that we had bought her \u2014 it was a bargain and mum always loved a bargain! We were all in good spirits; mum was making jokes and laughing and we really just made the most of all being together. After we had finished eating our main course we all decided to order a dessert as well, something that we almost never did. This made our lunch even more special and enjoyable and something that we will always remember. It's funny how even the smallest things can become the best memories. Mum remained strong and courageous until the end, never wanting us to worry about her. Over the last 11 months that she has been gone, there hasn't been an hour go by that we haven't thought of her and missed her terribly. Her selfless love for us and for her grandchildren was unconditional. She was our best friend, our inspiration and everything that we both hope to be, as women and as mothers. We love you Mum. \"How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard,\" - A.A Milne \u2014 by LWoods Brendan Augustine McCuskey: Born 1927 \"Darling Daddio loved to go. A traveller, a driver, an adventurer.\" Darling Daddio loved to go. A traveller, a driver, an adventurer. He loved to tease, riddle and confound. He kept us guessing for many years about exactly what it was that went over the water, under the water, through the water, but never got wet. A clue: Recently he made what he called an egg flip for Brigid and Fagyn, two of his fifteen grandchildren. The girls thought it was a milkshake. Turns out it was two raw eggs with a splash of milk. Brigid declined but Fagyn drank hers, then did a handstand, telling Poppy that was her idea of an egg flip. Dad laughed until he cried. He loved his tech. If you didn't respond immediately by email, he would text, if you didn't respond immediately he was on the phone, if you didn't respond immediately he was in the car and up your driveway wondering where you had got to. He taught me to use a super 8 camera, and I taught him to film with his phone. He said I had given him the world when I taught him to use an iPad. Hope he realised he had already given me the world! He loved his five daughters, and their arguments about who exactly was 'his girl'. Proof lies in a recent birthday card where he wrote: \"You are not My Best Girl, My Favourite Girl, My Darling Girl, My Only Girl; But Girl of My Heart, and Mum's. Love Dad\" My name is written on the envelope, but not on the card. Another conundrum! Dad loved new ideas, kicking off 'Friday Family Night', for all the family to gather. Early at the inaugural event my sister Colleen and I were having a glass of wine with Mum and Dad. \"Well\" Dad announced \"that's it. We are never doing this again!\" \"Why?\" Colleen asked. \"There's no-one here!\" Dad answered. He meant his precious, much adored sons Tyrone and Paul weren't there. And he loved his new country. Ireland was his 'back home', but Australia was the country he choose, the country he always said he came into with his shirt on. Miss you Dad. Love the girl of your heart. \u2014 by Erin McCuskey Credits - Reporting, production: [Jennifer King](/news/jennifer-king/5750332), ABC Open producers across the country - Project leads: Jane Curtis, Charmaine Ingram, Jeff Licence, Sarah Moss, Susan Standen, Lara van Raay - Design and development: Ben Spraggon, Purvis, Terri-Anne Kingsley, Matthew Liddy This article contains content that is not available.
