All plants and animals are entrained to their rhythm. There are cultures that worship the moon and others that gauge time and orient their livelihoods by it. Nearly every culture views the moon as a symbol, and quite logically, many see it as a symbol of change. Borrowing from a number of sources and considerable personal experience, this four-part blog series of Essential Oils and Lunar Phases identify essential oils that correspond well with the different phases of the moon and corresponding ceremonies, and more specifically, the intentions that are associated with each lunar phase. For example, the full moon is a time to let go of what no longer serves us and the new moon is a time for new beginnings. Using [subtle aromatherapy](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/what-is-subtle-aromatherapy/) (energetic or vibrational attributes of essential oils) and essential oils' effects on the mind and emotions, specific essential oils can be selected and used to support the intentions of each moon phase and associated ceremonies. Complementary essential oils or blends can be diffused during the lunar phase or added to a lunar ritual, ceremony, or celebration. This blog series will look at four phases of the moon: the new moon, waxing moon, full moon, and waning moon. But, it should be noted that the cycles of the moon are sometimes further broken down to include more phases such as black moon or half moon. This is a common Wicca tradition. For some, each full moon that rises throughout the year on a nearly monthly cycle has its own distinctive qualities and symbolism. In this blog series, we cover just the main four phases without distinguishing seasonal variation in moons. Here, we also, focus on the subtle aromatherapy attributes of essential oils. We also explain how to use an essential oil or blend. All lunar phases represent some aspect of transition - beginnings, adjustments, releases, etc. I personally feel that all transitions benefit from some energetic clearing ( [smudging](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/definitions/#s)) so I always use a few essential oils that do this well. Those that immediately come to mind are: - Cedar (Cedrus atlantica) - Juniper berry - Utah juniper (Juniperus osteoperma) See my blogs for some additional information on clearing or [smudging with essential oils](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/energy-work/smudging-using-diffuser-oils-for-energy-work-clearing/), [liquid smudges](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/aromatherapy-products/liquid-smudge-for-energy-clearing/), [basic, inexpensive diffusers](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/essential-oil-diffusers-for-beginners-which-one-to-use-and-how-to-use-it/), and my eBook [Clearing Energy With Smudging](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/energy-clearing-with-smudging/). New Moon A quick confession. This is actually a photo of a waxing crescent moon, just a sliver of the moon. A photo of the new moon would be black with no moon and no image at all. So, I've taken a little license using this image. The new moon is about beginnings. It's a time to start a new activity, buy or invest in something new, change jobs or adopt a new behavior (learn a skill, start a diet, etc). It's also a good time to reflect on your true purpose and what new steps you could take toward that aim. Because the new moon is about beginnings and change, it is inherently hopeful, optimistic, and action-oriented. Filled with outward energy, the new moon is yang in nature; although, one would hope not without some inward (yin) reflection. Unfortunately, the outcome of change is uncertain, and this uncertainty can create some apprehension, insecurity, and anxiety. So, there are two sides to the new moon, and each person and situation can possess a combination of hope and fear associated with the transition. Essential Oils for the New Moon When choosing essential oils for the new moon and new moon ceremonies, I look for those that release blockages and allow the transition to take place; that cultivate openness, action, and enthusiasm toward new experiences; and that calm and allay any reservations, fears or anxieties associated with change and the unknown. Fundamental to the choice is the context and the mental and emotional status of the person making the transition or participating in a new moon ceremony. Some essential oils that I frequently select are: - Cardamom nobile) - Tangerine (Citrus reticulata blanco) Cypress is a classic new moon essential oil. It's cleansing and grounding and creates a constructive atmosphere for evaluating choices. It's particularly helpful with difficult or painful transitions because it instills inner strength and confidence, calms the mind and emotions, reduces anxiety, and uplifts the spirits. Myrrh has many of the same attributes as cypress. It also unifies the chakra as well as the spiritual with the physical. Tangerine and orange are also great choices. Both are uplifting and optimistic. They bring emotional vitality to transitions. Tangerine allows one to realize change without a great amount of anxiety, drama, or trauma. Orange helps one detach from drama, expel negativity and feel confident and courageous. It releases negativity and draws in positive energy. Nutmeg is similar to tangerine and orange in that it creates enthusiasm and an appetite for adventure. It releases the old energy, behavior, and thought patterns that are no longer of service, and prepares one for the new. It creates a welcoming foundation. Galbanum sheds light on one's life purpose and offers a new perspective. Cardamom encourages openness and a thirst for new ideas. Ginger has a sharp, crisp fragrance like cardamon and it too creates drive and action and helps one overcome procrastination. Several other essential oils may be appropriate where there is resistance to change. Jasmine, Frankincense (Bowellia cateri), and tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) create ease in transitions and reduce the fear and irritability that sometimes accompanies change. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) promotes the flow of chi and encourages balance or rebalance following an adjustment. Using the New Moon Essential Oil or Blend How do you know that a New Moon is approaching? The new moon is when there is no visible moon in the sky. The new moon follows a waxing moon. There are two simple ways to determine if the New Moon is approaching. - When the moon is present at dawn, the moon is waning a New Moon is approaching. - When the moon's dark or incomplete on the right side and the moon is darkening from right to left, the moon is waning and a New Moon is approaching. The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere: the moon is incomplete on the left and darkens from left to right. How one uses a new moon blend of essential oils varies with beliefs and spiritual practices. Essential oils, essential oil blends, or dried herbs of the same plant or botanical specie can be added to the ceremonies. Note that it's important to [know the botanical name of the plant species](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/essential-oils-and-botanical-names-why-it-matters/) because you want the specific healing properties of that specie in particular. Dried herbs can be burnt along with traditional smudging herbs or sticks. Essential oils should not be burnt. They can be diffused using a proper essential oil diffuser (see our [beginner's guide to simple inexpensive diffusers](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/essential-oil-diffusers-for-beginners-which-one-to-useand-how-to-use-it/)). Diffuser oil can be added to any ceremonial space. Just a few drops of the blend will be sufficient because less is more when it comes to subtle aromatherapy. However, a ceremony isn't necessary. One can simply set an intention for the lunar phase and use the diffuser oils during the phase. The blend can be diffused a couple of days before the lunar phase begins for preparation and a couple of days after for continuity. Personal Inhalers provide an easy, convenient way to carry the blend with you over a few days during the lunar phase of choice. The supportive scent can be inhaled wherever desired. Essential oils can be added to ritual baths. Baths are often the ritual of choice with the moon because of the intrinsic relationship between the moon and water. Make sure to use these wonderfully powerful natural substances safely. Choose the right essential oils, use only a few drops, and use a dispersant to assure that the oils and water mix or emulsify. For more detailed instructions, see our blog post on using [essential oils in the bath](https://www.starchaser-healingarts.com/aromatherapy-essential-oils-in-the-bath-safety-tips/). With or without a new moon ceremony, always set a clear positive intention. Perhaps write the intention down and place it in a special place: in a Reiki box, under a crystal grid, or in some other special box or dish. It doesn't matter where you place it as long as the space is treated as a special place (or a sacred place) with a special or designated purpose. Want help "}
