Sr. Commissioning Editor left blank\" Like the first edition, the second edition of Textbook of Microbiology and Immunology consists of six sections. Section I and II deal with general micro biology and immunology, respectively. Section III, IV, and V deal with bacteriology, virology, and mycology, respec-tively. Lastly, Section VI deals with applied microbiology and includes epidemiology and control of community infections, hospi tal infections, antimicrobial chemotherapy, water analysis, and immunization.Medical microbiology is a rapidly changing and evolving field. The threat of emerging and reemerging pathogens and the changing epidemiology of known pathogens have made it imperative that we keep abreast of the changes and developments in the field if we are to efficiently deal with them.The second edition of the Textbook of Microbiology and Immunology has been revised thoroughly and revamped to include the latest information in the field of medical microbiology. Special emphasis has been placed on molecular methods of diagnosis, which have revolutionized the diagnosis of infectious diseases and have made it possible to detect hitherto unknown and unculti - vable pathogens from clinical specimens. The problem of antimicrobial resistance with respect to emerging mechanisms, changing epidemiology, and newer ways of detection has been dealt with in detail.This text aims at not only providing basic information about microbiology and immunology, but also deals with the clinical appl i- cations of microbiology in the study of infectious diseases. In each chapter, key points are highlighted. Clinical case studies have been included so that students can evaluate their understanding of the various microbes. Photographs and pertinent line diagram s have been included to aid the learning process. The book has been trimmed down so as to include the necessary information with-out overburdening the students. This textbook aims at providing comprehensive information about microbiology and it's applications for medical students, para-medical students and workers in the field of infectious diseases. I sincerely hope the book serves this purpose and also helps in creating interest towards the subject among students.Readers' views and suggestions for further improving the book in the coming years are welcome.

It also includes the study of microbial pathogenesis, disease pathology, immunology, and epidemiology of diseases. Medical microbiology is among the most widely studied branches of Microbiology. It has given mankind a chance to ght the organisms that, at one point of time, were pure nem- esis to us. This has also provided an in-depth knowledge and in-detail understanding of the nature of pathogens that cause disease in humans. This eld of microbiology has been the precursor to the wide gamut of immunological innovations in the eld of medical science. This eld not only has helped to develop vaccines against many invading organisms, it has also, in a more holistic way, given mankind a second shot at life. Deadly and debilitating diseases like smallpox, polio, rabies, plague, etc. have been either eradicated or have become treat-able now because of the efforts of scientists and researchers in the eld of medical microbiology. Microbes are the most signi cant life forms sharing this planet with humans because of their pervasive presence. Depending on their food sources, microbes may have either bene cial roles in maintaining life or undesirable roles in causing human, animal, and plant diseases. These microbes cause frequent and often severe diseases, such as AIDS, chol-era, tuberculosis, rabies, malaria, etc. The ubiquitous pres-ence of microbes in large numbers have given rise to the many mutants, which in part are responsible for emerging diseases such as AIDS, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and multidrug-resis-tant tuberculosis (MDRTB). Historical Background Microbial diseases have undoubtedly played a major role in historical events, such as the decline of the Roman Empire and the conquest of the New World. In 1347, plague or Black Death struck Europe with a brutal force. By 1351, about 4 years later, the plague had killed one-third of the population (about 25 million people). Over the next 80 years, the disease has struck repeatedly, eventually wiping out 75% of the European population. Some historians believe that this disaster changed European culture and prepared the way for the Renaissance. This is just an example from many such epidemics, which while being devastating in their scope spared not even the high and mighty of the times. Apart from the bubonic plague, measles (now thankfully extinct) and smallpox too played their roles as epidemic diseases causing high mortality and morbidity. The rst recorded epi- demic of smallpox was in the year 1350 BC in Egypt. The dis-ease was unknown in the population of the New World until the Portuguese and Spanish explorers made their appearance. Smallpox then traveled across America, devastating the previ-ously unexposed population. It was already known at that time that the disease spreads through the skin lesions and scabs, and that survivors of the infection were immune to reinfection on further exposure. Though adopted much later in America and Europe, the practice of inoculation or variolation, whereby people were intentionally exposed to smallpox to make them immune, was already being practiced in India, China, and Africa for centuries. Microorganisms as a Cause of Disease Among various causes, the causes suggested for the occurrence of disease were the effect of supernatural phenomena like plan-etary alignments and effect of bad bodily humors; the faulty environment was also implicated. Even before microorganisms were seen, some investigators suspected their existence and responsibility for disease. Among others, the Roman philosopher Lucretius (about 98-55 BC) and the physician Girolamo Fracastoro (1478-1553 AD) suggested that disease was caused by invisible living creatures. Fracastoro was much more than an author of the popular poem on syphi-lis. In his book \"De contagione, contagiosis morbis et curatione Contagion, Contagious Diseases, and their Treatment),\" pub-lished in 1546, he proposed the revolutionary theory that infec-tious diseases are transmitted from person to person by minute invisible particles. He further suggested that infections spread from person to person by minute invisible seeds, or seminaria, that are self-replicating and act on the humors of the body to cause disease. His theories were ahead of their time, and it took about 200 years for the microscope to be invented and his theo-ries to be proved. Chap-01.indd 3 5/14/2012 12:54:30 PMSection Chapter 1Antony van Leeuwenhoek: The Microscopist The rst person to observe and describe microorgan- isms accurately was an amateur microscopist Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) of Delft, Holland. Leeuwenhoek earned his living as a draper and haberdasher (a dealer in men's clothing and accessories), but spent much of his spare time constructing simple microscopes composed of double convex glass lenses held between two silver plates. His micro-scopes could magnify around 50-300 times. It is believed that he may have illuminated his liquid specimens by placing them between two pieces of glass and shining light on them at 45-degree angle to the specimen plane. This would have provided a form of dark- eld illumination and made bacte- ria clearly visible. In 1673, Leeuwenhoek sent detailed letters describing his discoveries to the Royal Society of London. It is clear from his descriptions that he saw both bacteria and protozoa. But he did not evaluate these organisms as agents of disease. Theory of Spontaneous Generation There was a considerable controversy surrounding the origin of microbial pathogens. Some proposed that microorganisms originated from nonliving things by spontaneous generation even though larger organisms did not (theory of spontaneous generation). They pointed out that boiled extracts of hay or meat would give rise to microorganisms after sometime. Needham (1713-1781) on the basis of his experiments pro-posed that all organic matter contained a vital force that could confer the property of life to nonliving matter. Louis Pasteur: Father of Microbiology Louis Pasteur, French Microbiologist, is known as the father of medical microbiology for his immense contributions to the eld of medical microbiology. He rst coined the term \"micro- biology\" for the study of organisms of microscopic size. Many of his important contributions are discussed below. Germ theory of disease Many other scientists have contributed to the theory of spon-taneous generation with their experiments, but it was Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) who settled it once for all. Pasteur rst ltered air through cotton and found that objects resem- bling plant spores had been trapped. If a piece of cotton was placed in a sterile medium after air had been ltered through it, microbial growth appeared. Next he placed nutrient solu-tions in fl asks, heated their necks in a fl ame, and drew them out into a variety of curves, while keeping the ends of the necks open to the atmosphere. Pasteur then boiled the solutions for a few minutes and allowed them to cool. No growth took place even though the contents of the fl asks were exposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth occurred because dust and germs had been trapped on the walls of the curved necks. If the necks were broken, growth commenced immediately. By this Pasteur proved that all life even microbes arose only from their like and not de novo ( germ theory of disease ). Pasteur had not only resolved the controversy by 1861 but also had shown how to keep solutions sterile. Support for the germ theory of disease began to accumulate in the early nineteenth century. Agostino Bassi (1773-1856) rst showed that a microorganism could cause disease when he demonstrated in 1835 that the silkworm disease was due to a fungal infection. He also suggested that many diseases were due to microbial infections. In 1845, MJ Berkeley proved that the great potato blight of Ireland was caused by a fungus. Pasteurization Pasteur for the rst time demonstrated that he could kill many microorganisms in wine by heating and then rapidly cooling the wine, a process now called pasteurization. While developing methods for culturing microorganisms in special liquid broths, Pasteur discovered that some microorganisms require air, speci cally oxygen, while others are active only in the absence of oxygen. He called these organisms as aerobic and anaerobic organisms, respectively. Vaccination In 1877, Pasteur studied anthrax, a disease mainly of cattle and sheep. He developed a vaccine using a weakened strain of the anthrax bacillus, Bacillus anthracis. He attenuated the culture of anthrax bacillus by incubation at high temperature of 42-43\u00b0C and inoculated the attenuated bacilli in the animals. He dem-onstrated that animals receiving inoculation of such attenu-ated strains developed speci c protection against anthrax. The success of this concept of immunization was demonstrated by a public experiment on a farm at Pouilly-le-Fort in the year 1881. In that public demonstration, he vaccinated sheeps, goats, and cows with anthrax bacillus attenuated strains, but equal numbers of these animals were nonvaccinated. All the vaccinated as well as nonvaccinated animals were subsequently challenged with a virulent anthrax bacillus culture, after which only the vaccinated animals survived whereas nonvaccinated group of animals died of anthrax. In 1885, he also developed the rst vaccine against rabies in humans that saved millions of human life worldwide. Pasteur coined the term \"vaccine\" to commemorate Edward Jenner who used such preparations for protection against smallpox. The Pasteur Institute, Paris and subsequently sim-ilar institutions were established in many countries of the world for the preparation of vaccines and for the study of infectious diseases. Control of silkworm disease Following his successes with the study of fermentation, Pasteur was asked by the French government to investigate the cause of p\u00e9brine disease of silkworms that was disrupt-ing the silk industry. After several years of work, he showed that the disease was due to a protozoan parasite. The disease was controlled by raising caterpillars from eggs produced by healthy moths. Chap-01.indd 4 5/14/2012 12:54:30 PMSection III Chapter 43HISTORY OF I Chapter 1Joseph Lister: The Pioneer of Antiseptics Indirect evidence that microorganisms are the agents of human disease came from the work of an English surgeon Joseph Lister (1827-1912) on the prevention of wound infections. Lister, impressed with Pasteur's studies on the involvement of microorganisms in fermentation and putrefaction, developed a system of antiseptic surgery designed to prevent microorgan-isms from entering wounds. Instruments were heat sterilized and phenol was used on surgical dressings and at times sprayed over the surgical area. The approach was remarkably successful and transformed surgery after Lister published his ndings in 1867. It also provided strong indirect evidence for the role of microorganisms in disease because phenol, which killed bacte-ria, also prevented wound infections. Robert Koch: The Founder of Koch's Postulates The rst direct demonstration of the role of bacteria in causing disease came from the study of anthrax by the German physi-cian Robert Koch (1843-1910). Koch used the criteria proposed by his former teacher, Jacob Henle (1809-1885), to establish the relationship between B. anthracis and anthrax, and he published his ndings in 1876 briefl y describing the scienti c method he followed. In this experiment, Koch injected healthy mice with a material from diseased animals, and the mice became ill. After transferring anthrax by inoculation through a series of 20 mice, he incubated a piece of spleen containing the anthrax bacil-lus in beef serum. The bacilli grew, reproduced, and produced spores. When the isolated bacilli or spores were injected into mice, anthrax developed. During Koch's studies on bacterial diseases, it became nec- essary to isolate suspected bacterial pathogens. His criteria for proving the causal relationship between a microorganism and a speci c disease are known as Koch's postulates. Koch's postulates Koch's postulates (criteria) were useful to prove the claim that a microorganism isolated from a disease was indeed causally related to it. A microorganism was accepted as the causative agent of infectious disease, only when it satis ed all the follow-ing criteria (Fig. 1-1): 1. The microorganism must be present in every case of the disease but absent from healthy host. 2. The suspected microorganism must be isolated and gro wn in a pure culture from lesions of the disease.

Koch's postulates. Chap-01.indd 5 5/14/2012 12:54:30 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 6Section I Chapter 1 3. The isolated organism, in pure culture, when inoculated in suitable laborator y animals should produce a similar disease. 4. The same microorganism must be isolated again in pure culture from the lesions produced in experimental animals. The speci c antibodies to the bacterium should be demonstra- ble in the serum of patient suffering from the disease. This was an additional criterion that was introduced subsequently. Most of the human bacterial pathogens satisfy Koch's postulates except for those of Mycobacterium leprae Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of leprosy and syphilis, respectively. Both these bacteria are yet to be grown in cell-free culture media. Solid medium for culture of bacteria Koch pioneered the use of agar as a base for culture media. He developed the pour plate method and was the rst to use solid culture media for culture of bacteria. This development made possible the isolation of pure cultures that contained only one type of bacterium and directly stimulated progress in all areas of bacteriology. Koch also developed media suitable for grow-ing bacteria isolated from the body. Because of their similarity to body fl uids, meat extracts and protein digests were used as nutrient sources. The result was the development of nutrient broth and nutrient agar media that are still in wide use today. By 1882, Koch had used these techniques to isolate the bacil-lus that caused tuberculosis in humans. Koch also discovered that cholera was caused by Vibrio cholerae. He invented the hot air oven and steam sterilizer, and also introduced methods to nd out the ef cacy of antiseptics. There followed a golden age of about 30-40 years in which most of the major bacterial pathogens were isolated. Koch's phenomenon Koch's phenomenon is a hypersensitivity reaction against tuberculosis bacilli demonstrated in guinea pigs. This was rst demonstrated by Koch, who showed that guinea pigs already infected with tubercle bacillus, on challenge with tubercle bacillus or its protein, developed an exaggerated infl ammatory response. Self-Experimentation Studies To study diseases in a more elaborate and controlled fashion, there were a few dedicated researchers who went to the extremes of self-experimentation. The discovery that hookworm infes-tation spread by fecal-oral route was rst demonstrated by Arthur Loos in 1898. This was known during his attempts at studying Strongyloides stercoralis by swallowing its larvae and accidentally swallowing a fecal inoculum with hookworm eggs instead! These attempts did not always have happy and produc- tive endings as is illustrated by the case of Daniel Carrion (1858-1895), a medical student in Lima, Peru. He man-aged to prove that the same organism (later identi ed to be Bartonella bacilliformis) caused a chronic skin lesion called ver-ruga peruana and another serious disease called Oroya fever. This he did by inoculating himself with material from the warts of the skin lesion. He did develop Oroya fever as he had hypothesized, but the experiment costed him his life when he succumbed to the disease. In the subsequent 50 years, numer-ous microorganisms were identi ed as the causative agents of important human diseases and their discovery elucidated (Table 1-1). Study of Viruses In 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky, a Russian scientist working in St. Petersburg, demonstrated that the sap of leaves infected with tobacco mosaic disease retains its infectious properties even after ltration through Chamberland lter candles. This was an important observation, because it provided an opera-tional de nition of viruses and also an experimental technique by which an agent could be considered as a virus. Beijerinck, a Dutch soil microbiologist, showed that the l- tered sap could be diluted and then regain its strength after replication in living and growing tissue of the plant. The agent could reproduce itself (which meant that it was not a toxin) but only in living tissues, not in the cell-free sap of the plant. This explained the failure to culture the pathogen outside its host. All these observations contributed immensely to the dis-covery of an organism smaller than bacteria (a lterable agent) that is not observable in the light microscope and is able to reproduce itself only in living cells or tissues. Beijerinck called this agent a contagium vivum fl uidum, or The concept of contagium vivum fl uidum or a contagious living liquid began a 25-year debate about the nature of viruses; whether they were liquids or particles? This confl ict was laid to rest when d'Herelle developed the plaque assay in 1917 and subsequent development of electron microscopy by Scientist Bacteria Year Hansen Mycobacterium agents causing human diseases Chap-01.indd 6 5/14/2012 12:54:31 PMSection III Chapter 43HISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY 7Section I Chapter 1Ruska (1934), when the rst electron micrographs of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were taken in 1939. The viruses were accepted as particles. Loeffl er and Frosch (1898) described and isolated the rst lterable agent from animals, the foot-and-mouth disease virus of cattle. Walter Reed and his team in Cuba (1902) recognized the rst human lterable virus, yellow fever virus. Landsteiner and Popper (1909) demonstrated that poliomyelitis was caused by a lterable virus and also successfully transmitted the infec- tion to monkeys. Goodpasture (1930) used chick embryos for cultivation of viruses. The term virus (taken from the Latin for slimy liquid or poison) was at that time used interchangeably for any infectious agent and so was applied to TMV and then further to all agents of the class. d'Herelle and Twort: Founders of the Principles of Modern Virology Twort and d'Herelle (1915) independently observed a lytic phenomenon in bacterial cultures, which they attributed to viruses. d'Herelle named these viruses as bacteriophages. He developed the use of limiting dilutions with the plaque assay to titer the virus preparation. He suggested that the appearance of plaques in the plaque assay show the viruses to be particulate, or corpuscular. d'Herelle also demonstrated that the attachment (adsorp- tion) of the virus to the host cell is the rst step in the pathogen-esis of a virus infection. The attachment of a virus occurred only when bacteria sensitive to the virus were mixed with it, demon-strating the host range speci city of a virus at the adsorption step. He described the process of cell lysis and subsequently the release of infectious virus particles. He developed many other techniques that are still used in virology. d'Herelle was in many ways one of the founders of the principles of modern virology. Phenomenon of Immunity The earliest written reference to the phenomenon of immunity can be traced back to Thucydides, the great historian of the Peloponnesian War. Describing a plague in Athens, in 430 BC, he wrote that only those who had recovered from the plague could nurse the sick because they would not contract the disease a second time. The earliest known smallpox inoculation took place in China, perhaps as early as the fth century AD. The Chinese method was reported to the Royal Society by an English mer-chant, John Lister, during early 1900s. A Jesuit priest, Father d'Entrecolles, provided details of the method, which he said was to collect scabs from the pustules and blow a powder made from them into an infant's nose. The scabs or a thread coated with the pus could be stored, but the operation was usually done face-to-face with a sick patient. The same method was used in Japan beginning in 1747. In precolonial India, a tika or dot would be made on a child, usually on the sole of the foot, by traditional tikadars who were invited into home (this professional niche was later blacklisted by colonial-era medical practitioners). The method was signi cantly improved by the English phy- sician Edward Jenner in 1798. Jenner was intrigued by the fact that milkmaids who had contracted the mild disease cowpox were subsequently immune to smallpox, a dis guring and often fatal disease. He believed that introducing fl uid from a cowpox pustule into people (i.e., inoculating them) might protect them from smallpox. To test this idea, he inoculated an 8-year-old boy with fl uid from a cowpox pustule and later intentionally infected the child with smallpox. As predicted, the child did not develop smallpox. Pasteur followed this up with development of vaccines for chicken cholera, anthrax, and rabies. Although Pasteur proved that vaccination worked, but he did not under-stand how. Mechanisms of Immunity The experimental work of Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1890 gave the rst insight into the mechanism of immunity. They demonstrated that serum contained elements that protected against infections thus laying the foundation for the identi cation of humoral immunity. In recognition of this work, von Behring received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901. In 1884, even before the discovery that a serum component could transfer immunity, Elie Metchnikoff demonstrated that cells also contribute to the immune state of an animal. He observed that certain white blood cells, which he termed phago-cytes, were able to ingest (phagocytose) microorganisms and other foreign material. Noting that these phagocytic cells were more active in animals that had been immunized, Metchnikoff hypothesized that cells, rather than serum components, were the major effector of immunity. The active phagocytic cells identi ed by Metchnikoff were most likely blood monocytes and neutrophils. Speci city of the Antibody Molecule One of the greatest enigmas facing early immunologists was the speci city of the antibody molecule for foreign material or antigen. Following theories were proposed to explain this mechanism of speci city: 1. The selective theory: The earliest conception of the selectiv e theory dates to Paul Ehrlich in 1900. In the 1930s and 1940s, the selective theory was challenged by various instructional theories, in which antigen played a central role in determining the speci city of the antibody molecule. 2. The instructional theory: According to the instructional theories, a particular antigen w ould serve as a template around which the antibody would fold. This concept was rst postulated by Friedrich Breinl and Felix Haurowitz in the 1930s and rede ned in the 1940s in terms of protein folding by Linus Pauling. Chap-01.indd 7 5/14/2012 12:54:31 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL I Chapter 1 3. The clonal selection theory: The instructional theories w ere formally disproved in the 1960s, during which information was beginning to appear regarding the struc-ture of DNA, RNA, and protein. These information offered new insights into the vexing problem of how an individ-ual could make antibodies against almost anything. In the 1950s, selective theories resurfaced as a result of new experimental data and through the pioneering contribu-tions of Niels Jerne, David Talmadge, and F Macfarlane Burnet, who re ned into a theory that came to be known as the clonal selection theory. Chemotherapeutic Agents Until the 1930s, there had been no chemical treatment avail-able to ght bacterial infections in general. Prevention was the main means of protecting patients, and an obsession with the threat of germs and the moral responsibility to avoid infection was deeply instilled in Western cultures. At the same time, there were repeated hopes for a wonder drug. Louis Pasteur's pupil Paul Vuillemin coined the term \"antibiosis\" in 1889 to denote a process by which life could be used to destroy life. Paul Ehrlich was an exceptionally gifted histological chemist and invented the precursor technique to Gram-staining of bac-teria. He demonstrated that dyes react speci cally with various components of blood cells and the cells of other tissues. He began to test the dyes for therapeutic properties to determine whether they could kill the pathogenic microbes. He developed Salvarsan, an arsenical compound in 1909. The compound known as \"magic bullet\" was capable of destroying T. pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis. This treatment proved effective against syphilis. This work was of epochal importance, stim-ulating research that led to the development of sulfa drugs, penicillin, and other antibiotics. He, therefore, is known as the father of chemotherapy. Antibiotics The word \"antibiotic\" did not follow immediately, but the drug pyocyanase, a weakly effective antibiotic, was marketed from the late nineteenth century into the 1930s. Early in the 1920s, there was an excitement about the potential of the newly identi ed phage viruses to kill bacteria. The discovery of an antibacterial factor in the exudates of the fungus Penicillium by Sir Alexander Fleming at St. Mary's Hospital in 1928 was there-fore not totally unexpected. He accidentally discovered that a substance produced by the fungus destroyed the pyogenic bacteria, staphylococci. This initiated the beginning of the anti- biotics era. Other similar antibiotics were discovered in rapid succession. The sulfonamide drugs discovered subsequently offered cures for a wide range of bacterial infections. Introduction of antibiotics in medicine raised a lot of expec- tations among both doctors and patients. Certain terrifying infectious diseases (e.g., rheumatic fever, syphilis, pneumonia, tuberculosis) and unpleasant skin conditions (e.g., carbuncles) became easily treatable, and their disappearance appeared to be certain. Surgeons could risk more dangerous operations and the use of drugs that compromised immune systems. Patients who had once turned to many kinds of alternative medicine, or refused treatment, now entrusted themselves to antibiotics. Medical uses of antibiotics on human patients were harder to limit\u2014even though, from the 1940s, the fear that public enthusiasm would promote the selection of resistant strains did lead\u2014to some constraints. In Britain, the Penicillin Act of 1948 was explicitly intended to, for the rst time, limit through prescription the public's access to a drug that was not a poison. Nonetheless, during the 1950s, a penicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus termed 80/81 infected hospitals and mater-nity wards across the world. Newborn babies in hospital cr\u00e8ches were infected and postoperative infections proved common. By the late 1990s, although many variants of older drugs had been produced, new families of antibiotics were, however, not being discovered. However, a sustained effort is now being made to develop more effective antibiotics to treat a wide range of infections. The eld of medical microbiology has been enriched by contributions of many eminent microbiologists both in the past and in the recent times. The work of many of them has been recognized worldwide by the award of Nobel Prizes (Table 1-2).

Microorganisms are a heterogeneous group of several distinct living structures of microscopic size, classified under the kingdom Protista. The kingdom Protista includes unicellular organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, proto-zoa, and algae. Based on the differences in cellular organization and biochemistry, the kingdom Protista has been divided into three groups: prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and the most recently described archaebacteria. 1. Prokaryotes: Bacteria and blue green algae are prokary-o tes. Bacteria are unicellular free living organisms having both DNA and RNA. They are capable of performing all essential processes of life, e.g., growth, reproduction, and metabolism. They do not show any true branching except Actinomycetales, the higher bacteria. Bacteria lack chloro-phyll unlike blue green algae, which contain chlorophyll. 2. Eukaryotes: Fungi, algae other than blue green, pro tozoa, and slime moulds are eukaryotes. 3. Archaebacteria: These are more closely related to eukary-o tes than prokaryotes. They however do not include any human pathogens. Differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been summarized in Table 2-1. Size of Bacteria Bacteria are microscopic and very small in size. The size of bacteria is measured in units of length called microns. A micron (micrometer, /H9262m) is the unit 0.2-1.5 /H9262m (width). Microscopy Microscopy is an important component of diagnostic micro-biology. Bacteria being very small cannot be visualized by the naked eye, because the limit of resolution with the unaided eye is about 200 microns. So, the study of bacteria requires the use of microscopes. A microscope is an instrument that uses one or more lenses to produce a magnified image of an object that is invisible to the unaided eye. Types of Microscopy The following types of microscopy are used for the examina-tion of microorganisms including bacteria: Light microscopy Light microscopy, as the name suggests, uses natural or artificial transmitted light as the source of light. Resolving power of microscope is an important component of light microscopy. It is the ability of the lens system to distinguish two closely placed objects as distinct and separate entities. It is dependent on the wavelength of light used to illuminate the object and on the numerical aperture of the microscope. It is about half of the wavelength of light being used. For example, the smallest particle which can be resolved by yellow light with a wavelength of 0.4 /H9262m is about 0.2 /H9262 m. Proper use of condenser that focuses light on the plane of the object facilitates optimization of the resolving power of the microscope. Resolving power of the microscope is enhanced further by adjusting the medium through which light passes between the object and objective lens. The use of immersion oil, whose refractive index is similar to that of the glass, improves the resolution of the microscope. The numerical aperture of the microscope is defined as the light gathering power of the microscope. Different types of light microscopy include (a) bright-field microscopy, (b) microscop y (always referred to as ordinary light microscopy) is the most common form of light microscopy that uses a compound light micro-scope. A compound light microscope primarily consists of a compound lens system that contains a number of objective lenses, such as lenses of low power (/H1100310), high power (/H1100340), and oil immersion (/H11003100). It also contains a fixed ocular (eye piece) lens, usually of /H1100310 or /H110035. Final magnification of an object is the multiplication of lens power of the objective with that of the eye piece (Fig. 2-1). The bright-field microscopy has many uses. Morphology and Physiology of Bacteria 2 Chap-02.indd 9 5/14/2012 11:49:41 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 10Section I Chapter 2 It may be used to examine either wet films or \"hanging drop\" for demonstration of the motility of flagellated bacteria The wet prep- aration is also useful for demonstration of microorganisms in urine or feces, and also for detection of fungi in the skin. It is useful for demonstration of the structural details. It is also useful for measuring approximate size of the bacte-ria, fungi, and protozoa in stained preparations. 2. Dark-ground microscopy: The dark-ground microscopy makes use of dark-ground microscope, a special type of compound light microscope. The dark-field condenser with a central circular stop, which illuminates the object with a cone of light, is the most essential part of the dark-ground microscope. This microscope uses reflected light instead of transmitted light used in the ordinary light microscope (Fig. 2-2). It prevents light from falling directly on the objective lens. Light rays falling on the object are reflected or scattered onto the objective lens with the result that the microorganisms appear brightly stained against a dark background. The dark-ground microscopy has following uses: It is useful for demonstration of very thin bacteria (such as, spirochetes) not visible under ordinary illumination, since the reflection of the light makes them appear larger. This is a frequently used method for rapid demonstration of Treponema pallidum in clinical specimens. It is also useful for demonstration of motility of flagellated bacteria and protozoa. 3. Phase-contrast microscopy: Phase-contrast microscopy makes use of a specific optical system that converts differences Eye Ocular lens Objective lensSpecimenCondenser lensSource of light FIG. 2-1.

The optical system includes a special condenser and objec- tive lens which can be fitted to an ordinary light microscope to convert it into a phase-contrast microscope. The phase-con-trast microscopy has following uses: It is immensely useful for examination of living micro-organisms particularly protozoa (e.g., T. vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica , etc.) It is useful for examining the internal structures of a living cell by improving the contrast and differentiating structures within the cell that differs in their thickness and refractive index. 4. Interference microscopy: This is another specialized appli-cation of light microscopy used for demonstrating cell organ-elles. It is also useful for quantitative measurement of the chemical constituents of the cells, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Fluorescence microscopy Fluorescence microscopy is based on the principle that the spec-imens stained with fluorescent dye when exposed to ultraviolet light result in emission of longer wavelength of light (i.e., vis-ible light) (Fig. 2-4). The bacteria stained with fluorescent dye appear as a brightly glowing object against a dark background. Fluorescence microscopy needs a fluorescence microscope fitted with an ultraviolet light source. Auramine O, acridine orange, and rhodamine are fluorescent dyes used to visualize bacteria. The resolving power of a fluorescence microscope is increased due to the short wavelength of ultraviolet light. Auramine O, acridine orange, and rhodamine are fluorescent dyes used to visualize bacteria. Fluorescence microscopy is widely used in diagnostic microbiology in the following ways: It is used for direct demonstration of antigen of a patho-gen in clinical specimens by direct fluorescent antibody test (e.g., direct detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, etc. directly in clinical specimens). It is also used for the estimation of antibodies in the serum by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) (e.g., IFA in lepto-spirosis, syphilis, brucellosis, etc.). Electron microscopy Electron microscopy utilizes a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light used in the light microscopy. The electron beam is focused by electromagnets, analogous to the lenses used in the light microscopy. The object to be examined is kept on the path of the beam that scatters the electrons and produces an image which is focused on a screen (Fig. 2-5). The resolving power of the electron microscope is extremely high, theoretically 100,000 times than that of a light micro-scope. This is because the electron microscope uses electrons whose wavelength is approximately 0.005 nm as compared to 5000 nm wavelength of the visible light. As mentioned earlier, the resolving power is half of the wavelength. In practice, the resolving power of the electron microscope, however, is about 0.1 nm. There have been many developments in electron microscopy that include (a) shadow casting, (b) scanning elec-tron microscopy, (c) immunoelectron microscopy, and (d) freeze-etching, etc. Shadow casting is an important technique that is carried out by depositing a thin layer of platinum or other metal on the microorganism to be examined. This platinum-coated organism, on bombardment with electron beams, scatters the electron and produces an image that is focused on a fluorescent screen.Eye Ocular lens Undiffracted light unaltered by specimen Refracted light by specimen Annular diaphragmObjective lensDiffraction plate 12Section I Chapter 2 Scanning electron microscopy is another development that provides a three-dimensional image of the object as well as high resolution. Immunoelectron microscopy is a method to enhance sensi- tivity and specificity by reacting the specimen with specific antiviral antibody that results in clumping of viral particles. In this method also, antibody may be conjugated with gold to visualize and determine the location of specific antigenic determinants in a specimen. Freeze-etching is the method by which live organisms can be visualized unlike in traditional methods of electron microscopy in which living cells cannot be examined. This method is use-ful for the study of cellular ultrastructure of the microorgan-isms in the living state. This method is based on rapid cooling of specimens by deep-freezing in liquid gas and the subsequent formation of carbon platinum replica of the specimen. Electron microscope is widely used for: Rapid detection of viruses directly in clinical specimens. This is especially useful for detection of noncultivable viruses. Ultrastructural study of various microorganisms. Differences between electron microscope and light microscope are summarized in Table 2-2. Newer microscopic methods These include the following: Confocal microscopy : This is useful to obtain high resolution images and for three dimensional reconstruction of biological models. Scanning probe microscopy: This measures surface fea-tures by moving a sharp probe over the object's surface. There are two types of scanning probe microscope: (a ) scan- ning tunneling microscope and (b ) atomic force microscope.Study of Bacteria Bacteria can be studied either in unstained (wet mount) or stained preparation. The wet mount preparation is useful for demonstration of motility of bacteria by light microscopy or demonstration of spirochetes by dark-ground microscopy. Stained preparations are used to demonstrate structural details of the bacteria by producing color contrast. Staining Methods The common staining techniques used in diagnostic microbi-ology are discussed below: Simple stains Methylene blue and basic fuchsin are the simple stains that provide color contrast but impart the same color to all the bacteria in a smear. Negative staining Bacteria are mixed with dyes, such as Indian ink that produces a uniform dark-colored background against which the unstained organisms stand out in contrast. This is used for demonstration of bacterial capsule that are usually not stained by simple stains. India Ink method for demonstration of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a common example. Impregnation stains Cells and structures that are too thin to be visualized by the light microscope can be rendered visible by impregna-tion of silver on their surface. Silver impregnation method is a common method used for staining spirochetes, such as T. pallidum, Leptospira, Borrelia, etc.Scanning circuit Photo multiplierCathode ray tube for viewing Cathode ray tube for photography VACUUMVAC UU M Electron gun CondenserlensesScanningcoilPrimaryelectronsSpecimenSpecimenholderDetectorSecondaryelectrons FIG. 2-5.

The commonly used differential stains include Gram stain, acid-fast stain, and Albert's stain.Gram stain: Gram stain was devised by Christian Gram, a Danish microbiologist, in 1884, as a convenient method for classifying bac-teria. The Gram staining method essentially consists of four steps: (i) Primary staining with basic dyes, such as me thyl violet, crystal violet, etc. (ii) Application of mordant in the form of dilute solution of iodine. (iii) Decolorization with ethanol, ace tone, or aniline. (iv) Counterstaining with acidic dyes, such as carbol fuchsin, safranine, or neutral red. Key Points Gram staining is an essential procedure that is used in the identification of bacteria. The stain differentiates bacteria into two broad groups: Gram-positive bacteria are those that resist decoloriza- tion and retain the primary dye-iodine complex, appear-ing violet. They have a relatively thick amorphous wall and more acidic protoplasm which are believed to retain the basic violet dye and iodine complex within the cell. Gram-negative bacteria are decolorized by organic sol- vents and take counterstain, appearing red. The decoloriz-ing agent, such as acetone or ethanol, used during staining disrupts this membran-ous envelope, and the dye and iodine complex is washed out of Gram-negative bacteria. There are certain groups of bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuber-culosis and Mycobacterium leprae, that cannot be considered typi- cal Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. This is because these bacteria either do not take up the Gram stain or they have a different type of envelope. These mycobacteria possess a waxy envelope containing complex glycolipids that make them impervious to the Gram stain. Gram stain also provides useful information on the structure of bacterial cell envelope.Acid-fast stain: The acid-fast stain was discovered by Ehrlich, who found that after staining with aniline dyes, tubercle bacilli resist decolorization with acid. The method, subsequently, was modified by Ziehl and Neelsen, hence is widely known as Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain. Key Points Acid fast staining method consists of following methods: Fixed smears are first stained by a strong carbol fuchsin with the application of heat. Heating facilitates entry of phenolic carbol fuchsin stain into the bacteria. It is then decolorized with 5-20% (depending on the bacte-ria to be stained) sulfuric acid. It is then counterstained with a contrasting dye, such as meth-ylene blue. The acid-fast bacilli (AFB) retain the red color of carbol fuchsin and appear bright red in stained smears. Pus cells and epithelial cells present in the smear, on other hand, take up the blue color of the counterstain and appear blue.Acid fastness is due to the (a ) high content of lipids, fatty acids, components of mycolic acid, and (b ) higher alcohols found in the cell wall of the Mycobacterium. Acid fastness also depends on integrity of the cell wall. The ZN smear is best used for staining: M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, Nocardia, Actinomyces, and stain staining the volutin granules of C. diphtheriae. These granules have an affinity for basic dyes and are called metachromatic granules. These gran-ules are stained bluish-black against green protoplasm on staining by Albert's stain. Shape of Bacteria Depending on their shape, bacteria are classified into several types (Fig. 2-6):1. Cocci: The cocci (kokkos, berry) are oval or spherical cells. These may be arranged in pairs (e.g., pneumococci, menin- gococci, and gonococci), (e.g., staphylococci).2. Bacilli: The bacilli (bacillus, rod) are rod shaped. These bacilli may show either of the following arrangement: (a) Coccobacilli: Length of the bacteria is approximately the same as its width, e.g., Brucella. (b) Streptobacilli: These are arranged in chains, e.g., Strep tobacillus. (c) Comma shaped: They exhibit curv ed appearance, e.g., Vibrio. (d) Spirilla: They exhibit rigid spiral forms, e.g., Spirillum. 3. Spirochetes: Spirochetes (spira, coil; chaite, (actin, ray; mykes, fungus) are branching filamentous bacteria resembling fungi. They possess a rigid cell wall. Coccus Coccobacillus Bacillus Spirochete SpirillumFusiform bacillus Vibrio FIG. 5/14/2012 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 14Section I Chapter 2Structure and Functions of Bacterial Cell Envelope The outer layer or cell envelope provides a structural and physi-ological barrier between the protoplasm (inside) of the cell and the external environment. The cell envelope protects bacteria against osmotic lysis and gives bacteria rigidity and shape. The cell envelope primarily consists of two components: a cell wall and cytoplasmic or plasma membrane. It encloses the proto-plasm, which consists of (i) cytoplasm, (ii) cytoplasmic inclu-sions (mesosomes, ribosomes, inclusion granules, vacuoles), and (iii) a single circular DNA (Fig. 2-7). Cell Wall Prokaryotic cells almost always are bounded by a fairly rigid and chemically complex structure present between the cell membrane and capsule/slime layer called the cell wall. Peptidoglycan is the main component of the cell wall and is responsible for the shape and strength of the cell. It is a disac-charide and contains two sugar derivatives\u2014N-acetylglucos-amine and N-acetylmuramic acid\u2014joined together by short peptide chains. N-acetylmuramic acid carries a tetrapeptide side chain consisting of D- and L-amino acids ( D-glutamic acid and L-alanine) bacteria) or L-lysine (Gram-positive bacteria). Tetrapeptide side chains are interconnected by pentaglycine bridges. Most Gram-negative cell walls lack interpeptide bridge. Cell wall provides shape to the cell and protects bacteria from changes inosmotic pressure, which within the bacteria cell measures 5-20 atmospheres. Bacterial cells can be classified into Gram-positive or Gram-negative based on the structural differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. The cell walls of the Gram-positive bacteria have simpler chemical structures compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive cell wall The Gram-positive cell wall is thick (15-80 nm) and more homogenous than that of the thin (2 nm) Gram-negative cell wall. The Gram-positive cell wall contains large amount of peptidoglycan present in several layers that constitutes about 40-80% of dry weight of the cell wall (Fig. 2-8). The Gram-positive cell wall consists primarily of teichoic and teichuronic acids. These two components account for up to 50% of the dry weight of the wall and 10% of the dry weight of the total cell.1. Teichoic acids: Teichoic acids are polymers phosphate containing ribitol and glycerol. These polymers may have sugar or amino acid substi-tutes, either as side chain or within the chain of polymer.Teichoic acids are of two types\u2014wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acids (LTA). They are connected to the peptidoglycan by a covalent bond with the six hydroxyl of N-acetylmuramic acid in the WTA and to plasma membrane lipids in LTA. Key Points Teichoic acids have many functions: They constitute major surface antigens of those Gram- positive species that possess them. In Streptococcus pneu-moniae, the teichoic acids bear the antigenic determinants called Forssman antigen. In Streptococcus pyogenes, LTA is associated with the M protein that protrudes from the cell membrane through the peptidoglycan layer. The long M protein molecules together with the LTA form microfibrils that facilitate the attachment of S. pyogenes to animal cells; They are also used as antigen for serological classification of bacteria; They serve as substrates for many autolytic enzymes; They bind magnesium ion and may play a role in supply of this ion to the cell; They play a role in normal functioning of the cell wall and provide an external permeability barrier to Gram-positive bacteria; and Membrane teichoic acid serves to anchor the underlying cell membrane. 2. Teichuronic acid: Teichuronic acid consists of repeat units of sugar acids (such as N-acetylmannuronic or D-glucuronic acid). They are synthesized in place of teichoic acids when phosphate supply to the cell is limited. Gram-positive cell wall also contains neutral sugars (such as mannose, arabinose, rhamnose, and glucosamine) and acidic sugars (such as glucuronic acid and mannuronic acid), which occur as subunits of polysaccharides in the cell wall. Gram-negative cell wall The Gram-negative cell wall is much more complex than the Gram-positive cell wall. Peptidoglycan content in the Gram-negative cell wall is significantly less than the Gram-positive cell wall. Only 1-2 layers of peptidoglycan (2-8 nm) are present just outside the cell membrane. The Gram-negative cell wall outside the peptidoglycan layer contains three main components\u2014(a) lipoprotein layer, (b) outer membrane, and (c) lipopolysaccharides (Fig. 2-9).Lipoprotein layer: The lipoprotein layer is mainly Braun's Braun's lipoprotein is a small lipoprotein that is covalently joined to the underlying peptidoglycan and embedded in the outer membrane by its hydrophobic end.

Schematic diagram of the cell wall of the Gram-positive bacteria. Outer membrane Periplasmic (Pore)Lipopolysaccharide FIG. diagram the cell wall of the Gram-negative bacteria. The lipoprotein stabilizes the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall.Outer membrane: The outer membrane is a bilayered structure; its inner part resembles in composition with that of the cell membrane, while its outer part contains a distinctive component called lipopolysaccharide. The outer membrane and plasma membrane appear to be in direct contact at many sites in the Gram-negative wall. The outer membrane has a variety of proteins as follows: (a) Porins: The outer membrane has special channels consist-ing of protein molecules called porins. These porins ha ve many functions: They permit the passive diffusion of low-molecular weight hydrophilic compounds, such as sugars, amino acids, and certain ions; They exclude hydrophobic molecules; and They serve to protect the cell. (b) Outer membrane proteins (OMPs): These include the follo wing: Omp C, D, F, and PhoE&LamB are the four major proteins of the outer membrane that are responsible for most of the transmembrane diffusion of maltose and maltodextrins. Tsx, the receptor for T6 bacteriophage, is responsible for the transmembrane diffusion of nucleosides and some amino acids. Omp A protein anchors the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer. It is also the sex pilus receptor in F-mediated bacterial conjugation. The outer membrane also contains proteins that are involved in the transport of specific molecules, such as vitamin B 12 and iron-siderophore complexes; it also contains a limited num-ber of minor proteins, such as enzymes, phospholipases, and proteases. 15 5/14/2012 11:49:44 I Chapter 2 Lipopolysaccharides: Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are complex molecules present in the outer membrane of the Gram-negative bacteria. Structurally, the LPS consist of three main components\u2014lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O polysaccharide or O-antigen (Fig. 2-10). Lipid A: This consists of phosphorylated glucosamine disac-charide units, to which a number of long-chain fatty acids are attached. This also consists of hydroxymyristic acid, a unique fatty acid, which is associated with endotoxic activity of the LPS. There is a little variation in the structure of the lipid A among different species of the Gram-negative bacte-ria. However, it remains the same within the bacteria of the same species. Core oligosaccharide: The core oligosaccharide includes two characteristic sugars\u2014ketodeoxyoctanoic acid (KDO) and a heptose\u2014both joined together by lipid A. This is genus specific and similar in all Gram-negative bacteria. Lipoo-ligosaccharides (LOS) are smaller glycolipids. They have relatively short, multiantennary (i.e., branched) glycans pre sent in bacteria surfaces. They exhibit extensive antigenic and structural diversity even within a single strain. LOS is an important virulence factor. Epitopes on LOS have a termi-nal N-acetyllactosamine (Gal(/H9252)l-4-GlcNAc) residue, which is immunochemically similar to the precursor of the human erythrocyte i antigen. Sialylation of the N-acetyllactosamine residue in vivo provides the organism with the environmen- tal advantages of molecular mimicry of a host antigen and the biologic masking thought to be provided by sialic acids. O polysaccharide or O-antigen: It is the portion extending outwards from the core. It has several peculiar sugars and varies in composition between bacterial strains, conferring species-speci c antigen speci city. It is exposed to host- immune system. Gram-negative bacteria may thwart host defenses by rapidly changing the nature of their O side chains to avoid detection.Differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls are summarized in Table 2-3. Periplasmic space Periplasmic space is a distinct space between cell membrane and outer membrane (innermost layer of Gram-negative cell wall) in Gram-negative bacteria. This space is filled with a loose layer of peptidoglycan matrix. The periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria contains many proteins that participate in nutrient acquisition, and many hydrolytic enzymes, beta-lactamases binding proteins, and enzymes that participate in the peptidoglycan synthesis. Polymers of D-glucose, called membrane-derived oligosaccharides, appear to play a role in osmoregulation. The periplasmic space is less distinct in Gram-positive cell walls. Cell wall of acid-fast bacilli The cell wall of acid-fast bacilli, such as M. tuberculosis, contains large amounts of waxes known as mycolic acids. The cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan and an outer asymmetric lipid bilayer. The inner lipid bilayer contains mycolic acids linked to an arabinoglycan protein and the outer layer contains other extractable lipids. This hydrophobic structure renders these bacteria resistant to many harsh chemicals including deter-gents and strong acids. During staining, if dye is introduced into these cells by brief heating or treatment with detergents, they resist decolorization by sulfuric acid or acid alcohol, and are therefore called acid-fast organisms. Atypical forms of bacteria Atypical forms of bacteria include (i) cell wall deficient forms, (ii) pleomorphic bacteria, and (iii) involution forms. Many agents, such as antibiotics, lysozyme, and bacteriophages inter-fere or inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell wall components, resulting in the formation of defective bacteria.1. Cell wall deficient forms: The cell wall could be removed by hydrolysis with lysozyme or by blocking peptidoglycan synthesis with an antibiotic such as penicillin. These defective bacteria are believed to play a role in the persistence of pyelone-phritis and other chronic infections.

Protoplasts: These are defective unstable forms of bacteria with an intact cytoplasmic membrane but without any cell wall. In hypertonic media, these are produced from Gram-positive cells on treatment with lysozyme. Spheroplasts: These are defective forms derived from Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of EDTA (ethylenediami-netetraacetic acid). The EDTA disrupts the outer membrane allowing access of lysozyme and resulting in formation of spheroplasts. Spheroplasts are osmotically fragile and still retain outer membrane and entrapped peptidoglycan. Mycoplasma: These are naturally occurring bacteria without cell wall. They do not possess any definite shape. They are very minute in size measuring 50-300 nm in diameter. L-forms: This is named after Lister Institute, London, where the abnormal form of Streptobacillus moniliformis was first demonstrated. The L-forms do not exhibit any regular size and shape. They may be spherical or disc shaped, about 0.1- 20 /H9262m in diameter. They are difficult to cultivate and usu- ally require a medium that is solidified with agar as well as having the right osmotic strength. They are produced more readily with exposure to penicillin than with lysozyme. Some bacterial species produce L-forms spontaneously. L-forms in the host may produce chronic infections and are relatively resistant to antibiotic treatment. 2. Pleomorphic bacteria: Pleomorphic bacteria (e.g., Yersinia pestis) may show considerable variation in size and shape called pleomorphism.3. Involution forms : The involution forms are those that on ageing of culture show swollen and aberrant forms, especially in high salt concentration. Demonstration of cell wall The cell walls can be demonstrated by ( a) differential staining procedure, (b) electron microscopy, (c) plasmolysis, (d) micro-dissection, (e) mechanical rupture of the cell, and (f) serological test by exposure to specific antibodies. Cell Membrane Cell membrane or plasma membrane is a thin (5-10 nm) semipermeable membrane that acts as an osmotic barrier. It lies beneath the cell wall separating it from the cell cytoplasm. Cell membrane primarily contains phospholipids and proteins. It also contains enzymes associated with DNA biosynthesis, cell wall polymers, and membrane lipids. Bacterial plasma membranes usually have a higher proportion of protein than eukaryotic membranes. They usually differ from eukaryotic mem branes in lacking sterols, such as cholesterol, except in Mycoplasma. The cell membrane has following functions: It acts as a semipermeable membrane regulating the inflow and outflow of metabolites to and from the protoplasm. It helps in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.Cytoplasm Bacterial cytoplasm is a colloidal suspension of a variety of organic and inorganic solutes in a viscous watery solu-tion. The matrix is largely formed by nearly 70% water. Cytoplasm contains all the biosynthetic components required by a bacterium for growth and cell division, together with genetic material. Prokaryotic cytoplasm, unlike that of eukaryotes, lacks endoplasmic reticulum and mitochon-dria. It also does not show any protoplasmic streaming. Bacteria lack a true cytoskeleton. The cytoplasm ribosomes, mesosomes, and intracytoplasmic packed with ribo- somes. Ribosomes look like small, featureless particles at low magnification in electron micrographs. They are smaller than their eukaryotic counterpart with sedimentation of 70S, com-pared with 80S in eukaryotes. They consist of two subunits of 30S and 50S, giving a net 70S. Ribosomes are important because: They serve as the sites of protein synthesis; matrix ribo-somes synthesize proteins destined to remain within the cell, whereas plasma membrane ribosomes make proteins for transport to the outside. They are also the sites of actions of several antibiotics, such as amino glycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Mesosomes: These are vesicular convoluted or multilaminated structures formed as invagination of the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Mesosomes are of two types\u2014septal and lateral. The septal mesosome attached to the bacterial DNA is believed to coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic divisions dur-ing binary fission. The function of lateral mesosomes still remains to be known. Mesosomes are analogous to the mito-chondria of eukaryotes and are the principal sites of respiratory enzymes in bacteria.Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies: Intracytoplasmic inclu- sion bodies are present in the protoplasm of bacteria. Their main function is believed to be of storage. This occurs when their main constituent element is present in excess in the cul-ture medium. Since inclusion bodies are used for storage, their quantity can vary depending on the nutritional status of the cell. They are the sources of carbon, inorganic substances, and energy. Some inclusion bodies also function to reduce osmotic pressure. They may be of two types: (i) organic inclusion bodies, which usually contain either glycogen or polyhydroxybutyrate, and (ii) inorganic inclusion bodies, which may be of polyphosphate granules or sulfur granules. Examples of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies include metachromatic granules or volutin granules, starch inclusions, and lipid inclusions. Volutin granules, typically present in C. diphtheriae, can be demonstrated by Albert's stain. Similarly, starch granules present in the bacteria can be demonstrated on staining with iodine. Lipid inclusion found in Mycobacteria is demonstrated by Sudan black dye. Chap-02.indd 17 5/14/2012 11:49:44 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 18Section I Chapter 2Nucleus The bacterial nucleus is neither enclosed in a nuclear membrane nor associated with any nucleolus. It is haploid and replicates by simple fission. The nucleus of the bacteria consists of a single circle of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), arranged in a supercoiled circular structure. It measures about 1000 /H9262m when straightened. The chromosome is located in an irregularly shaped region called nucleoid, but often referred to as bacterial chromosome because of the analogy with the eukaryotic structure. The nucleoid is visible through the light microscope after staining with the Feulgen stain, which specifically reacts with DNA. In actively growing bacteria, the bacterial DNA can account for up to 20% of the volume of the bacterium and has projec-tions that extend into the cytoplasmic matrix. Careful electron microscopic studies often have shown the nucleoid to be in contact with either the mesosome or the plasma membrane. Many bacteria also possess smaller circles of extrachromo- somal DNA called plasmids. The plasmids are double-stranded DNA molecules, usually circular, that can exist and replicate independently. Plasmids are not required for host growth and reproduction, although they may carry genes that confer the bacterium with properties such as antibiotics resistance or the capacity to produce toxins or enzymes. Capsule and Slime Layer Many bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, possess a gel-like layer outside the envelope when growing in their natural environments. When a gel-like layer forms a well-defined condensed layer around the bacterial envelope, it is called a capsule and is demonstrable by a light microscope . When this gel-like layer is narrower, detectable only by indirect serological methods or by electron microscope but not by light microscope, it is called a microcapsule. An amorphous viscid colloidal material secreted by some bacteria extracellularly is termed as loose or free slime or glycocalyx. Capsule The capsule is mostly made up of polysaccharides, often referred to collectively as exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides are some-times neutral homopolysaccharides (e.g., the glucans and fruc-tans of many oral streptococci) or negatively charged (Table 2-4). However, Bacillus anthracis has a capsule comprising of polyamino acids, such as D-glutamic acid. The D-glutamic acid is probably analogous to the negatively charged polysaccharide capsule. Key Points The capsule has various functions: It contributes to invasiveness of bacteria by protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. It also prevents bacteria from generating immune response in infected hosts. It facilitates adherence of bacteria to surfaces. Streptococcus mutans, for example, owes its capacity to the glycocalyx to adhere tightly to tooth enamel to its glycocalyx. It plays a role in the formation of biofilms. The glycocalyx layer of the capsule may also play a role in resistance to desiccation. Demonstration of capsule The capsule is fully hydrated and can be demonstrated by light microscopy in either living or stained bacteria as follows:Special capsular staining methods: These include Welch method and M'Faydean capsule stain. Welch method uses copper as mordant. This involves treatment of fixed smear with hot crystal violet solution followed by rinsing with copper sulfate solution. The latter is used to remove excess stain because conventional washing with water would dissolve the capsule. The copper salt also gives color to the background, with the result that the cell and background appear dark blue and the capsule of the bacteria a much paler blue. M'Fadyean capsule stain, using polychrome methylene blue stain, is a frequently used method for demonstration of capsule of B. anthracis.Negative staining with India ink: Also known as wet India ink method. It is the simplest way to demonstrate capsule. It is carried out by mixing a suspension of bacteria with an equal volume of Indian ink on a slide, covering with a cover slip, and then examining it under microscope. The capsule appears as a clear zone around the cell. This method is useful for improving visualization of encapsulated bacteria in clinical samples, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid.Serologic methods: Since capsules are antigenic, they can be demonstrated by serologic methods. Quellung's reaction is Organism Polymer Chemical bacteria Chap-02.indd 18 5/14/2012 11:49:44 AMMORPHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIA 19Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 2such a serological method for demonstration of capsule. When a suspension of bacterium is mixed with its specific anticapsular serum and methylene blue and examined under microscope, the capsule becomes very prominent and appears swollen due to increase in refractoriness. This method is useful for rapid identification of capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, Yersinia, Bacillus, etc. Slime layer Slime layer (S-layer) is a structured paracrystalline protein layer shown by electron microscopy. These are generally composed of a single kind of protein molecule, sometimes with carbohy-drates attached. They are resistant to proteolytic enzymes and protein-denaturing agents. The slime layer protein protects the cell from wall-degrading enzymes and bacteriophages. It plays an important role in the maintenance of cell shape, and it may be involved in cell adhesion to host epidermal surfaces. Surface Appendages The surface appendages of the bacteria include flagella and fimbriae or pili. Flagella Bacterial flagella are thread-like appendages intricately embedded in the cell envelope. These structures are responsible for conferring motility to the bacteria. The arrangement of flagella varies between different bacterial species. Depending on the arrangement, flagella can be of the following types: Monotrichous (single distributed over the entire cell), e.g., Salmonella Typhi, E. coli, etc. Amphitrichous (single fl agellum at both the ends), e.g., (Fig. 2-11). Structure: The flagella are 3-20 /H9262m in length and 0.01-0.03 /H9262 m in diameter. The main part of the filament is made up of protein subunits called flagellin arranged in several helices around a cen-tral hollow core. The flagellum is attached to the bacterial cell body by a complex structure consisting of a hook and a basal body. The basal body bears a set of rings, one pair in Gram-positive bacteria and two pairs in Gram-negative bacteria, through which the bacteria rotates either in a clockwise or an anticlockwise direction. Above the base of filament is the hook, a short curved structure between the external filament and basal body. This part produces a propeller-like repulsion from the revolving f lagellum (Fig. 2-12). Spirochetes are motile bacteria but without any external flagella. They are motile due to the presence of an axial fila-ment. Axial filament consists of a bundle of flagellum-like structures that lie between the cell surface and an outer sheath, and connects one end of the cell to the other. They are some-times called the endoflagellates.Function: Flagella have the following functions: They are primarily responsible for motility of bacteria by chemotaxis. They may play a role in bacterial survival and pathogenesis. They are highly antigenic, they possess H antigens, and some of the immune responses to infection are directed against these proteins. The flagella of different bacteria differ antigenically. Flagellar antibodies are not protective but help in serodiagnosis. Demonstration of flagella: The flagella can be demonstrated by direct and indirect methods. The direct methods include direct demonstration of capsule by electron microscope. These also include demonstration of capsule after staining by special staining methods, such as Ryu's method and Hugh-Leifson's method. Since flagella are very thin structures, these staining methods are used to demonstrate flagella by increasing their thickness by mordanting with tannic acid. Indirect methods of demonstration of fl agella include demonstration of motility of the bacteria by ( a) dark-ground microscopy, (b) hanging drop method, or (c) observing spread-ing type growth on semisolid media, such as mannitol motility medium. Pili (fimbriae) Pili or fimbriae are synonymous for most purposes. They are hair-like filaments that extend from cell surface and are found almost exclusively on Gram-negative bacteria. They are Peritrichous Monotrichous Lophotrichous 5/14/2012 III Chapter Chapter 2composed of structural protein subunits termed pilins. Minor proteins termed adhesins are located at the tips of pili and are responsible for the attachment properties.Structure: The pili are shorter and straighter than flagella, although the basic structure is same. Like flagella, it consists of helics of protein called pilins, arranged around a hollow core but without a motor. They are 0.5 /H9262m long and 10 nm thick. They are antigenic in nature. Pili hemagglutinate RBCs of guinea pigs and are specifically inhibited by mannose, on the basis of which they are classified into four types as follows: Type 1: These occur in E. coli, Klebsiella, Shigella, and Salmonella. They are mannose sensitive. Type 2: These are present in Salmonella Gallinarum and Salmonella Pullorum, devoid of any hemagglutinating or adhesive properties. Type 3: These are present in some strains of Klebsiella, Serratia, etc. They agglutinate RBC only after heating and are man-nose resistant. Type 4: These are mannose resistant and occur in Proteus . Sex pili: A specialized kind of pili called sex pili is responsible for the attachment of donor and recipient cells in bacterial conjugation. These pili are longer (10-20 /H9262m) and vary 1-4 in number. The sex pili are of two types: (i) F pili: They specifically adsorb male specif ic RNA and DNA bacteriophages. They are encoded by sex factor F and fertil-ity inhibition-positive resistance factors (fi /H11001 R factors). (ii) I pili: They adsorb male specific f ilamentous DNA phages, encoded by col factor and fi /H11002 R factor. Function: Pili play a major role in the adherence of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria to host cells, which is a necessary step in initiation of infection. Transfer of bacterial DNA takes place through sex pili during the process of conjugation.Demonstration of pili: The pili can be detected: Directly by electron microscope and By agglutination of RBCs of guinea pigs, fowl, horses, and pigs. They agglutinate human and sheep RBCs weakly. The hemagglutination can be specifically inhibited by D-mannose. Some of the Gram-positive bacteria do not possess typical pili but instead possess a fine fibrillar arrangement of proteins on their surfaces known as fibrils. These fibrils bind to the host surfaces. M-protein of S. pyogenes is an example of Gram-positive bacteria possessing fibrils. Sporulation Sporulation is a primitive process of differentiation with formation of endospores, a highly resistant resting phase of some of the bac-teria (e.g., spores of aerobic Bacillus spp. and anaerobic Clostridium spp.). The organism survives in spores, a dormant state, for longer period of starvation and other adverse conditions. Sporulation process begins in nutrition deprived conditions. It begins with the formation of an axial filament. The process continues with infolding of the membrane so as to produce a double membrane structure whose facing surfaces correspond to the cell wall-synthesizing surface of the cell envelope. The growing points move progressively toward the pole of the cell so as to engulf the developing spore. Two spore membranes then engage in the active synthesis of special layers that form the cell envelope: the spore wall and the cortex, lying outside the facing membranes. In the newly isolated cytoplasm, or core, many vegetative cell enzymes are degraded and are replaced by a set of unique spore constituents. During the process of sporulation, each cell forms a single internal spore; the spore germinates to produce a single vegetative cell (Fig. 2-13). Spores Morphology: The endospores are a highly resistant resting phase of bacteria. The spore shows following structures. 1. Core: The core contains a com plete nucleus (chromosome), all of the components of the protein-synthesizing apparatus, and an energy-generating system based on glycolysis. The heat resistance of spores is due in part to their dehydrated state and in part to the presence of large amounts (5-15% of the spore dry weight) of calcium dipicolinate in the core. 2. Spore wall: This is the innermost lay er surrounding the inner spore membrane. It contains normal peptidoglycan and becomes the cell wall of the germinating vegetative cell. 3. Cortex: It is the thickest la yer of the spore envelope containing unusual peptidoglycan. It is extremely sensitive to lysozyme, and its autolysis plays a role in spore germination. 4. Protein coat: It is composed of a k eratin-like protein con- taining many intramolecular disulfide bonds; this layer confers relative resistance to antibacterial chemical agents due to its impermeability (Fig. 2-14).DNA of bacterial sporulation. Chap-02.indd 20 5/14/2012 11:49:45 AMMORPHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIA 21Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 2 The spores may vary among different species depending on the position, shape, and relative size of the spores. For example, spores may be central, subterminal or terminal; may be oval or spherical in shape; and may be bulging or nonbulging.Demonstration of spores: Spores are most simply observed as intracellular refractile bodies in unstained cell suspensions or as colorless areas in cells stained by conventional methods, such as Gram staining. Spores are commonly stained with malachite green or carbol fuchsin. On staining by modified (using 0.25-0.5% sulfuric acid instead of 20% sulfuric acid), the spores appear as red acid-fast bodies.Properties of spores: Bacterial spores are resistant to ordinary boiling, disinfectants, and heating. Spores of all medically important bacteria are destroyed by autoclaving at 121 /H11034C for 15 minutes. The process of conversion of a spore into vegeta tive cell under suitable conditions is known as germination. The germination process occurs in three stages: activation, initiation, and outgrowth. Key Points The spores have certain uses in clinical microbiology: The spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus are used as indica-tor of proper sterilization by autoclaving. These spores are destroyed at a temperature of 121/H11034C for 10-20 minutes, the time required for autoclaving. The spores of certain bacteria, such as B. anthracis are mis-used as agents of bioterrorism. Growth and Multiplication of Bacteria Bacterial growth can be defined as an orderly increase of all the chemical components of the cell. Cell multiplication is a con-sequence of growth that leads to an increase in the number of bacteria making up a population or culture. Most bacteria divide by binary fission in which the bacteria undergo cell division to produce two daughter cells identical to the parent cell. Bacterial growth can be equated to cell number: one bacterium divides into two, these two produce four, and then eight, and so on (Fig. 2-15). The growth rate of a bacterium is therefore measured by measuring the change in bacterial number per unit time. Generation Time Generation time is the time required for a bacterium to give rise to two daughter cells under optimum conditions. The generation time for most of the pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli, is about 20 minutes. The generation time is longer (i.e., 20 hours) for M. tuberculosis and longest (i.e., 20 days) for M. leprae. A bacterium replicates and multiplies rapidly producing millions of cells within 24 hours. For example, E. coli in about 7 hours can undergo 20 generations and produce 1 million cells, in about 10 hours undergo 30 generations and produce 1 billion cells, and in 24 hours produces 10 21 cells (Fig. 2-16). However, in actual practice, the multiplication of bacteria is arrested after a few cell divisions due to exhaustion of nutrients and accumulation of toxic products. Bacterial Count Microbial concentrations can be measured in terms of (i) cell concentration (the number of viable cells per unit volume of culture) or (ii) biomass concentration (dry weight of cells per unit volume of culture). The number of bacteria at a given time can be estimated by performing a total count or viable count.Total count: This denotes the total number of bacteria in the sample, irrespective of whether they are living or dead. This is done by counting the bacteria under the microscope using counting chamber or by comparing the growth with standard opacity tubes.Viable count: This usually indicates the number of living or viable bacteria. This count can be obtained by dilution or plating method. In dilution method, several tubes with liquid culture media are incubated with varying dilutions of sample and the viable count is calculated from the number of tubes showing bacterial growth. This method is widely used in Protein coatOuter membraneCortexCoreInner membraneSpore wallExosporium FIG. 2-14. 8 FIG. 2-15.

In the plate method , a sample is diluted and small volume of it is spread on the surface of an agar plate. The number of colonies that grow after a suitable incubation time indicates viable count of the bacteria. Bacterial Growth Curve When a broth culture is inoculated with a small bacterial inocu-lum, the population size of the bacteria increases showing a clas-sical pattern. The bacterial growth curve shows the following four distinct phases (Fig. 2-17):1. Lag phase: After a liquid culture broth is inoculated, the multiplication of bacteria does not start immediately. It takes some time to multiply. The time between inoculation and beginning of multiplication is known as lag phase. In this phase, the inoculated bacteria become acclimatized to the environment, switch on various enzymes, and adjust to the environmental temperature and atmospheric conditions. During this phase, there is an increase in size of bacteria but no appreciable increase in number of bacterial cells. The cells are active metabolically. The duration of the lag phase varies with the bacterial species, nature of culture medium, incubation temperature, etc. It may vary from 1 hour to several days.2. Log phase: This phase is characterized by rapid exponential cell growth (i.e., 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 and so on). The bacterial population doubles during every generation. They multiply at their maximum rate. The bacterial cells are small and uniformly stained. The microbes are sensitive to adverse conditions, such as antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.3. Stationary phase: After log phase, the bacterial growth almost stops completely due to lack of essential nutrients, lack of water oxygen, change in pH of the medium, etc. and accumulation of their own toxic metabolic wastes. Death rate of bacteria exceeds the rate of replication of bacteria. Endospores start forming dur-ing this stage. Bacteria become Gram variable and show irregular staining. Many bacteria start producing exotoxins.4. Decline phase: During this phase, the bacterial population declines due to death of cells. The decline phase starts due to (a) accumulation of toxic products and autolytic enzymes and (b) exhaustion of nutrients. Involution forms are common in this stage. Growth rate during different phases of bacterial growth curve is summarized in Table 2-5. The continuous culture is a method of culture useful for industrial and research purpose. This is achieved by using a special device for replenishing nutrients and removing bacte-rial population continuously so that bacteria growth is not inhibited due to lack of nutrients or due to accumulation of toxic bacterial metabolites.

They may be: Obligate aerobes\u2014which can grow only in the presence of oxygen (e.g., P. aeruginosa). Facultative aerobes\u2014which are ordinary aerobes but can also grow without oxygen (e.g., E. coli). Most of the pathogenic bacteria are facultative aerobes. Microaerophilic bacteria\u2014those bacteria that can grow in the presence of low oxygen and in the presence of low (4%) concentration of carbon dioxide (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni). Some fermentative organisms (e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum) are aerotolerant but do not contain the enzyme catalase or superoxide dismutase. Oxygen is not reduced, and therefore hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and nascent oxygen (O2/H11002) are not produced.Anaerobic bacteria: Obligate anaerobes are the bacteria that can grow only in the absence of oxygen (e.g., Clostridium botulinum Clostridium tetani, etc.). These bacteria lack superoxide dismutase and catalase; hence oxygen is lethal to these organisms. Carbon dioxide The organisms that require higher amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) for their growth are called capnophilic bacteria. They grow well in the presence of 5-10% CO2 and 15% O2. In candle jar, 3% CO2 can be achieved. Examples of such bacteria include H. influenzae, Brucella abortus, etc. Temperature The optimum temperature for most of the pathogenic bacteria is 37/H11034C. The optimal temperature, however, is variable; depend-ing on their temperature range, growth of bacteria is grouped as follows: Psychrophiles: These bacteria are cold loving microbes that grow within a temperature range of 0-20/H11034C. Most of soil and water saprophytes belong to this group. Mesophiles: These are moderate temperature loving microbes that grow between 25/H11034C and 40/H11034C. Most of pathogenic bac-teria belong to this group. Thermophiles: These are heat loving microbes. They can grow at a high temperature range of 55-80/H11034C. B. stearothermophilus is an example. pH Most pathogenic bacteria grow between pH 7.2 and 7.6. Very few bacteria, such as lactobacilli, can grow at acidic pH below 4.0. Many food items, such as pickles and cheese, are prevented from spoilage by acids produced during fermentation. V. cholerae is an example of the bacteria that can grow at an alkaline (8.2-8.9) pH. Light Depending on the source of energy bacteria make use of, they may be classified as phototrophs (bacteria deriving energy from sunlight) or chemotrophs (bacteria deriving energy from chem-ical sources). Osmotic pressure Microbes obtain almost all their nutrients in solution from surrounding water. Hence factors such as osmotic pressure and salt concentration of the solution affect the growth of bacteria. Bacteria by virtue of mechanical strength of their cell wall are able to withstand a wide range of external osmotic variations. Organisms requiring high osmotic pressures are called osmo-philic bacteria. Sudden exposure of bacteria to hypertonic solu-tion may cause osmotic withdrawal of water, leading to osmotic shrinkage of the protoplasm ( plasmolysis). On the other hand, sudden transfer of bacteria from concentrated solution to dis-tilled water may cause excessive imbibition of water leading to swelling and bursting of cell ( plasmoptysis). Bacterial Nutrition The minimum requirements for growth of bacteria include water, a source of carbon, a source of nitrogen, and certain inorganic salts. These are required for synthesis of proteins, enzymes, etc. For example, Nitrogen is required for synthesis of proteins, DNA, RNA, and ATP. Sulfur is required for certain amino acids and vitamins, and phosphorous is required for nucleic acids, ATP, and phospholipids. In addition, inorganic ions, such as potassium, sodium, iron, magnesium, calcium, and chloride are required to facilitate enzymatic catalysis and to maintain chemical gradients across the cell membrane. Some bacteria grow in a variety of simple media. E. coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are examples of bacteria that can grow in a variety of simple media contain-ing the inorganic salts and with a source of energy, the simplest being glucose. The inorganic salts in the media provide major essential elements of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phos-phate, and sulfur. These chemicals are usually present in the media and are not added specifically. Some bacteria, such as H. influenzae and other related bacteria, on other hand, are very fastidious and have certain growth requirements. They require certain amino acids, vitamins, and other growth factors that are supplied by adding yeast extract and meat digests to the media. They also require addition of blood or serum for their growth. Certain lower forms of bacteria even fail to grow in cell-free culture media and require living cells for their growth. T. pallidum and M. leprae are two pathogenic bacteria that cannot grow in any artificial culture media, but can only be cultured when inoculated into living animals. Chap-02.indd 23 5/14/2012 11:49:45 AMSterilization and Disinfection 3 Introduction Microbes are ubiquitous and many microorganisms are associated with undesirable consequences, such as food spoil-age and disease. Therefore, it is essential to kill a wide variety of microorganisms or inhibit their growth to minimize their destructive effects. The goal is twofold: (a) to destroy pathogens and prevent their transmission and (b) to reduce or eliminate microorganisms responsible for the contamination of water, food, and other substances. De nition of Frequently Used Terms Sterilization is defined as a process by which an article, sur-face, or medium is freed of all living microorganisms either in the vegetative or in the spore state. Any material that has been subjected to this process is said to be sterile. These terms should be used only in the absolute sense. An object cannot be slightly sterile or almost sterile; it is either sterile or not sterile. Although most sterilization is performed with a physical agent, such as heat, a few chemicals called sterilants can be classified as sterilizing agents because of their ability to destroy spores. A germicide, also called a microbicide, is any chemical agent that kills pathogenic microorganisms. A germicide can be used on inanimate (nonliving) materials or on living tissue, but it ordi narily cannot kill resistant microbial cells. Any physical or chemical agent that kills \"germs\" is said to have germicidal properties. Disinfection refers to the use of a chemical agent that destroys or removes all pathogenic organisms or organisms capable of giving rise to infection. This process destroys vegeta-tive pathogens but not bacterial endospores. It is important to note that disinfectants are normally used only on inanimate objects because they can be toxic to human and other animal tissue, when used in higher concentrations. Disinfection pro-cesses also remove the harmful products of microorganisms (toxins) from materials. Examples of disinfection include (a) applying a solution of 5% bleach to examining table, (b) boil-ing food utensils used by a sick person, and ( c) immersing ther- mometers in an isopropyl alcohol solution between use. In modern usage, sepsis is defined as the growth of micro- organisms in the body or the presence of microbial toxins in blood and other tissues. The term asepsis refers to any practice that prevents the entry of infectious agents into sterile tissues and thus prevents infection.Chemical agents called antiseptics are applied directly to the exposed body surfaces (e.g., skin and mucous membranes), wounds, and surgical incisions to destroy or inhibit vegetative pathogens. Examples of antisepsis include (a) preparing the skin before surgical incisions with iodine compounds, ( b) swabbing an open root canal with hydrogen peroxide, and (c) ordinary hand washing with a germicidal soap. Sanitization is any cleansing technique that mechanically removes microorganisms (along with food debris) to reduce the level of contaminants. A sanitizer is a compound (e.g., soap or detergent) that is used to perform this task. Cooking utensils, dishes, bottles, cans, and used clothing that have been washed and dried may not be completely free of microbes, but they are considered safe for normal use. Air sanitization with ultraviolet lamps reduces airborne microbes in hospital rooms, veterinary clinics, and laboratory installations. It is often necessary to reduce the numbers of microbes on the human skin through degerming procedures. This process usually involves scrubbing the skin or immersing it in chemi-cals, or both. It also emulsifies oils that lie on the outer cutane-ous layer and mechanically removes potential pathogens from the outer layers of the skin. Examples of degerming procedures are (a) surgical hand scrub, ( b) application of alcohol wipes to the skin, and (c) cleansing of a wound with germicidal soap and water. The concepts of antisepsis and degerming procedures clearly overlap, since a degerming procedure can be simultane-ously treated as an antiseptic and vice versa. Sterilization Methods of sterilization can be broadly classified as: 1. Physical methods of sterilization, and 2. Chemical methods of sterilization. Physical Methods of Sterilization Physical methods of sterilization include the following: 1. Sunlight 2. Heat 3. Filtration 4. Radiation 5. Sound (sonic) waves Sunlight Direct sunlight is a natural method of sterilization of water in tanks, rivers, and lakes. Direct sunlight has an active germicidal Chap-03.indd 24 5/14/2012 12:47:25 PMSTERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION 25Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 3effect due to its content of ultraviolet and heat rays. Bacteria present in natural water sources are rapidly destroyed by exposure to sunlight. Heat Heat is the most dependable method of sterilization and is usually the method of choice unless contraindicated. As a rule, higher temperatures (exceeding the maximum) are microbicidal, whereas lower temperatures (below the minimum) tend to have inhibitory or microbistatic effects. Two types of physical heat are used in sterilization\u2014moist and dry heat. Sterilization by moist heat Moist heat occurs in the form of hot water, boiling water, or steam (vaporized water). In practice, the temperature of moist heat usually ranges from 60 to 135\u00b0C. Adjustment of pressure in a closed container can regulate the temperature of steam. Moist heat kills microorganisms by denaturation and coagula-tion of proteins. Sterilization by moist heat can be classified as follows: 1. Sterilization at a temperature /H11021100\u00b0C 2. Sterilization at a temperature of 100\u00b0C 3. Sterilization at a temperature /H11022100\u00b0C 4. Intermittent sterilization 1. Sterilization at a temperature /H11021100\u00b0C: Pasteurization is an exam ple of sterilisation at a temperature /H11021100\u00b0C. Pasteurization: Fresh beverages (such as milk, fruit juices, beer, and wine) are easily contaminated during collection and processing. Because microbes have potential for spoil-ing these foods or causing illness, heat is frequently used to reduce the microbial load and to destroy pathogens. Pasteurization is a technique in which heat is applied to liq-uids to kill potential agents of infection and spoilage, while at the same time retaining the liquid's flavor and food value. This technique is named after Louis Pasteur who devised this method. This method is extensively used for steriliza-tion of milk and other fresh beverages, such as fruit juices, beer, and wine which are easily contaminated during collec-tion and processing. Key Points Two methods of pasteurization are followed: flash method and holder method. In the flash method, milk is exposed to heat at 72\u00b0C for 15-20 seconds followed by a sudden cooling to 13\u00b0C or lower. In the holder method, milk is exposed to a temperature of 63\u00b0C for 30 minutes followed by cooling to 13\u00b0C or lower, but not less than 6\u00b0C. The flash method is preferable for sterilization of milk because it is less likely to change the flavor and nutrient content, and it is more effective against certain resistant pathogens, such as Coxiella and Mycobacterium. Although pasteurization inactivates most viruses and destroys the vegetative stages of 97-99% of bacteria and fungi, it does not kill endospores or thermoduric species (mostly nonpathogenic lactobacilli, micrococci, and yeasts). Milk is not sterile after regular pasteurization. In fact, it can contain 20,000 microbes per milliliter or more, which explains why even an unopened carton of milk will eventually spoil on prolonged storage. Newer techniques have now been used to produce sterile milk that has a stor- age life of 3 months. In this method, milk is processed with ultrahigh temperature (UHT) of 134\u00b0C for 1-2 seconds. 2. Sterilization at a temperature of 100\u00b0C: Sterilsation at a tem perature of 100\u00baC includes ( a) boiling and (b) steam sterilizer at 100\u00b0C.Boiling: Simple boiling of water for 10-30 minutes kills most of the vegetative forms of bacteria but not bacterial spores. Exposing materials to boiling water for 30 minutes kills most nonspore-forming pathogens including resis-tant species, such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylo-cocci. Sterilization by boiling is facilitated by addition of 2% sodium bicarbonate to water. Since boiling only once at 100\u00b0C does not kill all spores, this method cannot be used for sterilization but only for disinfection. Hence, it is not recommended for sterilizing instruments used for surgical procedure. The greatest disadvantage of this method is that the items sterilized by boiling can be easily recontami-nated when removed from water after boiling.Steam sterilizer at 100\u00b0C : Usually, Koch's or Arnold's steam sterilizer is used for heat-labile substances that tend to degrade at higher temperatures and pressure, such as during the process of autoclaving. These substances are exposed to steam at atmospheric pressure for 90 minutes during which most vegetative forms of the bacteria except for the thermophiles are killed by the moist heat. 3. Sterilization at a temperature > 100\u00b0C: This method is otherwise known as sterilization by steam under pressure. A temperature of 100\u00b0C is the highest that steam can reach under normal atmospheric pressure at sea level. This pressure is measured at 15 pounds per square inch ( psi), or 1 atmosphere. In order to raise the temperature of steam above this point, it must be pressurized in a closed chamber. This phenomenon is explained by the physical principle that governs the behavior of gases under pres-sure. When a gas is compressed, its temperature rises in direct relation to the amount of pressure. So, when the pressure is increased to 5 psi above normal atmospheric pressure, the temperature of steam rises to 109\u00b0C. When the pressure is increased to 10 psi above normal, its tem-perature will be 115\u00b0C and at 15 psi (a total of 2 atmo-spheres), it will be 121\u00b0C. It is not the pressure by itself that is killing microbes, but the increased temperature it produces. This forms the principle of sterilization by steam under pressure. Such pressure-temperature combi-nations can be achieved only with a special device that can subject pure steam to pressures greater than 1 atmo-sphere. Health and commercial industries use an autoclave for this purpose and a comparable home appliance is the pressure cooker. Chap-03.indd 25 5/14/2012 12:47:26 PMSection III Chapter I Chapter 3Autoclave: It is a cylindrical metal chamber with an airtight door at one end and racks to hold materials. The lid is fastened by screw clamp and rendered airtight by an asbestos washer. It has a discharge tap for air and steam at the upper side, a pressure gauge and a safety valve that can be set to blow off at any desired pressure. Heating is usually carried out by electricity. Steam circulates within the jacket and is supplied under pressure to the inner chamber where materials are loaded for sterilization (Fig. 3-1). The water in the autoclave boils when its vapor pressure equals that of surrounding atmosphere. Following the increase of pressure inside the closed vessel, the temperature at which the water boils inside the autoclave also increases. The saturated steam that has a higher penetrative power, on coming in contact with a cooler surface condenses to water and releases its latent heat to that surface. For example, nearly 1600 mL steam at 100\u00b0C and at atmospheric pressure condenses into 1 mL of water at 100\u00b0C and releases 518 calories of heat. The gross reduction in volume of steam sucks in more steam to the area and this process continues till the temperature of that surface is elevated to that of the steam. Sterilization is achieved when the steam condenses against the objects in the chamber and gradually raises their temperature. The condensed water facilitates moist conditions that ensures killing of microbes.Sterilization condition: Experience has shown that the most efficient pressure-temperature combination for achiev-ing sterilization by autoclave is 15 psi, which yields 121\u00b0C. It is possible to use higher pressure to reach higher tem-peratures (for instance, increasing the pressure to 30 psi raises the temperature by 11\u00b0C), but doing so will not significantly reduce the exposure time and can harm the items being sterilized. It is important to avoid over packing or haphazardly loading the chamber, because it prevents steam from circulating freely around the contents and impedes the full contact that is necessary. The holding time varies from 10 minutes for light loads to 40 minutes for heavy or bulky ones; the average time being 20 minutes. Key Points Uses of autoclave: The autoclave has many uses, which are given below: It is a good method to sterilize heat-resistant materials, such as glassware, cloth (surgical dressings), rubber (gloves), metallic instruments, liquids, paper, some media, and some heat-resistant plastics. It is also useful for sterilization of heat-sensitive items, such as plastic Petri plates that need to be discarded. It is useful for sterilization of materials that cannot withstand the higher temperature of the hot-air oven. However, the autoclave is ineffective for sterilizing substances that repel moisture (oils, waxes, or powders). Types and uses of various moist heat sterilization methods are summarized in Table 3-1.Sterilization controls: Various sterilization controls are used to determine the efficacy of sterilization by moist heat. These include (a) thermocouples, (b) chemical indicators, and (c) bacteriological spores as mentioned below: (a) Thermocouples are used to record temperatures directly in autoclav es by a potentiometer. (b) Brown's tube is the most commonly used chemical indicator of moist heat sterilization in the autoclav e. It contains red solution that turns green when exposed to temperature of 121\u00b0C for 15 minutes in an autoclave. (c) Bacillus stearothermophilus spores are used as the indicators of moist heat sterilization in the autocla ve. This is a thermophilic bacterium with an optimum temperature of 55-60\u00b0C, and its spores require an exposure of 12 minutes at 121\u00b0C to be destroyed. The efficacy of the autoclave is carried out by placing paper strips impregnated with 10 6 spores in envelopes and keeping those envelopes in different parts of the load inside the autoclave. These strips after sterilization are inoculated into a suitable recovery medium and FIG. 3-1. Autoclave.TABLE 3-1 Types and uses of moist heat sterilization Method Uses Comments Water bath below 100 oCFor sterilization of serum, body fluids, and vaccinesOnly disinfection possible.

Spores are destroyed if the sterilizing condition of the autoclave is proper. 4. Intermittent sterilization: Cert ain heat-labile substances (e.g., serum, sugar, egg, etc.) that cannot withstand the high temperature of the autoclave can be sterilized by a process of intermittent sterilization, known as tyndallization. Tyndallization is carried out over a period of 3 days and req uires a chamber to hold the materials and a reservoir for boiling water. Items to be sterilized are kept in the cham-ber and are exposed to free-fl owing steam at 100\u00b0C for 20 minutes, for each of the three consecutive days. On the rst day, the temperature is adequate to kill all the vegetative forms of the bacteria, yeasts, and molds but not suf cient to kill spores. The surviving spores are allowed to germi-nate to vegetative forms on the second day and are killed on re-exposure to steam. The third day re-ensures killing of all the spores by their germination to vegetative forms. Intermittent sterilization is used most often to sterilize heat-sensitive culture media, such as those cont aining sera (e.g., er's medium), or carbohydrates (e.g., serum sugars) and some canned foods. Sterilization by dry heat Sterilization by dry heat makes use of air with a low mois-ture content that has been heated by a flame or electric heat-ing coil. In practice, the temperature of dry heat ranges from 160\u00b0C to several thousand degrees Celsius. The dry heat kills microorganisms by protein denaturation, oxidative damage, and the toxic effect of increased level of electrolytes. Dry heat is not as versatile or as widely used as moist heat, but it has several important sterilization applications. The temperature and time employed in dry heat vary according to the particular method, but in general they are greater than with moist heat. Sterilization by dry heat includes sterilization by ( a) flaming, (b) incineration , and (c) hot air oven: 1. Flaming: Sterilization of inoculating loop or wire, the tip of for ceps, searing spatulas, etc., is carried out by holding them in the flame of the Bunsen burner till they become red hot. Glass slides, scalpels, and mouths of culture tubes are sterilized by passing them through the Bunsen flame without allowing them to become red hot. 2. Incineration: Incineration is an excellent method f or safely destroying infective materials by burning them to ashes. It has many uses: Incinerators are used to carry out this process and are regularly employed in hospitals and research labs to destroy hospital and laboratory wastes. The method is used for complete destruction and dis-posal of infectious material, such as syringes, needles, culture material, dressings, bandages, bedding, animal carcasses, and pathology samples. This method is fast and effective for most hospital wastes, but not for metals and heat-resistant glass materials. 3. Hot-air oven: The hot-air o ven provides another means of dry heat sterilization and is the most widely used method. The hot-air oven is electrically heated and is fitted with a fan to ensure adequate and even distribution of hot air in the chamber. It is also fitted with a thermostat that ensures circulation of hot air of desired temperature in the chamber. Heated, circulated air transfers its heat to the materials inside the chamber. While sterilizing by hot-air oven, it should be ensured that the oven is not overloaded. The materials should be dry and arranged in a manner which allows free circulation of air inside the chamber. It is essential to fit the test tubes, flasks, etc., with cotton plugs and to wrap Petri dishes and pipettes in a paper. Steriliza-tion by hot-air oven requires exposure to 160-180\u00b0C for 2 hours and 30 minutes, which ensures thorough heating of the objects and destruction of spores (Fig. 3-2). Key Points Hot-air oven is used in laboratories and clinics for heat- resistant items that are not sterilized well by moist heat. They are used for sterilization of: Glasswares (syringes, Petri dishes, forceps, etc.). Chemicals (liquid paraffin, sulfonamide powders, etc.); and Oils that are not penetrated well by steam used in moist heat sterilization. Thermocouples, chemical indicators, and bacteriological spores of Bacillus subtilis are used as sterilization controls to determine the ef cacy of sterilization by hot-air oven. Filtration Filtration is an excellent way to reduce the microbial popula-tion in solutions of heat-labile material by use of a variety of filters. Filters are used to sterilize these heat-labile solutions. FIG. 3-2. Hot-air oven. 28Section I Chapter 3Filters simply remove contaminating microorganisms from solutions rather than directly destroying them. The filters are of two types: (a) depth filters and (b) membrane filters. 1. Depth filters: Depth f ilters consist of fibrous or granular materials that have been bonded into a thick layer filled with twisting channels of small diameter. The solution contain-ing microorganisms is sucked in through this layer under vacuum and microbial cells are removed by physical screen-ing or entrapment and also by adsorption to the surface of the filter material. Depth filters are of the following types: Candle filters: These are made up of (a) diatomaceous earth (e.g., Berkefeld filters) or (b) unglazed porcelain (e.g., Chamberlain filters). They are available in differ-ent grades of porosity and are used widely for purifica-tion of water for drinking and industrial uses. Asbestos filters: These are made up of asbestos such as mag- nesium silicate. Seitz and Sterimat filters are the examples of such filters. These are disposable and single-use discs available in different grades. They have high adsorbing capacity and tend to alkalinize the filtered fluid. Their use is limited by the carcinogenic potential of asbestos. Sintered glass filters: These are made up of finely pow- dered glass particles, which are fused together. They have low absorbing property and are available in different pore sizes. These filters, although can be cleaned easily, are brittle and expensive. 2. Membrane filters: Membrane filters are made up of ( a) cellulose acetate, (b ) cellulose nitrate, (d ) polyvinylidene fluoride, or (e ) other synthetic materials. These filters are now widely used and have replaced depth filters for last many years. These filters are circular porous membranes and are usually 0.1 mm thick. Although a wide variety of pore sizes (0.015-12 /H9262m) are available, mem- branes with pores about 0.2 /H9262 m are used, because the pore size is smaller than the size of bacteria. These filters are used to remove most vegetative cells, but not viruses, from solutions to be filtered. In the process of filtration, the membranes are held in special holders and often preceded by depth filters made of glass fibers to remove larger parti-cles that might clog the membrane filter. The solution is then pushed or forced through the filter with a vacuum or with pressure from a syringe, peristaltic pump, or nitrogen gas bottle, and collected in previously sterilized containers. Air also can be sterilized by filtration. Two common exam-ples are surgical masks and cotton plugs on culture vessels that let air in but keep microorganisms out. Laminar flow biological safety cabinets are most widely used air filtration systems in hospitals and industries. In this method, air is passed through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that remove nearly 99.97% of 0.3 /H9262m particles from the filtered air. Radiations The ionizing and nonionizing radiations are the two types of radiation used for sterilization (Table 3-2). 1. Ionizing radiations: Ionizing radiation is an excellent sterilizing agent with ver y high penetrating power. These radiations penetrate deep into objects and destroy bacterial endospores and vegetative cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. These are, however, not that effective against viruses. Ionizing radiations include (a) X-rays, (b) gamma rays, and (c) cosmic rays. Gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source is used for sterilization of antibiotics, hormones, sutures, catheters, animal feeds, metal foils, and plastic disposables, such as syringes. This has also been used to sterilize and \"pasteurize\" meat and other food items. Irradiation usually kills Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, and other patho- gens. Since there is no detectable increase of temperature in this method, this method is commonly referred to as \"cold sterilization.\" Both the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization have approved food irradiation and declared it safe. Key Points Gamma radiation from a cobalt-60 source is used for steriliza-tion of antibiotics, hormones, sutures, catheters, animal feeds, metal foils, and plastic disposables such as syringes. This has also been used to sterilize and 'pasteurize' meat and other food items.Key Points Membrane filters remove microorganisms by screening them out in the way a sieve separates large sand particles from small ones. These filters have many uses: They are used to sterilize pharmaceutical substances, oph-thalmic solutions, liquid culture media, oils, antibiotics, and other heat-sensitive solutions. They are used to obtain bacterial free filtrates of clinical specimens for virus isolation. They are used to separate toxins and bacteriophages from bacteria.Types Uses Comments Ionizing radiation administered using Cobalt-60-based instrumentsFor sterilization of pharmaceuticals like antibiotics, hormones, sutures; and prepacked disposable items, such as syringes, infusion sets, catheters, etc.Though expensive and fraught with safety risks, it is very effective due to better penetration power Nonionizing radiation administered through UV lampsOnly for disinfection of clear surfaces in OTs, laminar flow hoods, etc.Hazardous and not as effective as ionizing radiation TABLE 3-2 Types and uses of radiation for sterilization Chap-03.indd 28 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMSTERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION 29Section III Chapter Section I Chapter 3 2. Nonionizing radiations: Nonionizing radiations include infrared and ultra violet radiations. Infrared radiations are used for rapid and mass steriliza-tion of disposable syringes and catheters. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation with wavelength of 240-280 nm is quite lethal and has a marked bactericidal activity. It acts by denaturation of bacterial protein and also inter-feres with replication of bacterial DNA. UV radiation is used primarily for disinfection of closed areas in microbiology laboratory, inoculation hoods, laminar flow, and operating theaters. It kills most vegetative bacteria but not spores, which are highly resistant to these radiations. However, it does not penetrate glass, dirt films, water, and other sub-stances very effectively. Since UV radiations on prolonged exposure tend to burn the skin and cause damage to the eyes, UV lamps should be switched off while people are working in such areas. Sound (sonic) waves High-frequency sound (sonic) waves beyond the sensitivity of the human ear are known to disrupt cells. Sonication transmits vibra-tions through a water-filled chamber (sonicator) to induce pres-sure changes and create intense points of turbulence that can stress and burst cells in the vicinity. Sonication also forcefully dislodges foreign matter from objects. Heat generated by the sonic waves (up to 80\u00b0C) also appears to contribute to the antimicrobial action. Gram-negative rods are most sensitive to ultrasonic vibra- tions, while Gram-positive cocci, fungal spores, and bacterial spores are resistant to them. Ultrasonic devices are used in dental and some medical offices to clear debris and saliva from instruments before sterilization and to clean dental restorations. However, most sonic machines are not reliable for regular use in disinfection or sterilization. Biological controls used for testing the efficacy of steriliza- tion techniques are summarized in Table 3-3. Chemical Methods of Sterilization Several chemical agents are used as antiseptics as well as dis-infectants. All these chemical agents (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, etc.) are described later in detail under disinfection. The effects of cold and desiccation: The main benefit of cold treatment is to slow the growth of cultures and microbes in food during processing and storage. It is essential to know that cold merely retards the activities of most microbes. Although it is true that cold temperatures kill some microbes, gradual cool-ing, long-term refrigeration, or deep-freezing does not adversely affect most of the microorganisms. In fact, freezing tempera-tures, ranging from /H11002 70 to /H11002 135\u00b0C, provide an environment that can preserve cultures of bacteria, viruses, and fungi for lon-ger periods. Some psychrophiles grow very slowly even at freez-ing temperatures and can continue to secrete toxic products. S. aureus, Clostridium species (spore formers), Strepto coccus species, and several types of yeasts, molds, and viruses are the pathogens that can survive for several months in the refrigerated food items. Key Points Lyophilization is a process of freezing and drying. It is the most common method of preserving microorganisms and other cells in a viable state for many years. Pure cultures are frozen instantaneously and exposed to a vacuum that rap-idly removes the water (it goes right from the frozen state into the vapor state). This method avoids the formation of ice crystals that would damage the cells. Although not all cells survive this process, lot many of them survive after reconstitution of lyophilized culture. As a general rule, chilling, freezing, and desiccation are not considered as methods of disinfection or sterilization because their antimicrobial effects are erratic and uncertain, and one cannot be sure that pathogens subjected to these procedures have been killed. Disinfection Disinfection is the process of inactivating microorganisms by direct exposure to chemical or physical agents. Differences between sterilization and disinfection have been summarized in Table 3-4. Disinfectants are products or biocides that destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on inanimate objects or surfaces. Disinfectants can be sporistatic but are not nec-essarily sporicidal. Antiseptics are biocides or products that destroy or inhibit the growth of microorganisms in or on living tissue. Antiseptics and disinfectants are used extensively in hospitals for a variety of topical and hard surface applications. They are an essential part of infection control practices and aid in the prevention of nosocomial infections. Properties of Ideal Disinfectant An ideal disinfectant or antiseptic has the following characteristics: 1. Ideally, the disinfectant should have a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It must be ef fective against a wide variety of infectious agents (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, bacterial endospores, fungi, and at high dilutions.Technique Control organism Autoclave stearothermophilus Hot-air oven oxide Bacillus globigiiBacillus subtilisTABLE 3-3Biological controls used for testing efficacy of sterilization techniques Chap-03.indd 29 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 30Section I Chapter 3 2. It should act in the presence of organic matter. 3. It should not be toxic to human or corrosive. In prac-tice, this balance betw een effectiveness and low toxicity for animals is hard to achieve. Some chemicals are used despite their low effectiveness, because they are relatively nontoxic. 4. It should be stable upon storage and should not undergo any chemical change. 5. It should be odorless or with a pleasant odor . 6. It should be soluble in water and lipids for penetration into microorganisms. 7. It should be effective in acidic as well as in alkaline media. 8. It should have speedy action. 9. If possible, it should be relatively inexpensive. Action of Disinfectants Disinfectants act in many ways as discussed below. 1. They produce damage to the cell wall and alter permeabil-ity of the cell membrane, resulting in exposure, damage, or loss of the cellular contents. 2. They alter proteins and form protein salts or cause coagu-lation of proteins. 3. They inhibit enzyme action and inhibit nucleic acid syn-thesis or alter nucleic acid molecules. 4. They cause o xidation or hydrolysis. Factors Infl uencing Activity of Disinfectants Various conditions influencing the efficiency of disinfectant are as follows: Temperature: Increase in temperature increases the efficiency of disinfectants. Type of microorganism: Vegetative cells are more suscep- tible than spores. Spores may be resistant to the action of disinfectants. Physiological state of the cell: Young and metabolically active cells are more sensitive than old dormant cells. Nongrowing cells may not be affected. Environment: The physical or chemical properties of the medium or substance influence rate as well as efficiency of disinfectants, e.g., pH of the medium and presence of extraneous materials. Types of Disinfectants Disinfectants include the following: (a) phenolic compounds, (b) halogens, (c) alcohols, (d) aldehydes, (e) gases, (f) surface active agents, (g) oxidizing agents, (h) dyes, (i) heavy metals, and (j) acids and alkalis. Phenolic compounds In 1867, Joseph Lister employed phenolic compounds to reduce the risk of infection during operations. Phenolic compounds are the most widely used antiseptics and disinfectants in laboratories and hospitals worldwide. They are bactericidal or bacteriostatic and some are fungicidal also. They act by denaturing proteins and disrupting cell membranes. They are effective in the pres-ence of organic material and remain active on surfaces long after application. Different phenolic compounds are as follows: Phenol: It is effective against vegetative forms of bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and certain fungi. It is an excellent disinfectant for feces, blood, pus, sputum, etc. It has a low degree of activity as compared to other derivatives. It is not suitable for application to skin or mucous membrane. Cresol: Cresols are more germicidal and less poisonous than phenol but corrosive to living tissues. They are used for cleaning floors (1% solution), for disinfection of surgical instruments, and for disinfection of contaminated objects. Lysol is a solution of cresols in soap. Halogenated diphenyl compounds: These compounds include hexachlorophene and chlorhexidine. They are highly effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are used as skin antiseptics and for the clean-ing of wound surfaces. Hexachlorophene has been one of the most popular antiseptics because once applied it persists on the skin and reduces growth of skin bacteria for longer periods. However, it can cause brain damage and is now used in hospital nurseries only after a staphylococcal outbreak. Halogens Halogens are fluorine, bromine, chlorine, and iodine\u2014a group of nonmetallic elements that commonly occur in minerals, sea water, and salts. Although they can occur either in the ionic (halide) or nonionic state, most halogens exert their antimicro-bial activity primarily in their nonionic state, but not in the halide state (e.g., chloride, iodide). Sterilization Disinfection Definition Freeing an article, surface, or medium from all living organisms including viruses, bacteria and their spores, and fungi and their spores.Process that reduces the number of contaminating microorganisms, liable to cause infection to a level which is deemed no longer harmful to health. Spores are not killed. Uses Objects or instruments coming in direct contact with a break in skin or mucous membrane or entering a sterile body area.Objects or instruments coming in direct contact with mucous membrane but tissue is intact or via intact skin. Examples Surgical instruments, needles, syringes, parenteral fluid, arthroscopes, media, reagents and aspirators, gastroscopes, bed pans, urinals, etc. TABLE 3-4 between sterilization and disinfection Chap-03.indd 30 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMSTERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION 31Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 3These agents are highly effective disinfectants and anti- septics, because they are microbicidal and not just microbi-static. They are also sporicidal with longer exposure. For these reasons, halogens are the active ingredients in nearly one-third of all antimicrobial chemicals currently marketed. Chlorine and iodine are the only two routinely used halogens because fl uorine and bromine are dangerous to handle. Chlorine and its compounds: Chlorine has been used for dis-infection and antisepsis for approximately 200 years. The major forms used in microbial control are (a ) liquid and gaseous chlo- rine and (b ) hypochlorites. In solution, these compounds com- bine with water and release hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which oxidizes the sulfhydryl (S-H) group on the amino acid cysteine and interferes with disulfide (S-S) bridges on numerous enzymes. The resulting denaturation of the enzymes is permanent. Gaseous and liquid chlorine are used almost exclusively for large-scale disinfection of drinking water, sewage, and wastewa-ter from sources, such as agriculture and industry. Chlorine kills not only bacterial cells and endospores but also fungi and viruses. Treatment of water with chlorine destroys many patho-genic vegetative microorganisms without unduly affecting its taste. Chlorination at a concentration of 0.6-1.0 part of chlorine per million parts of water makes water potable and safe to use. Key Points Hypochlorites are perhaps the most extensively used of all chlorine compounds. They are used for: Sanitization and disinfection of food equipment in dairies, restaurants, and canneries; Treatment of swimming pools, spas, drinking water, and even fresh foods; Treatment of wounds; and Disinfection of equipments, beddings, and instruments. Common household bleach is a weak solution (5%) of sodium hypochlorite that is used as an all-around disinfectant, deodor-izer, and stain remover. It is frequently used as an alternative to pure chlorine in treating water supplies. However, the major limitations of chlorine compounds are that they are: (a) Ineffective if used at an alkaline pH, (b) Less effective in the presence of excess organic matter, and (c) Relatively unstable, especially if exposed to light. Iodine and its compounds: Iodine is a pungent black chemical that forms bro wn-colored solutions when dissolved in water or alcohol. Iodine rapidly penetrates the cells of microorganisms, where it apparently disturbs a variety of metabolic functions. It acts by interfering with the hydrogen and disulfide bonds of proteins (similar to chlorine). It kills all types of microorgan-isms if optimum concentrations and exposure times are used. Iodine activity, unlike chlorine, is not as adversely affected by organic matter and pH. The two primary iodine preparations are free iodine in solution and iodophors. Free iodine in solution: Aqueous iodine contains 2% free iodine in solution and 2.4% sodium iodide. It is used as a topical antiseptic before surgery and also occasionally as a treatment for burnt and infected skin. A stronger iodine solution (5% iodine and 10% potassium iodide) is used primarily as a disinfectant for plas-tic items, rubber instruments, cutting blades, and thermometers. Iodine tincture is a 2% solution of iodine and sodium iodide in 70% alcohol that can be used in skin antisepsis. Because iodine can be extremely irritating to the skin and toxic when absorbed, strong aqueous solutions and tinctures (5-7%) are no longer considered safe for routine antisepsis. Iodine tablets are available for disinfecting water during emer- gencies or for destroying pathogens in impure water supplies. Iodophors: Iodophors are complexes of iodine and a neutral polymer, such as polyvinyl alcohol. This formulation permits the slow release of free iodine and increases its degree of pen-etration. These compounds have largely replaced free iodine solutions in medical antisepsis because they are less prone to staining or irritating tissues. Betadine, povidone, and isodine are the common iodophor compounds that contain 2-10% of available iodine. They are used to prepare skin and mucous membranes for surgery and in surgical hand scrubs. They are also used to treat burns and to disinfect equipments. A recent study has shown that betadine solution is an effective means of preventing eye infections in newborn infants, and it may replace antibiotics and silver nitrate as the method of choice. Alcohols Alcohols are among the most widely used disinfectants and antiseptics. They are bactericidal and fungicidal but not spori-cidal. They have no action against spores and viruses. Ethyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol are the two most popular alcohol germicides. They are effective at a concentration of 60-70% in water. They act by denaturing bacterial proteins and possibly by dissolving membrane lipids. They are used as skin antisep-tics. Isopropyl alcohol is used for disinfection of clinical ther-mometers. A 10-15 minute soaking is sufficient to disinfect thermometers. Methyl alcohol is effective against fungal spores. Aldehydes Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are the two most commonly used aldehydes that are used as disinfectants. They are highly reactive molecules that combine with nucleic and alkylating molecules. They are sporicidal and can also be used as chemical sterilants.Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is usually dissolved in water or alcohol before use. In aqueous solution, it is bactericidal, spo-ricidal, and also effective against viruses. Formalin solution is 40% aldehyde in aqueous solution. It is used to: Preserve fresh tissue specimens, Destroy anthrax spores in hair and wool, Prepare toxoids from toxins, Sterilize bacterial vaccines, and Kill bacterial cultures and suspensions. Chap-03.indd 31 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMSection III A 2% buffered solution of glutaraldehyde is an effective disinfectant. It is less irritating than formaldehyde and is used to disinfect hospital and laboratory equipments. Glutaraldehyde usually disinfects objects within time frame of 10 minutes but may require as long as 12 hours to destroy all spores. Glutaraldehyde is especially effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses. It can be used for cleaning cysto-scopes and bronchoscopes, corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, metal instruments, and polythene tubing. Gases Various gaseous agents are used for sterilization of large volume of heat-sensitive disposable items and also instruments. Ethylene oxide, formaldehyde gas, and betapropiolactone are frequently used gaseous agents.Ethylene oxide: Ethylene oxide is a colorless liquid used for gaseous sterilization. It is active against all kinds of bacteria, spores, and viruses. It kills all types of microorganisms by inhibiting proteins and nucleic acids. It is both microbicidal and sporicidal. It is a highly effective sterilizing agent because it rapidly penetrates packing materials, including plastic wraps. It is used to sterilize disposable plastic Petri dishes, sutures, syringes, heart-lung machine, respirators, and dental equip-ments. Ethylene oxide is highly inflammable and carcinogenic. Extensive aeration of the sterilized materials is necessary to remove residual ethylene oxide gas, which is toxic.Formaldehyde gas: The formaldehyde gas is used for (a) the fumigation of operation theaters, wards, sick rooms, and laboratories; and (b) the sterilization of instruments and heat-sensitive catheters, clothing and bedding, furniture, books, etc. The formaldehyde gas is produced by adding 150 gm of potassium permanganate to 280 mL formalin in 1000 cu ft of room volume. The room to be sterilized is completely closed and sealed at least for 48 hours after fumigation with formalin gas. Sterilization is achieved by condensation of gas on exposed surface. The gas is toxic when inhaled and is irri-tant to eye, hence its effect should be nullified by exposure to ammonia. It is highly inflammable and carcinogenic.Beta-propiolactone: Beta-propiolactone (BPL) is a condensa- tion product of ketone and formaldehyde. It is active against all microorganisms and viruses. It is more efficient than formaldehyde for fumigation purpose. In the liquid form, it has been used to sterilize vaccines and sera. BPL destroys microorganisms more readily than ethylene oxide but does not penetrate materials well and may be carcinogenic. For these reasons, BPL has not been used as extensively as ethylene oxide. Recently, vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide has been used to decontaminate biological wastes. Surface active agents Surface active agents, such as detergents are the substances that alter energy relationship at interfaces producing a reduction in surface tension. Detergents are organic mol-ecules that serve as wetting agents and emulsifiers because they have both polar hydrophilic and nonpolar hydrophobic ends. Due to their amphipathic nature, detergents solubilize and are very effective cleansing agents. They are different from soaps, which are derived from fats. Surface active agents are of four types: 1. Cationic surface active agents: The cationic detergents are disinfectants. Cationic detergents like benzal-konium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride kill most bacteria but not M. tuberculosis, endospores, or viruses. They do have the advantages of being stable and nontoxic, but they are inactivated by hard water and soap. These are often used as skin antiseptics and also as disinfectants for disinfection of food utensils and small instruments. Qua-ternary ammonium compounds, such as cetrimide are the most popular cationic detergents. They act by disrupting microbial membranes and possibly by denaturing proteins. 2. Anionic surface active agents: These include soaps prepared either from saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, which act better at acidic pH. The soaps prepared from saturated fatty acids are more effective against Gram-negative organisms, whereas those prepared from unsaturated fatty acids are more active against Gram-positive bacilli and Neisseria. 3. Nonionic surface active agents: These are nontoxic and some of them ma y even promote the growth of bacteria. 4. Amphoteric or ampholytic compounds: These are active against a wide range of Gram-positiv e and Gram-negative bacteria and also against a few viruses. These are known as \"Tego\" compounds. Oxidizing agents This group includes halogens, hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, and sodium perborate. They are good disinfec-tants and antiseptics but are less effective in the presence of organic matter. Hydrogen peroxide, used as 3% solution, is a weak disinfectant. It is useful for cleaning of the wounds and for mouth wash or gargle. Potassium permanganate is bacteri-cidal in nature and active against viruses also. Dyes The dyes that have been used extensively as skin and wound antiseptics include (a ) activity against Gram-positive bac-teria than against Gram-negative organisms. They act by interfer-ing with the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins in bacterial cells. The yellow acridine dyes, acriflavine and proflavine, are sometimes used for antisepsis and wound treatment in medi-cal and veterinary clinics. Aniline dyes (such as gentian violent, crystal violet, and malachite green) are also more active against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative organisms. They are also effective against various fungi, hence are incorpo-rated into solutions and ointments to treat fungal skin infec-tions, such as ringworm. The dyes, nevertheless, have limited applications because they stain and have a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activ-ity. They also have no activity against tubercle bacilli. Their actions are also inhibited by the presence of organic matter. Chap-03.indd 32 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMSTERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION 33Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 3 Heavy metals Soluble salts of mercury, silver, copper, arsenic, and other heavy metals have antibacterial activity, both bactericidal and bacte-riostatic. They combine with proteins, often with their sulfhy-dryl groups and inactivate them. They may also precipitate cell proteins. Silver compounds are widely used as antiseptics. Silver sulfadiazine is used for burns. Silver nitrate is used as a prophylactic agent in ophthalmia neonatorum in newborn infants. Copper sulfate is an effective algicide in lakes and swimming pools. Mercuric chloride is used as disinfectant. These compounds, however, are increasingly replaced by other less toxic and more effective germicides. Acids and alkalis Acids (such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and benzoic acid) and alkalis (like potassium and sodium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide) are germi-cidal in nature. They kill microorganisms by hydrolysis and altering the pH of the medium. They are rarely used as disinfectants. Organic acids are widely used in food preservation because they prevent spore germination and bacterial and fungal growth, and because they are generally regarded as safe to eat. Acetic acid, in the form of vinegar, is a pickling agent that inhibits bacterial growth. Propionic acid is com-monly added into breads and cakes to retard molds; lactic acid is added to sauerkraut and olives to prevent growth of anaerobic bacteria, especially the clostridia; and benzoic and sorbic acids are added to beverages, syrups, and margarine to inhibit yeasts. Activities of commonly used disinfectants against various microorganisms are summarized in Table 3-5. Testing of Disinfectants The efficiency of disinfectants can be determined with the help of several tests. These are: Phenol coefficient (Rideal-Walker) test Chick Phenol designed the phenol coefficient test to compare the performance of a disinfectant with that of phe-nol for the ability to kill Salmonella typhi. Phenol coefficient is determined by dilution of the disinfectant in question which sterilizes the suspension of S. typhi in a given time divided by the dilution of phenol which sterilizes the suspension in the same time. In this test, a series of dilutions of phenol and the experi- mental disinfectant are inoculated with the test bacteria S. typhi and S. aureus, then placed in a 20\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C water bath. These inoculated disinfectant tubes are then subcultured on a regular fresh medium at 5 minute intervals, and the subcul-tures are incubated for two or more days. The highest dilutions that kill the bacteria after a 10 minute exposure, but not after 5 minutes, are used to calculate the phenol coefficient. The reciprocal of the appropriate test disinfectant dilution is divided by that for phenol to obtain the coefficient. Suppose that the phenol dilution was 1/90 and maximum effective dilu-tion for disinfectant X tested was 1/450, then the phenol coef-ficient of X would be 5. Key Points The higher the phenol coef cient value, the more effective the disinfectant under these test conditions. A value greater than 1 means that the disinfectant is more effective than the phenol.The test, however, does not show the action of disinfect-ant in natural conditions, i.e., in the presence of organic contaminants. Chick Martin test It is a modification of Rideal-Walker test, in which the disinfectant acts in the presence of organic contaminants (e.g., dried yeast, feces, etc.) to simulate the natural conditions. Capacity (Kelsey-Sykes) test The capacity (Kelsey-Sykes) test determines the appropriate use of dilutions of the disinfectants. It measures the capacity of a disin-fectant to retain its activity when repeatedly used microbiologi-cally. The disinfectant is assessed by its ability to kill bacteria by demonstrating growth or no growth on recovery culture media but not by comparison with phenol. The test is performed under both clean and dirty conditions, hence shows the effectiveness of a disinfectant in the presence of organic material. In-use (Kelsey-Maurer) test The \"in-use\" (Kelsey-Maurer) test is a test that determines whether the chosen disinfectant is effective, in actual use, in hospital practice and also for the period of its use. The effectiveness of the disinfectant is determined by its ability to inactivate a known number of standard strain of a pathogenic staphylococci on a given surface within a certain given time. In-use test allows a more accurate determination of effective-ness of a disinfectant compared to phenol coefficient test.Disinfectant Fungi Bacteria Spores Enveloped virusesNonenveloped viruses Phenol Good Good Nil Good Variable Hypochlorite Good Good Fair Good Good Alcohols Good Good Nil Good Variable Aldehydes Good Good Good Good Good Glutaraldehyde Good Good Good Good Good Iodophor Good Good Nil Good GoodTABLE 3-5 Activities of commonly used disinfectants Chap-03.indd 33 5/14/2012 12:47:27 PMCulture Media4 Introduction Laboratory diagnosis of an infection is usually confirmed by isolating and culturing microorganisms in artificial media. Bacteria and fungi are cultured in either liquid (broth) or on solid (agar) artificial media. Koch pioneered the use of agar as a base for culture media. He developed the pour plate method and was the first to use solid culture media for culture of bacteria. At first, Koch cultured bacteria on the sterile surfaces of cut, boiled potatoes. This was unsatisfactory, because bacteria would not always grow well on potatoes. He then tried to solidify regular liquid media by adding gelatin. Separate bacterial colonies developed after the surface had been streaked with a bacterial sample. The sample could also be mixed with liquefied gelatin medium. When the gelatin medium hardened, individual bacteria produced separate colonies. Despite its advantages, gelatin was not an ideal solidifying agent because it was digested by many bacteria and melted when the temperature rose above 28\u00b0C. A better alternative was provided by Fannie Eilshemius Hesse, the wife of Walther Hesse, one of Koch's assistants. She suggested the use of agar as a solidifying agent\u2014she had been using it successfully to make jellies for sometime. Agar was not attacked by most bacteria and did not melt until it reaches a temperature of 100\u00b0C. One of Koch's assistants, Richard Petri, developed the Petri dish (plate), a container for solid culture media. Ingredients of Culture Media The basic constituents of culture media include the following: Agar Agar or Agar Agar is the main component that is used universally for prepa-ration of solid media. It is obtained from a variety of sea weeds and after necessary processing is usually available as powder or as long shreds. Agar is chiefly composed of: A long-chain polysaccharide, consisting of D-galactopyranose units; A variety of inorganic quantities of protein-like materials, traces of long-chain fatty acids; and Minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. Agar is usually used in a concentration of 2-3%. Agar is hydro-lyzed at high temperatures and at high acid or alkaline pH.Key Points Agar has a unique property of melting at 98\u00b0C and solidifying at 42\u00b0C. The jellifying property of agar varies depending on the type of agar used (e.g., New Zealand agar is more jellifying than Japanese agar). Agar does not have any nutritive value and is also not affected by growth of bacteria. Peptone Peptone is another important ingredient of culture media. It is a complex mixture of partially digested proteins. It is obtained by digestion of lean meat or other protein materials (such as heart muscle, casein, fibrin, or soya flour) with proteolytic enzymes (such as pepsin, trypsin, or papain). Key Points Peptone is an important source of nutrition for bacteria to grow. It contains peptones, proteoses, amino acids, inorganic salts (phosphates, potassium, and magnesium), accessory nicotinic acid and riboflavin. Neopeptone and proteose peptone are special types of peptone with high nutritive value. Other Ingredients Other common ingredients of media include water, sodium chloride and other electrolytes, meat extract, yeast extract, malt extract, blood, and serum. Meat extract is available commercially as Lab-Lemco and contains inorganic salts, carbohydrates, certain growth factors, and protein degradation products. Blood or serum is usually used for enriching culture of bacteria. Usually, 5-10% defibrinated sheep or human blood is used. Types of Culture Media Culture media can be classified in several ways: Liquid Media, Semisolid Media, and Solid Media Liquid media Liquid media provide greater sensitivity for the isolation of small numbers of microorganisms. Examples of liquid media Chap-04.indd 34 5/14/2012 11:48:51 AMCULTURE MEDIA 35Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 4include nutrient broth, sugar media, and enrichment media. Composition and uses of some common liquid media are summarized in Table 4-1. Liquid media have the following disadvantages: Identification of mixed cultures growing in liquid media requires subculture onto solid media so that isolated colo-nies can be processed separately for identification. Growth in liquid media also cannot ordinarily be quantitated. Bacteria grown in liquid cultures often form colloidal suspensions. Solid media Agar is used as a solidifying agent in most culture media. By varying the concentration of agar, it is possible to make the medium solid or semisolid. Solid media, though somewhat less sensitive than liquid media, provide isolated colonies that can be quantified and identified. Some genera and species can be recognized on the basis of their colony morphologies. Nutrient agar (Fig. 4-1) prepared by adding 2% agar to nutrient broth is the simplest and most common medium used routinely in diagnostic laboratories. Other examples of solid media include blood agar, chocolate agar, MacConkey agar, etc. Composition and uses of some common solid media are summarized in Table 4-2. Semisolid media Addition of reduced concentration of agar (0.2-0.4%) makes the medium semisolid, which facilitates spread of the bacteria in the medium. Simple, Complex, De ned, and Special Media Simple, complex, defined, and special media are different types of media used for culture of the bacteria.

Nutrient broth is an example of a simple liquid medium that consists of peptone, meat extract, sodium chloride, and water. Addition of 0.5% glucose to nutrient broth makes it glucose broth. Nutrient agar is an example of a simple solid medium. The medium is used routinely for isolation of many bacteria from clinical specimens. Complex media Most of the media other than basal media are usually known as complex media [e.g., chocolate MacConkey etc.]. Complex media have some complex ingredi-ents, which consist of a mixture of many chemicals in unknown proportions. This is an undefined medium, because the amino acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition unknown. The complex media contain: Water, A carbon source such as glucose for bacterial growth, Various salts needed for bacterial growth, and A source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef and yeast extract). De ned media A defined medium, also known as synthetic medium, contains known quantities of all ingredients. All the chemicals used are known, and it does not contain any animal, yeast, or plant tissue. These media consist of: Trace elements and vitamins; A defined carbon source and nitrogen source required by certain microbes. Glucose or glycerol is often used as carbon sources and ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitro-gen sources. Dubos' medium with Tween 80 is an example of this medium. Special media These include (a) enriched media, (b) enrichment media, (c) selective media, (d) indicator or differential media, (e) trans-port media, and ( f ) sugar media. Enriched media: The enriched media are invariably solid media that facilitate growth of certain fastidious bacteria. These media are prepared by adding substances like blood, serum, and egg to the basal media in order to meet the nutritional requirements of more exacting and more fastidious bacteria. Blood agar (Color Photo 1), chocolate agar, Loeffler's serum slope (LSS), and LJ medium are some examples of enriched media. Blood agar is an enriched medium in which nutritionally rich whole blood supplements constitute the basic nutrients. Chocolate agar is enriched with heat-treated blood (80\u00b0C), which turns brown and gives the medium the color for which it is named.Enrichment media: Enrichment media are liquid media that stimulate the growth of certain bacteria or suppress the growth of others for isolation of desired pathogenic bacteria. Commensal bacteria, such as Escherichia coli present in feces, tend to overgrow pathogenic ones in stool specimen. In such situations, enrichment media (such as selenite-F broth or tetrathionate broth) are used for the isola tion of Salmonella Typhi and Shigella spp. from feces. Key Points Enrichment media are useful for isolation of wanted bacteria from stool and other specimens containing more than one spe-cies of bacteria. Selective media: These are solid media that contain substances that inhibit the growth of all but a few bacteria but at the same time facilitate isolation of certain bacteria. Some examples of selective media include: Thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose agar (TCBS) Deoxycholate citrate selective for Gram-negative yeast extract agar selective for certain Gram-negative bacteria, such as Legionella pneumophila. Some selective media used in routine microbiology laborato-ries are summarized in Table 4-3.Differential or indicator media: Differential or indicator media distinguish one microorganism from another growing on the same media by their growth characteristics. Key Points Differential or indicator media depend on the biochemi-cal properties of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators, such as neutral red, phe-nol red, eosin, or methylene blue. The medium changes color when a bacterium grows in them. For example, S. typhi grows as black colonies on Wilson and Blair medium containing sulfite. Lactose fermenting bacteria, such as E. coli produce pink colonies (Color Photo 2), whereas nonlactose fermenting bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. form pale or colorless colonies on MacConkey agar. Fermentation of lactose in the medium makes it acidic and leads to the formation of pink colonies in the presence of neutral red. Examples of differential media include: Eosin methylene blue (EMB), differential for AMCULTURE MEDIA 37Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 4 Mannitol salt agar (MSA), differential for mannitol fermentation; and X-gal plates, differential for lac operon mutants for detection of recombinant strains of bacteria for study in molecular biology. Transport media: Transport media are used to maintain the via-bility of certain delicate organisms in clinical specimens during their transport to the laboratory. They typically contain only buf-fers and salt. They lack carbon, nitrogen, and organic growth fac-tors, hence do not facilitate microbial multiplication. Examples of transport media are Stuart's transport medium for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Sugar media: Sugar media, basically contains 1% \"sugar\", which in microbiology denotes any fermentable substance, such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, and mannitol that is routinely used for fermentation tests. The sugar media shows the follow-ing characteristics: It consists of 1% sugar in peptone The indicator used in sugar media is Andrade's indicator that consists of 0.005% acid fuchsin in 1 N NaOH. The production of acid after fermentation of sugar is indicated by the change of color of the medium to pink due to the presence of indicator. Durham's tube is kept inverted inside the sugar tube to demonstrate the production of gas. Production of gas is indi-cated by the demonstration of gas bubble in Durham's tube. Nowadays, dehydrated media are available for wide use in diagnostic laboratories because of simplicity of procedure and being less cumbersome to prepare. These dehydrated media are prepared by simply reconstituting in distilled water and sterilizing it before use.Medium Colony characteristics Organisms inhibited Mannitol salt agarBig yellow colonies of Staphylococcus aureusSmall pink colonies Staphylococcus of Vibrio parahaemolyticusEnteric bacilli glass colonies of Legionella spp.Gram-positive cocci Lowenstein-Jensen mediumRough, tough, and fungi Most bacteria TABLE 4-3Some selective media used in routine microbiology laboratories Chap-04.indd 37 5/14/2012 11:48:52 AMCulture Methods5 Introduction Culture methods are very crucial in a microbiology laboratory. Various culture methods are carried out to: 1. Isolate bacteria in pure culture and identify the same by perf orming various tests. 2. Demonstrate biochemical, antigenic, and other phenotypic and genomic properties of the isolated colonies. 3. Demonstrate suscep tibility of the isolated bacteria to antibio tics, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, etc. 4. Prepare antigens for various uses. 5. Maintain stock culture. Methods of Culture Various methods are used for culturing of bacteria. These include (a) streak culture, (b) lawn culture, (c) pour-plate culture, (d ) stroke culture, (e) stab culture, and ( f ) liquid culture. Streak Culture Streak culture is the most useful method for obtaining discrete colonies of the bacteria. It is carried out by streaking on the surface of a solid media plate using a platinum or nichrome loop of 2-4 mm diameter. In this method, a loopful of the inoculum is placed near the peripheral area of the plate. The inoculum is then spread with the loop to about one-fourth of the plate with close parallel strokes. From the primary inoculum, it is spread thinly over the plate by streaking with the loop in parallel lines. The loop is flamed and cooled in between the streaks to obtain isolated colonies. The inoculated culture plate is incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight for demonstration of colonies. Confluent growth occurs at the primary inoculum, but becomes progressively thinner, and well-separated colonies are demonstrated on the final streaks of the inoculum (Fig. 5-1). Single isolated colonies obtained by this method are very useful to study various properties of bacteria. Streak culture is the most useful method for obtaining discrete colonies of the bacteria. Lawn Culture The lawn culture provides a uniform layer of bacterial growth on a solid medium. It is carried out by flooding the surface of the solid media plate with a liquid culture or suspension of bacteria, pipetting off the excess inoculum, and finally incubating the plate overnight at 37\u00b0C. Alternatively, the cul-ture plate may be inoculated by a sterile swab soaked in liquid bacterial culture or suspension and incubating overnight for demonstration of the bacterial colonies. Key Points Lawn culture method is useful: To carry out antibiotic sensitivity testing by disc diffusion method; To carry out bacteriophage typing; and To produce a large amount of bacterial growth required for preparation of bacterial antigens and vaccines. Pour-Plate Culture The pour-plate culture is used to determine approximate number of viable organisms in liquids, such as water or urine. It is used to quantitate bacteria in urine cultures and also to estimate the viable bacterial count in a suspension. This method is carried out in tubes, each containing 15 mL of molten agar. The molten agar in tubes is left to cool in a water bath at 45\u00b0C. The inoculum to be tested is diluted in serial dilution. Then 1 mL each of diluted inoculum is added to each tube of molten agar and mixed well. The contents of tubes are poured into sterile Petri dishes and allowed to set. After overnight incubation of these Petri dishes at 37\u00b0C, colonies are found to be distributed throughout the depth of the medium, which can be counted using a colony counter. Stroke Culture Stroke culture provides a pure growth of bacteria for carrying out slide agglutination and other diagnostic tests. It is carried out in tubes usually containing nutrient agar slopes. Stab Culture Stab culture is prepared by stabbing the medium in tubes with a long, straight wire and incubating at 37\u00b0C. Key Points Stab culture is frequently used for: Maintaining stock cultures. Demonstration of oxygen requirement of bacteria. Demonstration of gelatin liquefaction of bacteria. Chap-05.indd 38 5/14/2012 11:48:21 AMCULTURE METHODS 39Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 5 Liquid Culture Liquid culture is prepared in a liquid media enclosed in tubes, flasks, or bottles. The medium is inoculated by touching with a charged loop or by adding the inoculum with pipettes or syringes and incubating at 37\u00b0C, followed by subculture on to solid media for final identification. Key Points Liquid culture is specifically used: For blood culture and for sterility tests, where the concen-tration of bacteria is expected to be small; For culture of specimens containing antibiotics and other antibacterial substances, as these are rendered ineffective by dilutions in the medium; and When large yields of bacteria are required. A major disadvantage of liquid culture is that it does not provide pure culture of the bacteria and also the bacterial growth does not exhibit special characteristic appearances. Anaerobic Culture Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only in the absence of oxygen. These anaerobes are killed when exposed to the atmosphere for as briefly as 10 minutes. Some anaer-obes are tolerant to small amounts of oxygen. Facultative anaerobes are those anaerobes that grow with or without oxygen. Anaerobic bacterial culture is a method used to grow anaer- obes from a clinical specimen. Culture and identification of anaerobes is essential for initiating appropriate treatment. The failure to do so may have serious consequences, such as amputation, organ failure, sepsis, meningitis, and even death. Specimen Collection Specimens frequently used for anaerobic culture include: Blood, bile, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, direct lung aspirate, and tissue biopsy from a normally sterile site; Fluid aspirated from a normally sterile site, such as a joint; Pus specimens from dental abscess, burn wound, abdominal or pelvic abscess; and Specimens from knife, gunshot, or surgical wounds. Collection of a contamination-free specimen and protecting it from oxygen exposure during collection form the mainstay of anaerobic culture. The specimens need to be obtained from an appropriate site without contaminating the sample with bacteria from the adjacent skin, mucous membrane, or tissue. Abscesses or fluids are usually collected by using a sterile syringe and is then tightly capped to prevent entry of air. Tissue samples are placed into a degassed bag and sealed, or into a gassed out screw top vial that may contain oxygen-free prereduced culture medium and tightly capped. The specimens need to be plated as rapidly as possible onto culture media for isolation of bacteria. Key Points Swabs are always avoided when collecting specimens for anaerobic culture because cotton fibers may be detrimental to anaerobes. Coughed throat discharge (sputum), rectal swab, nasal or throat swab, urethral swab, and voided urine are some of the speci-mens that are not suitable for processing anaerobic cultures.The inoculum is smeared thoroughly to form a well Loop is resterilized and parallel lines are drawn from primary strokes Loop is resterilized and zigzag lines are drawn from tertiary strokesAppearance of isolated colonies towards the tapering endLoop is resterilized and parallel lines are drawn from secondary strokesLoop is resterilized and parallel lines are drawn from the well FIG. 5-1. Diagrammatic representation showing streak culture. Chap-05.indd 39 5/14/2012 III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 40Section I Chapter 5Culture Media The commonly used media for anaerobic culture include Robertson cooked meat broth, thioglycollate broth, Willis and Hobbs' media, and neomycin blood agar. Robertson cooked meat (RCM) broth is the most widely used medium in an anaer-obic culture. It consists of nutrient broth and pieces of fat-free minced cooked meat of ox heart with a layer of sterile liquid paraffin over it. Unsaturated fatty acids and even glutathione and cysteine present in the meat extract utilize oxygen for auto-oxidation. The medium before inoculation is usually boiled at 80\u00b0C in a water bath to make the medium free of oxygen. The media after inoculation and incubation allows the growth of even strict anaerobes and also indicates their saccharolytic or proteolytic activities as meat is turned red or black, respectively. Methods of Anaerobic Culture Anaerobic cultures are carried out in an environment that is free of oxygen, followed by incubation at 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C) for at least 48 hours before the plates are examined for growth. The cultures of anaerobic bacteria are carried out as follows: 1. McIntosh-Fildes anaerobic jar: It is the most widely used and dependable method of anaerobiosis (Color Pho to 3). It consists of a glass or metal jar with a metal lid that can be clamped air tight with the help of a screw. The lid has one inlet tube and another outlet tube. The outlet tube is connected to a vacuum pump by which the air is evacuated out of the jar. The inlet tube is connected to a source of hydrogen supply. The lid has two electric terminals also that can be connected to an electric supply. The underside of the lid contains a catalyst (e.g., alumina pellets coated with palladium) that catalyzes the combination of hydro-gen with residual oxygen present in the air. This method ensures complete anaerobiosis. The culture media are inoculated with the specimens suspected to contain anaerobic bacteria. The inoculated media are then kept inside the jar, and the lid is closed air tight. The anaerobiosis in the jar is carried out by first evacuating the air from the jar through outlet tube with the help of a vacuum pump. The outlet tube is closed, then the sealed jar containing the culture plates is replaced with hydrogen gas passed through inlet tube till reduced atmospheric pressure is brought to normal atmospheric pressure, which is monitored on the vacuum gauge as zero. The electrical terminals are then switched on to heat the catalyst that catalyzes combination of hydrogen with residual oxygen and ensures complete anaerobiosis in the jar. Reduced methylene blue is used as the indicator of anaerobiosis in the jar. If anaerobiosis is complete, it remains colorless; if anaerobiosis is not complete, it turns blue on exposure to oxygen. Gas pack system is a simple and effective method of production of hydrogen gas for anaerobiosis. It does not require the cumbersome method of evacuation and filing up of gases after evacuation. Carbon dioxide, which is also generated, is required for growth by some anaerobes. Water activates the gas pack system, resulting in the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen combines with oxygen in the air in the presence of catalyst and maintains anaerobiosis. In this method, the inoculated plates are kept along with the gas pack envelope with water added in the air tight jar. Key Points It is the method of choice for preparing anaerobic jars. It is commercially available as a disposable envelope containing chemicals that produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide on addi-tion of water. 2. Anaerobic glove box: The anaerobic glov e box is another innovation developed for isolating anaerobic bacteria. It is essentially a large clear-vinyl chamber with attached gloves, containing a mixture of 80% nitrogen, 10% hydrogen, and 10% carbon dioxide. A lock at one end of the chamber is fit-ted with two hatches, one leading to outside and the other to the inside of the chamber. Specimens are placed in the lock, the outside hatch is closed, and the air in the lock is evacu-ated and replaced with the gas mixture. The inside hatch is then opened to introduce the specimen into the chamber. 3. Anoxomat: This is a fully automated system that evacu- ates a portion of the jar contents and ref ills the jar with an anaerobic gas mixture. During this procedure, the oxygen concentration in the air is rarefied. For anaero-bic atmosphere, this procedure is repeated three times, after which the oxygen concentration is rarefied to 0.16%. A small catalyst removes this very small percentage of oxygen content. Anoxomat is capable of producing micro-aerophilic conditions also. The method is being increas-ingly used for processing clinical specimens for isolation of anaerobic bacteria. Chap-05.indd 40 5/14/2012 11:48:22 AMLaboratoryIdentification ofBacteria and Taxonomy6 Introduction It is not always possible to identify microorganisms by microscopic methods alone, due to similarity of bacteria in their morphology and staining characters. Hence, further study of microorganisms is essential for their identification. For this purpose, organisms have been grown artificially in the laboratory. Identification of Bacteria The complete identification of bacteria involves the following steps: (a ) morphology of bacterial colony on solid medium, (b) growth in liquid medium, (c ) biochemical reactions, (d ) antigenic structures, f ) antibiotic sensitivity, ( g ) typing of bacterial strains, (h ) rapid identification methods, and (i ) molecular methods. Morphology of Bacterial Colony on Solid Medium Morphology of the bacterial colony on solid medium depends on a number of factors, such as nature of culture medium, tem-perature and time of incubation, age of culture, and number of subcultures done. The characteristics noted are shape, size, surface, edge, elevation, opacity, color, and hemolysis of the colonies, as follows: The colonies may be a few millimeters in size: pinhead size (Staphylococcus aureus) or pinpoint (streptococci). The shape may be circular or irregular, and surface of the colonies may be smooth, rough, or granular. The colonies on the medium may be flat, raised, low convex, convex, or umbonate. The edge may be entire, lobate, crenated, undulate, or ciliate. The colonies may be transparent, translucent, or opaque. Certain bacterial colonies are associated with production of pigments and hemolysis around them. Growth in Liquid Medium Nutrient broth and peptone water are frequently used as liquid media for growth of bacteria. The characteristics of bacterial growth in liquid media provide some clue in presumptive iden-tification. For example, streptococci produce granular deposits at the bottom of the liquid medium, whereas most of the Gram-negative bacteria produce uniform turbidity. Pseudomonas spp. and other aerobic bacteria tend to produce surface pellicles in liquid media. The pigment production of some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be appreciated in liquid media. Smears prepared on glass slides from bacterial colonies grown on either solid or liquid media are examined for bacte-ria by appropriate staining. Gram staining is most widely used to differentiate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ziehl-Neelsen stain differentiates in Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Biochemical Reactions Biochemical reactions are very important in the identification of bacterial isolates and in the identification of different bacterial species. These tests depend on the presence of certain enzymes, such as catalase, oxidase, urease, gelatinase, etc., produced by the bacteria. Commonly used biochemical tests are described below: Catalase test Catalase test is used to detect the presence of enzyme catalase in a bacterium. The enzyme catalase catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide with the release of free oxygen. It is found in most aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. The main exception is Streptococcus spp. It is not found in anaerobes. 42Section I Chapter 6Red blood cells contain catalase and their presence, therefore, gives a false positive result. Catalase test is primarily used to differentiate Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. In this test, a small amount of culture to be tested is picked up from a nutrient agar plate with a sterile platinum loop or glass rod and this is inserted into hydrogen peroxide solution (3%) held on a slide or in a tube. Immediate production of air bubbles in the solution denotes a positive test and no bubbles indicate a negative test. Oxidase test This test determines the presence of enzyme oxidase in many bacteria. The enzyme oxidase catalyzes reduced reagent that contains tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride is the main reagent used in the oxidase test. The dye serves as an alternate substrate for the cytochrome oxidase reaction. In the reduced state, the reagent is colorless but when oxidized, it becomes purple. Oxidase test can be performed by several methods that include: (a) Dry filter paper method, (b) Wet filter paper method, and (c) Plate method. The dry f ilter paper method is performed by impregnating strips of filter paper with 1% Kovac's oxidase reagent. The paper is smeared with the bacterial colonies to be tested by a glass rod. In a positive test, the smeared area on the filter paper turns deep purple within 10 seconds. No color change indicates nega-tive test (Color Photo 4). Key Points of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Indole test Indole test is used to detect the ability of bacteria to decompose amino acid tryptophan to indole, which accumulates in the medium. Tryptophan or peptone broth is the medium used for indole test (Color Photo 5). The test is performed by inoculating the medium with bacteria, incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 hours. Then, 5 drops of hydro- chloric acid are added to the inoculated medium. Positive test is indicated by formation of a red ring at the surface of the medium. No color change indicates a negative test (Fig. 6-2). Precautions in interpretation of indole test are as follows: (a) cultures to be tested for indole production need to be incubated aerobically and (b) the optimum pH for tryptophanase activity is alkaline (pH 7.4-7.8), hence a decrease in pH results in decreased indole production and gives a possible false negative reaction.Key Points Indole-positive bacteria spp., and P. mirabilis. Carbohydrate fermentation test Carbohydrate fermentation test is done to determine the ability of a bacterium to ferment a specific carbohydrate incorporated in a basal medium, producing acid or acid with visible gas. The carbohydrates include glucose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, etc. The sugar medium contains 1% sugar. Andrade's indicator is a solution of acid fuchsin to which sodium hydroxide is added. It is a pH indicator that is added to the basal medium, which indicates the formation of organic acids. The test is performed by inoculating the sugar media with bacteria, incubating at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 hours. The change of the color to pinkish red (acidic) is considered as a positive test result, whereas yellow to colorless (alkaline) sugar indicates negative test result. Production of gas is indicated by appear-ance of gas bubbles in Durham's tube. Key Points All members of the family Enterobacteriaceae ferment glucose, whereas glucose and mannitol are fermented by Salmonella spp., and glucose and lactose are fermented by E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Oxidation-fermentation test Oxidation-fermentation test (OF test) determines the oxida-tive or fermentative metabolism of a carbohydrate by a bacte-rium. The OF test is used to determine whether a bacterium has the enzymes necessary for the aerobic breakdown of glucose Positive Negative FIG. 6-2. Indole test. Chap-06.indd 42 5/14/2012 12:37:34 PMLABORATORY IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA AND TAXONOMY 43Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 6(i.e., oxidation) and/or for the fermentation of glucose. The test differentiates Enterobacteriaceae (fermenters) from the mem-bers of the family Pseudomonadaceae iron agar/triple sugar iron agar test Kligler's iron agar (KIA) and triple sugar iron agar (TSI) tests are used to determine the ability of an organism to attack a specific carbohydrate incorporated into a basal growth medium, with or without the production of gas, along with production of hydrogen sulfide. KIA medium contains two carbohydrates: lactose and glucose in a ratio of 10:1. TSI con-tains a third carbohydrate, i.e., sucrose, in addition to lactose and glucose. The test is performed by inoculating KIA or TSI with an inoculating needle by stabbing the butt and streaking the slant and then incubating at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 hours. During incubation, the bacterium first utilizes glucose and then lactose and sucrose. After 18-24 hours, the glucose concentration is depleted in the slant and in the butt. The bacteria start oxidative degradation of the peptone present in the slant, resulting in the production of alkaline by-products, thereby changing the indicator to a red color. Anaerobic fermentation of glucose in the butt produces a large volume of acid, which neutralizes the alkalinity caused by peptone degradation; hence the butt continues to remain yellow. Yellow color (acidic), therefore, indicates fermentation of carbohydrates and red color (alkaline) indicates no fermentation. Presence of bubble in the butt indicates production of gas during fermentation of carbohydrates. Certain bacteria produce H 2S, which is detected as black precipitate that blackens the slant and butt of the medium. The medium is turned black due to combination of H 2S with ferric ions, from ferric salts present in the medium, to form ferrous sulfide as black precipitates. Three basic fermentation patterns are observed on KIA medium after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours: 1. Fermentation of glucose only (alkali/acid or K/A reaction; denotes denotes acidic reaction): After 18-24 hours, the low glucose concentration is com pletely used up, and the organism starts to utilize the peptones present in the medium, resulting in an alkaline pH in slant (red). In the butt, a yellow color exists due to anaerobic degradation of glucose. 2. Fermentation of lactose and glucose (acid/acid or A/A reaction): Lactose is present in 10 times the amount of glucose. In 18-24 hours, the lactose is not deple ted and therefore acidic conditions exist in the butt and slant. 3. Neither lactose nor glucose fermented (alkali/alkali or K/K reaction): Many Gram-negativ e, nonenteric bacilli are unable to ferment glucose or lactose. A reaction of K/K is a result of aerobic catabolism of peptone by the organism. H 2S production and carbohydrate fermentation patterns are generally characteristic for specific bacterial groups, especially the Enterobacteriaceae. Urease test Urease test is used to determine the ability of an organism to split urea to ammonia by the enzyme urease. Production of ammonia makes the medium alkaline; thus the indicator phe-nol red changes to red or pink in color. The test is performed in Christensen's urease medium. The medium is inoculated with the bacterial colony and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Urease-positive bacteria produce a pink color. Key Points Urease test is useful for screening the production of urease positive\u2014usually within 6 Another example of urease producing organism is Helicobacter Pylori, the production of which is essential for its survival in the acidic pH of the stomach. Citrate test Citrate test is used to demonstrate the ability of an organism to utilize citrate as the sole source of carbon for metabolism. Koser's citrate medium (a liquid medium) and Simmon's citrate medium (a solid medium) are used for the test. In this test, either of the medium is inoculated with the bacteria and then incu-bated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Growth on the Simmon's medium is accompanied by a rise in pH to change the medium from its initial green color to deep blue. Hence, growth with blue color on the slant indicates positive test and no growth without any color change indicates negative test. The medium needs to be lightly inoculated (from plate cultures, not from a broth) to avoid a carryover of nutrients, which may lead to a false positive result. In Koser's liquid medium, turbidity indicates positive test and absence of turbidity indicates negative test. Phenylalanine deaminase test Phenylalanine deaminase test indicates the ability of an organism to deaminate phenylalanine to phenylpyruvic acid (PPA), which reacts with ferric salts to give green color. This test is also called PPA test. The test is performed by inoculating the medium containing phenylalanine by the bacteria. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, a few drops of 10% ferric chloride solution are added to the inoculated medium. If PPA is produced, the medium becomes green in color due to combination of ferric chloride with PPA, which indicates a positive test. Absence of any color change indicates a negative test. PPA-positive bacteria are Proteus reduction test Nitrate reduction test is used to determine the presence of enzyme nitrate reductase in the bacteria. The enzyme reduces nitrate to nitrites or free nitrogen gas. The test is carried out by inoculating the broth containing 1% potassium nitrate (KNO 3) and incubating at 37\u00b0C up to 5 days. Then 1-2 drops of a reagent that consists of a mixture of 1 mL of naphthylamine Chap-06.indd 43 5/14/2012 12:37:35 PMSection III Chapter I Chapter 6and 1 mL of sulfanilic acid is added. Red color developing within a few minutes signifies positive reaction, while absence of color indicates negative reaction. Key Points Nitrate reduction test is used mainly for the identification of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, which are usually positive for nitrate reduction test. Methyl red test Methyl red (MR) test detects the ability of an organism to produce and maintain stable acid end products during the fermentation of glucose, thereby maintaining a sustained pH below 4.5. The test is performed by inoculating a glucose phosphate broth and incubating it at 37\u00b0C for 2-5 days. Five drops of 0.04% of MR solution are then added to the inocu-lated medium, mixed, and the result is read immediately. Development of red color denotes a positive test, and yellow color indicates negative test. E. coli, Yersinia spp., and Listeria monocytogenes are the examples of MR-test-positive bacteria. It should be noted that if the MR test is performed too early, the results may produce a false positive reaction. This is because MR-negative organisms may not have adequate time to completely metabolize the initial acid products that have been produced during the fermentation of glucose. Key Points Methyl red test is commonly used to differentiate E. coli (MR positive) from Enterobacter (MR negative) and Yersinia spp. (MR positive) from other Gram-negative, non-enteric bacteria (MR negative). Voges-Proskauer test Voges-Proskauer (VP) test detects the production of acetyl methyl carbinol (acetoin), a natural product formed from pyruvic acid in the course of glucose fermentation. The acetoin, in the presence of alkali and atmospheric oxygen, is oxidized to diacetyl that reacts with alpha-naphthol to produce red color. This test is performed by inoculating the glucose phosphate broth with the organism and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. Then approximately 3 drops of alpha-naphthol is added followed by addition of 1 drop of 40% potassium hydroxide. The reagents are mixed well and are allowed to stand for 30 minutes. In positive test, pink color appears in 2-5 minutes, deepening to magenta in half an hour. The solution remains colorless for 30 minutes in negative test. Staphylococcus biotype eltor, Klebsiella examples of VP-test-positive bacteria. Key Points Indole, MR, VP, and citrate test commonly referred to as \"IMViC tests\" are the most frequently used tests in the identification of enteric, Gram-negative bacteria. Hydrogen sulfide production These tests are carried out to demonstrate H2S produced by certain bacteria. Production of H2S is demonstrated by inoculating the bacteria in the media containing lead acetate, ferric ammonium citrate, or ferrous acetate and incubating overnight at 37\u00b0C. H 2S-producing bacteria by their enzymatic actions produce H2S from sulfur-containing amino acids in the medium. Production of sulfur produces black color in the media, visible to the naked eye. Filter paper strip is another method of demonstration of production of H 2S. In this method, filter paper strip impreg- nated with lead acetate is kept between the cotton plug and the medium in the tube. Production of H 2S is indicated by blackening of the paper. P. mirabilis , P. vulgaris , and Salmonella spp. are some of the H2S-producing bacteria. Antigenic Structures Agglutination of biochemically confirmed bacteria with specific antisera facilitates further identification of the isolated bacteria. Agglutination test is used in the identification of presumptive isolates of pathogens (e.g., Salmonella ) from clinical samples. It is also used for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Animal Pathogenicity Some pathogenic bacteria and their bacterial metabolites produce characteristic lesions in laboratory animals. The most commonly employed animals are rats, guinea pigs, mice, and rabbits. These animals, depending on the organisms to be tested, may be inoculated by subcutaneous, intramus cular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intracerebral routes. The iden-tification of the bacteria is made depending on the postmor-tem findings and cultural properties of the bacteria. For example, guinea pigs are commonly used for performing animal pathogenicity of C. diphtheriae, Clostridium perfringens, and M. tuberculosis. Antibiotic Sensitivity Determination of antibiotic sensitivity of an isolate from a patient is essential for the choice of drug therapy. In some cases, sensitivity of an organism to a particular agent helps in the identification, e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes is sensitive to bacitracin and Streptococcus pneumoniae to optochin. The sensitivity to the antibiotic can be determined by disc diffusion test, serial dilu-tion tests, and E-test, as described in detail in Chapter 9. Typing of Bacterial Strains The ability to discriminate between similar strains of bacte-ria may be important in tracing sources or modes of spread of infection in a community. Typing methods are widely used for epidemiological studies. These include (a) phenotypic techniques and (b) genotypic techniques. Chap-06.indd 44 5/14/2012 12:37:35 PMLABORATORY IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA AND TAXONOMY 45Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 6 Phenotypic techniques Phenotyping techniques depend on various observable properties of bacteria, which are discussed as follows: Biotyping: It relies on a set of biochemical reactions to dis-tinguish different strains within a given species. Antimicro-bial susceptibility testing is an example of this type. Serotyping: Different strains of organisms of the same species can be differentiated based on the difference in the expression of antigenic determinants on the cell surface. Bacteriocin typing: This is used in case of bacterial species for which a number of lytic bacteriophages have been identified. Phage typing: This has been the mainstay of strain discrim-ination and is widely used in epidemiological studies. Genotypic techniques Genotypic techniques depend on differences related to the genome of bacteria. Genotypic techniques employed to differentiate strains of bacteria include plasmid profile analysis and restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal DNA. Rapid Identification Methods Automated methods are now available, which take only hours for characterization of isolates. These include detection of specific enzymes, toxins, antigens, or metabolic end prod-ucts. Obligate anaerobes by gas liquid chromatography of short-chain fatty acids produced by them. Latex particle agglutination, coagglutination, fluo- rescent antibody test, and dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the most frequently used techniques in the clinical laboratory for rapid detection of microbial antigens directly in clinical specimens. Antibody to a specific antigen is bound to latex particles or to a heat-killed and treated protein A-rich strain of S. aureus to produce agglutination. Molecular Methods Molecular methods, such as nucleic acid probes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other amplification procedures are also used increasingly nowadays for identification of micro-organisms. Genetic probes are based on the detection of unique nucleotide sequences with the DNA or RNA of a microorganism. Hybridization of the sequence with a complementary sequence of DNA or RNA follows cleavage of the double-stranded DNA of the microorganism in the specimen. PCR has major applications in the detection of infections due to microorganisms that are difficult to culture (e.g., the human immunodeficiency virus) or that have not as yet been successfully cultured (e.g., the Whipple's disease bacillus). Bacterial Taxonomy Bacterial taxonomy comprises: (a) bacterial classification of organism and ( b) nomenclature or naming of the microbial isolates.Bacterial Classification Bacterial classification may be defined as the arrangement of organisms into taxonomic groups ( taxa) on the basis of their phenotypic (observable) and genotypic (genetic) simi-larities and differences. It allows proper and systematic grouping of microorganisms. Organisms are classified into three main kingdoms: Animals, Plants, and Protista. The Protista contains unicellular microorganisms includ-ing eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Although no univer-sally accepted bacterial classification system is available, three main approaches are usually followed. These include (a) phylogenetic, (b ) Adansonian, and ( c) genetic are discussed below: Phylogenetic classification The phylogenetic classification is a type of hierarchical classi-fication that represents a branching tree-like arrangement, one characteristic being employed for divisions at each branch or level. It is called phylogenetic classification, because it denotes an evolutionary arrangement of species. This classification groups together the types that are related on evolutionary basis where several groups are used, such as Divisions, Classes, Orders, Families, Tribes, Genera, and Species. Some characters of special importance, such as Gram stain-ing properties, lactose fermentation, spore formation, etc., are used to differentiate major groups, whereas less important properties, such as nutritional requirements for growth of bacteria, production of certain enzymes by bacteria, etc., are employed to distinguish minor groups, such as the genera and species. As per the classification, the full taxonomical position of a bacterium (say, E. coli) can be an authoritative published compilation that describes a phylogenetic classifica-tion of bacteria. The manual is a useful compilation of names and descriptions of bacteria and is the most standard refer-ence book accepted worldwide. The book is extremely useful for identification of newly isolated bacterial types. A minimum number of important characters, such as morphology of the bacteria, staining properties, cultural characteristics, biochemi-cal reactions, antigenic structure, and guanine to cytosine ratio of DNA, etc., are used for identification and classification of bacteria. Adansonian classification The Adansonian classification makes no phylogenetic assump-tion, but considers all the characteristics expressed at the time of Chap-06.indd 45 5/14/2012 12:37:35 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 46Section I Chapter 6the study. Hence it is called a phonetic system. The Adansonian classification was first proposed by Michael Adanson in the eighteenth century. It avoids the use of weighted characteristics. This classification gives equal weight to all measurable features and groups of bacteria on the basis of similarities of several characteristics. Recently, availability of computer facilities has expanded the scope of phonetic classification by permitting comparison of very large number of properties of several organisms at the same time. The computer analysis of large number of charac-teristics of a bacterium facilitates the identification of several broad subgroups of bacterial strains that are further subdi-vided into species. This type of classification, based on the properties of large number of properties, is known as numeri-cal taxonomy. Genetic classification The genetic or molecular classification is based on homology of the DNA base sequences of the microorganisms. DNA relatedness of the microorganisms is tested first by extract-ing DNA from the organism to be studied, and then study-ing the nucleotide sequence of DNA by DNA hybridization or recombination methods. The degree of hybridization can be assessed by many methods, such as by using labeled DNA preparations. The study of messenger RNA (mRNA) also provides useful information on genetic relatedness among bacteria. The anal-ysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) has proved to be of immense value. Study of the nucleotide sequence of 16S ribosomal RNA from different biologic sources has shown evolution-ary relationships among widely divergent organisms and has contributed to the understanding of new groups of bacte-ria, such as the archaebacteria. Genetic classification is now increasingly used for study of viruses. Intraspecies classification Intraspecies classification makes an attempt to subclassify species of a bacteria based on biochemical properties (bio-types), antigenic properties (serotypes), susceptibility to bacte-riophage (phage types), and production of bacteriocins (colicin types). Recently, molecular methods have increasingly been used for intraspecies classification of microorganisms, espe-cially viruses. Key Points Molecular methods of intraspecies classification are broadly of two types\u2014phenotypic and genotypic. Phenotypic methods are based primarily on the study of expressed characteristics by microorganisms and are carried out by performing elec-trophoretic typing of bacterial proteins and immunoblot-tings. Genotypic methods include direct analysis of genes and chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA. These genotypic methods include plasmid profile analysis, restriction endonu-clease analysis of chromosomal DNA with Southern blotting, PCR, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Nomenclature of Microorganisms Nomenclature refers to the naming of microorganisms. The nomenclature of microorganisms is governed by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology and published as Approved List of Bacterial Names in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology . This confers and maintains uniformity for use of names of microorganisms accepted internationally. Similarly, the nomenclature and classification of viruses are governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Two kinds of names are usually given to bacteria\u2014common name and scientific name: (a) The common or casual name for a microorganism varies from countr y to country and is usually known in the local language. For example tubercle bacillus, typhoid bacillus, gonococcus are common names for communication at the local level. (b) The scientific name is the international name that is accepted throughout the world. By accepted taxonomic conventions, the order names end in ales (e.g., the order Eubacteriales), family names end in aceae (e.g., the family Enterobacteriaceae), and the tribe names end in eae (e.g., the tribe Proteae). The order, family, and tribe names begin withcapital letters. The genus name also begins with capital let-ter, but species name (e.g., coli) begins with running letter and not capital letter. Both the genus (e.g., Escherichia) and species names are either italicized or underlined when written in the text. The scientific name of the bacterium when written for the first time, is written in full (e.g., Escherichia coli), but later mentioned in an abbreviated form (e.g., Escherichia coli). When bacteria are referred to as a group, their names are neither capitalized nor italicized or underlined (e.g., streptococci). Chap-06.indd 46 5/14/2012 12:37:35 PMBacterial Genetics7 Introduction Genetics is the study of heredity and variation to understand the cause of resemblance and differences between parents and their progeny. The term genetics was coined by William Bateson, a British biologist, in 1906. The unit of heredity is the gene, a segment of deoxyribo- nucleic acid (DNA) that carries in its nucleotide sequence information for a specific biochemical or physiologic property. All hereditary properties are encoded in DNA. Hence, the chro-mosomal DNA plays an important role in the maintenance of character from generation to generation. Genes carry the information to code for all the necessary components and the actions of life. The genes at each cell division are replicated and a copy is transmitted to each daughter cell. Although heritability and variations in bacteria have been observed from the early days of bacteriology, it was not known then that bacteria too obey the laws of genetics. It was not until the 1950s that DNA was recognized as the building material of genes. Bacteria unlike eukaryotic cells (such as human cells) are haploid (1n), which means they have a single copy of each gene. In contrast, eukaryotic cells are diploid (2n); in other words, they have a pair of each chromosome and therefore two copies of each gene. The genotype of an organism is the specific set of genes it possesses. Chromosomal Substances Structure of DNA The DNA is the key basic component of gene, which carries the genetic information that is transcribed onto ribonucleic acid and then translated as the particular polypeptide. The basic structure of DNA molecule was first described by Watson and Crick for which they were honored with the Nobel Prize in Medicine. The DNA molecule is composed of two strands of complementary nucleotides wound together in the form of a double helix. The double helix has a diameter of 2 nm. Each full turn of the double helix contains 10 nucleotide pairs and is 3.4 nm in length. DNA strand Each DNA strand has a backbone of deoxyribose (sugar) and phosphate group residues arranged alternately. It has a sugar-phosphate backbone substituted with purine and pyrimidine bases. It contains four nitrogenous bases, two (adenine and guanine), and two pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine). The two complementary strands are held together by hydro- gen bonds between the nitrogenous bases on the opposite strands. The hydrogen bonding follows a specific binding manner in which hydrogen bonds are formed only between guanine and cytosine and between adenine and thymine. Guanine and cytosine form a complementary base pair and adenine and thymine form another base pair. A molecule of DNA therefore contains as many units of adenine as thymine and of guanine as cytosine. For example, when the arrangement of bases along one strand is AGCTAG, the arrangement on the other strand will be TCGATC. The ratio of adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine is constant for each species, but varies widely from one bacterial species to another. During replication, the DNA molecule replicates, first by unwinding at one end to form a fork and then by separation of strands at the other end. Each strand then acts as a template for the synthesis of a complementary strand with which it then forms a double helix. Gene It is a segment of DNA that carries codons specifying for a particular polypeptide. A DNA molecule consists of a large num-ber of genes, each of which contains hundreds of thousands of nucleotides. The DNA of a bacterial chromosome is usually arranged in a circular form and when straightened, it measures around 1000 . The length of DNA is usually expressed as kilo-bases (1 kbp = 1000 base pairs, or bp). Bacterial DNA measures usually 4000 kbp and the human genome about 3 million kbp. Key Points The DNA of Escherichia coli is most extensively studied. Typically, it consists of a single circular DNA molecule con-sisting of approximately 5 /H11003 10 6 bp. It has a molecular weight of 2 /H11003 109. This amount of genetic information in the bacteria can code for about 2000 proteins with an average molecular weight of 50,000 kDa. Structure of RNA Basically, the structure of RNA is similar to that of DNA except for two major differences: (a) In DNA, the sugar is D-2-deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is D-ribose. Chap-07.indd 47 5/14/2012 11:47:27 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 48Section I Chapter 7 (b) The RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil instead of thymine that is present in DNA . On the basis of structure and function, the RNA can be differentiated into three types: (a) Messenger RNA (mRNA), (b) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and (c) Transfer RNA (tRNA). The RNA molecules range in size from the small tRNAs (which cont ain fewer than 100 bases) to mRNAs (which may carry genetic messages extending to several thousand bases). Bacterial ribo-somes contain three kinds of rRNA with respective sizes of 120, 1540, and 2900 bases and a number of proteins. Corresponding rRNA molecules in eukaryotic ribosomes are somewhat larger. A few RNA molecules have been shown to function as enzymes (ribozymes). For example, the 23S RNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond during protein synthesis. Some small RNA molecules (sRNA) function as regulators either (a) by binding near the 5' end of an mRNA, preventing ribosomes from translating that message, or (b) by base pairing directly with a strand of DNA near the promoter, preventing transcription. Key Points The most common function of RNA is communication of DNA gene sequences in the form of mRNA to ribosomes. For the synthesis of mRNA, DNA acts as a template; hence adenine, guanine, guanine, adenine, respectively, in DNA. The ribosomes, which contain rRNA and proteins, translate this message into the primary structure of proteins via aminoacyl-tRNAs. Mutations Mutation is a random, undirected, and heritable variation seen in DNA of the cell. This is caused by a change in base sequence of DNA due to addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more bases in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. It can involve any of the genes present in the bacterial chromosome. Mutation results in insertion of a different amino acid into a protein, resulting in the appearance of an altered phenotype. Types of Mutations Mutations are a natural event occurring in dividing cells. The frequency of mutations ranges from 10 2 to 1010 per bacterium per division. These occur spontaneously or are enhanced by different mutagens. Mutations are of three types: (a) base sub-stitution, (b) frame-shift mutation, and (c) mutations due to transposons or insertion sequences. Mutation due to base substitution This type of mutation occurs when one base in the nucleotide sequence is inserted in place of another. This occurs during replication of DNA either due to an error in the function of DNA polymerase or due to a mutagen that alters the hydrogen bonding of the base being used as a template in such a manner that the wrong base is inserted. The base substitution mutation may be of two types: missense mutation and nonsense mutation.A. Missense mutation: It is one in which the base substitution results in a codon that specifies a different amino acid to be inserted.B. Nonsense mutation: It is another type of mutation in which the base substitution produces a terminal codon that stops synthesis of protein prematurely. Entire protein function is destroyed during the process of nonsense mutation. Frame-shift mutation It is the second type of mutation. This occurs when one or more base pairs are added or deleted in the DNA. This, therefore, leads to shifting of the reading frame of the ribosome that results in incorporation of the wrong amino acids downstream from the mutation. Result of the frame-shift mutation ends in production of an inactive protein. Mutation due to transposons or insertion sequence This is the third type of mutation that occurs when transpo-sons or insertion sequences are integrated into the DNA. These newly inserted pieces of DNA cause profound changes in the gene into which they are inserted and also causes changes in the adjacent genes. Causative Agents of Mutation Mutation can be caused by ( a) viruses, (b) radiation, or (c) chemicals. Viruses Bacterial viruses (mutator bacteriophage) are an example of viruses that cause a high frequency of mutation by inserting their DNA into the bacterial chromosome. Mutations can occur in various genes as viral DNA can insert bacterial chromosome at many different sites. The mutations caused by these viruses may be either frame-shift mutations or deletions. Radiations X-rays and ultraviolet light are the examples of radiation that can cause mutation in chromosomal DNA. X-rays: X-rays damage DNA in many ways. They cause damage by producing free radicals that can attack the bases or alter them in the stran d, thereby changing their hydro- gen bonding. They also damage DNA by breaking the cova- lent bonds that hold the ribose phosphate together. Ultraviolet light: Ultraviolet radiation causes damage in DNA by cross-linking of the adjacent pyrimidine bases to form dimers. For exam ple, the cross-linking of adjacent thymine to form thymine dimers results in the inability of DNA to replicate properly. Chap-07.indd 48 5/14/2012 11:47:28 AMBACTERIAL GENETICS 49Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 7 Chemicals Various chemicals, such as nitrous acid, alkylating agents, benzpyrene, and base analogs, such as 5-bromouracil cause mutation in several different ways: Benzpyrene: This is commonly present in tobacco smoke that binds to existing DNA bases and causes frame-shift mutations. The benzpyrene, which is a carcinogen as well as a mutagen, intercalates between the adjacent bases, thereby distorting and offsetting the nucleotide sequence in the DNA. Nitrous acid and alkylating agents: They act by altering the existing base in the DNA. This results in formation of a hydrogen bond with a wrong base. For example, adenine does not form bond with thymine but makes wrong pair with cytosine. Base analogs: Base analogs, such as 5-bromouracil, have less hydrogen bonding capacity than thymine, so they bind to guanine with better frequency. This results in a mutation due to a transition from AT base pair to a GC base pair. Iododeoxyuridine, an antiviral drug, also acts as a base-pair analog. Effects of Mutations Mutations in the bacteria cause a lot of changes in their various properties. Mutation alter drug susceptibility, anti-genic structure, and virulence of mutant bacteria. It also alter susceptibility of bacteria to bacteriophages, alter their colony morphology and pigment productions, and affect their ability to produce capsule or flagella. Development of drug resistance due to mutations in bacteria is a major health concern. Conditional Lethal Mutation Lethal mutations occur when some mutations involve vital functions, resulting in production of nonviable mutants. On the other hand, a conditional lethal mutation is a form of lethal mutation, in which mutation is expressed only under certain conditions, resulting in production of viable mutants. This is of medical importance, because it is made use for preparation of vaccine strains. Temperature-sensitive strains are the most common example of conditional lethal mutations. The temperature-sensitive organisms have the unique property of replicating at a low permissive temperature, such as 32/H11034 C but cannot grow at a higher restrictive temperature, such as 37/H11034 C. This is due to a mutation that causes changes in an amino acid in an essential protein, allowing these organisms to function at 32 /H11034C but not at 37/H11034 C. Temperature- sensitive influenza virus strain used in experimental vaccine is an example of conditional lethal mutations. This influenza vaccine contains a virus that can grow at 32/H11034 C and infect nose and can replicate and induce immunity. But the virus cannot grow at 37/H11034 C, hence cannot infect the lungs and does not cause pneumonia.Extrachromosomal DNA Substances Plasmids Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA substances. They are replicons that are maintained as discrete, extrachromosomal genetic elements in bacteria. They are usually much smaller than the bacterial chromosome, varying from less than 5 to more than several 100 kbp. However, plasmids as large, as 2 million base pairs can occur in some bacteria. Plasmids are circular and double-stranded DNA molecules that encode traits that are not essential for bacterial viability. They are capable of replicating independently of the bacterial chromosomes. The plasmids can also be present as integrated with bacterial chromosomes, and plasmids integrated with host chromosome are known as episomes. Plasmids are present in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Types of plasmids Plasmids depending on their transmissibility and nature of the factor can be of the following types: Transmissibility of plasmids Plasmids, depending on transmissibility and (b) nontransmissible plasmids. 1. Transmissible plasmids: They can be transferred from cell to cell by a process of gene tic transfer known as conju- gation. They are large (mol. wt. 40-100 million) plasmids. They contain more than a dozen genes responsible for synthesis of the sex pilus and for the synthesis of enzymes required for their transfer. Usually, one to three copies of the plasmid are present in a cell. 2. Nontransmissible plasmids: These cannot be transf erred from cell to cell, because they do not contain the transfer genes. They are small (mol. wt. 3-20 million), usually non-conjugative, and have high copy numbers (typically 10-60 per chromosome). They depend on their bacterial host to provide some functions required for replication and are distributed randomly between daughter cells at division. Nature of factors Depending on the nature of factors, plasmids are of the following types: (a) the F factor, (b) the R factor, and (c) the Col factor. 1. The F factor: The F plasmid, also called F factor, is a transfer factor that contains the genetic information, essential for controlling mating process of the bacteria during conjugation. The F plasmid of Escherichia coli is the prototype for fertility plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria. Strains of E. coli with an extrachromosomal F plasmid are called F/H11001 and function as donors, whereas strains that lack the F plasmid are F and behave as recipients. The conjugative functions of the F plasmid are determined by a cluster of at least 25 transfer (tra) genes. These genes determine (a) expression Chap-07.indd 49 5/14/2012 11:47:28 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 50Section I Chapter 7Plasmids carry genes for the following: 1. Resistance to antibiotics that is mediated by a variety of enzymes. 2. Resistance to ultraviolet light that is mediated by DNA repair enzymes. 3. Resistance to heavy metals such as mercury and silver that is mediated b y enzyme reduct ase. 4. Pili that mediate the adherence of bacteria to epithelial cells. Exam ples include K88, K99 found in uropathogenic E. coli. 5. Exotoxins including many enterotoxins. Representative toxins by plasmids include heat-labile and heat-st able entero tox- ins of E. coli, exfoliative toxin of Staphylococcus aureus, hemolysins of Clostridium perfringens, and tetanus toxin of Clostridium tetani. 6. Bacteriocins produced by certain Gram-negative bacteria are lethal for o ther bacteria. Examples include pyocin produced by P. pyocyanea and diphthericin produced by C. diphtheriae. 7. A varie ty of enzymes such as urease of Helicobacter pylori and pro teases of Pseudomonas spp. degradative properties. The degradative enzymes produced by Pseudomonas spp. are capable of cleaning of oil spills and toxic chemical wastes in the environment.Box 7-1 Plasmid-determined propertiesof pili, (b) synthesis and transfer of DNA during mating, (c) interference with the ability of F/H11001 bacteria to serve as recipients, and (d) other functions. The F plasmid in E. coli can occur as an extrachromosomal genetic element or be integrated into the bacterial chromo-some. Both the F plasmid and the bacterial chromosome are circular DNA molecules. Hence, reciprocal recombination between them produces a larger DNA circle consisting of F-plasmid DNA inserted linearly into the chromosome. 2. The R factor: Resist ance factors, also called R factors, are extrachromosomal plasmids. They are circular with double-stranded DNA. R factors occur in two sizes: large plasmids (mol. wt. 60 million) and small million). The large plasmids are conjugative \"R\" factors, which contain extra DNA to code for the conjugation process. The small plasmids contain only the \"r\" genes and are not conjugative. R factor consists of two components: the resistance transfer factor (RTF) and resistant determinant (r). The RTF is responsible for conjugational transfer, while each r determinant carries resistance for one of the several antibiotics. Key Points Functions of R factor: The R factors are responsible for spread of multiple-drug resistance among bacteria. They carry the genes for a vari-ety of enzymes that can destroy antibiotics and modify membrane transport system. The R factor may carry one antibiotic resistance gene or may carry two or more of these genes. The R factor carrying more than two genes has many clinical implications: First and foremost, a bacterium carrying such genes will show resistance to more than one type of antibiotics, such as penicillins and aminoglycosides. The second importance is that the use of an antibiotic that selects an organism for a bacterium resistant to one antibi-otic (such as penicillin) will select for a bacterium resistant to other antibiotics (such as tetracyclines, aminoglyco-sides, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, etc.). They may also carry genes for resistance to metal ions. For example, the genes code for an enzymes that reduce mercu-ric ions to elementary mercury, thereby making the bacte-ria resistant to action of mercuric ions. They also carry resistance to certain bacteriophages by coding for the enzymes, e.g., restriction endonucleases that degrade the DNA of the infecting bacteriophages. 3. Colicinogenic (Col) factor: Col factor is a plasmid that resembles the F factor in promoting conjugation, leading to self-transf er and also at times transfer of segments of chromosomes. The Col factor encodes for production of colicins, which are antibiotics-like substances that are specifically and selectively lethal to other enteric bacteria. They also encode for production of diphthericin and pyocyanin produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Pseudomonas pyocyanea, respectively, which are sub- stances similar to colicins. Functions of plasmids Many plasmids control medically important properties of patho-genic bacteria. These include (a ) resistance to one or several antibiotics, (b ) production of toxins, and (c ) synthesis of cell sur- face structures required for adherence or colonization. Plasmid-determined properties are summarized in Box 7-1. Some plasmids are cryptic and have no recognizable effects on the bacterial cells that harbor them. Comparing plasmid profiles is a useful method for assessing possible relatedness of individual clinical isolates of a particular bacterial species for epidemiological studies. Transfer of DNA Within Bacterial Cells Transfer of DNA within the bacterial cells can occur by ( a) trans- posons (b) integrative conjugating elements, and (c) programed rearrangement. Transposons Transposons are a type of mobile DNA of 2000-20,000 bp. They can transfer DNA from one site of the bacterial chromosome to another site or to a plasmid. The idea of trans-posons or jumping genes was first given by Barbara McClintock, a geneticist working in the field of maize genetics. The mode of genetic transfer by transposon is called transposition. The transposition differs from recombination in that a segment of DNA can be transferred from one to another molecule that has no genetic homology with either the transposable element or the donor DNA. Transposons do not occur independently but have the char- acteristic of jumping from one part of a chromosome to another or to a plasmid. They can also jump from one plasmid to another or back to the chromosome, hence, are called as jumping genes. Transposition in prokaryotes usually involves two steps\u2014self-replication and recombination. They jump from one part to Chap-07.indd 50 5/14/2012 11:47:28 AMBACTERIAL GENETICS 51Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 7another by synthesizing a copy of their DNA and inserting the copy at another site in the bacterial chromosome or the plas-mid. Transposons, unlike plasmids, are not self-replicating and depend on chromosomal or plasmid DNA for replication. Transposons do not require homology with the recipient site for its transfer. Transposons typically consist of four domains: The first domain is a short DNA sequence of inserted repeats that are present at the end. This domain mediates the inte-gration of the transposons into the recipient DNA. The second domain is the gene for the enzyme transposases. These enzymes mediate the excision and integration process. The third domain is the gene for the repressor, which regulates the synthesis of both transposase and the gene products of the fourth domain. The fourth domain is the gene for the expression of enzymes. Plasmid can contain several transposons carrying drug- resistance genes. The transposons code for drug-resistance enzymes, toxins, or a variety of metabolic enzymes. These transposons can either cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes.Insertion sequences: The simplest form of transposons is the insertion sequences. These are a type of transposons that have a few bases varying from 800 to 1500 bp. They are found as multiple copies at the end of larger transposon units. These cause mutation by moving from one side to another in DNA sequence and are believed to control various cellular responses. Integrative Conjugative Elements Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are ways of horizontal gene transfer and self-transmissible mobile genetic elements. The elements exchange by conjugation, but need to integrate into chromosome to propagate. They cannot replicate autono-mously. ICEs integrate into and replicate along with the host cell chromosome, whereas plasmids exist as extra-chromosomal (usually circular) autonomously replicating DNA molecules. Programed Rearrangements The transfer of DNA within bacteria can also occur by programed rearrangement. In this programed rearrangement, there is a move-ment of a gene from a silent site where the gene is not expressed to an active site where transcription and translation occur. Many silent genes are present in the DNA that encode vari- ants of the antigens. Presentation of the new gene into the active site occurs in a sequential and repeated manner, which then manifests in antigenic variations in the bacteria and parasites. This mechanism is responsible for antigenic variations seen in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia recurrentis, and Trypanosoma brucei. Transfer of DNA Between Bacterial Cells The genetic information can be transferred from one bacterium to another. There are three general methods for genetic exchange in bacteria: (a ) transformation, (b ) transduction, and (c ) conjugation.Transformation Transformation is a process of the transfer of DNA itself from one bacterium to another. This may occur either in nature or in a laboratory. In nature, DNA is released from a bacterium by lysis, which may be taken up by recipient bacterium that must be competent. This natural process of transfer of genetic material appears to play no role in disease. In laboratory condi-tions, DNA may be extracted from one type of bacterium and introduced into genetically different bacteria. The cell walls of bacteria in vitro are made more permeable for DNA uptake by using substances, such as calcium chloride. Griffith (1922) in his classical experiment on mice demon- strated that neither of the mice died when injected separately with a live, noncapsulated Pneumococcus (nonvirulent) and heat-killed, capsulated Pneumococcus (nonvirulent), but the mice died when they were injected with a mixture of both these strains. From the dead mice, he could isolate live, capsulated pneumococci, which were virulent. He demon-strated that some factor in heat-killed, capsulated pneumo-cocci had transferred the material for capsule synthesis in the noncapsulated strains of the bacteria, making them virulent (Fig. 7-1). McLeod and McCarthy in 1944 demonstrated that DNA extracted from encapsulated, smooth pneumococci could transform nonencapsulated, rough pneumococci into capsulated, smooth organisms. They demonstrated the transforming principle of DNA. The experimental use of transformation was the first experiment to reveal important information about DNA and was the first example of genetic exchange in bacteria. Another bacterium where transformation is observed is Haemophilus influenzae. Key Points When purified DNA is injected into the nucleus of a bacterial cell, the process is called as transfection. Transfection is fre- quently used in genetic engineering studies. Transduction The transfer of a portion of DNA from one bacterium to another mediated by a bacteriophage is known as transduc- tion. During replication of virus within the cell, a piece of bacterial DNA is incorporated into the bacteriophage and is carried into the recipient bacterium at the time of infection. The phage DNA within the recipient bacterial cell integrates into the cell DNA during a process called lysogenic conversion. The process of lysogenic conversion confers a new property to the bacterial cell; for example, by lysogenic conversion non-pathogenic bacteria can become pathogenic. Bacteriophages encode diphtheria toxin, botulinum toxin, cholera toxin, and erythrogenic toxin and can be transferred from one bacte-rium to another by transduction (Fig. 7-2). Transduction is of two types: MICROBIOLOGY 52Section I Chapter 7 Generalized transduction This occurs when a small fraction of the phage virions produced during lytic cycle are aberrant and contain a random fragment of the bacterial genome instead of phage DNA. Each individ-ual transducing phage carries a different set of closely linked genes, representing a small segment of the bacterial genome. Transduction mediated by populations of such phages is called generalized transduction. Each part of the bacterial genome has approximately the same probability of being transferred from donor to recipient bacteria. Generalized transduction involves any segment of the donor DNA at random. This occurs because the cell DNA is fragmented after such infection and pieces of same DNA, the same size as viral DNA, are incorporated into the bac-terial DNA. This occurs at a frequency of about 1 in every 1000 viruses. Generalized transduction may be complete or abortive: Complete transduction is characterized by production of stable recombinants that inherit donor genes and retain the ability to express them. Abortive transduction refers to the transient expression of one or more donor genes without formation of recombi-nant progeny. The donor DNA fragment does not replicate in abortive transduction, and only one bacterium contains the donor DNA fragment among the progeny of the origi-nal transductant. The donor gene products become progres-sively diluted in all other progeny after each generation of bacterial growth until the donor phenotype can no longer be expressed. On selective medium, abortive transductants produce minute colonies that can be distinguished easily from colonies of stable transductants. The frequency of abortive transduction is typically one to two times more than the frequency of generalized trans-duction. This indicates that most cells infected by generalized transducing phages do not produce recombinant progeny. Specialized transduction Specialized transduction results from lysogenization of the recipient bacterium by the specialized transducing phage and expression of the donor genes. Specialized transducing phages Living encapsulated bacteria injected into mouse Living nonencapsulated bacteria injected into mouseMouse died Mouse healthy Mouse healthyColonies of encapsulated bacteria were isolated from dead mouse Few colonies of nonencapsulated bacteria were isolated from mouse Heat-killed encapsulated bacteria injected into mouse Living nonencapsulated bacteria and heat-killed encapsulated bacteria injected into mouseMouse diedNo colonies were isolated from mouse Colonies of encapsulated bacteria were isolated from dead mouse1 1 1 12 2 2 23 3 3 3 FIG. 7-1.

A schematic diagram showing transmission of genetic material by bacteriophage-mediat ed transduction. are formed only when lysogenic donor bacteria enter the lytic cycle and release phage progeny. The specialized transducing phages are rare recombinants that lack part of the normal phage genome. They contain part of the bacterial chromosome present adjacent to the site of pro-phage attachment. Many specialized transducing phages are defective. They cannot complete the lytic cycle of phage growth in infected cells unless helper phages are present to provide missing phage functions. Specialized transduction differs from generalized transduc- tion in many ways. The former is mediated only by specific temperate phages and only a few specific donor genes can be transferred to recipient bacteria. Key Points Transduction is not only confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA but also to plasmids and episomes. Transformation involving transfer of plasmids from one bacterium to another by transduction is responsible for penicillin resistance in staphylococci. Transduction appears to be the most wide-spread mechanism of gene transfer among bacteria. This method also provides an excellent tool for the genetic map-ping of the bacteria. It can occur in many bacteria for which bacteriophages are known. It may occasionally occur in eukaryotic cells. Conjugation Conjugation is a process of transfer of DNA from the donor bacterium to the recipient bacterium during the mating of two bacterial cells. In conjugation, direct contact between the donor and recipient bacteria leads to formation of a cytoplasmic bridge between them and transfer of part or all of the donor genome to the recipient (Fig. 7-3). Conjugation takes place between two closely related species and occurs mostly in Gram-negative bacteria. Conjugation also occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. Donor ability of bacteria is determined by specific conju- gative plasmids called fertility (F /H11001) plasmids or sex plasmids. The F plasmid controls the mating process of bacteria. Pilus is the most important protein that forms the sex pilus or conjugation tube. The sex pilus produces a bridge between conjugating cells in Gram-negative bacteria. Mating occurs between the donor male bacterium carrying the F factor (F /H11001) and the recipient female bacterium that does not contain F fac-tor (F/H11002 ). It begins when the pilus of F/H11001 bacterium attaches to a receptor on the surface of a female (F/H11002 ) bacterium. The cells are then brought into direct contact by the link in the pilus. This is followed by an enzymatic cleavage of the F factor DNA in which one strand of bacterial DNA is transferred into the recipient cell through the conjugation bridge. The synthesis of the complementary strand to form a double-stranded F-factor plasmid in both the donor and recipient cells completes the process of conjugation. The recipient cell becomes F /H11001 male that is capable of transmitting the plasmid to other F/H11002 cells. High-frequency recombination (Hfr): Long length of DNA can be transferred by process of conjugation. Hfr strain is a type of F+ cells that have an F plasmid integrated into the bacterial DNA. Hence they acquire the capability of transferring the Sex pilus Conjugation process is initiated Separation of cell after the F plasmid transferInitiation of rolling circle replication by binding protein at 5/H11032 end Transfer of single stranded DNA and synthesis material by conjugation. Chap-07.indd 53 5/14/2012 11:47:28 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 54Section I Chapter 7 chromosome to another cell. A whole chromosome can be transferred if it is integrated with F plasmid. In this process, the single strand of DNA that enters the recipient F/H11002 cell contains a part of the F factor at one end, followed by the bacterial chromosome, and then by the remainder of the F factor. The bacterial genes adjacent to the leading piece of F factor are the most frequently transferred. The newly acquired DNA recombines with the recipient DNA and becomes an integral component of genetic material. The complete transfer of the bacterial DNA is usually completed in approximately 100 minutes. In matings between F+ and F bacteria, only the F plasmid is transferred with high efficiency to recipients. Chromosomal genes are transferred with very low efficiency, which is medi-ated by the spontaneous Hfr mutants in F /H11001 populations. In matings between Hfr and F/H11002 strains, the segment of the F plas-mid containing the tra region is transferred last, after the entire bacterial chromosome has been transferred. Most recombi-nants produced after matings between Hfr and F/H11002 cells fail to inherit the entire set of F-plasmid genes and are phenotypi-cally F/H11002. In matings between F/H11001 and F/H11002 strains, the F plasmid spreads rapidly throughout the bacterial population and most recombinants are F/H11001. Conjugation also occurs in Gram-positive bacteria. Gram- positive donor bacteria produce adhesions that cause them to aggregate with recipient cells, but sex pili are not involved. In some Streptococcus spp., recipient bacteria produce extracellular sex pheromones that facilitate conjugation. Table 7-1 shows a comparison of transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Key Points Transfer of plasmids during conjugation is responsible for the spread of multiple drug resistance among bacteria. The plasmid responsible for drug resistance consists of two components, namely, RTF and a resistance determinant (r) for each of the sev-eral drugs. Transferable drug resistance occurs widely among pathogenic as well as commensal bacteria of humans and ani-mals. Plasmid is also responsible for production of colicins, the antibiotic-like substances lethal to other Gram-negative bacteria. The plasmid that encodes for production of colicins is known as col factor and is also transferred by conjugation. Recombination After the DNA is transferred from one donor bacterium to the recipient through transformation, transduction, or conjuga-tion, it combines with the chromosome of the bacterium by a process called recombination. Recombination is of two types: homologous and nonho- mologous. Homologous recombination takes place between two pieces of DNA showing extensive homologous regions. This results in pairing up and exchange of pieces by the pro-cesses of breakage and reunion. The nonhomologous recom-bination takes place between two pieces of DNA showing little or no homology.Methods of transferMechanism Nature of DNA transferred Transformation Recipient cell uptake of free DNA released into the environmentAny gene Transduction Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another by bacteriophageAny gene in generalized transduction; only selected genes in specialized transduction Conjugation Transfer of DNA from one living bacterium to another through the sex pilusChromosomal or plasmid DNATABLE AMGenetic Engineeringand Molecular Methods 8 Introduction The deliberate modification of an organism's genetic information by directly changing its nucleic acid genome is called genetic engineering and is achieved by a group of meth- ods known as recombinant DNA technology. DNA: An Amazing Molecule The structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) provides a com-plex code that encodes for synthesis of proteins. The DNA as a molecule exhibits many intriguing features. One useful prop-erty of DNA is that it readily anneals, meaning that it changes its binding properties in response to heating and cooling. Exposure to temperatures just below boiling (90-95\u00b0C) causes DNA to become temporarily denatured. When heat breaks open the hydrogen bonds that keep the double helix together, it sep-arates longitudinally into two strands. Each strand displays its nucleotide code so that the DNA in this form can be subjected to tests or replicated. When heating is followed by gradual cooling, two single DNA strands rejoin (renature) by hydrogen bonds at complementary sites. Annealing is a necessary feature of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid probes described later. Genetic Engineering Genetic engineering is the application of science to social needs. In recent years, engineering based on bacterial genetics has transformed biology. Specified DNA fragments can be isolated and amplified, and their genes can be expressed at high levels. The nucleotide specificity, required for cleavage by restriction enzymes, allows fragments containing genes or parts of genes to be covalently bound to plasmids (vectors) that can then be inserted into bacterial hosts. Bacterial colonies or clones carrying specified genes are iden- tified by hybridization of DNA or RNA with chemical or radio- chemical probes. Alternatively, protein products encoded by the genes are recognized either by enzyme activity or by immuno-logic techniques. Thus, genetic engineering techniques are used to isolate virtually any gene with a biochemically recognizable property.Preparation of DNA Fragments with Restriction Enzymes The genetic diversity of bacteria is reflected in their remarkable range of restriction enzymes, which possess remarkable selectivity that allows them to recognize specific regions of DNA for cleav-age. DNA sequences recognized by restriction enzymes are pre-dominantly palindromes (inverted sequence repetitions). GAATTC is a typical sequence palindrome, recognized by the frequently used restriction enzyme EcoRI. The inverted repetition, inherent in the complementarity of the G-C and A-T base pairs, results in the 5/H11032 sequence TTC being reflected as AAG in the 3/H11032 strand. Most restriction enzymes recognize 4, 6, or 8 base sequences; however, other restriction enzymes recognize 10, 11, 12, or 15 base sequences. Restriction enzymes that recognize 8 bases produce fragments with a typical size of 64,000 bp and are useful for anal-ysis of large genetic regions. Restriction enzymes that recognize more than 10 bases are useful for construction of a physical map and for molecular typing by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Physical Separation of Differently Sized DNA Fragments Much of the simplicity underlying genetic engineering techniques lies in the fact that gel electrophoresis permits DNA fragments to be separated on the basis of size. The smaller the fragment, the more rapid the migration. Overall rate of migra-tion and optimal range of size for separation are determined by the chemical nature of the gel and by the degree of its cross-linking. Highly cross-linked gels optimize the separation of small DNA fragments. The dye ethidium bromide forms a brightly fluorescent color as it binds to DNA, and so small amounts of separated DNA fragments can be photographed on gels. Specific DNA fragments can be recognized by probes containing complementary sequences. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis allows the separation of DNA fragments containing up to 100,000 bp (100 kilobase pairs, or kbp). Characterization of such large fragments has allowed construction of a physical map for the chromosomes from several bacterial species. Enzymes for Dicing, Splicing, and Reversing Nucleic Acids Restriction endonucleases: The polynucleotide strands of DNA can also be clipped crosswise at selected positions by Chap-08.indd 55 5/14/2012 11:46:54 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 56Section I Chapter 8means of enzymes called restriction endonucleases. These enzymes recognize foreign DNA and are capable of digesting or hydrolyzing DNA bonds. Presence of enzyme in the bacterial cell protects bacteria against the incompatible DNA of bacte-riophages or plasmids. In a laboratory, restriction endonuclease enzymes can be used to cleave DNA at desired sites and are a must for the techniques of recombinant DNA technology. So far, hundreds of restric-tion endonucleases have been discovered in bacteria. Each type has a known sequence of 4-10 bp as its target, so sites of cutting can be finely controlled. Endonucleases are named by combin-ing the first letter of the bacterial genus, the first two letters of the species, and the endonuclease number. For example, EcoRI is the first endonuclease found in Escherichia coli and HindIII is the third endonuclease discovered in Haemophilus influenzae typed.Restriction fragment length polymorphisms: The pieces of DNA produced by restriction endonucleases are termed restric- tion fragments. Because genomes of members of the same spe- cies can vary in the cutting pattern by specific endonucleases, it is possible to detect genetic differences by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Hundreds of cleavage sites that produce RFLPs are dis- tributed throughout genomes. Because RFLPs serve as a type of genetic marker, they can help locate specific sites along a DNA strand. The RFLPs are thus useful in preparation of gene maps and DNA profiles, and also in analysis of genetic relationships.Ligase: It is an enzyme necessary to seal the sticky ends together by rejoining the phosphate-sugar bonds cut by endonucleases. Its main application is in final splicing of genes into plasmids and chromosomes.Reverse transcriptase: It is an enzyme, best known for its role in the replication of the AIDS virus and other retroviruses. This enzyme is used by geneticists as a valuable tool for converting RNA into DNA.Complementary DNA: The copies called complementary DNA, or cDNA, can be made from messenger, transfer, ribosomal, and other forms of RNA. The technique provides a valuable means of synthesizing eukaryotic genes from mRNA transcripts. The advantage is that the synthesized gene will be free of the inter-vening sequences (introns) that can complicate the management of eukaryotic genes in genetic engineering. Complementary DNA can also be used to analyze the nucleotide sequence of RNAs, such as those found in ribosomes and transfer RNAs. Methods Used to Size, Synthesize, and Sequence DNA The relative sizes of nucleic acids are usually known by the number of base pairs or nucleotides they contain. For example, the palindromic sequences recognized by endonucleases are usually 4-10 bp in length. An average gene in E. coli is approxi- mately 1300 bp, or 1.3 kilobases (kb), and its entire genome is approximately 4.7 million base pairs (Mb). The Epstein-Barr virus, cause of infectious mononucleosis, has a gene of 172 kb. Humans have approximately 3.5 billion base pairs (Bbp) arrayed along 46 chromosomes. Oligonucleotides are very short pieces of DNA or RNA. They vary in length from 2 to 200 bp, although the most common ones are about 20-30 bp. They can be isolated from cells or prepared tailor-made by a DNA synthesizer that limits the length to about 200 nucleotides. Hybridization probes are used routinely in the cloning of DNA. The amino acid sequence of a protein is used to deduce the DNA sequence from which a probe may be constructed and employed to detect a bacterial colony containing the cloned gene. cDNA, encoded by mRNA, is used to detect the gene that encodes the mRNA. Types of hybridization Hybridization is of the following types: Northern blot: Hybridization of DNA to RNA is known as Northern blot, which provides quantitative information about RNA synthesis. Southern blot: Hybridization of DNA to DNA is known as Southern blot. This method is useful to detect specific DNA sequences in restriction fragments separated on gels. These blots can be used to detect overlapping restriction fragments. Western blot: It is a technique used for detection of genes, in which antibodies are used to detect cloned genes by bind-ing to their protein products. Cloning of these fragments makes it possible to isolate flank-ing regions of DNA by a technique known as chromosomal walking. DNA sequencing DNA sequencing shows gene structure that helps research workers to find out the structure of gene products. Key Points DNA sequencing has many applications as follows: Information obtained by DNA sequencing makes it possible to understand or alter the function of genes. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates regulatory regions that control gene expression and genetic \"hot spots\" particularly susceptible to mutation. Comparison of DNA sequences shows evolutionary relationships that provide a framework for definite classifi-cation of microorganisms including viruses. Comparison of DNA sequences facilitates identification of conserved regions, which are useful for development of specific hybridization probes to detect microorganisms including viruses in clinical samples. Maxam-Gilbert technique and Sanger (dideoxy termination) method are two methods used routinely for DNA sequence determination. Maxam-Gilbert technique depends on the relative chemical liability of different nucleotide bonds, whereas the Sanger method interrupts elongation of DNA sequences by 56 5/14/2012 11:46:55 AMGENETIC ENGINEERING AND MOLECULAR METHODS 57Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 8Shotgunning: The study of biology has been revolutionized by the development of technology that allows sequencing and analysis of entire genomes ranging from viruses to unicellular prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms to humans. This has been facilitated by use of the procedure known as shotgunning. In this procedure, the DNA is broken into random smaller fragments to create a random fragment library. Nucleic Acid Probes Nucleic acid probes are segments of DNA and RNA labeled with radioisotopes or enzymes that can hybridize to com-plementary nucleic acids with high degree of specificity. Hybridization probes have practical value, because they can detect specific nucleotide sequences in unknown samples. The probes carry reporter molecules, such as radioactive labels, which are isotopes that emit radiation, or luminescent labels, which give off visible light. Reactions can be revealed by placing photographic film in contact with the test reaction. Fluorescent probes contain dyes that can be visualized with ultraviolet light. Probes can be used in a broad range of ana-lytic procedures. Two different nucleic acids can hybridize by uniting at their complementary sites. All different combinations are possible: single-stranded DNA can unite with other single-stranded DNA or RNA, and RNA can hybridize with other RNA. This property forms the basis of specially formulated oligonucle-otide tracers called gene probes.Key Points Applications of DNA Probes DNA probes are nonamplified methods; they only detect DNA in specimens but without any amplification of the same (Fig. 8-1). DNA probes have many applications as follows: A number of DNA probes have been developed for identi-fication of culture isolates and for various uses in clinical microbiology by (a) direct detection of microbes in clini-cal specimens and (b) by identification of organisms after isolation of culture (Box 8-1). Some regions of human DNA exhibit substantial vari-ability in the distribution of restriction sites. This vari-ability is termed restriction fragment length polymorphism. Oligonucleotide probes that hybridize with RFLP DNA fragments can be used to trace DNA from a small sample to its human donor. Thus, the technique is valuable to foren-sic science. Applications of RFLP to medicine include identification of genetic regions that are closely linked to human genes with dysfunctions coupled to genetic disease. This information will be a valuable aid in genetic counseling. Polymerase Chain Reaction In 1983, Kary Mullis developed a new technique that made it possible to synthesize large quantities of a DNA fragment without cloning it. This technique is called polymerase chain Shigella colonies on growth medium Shigella fragment DNA cloned in E. coli Cloned DNA fragment marked with fluorescent dye and separated into single strands, forming DNA probesDNA is denatured tosingle strand of DNA DNA probes are added tothe DNA stool specimens DNA probes hybridize with Shigella DNA indicate presence 4 FIG. 8-1.

Chap-08.indd 57 5/14/2012 11:46:55 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 58Section I Chapter 8reaction (PCR) and has great practical importance and impact on biotechnology. By this technique, large quantities of a particular DNA sequence can be prepared. In PCR, oligonucleotide sequences identical to those flanking the targeted sequence are first synthesized. These synthetic oligonucleotides are usually about 20 nucleotides long and serve as primers for DNA synthesis. Pieces ranging in size from less than 100 bp to several 1000 bp in length can be amplified, and only 10-100 pmol primer is required. The concentration of target DNA can be as low as 10-15 /H9262L. The reaction mix for PCR contains (a) the target DNA (b) a very large excess of the desired primers, ( c) a thermostable DNA polymerase, and (d ) four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Only DNA polymerases that are able to function at the high temperatures can be employed in the PCR technique. Taq poly-merase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus and the Vent polymerase from Thermococcus litoralis are the two popu- lar enzymes used in the PCR. The PCR cycle takes place in three steps as follows (Fig. 8-2): Step 1: The target DNA containing the sequence to be ampli-fied is heat denatured to separate its complementary strands. Normally the target DNA is between 100 and 5000 bp in length. Step 2: The temperature is lowered so that the primers can anneal to the DNA on both sides of the target sequence. Because the primers are present in excess, the targeted DNA strands normally anneal to the primers rather than to each other. Step 3: DNA polymerase extends the primers and synthe-sizes copies of the target DNA sequence using the deoxyri-bonucleoside triphosphates. At the end of one cycle, the targeted sequences on both strands are copied. When the three-step cycle is repeated, the four strands from the first cycle are copied to produce eight fragments. The third cycle yields 16 products. Theoretically, 20 cycles will produce about one million copies of the target DNA sequence, and 30 cycles yield around one billion copies. The PCR technique has now been automated and is carried out through a specially designed machine called thermocy-cler. Currently, a thermocycler or PCR machine can carry out 25 cycles and amplify DNA 10 5 times in as little as 57 minutes. During a typical cycle, the DNA is denatured at 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds; then the primers are annealed and extended (steps 2 and 3) at 68\u00b0C for 60 seconds. PCR technology is improving continually and undergoing many changes as follows: 1. Nowadays, RNA can be efficiently used in PCR proce-dures. The Tth DNA polymerase, a recombinant Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase, will transcribe RNA to DNA and then amplify the DNA . Cellular RNAs and RNA viruses may be studied even when the RNA is present in very small amounts (as few as 100 copies can be transcribed and amplified). 2. Also, PCR can quantitate DNA products without the use of iso topes. This allo ws one to find the initial amount of target DNA in less than an hour using automated equip-ment. Quantitative PCR is quite valuable in virology and gene expression studies. 3. As mentioned earlier, the target DNA to be amplified is normally less than about 5000 bp in length. A long PCR techniq ue has been developed that will amplify sequences up to 42 kilo bases long. It depends on the use of error- correcting polymerases because Taq polymerase is is another modif ication of PCR in which two or more target sequences can be demonstrated simultane-ously in a single specimen at the same time. This method uses two or more primer sets designed for amplification of different targets. Multiplex is now increasingly evaluated for simultaneous demonstration of two or more patho-gens in synthesis (elongation) Approximately 30 repetitive cycles DNA products (amplicons) up to 109 fold amplificationPrimer 1 C GCAG TCCGTCAGG FIG. 8-2.

Real-time PCR is the most recent development. It is so named, because the PCR amplicons can be detected in real time. In fact, \"real time\" refers to the detection of amplicons after each PCR cycle. Several commercial instruments are available that combine PCR amplification of target DNA with detection of amplicons in the same closed vessel. Probe detection formats involve detecting fluorophores. Results are semiquantitative and can be obtained in considerably less time than it takes to perform a conven-tional PCR assay. Key Points Applications of PCR The PCR and other molecular techniques have already proven exceptionally valuable in many areas of molecular biology, medicine, and biotechnology. These methods are useful to: Amplify very small quantities of a specific DNA and provide sufficient material for accurately sequencing the fragment or cloning it by standard techniques. Detect previously unrecognized or uncultivable micro -organisms. Detect the genes responsible for drug resistance. They supplement conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the detection of methicillin resistance in staphylococci, rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis, etc. Predict and monitor response of individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or HIV to antiviral therapy. Provide useful information that may predict progres-sion of the disease. Determination of HIV-1 viral load as a predictor of progression to AIDS is an example of such use. Diagnose AIDS, Lyme disease, chlamydia, tuberculosis, hepatitis, the human papilloma virus, and other infectious agents. Detect genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, phenyl-ketonuria, and muscular dystrophy. Recombinant DNA Technology In recombinant DNA technology, first, the DNA responsible for a particular phenotype is identified and isolated. Once purified, the gene or genes are fused with other pieces of DNA to form recombinant DNA molecules. These are prop-agated (gene cloning) by insertion into an organism that need not even be in the same kingdom as the original gene donor. Cloning Vectors and Hosts A good recombinant vector has two indispensable qualities: it must be capable of carrying a significant piece of the donor DNA and it must be readily accepted by the cloning host. Cloning vectors Cloned vectors include: (a) plasmids, (b) bacteriophages, and (c) hybrid vectors. Plasmids are excellent vectors because they are small, well characterized, easy to manipulate, and they can be trans-ferred into appropriate host cells through transformation. E. coli plasmid carries genetic markers for resistance to antibiotics, although it is restricted by the relatively small amount of foreign DNA it can accept. Bacteriophages are also good vectors because they have natural ability to inject DNA into bacterial hosts through transduction. The Charon2 phage is a modified phage vector that lacks a large part of its genome; hence it can carry a fairly large segment of foreign DNA. Hybrid vectors have been developed by splicing two dif- ferent vectors together. A cosmid is an example of a hybrid vector that combines a plasmid and a phage and is capable of carrying relatively large genomic sequences. A hybrid E. coli-yeast vector can be inserted in both bacterial and yeast cloning hosts. Cloning hosts E. coli is the traditional cloning host that is still used in the majority of experiments. This is because this bacterium was the original recombinant host and the protocols using it are well established, relatively easy, and reliable. Hundreds of specialized cloning vectors have been developed for it. The main disadvan-tage with E. coli is its lack of versatility in correctly expressing eukaryotic genes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is another alternative host used for certain industrial processes and research. This host being eukaryotic already possesses mechanisms for processing and modifying eukaryotic gene products. Certain techniques may also employ different bacteria (Bacillus subtilis), animal cell culture, and even live animals and plants to serve as cloning hosts. Biological Products of Recombinant DNA Technology Recombinant DNA technology is used by pharmaceutical companies to manufacture medicines that cannot be manu-factured by any other means. Diseases, such as diabetes and dwarfism, caused by lack of an essential hormone are now being treated by replacing the genes of missing hormone. Porcine and bovine insulin were once the only forms avail-able to treat diabetes, even though such animal products used to cause allergic reactions in certain sensitive individuals. In contrast, dwarfism that cannot be treated with animal growth hormones was treated only with human growth hormone (HGH) obtained from the pituitaries of cadavers. At one time, not enough HGH was available to treat thousands of children in need. However, now the scenario is changed by advent of recombinant HGH. Recombinant technology has changed the outcome of these and many other conditions by enabling large-scale manufacture of lifesaving hormones and enzymes of human origin. Chap-08.indd 59 5/14/2012 11:46:55 AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 60Section I Chapter 8Genetically Modified Organisms The process of artificially introducing foreign genes into organisms is termed transfection, and the recombinant organ-isms produced in this way are called transgenic or genetically modified organisms. Foreign genes have been inserted into a variety of microbes, plants, and animals through recombinant DNA techniques developed especially for them. Transgenic \"designer\" organ-isms are available for a variety of biotechnological applications. Because they are unique life forms that would never have other-wise occurred, they can be patented. Gene Therapy Gene therapy is a technique for replacing a faulty gene with a normal one in individuals with fatal or extremely debilitating genetic diseases. The inherent benefit of this therapy is to per-manently cure the physiological dysfunction by repairing the genetic defect.There are two strategies for this therapy: the ex vivo therapy and the in vivo therapy. In ex vivo therapy, the normal gene is cloned in vectors, such as retroviruses (e.g., mouse leukemia virus) or adenoviruses that are infectious but relatively harm-less. Tissues removed from the patient are incubated with these genetically modified viruses to transfect them with the normal gene. The transfected cells are then reintroduced into patient's body by transfusion. In contrast, the in vivo type of therapy does not have the intermediate step of incubating excised patient tis-sue. Instead, the naked DNA or a virus vector is directly intro-duced into the patient's tissues. The first gene therapy experiment in humans was started in 1990 by researchers at the National Institutes of Health, USA. The subject was a 4-year-old girl suffering from a severe immu-nodeficiency disease caused by the lack of enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). She was transfused with her own blood cells that had been engineered to contain a functional ADA gene. Later, other children were given the same type of therapy. So far, the children have shown remarkable improvement and continue to be healthy, but the treatment is not permanent and must be repeated. Proper scientific controlled trials are required before induction of it as a routine clinical practice. Chap-08.indd 60 5/14/2012 11:46:55 AMAntimicrobial Agents: Therapy and Resistance 9 Introduction Any chemical used in treatment, relief, or prophylaxis of disease is defined as a chemotherapeutic drug or agent. When chemothe ra-peutic drugs are given as a means to control infection, the practice is termed antimicrobial chemotherapy . Antimicrobial drugs (also termed anti-infective drugs) are a special class of compounds capable even in high dilutions of destroying or inhibiting micro-organisms. The origin of modern antimicrobial drugs is varied. The antibiotics are substances produced by the natural meta- bolic processes of some microorganisms that can inhibit or destroy other microorganisms. Synthetic antimicrobial drugs are derived in laboratory from dyes or other organic compounds through chemical reactions. Although division into these two categories has been traditional, they tend to overlap, because most antibiotics, termed semisynthetic antibiotics , are now chemi- cally altered in laboratory. The current trend is to use the term antimicrobic for all antimicrobial drugs, regardless of origin Antimicrobial drugs vary in their spectrum of activities. They may be broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum or extended- spectrum antibiotics are active against a wider range of different microbes. For example, tetra-cyclines are active against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, and even protozoa. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are effective against one or very few microbes. For example, vancomycin is active against certain Gram-positive bacteria (such as staphylococci and enterococci) or griseofulvin, which is used only against fungal skin infections. Mechanisms of Action of Antimicrobial Drugs Antimicrobial drugs may be bactericidal or bacteriostatic. A bactericidal drug kills bacteria, whereas a bacteriostatic drug inhibits the growth of bacteria, but does not kill them. Bactericidal drugs are very much useful in ( a) life- threatening situations, (b) endocarditis, ( c) patients with low polymor- phonuclear count (below 500//H9262 L), and (d) conditions in which bacteriostatic drugs do not cause a cure. The bacteriostatic drugs depend on the host defense mecha-nisms, such as phagocytes to kill the bacteria. Hence, these drugs are not used when the patient has too few neutrophils.Antibiotics act against bacteria by the following mechanisms: 1. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis 2. Inhibition of protein synthesis 3. Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis 4. Alteration of cell membrane function Inhibition of Cell Wall Synthesis Penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin are the antibiot-ics that act against bacteria by interfering with their cell wall synthesis. Penicillins and cephalosporins are called /H9252-lactam antibiotics because they possess an intact /H9252-lactam ring essen-tial for antimicrobial activity. Penicillins The penicillins are called /H9252 -lactam antibiotics because they have a common chemical nucleus (6-aminopenicillanic acid) that contains a /H9252 -lactam ring. They are bactericidal antibiotics that act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. They act primarily against Gram-positive organisms. Other penicillins, such as ampicillin, amoxicillin, both Gram-positive organisms. Penicillins kill bacteria by the following mechanisms: Penicillins kill bacteria during their growing stage and are more active against replicating bacteria during the log phase than the lag phase of the bacterial growth curve. The intact peptidoglycan in the cell wall of the bacteria has chains of N-acetyl muramic acid (NAM) and N -acetyl glucosamine (NAG) glycans cross-linked by peptide bridges. Penicillins and cephalosporins act by inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), also known as transpeptidases, that link the cross-bridges between NAMs, thereby, greatly weakening the cell wall meshwork. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an example of bacteria that show resistance against penicillins due to mutations that occur in the genes encoding PBPs. Cephalosporins Cephalosporins like penicillins are /H9252 -lactam differ from penicillins in having 7-amino- cephalosporanic acid instead of 6-aminopenicillanic acid in their structure. They exhibit bactericidal activity similar to that of penicillin. They are effective against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. Chap-09.indd 61 5/14/2012 12:32:59 PMSection cephalosporins are against Gram-positive cocci. Second-, fourth-generation cephalosporins are active primarily against Gram-negative bacilli. The important cephalosporins are listed in Table 9-1. Carbapenems (such as imipenem) and monobactams (such as aztreonam) are other examples of /H9252 -lactam antibiotics, but these are structurally different from penicillins and cephalosporins. Vancomycin Vancomycin is a glycopeptide, but its mode of action is very similar to that of /H9252-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. It kills bacteria by inhibiting their cell wall syn-thesis. Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic and is used: Most widely against Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. infections; Orally for treatment of antibiotics-associated colitis; and Also for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Teicoplanin Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic extracted from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, with a similar spectrum of activity to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Teicoplanin is used in: Prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA and Enterococcus faecalis. Treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium dif-ficile-associated diarrhea, with comparable efficacy with van-comycin. Its strength is considered to be due to the length of the hydrocarbon chain. Inhibition of Protein Synthesis Bacteria have 30S and 50S ribosomal units, whereas mam-malian cells have 80S ribosomes. The subunits of each type of ribosome, their chemical composition, and their functional specificities are sufficiently different, which explains why these antimicrobial drugs can inhibit protein synthesis in bacte-rial ribosomes without having a major effect on mammalian ribosomes. Aminoglycosides and tetracyclines act at the level of 30S ribosomal subunits, whereas erythromycins, chloramphenicol, and clindamycins act 50S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 9-1). Aminoglycosides Aminoglycosides are include streptomy-cin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and neomycin, which are increasingly used in different clinical conditions. They kill bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis. They do so by binding to the 30S subunit ribosome, which blocks the initiation com-plex, leading to no formation of peptide bonds or polysomes. They act mostly against Gram-negative bacteria. Tetracyclines Tetracyclines are a family of drugs that include dimethylchlo-rotetracyclines, doxycycline, and rolitetracycline. They are bacteriostatic drugs. They act by inhibiting protein synthesis of the bacteria by blocking the binding of aminoacyl t-RNA to the 30S ribosomal subunits. Therefore, they prevent introduction of new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain. The action is usually inhibitory and reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. They are variably effective in infections caused by both cocci and bacilli. They are also highly effective against rickettsial and chlamydial infections. Doxycycline, dimethylchlorotetra-cycline, a macrolide ring to which sug-ars are attached. They are bacteriostatic antibiotics. They act by inhibiting protein synthesis of the bacteria by blocking the release of the t-RNA after it has transferred its amino acids to the growing polypeptide. Erythromycin is effective of cephalosporins used in clinical practice First generation Second generation Third generation Fourth generation THERAPY AND III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 9 Chloramphenicol Chloramphenicol is mainly a bacteriostatic agent, and growth of bacteria resumes when the drug is withdrawn. It acts by bind-ing to the 50S subunit of the ribosome and blocking peptidyl transferase, the enzyme that delivers the amino acid to the grow-ing polypeptide, resulting in the inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. Chloramphenicol is used less frequently nowadays. Clindamycin The mode of action of clindamycin is similar to that of eryth-romycin. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by blocking the release of t-RNA after it has transferred its amino acids to the growing polypeptide. Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis Sulfonamides, trimethoprim, quinolones, and rifampin are examples of drugs that act by inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim Sulfonamides and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis inhibiting synthesis. Sulfonamides are structural analogs of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Due to structural similarity to PABA, sulfonamide competes with the latter during bacterial metabolism. Sulfonamides enter into the reaction in place of PABA and compete for the active center of the enzyme. As a result, nonfunctional analogs of folic acid are formed, preventing further growth of the bacterial cell. The inhibitory action of sulfonamides on bacterial growth can be counteracted by an excess of PABA in the environment (competitive inhibi-tion). Many other bacteria, however, synthesize folic acid, as mentioned above, and consequently are susceptible to action by sulfonamides. Sulfonamides are bacteriostatic drugs effective against a variety and Gram-positive bacteria.Trimethoprim (3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylpyrimidine) is a bac- teriostatic drug active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The compound inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolic acid reductase 50,000 times more efficiently in bacteria than in mammalian cells. This enzyme reduces dihydrofolic to tetrahydrofolic acid, leading to decreased syn-thesis of purines and ultimately of DNA. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim inhibit the synthesis of tet- rahydrofolic acid, the main donor of the methyl groups that are essential to synthesize adenine, guanine, and cytosine. Key Points Sulfonamides and trimethoprim, each can be used alone to inhibit bacterial growth. If used together, they produce sequential blocking, result-ing in a marked enhancement (synergism) of activity. Such mixtures of sulfonamide (five parts) plus trimethoprim (one part) have been used in the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia, malaria, shigella enteritis, systemic salmonella infections, urinary tract infections, and many others. Quinolones Quinolones are synthetic analogs of nalidixic acid. They are a fam-ily of drugs that include ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin. They are bactericidal and act by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis by blocking DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase is the enzyme that unwinds DNA strands, so they can be replicated. Quinolones are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Rifampin Rifampin inhibits bacterial growth by binding strongly to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of bacteria. Thus, it inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis. The mechanism of rifampin action on viruses is different. It blocks a late stage in the assembly of poxviruses.FIG. 9-1. Schematic diagram showing various mechanisms of actions 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY I Chapter 9Alteration of Cell Membrane Function The cytoplasm of all living cells is surrounded by the cytoplas-mic membrane, which serves as a selective permeability bar-rier. The cytoplasmic membrane carries out active transport functions, and thus controls the internal composition of the cell. If the functional integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane is disrupted, macromolecules and ions escape from the cell, and cell damage or death ensues. The cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and fungi has a structure different from that of animal cells and can be more readily disrupted by certain agents. Consequently, selective chemotherapy is possible. Antifungal drugs act by altering the cell membrane function of the fungi. They show selective toxicity because cell membrane of the fungi contains ergosterol, while human cell membrane has cholesterol. Bacteria with the exception of Mycoplasma do not have sterols in their cell membranes, hence are resistant to action of these drugs. Key Points Amphotericin B and azoles are the frequently used antifun-gal drugs. Amphotericin B acts against fungi by disrupting the cell membrane by binding at the site of ergosterol in the membrane. Azoles (such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itra-conazole, and clotrimazole) inhibit synthesis of ergosterol, hence are toxic to fungi. Polymyxin B is an antibiotic primarily used for resistant Gram-negative infections. It is derived from the bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. Polymyxin B is a mixture of two closely related compounds\u2014polymyxin B1 and polymyxin B2. It has a bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxins bind to the cell membrane and alter its structure, making it more permeable. The resulting water uptake leads to cell death. They are cationic, basic proteins that act like detergents (surfactants). Side-effects include neurotoxicity and acute renal tubular necrosis. It is commonly used in the topical first-aid preparation. Cellular target sites of antimicrobial drugs are listed in Table 9-2.Resistance to Antimicrobial Drugs Bacterial resistance to drugs is a condition in which the bacte-ria that were earlier susceptible to antibiotics develop resistance against the same antibiotics and are not susceptible to the action of these antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance among bacte-ria is a major concern in the treatment of a patient. Emergence of antibiotic resistance to the old as well as new antibiotics by bacteria is posing a major challenge in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is seen more commonly in hospital- acquired infections than in community-acquired infections. The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more commonly seen in hospital environment due to widespread use of antibiotics in hospitals that select for these bacteria. These hospital strains of bacteria are characterized by developing resistance to multiple antibiotics at the same time. Common examples of such strains of bacteria showing drug resistance include hospital strains of S. aureus and Gram-negative enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance to multiple antibiot-ics is mediated by plasmid-carrying several genes that encode enzymes responsible for the resistance. Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance There are many different mechanisms by which microorganisms might exhibit resistance to drugs (Fig. 9-2). These are ( a) produc- tion of enzymes, (b ) production of altered enzymes, (c ) synthesis of modified targets, (d ) alteration of permeability of cell wall, (e ) alteration of metabolic pathways, and (f ) efflux pump as follows: Production of enzymes Bacteria produce enzymes that inactivate antibiotics. For example, penicillin-resistant staphylococci produce an enzyme /H9252-lactamase that destroys the penicillins and cephalosporins by splitting the /H9252-lactam ring of the drug. Gram-negative bacteria resistant to aminoglycosides, mediated by a plasmid, produce adenylating, phosphorylating, or acetylating enzymes that destroy the drug. Production of altered enzymes Certain microorganisms develop an altered enzyme that can still perform its metabolic function, but is much less affected by the drug. For example, in trimethoprim-resistant bacteria, the dihydrofolic acid reductase is inhibited far less efficiently than in trimethoprim-susceptible bacteria. Synthesis of modified targets Certain bacteria produce modified targets against which the antibiotic has no effect. For example, a methylated 23S ribo-somal RNA can result in resistance to erythromycin, and a mutant protein in the 50S ribosomal subunits can result in resistance to streptomycin. Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and enterococci is caused by the loss or alteration of PBPs.TABLE 9-2 Cellular target sites of antibiotics Drug Target site Mechanism of action /H9252-lactams Cell wall Bactericidal, interfere with cross- linking of cell peptidoglycan molecules fusidic acid, tetracyclineRibosomes Bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal, interfere with translocation of t-RNA, thus inhibiting protein synthesis Polyenes Cytoplasmic membraneBacteriostatic, disrupt yeast cell membrane Metronidazole, idoxuridine, 12:33:00 PMANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS: THERAPY AND RESISTANCE 65Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 9 Alteration of permeability of cell wall Some bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic by changing their permeability to the drug in such a way that an effective intra-cellular concentration of the antibiotic is not achieved inside the bacterial cell. For example, P. aeruginosa develops resistance against tetracyclines by changing its porins that can reduce the amount of tetracycline entering the bacteria, thereby develop-ing resistance to the antibiotics. Resistance to polymyxins is also associated with a change in permeability to the drugs. Streptococci have a natural perme-ability barrier to aminoglycosides. This can be partly overcome by the simultaneous presence of a cell wall-active drug, e.g., penicillin. Alteration of metabolic pathways Bacteria may develop resistance by altering metabolic pathway that bypasses the reaction inhibited by the drug. For example, certain sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require extracel-lular PABA but, like mammalian cells, can utilize preformed folic acid. Efflux pumps Efflux pumps have been found to be responsible for conferring resistance to many groups of antibiotics including aminogly-cosides, quinolones, etc. The major family of bacterial efflux pumps include ABC (ATP-binding cassette) multidrug efflux pump, multidrug resistance and pumps, major facilitator superfamily efflux (MFSE) pumps, etc. Basis of Resistance Resistance by bacteria against antibiotic may be classified as: 1. Nongenetic basis 2. Genetic basisNongenetic Basis of Resistance Nongenetic basis of resistance plays a less important role in the development of drug resistance: 1. Certain bacteria under ordinary circumstances are usually killed by penicillins. But these bacteria, if lose their cell wall and become protoplast, become nonsuscep tible to the action of cell wall-acting drug such as penicillins. 2. In certain conditions, such as in the abscess cavity, bacteria can be walled off, which prev ents drugs to penetrate effec- tively into bacteria. Surgical drainage of pus, however, makes these bacteria again susceptible to the action of antibiotics. 3. Presence of foreign bodies (such as surgical implants and cath-eters) and pene tration injury caused by splinters and sharpen- ers make successful antibiotic treatment more difficult. 4. Nonreplicating bacteria in their resting stage are less sensi-tive to the action of cell wall inhibitors such as penicillin and cephalosporins. This is par ticularly true for certain bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis that remains in resting stage in tissues for many years, during which it is insensitive to drugs. However, when these bacteria begin to multiply, they become susceptible to antibiotics. Genetic Basis of Drug Resistance The genetic basis of drug resistance, mediated by genetic change in bacteria, is most important in the development of drug resistance in bacteria. This is of three types as follows: (a) chromosome-mediated resistance, (b) plasmid-mediated resistance, and (c) transposons-mediated resistance. Chromosome-mediated resistance Chromosome-mediated resistance occurs as a result of spon-taneous mutation. This is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for either the target of drug or the transport system in the membrane of the cell wall, which controls the entry of drugs into cells. The frequency of chromosomal mutation is much less than the plasmid-mediated resistance. It varies between 10 /H110027 and 10/H110029.Antibiotic sensitive cells Antibiotic resistant cells Alteration of target Inactivation of antibiotic Decreased permeabilityAntibiotic target Altered targetAntibiotic Inactivatedantibiotic FIG. 9-2.

Chap-09.indd 65 5/14/2012 12:33:00 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 66Section I Chapter 9Key Points Mutational resistance in M. tuberculosis is of much importance in the treatment of tuberculosis: Treatment of tuberculosis with two or more antitubercu-lar drugs is carried out to prevent emergence of multidrug resistance in the tuberculosis. This is based on the principle that it is most unlikely that the bacterium, M. tuberculosis, becomes concurrently resis-tant to all the antibiotics given simultaneously. There is less likely resistant mutation because on treatment with antitubercular drugs, a mutant of M. tuberculosis resistant to one drug, if appears, will be destroyed by the other drug. Plasmid-mediated resistance Plasmid-mediated drug resistance in bacteria occurs by transfer of plasmid and genetic materials. It is mediated by resistance plasmid, otherwise known as R factor.R factors: These are circular, double-stranded DNA molecules that carry the genes responsible for resistance against variety of antibiotics. These factors may carry one or even two or more resistant genes. The genes encode for a variety of enzymes that destroy the antibiotics by degrading antibiotics or modify membrane transport system. For example, the genes code for enzymes like /H9252-lactamases that destroy /H9252-lactam ring (which is responsible for the antibactericidal action of /H9252-lactam antibiot-ics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins). Table 9-3 lists dif-ferent mechanisms of plasmid-mediated resistance in bacteria. Key Points Plasmid-mediated resistance plays a very important role in antibiotics usage in clinical practice. This is because: A high rate of transfer of plasmids from one bacterium to another bacterium takes place by conjugation, Plasmids mediate resistance to multiple antibiotics, and Plasmid-mediated resistance occurs mostly in Gram-negative bacteria. Transposons-mediated drug resistance Drug resistance is also mediated by transposons that often carry the drug resistance genes. Transposons are small pieces of DNA that move from one site of the bacterial chromosome to another and from bacterial chromosome to plasmid DNA. Many R fac-tors carry one or more transposons. Differences between chro-mosomal and transferable drug resistance is listed in Table 9-4. Specific Mechanisms of Resistance Penicillins and cephalosporins Resistance to penicillin is mainly mediated by three mechanisms: (a) production of penicillin-destroying enzymes, (b) mutation genes coding for PBP, and (c) reduced permeability to drug.1. Production of penicillin-destroying enzymes ( /H9252-lactamases): Resistance to penicillins may be determined the organism's production of penicillin-destroying enzymes ( /H9252-lactamases). /H9252-lactamases, such the ring of penicillins and cephalosporins and abolish their antimicrobial activity. /H9252 -lactamases have been described for many species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Some /H9252-lactamases are plasmid-mediated (e.g., penicillinase of S. aureus), while others are chromosomally mediated (e.g., many species of Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., etc). There is one group of /H9252-lactamases that is occasionally found in certain species of Gram-negative bacilli, usually Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. These enzymes are termed extended-spectrum /H9252-lactamases because they confer upon bac- teria an additional ability to hydrolyze the /H9252-lactam rings of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam.2. Mutation in genes coding for PBP: This form of resistance occurs due to the absence of some penicillin receptors (PBP) and occurs as a result of chromosomal mutation. This mecha-nism is responsible for both low-level and high-level resistance seen in S. pneumoniae to penicillin G and in S. aureus to nafcillin.3. Reduced permeability to drug: Low-level resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin is caused by poor permeabil-ity of the drug. However, high-level resistance is mediated by a plasmid coding for penicillinase. Cephalosporins are resistant to /H9252 -lactamases in varying degrees. Vancomycin Resistance to vancomycin is mediated by change in D-ALA-D-ALA part of peptide in the peptidoglycan to D-ALA-D-lactate. TABLE 9-4 Differences between mutational and transferable drug resistance Mutational drug resistance Transferable drug resistance Chromosome mediated Plasmid mediated Resistance to one drug Resistance to multiple drugs Resistance nontransferable Resistance transferable Virulence of organism lowered Virulence of organism not lowered Low-degree resistance High-degree resistance Due to decreased permeability, development of alternate metabolic pathway or inactivation of drugDue to production of many degrading enzymes TABLE 9-3 Plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance Antibiotic Mechanism of resistance /H9252-lactams /H9252-lactamases break down the /H9252-lactam Acetylation of the antibiotic to an inactive form Tetracycline Alteration of cell membrane, decreases permeability to the antibiotic Chap-09.indd 66 5/14/2012 12:33:00 PMANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS: THERAPY AND RESISTANCE 67Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 9This results in the inability of vancomycin to bind to the bacte-ria. Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus spp. is been increas-ingly documented in different clinical conditions.Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE): VRE were first detected in Europe (United Kingdom and France) in 1986 and soon after, a Van B Enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate was reported in the United States. These have now been reported from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Netherland, Spain and Sweden. But the incidence of human VRE infections in European countries is relatively low (1-3%) compared with the high and rising rate in the US. Seven types of glycopeptide resistance have been described among enterococci (VanA, VanB, VanC, VanD, VanE, VanG, and VanL), which named based on their specific ligase genes (e.g.,vanA, vanB, etc.). Related gene clusters have been found in non-pathogenic organisms. The common endpoint of these phenotypes is the formation of a peptidoglycan precursor with decreased affinity for glycopeptides, resulting in decreased inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan precur-sors in in VanB, and VanD strains, whereas VanC, VanE, and VanL (recently described in an E. faecalis strain) isolates produce precursors terminating in d-alanyl-d-serine, instead of the normally occurring d-alanyl-d-alanine. The vanA gene cluster was originally detected in the Tn1546 transposon, and this or related genetic elements are usually carried by plamids and occasionally by host chromosome; this plamid-borne transposon also has been found in clinical isolates of S. aureus (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains). Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is classified as either intrinsic (as a species characteristic) or acquired. The former is a characteristic of the motile species Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens, members of which all carry the naturally occurring vanC-1 and vanC-2/vanC-3 genes, respectively. These enterococci show variable MICs of vancomycin, with many falling in the susceptible range, and clinical failures have been reported following vancomycin use. In general, the isolation of these species does not require strict infection control isola-tion procedures, unless they are highly resistant, suggesting the added presence of potentially transferable vanA or vanB genes. Key Points Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA): In 1997, the first clinical isolate of S. aureus with diminished susceptibility to vancomycin (strain Mu50) was described in Japan. This strain displayed a vancomycin MIC of 8 /H9262g/mL, which is in the range of intermediate susceptibility (4-8 /H9262g/mL) as per the current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints, and thus was referred to as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) or glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA). This initial report was followed by others from various countries. Precursors of these VISA isolates are the heteroresis-tant-VISA (hVISA or hGISA) with subpopulations of cells that are able to grow at a vancomycin concentration of 8 /H9262g/mL. As of late 2008, nine clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) harboring the enterococcal vanA gene have been described in the United States, with MICs ranging from 32 /H9262g/mL to 1024 /H9262g/mL. Aminoglycosides Resistance to aminoglycosides is mediated by three important mechanisms as follows: 1. Plasmid-dependent resistance to aminoglycosides enzymes is the most impor tant mechanism. It depends on the production of plasmid-mediated phosphorylating, adenyl-ating, and acetylating enzymes that destroy the drugs. 2. Chromosomal resistance of microbes to aminoglycosides is the second mechanism. Chromosomal mutation in genes results in the lack of a specif ic protein receptor on the 30S subunit of the ribosome, essential for binding of drug. 3. A \"permeability defect,\" is the third mechanism of resist ance. This leads to an outer membrane change that reduces active transport of the aminoglycoside into the cell so that the drug cannot reach the ribosome. Often this is plasmid-mediated. Tetracyclines Resistance to tetracyclines occurs by three mechanisms: (a) efflux, (b) ribosomal protection, and (c) chemical modifi-cation. The first two are the most important. Efflux pumps, located in the bacterial cell cytoplasmic membrane, are respon-sible for pumping the drug out of the cell. Tet gene products are responsible for protecting the ribosome, possibly through mechanisms that induce conformational changes. These con-formational changes either prevent binding of the tetracyclines or cause their dissociation from the ribosome. This is often plasmid controlled. Macrolides Resistance to macrolides, such as erythromycin, is caused by a plasmid-encoded enzyme that methylates the 23S ribosomal RNA, thereby blocking binding of the drug. Sulfonamides and Trimethoprim Resistance to sulfonamide is caused by plasmid-mediated transport system that actively exports the drug out of bacteria. It is also caused by chromosomal mutation in the gene that codes for the target enzyme dihydrofolate synthetase, resulting in reduced binding affinity of the drug. Resistance to trimethoprim is caused by a chromosomal mutation in the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Quinolones Resistance to quinolone occurs mainly due to chromosomal mutations that modify the bacterial DNA gyrase. Resistance is also caused by changes in the outer membrane proteins of the bacteria, which results in reduced uptake of drug into bacteria. Metronidazole Metronidazole is a bactericidal drug that acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis. It is effective against anaerobes and protozoa. Chap-09.indd 67 5/14/2012 12:33:00 I Chapter Microorganisms resistant to chloramphenicol produce the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase that destroys drug activity. Production of this enzyme is usually mediated by a plasmid. Rifampin Rifampin resistance results from a change in RNA poly-merase due to a chromosomal mutation that occurs with high frequency. Antitubercular drugs include It penetrates well into tissue, fluid, and also acts on intracellular organisms. Resistance to iso-niazid is mainly due to loss of enzyme catalase that activates iso-niazid to active metabolites that inhibit synthesis of mycolic acid. Ethambutol acts by interfering RNA metabolism. The bac-teria develop resistance due to mutation in the gene coding for arabinosyl transferase, which synthesizes arabinogalac-tan in the mycobacterial cell wall. Rifampin inhibits RNA synthesis. The bacteria develop resistance due to mutation in the gene coding for DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Pyrazinamide resistance is due to mutation of gene coding for bacterial amidase, which converts it to its active form, pyrazinoic acid. Combination therapy in tuberculosis is, therefore, essential to prevent emergence of drug resistance. Carbapenems Production of carbapenemases including NDM metallo-betalactamase: New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. These include the antibiotics of car-bapenem family, which are a mainstay for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. The gene for NDM-1 is one member of a large gene family that encodes beta- lactamase enzymes called carbapenemases. Bacteria that produce carbap-enemases are often referred to in the news media as \"superbugs\" because infections caused by them are difficult to treat. Such bac-teria are usually susceptible only to polymyxins and tigecycline. NDM-1 was first detected in a K. pneumoniae isolate from a Swedish patient of Indian origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan, and Brazil. The most common bacteria that make this enzyme are Gram-negative such as E . coli and K. pneumoniae, but the gene for NDM-1 can spread from one strain of bacteria to another by horizontal gene transfer. The NDM-1 enzyme was named after New Delhi, the capi- tal city of India, as it was first described in December 2009 in a Swedish national who fell ill with an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection that he acquired in India. The infection was unsuccessfully treated in a New Delhi hospital, and, after the patient's repatriation to Sweden, a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strain bearing the novel gene was identified. It was concluded that the new resistance mechanism \"clearly arose in India, but there are few data arising from India to sug-gest how widespread it is.\" Its exact geographical origin, how-ever, has not been conclusively verified. In March 2010, a study in a hospital in Mumbai found that most carbapenem-resistant bacteria isolated from patients carried the blaNDM-1 gene. In May 2010, a case of infection with E. coli expressing NDM-1 was reported in Coventry in the United Kingdom. The patient was a man of Indian origin who had visited India 18 months previously, where he had undergone dialysis. In initial assays, the bacterium was fully resistant to all antibiotics tested, while later tests found that it was susceptible to tigecycline and colis-tin. It is believed that international travel and patients' use of multiple countries' healthcare systems could lead to the \"rapid spread of NDM-1 with potentially serious consequences\". Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Antibiotic sensitivity testing is carried out to determine the appropriate antibiotic agent to be used for a particular bacte-rial strain isolated from clinical specimens. Antibiotic sensitiv-ity testing can be carried out by two broad methods, as follows: 1. Disc diffusion tests 2. Dilution tests Disc Diffusion Tests Disc diffusion tests are the most commonly used methods in a laboratory to determine susceptibility of bacteria isolates to antibiotics. In this method, as the name suggests, discs impregnated with known concentrations of antibiotics are placed on agar plate that has been inoculated with a culture of the bacterium to be tested. The plate is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 hours. After diffusion, the concentration of antibi-otic usually remains higher near the site of antibiotic disc, but decreases with distance. Susceptibility to the particular antibi-otic is determined by measuring the zone of inhibition of bacte-rial growth around the disc (Fig. 9-3). Selection of media The medium that supports both test and control strains is selected for carrying out antibiotic susceptibility testing of the bacteria. For example, Mueller-Hinton agar is used for testing Gram-negative bacilli for sulfon- amides and cotrimoxazole. The medium is prepared by pouring onto the flat horizon- tal surface of Petri dishes of 100 mm to a depth of 4 mm. The pH of the medium is maintained at 7.2-7.4. More alkaline pH increases the activity of tetracyclines, novobiocin, and fusidic acid, whereas an acidic pH reduced the activity of aminogly-cosides and macrolides, such as erythromycin. The plates after preparation may be stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 week. Chap-09.indd 68 5/14/2012 12:33:00 PMANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS: THERAPY AND RESISTANCE 69Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 9 Preparation of the inoculum For testing antibiotic sensitivity, the bacteria are first isolated in pure culture on a solid medium. At least three to four morpho-logically similar colonies of the bacteria to be tested are touched and inoculated into appropriate broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4-6 hours. The density of bacterial suspension in the broth is adjusted to 1.5 /H11003 10 8 cfu/mL by comparing its turbidity with that of 0.5 McFarland opacity standard tube. The broth is inoculated on the medium by streaking with sterile swabs. A sterile cotton swab is dipped into the broth and excess broth is removed by rota-tion of the swab against the sides of the tube above the fluid level. Antibiotic discs Only the clinically relevant antibiotics are tested in antibiotic susceptibility tests. Antibiotic discs (6-mm filter paper discs) can be prepared from pure antimicrobial agents in laborato-ries or can be obtained commercially. The discs are applied with sterile forceps, a sharp needle, or a dispenser onto the surface of the medium, streaked with test strains, and the reading is reported after incubating the plate for 18-24 hours at 37\u00b0C aerobically. Types of disc diffusion tests Disc diffusion tests are of the following types: 1. Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method 2. Stokes disc diffusion method 3. Primary disc diffusion test Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method: Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method is the most common method used routinely for determination of antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. In this method, both the test strains and the control strains are tested in separate plates. The test is performed by inoculating the test organism in a suitable broth solution, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2-4 hours. Then 0.1 mL of the broth is inoculated on the surface of the agar medium by streaking with a sterile swab. In this method, either nutrient agar or Mueller-Hinton agar in Petri dishes is used. The inoculated medium is incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The susceptibility of drug is determined from the zones of inhibition of bacterial growth surrounding the anti-biotic discs. The diameters of the zone of inhibition are calcu-lated with vernier calipers or a thin transparent millimeter scale to the nearest millimeter. The point of abrupt diminution of the zone is considered as the zone edge. A maximum of six anti-biotic discs are tested in a Petri dish of 85 mm size (Fig. 9-4). Interpretation of the zone size is done as per the interpreta- tion chart. Depending on the zone size, bacteria can be consid-ered sensitive, intermediate or resistant to antibiotics.Stokes method: This is a disc diffusion method, which makes use of inbuilt controls against many variables. In this method, the Petri dish containing the Mueller-Hinton agar is divided horizontally into three parts. The test strain is inoculated in the central area and the control strains on the upper and lower third of the plate. In modified Stokes method, control strain is inoculated in the central part but test strains are inoculated on the upper and lower third of the plate. The plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C and observed for zones of bacterial inhibition around the discs (Fig. 9-5). A maximum of six antibiotic discs can be applied on a 100 mm Petri dish.Sterile nutrient agarOrganism 37\u00b0C (antibiotic will diffuse in agar radially) No zone of inhibition of growth (organism is resistant to antimicrobial agent) Large zone of inhibition of growth (organism is sensitive to antimicrobial agent) FIG. 9-3.

Chap-09.indd 69 5/14/2012 12:33:00 PMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 70Section I Chapter 9 Reporting of the result is carried out by comparing the zones of inhibition of test and control bacteria. The zone sizes are measured from the edge of the disc to edge of the zone. It is interpreted as follows: Sensitive (S): The zone of test bacterium is equal to or more than that of control strain. The differences between the zone sizes of control and test strains should not be more than 3 mm if the zone size of the test bacterium is smaller than that of control. Intermediate (I): The zone size of the test bacterium should be at least 2 mm, and the differences between the zone of test and control strain should be at least 3 mm. Resistant (R): The zone size of the test bacterium is 2 mm or less. Interpretation of disc diffusion tests: Results of disc diffusion tests, such as Kirby-Bauer and Stokes method, are interpreted as follows: Sensitive (S): Infection treatable by the normal dosage of the antibiotic. Intermediate (I): Infection may respond to higher dosage. Resistant (R): Unlikely to respond to usual dosage of the antibiotics. However, for certain bacteria and antibiotic discs, the following may be kept in mind while interpreting results of disc diffusion tests: 1. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and o ther bacteria producing swarming produce a thin film on agar surface often extend-ing into the zones of inhibition. In such situations, the zones of swarming should be ignored and the outer clear margin should be measured to determine the zones of inhibition. 2. Many strains of MRSA grow very slowly in the presence of methicillin. They produce gro wth within the zone of inhi- bition on incubation for more than 48 hours. This prob-lem can be overcome by incubating the bacteria at 30\u00b0C or by using 5% salt agar and incubating at 37\u00b0C. 3. Penicillinase producing strains of St aphylococcus often fail to secrete enough enzymes to neutralize penicillin close to the antibiotic disc. In such situation, it may show a zone of inhibition, but with the presence of large colonies at the edge of the zone and without any gradual fading away of the growth of the bacteria toward the disc. In such condi-tion, the zones of inhibition should not be considered, and it should be reported resistant irrespective of the zone size. 4. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole should be tested separately to know whe ther the bacterium is sensitive to both or only to one of these. These should never be tested in combination, the way these two drugs are used in com-bination in clinical practice. Key Points Primary disc diffusion test Primary disc diffusion test is a method carried out directly on clinical specimens unlike Kirby-Bauer or Stokes diffusion method that are performed on pure cultures of bacterial iso-lates from clinical specimens. In this method, the clinical spec-imen (e.g., urine) is inoculated uniformly on the surfaces of the agar to which antibiotic discs are applied directly. The plate is incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C for demonstration of zones of inhibition. This method is useful to know the antibiotic sensi-tivity results urgently, but results of this primary disc diffusion test should always be confirmed by testing the isolates subse-quently by Kirby-Bauer or Stokes diffusion method. Dilution Tests Dilution tests are performed to determine the minimum inhib-itory concentration (MIC) of an antimicrobial agent. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits the growth of organisms. Estimation of the MIC is useful to: Regulate the therapeutic dose of the antibiotic accurately in the treatment of many life-threatening situations, such as bacterial endocarditis. Test antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of slow-growing bacteria, such as M. tuberculosis. Following methods are carried out to determine the MIC: 1. Broth dilution method 2. Agar dilution method 3.

Chap-09.indd 70 5/14/2012 12:33:00 PMANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS: THERAPY AND RESISTANCE 71Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 9 Broth dilution method The broth dilution method is a quantitative method for deter-mining the MIC of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits the growth of organisms in vitro. In this method, the antimicrobial agent is serially diluted in Mueller-Hinton broth by doubling dilution in tubes and then a standard suspension of the broth culture of test organism is added to each of the antibiotic dilu-tions and control tube. This is mixed gently and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16-18 hours. An organism of known susceptibility is included as a control. The MIC is recorded by noting the lowest concentration of the drug at which there is no visible growth as demonstrated by the lack of turbidity in the tube. The main advantage of this method is that this is a simple procedure for testing a small number of isolates. The added advantage is that using the same tube, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the bacteria can be determined. The MBC is determined by subculturing from each tube, showing no growth on a nutrient agar without any antibiotics. Subcultures are made from each tube showing no growth into the nutrient agar plates without any antibiotics. The plates are examined for growth, if any, after incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C. The tube containing the lowest concentration of the drug that fails to show any growth on subculture plate is considered as the MBC of the antibiotic for that strain. Broth dilution may be of two types\u2014macrodilution and microdilution. Broth microdilu-tion is done using microtiter plates the \"gold standard.\" Agar dilution method Agar dilution method is a quantitative method for determining the MIC of antimicrobial agent against the test organism. Key Points Agar dilution method is useful: To test organisms from serious infections like bacterial endocarditis or To verify equivocal results of disc diffusion test. Mueller-Hinton agar is used in this method. Serial dilution of the antibiotic are made in agar and poured onto Petri dishes. Dilutions are made in distilled water and added to the agar that has been melted and cooled to not more than 60\u00b0C. One control plate is inoculated without antibiotics. Organism to be tested is inoculated and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Plates are examined for presence or absence of growth of the bacte-ria. The concentration at which bacterial growth is completely inhibited is considered as the MIC of the antibiotic. The organisms are reported sensitive, intermediate, or resis- tant by comparing the test MIC values with that given in CLSI guidelines. The main advantage of the method is that a num-ber of organisms can be tested simultaneously on each plate containing an antibiotic solution. Epsilometer test (E test) Epsilometer test (E test), based on the principle of disc diffu-sion, is an automated system for measuring MIC of a bacterial isolate. In this method, an absorbent plastic strip with a con-tinuous gradient of antibiotic is immobilized on one side. MIC interpretative scale corresponding to 15 twofold MIC dilu-tions is used on the other side. The strip is placed on the agar plate inoculated with the test organism with the MIC scale fac-ing toward the opening side of the plate. An elliptical zone of growth inhibition is seen around the strip after incubation at 37\u00b0C overnight. The MIC is read from the scale at the intersec-tion of the zone with the strip. The end point is always read at complete inhibition of all growth including hazes and isolated colonies. E test is a very useful test for easy interpretation of the MIC of an antibiotic (Fig. 9-6). Antibacterial Assays in Body Fluids Antibacterial assays are carried out to demonstrate the toxic and therapeutic level of the antibiotics in blood and other body fluids. In this method, the MIC of the antibiotic for the test organism is done first by standard broth dilution method. The test with patient's serum is done concurrently. Serial dilutions of the patients' serum in nutrient broth are carried out and to each a standard drop of culture is added and incubated for 18 hours. The highest dilution of serum which has inhibited growth of the assay organism is noted. This is equivalent to the MIC of the antibiotic in question. Multiplication of the MIC by the serum dilution gives the concentration of the antibiotic which was present in the patient's undiluted serum. relationship is determined by the interac-tion between host factors and the infecting microorganisms. Outcome of any microbial infection depends on the interaction between the host and the parasite. The relationship of existence between the host and parasite may be (a) symbiosis, (b) com-mensalism, or (c) disease process: Symbiosis describes a situation where both the microorgan-isms and host species live together with mutual benefit. There is an element of symbiosis in the relationship between the human host and the gut flora; humans provide the bacteria with a warm, moist environment for their survival and gut flora provides a natural barrier against many invading pathogens. Commensalism is an association in which only the micro-organism derives bene t, without causing any injury to the host. Most human microbes are commensals. They are present as bacterial fl ora of the skin and mucous mem-branes, including the upper respiratory tract, the lower gastrointestinal tract, and the vagina. Disease is caused by certain microorganisms known as pathogens. Microorganisms vary in their ability to cause disease in humans. Types of Microorganisms Microorganisms may be of the following types:1. Saprophytes: These are free-living microorganisms that live on dead or decaying organic matter. They are usually present in soil and water. They are generally unable to invade the living body.2. Parasites: These are microorganisms that live on a living host and derive nutrition from the host without any benefit to the host and causes harm to the infected host.3. Commensals: These are microorganisms that live on a liv-ing host without causing any injury to the host. Most human microbes are commensals.4. Pathogens: A microorganism capable of causing disease, especially if it causes disease in immunocompetent people, is called as a pathogen. These pathogens, however, represent a very small proportion of the microbial species.5. Opportunistic pathogens: A microbe that is capable of causing disease only in immunocompromised people is known as opportunistic pathogen. These organisms can cause disease only if one or more of the usual defense mechanisms of humans are reduced or altered by accident, by intent (e.g., surgery), or by an underlying metabolic disorder or an infectious disease (e.g., AIDS). There are two major differences between primary pathogens and opportunistic ones: 1. The first and foremost being that the primary pathogens regularly cause ov ert disease, whereas opportunistic ones take the opportunity offered by reduced host defenses to cause disease. 2. Long-term survival of a microbe is another difference. Long-term survival in a primar y pathogen is absolutely dependent on its ability to replicate and to be transmit-ted in a particular host. However, this is not necessarily the case for a number of the opportunistic pathogens that infect humans. Infection This is a process when an organism enters the body, increases in number, and causes damage to the host. All infections do not invariably result in the disease. The term infection has more than one meaning: (a) the pres- ence of microbes in the body and (b) the symptoms of the dis-ease. The presence of microbes in the body does not always result in symptoms of the disease. Bacteria cause symptoms of disease by two main mechanisms: (a) production of toxins, both endotoxin and exotoxin and (b) production of inflammation. The words \"virulence\" and \"virulent\" are derived from the Latin word virulentus, meaning \"full of poison.\" The term viru- lentus is derived from the Latin words virus (poison) and lentus (fullness), and, in turn, the term virus may be related to the Sanskrit word visham, meaning \"poison.\" Virulence is a measure of a microbe's ability to cause disease. It is a quantitative measure of pathogenicity and is measured by the number of organisms required to cause disease. It means that a highly virulent microbe requires fewer organisms to cause disease than a less virulent one; hence it is directly depen-dent on the infectious dose of the organism. The 50% lethal dose (LD 50) is the number of organisms required to kill half of the hosts, whereas 50% infectious dose (ID 50) is the number of microbes needed to cause infec- tion in half of the hosts. The infectious dose of an organism required to cause disease varies among the pathogenic bacteria. Chap-10.indd 72 5/14/2012 11:45:36 AMMICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS 73Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 10 For example, the infectious dose of Shigella to cause dysentery is less than 100 organisms, whereas that of Salmonella to cause diarrhea is more than 100,000 organisms. The virulence of a microbe is determined by virulence fac- tors, such as capsules, exotoxins, or endotoxins (Table 10-1). Pathogenicity is the capacity of a pathogen species to cause disease, while virulence is used to describe the sum of disease causing properties of a population (strain) within the species. Pathogens can be distinguished from their avirulent counter-parts by the presence of specific genes or gene clusters in the genome known as pathogenicity islands. The diseases that can be spread from one person to another are called communicable diseases. Most microbial infections are communicable diseases. Three epidemiological terms are often used to describe infection: endemic, epidemic, and pandemic: Endemic: The infection that occurs at a persistent, usually low level in a certain geographical area is called endemic. Epidemic: The infection that occurs at a much higher rate than usual is known as epidemic. Pandemic: Infection that spreads rapidly over large areas of the world is known as a pandemic. Types of Infections Infections may be of the following types: Primary infection: This condition denotes an initial infec-tion with an organism in a host. Reinfection: This condition denotes subsequent infection with the same organism in the same host. Secondary infection: This condition denotes an infection with a new organism in a host whose body resistance is already lowered by a pre-existing infectious disease. Cross-infection: This condition denotes an infection with a new organism from another host or another external source in a patient who is already suffering from a disease. Nosocomial infection: Cross-infections acquired in This condition denotes a physician-induced infection as a result of therapy with drugs or inves-tigation procedures. Subclinical infection: Inapparent clinical infections are called subclinical infections. Latent infections: This denotes a condition in which some organisms may remain in a latent or hidden stage in host and subsequently they multiply to produce clinical disease when host resistance is lowered. Stages of Pathogenesis of Infections Infectious diseases are complex. The outcome of infection depends on a variety of factors of the microbe and host as follows: 1. The ability of the organism to break host barriers and to evade destruction by innate local and tissue host defenses. 2. The ability of the organism to replicate, to spread, to est ab- lish infection, and to cause disease. 3. The ability of the organism to transmit to a new suscep tible host. 4. The innate and adaptive immunologic ability of the host to control and eliminate the invading microorganism. The inf ection process involves the following stages: ( a) trans- mission of infection, (b) entry of the organisms and evasion of the local defenses, (c) adherence to cell surfaces, (d) growth and multiplication of the bacteria at the site of adherence, (e) manifestations of disease, and ( f ) termination of disease. Transmission of Infection There are three important components that play an important role in successful transmission of microbial diseases. These are (a) reservoir, (b) mode of transmission, and (c) susceptible host. Reservoir Reservoirs of microbial infections are human, animal, plant, soil, or inanimate matter in which organisms usually live, mul-tiply, and cause the infections with or without overt clinical manifestations. Humans are usually the common reservoirs of many of the microbial infections. Animals are reservoirs of zoonotic infections, such as plague (e.g., rats), rabies (e.g., dogs), cysticercosis (e.g., pigs), etc.Sources of infections: The sources of infections may be endogenous and exogenous: Endogenous sources: The source of infection is the normal bacterial flora present in the human body. These bacteria are usually nonpathogenic but in certain situations become pathogenic and cause infections at different sites in the same host. For example, Escherichia coli present as normal flora of the intestine may cause urinary tract infection in the same host. Similarly, viridans streptococci present as a part of the normal flora of the mouth may cause infective Staphylococcus aureus M protein Streptococcus pyogenes V and W proteins Yersinia pestisTABLE 10-1 Important bacterial surface virulence Chap-10.indd 73 5/14/2012 11:45:37 Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 74Section I Chapter 10 Exogenous sources: The source of infection is from outside the host's body. Most of the microbial infections are exoge-nous in nature. The exogenous sources include the following: 1. Humans: Humans are the most common sources of infections caused by the microorganisms. They may be either patients or carriers. The patient suffering from an active infec-tion is an important source of infection to others. A carrier is a person who harbors pathogenic microorgan- isms without showing any signs and symptoms of disease. Carriers are also important sources of infections. A carrier may be (a ) healthy carrier, (b ) convalescent carrier, (c ) temporary carrier, and (d) chronic carrier. Healthy carrier is the host who harbors the microorgan- ism without ever suffering from the disease caused by that microorganism. Convalescent carrier is the host who continues to harbor the microorganism even after recovering from the clinical disease caused by the same pathogen. Temporary carrier is the host who harbors the microorgan-ism up to 6 months after recovering from the disease caused by the same pathogen. Chronic carrier is the host who harbors the microorgan-ism for many years after recovering from the clinical disease caused by the same pathogen.2. Animals: Animals are also important sources of infection for humans. The symptomatic as well as asymptomatic animals can transmit infections to humans. Asymptomatic animals act as a reservoir of human infections. These are called as reservoir hosts. Infections transmitted from animals to humans are called zoonotic infections. The examples of zoonotic infections include bacterial (e.g., plague, anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, etc.), viral (e.g., rabies, Japanese encephalitis, etc.), fungal (e.g., Insects, such as mosquitoes, ticks, mites, flies, fleas, and lice may transmit a wide variety of microorganisms to the humans (Table 10-2). The diseases transmitted by the insects are collectively referred to as arthropod-borne diseases and the insects transmitting these pathogens are called vec-tors. Insect vectors may transmit the infection in two ways: mechanical transmission and biological transmission. Mechanical vectors: Insects (e.g., domestic flies) carry enteric bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., etc.) mechani- cally on their legs, wings, and surface of the body and trans-fer them to food. Biological vectors: These are the vectors in which the microorganisms multiply or undergo a part of their life Organism Disease Reservoir Insect BacteriaYersinia pestis Plague Rodents, especially rats Rat fleas Francisella Tularemia Rabbits and other fever Humans Lice and deer Ixodes ticks Rickettsia rickettsii Rocky mountain spotted fever Dogs, rodents, Rickettsia prowazekii Epidemic typhus rodents Ticks Trypanosomiasis Humans, armadillos, antelope, Malaria Humans mosquitoes West Nile virus West Nile fever Birds Culex mosquitoes Chikungunya virus Chikungunya Humans and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes Kyasanur forest disease virus Kyasanur forest disease Forest birds and small mammals Tick Yellow fever virus Yellow fever Monkeys and humans Aedes aegypti mosquitoesTABLE 10-2 PATHOGENESIS 75Section III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 10cycle before being transmitted to humans. Rat fl ea and female Anopheles mosquitoes are the examples of biological vectors that transmit plague and malaria, respectively, to humans by biting. Insects, besides acting as vectors, also act as reservoir hosts (e.g., ticks in relapsing fever).4. Food: Food items contaminated with pathogens also act as source of infection and cause diarrhea, dysentery, food poison-ing, and gastroenteritis.5. Water: Water contaminated with microorganisms also acts as a source of infection and transmits water-borne diseases, such as leptospirosis, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A infection, etc. Modes of transmission Microbial pathogens causing various infectious diseases are transmitted from one host to another by many ways: ( a) con- tact, (b) inoculation, (c) ingestion, (d) inhalation, and (e) vectors (Table 10-3).1. Contact: Transmission of microorganisms from person to person occurs by direct or indirect contact. Transmission by direct contact occurs through the acts of touching, kissing, sex, etc. Hence, this mode of transmission is also known as person-to-person transmission. The diseases transmitted by direct contact include common cold, staphylococcal infections, and sexually transmitted infections (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and AIDS, etc.). The term contagious disease was used earlier for the disease acquired by direct contact. Microorganisms can also be transmitted by indirect con- tact through inanimate objects, such as clothings, handker-chief, toys, etc., called fomites. The fomites, contaminated by microbial pathogens, act as a vehicle for their transmission. Influenza, tuberculosis, and certain superficial fungal infec-tions are examples of diseases transmitted by fomites.2. Inoculation: Infections can be transmitted by inoculation of microorganisms directly into tissues of the host. For example, tetanus is transmitted by direct inoculation of Clostridium tetani spores present in soil to the injured tissues in the host. These spores then germinate to vegetative forms of bacteria and migrate along the neural tissues to cause teta-nus. Similarly, rabid dogs through their act of biting inoc-ulate rabies virus directly to host tissue and cause rabies in humans. Iatrogenic infection occurs following the use of unsterile syringes and equipment in a hospital. Hepatitis B and C and HIV infections are the examples of iatrogenic infections caused by use of contaminated syringes and that of contaminated blood and blood products.3. Ingestion: Ingestion of water and food contaminated with microorganisms can transmit a wide variety of micro-bial infections. For example, food poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus is transmitted by rice contaminated with bac-terial spores that survive boiling. If the rice is cooled and reheated, the spores of the bacteria may germinate to the bacteria that produce a heat-stable toxin that induces vomit-ing. Cholera, typhoid, food poisoning, hepatitis A, poliomy-elitis, and many parasitic infections are the other examples of diseases transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food and water.4. Inhalation: Infections are transmitted by inhalation of droplet nuclei that are discharged into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Respiratory pathogens are shed into the environment by patients in secretions from the nose or throat during coughing, sneezing, or talking. Small droplets (less than 0.1 mm in diameter) become airborne as minute particles or droplet nuclei (1-10 /H9262 m in diameter), while large droplets fall down to the ground. Infections are transmitted by inhalation of these droplet nuclei containing respiratory pathogen, which remain suspended in air for a long period of time. Measles, influenza, whooping cough, tuberculosis, aspergil- losis, etc. are few examples of infectious diseases acquired by inhalation.5. Vectors: Mosquitoes, flies, fleas, ticks, mite, and lice are the vectors that transmit many diseases as mentioned earlier. Susceptible host The infective agent enters the body by four main routes: (a) genital tract, (b) respiratory tract, (c) gastrointestinal tract, and (d) skin. The pathogens can be transmitted either as vertical or horizontal transmission.Vertical transmission: Certain bacteria (Treponema palli- dum), viruses (rubella and cytomegalovirus), and parasites (Toxoplasma gondii) can be transferred from mother to fetus by a process called vertical transmission (Table 10-4). The organ-isms can be transmitted vertically by three ways: (a) Across the placenta, (b) Within birth canal during birth, and (c) Through breast milk. Modes of transmissionDisease Causative agents Human to humanDirect coli (EHEC) Handling of fomites Skin infection Staphylococcus aureus Soil borne Tetanus Clostridium tetani Water borne Legionnaire's disease Legionella AMSection III Chapter 43GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY 76Section I Chapter 10 Table 10-4 summarizes a list of diseases transmitted vertically. Horizontal transmission: Unlike vertical transmission, hori- zontal transmission occurs from person to person and is not from mother to offspring (Fig. 10-1). Entry of Organisms and Evasion of Local Defenses Skin, mucus, ciliated epithelium, and secretions containing antibacterial substances (e.g., lysozyme) are the natural barriers of the human and animal hosts that prevent microbial entry. However, these barriers are sometimes broken (e.g., a break in the skin, an ulcer in the intestine, or a tumor, etc.), thereby allowing the entry of microbes into the host (Table 10-5). On entry, the microbes spread through blood circulation to other sites in the body (Fig. 10-2).Skin: The stratified squamous epithelium of the skin with its superficial cornified anucleate layers is a simple and efficient mechanical barrier to prevent microbial invasion. Organisms gain access to the underlying tissues only by breaks or by way of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands that traverse the stratified layers.The surface of the skin continuously desquamates and thereby tends to shed contaminating organisms. The skin also inhibits the growth of most extraneous microorganisms due to its low moisture, low pH, and the presence of substances with an antibacterial activity.Mucus: Viscous mucus secreted by goblet cells protects the epithelium lining the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and urogenital system. Microorganisms become trapped in the mucus layer and may be swept away before they reach the epithelial cell surface. Secretory IgA, secreted into the mucus, and other secreted antimicrobials (such as lysozyme and lacto-ferrin) facilitate this cleansing process.Ciliated epithelial cells: These cells constantly move the mucus away from the epithelial surfaces. For example, mucus in the respiratory tract\u2014particles larger than 5 /H9262m are washed and trapped in the mucus. Similarly, the multilayered transi-tional epithelium of the urinary tract uses the flushing effect of urine, and its relatively low pH acts as an additional defense mechanism to limit microbial entry and growth.Secretions: The high level of hydrochloric acid and gastric enzymes in the normal stomach kills many ingested bacteria. Others are susceptible to pancreatic digestive enzymes or to the detergent effect of bile salts. Adherence to Cell Surfaces Adherence of bacteria to body surface is the most important event in the pathogenesis of disease. Once bacteria enter the body of the host, they must adhere to the cells of a tissue sur-face. If they do not adhere, they will be swept away by mucus and other fluids that bathe the tissue surface.Modes of transmissionOrganism Disease Breast milkBacteria Staphylococcus aureus Skin or oral infection Viruses Human T-cell leukemia virusAsymptomatic Cytomegalovirus AsymptomaticHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)Asymptomatic virus Hepatitis agents FIG. 10-1.

Adherence is important not only during the initial encounter between the pathogen and its host but also throughout the infection cycle. Adherence requires participation of two factors: bacterial adhesins and a receptor on the host cell. Bacterial adhesins Bacterial adherence to the cell surface is mediated by special-ized molecules. The various molecules that mediate adherence to the cell surface are called adhesins. These adhesins allow the bacteria to adhere to the surface of human cell, thereby pro-moting their ability to cause disease. Microorganisms that lack this mechanism are nonpathogenic. Bacterial adhesins can be divided into (fimbriae) and nonpilus adhesins (afimbrial adhesins).Pili: These are the main mechanisms by which bacteria adhere to human cells. They are the fibers that extend from the bacterial surfaces and mediate attachment of bacteria to specific recep-tor on the host cells. The pili of many Gram-negative bacteria bind directly to sugar residues that are part of glycolipids or glycoproteins on the host cells. They also act as a protein scaf-fold to which another more specific adhesive protein is affixed. Key Points Most E. coli strains that cause pyogenic nephritis produce an adhesin protein known as P-pili (pyelonephritis-asso-ciated pili) encoded by pap genes. Many of these adhesin proteins are present at the tip of the pili that bind specific receptors on the surface of the urinary bladder. The bind-ing prevents the bacteria from being washed away from the urinary bladder by the flushing action of the urine. Similarly, the pili of Neisseria gonorrhoeae mediate the attach-ment of the organism by binding to oligosaccharide recep-tors on epithelial cells of the urethra. The gonococci use pili as primary adhesins and opacity-associated proteins (Opa) as secondary adhesins to host cells. Certain Opa proteins medi-ate adherence to polymorphonuclear cells. Some gonococci survive after phagocytosis by these cells. In uterine (fallopian) tube organ cultures, the gonococci adhere to the microvilli of nonciliated cells and appear to induce engulfment by these cells. The gonococci multiply intracellularly and migrate to the subepithelial space by an unknown mechanism. The pili of the Gram-negative bacteria have been classified into five different types and are extremely important in the patho-genesis of infections caused by them. Further antigenic varia-tion in the actual structural pilin protein can be an important source of antigenic diversity for the pathogen. Nonpilus adhesins: These include glycocalyx and other adhesins present bacterial surfaces. Glycocalyx is a polysaccharide \"slime layer\" secreted by some strains of bac-teria that mediates strong adherence to certain structures, such as catheters, prosthetic implants, and heart valves. For example, the glycocalyx of Staphylococcus epidermidis and that of certain viridans streptococci allows the bacteria to adhere strongly to the endothelium of the heart valve. The matrix formed by these adhesins forming proteins is called a biofilm. The bio lms are important in pathogenesis because they protect the bacteria by host defense and antibiotics. FIG. 10-2. Schematic diagram showing various stages of infection process.Portal of entry* Penetration or evasion of host defenses Damage to host cells/ cytopathic effects Portal conversion Also affected by number of invading microbes Adherence Generally the sameas the portals of entryfor a given microbePortal of entry Bacteria Virus Fungi Skin and mucus membrane Clostridium tetani, Leptospira Hepatitis B 78Section I Chapter 10The bio lms facilitate colonization of bacteria, especially of surgical appliances, such as arti cial valve or indwelling catheters. Streptococcus pyogenes makes use of nonpilus adhesins (such as lipoteichoic acid, protein F, and M protein) to bind to epithe-lial cells. The lipoteichoic acid and protein F cause adherence of the streptococci to buccal epithelial cells. M protein acts as an antiphagocytic molecule. Recently, it has been shown that certain strains of E. coli and Shigella spp. have surface proteins called curli, which help in the binding of bacteria to the host endothelium as well as to extracellular proteins. Receptor on the host cell Certain receptors are present on the host cells to which patho-gens adhere and initiate infections. For example, many a dhe-sion proteins are present at the tip of the pili of E. coli. These bind specific receptors on the surface of the urinary bladder to initiate urinary tract infections. Similarly, the gonococci adhere to the microvilli of nonciliated cells and start disease process. Growth and Multiplication of Bacteria at the Site of Adherence Bacteria cause diseases by three main mechanisms: (a) inva-sion of tissues followed by inflammation, ( b) toxin production, and (c) immunopathogenesis. Table 10-6 summarizes a list of bacteria with their virulence factors. Invasion of tissues followed by inflammation Invasiveness refers to the ability of an organism to invade the host cells after establishing infection. \"Invasion\" is the term commonly used to describe the entry of bacteria into host cells, implying an active role for the organisms and a passive role for the host cells. For many disease-causing bacteria, invasion of the host's epithelium is central to the infectious process. Some bacteria (e.g., Salmonella spp.) invade tissues through the intracellular junctions in the cytoplasm. Some bacteria (e.g., Shigella spp.) multiply within host cells, whereas other bacteria do not. Shigella spp. initiate infection process by adhering to host cells in the small intestine. There are multiple proteins, including the invasion plasmid antigens (IpA-D), that contribute to the process. Once inside the cells, the shigellae either are lysed or escape from the phagocytic vesicle, where they multiply in the cytoplasm. Other bacteria (e.g., Yersinia species, N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis) invade specific types of the host's epithelial cells and may subsequently enter the tissue. Once inside the host cell, the bacteria may remain enclosed in a vacuole composed of the host cell membrane, or the vacuole membrane may dis-solved and bacteria may disperse within the cell and from one cell to another. Invasion of tissues followed by inflammation is enhanced by many factors, which include: (a) enzymes, (b) antiphagocytic factors, (c) biofilms, (d) inflammation, and (e) intracellular survival. 1. Enzymes: In vasion of bacteria is enhanced by man y enzymes. Many species of bacteria produce enzymes that are not intrin-sically toxic but do play important roles in the infectious process. Some of these enzymes are discussed below: Hyaluronidases and collagenase: Hyaluronidases and col-lagenase are the enzymes that hydrolyze hyaluronic acid and degrade collagen, respectively; thereby allowing the bacteria to spread through subcutaneous tissues. Hyaluronidases are produced by many bacteria (e.g., staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes) and aid in their spread through tissues. For example, hyaluroni-dase produced by S. pyogenes degrades hyaluronic acid in the subcutaneous tissue, thereby facilitating the organ-ism to spread rapidly. Clostridium perfringens produces the proteolytic enzyme which degrades collagen (the major protein of brous connective tissue), and promotes the spread of infection in tissue. Coagulase: Staphylococcus aureus produces the enzyme coagulase, which in association with blood factors coagulates the plasma. Coagulase contributes to the formation of fibrin walls around staphylococcal lesions, which protects bacteria from phagocytosis by walling off the infected area. The enzyme also causes deposition of fibrin on the surfaces of individual staphylococci, which may help protect them from phagocytosis or from destruction within phagocytic cells. Streptokinase ( fibrinolysin): proteolytic enzyme of plasma. This enzyme is then able to dissolve coagulated plasma and thereby possibly aids in the rapid spread of streptococci through tissues. Streptokinase has been used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to dissolve fibrin clots.Organism Virulence factors Staphylococcus 11:45:38 AMMICROBIAL III Chapter 43 Section I Chapter 10 IgA1 proteases: Certain pathogenic bacteria produce enzymes IgA1 proteases that split IgA1 at specific pro-line-threonine or proline-serine bonds in the hinge region and inactivate its antibody activity. IgA1 protease is an important virulence factor of the pathogens, N. gonorrhoeae, pathogens to inactivate the primary antibody found on mucosal surfaces and thereby facilitates the attachment of these bacteria to the mucous membrane. 2. Antiphagocytic factors: Many bacterial pathogens are rapidly killed once they are ingested by polymor phonuclear cells or macrophages. Some microbicidal mechanisms by several anti-phagocytic factors; the most important being (a ) capsule, (b) cell wall proteins, (c ) cytotoxins, and (d ) surface antigens. Capsule: The capsule surrounding bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae (Fig. 10-3) and N. meningitidis, is the most important antiphagocytic factor. It retards the phago-cytosis of bacteria by preventing the phagocytes from adhering to the bacteria. Cell wall proteins: The cell wall proteins, such as the protein A and protein M, of S. aureus and S. pyogenes especially are antiphagocytic. For example, protein A of S. aureus binds to IgG and prevents the activation of complement. M protein of S. pyogenes is antiphagocytic. Cytotoxins: Certain bacteria produce cytotoxins that interfere with chemotaxis or killing of phagocytes. For example, S. aureus produces hemolysins and leukocidins that lyse and damage RBCs and WBCs. Surface antigens: Surface antigens of bacteria, such as Vi antigen of S. typhi and K antigen of E. coli make the bacteria resistant to phagocytosis and lytic activity of complement. A list of intracellular pathogens is given in Table 10-7. 3. Bio lms: The bio lm is an aggregate of interactive bacteria attached to a solid surface or to each other and encased in an exopolysaccharide matrix. Bio lms consist of single cells and microcolonies of bacteria, all found together in a highly hydrated, predominantly anionic exopolymer matrix. This is distinct from planktonic or free-living bacterial growth, in which interactions of the microorganisms do not occur. Bio lms form a slimy coat on solid surfaces and occur throughout the nature. A single species of bacteria may be involved, or more than one species may coaggregate to form a bio lm. Fungi, including yeasts, are occasionally involved. Bio lms are important in human infections that are persis- tent and dif cult to treat. A few such infections include: (a) S. epidermidis and S. aureus infections of central v enous catheters; (b) Eye infections that occur with contact lenses and intraocular lenses; (c) Infections in dental plaque; and (d) Pseudomonas aeruginosa airwa y infections in cystic brosis patients. Key Points Bio lm confers an inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents, whether these antimicrobial agents are antibiotics, disinfec-tants, or germicides. The mechanisms of resistance are: Delayed penetration of antimicrobial agent through the biofilm matrix; Altered growth rate of biofilm organisms; and Other physiological changes due to biofilm mode of growth. 4. Infl ammation: Infl ammation is an im portant host defense induced by the presence of bacteria in the body. It is of two types: pyogenic and granulomatous. Pyogenic infl ammation is the host defense seen primarily against pyogenic or pus-producing bacteria, such as S. pyogenes. It typically consists of neutrophils and the production of speci c antibodies and elevated level of complement. Granulomatous infl am- mation is the host defense seen primarily against intracel-lular granuloma-producing bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae , etc. The response consists of production of diagram I Chapter 10 5. Intracellular survival: A few mechanisms that are suggested for intracellular survival of bacteria include (a) inhibition of phagolysosome fusion, (b) resistance to action of lysosomal enzymes, and (c) adaptation to cyto-plasmic replication as follows: Bacteria (such as Chlamydia, M. tuberculosis) that interfere with the formation of phagolysosomes in a phagocyte can survive intracellularly and evade host defense pro-cess. These bacteria live within cells and are protected from attack by macrophages and neutrophils. The bac-teria that do not interfere with the formation of phagoly-sosomes are otherwise killed inside the phagocytes. Presence of capsular polysaccharide in Mycobacterium lepraemurium and mycoside in M. tuberculosis makes these bacteria resistant to action of lysosomal enzymes. Certain bacteria, such as rickettsiae, escape from the phagosome into the cytoplasm of the host cell before the fusion of phagosome with lysosome takes place and hence continue to remain intracellular. Toxin production Toxins produced by bacteria are generally classified into two groups: exotoxins and endotoxins. 1. Exotoxins: Exo toxins are pro- duced by several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These are bacterial products, which are secreted into tissues and directly harm tissues or trigger destructive biological activities (Fig. 10-4). The genes coding for these proteins are frequently encoded on plasmid or on bacteriophage DNA. Some important toxins encoded by plasmids are tetanus toxin of C. tetani and heat-labile and heat-stable toxins of enterotoxigenic bacteriophage cholera toxins, diphtheria toxins, and botulinum toxin. Superantigens: Superantigens are group of toxins. These molecules activate T-cell nonspeci cally by binding simultaneously to a T-cell receptor and major histocom-patibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules on another cell, without requiring antigen. Nonspeci c activation of T cells results in a life-threatening autoimmune-like response by producing a large amount of interleukins, such as IL-1 and IL-2. Furthermore, stimulation of T cells by superantigen can also lead to the death of activated T cell, resulting in loss of speci c T-cell clones and that of their immune response. Staphylococcal enterotoxin (toxic shock syndrome toxin) of S. aureus and erythrogenic toxin of type A or C of S. pyogenes are examples of superantigens. 2. Endotoxins: The term endo to xin was coined in 1893 by Pfeiffer to distinguish the class of toxic substances released after lysis of bacteria from the toxic substances (exotoxins) secreted by bacteria. Exotoxin Cell wall Endotoxin FIG. 10-4. Schematic diagram showing release of exotoxin and endotoxin. Key Points Exotoxins show the following features: Exotoxins are good antigens; they induce the synthesis of pro-tective antibody called antitoxins. Some of these antitoxins are useful in the treatment of botulism, tetanus, and other dis-eases. Exotoxins treated with formaldehyde or acid or heat can be converted into toxoid. The toxoids lack toxicity but retain antigenicity. Hence, these are used in protective vaccines. Exotoxins are some of the most toxic substances known. They are highly potent even in minute amounts. Botulinum toxin is the most potent one, and it has been estimated that 3 kg of botulinum toxin can kill all persons in the world. Similarly, the fatal dose of tetanus toxin for a human is esti-mated to be less than 1 /H9262g. Many toxins have a dimeric A-B subunit structure. Diphtheria toxin, tetanus toxin, cholera toxins, and the enterotoxin of E. coli are some of the examples of exotoxins that have an A-B subunit structure. A is the active subunit that possesses the toxic activity, and B is the binding subunit that is responsible for the binding of exotoxin to specific receptors of the membrane of human cell (Fig. 10-5). These toxins are very specific in their mechanism of action and act at specific sites of a tissue. The biochemical targets of A-B toxin include ribosomes, transport mechanisms, signaling (cyclic monophos-phate, CAMP; protein production); all these cause diar-rhea, loss of neuronal functions, or even death. The exotoxins have specific pharmacological activities and do not produce fever, unlike endotoxins. Key Points Endotoxins show the following properties: They are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, but not by Gram-positive bacteria. They are lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. These form an inte-gral part of the cell wall unlike exotoxins, which are actively released from the cells. The genes that encode the enzymes that produce the LPS are present on the bacterial chromosome, but not on plasmids or bacteriophage DNA, which usually encodes the exotoxins. They are heat stable, and they are released from the bacte-rial cell surface by disintegration of the cell wall. They are weakly antigenic and do not induce, or poorly induce, protective antibodies. Hence, their action is not neutralized by the protective antibodies. They cannot be toxoided. Chap-10.indd 80 5/14/2012 11:45:38 AMMICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS 81Section III Chapter Section I Chapter 10 Biological activity of endotoxin: Gram-negative bacteria produce endotoxin during infection. The toxicity of endo-toxin is low in comparison with exotoxins. All endotoxins usually produce the same generalized effect of fever and shock. The lipid A protein of LPS is responsible for endo-toxin activities (Table 10-8). The endotoxin binds to speci c receptors, such as CD14 and TLR4, present on macro-phages, B cells, and other cells. Endotoxin exerts profound biological effects on the host and may be lethal. Biological activities of the endotoxins include the following: Mitogenic effects on B lymphocytes that increase resis-tance to viral and bacterial infections. Production of gamma interferon by T lymphocytes, which may enhance the antiviral state, promote the rejection of tumor cells, and activates the macrophages and natural killer cells. Activation of the complement cascade with the forma-tion of C3a and C5a. Production and release of Endotoxic shock: Endotoxins at low concentration induce a protective response, such as fever, vasodilation, and activation of immunity and infl ammatory response. However, endotoxins at very high concentration, as seen in blood of patients with Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, cause a syndrome of endotoxic shock. Endotoxic shock is characterized by fever, leukopenia, thrombocytope-nia, sudden fall of blood pressure, circulatory collapse, and sudden death. This is because high concentration of endotoxin can activate the alternative pathway of complement and cause vasodilatation and capillary leak-age, resulting in high fever, hypertension, and shock. It also causes activation of blood coagulation pathway, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Endotoxins are not destroyed by autoclaving; hence infu-sion of sterile solution containing endotoxins can cause serious illness.Detection of endotoxins in medical solutions: Endotoxins are omnipresent in the environment. Solutions for human use (such as intravenous fl uids) are prepared under carefully controlled conditions to ensure sterility and to remove endotoxin. Representative samples of every manufacturing batch are checked for endotoxins by one of two procedures: (a) limulus lysate test or (b) rabbit pyrogenicity test. Limulus lysate test: The test depends on the ability of endotoxin to induce gelation of lysates of amoebocyte cells from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. Test kits are commercially available. It is simple, fast, and sensitive to detect endotoxin at a level of 1 ng/mL. Rabbit pyrogenicity test: The test depends on the exquisite sensitivity of rabbits to the pyrogenic effects of endo-toxin. In this test, a sample of the solution to be tested is injected intravenously into the ear veins of adult rab-bits, while the rectal temperature of the animal is moni-tored. Careful monitoring of the temperature responses provides a sensitive and reliable indicator of the pres-ence of endotoxin in the solution.

For example, immune complexes deposited in the glomerulus of the kidney cause poststreptococcal glo-merulonephritis. Antibodies that are produced against the M proteins of S. pyogenes cross-react with joint, heart, and brain tissues producing disease manifestations of rheumatic fever. Similarly, the host immune response is an important cause of disease symptoms in patients suffering from syphilis caused by T. pallidum, Lyme disease caused by Borrelia, and other diseases. Manifestations of Disease Diseases caused by various pathogenic as well as opportunistic pathogens cause a variety of clinical manifestations in infected human hosts. Many of these manifestations are caused either due to the inflammation or toxin production by the bacteria. Termination of Disease Termination of an infectious disease may occur by resolution or continuation of the disease. This depends on a complex interaction of host immunity with pathogens and host response to treatment with specific antimicrobial agents. Stages of an Infectious Disease There are four discrete stages of an infectious disease, which are as follows: 1. Incubation period: This denotes the time inter val between the entry of infective agent and the onset of clinical mani-festations of disease. During this period, the infective agent after reaching the selective tissue undergoes multiplication. 2. Prodrome period: It is the time during which only non-speci c sym ptoms of disease occur. 3. Speci c illness period: The time during which the charac- teristic f eatures of disease occur. 4. Recovery period: The time during which symp toms resolve and health is restored. Not all the cases that recover become free of organism. Some become chronic carriers and act as sources of infection for others. Though some cases may not develop infection, they can act as a link in the transmission of infection. This is called subclinical infection. Chap-10.indd 82 5/14/2012 Leprae43 Immunity11 Introduction The term immunity is derived from the Latin word \"immunis\" (exempt), which was originally referred to the protection from legal prosecution offered to the Roman senators during their tenures in office. This term was adopted subsequently to des-ignate the naturally acquired protection against diseases, such as measles or smallpox. It indicated that an individual can develop lifelong resistance to a certain disease after having con-tracted it only once. The cells and molecules responsible for immunity constitute the immune system , and their collec tive and coordinated response to foreign substances is called the immune response. The concept of immunity has existed since the ancient times. An example is the Chinese custom of making children resistant to smallpox by making them inhale powders made from the skin lesions of patients recovering from the disease. The first European mention of immunity is recorded by Thucydides in Athens during the fifth century BC. In describing plague in Athens, he wrote in 430 BC that only those who had recovered from plague could nurse the sick, because they would not con-tract the disease a second time. Once the concept of existence of immunity was established, it was not long before manipulation of immunity under con-trolled conditions followed. First, it was Edward Jenner who in a successful experiment injected the material from a cowpox pustule into the arm of an 8-year-old boy and demonstrated the lack of development of disease after subsequent exposure to smallpox. This was based on his observations that milk-maids who had suffered from cowpox never contracted the more serious smallpox. Jenner's technique of inoculating with cowpox to protect against smallpox spread quickly throughout Europe. However, for many reasons, including lack of knowl-edge of obvious disease targets and their causes, it was after nearly hundred years that this technique was applied to pre-vent smallpox. The experimental work of Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1890 gave the first insights into the mechanism of immunity, earning von Behring the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901. Von Behring and Kitasato demonstrated that serum (the liquid, noncellular component of coagulated blood) from animals previously immunized to diphtheria could trans-fer the immune state to unimmunized animals. Since then, immunology as a field of study has come a long way. It has been and remains one of the hottest fields of research as shown by the statistic that about 17 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists involved in immunological research. Types of Immunity The main function of the immune system is to prevent or limit infections by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. The recognition of microorganisms and for-eign substances is the first event in immune responses of a host. The body's defense mechanisms can be divided into: (a ) innate (natural) immunity and (b ) acquired (adaptive) immunity. Innate Immunity Innate immunity is the resistance that an individual possesses by birth. Innate immunity may be classi ed as (a) individual immunity, (b) racial immunity, and (c) species immunity.Individual immunity: Individual immunity denotes resis-tance to infection, which varies within different individuals in the same race and species and is genetically determined. For example, if one homozygous twin develops tuberculosis, there is a very high possibility that the other twin will also develop tuberculosis. But in heterozygous twins, there is a very low possibility of the other twin suffering from tuberculosis.Racial immunity: Racial immunity denotes a difference in susceptibility or resistance to infection among different races within a same species. For example, races with sickle cell ane-mia prevalent in Mediterranean coast are immune to infection caused by malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This is due to a genetic abnormality of erythrocytes, resulting in sickle-shaped erythrocytes that prevent parasitization by P. falciparum. Similarly, individuals with a hereditary deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase are also less susceptible to infection by P. falciparum. Species immunity: Species immunity denotes a total or relative resistance to a pathogen shown by all members of a particular spe-cies. For example, chickens are resistant to Bacillus anthracis, rats are resistant to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, whereas humans are susceptible to these bacteria. The exact reason for such type of immunity is not known. Chap-11.indd 85 5/14/2012 1:27:20 PMIMMUNOLOGY 86Section II Chapter 11Key Points Innate immunity shows the following features: It is due to the genetic and constitutional makeup of an individual. Prior contact with microorganisms or their products is not essential. It acts as the first line of defense of the host immune system. The mechanisms involved in innate immunity are present in place even before exposure to the foreign agent. They are not specific to any infectious agent and do not seem to improve response on repeated exposures. Phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages and neutrophils), bar-riers (e.g., skin and mucous membrane), and a variety of antimicrobial compounds synthesized by the host, all play important roles in innate immunity. Factors influencing innate immunity The factors that may influence innate immunity of the host include age and nutritional status of the host.Age: Extremes of age make an individual highly susceptible to various infections. This is explained in part by the immature immune system in very young children and waning immunity in older individuals. The fetus-in-utero is usually protected from maternal infections by the placental barrier. However, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rubella virus, cytomeg-alovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii cross the placental barrier and cause congenital infections. Very old people are susceptible to suffer more than young people from a disease (e.g., pneumonia) and have high mortal-ity. Measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, and chicken pox are few examples of the diseases that cause more severe clinical illness in adults than in young children. This may be due to more active immune response in an adult causing greater tissue damage.Nutritional status: Nutritional status of the host plays an important role in innate immunity. Both humoral and cell-mediated immunities are lowered in malnutrition. Examples are: Neutrophil activity is reduced, interferon response is decreased, and C3 and factor B of the complement are decreased in protein-calorie malnutrition. Deficiency of vitamin A, vitamin C, and folic acid makes an individual highly susceptible to infection by many microbial pathogens. Hormonal levels: Individuals with certain hormonal disorders become increasingly susceptible to infection. For example, indi-viduals suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and adrenal dysfunction are susceptible to staphylococ-cal streptococcal infection, candidiasis, aspergillosis, zygomycosis and many other microbial infections. Similarly, pregnant women are more susceptible to many infections due to higher level of steroid during pregnancy. Mechanisms of innate immunity Innate immunity of the host performs two most impor-tant functions: it kills invading microbes and it activates acquired (adaptive) immune processes. Innate immunity unlike adaptive immunity, however, does not have any memory and does not improve after re-exposure to the same microorganism. The innate immunity is primarily dependent on four types of defensive barriers: (a) anatomic barriers, (b) physiologic barriers, (c) phagocytosis, and (d) inflammatory responses.Anatomic barriers: Anatomic barriers include skin and mucous membrane. They are the most important components of innate immunity. They act as mechanical barriers and prevent entry of microorganisms into the body. The intact skin prevents entry of microorganisms. For example, breaks in the skin due to scratches, wounds, or abrasion cause infection. Bites of insects harboring pathogenic organisms (e.g., mosquitoes, mites, ticks, fleas, and sandflies), introduce the pathogens into the body and transmit the infection. Skin secretes sebum, which prevents growth of many microorganisms. The sebum consists of lactic acid and fatty acids that maintain the pH of skin between 3 and 5, and this pH inhibits the growth of most microorganisms. Mucous membranes form a large part of outer cover- ing of gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary, and many other tracts of human host. A number of nonspecific defense mechanisms act to prevent entry of microorganisms through mucous membrane. Saliva, tears, and mucous secretions tend to wash away potential invading microorganisms, thereby preventing their attachment to the initial site of infections. These secre-tions also contain antibacterial or antiviral substances that kill these pathogens. Mucus is a viscous fluid secreted by the epithelial cells of mucous membranes that entraps invading microorganisms. In lower respiratory tract, mucous membrane is covered by cilia, the hair-like protrusions of the epithelial cell mem-branes. The synchronous movement of cilia propels mucus-entrapped microorganisms from these tracts. In addition, nonpathogenic organisms tend to colonize the epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces. These normal flora generally compete with pathogens for attachment sites on the epithelial cell surface and for necessary nutrients. Physiologic barriers: The physiologic barriers that contribute to innate immunity include the following: Gastric acidity is an innate physiologic barrier to infection because very few ingested microorganisms can survive the low pH of stomach contents. Lysozyme, interferon, and complement are some of the soluble mediators of innate immunity. Lysozyme has anti-bacterial effect due to its action on the bacterial cell wall. Interferons are secreted by cells in response to products of viral infected cells. These substances have a general antiviral effect by preventing the synthesis of viral structural proteins. Complement is a group of serum-soluble substances that when activated damage the cell membrane. There are certain types of molecules that are unique to microbes and are never found in multicellular organisms. The ability of the host to immediately recognize and com-bat invaders displaying such molecules is a strong feature of innate immunity. Chap-11.indd 86 5/14/2012 1:27:21 PMSection II Chapter 11IMMUNITY 87 Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is another important defense mechanism of the innate immunity. Phagocytosis is a process of ingestion of extracellular particulate material by certain specialized cells, such as blood monocytes, neutrophils, and tis-sue macrophages. It is a type of endocytosis in which invading microorganisms present in the environment are ingested by the phagocytic cells. In this process, plasma membrane of the cell expands around the particulate material, which may include whole pathogenic microorganisms to form large vesicles called phagosomes.Inflammatory responses: Tissue damage caused by a wound or by an invading pathogenic microorganism induces a com-plex sequence of events, collectively known as the inflamma-tory responses. The end result of inflammation may be the activation of a specific immune response to the invasion or clearance of the invader by components of the innate immune system. The four cardinal features of inflammatory responses are rubor (redness), calor (rise in temperature), dolor (pain), and tumor (swelling).Mediators of inflammatory reactions: Histamine, kinins, acute- phase proteins, and defensin are the important mediators of inflammatory reactions. Histamine: It is a chemical substance produced by a variety of cells in response to tissue injury. It is one of the principal mediators of the infl ammatory response. It binds to recep- tors on nearby capillaries and venules, causing vasodilata-tion and increased permeability. Kinins: These are other important mediators of inflamma-tory response. They are normally present in blood plasma in an inactive form. Tissue injury activates these small peptides, which then cause vasodilatation and increased permeability of capillaries. Bradykinin also stimulates pain receptors in the skin. This effect probably serves a protective role because pain normally causes an individual to protect the injured area. Acute-phase proteins: These include C-reactive pro-teins and mannose-binding proteins that form part of the innate immunity. These proteins are produced at an increased concentration in plasma during acute-phase reaction, as a nonspecific response to microorganisms and other forms of tissue injury. They are synthesized in the liver in response to cytokines called proinflammatory cytokines, namely, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (TNF). They are called pro-inflammatory cytokines because they enhance the inflam-matory responses. Defensins: They are another important component of the innate immunity. They are cationic peptides that produce pores in membrane of the bacteria and thereby kill them. These are present mainly in the lower respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. The respiratory tract contains /H9252-defensins, whereas the gastrointestinal tract contains /H9251-defensins. The /H9251-defensins also exhibit antiviral activ-ity. They bind to the CXCR4 receptors and block entry of HIV virus into the cell. How these defensins differentiate microbes from some cells is not known. Adaptive (Acquired) Immunity Adaptive immunity is also called acquired immunity, since the potency of immune response is acquired by experience only. Differences between innate and acquired immunity are summarized in Table 11-1.

Humoral immunity: It is mediated by molecules in the blood and mucosal secretions called antibodies. The anti-bodies are secreted by a subset of lymphocytes known as B cells. The antibodies recognize microbial antigens, combine specifically with the antigens, neutralize the infectivity of microbes, and target microbes for elimina-tion by various effector mechanisms. Humoral immunity is the principal defense mechanism against extracellular microbes. Cell-mediated immunity: It is mediated by both activated TH cells and CTLs. Cytokines secreted by TH cells activate various phagocytic cells, enabling them to phagocytose and kill microorganisms. This type of cell-mediated immune response is especially important against a host of bacte-rial and protozoal pathogens. CTLs play an important role in killing virus-infected cells and tumor cells. They act by killing altered self-cells. Differences between humoral and cell-mediated immunities are summarized in Table 11-2.Antigen recognition: Antigens, which are generally very large and complex, are not recognized in their entirety by lympho-cytes. Instead, both B and T lymphocytes recognize discrete sites on the antigens called antigenic determinants, or epitopes. Epitopes are the immunologically active regions on a com-plex antigen, the regions that actually bind to B-cell or T-cell receptors.Key Points Adaptive immunity shows the following features: It is the resistance acquired by an individual during life. It occurs after exposure to an agent and is mediated by antibodies as well as T lymphocytes (helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells). It has immunologic memory and a remarkable capability of discriminating between self and nonself antigens. Once an antigen has been recognized by the cells of acquired immune system, the response to it is specific and can be repeated. In most cases, the acquired immune response improves with repeated exposure. The immune response to the second challenge occurs more quickly than the first, is stronger, and is often more effec-tive in neutralizing and clearing the pathogen. Types of acquired immunity Acquired immunity against a microbe may be induced by the host's response to the microbe or by transfer of antibodies or lymphocytes specific for the microbes. It is of two types: active immunity and passive immunity. Active immunity The immunity induced by exposure to a foreign antigen is called active immunity. Active immunity is the resistance devel- oped by an individual after contact with foreign antigens, e.g., microorganisms. This contact may be in the form of: clinical or subclinical infection, immunization with live or killed infectious agents or their antigens, or exposure to microbial products, such as toxins and toxoids. In all these circumstances, the immune system of the host is stimulated to elicit an immune response consisting of antibod-ies and activated helper T (T H) cells and cytotoxic T lympho- cytes/cells (CTLs). Active immunity develops after a latent period, during which immunity of the host is geared up to act against the microorganism. Hence it is slow in onset, especially during this primary response. However, once the active immunity develops, it is long-lasting and this is the major advantage of the active immunity. The active immunity is of two types: natural active immunity and artificial active immunity. Natural active immunity: It is acquired by natural clinical or subclinical infections. Such natural immunity is long-lasting. For example, individuals suffering from smallpox become immune to second attack of the disease. Artificial active immunity : It is induced in individuals by vaccines. There is a wide range of vaccines available against many microbial pathogens. These may be live vaccines, killed vaccines, or vaccines containing bacterial products (Table 11-2). Mediators of active immunity: Active immunity is mediated by humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. These two Cell-mediated immunityHumoral immunity Immune response mediated by cellsImmune response mediated by antibodies Protects against fungi, viruses, and facultative intracellular bacterial pathogensProtects against extracellular bacterial pathogens and viruses infecting respiratory or intestinal tract; and prevents recurrence of viral infections Mediates delayed (type IV) hypersensitivityMediates immediate (types I, II, and III) hypersensitivity Only T-cell-dependent antigens lead to cell-mediated immunityB cells directly bind soluble antigens resulting in production of antibodies Both CD4/H11001 and CD8/H11001 T cells are involvedOnly T H cells are involved Provides immunological surveillance and immunity against cancerNo major role in immunological surveillance Participates in rejection of homografts and graft-versus-host reactionMay be involved in early graft rejection due to preformed antibodiesTABLE 11-2 Differences 1:27:21 PMSection II Chapter 11IMMUNITY 89 B cells and T cells differ in their mechanisms of antigen recognition. While B cells recognize the antigen by interacting with the epitope on their own, T cells recognize the antigen only when the epitope is \"presented\" by one of the specialized antigen-presenting cells. Once the antigen has been recognized, these cells then go on to diversify by several intricate mecha-nisms. This diversification helps in conferring the specificity, one of the cardinal characteristics of the immune system.Major histocompatibility complex (MHC): It is a large genetic complex with multiple loci. The MHC loci encode two major classes of membrane-bound glycoproteins: class I and class II MHC molecules. Class II molecules present antigens to the T H cells, while class I molecules do the same for CTLs. In order for a foreign protein antigen to be recognized by a T cell, it must be degraded into small antigenic peptides that form complexes with class I or class II MHC molecules. This con-version of proteins into MHC-associated peptide fragments is called antigen processing and presentation. Passive immunity When immunity is conferred by transfer of serum or lympho-cytes from a specifically immunized individual, it is known as passive immunity. This is a useful method for conferring resis-tance rapidly, i.e., without waiting for the development of an active immune response. Passive immunity may be natural or artificial.Natural passive immunity: It is observed when IgG is passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy. This forms the basis of prevention of neonatal tetanus in neonates by active immu-nization of pregnant mothers. It is achieved by administering tetanus toxoid to pregnant mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. This induces production of high level of antibod- ies in mother against tetanus toxin, which are subsequently transmitted from mother to fetus through placenta. The anti-bodies subsequently protect neonates after birth against the risk of tetanus. Natural passive immunity is also observed by passage of IgA from mother to newborn during breast feeding.Artificial passive immunity: It is induced in an individ- ual by administration of preformed antibodies, generally in the form of antiserum, raised against an infecting agent. Administration of these antisera makes large amounts of antibodies available in the recipient host to neutralize the action of toxins. The preformed antibodies against rabies and hepatitis A and B viruses, etc. given during incubation period prevent replication of virus, and hence alter the course of infection. Immediate availability of large amount of antibodies is the main advantage of passive immunity. However, short lifes-pan of these antibodies and the possibility of hypersensitiv-ity reaction, if antibodies prepared in other animal species are given to individuals who are hypersensitive to these animal globulins (e.g., serum sickness), are the two noted disadvan-tages of passive immunity.Differences between active and passive immunity are summarized in Table 11-3. Combined passive-active immunity is carried out by giving both preformed antibodies (antiserum) and a vaccine to provide immediate protection and long-term protection, respectively, against a disease. This approach is followed for prevention of certain infectious conditions, namely, tetanus, rabies, and hepatitis B. Local Immunity The immunity at a particular site, generally at the site of invasion and multiplication of a pathogen, is referred to as local immunity. Local immunity is conferred by secretory IgA antibodies in various body secretions. These antibodies are produced locally by plasma cells present on mucosal surfaces or in secretory glands. Natural infection or attenuated live viral vaccines given orally or intranasally induces local immunity at gut mucosa and nasal mucosa, respectively. Herd Immunity Herd immunity refers to an overall level of immunity in a commu-nity. Eradication of an infectious disease depends on the devel-opment of a high level of herd immunity against the pathogen. Epidemic of a disease is likely to occur when herd immunity against that disease is very low indicating the presence of a larger number of susceptible people in the community.Passive immunity Active immunity No active host participation; received passively Produced actively by host's immune system Antibodies transferred directly Antibodies induced by infection or by immunogens Passive immunity is due to readymade antibodiesActive immunity often involves both the cell-mediated and humoral immunity Types: Natural\u2014transfer of inapparent infection; Artificial\u2014induced by vaccines Immediate immunity; no lag period Immunity effective only after lag period Transient; less effective Durable; effective protectionNo immunological memory Immunological memory presentSubsequent dose less effective due to immune eliminationBooster effect on subsequent dose No negative phase Negative phase may occurApplicable even in immunodeficientNot applicable in immunodeficientTABLE 11-3 Differences between passive and active immunity Chap-11.indd 89 5/14/2012 1:27:21 PMAntigen12 Introduction Molecules that can be recognized by the immunoglobulin receptor of B cells or by the T-cell receptor when com plexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are called antigens. The word antigen is a shortened form of the words \"antibody generator.\" Antigens are substances that react with antibodies, while immunogens are molecules that induce an immune response. In most cases, antigens are immunogens, and the terms are used interchangeably. The antigens that are not immunogenic but can take part in immune reactions are termed as haptens. The term immunogenicity means the ability of an antigen to elicit an immune reaction in the form of a B-cell or T-cell response, whereas the term antigenicity means just the ability to combine specifically with the prod-ucts of the above responses. All molecules that are immuno-genic are antigenic too, but all antigenic molecules cannot be considered immunogenic. Thus, haptens can be said to lack immunogenicity. Determinants of Antigenicity A number of factors have been identified that make a substance immunogenic. Some of the important determinants of antige-nicity include: 1. Molecular size 2. Foreignness 3. Chemical-structural complexity 4. Stability 5. Other factors Molecular Size In general, protein molecules with large molecular weight are highly antigenic. Substances with molecular weights of about 100,000 Da and more are highly immunogenic, while substances with molecular weights of less than 5000 Da are generally not immunogenic. This property has been exploited in experimen-tal studies by using high molecular weight proteins like bovine gamma globulin (MW 150,000 Da) to induce an immune reac-tion. Substances with low molecular weight may be made anti-genic by adsorbing these on carrier particles, such as bentonite, kaolin, and other inert particles.Foreignness To be immunogenic, a molecule must be recognized as nonself, i.e., foreign. The molecule is considered self or nonself by the immune system depending on whether or not the molecule was exposed to the immune system during fetal development. Foreignness implies ability of the host to tolerate self- antigens. Tolerance to self-antigens develops by contact with them in the initial phases of the development of immune sys-tem, particularly during the development of lymphocytes. In general, the more distantly related two species are, the greater the immunogenicity of a molecule from one species will be when exposed to the other. For example, the bovine serum albumin is more immunogenic in a chicken than in a goat. A graft from an unrelated human will be rejected within about 2 weeks unless immunosuppressive drugs are used, but a graft from a chimpanzee will be rejected within hours even if drugs are used. In contrast, a kidney graft from an identical twin will be accepted readily. Chemical-Structural Complexity Proteins are the most potent immunogens followed by polysaccha-rides. Nucleic acids and lipids are not efficient in eliciting a good immune reaction, although they may act as haptens. Structural complexity of a protein contributes to its immunogenicity. Chains of single amino acids or single sugars are poorly immunogenic, but if different amino acids or sugars are combined in the same molecule, the immunogenicity is greatly enhanced. In cell-mediated immunity, the response of T cells to the peptide component of the proteins depends on how the pep-tide is recognized and presented by the MHC cells. Therefore, the structure of protein plays an important role in its immuno-genicity, especially in inducing cellular immunity. The lipid-specific antibodies are not easily produced; hence, they do not play a major role in immunity. However, these antibodies have a role in the measurement of certain lipid-based molecules and drugs. These antibodies are produced first by treat-ing lipids with haptens and then conjugating with suitable carrier molecules, such as the proteins (e.g., hemocyanin or bovine serum albumin). Stability Highly stable and nondegradable substances (e.g., some plastics, metals, or chains of D-amino acids) are not immunogenic. Chap-12.indd 90 5/14/2012 1:24:52 PMSection II Chapter 12ANTIGEN 91 This is because internalization, processing, and presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are always essential to mount an immune response. Therefore, very stable substances (such as silicon) have been successful as nonimmunogenic materials for reconstructive surgeries, such as breast implants. On the other hand, if a substance is very unstable, it may break up before an APC can be internalized, and hence become immunogenic. In addition, large, insoluble complexes are more immunogenic than smaller, soluble ones. This is because macrophages find it easier to phagocytose, degrade, and pres-ent the insoluble complexes than the soluble complexes. Other Factors Biological system Biological system also plays an important role in determining the immunological efficiency of an antigen. Some substances are immunogenic in one individual but not in others (i.e., responders and nonresponders). This is due to the fact that individuals may lack or have altered genes that code for the receptors for antigen on B cells and T cells, or they may not have the appropriate genes needed for the APC to present anti-gen to the helper T (T H) cells. Dosage and route of the antigen The dose of antigen and the route by which it comes into contact with the immune system also influence immunoge-nicity of the antigen. Very low doses of antigen do not stimu-late immune response, either because too few lymphocytes are contacted or because a nonresponsive state is elic-ited. Conversely, an extremely high dose also fails to elicit tolerance. Repeated administration of antigens (booster doses) may be required to enhance immune response of the host to certain antigens. This is particularly important in case of vac-cines where a prerequisite immune level needs to be attained. Hence the booster doses of vaccines, such as DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus), DT (Diphtheria, Tetanus), etc., are given to ensure good protective levels of antibodies. Generally, antigens are administered by the parenteral route to produce good level of antibodies. The antigens can be given by ( a) intravenous, (b) subcutaneous, (c) intradermal, (d) intramuscular, (e) intra-peritoneal, and (f) mucosal routes. Usually, the subcutaneous route of administration proves to be better than intravenous routes at eliciting an immune response. Adjuvants Adjuvants are the substances that when mixed with an anti-gen and injected with it boost the immunogenicity of the anti-gen. Adjuvants increase both the strength and the duration of immune response. Adjuvants boost immunogenicity of anti-gens in several ways: Adjuvants like aluminum potassium sulfate (alum) and Freund's water-in-oil adjuvant prolong the persistence of antigen by forming a depot at the injection site. Alum precipitates the antigen and releases it a little at a time. The water-in-oil emulsion forms small droplets with the antigen and also releases these slowly over time. Freund's complete adjuvant contains, in addition to the emulsifying factors, heat-killed mycobacteria. The bacterial components activate macrophages and increase both the production of IL-1 and the level of B7 membrane molecules, which enhances the immune response. The increased expression of class II MHC increases the ability of APC to present antigen to T H cells. B7 molecules on the APC bind to CD28, a cell-surface protein on TH cells, triggering costimulation, an enhancement of the T-cell immune response. Some adjuvants, like synthetic polyribonucleotides and bacterial lipopolysaccharides, stimulate nonspecific lym-phocyte proliferation and bring about their action. Antigenic Specificity Antigenic specificity of the antigen depends on antigenic determinants or epitopes. Epitopes An epitope is defined as the immunologically active region of an immunogen that binds to antigen-specific membrane recep-tors on lymphocytes or secreted antibodies. The interaction between cells of the immune system and antigens takes place at many levels and the complexity of any antigen is mirrored by its epitope. There are two types cells. B-cell epitope can combine with its receptor only if the antigen molecule is in its native state. The complementary surfaces of the antibody and the antigen molecules appear to be relatively flat. Smaller molecules often fit nicely within a particular depression or groove in the antigen-binding site of the antibody molecule. The B-cell epitope is about six or seven sugar residues or amino acids long. B-cell epitopes tend to be hydrophilic and are often located at bends in the protein structure. They are also often found in regions of proteins, which have a higher mobility; this may make it possible for an epitope to shift just a bit to fit into an almost-right site. T-cell epitopes T cells recognize amino acids in proteins but do not recognize polysaccharide or nucleic acid antigens. This is the reason why polysaccharides are considered as T-independent antigens and proteins as T-dependent antigens. The primary sequence of amino acids in proteins determines the antigenic determi-nants recognized by T cells. Free peptides are not recognized by T cells, while the complex of MHC molecules and peptide are recognized by T cells. Thus for a T-cell response, it should Chap-12.indd 91 5/14/2012 1:24:52 PMIMMUNOLOGY 92Section II Chapter 12 recognize both the antigenic determinant and also the MHC, and therefore it is said to be MHC restricted. In general, T-cell epitopes or antigenic determinants are small and are only 8-15 amino acids long. The antigenic deter-minants are limited to those parts of the antigen that can bind to MHC molecules. Since the MHC molecules are subjected to genetic variability, there can be difference among individuals in their T-cell response to the same stimulus. Each MHC molecule can bind several, but not all, peptides. Therefore, for a peptide to be immunogenic in a particular individual, that individual must have MHC molecules that can bind to it. Key Points Processing of an antigen by APCs is absolutely essential for a T cell to recognize it. Two different types of processing can pre-pare a protein antigen for antigen presentation. These include: Externally derived antigens' processing: In this process, phagocytosed bacteria are killed and lysed by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages. Pieces of the bacteria are then processed and presented in the context of class II MHC molecules. Endogenously derived antigens' processing: In this pro- cess, virus proteins synthesized in a cell are processed and then presented in the context of class I MHC molecules. Species Specificity Tissues of all individuals in a species possess certain species-specific antigens. However, some degree of cross-reaction occurs between antigens from related species. The species specificity shows phylogenetic relationship. The phylogenetic relationship is useful in: Tracing evolutionary relationship between species. The species identification from blood and seminal stains in forensic medicine. Isospecificity Isospecificity is determined by the presence of isoantigens or histocompatibility antigens. Isoantigens Isoantigens are antigens found in some, but not all, members of a species. A species may be grouped depending on the pres-ence of different isoantigens in its members. These are geneti-cally determined. Human erythrocyte antigens, based on which individuals are classified into different blood groups, are the best examples of isoantigens in humans. The blood groups are of primary importance in: Transfusion of blood and blood products, Isoimmunization during pregnancy, and Providing valuable evidence in paternity disputes, the results of which are supplemented by m ore recent DNA fingerprinting tests. Histocompatibility Antigens Histocompatibility antigens are the cellular determinants specific for each individual of a species. These antigens are associated with the plasma membrane of tissue cells. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is the major histocom-patibility antigen that determines the homograft rejection. Therefore, HLA typing is absolutely essential before carrying out transplantation of tissue or organ from one individual to another. Autospeci city Self-antigens are generally nonantigenic. Sequestrated antigens (such as eye lens protein and sperm) are, however, exceptions, because these are not recognized as self-antigens. This is because corneal tissue and sperm are never encountered by the immune system during the development of tolerance to self-antigens. Therefore, these tissues become immunogenic if accidentally or experimentally released into the blood or tissues. Organ Speci city Antigens characteristic of an organ or tissues are called organ-specific antigens. These antigens found in the brain, kidney, and lens tissues, even of different animal species, share the same antigen specificity. Organ-specific antigens, such as brain-specific antigens, shared by human and sheep brain are one such example. The antirabies vaccines prepared from sheep brain, when given, may induce immune response in some humans, causing damage to neural tissues of the recipient. This may result in neuroparalytic complications in some individuals. Heterophile Speci city Heterophile specificity is determined by the presence of heterophile antigens. The same or closely related antigens, sometimes present in tissues of different biological spe-cies, classes, or kingdoms are known as heterophile antigens . Antibodies against the heterophile antigens produced by one of the species cross-react with the antigens of other species. This property is exploited for diagnosis of many infectious diseases. Weil-Felix reaction, Paul-Bunnell test, and cold agglutination tests are the examples of serological tests that use such heterophile antigens. Chap-12.indd 92 PMSection II Chapter 12ANTIGEN 93 Key Points Weil-Felix reaction is a test used for diagnosis of rickettsial infections, in which the strains of Proteus species (such as OX 19, OX 2, and OX K) are used to detect hetero-phile antibodies produced against rickettsial pathogens. Paul-Bunnell test is used for diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection by demonstration of heterophile antibodies that agglutinate sheep erythrocytes. Cold agglutinin test is performed for diagnosis of primary atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae by demonstration of heterophilic antibodies. Haptens Haptens are small organic molecules that are antigenic but not immunogenic. They are not immunogenic because they can-not activate helper T cells. Failure of hapten to activate helper T cells is due to their inability to bind to MHC proteins; they cannot bind because they are not proteins and only proteins can be presented by MHC proteins. Moreover, haptens are univalent hence cannot activate B cells by themselves. The haptens, however, can activate B cells when covalently bound to a \"carrier\" protein. When bound with a carrier mol-ecule, they form an immunogenic hapten-carrier conjugate (Fig. 12-1). In this process, the haptens combine with an IgM receptor on the B cells, and the hapten-carrier protein complex is internalized. A peptide of the carrier protein is presented in association with class II MHC protein to the helper T cells. The activated helper T cells then produce interleukins, which stimulate the B cells to produce antibodies to hapten. Animals immunized with such a conjugate produce anti- bodies specific for (a) the hapten determinant, (b) unaltered epitopes on the carrier protein, and (c) new epitopes formed by combined parts of both the hapten and carrier. In fact, the hap-ten-carrier molecule is bound to surface immunoglobulins on B cells via the hapten epitopes. The hapten-carrier molecule is then taken in, processed, and pieces of the carrier are presented by these B cells and T H cells. In the body, the formation of hap- ten-carrier conjugates is the basis for development of allergic responses to drugs, such as penicillin. Superantigens Superantigens are a class of molecules that can interact with APCs and T lymphocytes in a nonspecific way. The superan-tigens act differently by interacting with MHC class II mol-ecules of the APC and the Vb domain of the T-lymphocyte receptor. This interaction results in the activation of a larger number of T cells (10%) than conventional antigens (1%), lead-ing to massive immunomodulation. Examples are staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome exfoliative toxins, and also PMAntibodies13 Introduction globulin proteins (immunoglobulins) that are synthesized in serum and tissue fluids, which react specifically with the antigen that stimulated their production. Three types of globulins are present in the blood: alpha, beta, and gamma. The antibodies are the gamma globulins. Antibodies are one of the major plasma proteins, and against infection often referred to as \"first line of defense\". The most important func-tion of antibodies is to confer protection against microbial pathogens. Antibodies confer protection in the following ways: 1. They prevent attachment of microbes to mucosal surfaces of the host. 2. They reduce virulence of microbes by neutralizing toxins and viruses. 3. They facilitate phagocytosis by opsonization of microbes. 4. They activate complement, leading to complement-mediated activities against microbes. Von Behring and Kit asato performed the first experiments that proved the physical existence of antibodies in 1890. They demonstrated that serum obtained from rabbits immunized with tetanus or diphtheria toxins could prevent disease in mice infected with such pathogens. The unknown substance that was present in serum and that provided protection on transfer was named \"antitoxin\" by Tizzoni and Cattani in 1891. Subsequently, experimental works by Paul Ehrlich and Jules Bordet demonstrated that a protective response could be generated even against whole cells (erythrocytes). The more inclusive term antibody subsequently replaced the term antitoxin. Tiselius and Kabat accomplished the first successful attempt to identify antibody molecules in 1939. They demon-strated that hyperimmunization increased the concentration of /H9253-globulins in serum and that this fraction contained anti- body activity. Because /H9253-globulins are large-molecular-weight proteins, it was suggested that further characterization of anti-bodies requires breaking them into smaller and easily handled fragments. Porter in 1959, succeeded in digesting rabbit immunoglobu- lin G (IgG) with the proteolytic enzyme papain. These produced two distinct fragments: a monovalent fragment with antigen-binding activity, termed Fab (fragment antigen binding) and a second fragment that retained the antibody's effector functions and crystallized readily into a lattice, termed Fc (fragment crys-tallizable). Edelman and Poulik using a similar method splitted myeloma globulins into two distinct components, which subse-quently were termed heavy (H) and light (L) chains. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 1964 coined the term \"immunoglobulin (Ig)\" for the term antibody. The immunoglobulin includes not only antibody globulins but also the cryoglobulins, macroglobulins, and abnormal myeloma proteins. Thus, all antibodies are immunoglobulins but not all immunoglobulins may be antibodies. Immunoglobulins There are five classes of immunoglobulins: (i) immunoglobulin G (IgG), (ii) immunoglobulin M (IgM), (iii) immunoglobulin A (IgA), (iv) immunoglobulin E (IgE), and (v) immunoglobulin D (IgD). Myeloma proteins were first used for the amino acid sequencing of immunoglobulins. These proteins were also the first immunoglobulins that were subjected to crystallographic studies. They provided the first glimpses of the domain struc-ture of the prototypic immunoglobulin. Structure of Immunoglobulins Immunoglobulins show the following properties: They are glycoproteins. They are a complex structure of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy (typically 55 kDa each) chains and two identical light chains (25 kDa each). This gives immuno-globulin an overall 'Y' or 'T' shape, which is the most widely recognized feature of immunoglobulin structure. The terms \"heavy\" and \"light\" refer to the molecular weights of the chains. The heavy chains have a molecu-lar weight of 50,000-70,000 Da, while light chains have a molecular weight of 25,000 Da. The heavy chains are longer, and light chains are shorter (Fig. 13-1). Heavy chains An immunoglobulin molecule has two heavy chains. Each heavy chain is made up of 420-440 amino acids. The two heavy chains are held together by one to five disulfide (S\u2014S) bonds. Each heavy chain is bound to a light chain by a disulfide bond and by noncovalent bonds, such as salt linkages, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic bonds to form a heterodimer (H-L). Similar noncovalent interactions and disulfide bridges link the two identical heavy and light (H-L) chains to each other to form the basic four-chain (H-L) 2 antibody structure. Chap-13.indd 94 5/14/2012 1:23:11 PMSection II Chapter 13ANTIBODIES 95 The heavy chains of a given antibody molecule determine the class of that antibody. For example, IgM contains mu (/H9262), IgG contains gamma (/H9253), IgA contains alpha (/H9251), IgD contains delta (/H9254), and IgE contains epsilon (/H9255) heavy chains (Table 13-1). These heavy chains are structurally and antigenically distinct for each class of immunoglobulin. They differ in their size, car-bohydrate content, and as antigens. Light chains An immunoglobulin molecule has two light chains. Each light chain is made up of 220-240 amino acids. Light chain is attached to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond. The light chains are structurally and chemically similar in all classes of immunoglobulins. They are of two types: kappa ( /H9260) and lambda (/H9261 ). These two types differ in their amino acids present in constant regions. Each immunoglobulin has either two /H9260 or two /H9261 chains but never both. The /H9260 and /H9261 chains are present in human serum in a ratio of 2:1. Variable and constant regions Each polypeptide chain of an immunoglobulin molecule con-tains an amino terminal part and a carboxy terminal part. The amino terminal part is called the variable region (V region) and the carboxy terminal part is called the constant region (C region). Both heavy and light chains contain variable and constant regions. These regions are composed of three-dimensional folded structures with repeating segments, which are called domains. Each heavy chain consists of one variable (VH) and three constant (CH) domains. IgG and IgA have three CH domains (CH1, CH2, and CH3), whereas IgM and IgE have four domains (CH1, CH2, CH3, and CH4). Each light chain consists of one variable (VL) and one constant domain (CL).Variable region: The amino-terminal half of the light or heavy chain, consisting of 100-110 amino acids, is known as vari-able or V regions (VL in light chains and VH in heavy chains). V region is different for each class of immunoglobulin. The variable regions of both light and heavy chains consist of three highly variable regions known as hypervariable regions . The antigen combining sites Fab of the antibody molecule that consists of only 5-10 amino acids each are present in the hypervariable region of both the light and heavy chains. These antigen-binding sites are responsible for specific bind-ing of antibodies with antigens. The high specificity of anti-bodies is primarily due to the presence of these hypervariable regions.Constant region: The carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule is called the constant (C) region. It consists of two basic amino acid sequences. The Fc fragment, found to crystallize under low ionic conditions, is present in the constant region of heavy chain. The constant region of the heavy chain has many biological functions. It is responsible for activation of the complement, binding to cell surface receptors, placental transfer, and many other biological activities. The constant region of the light chain has no biological function. A single antibody molecule has two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, H2L2, or a multiple (H2L2) n of this basic four-chain structure. Subisotypes exist for /H9251 and /H9253 chains, and this leads to the existence of subclasses of the respective immunoglobulins. Treatment of Immunoglobulins with Proteolytic Enzymes The immunoglobulin molecule can be broken into a number of \"sections\" or \"fragments\" by action of proteolytic papain cleaves just above the interchain disulfide the heavy chains, whereas the enzyme pepsin cleaves just below these bonds, thereby generating different digestion products. For example, peptide bonds in the \"hinge\" region are broken on treatment of antibody molecule with papain, resulting in production of two iden-tical Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. The Fab frag-ments produced during cleavage monovalently bind to the antigen. Treatment with pepsin cleaves immunoglobulin but at a different site, producing an Fc fragment and two Fab fragments, F (ab) 2, which upon exposure to reducing conditions are separated into Fab monomeric units. Immunoglobulin Antigen Determinants There are three major deter-minants: FIG. 13-1. Schematic diagram of monomer of IgG Gamma None IgD Delta NoneTABLE PM96 The isotype of an immunoglobulin refers to the particular con- stant region of the light- or heavy-chain of the immunoglob-ulin. Immunoglobulins are classified on the basis of various heavy chain isotypes. Heavy chains are distinguished by the presence of heavy chain markers, such as /H9262, /H9253, /H9251, /H9254, and /H9255 in the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. The light chains are also distinguished by isotype markers, such as /H9260 and /H9261. Isotypes are present in all members of a species. Allotypes The allotype refers to allelic differences in both the variable and constant regions of immunoglobulin. The allotype markers are present on the constant regions of light and heavy chains. They are Am on /H9251 heavy chains, Gm on /H9253 heavy chains, and Km on /H9260 light chains. Allotype markers are absent on /H9262, /H9254, and /H9255 heavy chains and on /H9261 light chains. More than 25 Gm types,3 Km allotypes, and 2 Am on IgA have been described. Allotypes are present in some but not all members of a species and are inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion. Idiotypes The idiotype refers to a specificity that is associated with the variable region. Idiotype markers are found on the hypervari-able region of the immunoglobulin. Idiotypes are specific for each antibody molecule. Anti-idiotypic antibodies produced against Fab fragments prevent antigen-antibody interaction. Biosynthesis of Immunoglobulins B lymphocytes and plasma cells take part in the synthesis of immunoglobulins. Resting B cells synthesize only small amounts of immunoglobulins that mainly get incorporated into cell membranes. Plasma cells, the most differentiated B cells, are specialized to produce and secrete large amounts of immunoglobulins. The synthetic capacity of the plasma cells is reflected by the abundant cytoplasm, which is extremely rich in endoplasmic reticulum. Normally, heavy and light chains are synthesized in sepa- rate polyribosomes of the plasma cell. The amounts of heavy and light chains synthesized on the polyribosomes are usually balanced and so both types of chains are combined to produce complete Ig molecules, without excess of any given chain. The assembly of a complete Ig molecule is carried out either by asso-ciating one heavy and one light chain to form an H-L hemi-molecule, and then joining two H-L hemi-molecules to form a single complete molecule (H2L2), or by forming H2 and L2 dimers that later associate to form the complete molecule. While free light chains can be effectively secreted from plasma cells, free heavy chains are generally not secreted. The heavy chains are synthesized and transported to the endo-plasmic reticulum, where they are glycosylated, but secretion requires combination with light chains to form a complete immunoglobulin molecule. If light chains are not synthe-sized or heavy chains are synthesized in excess, the free heavy chains combine through their CH1 domain with a heavy-chain-binding protein, which is believed to be responsible for their intracytoplasmic retention. Both IgM and IgA are the polymeric antibodies, which have one additional polypeptide chain, the J chain. The J chain is synthesized by all plasma cells, including those that produce IgG. However, it is only incorporated to polymeric forms of IgM and IgA. It is believed that the J chain has some role in initiating polymerization. IgM proteins are assembled in two steps. First, the monomeric units are assembled. Then, five monomers and one J chain combine via covalent bonds to produce a pentam-eric molecule. Metabolism of Immunoglobulins Half-life (T 1/2) of immunoglobulin is one of the most com-monly used parameters to assess the catabolic rate of immu-noglobulins. The half-life corresponds to the time elapsed for a reduction to half of a circulating immunoglobulin concentration after equilibrium has been reached. This is usu-ally determined by injecting an immunoglobulin labeled with a radioisotope ( 131I). The IgG is the immunoglobulin class with the longest half- life (average of 21 days), with the exception of IgG3. The IgG3 has a considerably shorter half-life (average of 7 days) that is nearer to that of IgA (5-6 days) and IgM (5 days). The synthesis rate of IgA1 (24 mg/kg/day) is not very different from that of IgG1 (25 mg/kg/day), but the serum concentra-tion of IgA1 is about one-third of the IgG1 concentration. This is explained by a fractional turnover rate three-times greater for IgA1 (24%/day). The highest fractional turnover rate and shorter half-life are those of IgE (74%/day and 2.4 days, respec-tively). The lowest synthesis rate is that of IgE (0.002 mg/kg/day,compared to 20-60 mg/kg/day for IgG). Immunoglobulin Classes The structure and biological functions of five classes of immu-noglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD) are described below: Immunoglobulin G IgG is a 7S immunoglobulin with a molecular weight of 150,000 Da. It has a half-life of 23 days\u2014longest among all the immunoglobulins. Other properties of the IgG are given in Table 13-2. IgG is the most abundant class of immunoglobulins in the serum, comprising about 80% of the IgG1, numbered according to their decreasing concentra-tions in serum. Though the differences between these subclasses are minute, their functions vary as follows: 1. IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 are special because these are the only immunoglobulins with the ability to cross the placen-tal barrier . They play an important role in protecting the developing fetus against infections. 2. IgG3, IgG1, and IgG2, in order of their efficiency, are ef fective in the activation of the complement. Chap-13.indd 96 5/14/2012 1:23:12 PMSection II Chapter 13ANTIBODIES 97 3. IgG1 and IgG3 bind with high affinity to Fc receptors on phagocytic cells and thus mediate opsonization. IgG4 has an intermediate aff inity for Fc receptors and IgG2 has an extremely low affinity. Two /H9253 chains, along with two /H9260 or /H9253 light chains, joined together by disulfide bonds, comprise an IgG molecule as follows: The /H9253 chain is a 51-kDa, 450-amino acid residue heavy polypeptide chain. It consists of one variable VH domain and a constant (C) region with three domains designated CH1, CH2, and CH3. The hinge region is situated between CH1 and CH2. Proteolytic enzymes, such as papain and pepsin, cleave an IgG molecule in the hinge region to produce Fab and F (ab\u00b4) 2 and Fc fragments. There are four subclasses of IgG in humans show differences in their hinge regions and differ in the number and position of disulfide bonds that link two /H9253 chains in each IgG molecule. There is only a 5% difference in amino acid sequence among human /H9253 chain isotypes, exclusive of the hinge region. Cysteine resi- dues, which make it possible for interheavy ( /H9253) chain disulfide bonds to form are found in the hinge area. IgG1 and IgG4 have two interheavy chain disulfide bonds, IgG2 has 4, and IgG3 has 11. The IgG, is distributed equally in the intra- and extra-vascular compartments.Key Points IgG shows the following biological activities: In response to infection, IgG antibodies appear late after appearance of IgM antibodies, but persists for a longer period. It confers protection against the microorganisms that are present in the blood and tissues. It is distributed equally in the intra- and extravascular compartments. It is the only immunoglobulin that crosses the pla-centa; hence, it confers natural passive immunity to the newborns. It takes part in precipitation, complement fixation, and neutralization of toxins and viruses. It binds to microorganisms and facilitates the process of phagocytosis of microorganisms. Immunoglobulin M IgM constitutes about 5-8% of total serum immunoglobulins. It is distributed mainly intravascularly. It is a heavy molecule (19S) with a molecular weight varying from 900,000 to 1,000,000 Da (millionaire molecule). It has a half-life of 5 days (Table 13-2). IgM is basically a pentamer, composed of five immuno- globulin subunits (monomeric subunits, IgMs) and one molecule of J chain. Each monomeric IgM is composed of two light chains (/H9260 or /H9253 light chains) and two heavy chains ( /H9262). The heavy chains are larger than those of IgG by about 20,000 Da, corresponding to an extra domain on the constant region Characteristics IgG IgA IgM IgD IgE Structure Blood, lymph, and intestineBlood, lymph, and B cell surfaceSecretions B cell surface, blood, and lymphBound to mast and basophil cell Sedimentation coefficient 77 1 9 7 8 Molecular weight (kDa) 150 160 900 180 190 Carbohydrate (%) 3 8 12 13 12 Serum concentration (mg/mL)12 2 1.2 0.03 0.00004 Half-life (days) /H9254/H9260 or /H9254/H9260 or /H9254 Complement binding Classical pathway Alternate pathway Classical pathway None None Placental transport /H11001/H11002 Heterologous None None HomologousTABLE 13-2 Comparison of immunoglobulins PM98 subclasses of IgM (IgM1 and IgM2) are described, which differ in their /H9262 chains. IgM1 consists of /H9262 1 and IgM2 consists of /H92622 chains (Fig. 13-2). The immunoglobulin /H9262 chain is a 72 kDa, 570-amino acid heavy polypeptide chain comprising one variable region, des-ignated VH, and a four-domain constant region, designated CH1, CH2, CH3, and CH4. The /H9262 chain does not have a hinge region. A \"tail piece\" is located at the carboxy terminal end of the chain. It comprises 18-amino acid residues. A cysteine resi-due at the penultimate position of a carboxy terminal region of the /H9262 chain forms a disulfide bond that joins to the J chain. There are five N-linked oligosaccharides in the /H9262 chain of humans. Monomeric IgM, with a molecular weight of 180,000 Da, is expressed as membrane-bound antibody on B cells. As mentioned earlier, the J chain found in the IgM molecule was believed to play a major role in the secretion of its polymer-ized form. Being present on the membrane of B cells, IgM acts as the antigen-binding molecule in the antigen-antibody complex. Because of its pentameric structure with 10 antigen- binding sites, serum IgM has a higher valency than the other isotypes. An IgM molecule can bind 10 small hapten molecules; however, because of steric hindrance, only five or fewer molecules of larger antigens can be bound simultaneously. Treatment of serum with 2-mercaptoethanol destroys IgM without affecting IgG antibodies. This forms the basis for differential estimation of IgM and IgG antibodies in serum pre-treated with 2-mercaptoethanol.Key Points IgM shows the following biological activities: Pentameric IgM, because of its high valency, is more effi-cient than other isotypes in binding antigens with many repeating epitopes, such as viral particles and red blood cells. It is more efficient than IgG in activating complement. Complement activation requires two Fc regions in close proximity, and the pentameric structure of a single mol-ecule of IgM fulfills this requirement. IgM is the first immunoglobulin produced in a primary response to an antigen. The immunoglobulin confers pro-tection against invasion of blood by microbial pathogens. Deficiency of IgM antibodies is associated with septicemia. IgM antibodies are short lived and disappear early as com-pared to IgG. The presence of IgM antibody in serum, therefore, indicates recent infection. It is also the first immunoglobulin to be synthesized by a neonate in about 20 weeks of age. IgM is not transported across the placenta; hence, the presence of IgM in the fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection. The detection of IgM antibodies in serum, therefore, is useful for the diagnosis of congenital infections, such as syphilis, rubella, toxoplasmosis, etc. Immunoglobulin A IgA is the serum immunoglobulin, comprising nearly 10-15% of serum immunoglobulin. It has a half-life of 6-8 days (Table 13-2). IgA consist of /H9251 heavy chain that confers class specificity on IgA molecules. The /H9251 chain is a 58-kDa, 470-amino acid residue heavy polypeptide chain. The chain is divisible into three con-stant domains, designated CH1, CH2, and CH3, and one vari-able domain, designated VH. Hinge region is situated between CH1 and CH2 domains. An additional segment of 18-amino acid residues at the penultimate position of the chain contains a cysteine residue where the J chain can be attached through a disulfide bond. IgA occurs in two forms: serum IgA and secre-tory IgA.Serum IgA: It is present in the serum and is a monomeric 7S molecule with a molecular weight of 60,000 Da. It has a half-life of 6-8 days. It has two subclasses, and chain has two allotypes, A2m (1) and A2m (2), and does not have disulfide bonds linking heavy to light chains. Differences in the two /H9251 chains are found in two CH1 and five CH3 posi- tions. Thus, there are three varieties of /H9251 -heavy chains in humans.Secretory IgA: It is a dimer or tetramer and consists of a J-chain polypeptide and a polypeptide chain called secretory component, or SC, or secretory piece (Fig. 13-3). The SC is a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 70,000 Da and is pro-duced by epithelial cells of mucous membranes. It consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains that bind to the Fc region domains of the IgA dimer. This interaction is stabilized by a disulfide bond between the fifth domain of the SC and one IgM IgM is pentameric. It is an effective first line defenseagainst foreign bodies.IgM is produced in theprimary immune response IgG is monomeric. givesprotection against intestinalparasites and is responsible formany of symptoms of allergyIgE IgA dimeric. It mucosal surfacesIgA 98 5/14/2012 1:23:12 PMSection II Chapter 13ANTIBODIES 99 of the chains of the dimeric IgA. IgA-secreting plasma cells are concentrated along mucous membrane surfaces. The daily production of secretory IgA is greater than that of any other immunoglobulin. Secretory IgA is the major immunoglobu-lin present in external secretions, such as breast milk, saliva, tears, and mucus of the bronchial, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. IgA activates the complement not by classical pathway but by alternative pathway. Key Points Secretory IgA shows the following biological activities: It protects the mucous membranes against microbial patho- gens. It serves an important effector function at mucous membrane surfaces, which are the main entry sites for most pathogenic organisms. Because it is polymeric, secretory IgA can cross-link large antigens with multiple epitopes. Binding of secretory IgA to bacterial and viral surface antigens prevents attachment of the pathogens to the mucosal cells, thus inhibiting viral infection and bacterial colonization. Complexes of secretory IgA and antigen are easily entrapped in mucus and then eliminated by the ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract or by peristalsis of the gut. Breast milk contains secretory IgA and many other mol-ecules that protect the newborns against infection during the first month of life. Because the immune system of infants is not fully functional, breast-feeding plays an important role in maintaining the health of newborns. Secretory IgA has shown to provide an important line of defense against bacteria (such as Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, and Nei sseria gonorrhoeae) and viruses (such as polio, influenza, and reovirus). Immunoglobulin E IgE constitutes less than 1% of the total immunoglobu-lin pool. It is present in serum in a very low concentration (0.3 /H9262g/mL). It is mostly found extravascularly in lining of the respiratory and intestinal tracts. IgE is an 8S molecule with a molecular weight of 190,000 Da and half-life of 2-3 days. Unlike other immunoglobulins that are heat stable, IgE is a heat-labile protein\u2014easily inactivated at 56\u00b0C in 1 hour (Table 13-2). Two e heavy polypeptide chains, along with two /H9260 or two /H9261 light chains, fastened together by disulfide bonds, comprise an IgE molecule. The e chain is a 72-kDa, 550-amino acid residue polypeptide chain. It consists of one variable region, designated VH, and a four-domain constant region, designated CH1, CH2, CH3, and CH4. This heavy chain does not possess a hinge region. In humans, the /H9255 heavy chain has 428 amino acid residues in the constant region (Fig. 13-4). IgE does not cross the placenta or fix the complement. Key Points IgE shows the following biological activities: IgE is also known as reaginic antibody that mediates the type I immediate hypersensitivity (atopy) reactions. IgE is responsible for the symptoms of hay fever, asthma, and anaphylactic shock. IgE binds to Fc receptors on the membranes of blood basophils and tissue mast cells. Cross-linkage of receptor bound IgE molecules by antigen (allergen) induces basophils and mast cells to translocate their granules to the plasma membrane and release their contents to the extracellular environment\u2014a process known as degranulation. As a result, varieties of pharma-cologically active mediators are released and give rise to allergic manifestations. Localized mast-cell degranulation induced by IgE may also release mediators that facilitate a buildup of various cells necessary for antiparasitic defense. Immunoglobulin D IgD comprises less than 1% of serum immunoglobulins. It is a 7S monomer with a molecular weight of 180,000 Da. The half-life of IgD is only 2-3 days (Table 13-2). IgD has the basic four-chain monomeric structure with two /H9254 heavy chains (molecular weight 63,000 Da each) and either two /H9260 or two /H9261 light chains (molecular weight 22,000 Da each) (Table 13-2). Immunoglobulin /H9254 chain is a 64-kDa, 500-amino acid residue heavy polypeptide chain consisting of one variable region, designated as VH, and a three-domain constant region, designated as CH1, CH2, and CH3. There is also a 58-residue amino acid residue hinge region in human /H9254 chains. Two exons encode the hinge region. IgD is very susceptible to the action of proteolytic enzymes at its hinge region. Two separate exons Heavy chainLight chain Disulfide bondJ bondsConstant IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 13encode /H9254 chain. A distinct exon encodes the carboxy terminal portion of the human /H9254 chain that is secreted. The human /H9254 chain contains three N-linked oligosaccharides. Table 13-3 summarizes roles of various immunoglobulins in human defense. Key Points IgD is present on the surface of B lymphocytes and both IgD and IgM serve as recognition receptors for antigens. The role of IgD in immunity continues to remain elusive. Abnormal Immunoglobulins Abnormal immunoglobulins are other structurally similar proteins that are found in serum in certain pathological condi-tions, such as multiple myeloma, heavy chain disease, and cryo-globulinemia and sometimes in healthy individuals also.Multiple myeloma: Bence-Jones (BJ) proteins were the earliest abnormal proteins described in 1847 that were found in patients with multiple myeloma. These proteins are the light chains of immunoglobulins, hence occur as either /H9260 or /H9261 forms. In a patient, it may occur as either /H9260 or /H9261 but never in both the forms. BJ proteins have a peculiar property of coagulating at 60\u00b0C and redissolving again at a higher tem-perature of 80\u00b0C.IgG IgM IgA IgD IgE Enhances phagocytosis Especially effective against microorganisms and agglutinating antigensLocalized protection on mucosal surfacesSerum function not known Allergic reaction Neutralizes toxins and viruses First antibody produced in response to initial infectionPresent on B cells; and function in initiation of immune responsePossibly lysis of parasitic worms Protects fetus and newbornTABLE 13-3 Role of immunoglobulins in human defense In multiple myeloma, plasma cells synthesizing IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE are affected. Myeloma involving IgM-producing plasma cells is known as Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. This condition is characterized by excessive production of the respective myeloma proteins (M proteins) and that of their light chains (BJ proteins). The study of myeloma proteins led to a great advancement in our understanding of immunoglobulin function. These \"single\" or \"monoclonal\" antibodies obtained from the sera of patients with multiple myeloma were used in many of the serologic and biochemical studies of the 1950s and 1960s. They remained the major source of homogeneous immuno-globulins until the development of the hybridoma in 1974. The serologists injected them into animals and produced antisera that were used to study some of the basic properties of antibod-ies. For example, the immune sera were absorbed with other myeloma proteins and were used to identify isotypic, allotypic, and idiotypic specificities.Heavy chain disease: Heavy chain disease is a different disor-der, which is a lymphoid neoplasia, characterized by an excess production of heavy chains of the immunoglobulins.Cryoglobulinemia: Cryoglobulinemia is a condition charac-terized by presence of cryoglobulins in blood. The condition may not be always associated with disease but is often found in patients with macroglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythe-matosus, and myelomas. Most cryoglobulins consist of either IgG or IgM or their mixed precipitates. In cryoglobulinemia, serum from patient precipitates on on warming. Chap-13.indd 100 5/14/2012 1:23:13 PMAntigen-Antibody Reactions 14 Introduction The interactions between antigens and antibodies are known as antigen-antibody reactions. The reactions are highly specific, and an antigen reacts only with antibodies produced by itself or with closely related antigens. Since these reactions are essentially spe-cific, they have been used in many diagnostic tests for the detec-tion of either the antigen or the antibody in vitro. The antigen and antibody reactions also form the basis of immunity against microbial diseases in vivo. In the host, it may cause tissue injury in hypersensitivity reactions and in autoimmune diseases. General Features ofAntigen-Antibody Reactions Antigen and antibody bind through noncovalent bonds in a manner similar to that in which proteins bind to their cellular receptors, or enzymes bind to their substrates. But antigen-antibody reactions differ from the latter as there is no irreversible chemical alteration in either of the participants, i.e., antigen or the antibody. The antigen and antibody binding is reversible and can be prevented or dissociated by high ionic strength or extreme pH. Following are some of the general features of these interactions: Physicochemical Properties Electrostatic bonds, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals bonds, and hydrophobic interactions are the intermolecular forces involved in antigen-antibody reactions. All these types of intermolecular forces depend on the close proximity of the antigen and antibody molecules. For that reason, the \"good fit\" between an antigenic determinant and an antibody-combining site determines the stability of the antigen-antibody reaction. Multiple bonding between the antigen and the antibody ensures that the antigen will be bound tightly to the antibodies. Affinity Affinity denotes the intensity of attraction between antigen and antibody. Low-affinity antibodies bind antigen weakly and tend to dis-sociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies bind antigen more tightly and remain bound longer. High-affinity binding is believed to result from a very close fit between the antigen-binding sites and the corresponding antigenic determinants that facilitates development of strong noncovalent interactions between antigen and antibody. Avidity Avidity is a measure of the overall strength of binding of an antigen with many antigenic determinants and multiva-lent antibodies. Avidity is a better indicator of the strength of interactions in real biological systems than affinity. Therefore, the avidity of an antigen-antibody reaction is dependent on the valencies of both antigens and antibodies and is greater than the sum total of individual affinities. Specificity The term specificity refers to the ability of an individual antibody- combining site to react with only one antigenic determinant or the ability of a population of antibody molecules to react with only one antigen. Antigen-antibody reactions usually show a high degree of specificity. Key Points Antibodies can specifically recognize differences in: primary structure of an antigen, isomeric forms of an antigen, and secondary and tertiary structure of an antigen. Despite this, cross-reactions between antigens and antibodies, however, do occur and are sometimes responsible for causing diseases in hosts and for causing false results in diagnostic tests. Cross-Reactivity Although antigen-antibody reactions are highly specific, in some cases antibody elicited by one antigen can cross-react with an unrelated antigen. Such cross-reactivity occurs if two different antigens share an identical or very similar epitope. In the latter case, the antibody's affinity for the cross-reacting epi-tope is usually less than that for the original epitope. Antisera containing polyclonal antibodies can often be found to cross-react with immunogens partially related to those used for immunization, due to the existence of common epitopes or of epitopes with similar configurations. Chap-14.indd Chapter 14Stages Reactions The antigen-antibody reaction occurs in two stages: primary and secondary. Primary Stage Primary stage is the initial interaction between antigen and antibody. It is rapid and reversible, but without any visible effects. The ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions are the weaker intermo-lecular forces that bind antigen and antibodies together in this primary stage. Covalent binding, which is a stronger intermolecular force between antigen and antibody, however, does not occur in this stage. Secondary Stage Secondary stage is an irreversible interaction between anti-gen and antibody, with visible effects, such as agglutination, precipitation, neutralization, complement fixation, and immobilization of motile organisms. The binding between antigen and antibody during this stage occurs by covalent binding. A single antibody is capable of causing different types of antigen-antibody reactions, and a single antigen is capable of inducing production of different classes of immunoglobulins, which differ in their biological properties. The results of agglutination, precipitation, neutralization, and other tests are usually expressed as a titer. Titer is defined as the highest dilution of serum that gives a positive reaction in test. Higher titer means greater level of antibodies in serum. For example, a serum with a titer of 1/128 contains more antibodies than a serum with a titer of 1/8. Types of Antigen-Antibody Reactions Serological tests are widely used for detection of either serum antibodies or antigens for diagnosis of a wide variety of infectious diseases (Table 14-1). These serological tests are also used for diagnosis of autoimmune diseases and in typing of blood and tissues before transplantation. The following are the examples of antigen-antibody reactions: (a) precipitation, (b) agglutination, (c) complement-dependent serological tests, test, ) (g) enzyme chemiluminescence assay, and (k) immunoelec- tronmicroscopic tests. Precipitation Precipitation test shows the following features: It is a type of antigen-antibody reaction, in which the antigen occurs in a soluble form. It is a test in which antibody interacts with the soluble antigen in the presence of electrolyte at a specified pH and temperature to produce a precipitate. A lattice is formed between the antigens and antibodies; in certain cases, it is visible as an insoluble precipitate. Antibodies that aggregate soluble antigens are called precipitins. Test Uses Flocculation test Detection of reaginic antibodies in syphilis by VDRL test Radial immunodiffusion Detection of fungal antigen and antibodies Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis Detection of both antigen and antibodies in bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases Slide agglutination test Identification of bacterial isolates, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, etc. Tube agglutination test Detection of antibodies in bacterial infections, e.g., Widal test for enteric fever Latex agglutination test Quantitation and detection of antigen and antibodies Hemagglutination test Detection of both antigens and antibodies in viral and parasitic infections Coagglutination test Detection of microbial antigens Complement fixation test Quantitation and detection of antibodies Direct immunofluorescence test Detection and localization of antigen in a cell or tissue Indirect immunofluorescence test Detection of specific antibodies in the serum Sandwich ELISA Detection of antigens and antibodies Indirect ELISA Quantitation and detection of antibodies Radioimmunoassay Quantitation of hormones, drugs, etc. Western blot Detection of antigen-specific antibodyTABLE 14-1 Commonly used tests in clinical microbiology Chap-14.indd 102 5/14/2012 11:56:53 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 103 instead of sedimenting, the precipitate remains sus-pended as floccules, the reaction is known as flocculation. Formation of an antigen-antibody lattice depends on the valency of both the antibody and antigen. The antibody must be bivalent; a precipitate will not form with monovalent Fab fragments. The antigen must be either bivalent or polyvalent; that is, it must have at least two copies of the same epitope, or have different epitopes that react with different antibodies present in polyclonal antisera. Prozone phenomenon Antigen and antibody reaction occurs optimally only when the proportion of the antigen and antibody in the reaction mixture is equivalent (zone of equivalence) (Fig. 14-1). On either side of the equivalence zone, precipitation is actually prevented because of an excess of either antigen or anti-body. The zone of antibody excess is known as the prozone phenomenon and the zone of antigen excess is known as postzone phenomenon. Marrack in 1934 proposed the lattice hypothesis to explain the prozone phenomenon. Marrack's hypothesis is based on the assumptions that each antibody molecule must have at least two binding sites, and antigen must be multivalent. In the zone of equivalence where optimum precipitation occurs, the number of multivalent sites of antigen and antibody are approximately equal. In this zone, precipitation occurs as a result of random, reversible reactions whereby each anti-body binds to more than one antigen and vice versa, form-ing a stable network or lattice. As they combine, it results in a multimolecular lattice that increases in size until it precipi-tates out of solution. Key Points In the prozone phenomenon, there is too much antibody for ef cient lattice formation. This is because antigen combines with only few antibodies and no cross-linkage is formed. In postzone phenomenon, small aggregates are surrounded by excess antigen and again no lattice network is formed. Thus, for precipitation reactions to be detectable, they must be run in the zone of equivalence (Fig. 14-2). The prozone and postzone phenomena are taken into con- sideration in the interpretation of serological tests, because false negative reactions can occur in either of these conditions. A false negative reaction suspected to be due to prozone phe-nomenon can be rectified by diluting out the antibody and performing the test. In the postzone phenomenon, excess anti-gen may obscure the presence of small amount of antibodies. Typically, such a test is repeated with an additional patient specimen taken about a week later. This would give time for the further production of antibodies. If the test is negative on this occasion, it is unlikely that the patient has that particular antibody. Types of precipitation reactions Precipitation reactions can be broadly of three types: 1. Precipitation in solution 2. Precipitation in agar 3. Precipitation in agar with an electric field Precipitation in solution Ring test and flocculation test are examples of precipitation in solution.Antigen Antibody Precipitate formed (optimal antigen and antibody concentration) Zone of antibody excessZone of antigen excessZone of equivalence FIG. 14-1. proper Chap-14.indd 103 5/14/2012 11:56:53 AM104 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 14 Ring test: In this test, antigen solution is layered over antiserum in a test tube. Precipitation between antigen and antibodies in antiserum solution is marked by the appear-ance of a ring of precipitation at the junction of two liquid layers. C-reactive protein (CRP) and streptococcal grouping by the Lancefield methods are the examples of the ring test. Flocculation test: Flocculation test may be performed in a slide or tube. VDRL test for detection of reaginic antibodies in syphilis is an example of a slide flocculation test . In this test, a drop of VDRL antigen suspension is added to a drop of patients' serum on a cavity slide, and the result is recorded after shaking the slide on a VDRL shaker. In a positive test, the floccules appear, which can be demonstrated well under a microscope. Kahn test for syphilis is an example of tube flocculation test. The tube flocculation test for standardiza-tion of toxins and toxoids is another example. Precipitation in agar The precipitation test in agar gel is termed as immunodiffusion test. In this test, reactants are added to the gel and antigen-antibody combination occurs by means of diffusion. The rate of diffusion is affected by the size of the particles, temperature, gel viscosity, amount of hydration, and interactions between the matrix and reactants. An agar concentration of 0.3-1.5% allows for diffusion of most reactants. Agarose is often preferred to agar because agar has a strong negative charge, while agarose has almost none, so that interactions between the gel and reactants are minimized. Key Points Immunodiffusion reactions have the following advantages: In this test, the line of precipitation is visible as a band, which can also be stained for preservation. The test can be used to detect identity, cross-reaction, and nonidentity between different antigens in a reacting mixture. Types of immunodiffusion reactions: Immunodiffusion reactions are classified based on the (a ) number of reactants diffusing and (b) direction of diffusion, as follows: Single diffusion in one dimension: Single diffusion in one dimension, as the name suggests, is the single diffusion of antigen in agar in one dimension. It is otherwise called Oudin procedure because this technique was pioneered by Oudin who for the first time used gels for precipitation reactions. In this method, antibody is incorporated into agar gel in a test tube and the antigen solution is poured over it. During the course of time, the antigen diffuses downward toward the antibody in agar gel and a line of precipitation is formed. The number of precipitate bands shows the number of dif-ferent antigens present in the antigen solution. Single diffusion in two dimensions: Single diffusion in two dimensions is also called radial immunodiffusion. In this method, antiserum solution containing antibody is incorpo-rated in agar gel on a slide or Petri dish. The wells are cut on the surface of gel. The antigen is then applied to a well cut into the gel. When antibody already present in the gel reacts with the antigen, which diffuses out of the well, a ring of pre-cipitation is formed around the wells. The diameter of the ring is directly proportional to th=e concentration of antigen. The greater the amount of antigen in the well, the farther the ring will be from the well (Fig. 14-3, Color Photo 6). Key Points Radial immunodiffusion has been used for the quantitative estimation of antibodies and antigens in the serum. It is used to measure: IgG, IgM, IgA, and complement components in the serum, antibodies to influenza virus in sera, and serum transferrin and /H9251-fetoprotein. However, the test has recently been replaced by more sen-sitive and automated methods, such as nephelometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Double diffusion in one dimension: This method is also called Oakley-Fulthrope procedure. In this method, the antibody is incorporated in agar gel in a test tube, above which a layer of plain agar is placed. The antigen is then layered on top of this plain agar. During the course of time, the antigen and antibody move toward each other through the intervening layer of plain agar. In this zone of plain agar, both antigen and antibody react with each other to form a band of pre-cipitation at their optimum concentration. Double diffusion in two dimensions: This method is also called the Ouchterlony procedure. In this method, both the antigen and antibody diffuse independently through agar gel in two dimensions, horizontally and vertically. The test is performed by cutting wells in the agar gel poured on a glass slide or in a Petri dish. The antiserum consisting of anti-bodies is placed in the central well, and different antigens are added to the wells surrounding the center well. After an incubation period of 12-48 hours in a moist chamber, the lines of preci pitins are formed at the sites of combination of antigens and antibodies (Color Photo 7). Three types of reactions can be demonstrated as follows (Fig. 14.4): FIG. 14-3. Radial immunodiffusion. Chap-14.indd 104 5/14/2012 11:56:53 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 105 1. Line of precipitation at their junction forming an arc represents serologic identity or the presence of a common epitope in antigens. 2. A pattern of crossed lines demonstrates tw o separate reactions and indicates that the com pared antigens are unrelated and share no common epitopes. 3. Fusion of two lines with a spur indicates cross-reaction or partial identity . In this last case, the two antigens share a common epitope, but some antibody molecules are not captured by the antigen and traverse through the initial precipitin line to combine with additional epitopes found in the more complex antigen. Key Points Double diffusion in two dimension has been used for: demonstration of antibodies in serodiagnosis of small pox, identification of fungal antigens, and detection of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens. Elek's precipitation test in gel is a special test used for demon-stration of toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Precipitation in agar with an electric field Immunoelectrophoresis: Immunoelectrophoresis is a process of combination of immunodiffusion and electrophoresis. It is a method in which different antigens in serum are separated according to their charge under an electric field. In this method, a drop of antigen is placed into a well in agar on a glass slide. An electric current is then passed through the agar. During electrophoresis, antigens move in the electric field according to their charge and size. Following electrophoresis, a trough is cut into the agar and is filled with the antibody and diffusion is allowed to occur. As the antigen and antibody diffuse toward each other, they form a series of lines of precipitation (Fig. 14-5). The main advantage of immunoelectrophoresis is that a number of antigens can be identified in serum. The method is used to detect normal as well as abnormal proteins, such as myeloma proteins in human serum.Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis: Counter-current immu-noelectrophoresis depends on movement of antigen towards the anode and of antibody towards the cathode through the agar under electric field. The test is performed on a glass slide with agarose in which a pair of wells is punched out. One well is filled with antigen and the other with antibody. Electric current is then passed through the gel. The migration of antigen and antibody is greatly facilitated under electric field, and the line of precipitation is made visible in 30-60 minutes (Fig. 14-6). Key Points The counter-current immunoelectrophoresis has many uses: It is a rapid and a highly specific method for detection of both antigen and antibodies in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids in diagnosis of many infectious diseases including bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic. It is commonly used for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), /H9251-fetoprotein, hydatid and amoebic antigens in the serum, and cryptococcal antigen in the CSF. Rocket electrophoresis: This technique is an adaptation of radial immunodiffusion developed by Laurell. It is called so due to the appearance of the precipitin bands in the shape of cone-like structures (rocket appearance) at the end of the reaction (Fig. 14-7, Color Photo 8). In this method, antibody is incorporated in the gel and antigen is placed in Ag Ab+ve veElectrophoretic current FIG. 14-6. b Chap-14.indd 105 5/14/2012 11:56:53 AM106 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 14 wells cut in the gel. Electric current is then passed through the gel, which facilitates the migration of antigen into the agar. This results in formation of a precipitin line that is conical in shape, resembling a rocket. The height of the rocket, measured from the well to the apex, is directly in proportion to the amount of antigen in the sample (Fig. 14-8). Rocket electrophoresis is used mainly for quantitative estimation of antigen in the serum.Two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis: Two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis is a variant of rocket electrophoresis. It is a double diffusion technique used for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of sera for a wide range of antigens. This test is a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, antigens in solution are separated by electrophoresis. In the second stage, electrophoresis is carried out again, but perpendicular to that of first stage to obtain rocket-like precipitation. In this test, first, a small trough is cut in agar gel on a glass plate and is filled with the antigen solution. Electric current is then passed through the gel, and the antigens migrate into the gel at a rate proportional to their net electric charge. In the sec-ond stage, after electrophoresis, the gel piece containing the separated antigens is placed on a second glass plate and the agar containing antibody is poured around the gel piece. A second electric potential is applied at right angles to the first direction of migration. The preseparated antigens then migrate into the gel containing antibodies at a rate proportional to their net charge and precipitate with antibodies in the gel, forming precipitates. This method is both qualitative, in that it identifies different antigens that are present in the serum solution, and quantita-tive, in that it detects the amount of different antigens present in the solution.Turbidimetry and nephelometry: Turbidimetry and nephelo-metry are the two methods used to detect and quantitate precipitation reactions in serum and are based on the phenomenon of light scattering by precipitates in a solution. Turbidimetry is a measurement of turbidity or cloudiness of precipitate in a solution. In this method, a detection device is placed in direct line with the incident light that collects the light after it has passed through the solution. It thus measures the reduction in the intensity of light due to reflection, absorption, or scatter. Scattering of light occurs in proportion to the size, shape, and concentration of precipitates present in solution. Nephelometry is an improvement on this technique in that it measures the light that is scattered at a particular angle from the incident beam as it passes through a suspension containing the antigen-antibody precipitate. The amount of light scattered is an index of the concentration of the solution. Beginning with a constant amount of antibody, an increasing amount of anti-gen would result in an increase in antigen-antibody complexes. Thus the relationship between antigen concentrations, as indi-cated by the antigen-antibody complex formation, and light scattering approaches linearity. By using a computer, the exact values of the antigen or antibody in the serum can be estimated through this system. To improve the sensitivity of this system, laser beams have been used as the source of incident light. Key Points Nephelometry is now becoming the method of choice for use in various laboratories for the measurement of plasma proteins including IgG, IgM, and IgA, complement components, RA (rheumatoid arthritis) factor, ASLO (anti-streptolysin O), etc. Agglutination Agglutination is an antigen-antibody reaction in which a par-ticulate antigen combines with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a specified temperature and pH resulting in for-mation of visible clumping of particles. Agglutination occurs optimally when antigens and antibodies react in equivalent proportions. Agglutination reactions are mostly similar to precipitation reactions in their fundamentals and share similar features. This reaction is analogous to the precipitation reaction in that antibodies act as a bridge to form a lattice network of antibodies and the cells that carry the antigen on their sur-face. Because cells are so much larger than a soluble anti-gen, the result is more visible when the cells aggregate into clumps. Agglutination differs from precipitation reaction in that since the former reaction takes place at the surface of the particle involved, the antigen must be exposed and be able to bind with the antibody to produce visible clumps. In agglutination reactions, serial dilutions of the antibody solution are made and a constant amount of particulate antigen is added to serially diluted antibody solutions. After several hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C, clumping is recorded by visual inspection. The titer of the antiserum is recorded FIG. 14-8. Photograph of rocket electrophoresis. Chap-14.indd 106 5/14/2012 11:56:54 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 107 as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that causes clump-ing. Since the cells have many antigenic determinants on their surface, the phenomenon of antibody excess is rarely encountered. Occasionally, antibodies are formed that react with the antigenic determinants of a cell but does not cause any agglu-tination. They inhibit the agglutination by the complete anti-bodies added subsequently. Such antibodies are called blocking antibodies. Anti-Rh antibodies and anti-brucella antibodies are few examples of such blocking antibodies. Agglutination reactions have a wide variety of applications in the detection of both antigens and antibodies in serum and other body fluids. They are very sensitive and the result of the test can be read visually with ease. Types of agglutination reactions Agglutination reactions where the antigens are found naturally on a particle are known as direct agglutination. This is different from passive agglutination, which employs particles that are coated with antigens not normally found on their surfaces. Direct agglutination Direct agglutination reactions can broadly be of the following types: (a ) slide agglutination, (b is a basic type of agglutination reaction that is performed on a slide. Identification of bacterial types represents a classic example of a direct slide agglutination that is still used today. In this test, a suspension of bacteria is prepared and is added to a drop of standardized antiserum. A positive reaction is indicated by clumping of bacteria and clearing of the background solution. Clumping occurs instantly or within seconds in a positive test. A control consisting of antigen suspension in saline without adding antiserum is included on the same slide. It is used to validate the results and also to detect possible false positives due to autoagglutination of the antigen. Key Points Slide agglutination is used: As a routine procedure to identify bacterial strains, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, etc., isolated from clinical specimens. For blood grouping and cross-matching. Tube agglutination test: Tube agglutination test, as the name suggests, is performed in glass tubes. Typically, in these tests, patient's serum is diluted in a series of tubes and bacterial antigens specific for the suspected disease are added to it. Antigen and antibody reactions are demonstrated by demonstration of visible clumps of agglutination. It is a standard method used for quantitative estimation of antibodies in the serum. Tube agglutination tests are routinely used for demonstration of antibodies in the serum for serodiagnosis of enteric fever and brucellosis, as follows:Key Points Widal test is used to diagnose enteric fever and uses differ-ent Salmonella antigens (T O, TH, AH, and BH) to detect the presence of antibodies to Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, and S. paratyphi B in patient's serum. The standard agglutination test is a commonly used test for serodiagnosis of brucellosis. The tube agglutination test for brucellosis, however, is complicated by the prozone phenomenon. This is due to high concentration of bru-cella antibodies in patient's serum, resulting in false nega-tive reactions. This problem is obviated by use of several dilutions of serum to prevent false positive reactions. The presence of blocking or incomplete antibodies in the serum is another problem. This is avoided by using antiglobulin (Coombs' test) to detect these antibodies. Heterophile agglutination test: This test depends on demons-tration of heterophilic antibodies in serum present in certain bacterial infections: Key Points Weil-Felix test is an example of heterophile agglutina-tion reaction for serodiagnosis of rickettsial infections. In this test, the cross-reacting antibodies produced against rickettsial pathogen are detected by using related antigens (e.g., Proteus strains OXK, OX19, and OX2). Although the antibodies are produced against rickettsial organisms, they cross-react with antigens of Proteus test is another heterophile agglutination test, which is used to detect antibodies in infectious mono-nucleosis by using sheep erythrocytes as antigens. Streptococcus MG agglutination test is a similar test used for detection of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae causing primary atypical pneumonia. Antiglobulin was devised originally by Coombs', Mourant, and Race for detection of incomplete anti-Rh antibodies that do not agglutinate Rh/H11001 erythrocytes in saline. When serum containing mixed with Rh/H11001 erythrocytes in saline, incomplete antibody antiglobulin coats the surface of erythrocytes but does not cause any agglutination. When such erythrocytes are treated with antiglobulin or 5/14/2012 AM108 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 14(rabbit antiserum human /H9253 globulin), then the cells are agglutinated. Coombs' test is of two types: (a) direct Coombs' test and (b) indirect Coombs' test. Direct Coombs' test : In this test, the sensitization of red blood cells (RBCs) with incomplete antibodies takes place in vivo. The cell-bound antibodies can be detected by this test in which antiserum against human immunoglobulin is used to agglutinate patient's red cells (Fig. 14-9). Indirect Coombs' test : In this test, the sensitization of RBCs with incomplete antibodies takes place in vitro. In this test, the patient's serum is mixed with normal red cells and antiserum to human immunoglobulin is added. Agglutina-tion occurs if antibodies are present in the patient's serum (Fig. 14-10).Coombs' tests are used for detection of (a ) anti-Rh antibodies and (b ) incomplete antibodies in brucellosis and other diseases. Passive agglutination Passive agglutination employs carrier particles that are coated with soluble antigens. This is usually done to convert precipitation reactions into agglutination reactions, since the latter are easier to perform and interpret and are more sensitive than precipitation reactions for detection of anti-bodies. When the antibody instead of antigens is adsorbed on the carrier particle for detection of antigens, it is called reverse passive agglutination. Until the 1970s, erythrocytes were the major carrier particles used for coating of antigens. Recently, however, a variety of other particles including polystyrene latex, bentonite, and charcoal are used for this purpose. Particle size vary from 7 /H9262 for RBCs to 0.05 /H9262 for very fine latex particles. The use of synthetic beads or particles provides the advantage of consistency, uniformity, and stability. Reactions are also easy to read visually. Passive agglutination reac-tion, depending on the carrier particles used, can be of the follow-ing types: ( i) latex agglutination (iii) coagglutination test.Latex agglutination test: It is a test that employs latex particles as carrier of antigen or antibodies. In 1955, Singer and Plotz accidentally found that IgG was naturally adsorbed to the surface of polystyrene latex particles. Latex particles are inexpensive, relatively stable and are not subject to cross-reactivity with other antibodies. These particles can be coated with antibodies to detect antigen in the serum and other body fluids. Use of monoclonal antibodies has reduced the cross-reactions resulting in reduction of false positive reactions. Additionally, the large particle size of the latex facilitates better visualization of antigen-antibody reactions by the naked eye observation. The tests are usually performed on cardboard cards or glass slides and positive reactions are graded on a scale of 1/H11001 to 4/H11001 . Key Points The latex agglutination tests have following uses: The tests are used for rapid identification of antigens of group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria menin- gitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans , etc. The tests have also been found to be useful for detection of soluble microbial antigens in urine, spinal fluid, and serum for diagnosis of a variety of infectious diseases. These tests are being used to detect RA factor, ASLO, CRP, etc., in serum specimens. Hemagglutination test: RBCs are used as carrier particles in hemagglutination tests. RBCs of sheep, human, chick, etc. are commonly used in the test. When RBCs are coated with antigen to detect antibodies in the serum, the test is called indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test . The IHA is a most commonly used test for serodiagnosis of many parasitic diseases including amoebiasis, hydatid disease, and toxoplasmosis. When antibodies are attached to the RBCs to detect micro- bial antigen, it is known as reverse passive hemagglutination (RPHA). The RPHA has been used extensively in the past to detect viral antigens, such as in HBsAg in the serum for diagnosis of hepatitis B infection. The test has also been used for detection of antigens in many other viral and parasitic infections. Viral hemagglutination: Many viruses including influenza, mumps, and measles have the ability to agglutinate RBCs with-out antigen-antibody reactions. This process is called viral hemagglutination. This hemagglutination can be inhibited by antibody specifically directed against the virus, and this phenomenon is called hemagglutination inhibition. This forms the basis of the viral hemagglutination inhibition test, which is used to detect antibodies in patient's sera that neutralize the agglutinating viruses. To perform this test, patient's serum is first incubated with a viral preparation. Then RBCs that the virus is known to agglutinate are added to the mixture. If anti-body is present, this will combine with viral particles and prev ent + Antibodies in patient's 5/14/2012 11:56:54 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 109 agglutination, and a lack of or reduction in agglutination indi-cates presence of antibody in patient's serum.Coagglutination test: Coagglutination is a type of agglutination reaction in which Cowan I strain of S. aureus is used as carrier particle to coat antibodies. Cowan I strain of S. aureus contains protein A, an anti-antibody, that combines with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin, IgG, leaving the Fab region free to react with the antigen present in the specimens (Fig. 14-11). In a positive test, protein A bearing S. aureus coated with antibodies will be agglutinated if mixed with specific antigen. The advantage of the test is that these particles show greater stability than latex particles and are more refractory to changes in ionic strength. Key Points Coagglutination test has been used for: Detection of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis; Detection of amoebic and hydatid antigens diagnosis echinococcosis, respectively; and Grouping of typing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Complement-Dependent Serological Tests The complement system is a group of serum proteins that is present in normal serum. The system consists of 20 or more serum proteins that interact with one another and with cell membrane. It is a biochemical cascade that helps to clear patho-gens from the body. It aids the antibodies in lysing bacteria, promoting phagocytosis, and in immune adherence. The com-plement-dependent serological tests may be of the following types: 1. Complement fixation test 2. Immune adherence test 3. Immobilization test 4. Cytolytic or cytocidal reactions Complement fixation test The principle of the complement fixation test is that when anti-gen and antibodies of the IgM or the IgG classes are mixed, com-plement is \"fixed\" to the antigen-antibody complex. If this occurs on the surface of RBCs, the complement cascade will be activated and hemolysis will occur. The complement fixation test consists of two antigen-antibody complement systems: (a ) an indicator system and (b ) a test system. Indicator system: It consists of RBCs that have been preincu-bated with a specific anti-RBC antibody, in concentrations that do not cause agglutination, and no hemolysis of RBCs occurs in the absence of complement. Such RBCs are designated as \"sensitized\" red cells.Test system: In the test system, patient's serum is first heated to 56\u00b0C to inactivate the native complement. Then the inac-tivated serum is adsorbed with washed sheep RBC to elimi-nate broadly cross-reactive anti-RBC antibodies (also known as Forssman-type antibodies), which could interfere with the assay. The serum is then mixed with purified antigen and with a dilution of fresh guinea pig serum, used as source of +Antibody-coatedparticles (S. aureus) Antigen Precipitatevisible FIG. 14-11.

The mixture is incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow antibody in the patient's serum to form complexes with the antigen and to fix complement (Fig. 14-12). In complement fixation test, \"sensitized\" red cells are then added to the mixture. If the red cells are lysed, it indicates that there were no antibodies specific to the antigen in the serum of the patient. The complement therefore was not consumed in the test system and was available to be used by the anti-RBC antibodies, resulting in hemolysis. This reaction is considered negative. The test is considered positive if the red cells are not lysed. Nonlysis of the cells indicates that patient's serum had antibodies specific to the antigen, which have \"fixed\" comple-ment. Hence, no complement was available to be activated by the indicator system. Key Points The complement xation reactions were used earlier for diagnosis of many infections, such as: Wassermann test for syphilis and Tests for demonstration of antibodies to M. pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis , many different viruses, and to fungi (such as Cryptococcus spp., Histoplasma, and Coccidioides immitis). Since this test is technically very cumbersome, and often dif cult, it is no longer used now-a-days. Indirect complement fixation test: Indirect complement fixation test is carried out to test the sera that cannot fix guinea pig complement. These include avian sera (e.g., parrot, duck) and mammalian sera (e.g., cat, horse). The test is carried out in duplicate and after the first test, the standard antiserum known to fix the complement is added to one set. Hemolysis indicates a positive test. In a positive test, if the serum contains antibody, the antigen would have been used up in the first test, standard antiserum added subsequently would fail to fix the complement, therefore causing hemolysis.Conglutinating complement adsorption test: It is an alter- native method for systems that do not fix guinea pig com-plement. Sheep erythrocytes sensitized with bovine serum are used as the indicator system. The bovine serum con-tains conglutinin, a /H9252 globulin that acts as antibody to the complement. Therefore, conglutinin causes agglutination of sensitized sheep erythrocytes if these are combined with complement, which is known as conglutination. If the horse complement had been used up by the antigen-antibody reac-tion in the first step, the agglutination of the sensitized cells does not occur. Immune adherence test Immune adherence test is a test in which certain pathogens (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Treponema pallidum, etc.) react with specific antibodies in the presence of complement and adhere to eryth-rocytes or platelets. The adherence of cells to bacteria is known as immune adherence, which facilitates phagocytosis of the bacteria. Immobilization test Immobilization test is a complement-dependent test in which certain live bacteria, such as T. pallidum, are immobilized when mixed with patient's serum in the presence of complement. This forms the basis of T. pallidum immobilization test. A posi-tive test shows serum to contain treponemal antibodies. Cytolytic or cytocidal reactions When a live bacterium, such as V. cholerae, is mixed with its specific antibody in the presence of complement, the bacterium is killed and lysed. This forms the basis of test used to measure anti-cholera antibodies in the serum. Neutralization Tests Neutralization is an antigen-antibody reaction in which the biological effects of viruses and toxins are neutralized by homologous antibodies known as neutralizing antibodies. These tests are broadly of two types: (a) virus neutralization tests and (b) toxin neutralization tests. Virus neutralization tests Neutralization of viruses by their specific antibodies are called virus neutralization tests. Inoculation of viruses in cell cul-tures, eggs, and animals results in the replication and growth of viruses. When virus-specific neutralizing antibodies are injected into these systems, replication and growth of viruses is inhibited. This forms the basis of virus neutralization test. Viral hemagglutination inhibition test is an example of virus neutralization test frequently used in the diagnosis of viral infections, such as influenza, mumps, and measles. If patient's serum contains antibodies against certain viruses that have the property of agglutinating the red blood cells, these antibodies react with the viruses and inhibit the agglutination of the red blood cells. Toxin neutralization tests Toxin neutralization tests are based on the principle that bio-logical action of toxin is neutralized on reacting with specific neutralizing antibodies called antitoxins. Examples of neutral-ization tests include: In vivo\u2014(a) Schick test to demonstrate immunity against diphtheria and (b) Clostridium welchii toxin neutralization test in guinea pig or mice. In vitro\u2014(a) antistreptolysin O test and (b) Nagler reaction used for rapid detection of C. welchii. Opsonization Opsonization is a process by which a particulate antigen becomes more susceptible to phagocytosis when it combines with opsonin. The opsonin is a heat-labile substance present in fresh normal sera. Unlike opsonin, bacteriotropin is heat-stable substance present in the but with similar activities. Chap-14.indd 110 5/14/2012 11:56:55 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 111 microscope (Fig. 14-13). Direct immunofluorescence test is widely used for detection of bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi, or other antigens in CSF, blood, stool, urine, tissues, and other specimens. Few examples include: Key Points Direct immunofluorescence test for antemortem diagnosis of rabies: The test is used for detection of rabies virus anti-gen in the skin smear collected from the nape of the neck in humans and in the saliva of dogs. Also used for detection of N. gonorrhoeae, C. diphtheriae, T. pallidum, etc. directly in appropriate clinical specimens. The need for preparation of separate labeled antibody for each pathogen is the major disadvantage of the direct immunofluo-rescence test. Indirect immunofluorescence test The indirect immunofluorescence test is used for detection of specific antibodies in the serum and other body fluids for sero-diagnosis of many infectious diseases. Indirect immunofluorescence is a two-stage process. In the first stage, a known antigen is fixed on a slide. Then the patient's serum to be tested is applied to the slide, followed by careful washing. If the patient's serum contains antibody against the antigen, it will combine with antigen on the slide. In the second stage, the combination of antibody with anti-gen can be detected by addition of a fluorescent dye-labeled antibody to human IgG, which is examined by a fluorescence microscope. The first step in the indirect immunofluorescence test is the incubation of a fixed antigen (e.g., in a cell or tissue) with unlabeled antibody, which becomes associated with the antigen. Next, after careful washing, a fluorescent antibody (e.g., fluores-cent labeled anti-IgG) is added to the smear. This second antibody will become associated to the first, and the antigen-antibody complex can be visualized on the fluorescence microscope. The indirect method has the advantage of using a single labeled antiglobulin (antibody to IgG) as a \"universal reagent\" to detect many different specific antigen-antibody reactions. The test is often more sensitive than the direct immunofluorescence test. Key Points Indirect immunofl uorescence test is used widely to: Detect specific antibodies for serodiagnosis of syphilis, leptospirosis, amoebiasis, toxoplasmosis, and many other infectious diseases; Identify the class of a given antibody by using fluorescent antibodies specific for different immunoglobulin isotypes; Identify and enumerate lymphocyte subpopulations by employing monoclonal antibodies and cytofluorographs; and Detect autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies in autoimmune diseases.The term \"opsonic index\" is defined as the ratio of the phagocytic activity of patient's blood for a particular bacterium to the phagocytic activity of blood from a normal individual. It is used to study the progress of resistance during the course of disease. It is measured by incubating fresh citrated blood with the suspension of bacteria at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes and estimat-ing the average number of phagocytic bacteria from the stained blood films. Immunofluorescence The property of certain dyes absorbing light rays at one parti-cular wavelength (ultraviolet light) and emitting them at a different wavelength (visible light) is known as fluorescence. Fluorescent dyes, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate and lissa-mine with antibody molecules. They emit blue-green and orange-red fluorescence, respectively under ultraviolet (UV) rays in the fluorescence microscope. This forms the basis of the immunological test. Immunofluorescence tests have wide applications in research and diagnostics. These tests are broadly of two types: 1. Direct immunofluorescence test 2. Indirect immunofluorescence test Direct immunofluorescence test Direct immunofluorescence test is used to detect unknown antigen in a cell or tissue by employing a known labeled anti-body that interacts directly with unknown antigen. If antigen is present, it reacts with labeled antibody and the antibody-coated antigen is observed under UV light of the fluorescence FIG. 14-13. Direct fluorescent antibody test.Antibodies Fluorochrome Antigen oncell surfaceBacterial cell Bacterial cell with bound antibodies combined with combined with fluorochrome Chap-14.indd 111 5/14/2012 11:56:56 AM112 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 14been formed and will not get washed away. On the other hand, if the specific antibody was not present in the specimen, there would not be any complex formation. Next, an anti-isotype antibody conjugated with an enzyme is added and incubated. After another washing step, a substrate for the enzyme is added. If there was complex formation in the initial step, the second-ary anti-isotype antibody would have bound to the primary antibody, and there would be a chromogenic reaction between the enzyme and substrate. By measuring the optical density val-ues of the wells, after a stop solution has been added to arrest the chromogenic reaction, one can determine the amount of antigen-antibody complex formed in the first step (Fig. 14-14). Key Points The test is extensively used for determination of serum anti-bodies for diagnosis of human immunode ciency virus (HIV) infection, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and many other viral infections. Sandwich ELISA The sandwich ELISA is used for the detection of antigen. In this test, the known antibody is coated and immobilized onto the wells of microtiter plates. The test sample containing the suspected antigen is added to the wells and is allowed to react with the antibodies in the wells. After the step of washing the well, a second enzyme-conjugated antibody specific for a dif-ferent epitope of the antigen is added and allowed to incubate. After removing any free secondary antibody by rewashing, the specific substrate is added, and the ensuing chromogenic reac-tion is measured. The chromogenic reaction is then compared with a standard curve to determine the exact amount of the antigen present in the test sample. In a positive test, an enzyme acts on the substrate to produce a color, and its intensity can be measured by spectrophotometer or ELISA reader. The change of color can also be observed by the naked eye (Fig. 14-15). The major limitation of immunofluorescence is that the tech-nique requires (a) expensive fluorescence microscope and reagents, (b) trained personnel, and (c) have a factor of subjec-tivity that may result in erroneous results. Enzyme Immunoassays Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can be used for detection of either antigens or antibodies in serum and other body fluids of the patient. In EIA techniques, antigen or antibody labeled with enzymes are used. Alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxi-dase, and galactosidase are the enzymes used in the EIA tests. The commonly used EIAs are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The ELISA technique was first conceptualized and developed by Peter Perlmann and Eva Engvall at Stockholm University, Sweden. These assays involve the use of an immunosorbent specific to either the antigen or antibody. Following the antigen- antibody reaction, chromogenic substrate specific to the enzyme dihydrochloride for peroxidase, p-nitrophenyl phosphate for alkaline phosphatase, etc.) is added. The reaction is detected by reading the optical density. Usually, a standard curve based on known concentrations of antigen or antibody is prepared from which the unknown quantities are calculated. There are different types of ELISAs available for the detection and quantitation of either the antigen or antibodies in serum and other body fluids. These include: (a ) indirect ELISA, (b ) sandwich ELISA, competi- tive ELISA, and (d ) ELISPOT assay. Indirect ELISA The indirect ELISA is used for the quantitative estimation of antibodies in the serum and other body fluids. In this method, specimens are added to microtiter plate wells coated with antigen to which specific antibodies are to be detected. After a period of incubation, the wells are washed. If antibody was present in the sample, antigen-antibody complex would have Antigen is adsorbed to well surfaceClinical specimen is added: antibody binds to antigenExcess unbound antibody is washed off during washingExcess unbound enzyme antibody is washed off during anti-immunoglobulin antibody binds to antibodyEnzyme substrate ( ) is added and substrate is converted to product ( ) that causes a visible colorAntigenAntibodyEnzyme conjugated 11:56:56 AMSection II Chapter 14ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY REACTIONS 113 Key Points The sandwich ELISA is used to detect rotavirus and entero-toxin of Escherichia coli in feces. Competitive ELISA Competitive ELISA is another technique used for the esti-mation of antibodies present in a specimen, such as serum. Principle of the test is that two specific antibodies, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in test serum (if serum is positive for antibodies), are used. Competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen. Appearance of color indicates a negative test (absence of anti-bodies), while the absence of color indicates a positive test (presence of antibodies). In this test, the microtiter wells are coated with HIV anti- gen. The sera to be tested are added to these wells and incu-bated at 37\u00b0C and then washed. If antibodies are present in the test serum, antigen-antibody reaction occurs. The antigen- antibody reaction is detected by adding enzyme-labeled-specific HIV antibodies. In a positive test, no antigen is left for these antibodies to act. Hence, the antibodies remain free and are washed away during the process of washing. When substrate is added, no enzyme is available to act on it. Therefore, positive result indicates no color reaction. In a negative test, in which no antibodies are present in the serum, antigen in the coated wells is available to combine with enzyme-conjugated antibodies and the enzyme acts on the substrate to produce color. Key Points Competitive ELISA is the most commonly used test for detec-tion of HIV antibodies in serum in patients with HIV. ELISPOT Assay ELISPOT assay is a modification of ELISA. It allows the quanti-tative determination of number of cells in a population that are producing antibodies specific for a given antigen or an antigen for which one has a specific antibody. These tests have found application widely in the measurement of cytokines. Radioimmunoassay When radioisotopes instead of enzymes are used as labels to be conjugated with antigens or antibodies, the technique of detection of the antigen-antibody complex is called as radio-immunoassay (RIA). RIA was first described in 1960 for mea-surement of endogenous plasma insulin by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow of the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York. Yalow was awarded the 1977 Nobel Prize for Medicine for the development of the RIA for peptide hor-mones, but because of his untimely death in 1972, Berson could not share the award. The classical RIA methods are based on the principle of competitive binding. In this method, unlabeled antigen competes with radiolabeled antigen for binding to antibody with the appropriate specificity. Thus, when mixtures of radiolabeled and unlabeled antigen are incubated with the corresponding antibody, the amount of free (not bound to antibody) radiolabeled antigen is directly proportional to the quantity of unlabeled antigen in the mixture. In the test, mixtures of known variable amounts of cold antigen and fixed amounts of labeled antigen and mixtures of samples with unknown concentrations of antigen with identi-cal amounts of labeled antigen are prepared in the first step. Identical amounts of antibody are added to the mixtures. Antigen-antibody complexes are precipitated either by cross-linking with a second antibody or by means of the addition of reagents that promote the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes. Counting radioactivity in the precipitates allows Antibody is adsorbed to well surfaceClinical specimen is added: antigen binds to antibodyExcess unbound antigen is washed off during washingExcess unbound enzyme conjugated antibody is washed off during washing Enzyme conjugated antibody specific for the test antigen binds to antigen forming sandwichEnzyme substrate ( ) is added and substrate is converted to product ( ) that causes a visible colorAntigenAntibodyEnzyme conjugated AM114 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 14the determination of the amount of radiolabeled antigen pre-cipitated with the antibody. A standard curve is constructed by plotting the percentage of antibody-bound radiolabeled anti-gen against known concentrations of a standardized unlabeled antigen, and the concentrations of antigen in patient samples are extrapolated from that curve. The extremely high sensitivity of RIA is its major advantage: Key Points Uses of RIA: The test can be used to determine very small quantities (e.g., nanogram) of antigens and antibodies in the serum. The test is used for quantitation of hormones, drugs, HBsAg, and other viral antigens. The main drawbacks of the RIA include: (a) the cost of equip-ment and reagents, (b) short shelf-life of radiolabeled com-pounds, and (c) the problems associated with the disposal of radioactive waste. Western Blotting Western blotting is called so because the procedure is similar to Southern blotting, which was developed by Edwin Southern for the detection of DNA. While Southern blotting is done to detect DNA, Western blotting is done for the detection of proteins.Western blotting is usually done on a tissue homogenate or extract. It uses SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), a type of gel electro-phoresis to first separate various proteins in a mixture on the basis of their shape and size. The protein bands thus obtained are transferred onto a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane where they are \"probed\" with antibodies specific to the protein to be detected. The antigen-antibody com-plexes that form on the band containing the protein recog-nized by the antibody can be visualized in a variety of ways. If the protein of interest was bound by a radioactive anti-body, its position on the blot can be determined by exposing the membrane to a sheet of X-ray film, a procedure called autoradiography . However, the most generally used detec- tion procedures employ enzyme-linked antibodies against the protein. After binding of the enzyme-antibody conju-gate, addition of a chromogenic substrate that produces a highly colored and insoluble product causes the appear-ance of a colored band at the site of the target antigen. The site of the protein of interest can be determined with much higher sensitivity if a chemiluminescent compound along with suitable enhancing agents is used to produce light at the antigen site (Fig. 14-16). Key Points Western blot technique has many uses as follows: It is used for identification of a specific protein in a com-plex mixture of proteins. In this method, known antigens of well-defined molecular weight are separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The separated bands of known antigens are then probed with the sample suspected of containing antibody specifi c for one or more of these antigens. Reaction of an antibody with a band is detected by using either radiolabeled or enzyme-linked secondary antibody that is specific for the species of the antibodies in the test sample. It is also used for estimation of the size of the protein as well as the amount of protein present in the mixture. The Western blot test is most widely used as a confirma-tory test for diagnosis of HIV, where this procedure is used to determine whether the patient has antibodies that react with one or more viral proteins or not. The Western blotting is also used for demonstration of spe-cific antibodies in the serum for diagnosis energy in the form of light during the anti-gen-antibody reactions. The emitted lights are measured and the concentration of the analyze is calculated. The assay is a fully automated method, which is used commonly for drug sensitiv-ity testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proteins are separated through SDS-PAGE Nitrocellulose paper Antibodies attach to specific antigen bands on nitrocellulose paper Bands can be visually interpretedEnzyme conversion of substrateidentifies the antigenIncubation with enzymeconjugated antihumanserum on gel wereblotted onto nitrocellulose paper 14-16.

These are of the following types: Immunoelectronmicroscopy This is a test used to detect rotavirus and hepatitis A virus directly in feces. In this test, viral particles are mixed with spe-cific antisera and are demonstrated as clumps of virion particles under the electron microscope. Immunoenzyme test This test is used to detect antigen directly in tissue specimens, in which tissue sections are treated with peroxidase-labeled antisera to detect corresponding antigen. The peroxidase bound to the antigen is visualized under the electron microscope. Immunoferritin test Electron-dense substances, such as ferritin are conjugated with antibody and such labeled antibodies reacting with antigen can be visualized under the electron microscope. Chap-14.indd 115 5/14/2012 11:56:57 AMMycobacterium Leprae43 Complement System15 Introduction The term complement refers to the ability of a system of some nonspecific proteins in normal human serum to complement, i.e., augment the effects of other components of immune system, such as antibody. The complement system, which is an important component of the human innate host defense system, consists of approximately 20 proteins that are present in normal human serum. The Complement System The complement system is an extremely powerful system comprising of rapidly acting glycoproteins, several proenzymes, and components, and it exists in an inactive state in the plasma. All normal individuals always have complement components in their blood. Properties of Complement Complement shows the following properties: 1. It is present in sera of all mammals including humans and in low er animals including birds, amphibians, and fishes. 2. These are heat-labile substances that are inactivated by heating serum at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. 3. These are gly coproteins and are synthesized primarily by liver cells and to a v ery less extent by macrophages and many other cell types. The rate of synthesis of the various complement glycoproteins increase when complement is activated and consumed. 4. The complement usually does not bind to the antigen or antibody but only to antigen-antibody complex. 5. The im portance of the complement lies in the fact that it contributes to both the acq uired and innate immunity of an individual. Nomenclature of Complement Complement components are designated by numerals, viz., C1-9. These components circulate in plasma in the form of pro-enzymes that are functionally inactive. Activation involves cleav-age by proteolysis into peptide fragments. The fragments are designated with lowercase suffixes\u2014for example, C3 is cleaved into two fragments, C3a and C3b. Normally, the large fragment is designated \"b\", and the small fragment \"a\". But for historical reasons, with respect to the fragments of C2, the large fragment is designated C2a and the small one is designated C2b. Key Points Effects of complement There are four main effects of complement: It causes lysis of cells (such as bacteria, viruses, allografts, and tumor cells). It generates mediators that participate in triggering specific cell functions, inflammation, and secretion of immunoregu-latory molecules. It facilitates opsonization, the process by which bacteria are more readily and more efficiently engulfed by phagocytes. It causes immune clearance, in which immune complexes from the circulation are removed and are transported to spleen and liver. Activation of Complement Complement activation takes place through any of the follow-ing three pathways: 1. The classical pathway 2. The alternative pathway 3. The lectin pathway Of these, alternative and lectin pathwa ys are important in the innate immunity of the host. These two are also more impor-tant when the human host is infected by a microorganism for the rst time, because the antibody required to trigger the clas-sical pathway is not present. All the three activation pathways lead to activation of C3, resulting in the production of C3b. Hence, C3b is consi-dered as the central molecule in the activation of the comple- ment cascade. Key Points The C3b has two important functions to perform: First, it combines with other components of the comple-ment to produce C5 convertase, the enzyme that leads to the production of membrane attack complex; and Second, it opsonizes bacteria due to the presence of receptors for C3b on the surface of the phagocytes. Chap-15.indd 116 5/14/2012 11:56:25 AMSection II Chapter 15COMPLEMENT SYSTEM 117 The nal steps that lead to the formation of a membrane attack complex are same in all the pathways. When these complement components are activated, a sequential, rapid cascading pattern ensues. This is because once a complement component is activated, it is either cleaved or becomes bound to a previously activated component or com plex of complement components. Also, each component or com plex of components, once activated, generally ampli es the cascading process by acti- vating many molecules of the next component in the series. Classical Pathway of Complement Activation The classical pathway is a chain of events in which complement components react in specific sequences as a cascade resulting in cell lysis. It is activated by antibody bound to antigen but never by native or free antibody. Key Points Activators of the classical pathway: Activators of classical pathways include the following: Immunoglobulins IgM and IgG. The IgG subclasses vary with regard to their efficiency in activating the comple-ment; IgG3 immunoglobulins are the most efficient, fol-lowed by IgG1 and IgG2. IgG4 immunoglobulins do not activate the classical pathway. Native, free IgG or IgM do not activate the complement system. A single, native IgG molecule will not bind and activate the complement pathway. However, if antibod-ies of the IgG class are aggregated by antigen binding, this will result in complement fixation and activation. The formation of an antigen-antibody complex induces conformational changes in the Fc portion of the IgM molecule that expose a binding site for the C1 compo-nent of the complement system Staphylococcal protein A, C-reactive protein, and DNA Steps of activation of classical pathway: The classical pathway of complement activation usually begins with the formation of soluble antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes) or with the binding of antibody to antigen on a suitable target, such as a bacterial cell (Fig. 15-1). Following are the sequential steps in the activation of classical pathway: 1. Activation of C1 is the first step in the cascade of classical pathway activation. The C1 actually is a com plex of three different types of molecules: C1q, C1r, and C1s. C1q first combines with the Fc portion of the bound antibody, IgM or IgG. This results in the sequential activation of C4, C2, and C3. For C1 to be activated, it must bind to at least two adjacent Fc regions. This means that the concentration of antibody of the IgG class must be relatively high and that the specific antigenic determinants recognized by the IgG antibody must be in close proximity. When pentameric IgM is bound to antigen on a target surface, it assumes the so-called stable configuration, in which at least three bind-ing sites for the C1q are exposed. Since IgG molecules have a lower valency, about 1000 of them are needed to ensure the initiation of the complement pathway as against only one IgM molecule. 2. C1q binding in the presence of calcium ions leads to activation of C1r and C1s. Activated C1s is an esterase that splits C4 into tw o fragments: a small soluble frag- ment (C4a) and a larger fragment (C4b). C4a has ana-phylatoxin activity, and C4b binds to cell membrane along with C1. C4b in the presence of Mg 2/H11001 splits C2 into C2a and C2b. The smaller fragment (C2b) diffuses away, while the larger fragment (C2a) remains attached to C4b. The resulting C4b2a complex possesses enzymatic activ-ity and is called C3 convertase, which converts C3 into an active form. 3. The C3 convertase activate thousands of C3 molecules and splits these molecules into C3a and C3b. A single C3 con vertase molecule can generate over 200 mol- ecules of C3b, resulting in tremendous amplification at this step of the sequence. The biological importance of activated C3b as well as C4b is that they are able to bind to C3b/C4b receptors (currently designated as CR1 receptors) present on almost all host cells, most notably phagocytes. The increased affinity of phagocytic cells for C3b (or iC3b)/C4b-coated particles is known as immune adherence. The latter is responsible for a significant enhancement of phagocytosis, which is one of the main defense mecha-nisms of the body. 4. Some of the C3b binds to C4b2a to form a trimolecu-lar complex to C6 and initiates formation of C5b-9 complex otherwise known as membrane attack complex (MAC).FIG. 15-1. Classical pathway of activation of Chapter 15 Key Points Membrane attack complex The formation of the MAC (Fig. 15-2) is the terminal sequence of all three different pathways including the classical pathway. All the three pathways converge at the step involving the for-mation of the MAC. The formation of the MAC involves the participation of the complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9. A complex of C5b, C6, and C7 is rst formed in the soluble phase and then attaches to the cell membrane through the hydrophobic amino acid groups of C7. The C7 becomes exposed as a consequence of the binding of C7 to the C5b-C6 complex. Released C5b67 complexes can insert into the membrane of nearby cells and mediate \"innocent-bystander\" lysis. Regulator proteins in human sera normally prevent this from occurring, but in certain diseases cell and tissue damage may occur due to this process of innocent-bystander lysis. The membrane-bound C5b-6-7 complex acts as a recep- tor for C8 and C9. C8, on binding to the complex, stabi-lizes the attachment of the complex to the foreign cell membrane. The C5b-8 complex acts as a catalyst for C9, which is a single chain glycoprotein with a tendency to polymerize spontaneously. 5. The C5b-8 complex on binding to C9 molecules under-goes polymerization, which finally ends in the f orma- tion of C5b-9 complex also known as MAC. The MAC forms a transmembrane channel of 100 \u00c5 diameter in the cell. This transmembrane channel allows the free exchange of ions between the cell and the surrounding medium. Due to the rapid influx of ions into the cell and their association with cytoplasmic proteins, the osmotic pressure rapidly increases inside the cell. This results in an influx of water, swelling of the cell, and, for certain cell types, rupture of the cell membrane and finally lysis (Fig. 15-3).Alternative Pathway of Complement Activation The alternative pathway was first described by Pillemer in 1954. It differs from the classical pathway in (a) the nature of activat-ing substances and (b) the sequence of events itself. The alter-native pathway is unique in not requiring antigen-antibody complexes to activate the complement. This pathway does not depend on antibody and does not involve the early complement components (C1, C2, and C4) for activation of the comple-ment. It, therefore, can be activated before the establishment of an immune response to the infecting pathogen (Fig. 15-4).C5b inserted and efflux of fluids and molecules Formation of MAC Cell lysis Microbe Lysed microbePore formation by multiple C9 FIG. 15-3.

Steps of activation of alternative pathway: The initial com-ponent of the alternative pathway involves four serum proteins: C3b, factor B, factor D, and properdin. 1. The C3b binds with factor B to form C3bB complex. The interaction betw een C3b and factor B is stabilized by Mg2/H11001, which is the only ion required for functional activation of the alternative pathway. Therefore, tests to discriminate between the two complement activation pathways are often based on the selective chelation of Ca 2/H11001 (to disrupt C1q, C1r2, and C1s2) and the addition of sufficient Mg2/H11001 to allow activation of the alternative pathway. 2. The C3bB is split into two fragments, Ba and Bb, by another serum protein called factor D or C3 proactiv e convertase. Since factor D has never been isolated in its proenzyme form, it is generally believed to be activated immediately upon leaving the hepatocyte where it is synthesized. The Ba is released into the medium and the Bb binds to C3b form-ing the C3bBb complex, which possesses the C3 convertase activity. 3. The C3bBb complex activates more C3, leading to the for-mation of more C3bBb, which in turn is capable of activat-ing C5 and the MAC. The C3bBb com plex has a half-life of only 5 minutes, but by binding with properdin it forms PC3bBb complex, which is relatively heat stable. 4. The alternative pathway then proceeds from C3 to produce finally the MA C, in the same way as occurs in the classical pathway. Lectin Pathway of Complement Activation The lectin pathway, as the name suggests, is triggered by lec-tins. Lectins are the proteins that recognize and bind to spe-cific carbohydrate targets. The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is one such protein that takes part in the lectin pathway of complement activation. MBL is a large serum protein that binds to nonreduced mannose, fructose, and glucosamine on bacterial and other cell surfaces with mannose-containing polysaccharides (mannans) (Fig. 15-5). The binding of MBL to in and C1s, respectively, and MBL is similar to C1q. Formation of the MBL/MASP-1/MASP-2 trimolecular complex results in activation of MASPs and subsequent cleavage of C4 into C4a and C4b. Subsequently, it proceeds to produce MAC in the same way as that occurs in the classical and alternative pathways. Differences between classical, alternative, and lectin pathways are summarized in Table 15-1. Regulation of Complement System Since the complement system involves the formation of many biologically active substances, there are many regula-tory systems to prevent unwarranted damage to the human host. The activities of the different complement components activated at each stage of the cascade are regulated by several C3 119 5/14/2012 11:56:28 AM120 IMMUNOLOGYSection II Chapter 15mechanisms. The following are regulators of the complement system:1. Level of antibody: The level of antibody itself is the rst regulatory step in the classical pathway. If antigen is not bound to the antibodies, the complement-binding sites on the heavy chains of IgG and IgM are unavailable to the C1 component of the complement. This means that complement is not acti-vated even if IgM and IgG are present in the blood at all times. However, when antigen binds with speci c antibodies, a con-formational shift occurs and that allows the C1 component to bind and initiate the cascade reaction.2. C1 inhibitors: These inhibitors play a critical role in limiting unnecessary complement activation. These prevent the formation and function of C1qrs complex by causing C1s to dissociate from C1qrs. The C1 inhibitors may also aid in the removal of the entire C1 complex from the antigen-antibody complexes.3. Other inhibitory substances: Multiple substances have inhibitory effects over different steps of the activation sequence of the classical pathway. These are considered to be host cell protective mechanisms. These mechanisms probably help to protect the host cells from the possible bystander damage initi-ated by activated complement fragments (C3b and C4b) being formed on and near its surface.4. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF): It is another inhibitory substance located in a large variety of host cell membranes. It is so termed because it can accelerate the dissociation of active C4b2a complexes, turning off their ability to activate native C3. In addition, DAF remains attached to membrane-bound C4b and C3b, and prevents the subsequent interac-tion with C2a and factor B, respectively. As a consequence, the two types of C3 convertases, C4b2a and C3bBb, are not formed; hence, the rate of C3 breakdown is reduced and the host cells are spared from complement-mediated membrane damage.5. Regulation of alternative pathway: The alternative path-way has its own set of regulatory proteins and mechanisms. It is mediated by the binding of factor H to C3b and cleavage of this complex-by speci c plasma inhibitor factor I, a protease. This reduces the amount of C5 convertase available. Biological Effects of Complement The main role of complement is to amplify the humoral immune response. The complement through its various prod-ucts participates in the inflammatory response, opsonization of antigen, viral neutralization, and clearance of immune complexes as follows: Chemotaxis C5a is a leukocytes or phagocytic cells. This substance causes leukocytes to migrate to a tissue in which an antigen-antibody reaction is taking place. At that site, a phagocytic cell recognizes opsonized particles and ingests them. C5a not only has a chemotactic effect on neutrophils, but also activates these cells causing their reversible aggregation and release of stored enzymes, including proteases. C5a also enhances the adhesiveness of neutrophils to the endothelium. Opsonization Complement plays an important role in opsonization of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Bacteria and viruses are easily phagocytosed by phagocytic cells in the presence of complement component C3b. This is because the receptors for the C3b component are present on the surface of many phagocytes. Hypersensitivity Reactions Complement participates in type II (cytotoxic) and type III (immune-complex) hypersensitivity reactions. The C3a, C4a, and C5a components stimulate degranulation of mast cells with release of mediators, such as histamine. The C3a frag-ments bind to receptors on basophils and mast cells and induce the release of stored vasoactive amines (e.g., histamine) and heparin. The release of histamine into the tissues results in increased capillary permeability and smooth muscle contrac-tion. Fluid is released into the tissue, thereby causing edema and swelling. There is some evidence that C3a and C5a may also act directly on endothelial cells, causing increased vascular perme-ability. The end result is very similar to the classical anaphy-lactic reaction that takes place when IgE antibodies bound to the membranes of mast cells and basophils react with the cor-responding antigens. For this reason, C3a Insertion of C5b-9 com-plex (MAC) into the cell membrane leads to killing or lysis of erythrocytes, bacteria, and tumor cells. The insertion of the MAC complex results in disruption of the mem-brane, there by leading to entry of water and electrolytes into the cell. Enhancement of Antibody Production The binding of C3b to the surface receptors on the activated B cells markedly enhances the production of antibodies in comparison to that of B cells activated by antigen alone. Hence, deficiency of C3b leads to reduced production of antibodies. Therefore, low concentration of both C3b and antibodies affects host defense, resulting in severe pyogenic infections. Chap-15.indd 120 5/14/2012 11:56:29 AMSection II Chapter 15COMPLEMENT SYSTEM 121 Deficiency of Complement Complement plays an important role in the well-being of humans. Deficiency of various components may result in many diseases as follows: 1. Inherited deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitors causes angio-edema. The low lev el of C1 esterase inhibitors leads to over- production of esterase. This leads to an increase in release of anaphylatoxins, which cause capillary permeability and edema. 2. Acquired deficiency of DAF results in an increase in com-plement-mediated hemolysis. The condition manifests clinically as paro xysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. 3. Inherited or acquired deficiency of C5-8 components greatly enhances susceptibility to Neisseria bactere- mia and other infections. Deficiency of C3 leads to severe recurrent pyogenic sinusitis and respiratory infections. 4. The synthesis of sufficient quantities of complement is reduced in the patients with severe liv er disease, such as chronic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis. These patients, therefore, are highly susceptible to infections caused by pyogenic bacteria.De ciency of complement components and diseases associ- ated with these complement de ciency are summarized in Table 15-2. Biosynthesis of Complement Various components of the complement are synthesized at vari-ous sites of the body. For example, C1 is synthesized in the intes-tinal epithelium, both C2 and C4 in the in the spleen, and C3, C6, and C9 in the liver. There is an increase in the level of C3, C4, C5, and C6 in the acute phase of inflam-mation. Complement along with some other plasma proteins known as acute phase reactants show a rise in acute inflammation. Quantitation of Complement Estimation of the highest dilutions of serum lysing sheep erythrocytes sensitized by antierythrocytic antibody comple-ment activity of the serum is a method frequently used to measure complement activities of the serum. Radial immuno-diffusion in agar is employed to measure complement in serum.Deficiency Disorder Salient features C1 esterase inhibitor Hereditary angioedema Transient but recurrent localized edema in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract C1q Associated with hypogammaglobulinemia and severe combined immunodeficiency diseaseRepeated infections C2 and C4 Similar to SLE Due to failure in clearance immune-mediated complexes C3 Severe recurrent pyogenic infections Streptococcus pneumoniae infections Bacteremia Gram-negative diplococci and toxoplasmosisTABLE 5/14/2012 11:56:29 AMMycobacterium Leprae43 16 Introduction The lymphoreticular system is a complex organization of cells of diverse morphology, distributed widely in different organs and tissues of the human body, and is responsible for immu-nity. It consists of lymphoid and reticuloendothelial compo-nents and is responsible for immune response of the host. The lymphoid cells, which include lymphocytes and plasma cells, are responsible for conferring specific immunity. On the other hand, the reticuloendothelial system, which con-sists of phagocytic cells and plasma cells, is responsible for nonspecific immunity. These cells kill microbial pathogens and other foreign agents, and remove them from blood and tissues. Lymphoid Tissues and Organs The specific immune response to antigen is of two types: (a) humoral or antibody-mediated immunity, mediated by antibodies produced by plasma cells; and ( b) cell-mediated immunity, mediated by sensitized lymphocytes. The immune system is organized into several special tissues, which are col-lectively termed lymphoid or immune tissues. The tissues that have evolved to a high degree of specificity of function are termed lymphoid organs . Lymphoid organs of lymphoid tissue in the submucosal spaces of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts. The lymphoid organs, based on their function, are classified into central (primary) and peripheral (secondary) lymphoid organs. Central (Primary) Lymphoid Organs Central or primary lymphoid organs are the major sites for lymphopoiesis. These organs have the ability to produce pro-genitor cells of the lymphocytic lineage. These are the organs in which precursor lymphocytes proliferate, develop, and differ-entiate from lymphoid stem cells to become immunologically competent cells. The primary lymphoid organs include thymus and bone marrow. In mammals, T cells mature in thymus and B cells in fetal liver and bone marrow. After acquiring immu-nological competency, the lymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs to induce appropriate immune response on exposure to antigens. Thymus Thymus is the first lymphoid organ to develop. It reaches its maximal size at puberty and then atrophies, with a significant decrease in both cortical and medullary cells and an increase in the total fat content of the organ. The thymus is a flat, bilobed organ situated above the heart. Each lobe is surrounded by a capsule and is divided into lobules, which are separated from each other by strands of connective tissue called trabeculae. Each lobule is organized into two compartments: cortex and medulla. The stroma of the organ is composed of dendritic cells, epithelial cells, and macrophages (Fig. 16-1, Color Photo 9). Cortex: It consists mainly of (a) cortical thymocytes, the immunologically immature T lymphocytes, and (b) a small number of macrophages and plasma cells. In addition, the cortex contains two subpopulations of epithelial cells, the epithelial nurse cells and the cortical epithelial cells, which form a network within the cortex. Medulla: It contains predominantly mature T lymphocytes and has a larger epithelial cell-to-lymphocyte ratio than the cor-tex. The concentric rings of squamous epithelial cells known as Hassall's corpuscles are found exclusively in the medulla.Thymus is the site where a large diversity of T cells is produced and so they can recognize and act against a myr-iad number of antigen-MHCs (major histocompatibility complexes). The thymus induces the death of those T cells that cannot recognize antigen-MHCs. It also induces death of those T cells that react with self-antigen MHC and pose a danger of causing autoimmune disease. More than 95% of all thymocytes die by apoptosis in the thymus without ever reaching maturity.Structure and Function of Immune System FIG. 16-1. A 5/14/2012 1:20:03 PMSection II Chapter 16STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM 123 Key Points Functions of the thymus: The thymus is the only clearly indi-vidualized primary lymphoid organ in mammals. It has many functions: Production of thymic lymphocytes is the primary function of the thymus. It is a major organ for proliferation of lym-phocytes in the body. It is believed to play a key role in determining the differen-tiation of T lymphocytes. The lymphocytes during matu-ration acquire new surface antigens ( Thy antigens) and are called as T lymphocytes or T cells (thymus dependent). The thymus confers immunological competence on these cells during their stay in the organ. Lymphocyte proliferation in thymus, unlike in the peripheral lymphoid organs, is not dependent on antigenic stimulus. The T lymphocytes are primarily responsible for cell- mediated immunity (CMI). The absence of thymus in neonatally thymectomized mice is associated with gross deficiency of CMI, resulting in lymphopenia, deficient graft rejection, and runting disease. Congenital aplasia of thymus in man in Di-George syndrome is another example of deficiency of CMI due to absence of thymus. Bone marrow Some lymphoid cells develop and mature within the bone mar-row and are referred to as B cells (B for bursa of Fabricius, or bone marrow). The function of bursa of Fabricius in birds is played by bone marrow in humans. Bone marrow is the site for prolifera-tion of stem cells and for the origin of pre-B cells and their matu-ration to become immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes. Immature B cells proliferate and differentiate within the bone marrow. Stromal cells within the bone marrow interact directly with the B cells and secrete various cytokines that are required for the development of B cells. Like thymic selection during T-cell maturation, a selection process within the bone marrow eliminates B cells with self-reactive antibody receptors. B lymphocytes develop their B-cell receptors (BCRs) by DNA rearrangement. They express auxiliary molecules, such as Ig/H9251 and Ig/H9252, and begin to express IgM on their surfaces before leaving the bone marrow. Subsequently, mature B lymphocytes also acquire C3 and Fc receptors on their surfaces. B lympho-cytes on their surfaces either bear IgM alone or in association with IgG or IgA depending upon the production of particular class of immunoglobulin. The B lymphocytes are transformed into plasma cells and secrete antibodies. B lymphocytes are primarily responsible for antibody-mediated immunity. Peripheral (Secondary) Lymphoid Organs Peripheral or secondary lymphoid organs consist of ( a) lymph nodes, (b) spleen, and (c) nonencapsulated structures, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT). These organs serve as the sites for interaction of mature lymphocytes with antigens. Lymph nodes The lymph nodes are extremely numerous and disseminated all over the body. They play a very important and dynamic role in the initial or inductive states of the immune response. Lymph nodes measure 1-25 mm in diameter and are surrounded by a connective tissue capsule. The lymph node has two main parts: cortex and medulla. The reticulum or framework of the lymph node is composed of phagocytes and specialized types of reticular or dendritic cells (Color Photo 10).Cortex: The cortex and the deep cortex, also known as para-cortical area, are densely populated by lymphocytes. Roughly spherical areas containing densely packed lymphocytes, termed primary lymphoid follicles or nodules, are found in the cortex. B and T lymphocytes are found in different areas in the cortex. The primary lymphoid follicles predominately contain B lymphocytes. They also contain macrophages, dendritic cells, and some T lymphocytes. The primary follicles are very densely packed with small lymphocytes, not actively involved in an immune response. The larger, less dense follicles, termed secondary follicles, are found in the cortex of a lymph node draining an area in which an infection has taken place. The secondary follicles contain clear germinal centers where B lym-phocytes actively divide as a result of antigenic stimulation. T lymphocytes are found predominantly in the deep cortex or paracortical area; for this reason, the paracortical area is des-ignated as T-dependent. Interdigitating cells are also present in this area, where they present antigen to T lymphocytes.Medulla: It is less densely populated and is composed mainly of medullary cords. These cords are elongated branching bands of the lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. They drain into the hilar efferent lymphatic vessels. Plasma cells are also found in the medullary cords. Following the period of division, there is a rigorous selection process in which more than 90% of these B cells die by apopto-sis or cell death. As antigen is carried into a regional node by the lymph, it is trapped, processed, and presented together with class II MHC molecules by interdigitating dendritic cells in the paracortex, resulting in the activation of T H cells. The initial activation of B cells is also thought to take place within the T-cell-rich paracortex. Once activated, T H and B cells form small foci consisting largely of pro- liferating B cells at the edges of the paracortex. Some B cells within the foci differentiate into plasma cells secreting IgM and IgG. Key Points Functions of the lymph nodes: Lymph nodes serve the following functions: They act as filter for the lymph, the fluid, and cellular content of the lymphocytic circulatory system. They also provide sites for mingling of lymphocytes, mono-cytes, and dendritic cells for initiation of immune responses. Most antigen-activated B cells divide and differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells in lymphoid follicles, but only a few B cells in the antigen-activated population find their way into germinal centers. Those that do, undergo one or more rounds of cell division during which the genes that encode their antibodies mutate at an unusually high rate. They phagocytose microbial pathogens and other foreign PMSection II Chapter 16124 IMMUNOLOGY Spleen The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ. It is a large, ovoid sec-ondary lymphoid organ situated high in the left abdominal cavity. The spleen parenchyma is heterogeneous and is composed of the white and the red pulp. It is surrounded by a capsule made up of connective tissue (Color Photo 11). The spleen unlike the lymph nodes is not supplied by lymphatic vessels. Instead, blood-borne antigens and lymphocytes are carried into the spleen through the splenic artery. The narrow central arterioles, which are derived from the splenic artery after multiple branchings, are surrounded by lymphoid tissue (periarteriolar lymphatic sheath). In the white pulp, T lymphocytes are found in the lymphatic sheath imme-diately surrounding the arteriole. B lymphocytes are primarily found in perifollicular area, germinal center, and mantle layer, which lie more peripherally relative to the arterioles. Key Points Functions of the spleen: The spleen plays a major role in: Mounting immune responses to antigens in the blood stream. The circulating antigens are trapped by the macro-phages present in the marginal zone. These macrophages then process the antigen, migrate deeper into the white pulp, and initiate the immune response by interacting with T and B lymphocytes. Filtering or clearing of (a) infectious organisms; (b) aged or defectively formed elements (e.g., spherocytes, ovalo-cytes); and (c) particulate matter from the peripheral blood. In addition, the spleen traps blood-borne antigens and microbes. The main filtering function is performed by the macrophages lining up the splenic cords. The effect of splenectomy on the immune response depends on the age at which the spleen is removed: In children, splenectomy often leads to an increased incidence of bacterial sepsis caused primarily by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. In adults, the adverse effects are less; although in some, it makes the host more susceptible to blood-borne bacterial infections. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) consist of the lymphoid tissues of the intestinal tract, genitourinary tract, tracheobronchial tree, and mammary glands. All of the MALT are noncapsulated and contain both T and B lymphocytes, and the latter predominate. Structurally, these tissues include clus-ters of lymphoid cells in tonsils, and Peyer's patches.Tonsils: These are present in the oropharynx and are predominantly populated by B lymphocytes. These are the sites of intense antigenic stimulation, as shown by the presence of numerous secondary follicles with germinal centers in the ton-sillar crypts.Peyer's patches: These are lymphoid structures that are found within the submucosal layer of the intestinal lining. The follicles of the Peyer's patches are extremely rich in B cells, which differentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells. Specialized epithelial cells, known as M cells, are found in abundance in the dome epithelia of Peyer's patches, particu-larly at the ileum. These cells take up small particles, virus, bacteria, etc., and deliver them to submucosal macrophages, where the engulfed material is processed and presented to T and B lymphocytes. Key Points MALTs play an important role in defense system of the human host. This is demonstrated by large population of antibody-producing plasma cells in MALT, whose number far exceeds that of plasma cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, when combined together. In addition to spleen and lymph nodes, MALTs facilitate interaction among circu-lating leukocytes. Lymphatic Circulatory System Leukocytes and their products use two circulatory systems: cardiovascular system and the lymphatic circulatory system. The cardiovascular system is responsible for circulation of blood throughout the body. Peripheral blood is \"filtered\" by the spleen and liver. Organisms and antigens that enter directly into the systemic circulation are trapped in these two organs, of which the spleen plays the most important role as a lymphoid organ. The lymphatic circulatory system, on the other hand, is an extensive capillary network that collects lymph, a clear watery fluid containing leukocytes and cellular debris, from various organs and tissues. Cleared lymph originating from below the diaphragm and the upper left half of the body drains via efferent lymphatics into the thoracic duct for subsequent drainage into the left innominate vein. Cleared lymph originating from the right side above the diaphragm drains into the right lymphatic duct, which subsequently drains into the origin of the right innominate vein. The same routes are followed by the lympho-cytes stimulated and produced in the lymph nodes, or periph-eral lymphoid tissues, which eventually reach the systemic circulation. Cells of the Lymphoreticular System It is essential for the immune system to distinguish its own molecules, cells, and organs (self) from those of foreign origin (nonself). The innate immunity does this by express-ing germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors on the surface of its cells, receptors that recognize structures on potentially invasive microorganisms. The adaptive immunity, on the other hand, makes use of somatically gen-erated epitope-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs). These receptors are produced randomly and fresh within each individual T and B lymphocytes by gene Chap-16.indd 124 5/14/2012 1:20:04 PMSection II Chapter 16STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM 125 FIG. 16-2.

The cells involved in the adaptive immune responses are (a) lymphocytes, (b) antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and (c) effector cells that function to eliminate antigens. Lymphocytes The lymphocytes occupy a very special place among the leukocytes. They participate in immune reactions due to their ability to interact specifically with antigenic substances and to react to nonself antigenic determinants. They also contribute to the memory of the immune system. The lymphocytes consist of heterogeneous populations of cells that differ greatly from each other in terms of origin, lifespan, preferred areas of settlement within the lymphoid organs, surface structure, and function. They differentiate from stem cells in the fetal liver, bone marrow, and thy-mus into two main functional classes: B cells and T cells. They are found in the peripheral blood and in all lymphoid tissues. The lymphocytes are classified depending upon where they undergo their development and proliferation: ( a) T lympho- cytes or T cells undergoing development in the thymus or (b) B lymphocytes, or B cells undergoing development in the bone marrow. Differences between T cells and B cells are summarized in Table 16-1. Thymus-derived cells T lymphocytes, or T cells, are so designated because the thymus plays a key role in their differentiation. They are the key play-ers in adaptive immunity. They participate directly in immune Chap-16.indd 125 5/14/2012 1:20:04 PMSection II Chapter 16126 IMMUNOLOGY responses as well as in orchestrating and regulating activities of other cells. T cells constitute 65-80% of the circulating pool of small lymphocytes. They are found in the inner subcortical regions but not in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes. They have a longer lifespan (months or years) than B lymphocytes. They are stimulated to divide on exposure to certain mito-gens, such as phytohemagglutinin or concavalin A, the T cells can be stimulated to divide. Most human T cells have receptors for sheep erythrocytes on their surface and have the ability to form rosettes with them; this property is made use of for identifying T cells in a mixed population of cells. The T lymphocytes perform two important groups of func-tions as follows:Regulation of immune responses: Regulatory function is mediated primarily by helper (CD4 /H11001) T cells, which produce interleukins.Various effector are mediated primarily by cytotoxic (CD8 /H11001) T cells, which kill allografts, tumor cells, and virus-infected cells. Depending on whether they have CD4 or CD8 proteins on their surface, T cells are subdivided into two major groups: CD4/H11001 T cells and CD8/H11001 T cells. Mature T cells have either CD4 or CD8 proteins, but never both. CD4/H11001 T cells CD4 cells are also known as helper T (Th) cells. They consti- tute about 65% of peripheral T cells and are found mainly in the thymic medulla, tonsils, and blood. CD4 displayed on the surfaces of these T cells recognize a nonpeptide-binding portion of MHC class II molecules. Hence, CD4 /H11001 T cells are restricted to the recognition of pMHC class II complexes. Helper T lymphocytes are involved in the induction and reg-ulation of immune responses. CD4 /H11001 T cells perform follow- ing helper functions: They help B cells to be transformed into plasma cells. They help CD8/H11001 T cells to become activated cytotoxic T cells. They help macrophages to mediate delayed type hypersen-sitivity reactions. The main functions of helper T cells are summarized in Box 16-1. 1. Help in the antigen-specific activation of B cells and effector T cells. 2. Th-1 cytokines activate cytotoxic inflammatory and delayed hypersensitivity reactions. 3. Th-2 cells help in the production of interleukins which encourage production of antibodies especially IgE. 4. Th-2 cytokines are associated with regulation of strong antibody and allergic responses.Box 16-1 Main function of helper T cellsAll these functions are mediated by Th-1 cells and Th-2 two subpopulations cells: cells activate cytotoxic T cells by producing IL-2. They help in the development of hypersensitivity responses by producing primarily IL-2 and gamma interferon. The Th-2 cells perform B-cell helper function by producing primarily IL-4 and IL-5. The balance between Th-1 and Th-2 cells is regulated by gamma interferon and IL-12. Gamma interferon inhibits the production of Th-2 cells, whereas IL-12 increases the num-ber of Th-1 cells, thereby increasing host defense against microorganisms that are controlled by a delayed hypersensi-tivity reaction. Table 16-2 shows a comparison of Th-1 and Th-2 cells. CD8/H11001 T cells CD8/H11001 T cells are also known as cytotoxic T (Tc) and suppres- sor T (Ts) cells. They account for approximately one-third of all mature CD3 /H11001 cells. They are found mainly in the human bone marrow and gut lymphoid tissue. CD8/H11001 T glycoprotein displayed on the surfaces of these T cells recognize a nonpeptide-binding portion of MHC class I molecules. Hence, CD8 /H11001 T cells are restricted to the recognition of pMHC class I complexes. CD8/H11001 T cells perform mainly cytotoxic functions. They kill (a) virus-infected cells, (b) allograft cells, and (c) tumor cells. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity is an apoptotic process that appears to be mediated by two different pathways: (i) One pathway involves the release of proteins known as perf orins, which insert themselves in the target cell membranes forming channels. These channels allow the diffusion of enzymes (granzymes, which are serine ester-ases) into the cytoplasm. The exact way in which gran-zymes induce apoptosis has not been established, but granzyme-induced apoptosis is Ca 2/H11001-dependent. (ii) The other pathway depends on signals delivered by the cytoto xic cell to the target cell, which require cell-to-cell contact. This pathway is Ca2/H11001 independent. The ratio of CD4/H11001 and CD8/H11001 T cells is approximately 2:1 in normal human peripheral blood.

Differences between CD4 and CD8 T cells are summarized in Table 16-3. Activation of T cells Recognition of complex on the surface of APCs, such as mac-rophages and dendritic cells, consisting of both the antigen and a class II MHC protein by TCR present on T cells, is most important for activation of helper T cells. Two signals are required to activate T cells: The interaction of the antigen and the MHC protein with the T-cell-receptor-specific antigen is the first signal required in the activation of process. IL-1 secreted by the macrophages is also necessary for efficient helper T-cell activation. A costimulatory signal is the second signal required for activation of T cells. In this signal, B7 protein present on the APC must interact with CD28 protein on the helper T cells. Following the costimulatory signal, IL-2 is produced by helper T cells, which is most crucial in producing a helper T cell capable of performing their regulatory, effector, and memory functions. After activation of the T cells, a new different protein called CTLA-4 appears on the cell surface of T cells and binds to B7 by displacing CD28. The interaction of CTLA-4 with B7 inhibits T-cell activation by blocking IL-2 synthesis. This makes T cells to remain in a quiescent state and thereby plays an important role in T-cell homeostasis. On the other hand, mutant T cells that lack CTLA-4 and hence cannot be deactivated participate more frequently in autoimmune diseases. Memory T cells Memory T cells, as the name suggests, confer host immunity with the ability to respond rapidly and vigorously for many years after the initial exposure to a microbe or other foreign substances. The memory produced against a specific antigen shows the following characteristics: 1. Memory cells live for many years or have the capacity to reproduce them. 2. A large number of memory cells are produced, and so secondar y response is enhanced and is greater than the primary response. 3. Memory cells are activated by small quantity of antigens and req uire less costimulation than do the na\u00efv e and unac- tivated T cells. 4. Activated memory cells produce greater amounts of interleukins than do na\u00efve T cells when they are f irst activated. T-cell receptor T- cell receptor (TCR) for antigen consists of two polypep-tides: alpha and beta. These two peptides are associated with CD3 proteins. Each T cell has a unique TCR on its surface, thereby implying that hundreds of millions of different T cells occur in each person. Activated T cells as well as activated B cells produce large number of cells specific for those antigens. T-cell alpha and beta polypeptides show many similarities to immunoglobulin heavy chain in the following ways: The genes coding for T-cell polypeptides are formed by rearrangement of multiple regions of DNA. There are V (variable), D (diversity), J (joining), and C (con-stant) segments that rearrange to provide diversity, thereby resulting in more than 10 7 different receptor proteins. RAG-1 and RAG-2 are the two genes that encode the recombinase enzymes that catalyze these gene rearrange-ments and are similar in T cells and B cells. T cells, however, differ from immunoglobulins in the following ways: T cells have two chains rather than four chains in immunoglobulins. T cells recognize antigen only in conjunction with MHC proteins, whereas immunoglobulins recognize free antigens. Effect of superantigens on T cells Certain proteins such as staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxins, and certain viral proteins, such as mouse mammary tumor virus, are called superantigens. These are called \"super\" because they activate a large number of helper T cells unlike \"antigens\", which activate one or a few helper cells. The superantigens play a very important role in patho- genesis of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In this condition, toxic shock syndrome toxin produced by S. aureus binds directly to class II MHC pro- teins without internal processing of the toxin. Subsequently, this toxin interacts with variable component of the beta chain (V/H9252) of the T-cell receptor of many T cells. The activation of T cells results in release of the interleukins, IL-2 from the T cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from macrophages. These interleukins are responsible for many of the clinical presenta-tions observed in toxin-mediated staphylococcal diseases. Effector functions of T cells T cells perform two important functions: (a) cytotoxicity and (b) delayed hypersensitivity.TABLE 16-3Differences between helper T cells (CD4) and cytotoxic T (CD8) cells Helper T cells Cytotoxic T cells Carries CD4 marker Carries CD8 cells Helps or induces immune responsesPredominantly cytotoxic Recognize antigen in associa tion with class II MHCRecognize antigen in association with class I MHC Macrophages are activated to kill intracellular microorganisms by secreting and tumor Chapter 16128 T cells is required primar-ily to destroy virus-infected cells and tumor cells. It also plays an important role in graft rejection. The cytotoxic T cells kill the virus-infected cells: (a) By inserting perforins and granzymes (degrading enzymes) into the inf ected cell, (b) By the F as-Fas ligand (FasL) interaction, and (c) By antibody-dependent cellular A. By inserting perf orins and granzymes: Perforins are inserted into the cells, leading to formation of a channel through the membrane. This results in the loss of cell contents and finally death of the cell. Granzymes are proteins that degrade proteins in the cell membrane, which also results in loss of cell contents. These enzymes also activate caspases that causes apoptosis, resulting in cell death.B. By ligand (FasL) Cytotoxic the FasL interaction. FasL is a pro-tein which is expressed on the surface of many cells. When a cytotoxic TCR recognizes an epitope on the surface of virus-infected cells, FasL appears on the cytotoxic T cells. When Fas and FasL interact, it results in death or apoptosis of target cells. NK cells can also kill target cells by FasL interaction.C. By antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC): Virus-infected cells can also be killed by ADCC. In this process, target cells are killed by a combination of IgG and phagocytic cells. The antibody bound to the surface of the infected cells is rec-ognized by IgG receptor on the surface of phagocytic cells (e.g., macrophages, NK cells) and the infected cell is killed. After killing of the virus-infected cells, the cytotoxic T cells are not damaged and can continue to kill other cells infected with the same virus. However, the cytotoxic T cells do not have any effect on free virus; they have effect only on virus-infected cells. The cytotoxic T cells kill the tumor cells by a phenomenon called immune surveillance . New antigens are usually developed on surface of many tumor cells. These antigens bound to class I proteins are recognized by cytotoxic T cells, which are activated to proliferate by IL-2. The resultant clone of cytotoxic T cells can kill the tumor cells. The cytotoxic T cells also play an important role in graft rejec- tion. In this process, cytotoxic CD8 cells recognize the class I MHC molecules on the surface of the foreign cells. Helper CD4 cells recognize the foreign class II molecules on certain cells, such macrophages and lymphocytes in the graft. The activated helper cells secrete IL-2, which stimulates the cytotoxic cells to produce a clone of cells, which kills the cells in the allograft.Delayed hypersensitivity: The CD4 cells particularly the Th-1 subset cells and macrophages mediate the delayed hypersensitiv-ity reactions against antigens of many intracellular pathogens. The CD4 cells produce interleukins, such as gamma interferon, macrophage activation factor, and macrophage inhibition fac-tor, which mediate delayed reactions. Th-1 cells produce IL-12-gamma interferon, which activates macrophages and thereby enhances the ability of the macro-phages to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The gamma inter-feron, therefore, plays an important role in the ability of host immunity to control infections caused by M. tuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and other intracellular microbes. A deficiency of CMI makes the person highly susceptible to infection by these microorganisms. Regulatory functions of T cells T cells play key role in regulating antibody production and in suppression of certain immune responses. 1. Regulation of antibody production: Production of anti- bodies by B cells ma y be (a) T-cell dependent, requiring the participation of helper T cells (T-cell-dependent response), or (b) non-T-cell dependent (T-cell-independent response). In the T-cell-dependent response, all the classes of immuno- globulins, such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgD, are synthesized. The T-cell-dependent response produces memory B cells. In the non-T-cell dependent response (T-cell-independent response), only IgM antibody is synthesized. This response does not produce any memory cells. Hence, a secondary antibody response does not occur. In this response, the multivalent macromolecules, such as bacterial capsule polysaccharide are not effectively processed and presented by APCs; hence these do not activate helper T cells. This is because polysaccharides do not bind to class II MHC pro-teins, whereas peptide antigens do. 2. Stimulation of helper and cytotoxic T cells to partici-pate in the CMI: In CMI, the antigen is processed by mac- rophages and is presented in conjunction with class II MHC molecules on the surface. These interact with the receptor on the helper T cells, which is then activated to produce IL-2, a T-cell growth factor that stimulates the specific helper and cytotoxic T cells to grow and participate in the CMI. 3. Suppression of certain immune responses: T cells ha ve been shown to inhibit several immune-mediated diseases in animals. Regulatory T cells (TR), also called suppressor T cells, is a subset of T cells and are associated with the suppression of certain immune responses. TR cells also called suppressor T cells are characterized by possessing CD25 marker and comprise 5-10% of the CD4 /H11001 cells. The exact mechanism by which the regulatory cells suppress the immune response is not known. Imbalance in numbers or activity between CD4 and CD8 cells also leads to impair-ment of the cellular immune response of the host. Bone marrow-derived cells The bone marrow-derived lymphocytes are known as B lym-phocytes or B cells. Plasma cells are derived from mature B cells. Both B cells and plasma cells synthesize and secrete immunoglobulin. B cells B lymphocytes or B cells are so designated because the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid organ located close to the caudal end of the gut in birds, plays a key role in their differentiation. A mammalian equivalent of the bursa is yet to be found. Here the early stages of maturation of these lymphocytes occur in the bone marrow. Chap-16.indd 128 5/14/2012 1:20:05 PMSection II Chapter 16STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM 129 Key Points Nearly 30% of the recirculating small lymphocytes are com-posed of B cells. The B cells have a short lifespan of days or weeks. Nearly 109 B cells are produced every day. B cells are found in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes, in the white pulp of the spleen, and in the MALT. B cells perform two important functions. First, they differ-entiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies. Second, they can present antigen to helper T cells. Origin of B cells: The clonal selection theory explains the ori-gin of antibody formation. According to this postulation, each immunologically competent B cell possesses receptor for either IgM or IgD that can combine with one antigen or closely related antigens. After binding of the antigen, the B cell is activated to proliferate and form a clone of cells. Selected B cells are trans-formed to plasma cells that secrete antibodies specific for the antigen. Plasma cells synthesize the immunoglobulin with the same antigenic specificity as those carried by activated B cells. The same clonal selection also occurs with T cells. B cell precursors, during embryogenesis, first proliferate and develop in the fetal liver. From there, they migrate to the bone marrow, the main site of B-cell maturation in the adults. Unlike T cells, they do not require the thymus for maturation. The Pre-B cells have only /H9262 heavy chains in the cytoplasm but do not have surface immunoglobulins and light chains. Pre-B cells are found in the bone marrow, while B cells are found in the circulation. B cells mature in two phases: Antigen-independent phase, which consists of stem cells and pre-B cells Antigen-dependent phase, which consists of the cells, such as activated B cells and plasma cells that proliferate on inter-actions of antigen with B cells. B cells possess surface IgM, which acts as a receptor for antigen. Some B cells may also carry on their surface IgD as receptor for the antigen. There are many other molecules expressed on the surface of the B cells, which serve different functions. A few of them are B220, class II MHC molecules, CR1 and CR2, CD40, etc.Activation of B cells: Activation of B cells to produce the full range of antibodies first requires recognition of the epitope by the T-cell-antigen receptor and the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by the helper T cells. In addition, it also requires other costimu-latory interactions of CD28 on the T cells with B7 on the B cells. The CD28-B7 interaction is essential to produce IL-2. It also includes CD40L on the T cells, which must interact with CD40 on the B cells. The CD40L-CD40 interaction is essential for class switching from IgM to IgG and for switching between other immunoglobulin classes to take place.Effector functions of B cells: Production of many plasma cells is the end result of activation of B cells. The plasma cells in turn produce large amounts of immunoglobulins specific for the epitope of the antigen. Some activated B cells also produce memory cells, which remain in a stage of quiescence for months or years. Most memory B cells have surface IgG that acts as the antigen receptor, but some even have surface IgM. These quiescent memory cells are activated rapidly on reexposure to antigen. Memory T cells produce interleukins that facilitate antibody production by the memory B cells. The presence of these cells is responsible for the rapid appearance of antibody in the secondary immune responses. Antigen-presenting cells Antigen presenting cells (APCs) include (a) macrophages and (b) dendritic cells. Macrophages The mononuclear phagocytic system consists of monocytes circulating in the blood and macrophages in the tissues. The monocyte is considered a leukocyte in transit through the blood, which becomes a macrophage when fixed in a tissue. Monocytes and macrophages as well as granulocytes are able to ingest par-ticulate matter (microorganisms, cells, inert particles) and for this reason are said to have phagocytic functions. The phago-cytic activity is greater in macrophages, particularly after activa-tion by soluble mediators released during immune responses, than in monocytes. Differentiation of a monocyte into a tissue macrophage involves a number of changes as follows: 1. The cell enlarges 5-10 folds. 2. Its intracellular organelles increase in number and complexity. 3. It acquires increased phagocytic ability. 4. It produces higher levels of hydrolytic enzymes. 5. It begins to secrete a variety of soluble factors. Macrophage-like cells ser ve different functions in different tissues and are named according to their tissue location. Examples include (a) alveolar macrophages in the lung, (b ) histiocytes in connective tissues, (c ) Kupffer cells in the liver, (d ) mesangial cells in the kidney, (e) microglial cells in the brain, and (f ) osteoclasts in the bone. For their participation in the immune reaction, the macro- phages need to be stimulated and reach an \"activated state.\" Macrophages can be activated by various cytokines, compo-nents of the bacterial cell wall, and mediators of the inflam-matory response. Gamma interferon produced by helper T cells is a potent activator of macrophages and is secreted by various cells in response to appropriate stimuli. Bacterial lipopolysaccha-rides (endotoxin), bacterial peptidoglycan, and bacterial DNA are the substances that also activate macrophages. Activated macrophages are more potent than normal macro-phages in many ways, such as having greater phagocytic abil-ity and increased ability to kill ingested microbes. They are better APCs, and they activate T-cell response in a more effec-tive manner. By secreting various cytotoxic proteins, they help in eliminating a broad range of pathogens, including virus-infected cells, tumor cells, and intracellular bacteria. Functions of macrophages: Macrophages perform three main functions: (a) phagocytosis, (b) antigen presentation, and (c) cytokine production Phagocytosis of bacteria, viruses, and other for- eign particles is the most important function of macrophages. The macrophages on their cell surfaces have Fc receptors that interact with Fc component of the IgG, thereby facilitating ingestion of the opsonized organisms. They also have recep-tors for C3b, another important opsonin. After ingestion, the phagosome containing the microbe fuses with a lysosome. The microbe within the phagolysosome is killed by reactive oxygen, reactive nitrogen compounds, and lysosomal enzymes.2. Antigen presentation: After ingestion and degradation of foreign materials, the fragments of antigen are presented on the macrophage cell surface in conjunction with class II MHC proteins for interaction with the TCR of CD4 /H11001 helper T cells. Degradation of the foreign protein is stopped following the association of antigen with the class II MHC proteins in the cytoplasm. This is followed by transportation of the complex to the cell surface by transporter proteins.3. Cytokine production: Macrophages and IL-8. IL-1 plays an important role in activation of helper T cells, while TNF plays as important mediator in inflammatory reactions. IL-8 attracts neutrophils and T cells to the site of infection. Dendritic cells Dendritic cells are so named because of their many long, nar-row processes that resemble neuronal dendrites, which make them very efficient at making contacts with foreign materials. They are primarily present in the skin (e.g., Langerhans cells) and the mucosa, from where they migrate to local lymph nodes for presentation of antigen to helper T cells. Key Points Dendritic cells are very important for presentation of the antigen to T cells during primary immune response. They are bone marrow-derived cells that express class II MHC proteins and present antigen to CD4 + T cells. They have little or no phagocytic activity. They also serve as professional APCs, although macro-phages and B cells are the major APCs. Four types of dendritic cells are known: (i ) Langerhans cells, (ii) cells, (iii) myeloid cells, and (iv) lymphoid dendritic cells. All these cells constitutively express high levels of both class II MHC molecules and members of the costimulatory B7 family. Following microbial invasion or during inflamma-tion, mature and immature forms of Langerhans cells and inter-stitial dendritic cells migrate into draining lymph nodes, where they make the critical presentation of antigen to T H cells, which is required for the initiation of responses by those key cells. Follicular dendritic cells Follicular dendritic cells are similar to the dendritic cells except for their sites of presence and functions. These cells are pres-ent in B-cell-containing germinal centers of the follicles in the spleen and lymph nodes. These cells do not present antigen to helper T cells, but combine with antigen-antibody complexes by Fc receptors found on their surfaces. Effector cells that function to eliminate antigens Plasma cells Plasma cells originate from terminally differentiated B cells. Plasma cells are oval or egg-shaped structures characterized by a stellate (star-like pattern) nucleus, nonstaining Golgi, and basophilic cytoplasm. The main function of the plasma cells is to produce and secrete all the classes of immunoglobulins into the fluids around the cells. They secrete thousands of antibody molecules per second, which are specific for the epitope of the antigen for a few days and then die. They, however, do not express membrane immunoglobulins. They divide very poorly, if at all, and are usually found in the bone marrow and in the perimucosal lymphoid tissues. They have a short lifespan of 30 days during which they produce large quantities of immunoglobulins. Natural killer cells Natural killer (NK) cells are morphologically described as large granular lymphocytes. These cells are called natural killer cells due to their ability to kill certain virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their activities are not enhanced by exposure and are not specific for any virus. NK cells comprise approximately 5-10% of peripheral lymphocytes and are found in spleen and peripheral blood. Key Points They lack both T cell (CD3) and B cell (surface immuno-globulin) markers. They lack immunologic memory and unlike cytotoxic T cells do not have any TCRs, and killing of target cells does not require recognition of MHC proteins. These cells do not carry antigen receptors of any kind, but can recognize antibody molecules bound to target cells and destroy those cells using the same general mechanisms involved on T-lymphocyte cytotoxicity (ADCC). They also have a recognition mechanism that allows them to destroy tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Features Mechanism Phagocytosis Ingestion and killing of microbes in phagolysosome Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activitiesOxygen-dependent killing : by superoxides, nitric and hydrogen peroxideOxygen-independent killing: by tumor necrosis lysozyme, and hydrolytic enzymes processing Phagocytic PMSection II Chapter 16STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM 131 Properties of NK cells are summarized in Box 16-2. NK cells develop within the bone marrow and lack TCR, but possess another set of receptors called killer activation recep-tors and killer inhibition receptors. They also posses NK T cells, another subset of T cells, which share some functional char-acteristics with NK cells. These NK T cells unlike NK cells are stimulated by lipids, glycolipids, and hydrophobic peptides presented by a nonclassical class I molecule CD1D and secrete large amounts of cytokines, especially IL-4. The main functions of the NK cells are to kill virus-infected cells and tumors. They do so by secreting cytotoxins, such as perforins and granzymes similar to those of cytotoxic T lym-phocytes and also by FasL-mediated apoptosis. They kill the viruses without presence of specific antibodies but by a mech-anism called ADCC. Both IL-12 and gamma interferons are potent activators of NK cells (Box 16-3). Granulocytes Granulocytes are a collection of white blood cells with seg-mented or lobulated nuclei and granules in their cytoplasm, which are visible with special stains. The granulocytes are classified as neutrophils, eosinophils, or basophils on the basis of cellular morphology and cytoplasmic-staining characteristics. Both neutrophils and eosinophils are phagocytic, whereas basophils are not. Eosinophils play an important role in defense against parasitic infections, though their phagocytic role is significantly lower than neutrophils. Basophils, on the other hand, are nonphagocytic granulocytes that function by releasing pharmacologically active substances from their cyto-plasmic granules. These substances play a major role in certain allergic responses. Mast cells are the other granulocytic cells that have a role in the immune system. These cells are found in a wide variety of tissues, including the skin, connective tissues of various organs, and mucosal epithelial tissue of the respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. Like circulating basophils, these cells have large numbers of cytoplasmic granules that contain histamine and other pharmacologically active substances. Mast cells, together with blood basophils, play an important role in the development of allergies. Major Histocompatibility Complex The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was first detected as the genetic locus encoding the glycoprotein molecules (transplantation antigens) responsible for the rapid rejection of tissue grafts transplanted between geneti-cally nonidentical individuals. Gorer in 1930 was the first to identify the antigens responsible for allograft rejection that led to the discovery of major histocompatible complex. He demonstrated two blood group antigens (antigen 1 and anti-gen 2) in mice. Antigen 1 was found in all strains of mice, while antigen 2 was found in certain strains of mice and was responsible for allograft rejection. This was named H2 anti-gen and was found to be the major histocompatible antigen. This antigen was coded for by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes called the MHC, named as H-2 complex. Histocompatible antigen denotes the cell surface antigens that induce immune responses to an incompatible host, result-ing in allograft rejection. The MHC in humans is known as human leukocyte antigens (HLA) complex . In humans, these alloantigens are present on the surface of leukocytes and are called HLA and the set of genes encoding for them is named the HLA complex. Carbohydrate antigens of erythrocytes (blood groups) and glycoprotein antigens of cell membranes are the two major transplantation antigens of humans. Snell, Dauseset, and Benacerraf (1980) were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work on MHC and genetic control of immune responses. HLA Complex In humans, the HLA complex of genes is located on short arm of chromosome 6 containing several genes that are critical to immune function (Fig. 16-3). The HLA complex of genes is clas-sified into three classes as follows: 1. Large granular lymphocytes. 2. Lack T-cell receptor, CD3 proteins, and surface IgM and IgD. 3. Prior exposure does not increase the activity. 4. Thymus is not required for development. 5. Number remains normal in severe combined immunodeficiency disease.Box 16-2 Properties of natural killer cells 1. Kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells. 2. Nonspecific killing of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. 3. Killing is independent of antigen presentation by MHC proteins. 4. Mechanism of killing is by perforins and granzymes, which cause apop tosis of t arget cell. 5. Killing is activated by failure of a cell to present antigen with class I MHC or by reduction of class I MHC pro teins on the cell sur faceBox 16-3 Functions arm of chromosome 6 FIG. 16-3. A schematic diagram of HLA complex. Chap-16.indd 131 PMSection II Chapter 16132 HLA-B, 2. Class II: HLA-DR, HLA -DQ, and HLA-DP. All of these are present within HLA-D region of HLA complex. 3. Class III: Complement loci that encode f or C2, C4, and factor B of complement system and TNFs alpha and beta. A locus means the position where a particular gene is located on the chromosome. HLA loci are usually multiallelic, mean-ing that genes present on the locus can be any one of several alternative forms. There are 24 alleles at HLA-A locus and 50 at HLA-B locus. Each allele expresses for a distinct antigen. HLA system is pleomorphic and every person inherits one set of HLA genes from each parent. The official Committee of the WHO has recommended a set of guidelines for nomenclature of the HLA system. Recognized alleles and their corresponding antigens are indicated by alphabet(s) and a number (e.g., HLA-A1, HLA-DR7, etc.). The HLA genes encode a variety of enzymes and structural molecules essential for the activation and function of B and T cells. The genes encode MHC proteins that are classified into three groups or classes known as the class I, class II, and class III molecules. MHC class I molecules These are glycoproteins found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells in the body. Class I proteins are encoded by the HLA-A, -B, and -C loci. Approximately 20 different proteins are encoded by allelic genes at the A locus, 40 at the B locus, and 8 at the C locus (Table 16-5). The complete class I is composed of a transmembrane glycoprotein of 45,000 Da, heavy chain, noncovalently associated with a /H9252 2-microglobulin (a non-HC- encoded polypeptide of MW 12,000 Da). The heavy chain like that of an immunoglobulin molecule has a variable and con-stant region. The variable region is highly pleomorphic. The polymorphism of these molecules is important in the recogni-tion of self and nonself. The constant region of the heavy chain binds with the CD8 proteins of the cytotoxic T cells. Class I pro-teins are involved in graft rejection and cell-mediated cytolysis. MHC class II molecules These are glycoproteins and unlike class I proteins, they have a restricted tissue distribution. They are chiefly found on macrophages, B cells, and other APCs, such as dendritic cells of the spleen and Langerhans cells of the skin. Their expression on other cells (e.g., endothelial cells) can be induced by gamma interferon. They are highly polymorphic glycoproteins composed of two noncovalently associated transmembrane glycoproteins of MW of about 33,000 and 29,000 Da. Class II proteins are encoded by the genes on the HLA-D locus. This locus retains control of immune responsive-ness, and different allelic forms of these genes confer striking differences in the ability to mount an immune response against a given antigen. The class II MHC locus also includes genes encoding proteins involved in antigen processing, e.g., transporter associated with antigen pro-cessing (TAP). Class II proteins are primarily responsible for the graft-versus-host response and the mixed leukocyte response. MHC class III molecules The class III MHC locus encodes complement proteins (C2, C4) of the classical pathways, properdin and factor B of the alterna-tive pathway, and several cytokines. Biologic Importance of MHC It is now known that MHC molecules bind peptide antigens and present them to T cells. Thus, these transplantation anti-gens are responsible for antigen recognition by the TCR. In this respect, the TCR is different from antibody. Antibody molecules interact with antigen directly; the TCR only recognizes antigen presented by MHC mol-ecules on another cell, the APC. The TCR is specific for antigen, but the antigen must be presented on a self-MHC molecule. The TCR is also specific for the MHC molecule. If the anti-gen is presented by another allelic form of the MHC mol-ecule in vitro (usually in an experimental situation), there is no recognition by the TCR. This phenomenon is known as MHC restriction. Peptide antigens associated with class I MHC molecules are recognized /H11001 cytotoxic T class II-associated peptide antigens are recognized by CD4/H11001 helper T cells.

The methods com-monly used in the laboratory include (a ) molecular methods using DNA sequence, (b ) serological assays, and (c ) mixed lym- phocyte culture (MLC) techniques. All these methods are used to determine the haplotype, i.e., the class I and class II alleles on both chromosomes of both the donor and recipient. DNA probe and PCR are highly specific and sensitive meth- ods used to detect the different alleles. Serological assays using a battery of antibodies specific for a different class I and class II proteins are also used to demonstrate the alleles. If these two methods fail to provide sufficient data, then additional infor-mation can be obtained by performing the MLC technique, also known as mixed lymphocyte reaction.Mixed lymphocyte reaction: This test is performed by using stimulator lymphocytes from a potential donor, which are first killed by irradiation. Then it is mixed with live responder lymphocytes from the recipient. The resultant mixture is then incubated in cell culture to allow DNA syn-thesis, which is detected by adding tritiated thymidine. The more the amount of DNA synthesis in the responder cells, the more foreign are the class II MHC protein of donor cells. Therefore, a large amount of DNA synthesis indicates that class II (HLA-D) MHC proteins of donor and recipients are not similar. This shows an unsatisfactory match between donor and recipients, thereby graft is likely to be rejected. Least production of DNA suggests the best donor and a good match between the donor and recipients. HLA typing is carried out: usually before tissue transplantation, for determination of paternity in case of dispute, and for finding association of HLA with diseases, such as association of HLA-B27 with ankylosing spondylitis Leprae43 Immune Response17 Introduction The adoptive immune system is developed in a host primarily to protect the host from harmful effects of pathogens and other foreign substances. The adoptive response can be antibody- mediated (humoral), cell-mediated (cellular), or both. An encounter with a microbial or viral agent usually elicits a complex variety of responses. There are two main sites where pathogens may reside in an infected host\u2014extracellularly in tissue spaces or intracellularly within a host cell; the immune system has different ways of dealing with pathogens at these sites. Humoral immunity acts mainly against extracellular Humoral Immunity Humoral immunity is based on the action of antibodies and complement. It is directed primarily against: Extracellular bacteria, in particular exotoxin-producing bacteria, such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Clostridium tetani, etc., Bacteria whose virulence (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, etc.), and Certain viruses that cause infection through respiratory or intestinal tract. The humoral immunity also participates in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions and certain autoimmune diseases. Production of antibodies is the main feature of humoral immune responses. The production of antibodies follows a characteristic pattern as follows:1. Lag phase: This is the immediate phase following exposure to antigen. During this phase, no antibodies are detected in circulation.2. Log phase: This is the next phase characterized by a steady rise in antibody titers in the circulation.3. Plateau: This is a phase of equilibrium between antibody synthesis and catabolism.4. Phase of decline: This phase is characterized by an increase in the catabolism of antibodies compared to the production of antibodies, leading to a fall in antibody titer in the circula-tion. Humoral immune response is of two types: primary and secondary.Primary Response During the primary response, when an individual encounters an antigen for the first time, antibody response to that antigen is detectable in the serum after a longer lag period than occurs in the secondary response. The serum antibody concentration continues to rise for several weeks and then declines; it may drop to very low levels. During this primary response, a small clone of B cells and plasma cells specific for the antigen are formed. The lag period is typically of 7-10 days duration but can be longer, even for weeks, depending on the nature of the anti-gen. For example, the lag phase may be as long as 2-3 weeks with some antigens, such as diphtheria toxoid, while it may be a short as a few hours with pneumococcal polysaccharide. The lag period also depends on dose of the antigen and the route of administration whether oral or parenteral. IgM is the first antibody to be formed, followed by IgG, IgA, or both. IgM levels tend to decline sooner as compared to IgG levels (Fig. 17-1). Secondary Response The antibody response is typically more rapid in the second-ary response, due to second encounter with the same antigen, or a closely related \"cross-reacting\" antigen, months or years after the primary response. The lag period is typically very short (only 3-5 days). The level of antibody is also much higher than that during the primary response. These changes in secondary response are attributed to the persistence of antigen-specific \"memory cells\" following the first contact with the antigen. These memory cells proliferate in large numbers to produce large clones of specific B cells and plasma cells that mediate the secondary response. In the secondary response: The amount of IgM produced is qualitatively similar to that produced after the first contact with the antigen; however, much more IgG is produced and the level of IgG tends to persist much longer than in the primary response. Furthermore, such antibody tends to bind antigen more firmly (i.e., to have higher affinity) and thus to dissociate less easily. Improved antibody binding is due to mutations that occur in the DNA that encodes the antigen-binding site. This process is called somatic hypermutation. Fate of Antigen in Tissues Route of administration of antigen affects the site of localiza-tion of these antigens in the body. For example, most of the Chap-17.indd 134 5/14/2012 11:55:36 AMSection II Chapter 17IMMUNE RESPONSE 135 antigens introduced subcutaneously are localized mainly in the draining lymph nodes and only a small amount is there in the spleen. On the other hand, most of the antigens introduced intravenously are localized in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, kidney, and lungs but not in lymph nodes. Approximately, three-fourths of these antigens are broken down by reticuloepi-thelial cells and are excreted out in the urine. Production of Antibodies Synthesis and production of antibodies typically is dependent on complex interaction of three cells: (a ) macrophages, (b ) helper T cells, and (c) B cells. Antigens are presented to immunocompetent cells by anti- gen presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Processing by macrophages appears to be a prerequisite for formation of antibodies against many T-cell-dependent antigens, such as proteins and erythrocytes. However, antibody production does not require macrophage participation in case of T-cell-independent antigens. Both the macrophages and dendritic cells present the antigen either native or processed at the cell surface. Macrophages play a key role by modulating the optimum dose of antigen presented to lymphocytes to induce the immune responses. After processing of antigens by a macrophage, fragments of antigen appear on surfaces of macrophages in association with class II MHC proteins. The antigen-class II MHC protein com-plex binds to specific receptors present on the surface of helper T cells. Subsequently, these helper T cells produce cytokines that activate B cells, producing antibodies that are specific for that antigen. The activated cytokines are interleukin-2 (T-cell growth factor), interleukin-4 (B-cell growth factor), and inter-leukin-5 (B-cell differentiation factor). The activated B cells undergo clonal proliferation and differentiate to form plasma cells, which then produce specific immunoglobulins (antibod-ies). Major host defense functions of antibodies include neu-tralization of toxins and viruses and opsonization (coating) of the pathogen, which aids its uptake by phagocytic cells.Although helper T cells play a key role in the formation of antibodies, certain substances (e.g., polysaccharides) can acti-vate B cells directly without the help of T cells. Such substances are called T-cell-independent antigens. These antigens, how-ever, induce only the production of IgM antibodies but not other antibodies by B cells. This is because B cells require inter-leukins 4 and 5 to switch classes to produce IgG, IgA, and IgE. These interleukins 4 and 5 are produced by T helper cells only. B cells perform two important functions: First, they recognize antigens with their surface IgM that acts as an antigen recep-tor; second, they present epitopes to helper T cells in associa-tion with class II MHC proteins. IgM antigen receptor on the B cells recognizes foreign proteins as well as lipids, carbohydrates, DNA, RNA, etc. On the other hand, class II MHC proteins pres-ent protein fragments to the helper T cells. The IgM antigen receptor binds with this wide variety of molecules that stimulate B cells to produce antibodies against all the molecules possible. Theories of antibody formation There are two sets of theories of antibody formation. These are instructive theory and selective theories. Instructive theory Instructive theory suggests that an immunocompetent cell is capable of synthesizing antibodies of all specificity. The antigen directs the immunocompetent cell to produce complementary antibodies. Two instructive theories are postulated as follows:Direct template theory: This theory was first postulated by Breinl and Haurowitz (1930). They suggested that a particu-lar antigen or antigenic determinants would serve as a template against which antibodies would fold. The antibody molecule would thereby assume a configuration complementary to antigen template.Indirect template theory: This theory was first postulated by Burnet and Fenner (1949). They suggested that the entry of anti-genic determinants into the antibody-producing cells induced a heritable change in these cells.

However, this theory that tried to explain specificity and secondary responses is no longer accepted. Selective theories Three selective theories were postulated as follows:Side chain theory: This theory was proposed by Ehrlich (1898). According to this theory, immunocompetent cells have surface receptors that are capable of reacting with antigens, which have complementary side chains. When antigens are introduced into host, they combine with those cell receptors that have a complementary fit. This inactivates the receptors. There is an overproduction of the same type of receptors that circulate as antibodies, as a compensatory mechanism.Natural selection theory: This theory was proposed by Jerne (1955). According to this theory, during the embryonic life, mil-lions of globulin molecules were formed against all possible range of antigens. The antigen when introduced to the host combines selectively with the globulin molecule that has the nearest comple-mentary fit. The globulin with the combined antigen stimulates antibody-forming cells to produce the same type of antibody.Clonal selection theory: Burnet (1957) suggested that immu-nological specificity existed in the cell but not in the serum and proposed the most acceptable clonal selection theory. According to this theory, a large number of clones of immunological com-petent cells bearing specific antibody patterns are produced during fetal development by a process of somatic mutations of immunological competent cells (ICCs) against all possible antigens. This theory suggests that an individual ICC expresses mem- brane receptors that are specific for a distinct antigen. This unique receptor specificity is determined before the lympho-cyte is exposed to antigen. Binding of antigen to its specific receptor activates the cell and leads to cellular proliferation to form clones, synthesizing the antibody. The clonal selection theory is most widely accepted and pro- vides a framework for better understanding of the specificity, immunological memory, and the property of recognition of self and nonself by adoptive immunity. Factors affecting production of antibodies Many factors affect the production of antibodies. These factors are discussed below: Genetic factors Genetic factors influence the response of the host to antigen. Persons responding to antigens are called responders, while persons not responding are called nonresponders. These dif-ferences are controlled genetically and are being controlled by immune response (Ir) gene located in the short arm of the 6th chromosome. Age The embryo and the infant, at birth, are not fully immunologi-cally competent. Full competence is achieved by about the age of 5-7 years for IgG and 10-15 years for IgA by the development of lymphoid organs. Nutritional status Malnutrition affects both the humoral and cell-mediated immunities. Deficiencies of amino acid and vitamins have shown to decrease the production of antibodies. Route of antigen Induction of immune response in a host depends on the route of administration of the antigen. Parenteral administration of the antigen induces a better immune response than the oral or nasal routes. Dose of antigen A minimum critical dose of antigen is essential to elicit an opti-mum immunological response. A very high or small dose fails to stimulate the immune system. This phenomenon is referred to as immunological paralysis. Multiple antigens Antibody responses vary when two or more antigens are admin-istered simultaneously. Antibody responses to one or more of them may be diminished due to antigenic competition, or enhanced as seen after vaccination with triple vaccine (diph-theria, pertussis, and tetanus), or may be similar. Hence, the nature and relative proportions of different antigens should be carefully adjusted for optimal effect. Adjuvants Adjuvants are the substances that enhance the immuno-genicity of an antigen. The adjuvants delay the release of an antigen from the site of injection and prolong the anti-genic stimulus. The substances that are used as adjuvants include: (a) Freund's incomplete adjuvant (protein antigen incorpo-rated in water phase of water in oil emulsion); (b) Freund's complete adjuvant (incomplete adjuvant along with suspension of killed tubercle bacilli); (c) Aluminum salts both phosphate and hydroxide; and (d) Others, such as silica particles, beryllium sulfate, endo-toxin, e tc. Key Points An adjuvant functions in the following ways: It causes sustained release of antigen from depot. It enhances immunogenicity of nonantigenic substances. It increases the concentration and persistence of antibodies. It induces and enhances CMI. It 137 Immunosuppressive agents Immunosuppressive agents are those that suppress immune response. They are used in transplantation surgery and in situ-ations that require suppression of host immunity. The agents are as follows:X-irradiation: Sublethal dose of irradiation is toxic to replicat- ing cells and is used to suppress antibody formation. Antibody production ceases after 24 hours of receiving irradiation.Radiometric drugs: These include alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide, nitrogen mustard, etc.), which suppress antibody production. Cyclophosphamide, given for 3 days, completely suppresses the antibody response. It selectively prevents replication of B cells.Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs that diminish the responsiveness of both B and T cells. They alter maturation of activated cells by suppressing the production of interleukins. They suppress delayed hypersensitivity, but in therapeutic doses for a short period, they have little effect on the production of antibodies.Antimetabolites: These include folic acid antagonists (such as methotrexate); (5-fluorouracil). These substances inhibit DNA and RNA syn-thesis, thereby inhibiting the cell division and differentiation, which is essential for cellular and humoral immune responses. These are usually used for prevention of graft rejection.Antilymphocyte serum: Antilymphocyte serum (ALS) is a heterogeneous antiserum raised against T lymphocytes. The ALS acts mainly against circulating lymphocytes but not against lymphocytes in lymphoid organs. It is mainly used to prevent graft rejection in transplantation surgery. Monoclonal Antibodies Antibodies that arise from a single clone of cells (e.g., myeloma) are homogenous and are called monoclonal antibodies. For example, in multiple myeloma, antibodies are produced by a single clone of plasma cells against a single antigenic determi-nant, and hence antibodies are monoclonal. The monoclonal antibodies differ from polyclonal antibodies, which are heter-ologous and are formed by several different clones of plasma cells in response to antigen. Method of production of monoclonal antibodies Kohler and Milstein (1975) were the first to describe a method for production of monoclonal antibodies against a desired antigen for which they were awarded Nobel Prize in 1984. Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusion of myeloma cells with antibody-producing cells, resulting in production of hybridomas. Such hybridomas produce virtually unlimited quantities of antibodies that are useful in research and diag-nostics. In this procedure, mouse splenic lymphocytes are first fused with mouse myeloma cells to produce hybrid cells or hybridomas. Myeloma cell provides the hybrid cell immortality, whereas splenic plasma cell provides the antibody- producing capacity. These hybridomas can be maintained indefinitely in culture and continue to produce monoclonal antibodies. Hybridoma cells are prepared in following ways (Fig. 17-2): First, an animal (e.g., mouse) is immunized with the antigen of interest. Spleen cells (lymphocytes) are then fused with mouse myeloma cells and grown in culture, which are deficient in the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). Fusion of the cells is facilitated by addition of certain chemi-cals, such as polyethylene glycol. The fused cells are grown in a special culture medium (HAT medium) that supports the growth of the fused hybrid cells but not of the parent cells. Finally, the resulting clones of cells are screened for the production of antibody to the antigen of interest. These clones are then selected for continuous cultivation. The hybridomas can be maintained indefinitely and will continue to produce monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies, such as chimeric antibodies, have been produced with modification of the original tech-nique for therapeutic use, since mouse monoclonal antibod-ies are not suitable. The chimeric antibodies consisting of human constant regions and mouse variable regions are being prepared for use in treatment of leukemia. Chimeric antibodies are also used to kill tumor cells either by delivering toxins, such as diphtheria to tumor cells, or by killing tumor cells through complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Key Points Monoclonal antibodies are now used widely in research and diagnostics. They are used in various clinical situations, such as treat-ment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. They are used in inducing immune suppression in trans-plant surgery, and in the prevention of infectious diseases. Function of Antibodies Antibodies are the primary defense against infectious patho gens or their products. Antibodies can be induced in the host actively by use of vaccines or acquired passively for conferring imme-diate protection against the pathogen. For example, hyperim-munized sera containing readymade antitoxins against toxins of tetanus, botulism, or diphtheria are given to neutralize the actions of these toxins immediately in the body. Also, hyperim-mune sera containing high titer of specific antibodies are given to inhibit attachment and replication of rabies and hepatitis A and B viruses early during the period of incubation. The func-tions of the antibodies can be summarized as follows:Neutralization: By binding to the pathogen or foreign sub-stance, antibodies can block the binding of the pathogen with their targets. For example, antibodies to bacterial toxins can prevent the binding of the toxin to host cells, thereby ren-dering the toxin ineffective. Similarly, antibody binding to a Chap-17.indd 137 5/14/2012 11:55:38 AMSection II Chapter 17138 IMMUNOLOGY virus or bacterial pathogen can block the attachment of the pathogen to its target cell, thereby preventing infection or colonization.Opsonization: Antibody binding to a pathogen or foreign substance can opsonize the material and facilitate its uptake and destruction by phagocytic cells. The Fc region of other antibody interacts with Fc receptors on phagocytic cells, rendering the pathogen more readily phagocytosed.Complement activation: Activation of the complement cascade by antibody can result in lysis of certain bacteria and viruses. In addition, some components of the complement cascade (e.g., C3b) opsonize pathogens and facilitate their uptake via complement receptors on phagocytic cells. Tests for Detection of Humoral Immunity The measurement of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the patient's serum is the primary method for detection of humoral immu-nity. Radial immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis are the methods frequently employed for measurement of antibodies.Cell-Mediated Immunity Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is a specific type of acquired immune response not mediated by antibodies but by sensitized T cells. This form of immunity is transferred from donor to recipient, not with antisera but with intact lymphocytes; hence it is called cell-mediated immune reaction. CMI performs the following immunological functions: 1. It confers immunity in diseases caused 2. It participates in immunological surveillance and immu-nity against cancer. 3. It plays an important role in pathogenesis of delayed hypersensitivity reactions and in pathogenesis of cer tain autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroiditis, encephalitis, etc. Mouse injected with specific antigen to raise antibodyCultured myeloma cells (Cancerous B cells) Suspension of myeloma cells Unfused myeloma cellsUnfused spleen cellsFused hybrid cells Suspension of spleen cellsSpleen Mixture of cells placed in selective medium that allows only fused hybrid cells to grow The hybrid cells proliferate into clones called hybridomas followed by screening of hybridomas for desired antibodies The selected hybridomas are then cultured to produce desired monoclonal antibodies on large scaleHybridomas Monoclonal antibodies of interest FIG. 17-2. A schematic diagram showing the production of monoclonal antibodies. Chap-17.indd 138 5/14/2012 11:55:38 AMSection II Chapter 17IMMUNE RESPONSE 139 Induction of CMI Antigen processing and presentation are the means by which antigens become associated with self-MHC molecules for pre-sentation to T cells with appropriate receptors. Proteins from exogenous antigens, such as bacteria, are internalized via endo-cytic vesicles into APCs, such as macrophages. Then, they are exposed to cellular proteases in intracellular vesicles. Peptides, approximately 10-30 amino acid residues length, are gen-erated in endosomal vesicles. The endosomal vesicles can class II MHC mol-ecules. Induction of CMI involves sequence of events, which is explained below. Presentation of foreign antigen by APCs to T lymphocytes Induction of CMI begins with presentation of foreign antigen by APCs to T lymphocytes. T-cell receptors (TCRs), which are antigen recognition receptors, are present on T lymphocytes, and recognize foreign antigen and a self-MHC molecule on the surface of APCs. Subsequently, the sensitized T lymphocytes undergo blast transformation, clonal proliferation, and dif-ferentiation into memory cells and effector cells, such as Th, Tc, Td, and Ts. Finally, the lymphokines, which are biologically active products responsible for various manifestations of CMI, are released by the activated lymphocytes. Recognition of antigen by T cells T cells recognize antigens only when presented with MHC mol-ecules. The combination of foreign antigen and class I MHC molecule is recognized by CD8/H11001 cells. These CD8/H11001 cells after recognition differentiate into Tc and Ts lymphocytes. On the other hand, CD4/H11001 cells recognize the combination of antigen and class II MHC antigen, after which they are differentiated into Th and Td cells. The class II MHC molecules are synthe-sized, as for other membrane glycoprotein, in the rough endo-plasmic reticulum and then proceed out through the Golgi apparatus. A third polypeptide, the invariant chain (Ii), protects the binding site of the class II dimer until the lowered pH of the compartment created after fusion with an endosomal vesicle causes a dissociation of the Ii chain. The MHC class II peptide antigen complex is then transported to the cell surface for display and recognition by a TCR of a CD4 T cell. The lymphocyte recognizes antigen and class I MHC mol- ecule and gets attached to the target cells. Endogenous anti-gens such as cytosolic viral proteins synthesized in an infected cell are processed for presentation by class I MHC molecule. In brief, cytosolic proteins are broken down by a peptidase complex known as the proteasome. The cytosolic peptides gain access to nascent MHC class I molecules in the rough endo-plasmic reticulum via peptide transporter systems (transport-ers associated with antigen processing; TAPs). The TAP genes are also encoded in the MHC. The binding groove of the class I molecule is more constrained than that of the class II molecule; for that reason, shorter peptides are found in class I than in class II MHC molecules. Release of cytokines by Tc lymphocytes This lymphocytes to release cytokines, resulting in the lysis of the target cells. The T cells then detach from the target cells and attach with other target cells, and the same pro-cess is repeated. Interferon-gamma synthesized and secreted by Tc lymphocytes possibly also contributes macrophage acti-vation some Cytokines are biologically active substances secreted by mono-cytes, lymphocytes, and other cells and are actively involved in innate immunity, adoptive immunity, and inflammation. They actively take part in a wide range of biological activities varying from chemotaxis to activation of specific cells. Cytokines were initially identified as products of immune cells that act as mediators and regulators of immune processes. Many cytokines are now known to be produced by cells other than immune cells, and they can have effects on nonimmune cells as well. Cytokines are currently being used clinically as bio-logical response modifiers for the treatment of various disorders. Cytokines are not typically stored as preformed proteins. Rather their synthesis is initiated by gene transcription and their mRNAs are short-lived. They are produced as needed in immune responses. Many individual cytokines are produced by many cell types and act on many cell types (i.e., they are pleiotropic), and in many cases cytokines have similar actions (i.e., they are redun-dant). Redundancy is due to the nature of the cytokine receptors. Categories of cytokines Cytokines can be grouped into different categories based on their functions or their source, but it is noteworthy that because they can be produced by many different cells and act on many dif-ferent cells (Table 17-1), any attempt to categorize them will be subject to limitations. Cytokines may be categorized as follows: 1. Mediators affecting lymphocytes. leukocytes. Mediators affecting stem cells. 5. Mediators produced by macrophages that affect other cells. Mediators affecting lymphocytes Interleukin-1 (IL-1): It is a protein produced mainly by activated macrophages and monocytes. Its production is stimulated by antigens, toxins, and inflammatory processes but inhibited by cyclosporine and corticosteroids. It is an important interleukin, which mediates a wide range of metabolic, physiological, inflammatory, and hematological activities. It has many important functions, which are given below: It activates a wide range of target cells including T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts to proliferate, differentiate, or synthesize specific products. For example, it stimulates helper T cells to produce IL-2, and stimulates B cells to proliferate and synthesize antibodies, etc. It acts on the hypothalamus to cause fever associated with infections and other inflammatory reactions. Chap-17.indd 139 5/14/2012 11:55:38 AMSection II Chapter 17140 IMMUNOLOGY Interleukin-2 (IL-2): IL-2 is a protein produced mainly by helper T cells. It is a major T-cell growth factor. It stimulates both helper and cytotoxic T cells to grow. It also promotes the growth of B cells and can activate natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes. IL-2 acts on T cells in an autocrine fashion. Activation of T cells results in expression of IL-2R and the production of IL-2. The IL-2 binds to the IL-R and promotes cell division. When the T cells are no longer being stimulated by antigen, the IL-2R will eventually decay and the proliferative phase ends.Interleukin-4 (IL-4): It is a protein produced mainly by helper T cells and macrophages. It stimulates the development of Th-2 cells, the subset of helper T cells that produces IL-4 and IL-5 and enhances humoral immunity by producing antibodies. It is also required for class (isotype) switching from one class of antibodies to another within antibody-producing cells.Interleukin-5 (IL-5): It is a protein produced by helper T cells. It promotes the growth and differentiation of B cells and eosinophils. It enhances the synthesis of IgA and also stimulates the production and activation of eosinophils.Interleukin-6 (IL-6): It is a protein produced by helper T cells and macrophages. It stimulates the production of acute phase proteins by the liver. It also acts on the hypothalamus to cause fever.Other interleukins: IL-10, IL-12, other lymphocytes. IL-10 is produced by activated macrophages and Th-2 cells. It is predominantly an inhibitory cytokine. It inhibits production of type I interferon. It inhibits production of interferon-gamma by Th-1 cells, which shifts immune responses toward a Th-2 type. It also inhibits cytokine production by activated macrophages and the expression of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules on macrophages, resulting in a depression of immune responses. IL-12 is produced by activated macrophages and dendritic cells. It stimulates the production of interferon-gamma and induces the differentiation of Th cells to become Th-1 cells. In addition, it enhances the cytolytic functions of Tc and NK cells. IL-13 is produced by Th-2 cells. It is associated with patho- genesis of allergic airway disease (asthma). It is involved in the occurrence of hyper-responsiveness seen in asthma.Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-/H9252 ): It is produced by T cells and many other cell types. It is primarily an inhibitory cytokine. It inhibits the proliferation of T cells and the activation of macrophages. It also acts on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells to block the effects of proinflammatory cytokines. In essence, it suppresses the immune response when it is not required after an infection, and thereby it promotes the healing process. Mediators affecting macrophages and monocytes Chemokines are a subtype of cytokines of low molecular weight and with a characteristic structural pattern. More than 50 che-mokines varying in size from 68 to 120 amino acids have been identified. The alpha-chemokines, such as IL-8 are produced by activated mononuclear cells, which attract neutrophils. The beta-chemokines, such as RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and MCAF (monocyte chemotactic and activating factor), are produced by activated T cells and attract macrophages and monocytes. Chemokines are produced by endothelial cells, resi- dent macrophages and various cells present at the site of infection: They attract either macrophages or neutrophils to the site of infection, hence are involved in chemical-induced migration of leukocytes\u2014a process called chemotaxis. Specific recep-tors for chemokines are present on the surface of monocytes and neutrophils. They also facilitate migration of white cells into the tissue to reach the infected area. They do so by activating integrins Cytokine Source Functions IL-1 Macrophages Activates helper fever IL-2 Th-1 cells Activates helper, cytotoxic T cells and B cells IL-3 Th cells, NK, and mast cells Supports growth and differentiation, stimulates histamine release IL-4 Th-2 cells Stimulates B-cell growth, increases and expression IL-5 viral replication Interferon-/H9253 Th-1, Tc, and NK cells Inhibits viral replication, increases expression of class I and II MHC, stimulates phagocytosis and killing by macrophages and NK cells necrosis factor Macrophages Activates neutrophils and increases their adhesion to endothelial cells, mediates septic shock, causes necrosis of tumors, lipolysis, wasting, antiviral and antiparasitic effects Transforming growth factor-/H9252Platelets, mast cells, and lymphocytesInduces increased IL-1 production, induces class switch to IgA, limits inflammatory response, and promotes wound healingTABLE 17-1 Important functions of the main cytokines Chap-17.indd 140 5/14/2012 11:55:38 AMSection II Chapter 17IMMUNE RESPONSE 141 on the surface of neutrophils and macrophages that bind to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) proteins on the surface of the endothelium. Mediators affecting polymorphonuclear leukocytes Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-/H9251): It is produced by activated macrophages in response to microbes, especially the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. It is an important mediator of acute inflammation. It mediates the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to sites of infection by stimulating endothelial cells to produce adhesion molecules. It also produces chemokines, which are chemotactic cytokines. TNF-/H9251 also acts on the hypothalamus to produce fever, and it promotes the production of acute phase proteins.Chemokines and other chemotactic factors: Chemokines and other chemotactic factors attract selectively neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils to the site of infection. For example, IL-8 and C5a component of the complement attract specifically neutrophils.Leukocyte-inhibiting factor: It inhibits migration of neutro-phils, thereby retaining the cells at the site of infection. Mediators affecting stem cells Mediators affecting stem cells include (a) IL-3, (b) granulo-cyte IL-3 produced by helper T cells suppresses the growth and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. GM-CSF produced by macrophages and T lymphocytes stimulates the growth granulocytes. G-CSF is produced by macrophages, fibroblasts, and endo-thelial cells. It facilitates development of neutrophils from stem cells, and hence used to prevent infection in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Mediators produced by macrophages that affect other cells Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-/H9251): TNF-/H9251, as the name suggests, causes death and necrosis of certain tumor cells in experimental animals. It is also called cachectin because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissues, thereby reducing the utilization of fatty acids, leading to cachexia. TNF-/H9251 performs many functions: It activates respiratory burst within neutrophils, thereby enhancing killing activities of phagocytes. It facilitates adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells of blood vessels. It also stimulates growth of B cells and increases synthesis of lymphokines by helper T cells. Macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF): It is produced by macrophages in response to action by endotoxin. It retains the macrophages at the site of infection. It plays an important role in the induction of septic shock.Nitric oxide (NO): It is produced by macrophages in response to action by endotoxin. NO causes vasodilatation, thereby inducing hypotension in septic shock. Tests for Detection of CMI The CMI can be detected by in vivo and in vitro tests as follows: CMI in vivo tests Skin tests are useful to detect delayed hypersensitivity reac-tion to common antigens that come in contact with the body. Purified protein derivative in tuberculin test, dinitrochloro-benzene, or dinitrofluorobenzene are the antigens used for the skin testing. Most of the normal people respond with delayed type reac- tions to these skin antigens. Absence of reactions to these skin tests suggests impairment of the CMI. CMI in vitro tests Many in vitro tests are available for detection of CMI. These are: 1. Migration inhibition factor (MIF) test: This test is performed to determine the CMI by making a semiquantita-tive assessment of the migration inhibition of leukocytes. This test depends on the principle that cultured T cells pro-duce macrophage migration inhibition factor on exposure to the antigen to which they are sensitized. In this test, human peripheral leukocytes are incubated in capillary tubes in cul-ture chamber containing culture fluid. The leukocytes, in the absence of antigen, migrate out to the open end of the tube to form a fan-like pattern. In the presence of antigen, the leuko-cytes are prevented from migrating.2. Lymphocyte blast transformation: A large number of T cells undergo blast transformation when exposed to certain mitogens, such as the phytohemagglutinin and concavalin. Sensitized T lymphocytes are transformed into large blast cells with great increase in the synthesis of DNA, on exposure to the specific antigen. An increase in DNA synthesis is then measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine.3. Enumeration of T cells, B cells, and subpopulation: Fluorescence-activated cell sorter is used to count the number of each type of cells, whether T or B cells. In this method, cells are labeled with monoclonal antibody tagged with a fluores-cent dye, such as fluorescent or rhodamine. The number of cells that fluoresce is registered by passing those single cells through a laser light beam. The total number of B cells can be counted by using fluorescein-labeled antibodies against all immunoglobulin classes. Specific monoclonal antibodies directed against T-cell marker allows the counting of T cells, CD4 helper cells, CD8 suppressor cells, and other cells. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 in normal person is 1.5 or more but becomes less than one in persons with AIDS.4. Rosette formation: Rosette is a lymphocyte to which three or more sheep erythrocytes are attached. Most T cells form rosettes when mixed with sheep erythrocytes. T-cell IMMUNOLOGY referred to as E-rosette. T cells can be determined by counting E-rosettes. Rosette formation is useful to detect T cells, hence the CMI of the host. Transfer Factor Lawrence in 1954 first reported transfer of CMI in humans by injection of an extract from the leukocytes from the immunized host. The extract from leukocytes contained soluble substance known as transfer factor (TF). The transferred immunity is specific in that CMI can be trans-ferred only to those antigens to which the donor is specific. Transferred immunity is systemic and not local. TF does not transfer humoral immunity. TF is a nucleopeptide with a low molecular weight of 2000-4000 Da. It is resistant to trypsin but gets inactivated by heat-ing at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. It is nonantigenic. The exact mode of action of TF is not known. It is believed to stimulate the release of lymphokines from sensitized T lymphocytes. Key Points TF has following clinical applications: It is used in treatment of disseminated infections associated with deficient CMI, such as tuberculosis and lepromatous leprosy. It is used in treatment of malignant melanoma and other types of cancer. It is used in treatment of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and other T-cell-deficient syndromes. Immunological Tolerance Immunological tolerance is a state of specific immunologic unresponsiveness to a particular antigen to which a person has been exposed earlier. The immune tolerance prevents the body to mount immune response against the self-antigen. Mechanisms of Tolerance Suggested mechanism of tolerance includes ( a) clonal deletion, (b) clonal anergy, and ( c) suppression. 1. Clonal deletion: Clones of B and T lymphocytes that recognize self-antigens are selectively deleted in embryonic life, hence are not available to respond on subsequent exposure to antigen. This is known as clonal deletion.2. Clonal anergy: Clonal anergy means a condition in which clones of B and T lymphocytes that recognize self-antigens might be present but cannot be activated.3. Suppression: In this mechanism, clones of B and T lym- phocytes expressing receptors that recognize self-antigens are preserved. However, expression of immune responses following antigen recognition might be inhibited by active suppression. Types of Immune Tolerance The immune tolerance may be of two types: natural or acquired.Natural tolerance: Natural tolerance is nonresponsiveness to self-antigens. It develops during the embryonic life, and any antigen that comes in contact with the immune system during its embryonic life is recognized as self-antigen. The self-antigen would not induce any immune response. Burnet and Fenner (1949) also postulated that foreign antigens would not induce immune response if they were administered during the embryonic life.Acquired tolerance: Acquired tolerance develops when a potential immunogen induces a state of unresponsiveness to itself. The antigen needs to be repeatedly or persistently admin-istered to maintain the acquired tolerance. This is probably necessary because of the continuous production of new B and T cells that must be rendered tolerant. Induction of immune tolerance depends on a number of factors. These include (a) species and immune competence of the host and (b) physical nature, dose, and route of administration of antigens. Species and immune competence of the host: Tolerance depends on the immunological maturity of the host. Embryos and neonatal animals are immunologically immature, hence are more susceptible for induction of tolerance. Rabbits and mice can be made tolerant more rapidly than guinea pigs and chickens. Physical nature, dose, and route of administration of antigens: Soluble antigens and haptens can induce more immune tolerance than the aggregated antigens. For example, heat aggregated human gamma globulin is more tolerogenic than deaggregated gamma globulin in mice. It may possi-bly be due to enhanced phagocytosis of aggregated proteins than soluble antigens by macrophages, in which they can be presented to antibody-forming cells, thus inducing antibody synthesis. The induction of tolerance is dose dependent also. For example, a very simple molecule induces tolerance more readily than a complex one. Repeated minute doses as well as high doses of antigen induce B-cell tolerance, whereas a moderate degree of same antigen may be immunogenic. The route of administration is also important. In guinea pigs, intravenous or oral administration of certain hap-tens causes tolerance, whereas intradermal administration causes induction of immunity. T cells become tolerant more readily than B cells and also remain tolerant longer than B cells. Tolerance is overcome spontaneously or by injection of cross-reacting antigens. For example, in rabbits, tolerance to bovine serum albumin can be abolished by immunization with cross-reacting human serum albumin. Tolerance can be enhanced by administration of immunosuppressive drugs. For example, tolerance is enhanced in patients who have received organ transplants.

Immunodeficiency diseases and syndromes are the causes of significant mortality and morbidity, as well as a source of extremely valuable information about the physiology of the human immune system. Immunodeficiency can occur in T cells, B cells, comple- ment, and phagocytes\u2014the major components of the immune system. A functional defect of the immune system is suspected when a patient: Has unusual frequency of infections with common or opportunistic microorganisms; Has unusually severe infections; and Is unable to eradicate infections with antibiotics to which the microorganisms are sensitive. Recurrent infections with certain viruses, protozoa, and fungi indicate a T-cell deficiency, whereas recurrent infections with pyogenic bacteria (such as staphylococci) indicate a B-cell deficiency. Immunodeficiency disorders can be classified as (a) primary immunodeficiencies or (b) secondary immunodeficiencies. Primary Immunodeficiencies A condition resulting from a genetic or developmental defect in the immune system is called a primary immunodeficiency. In such a condition, the defect is present at birth, although it may not manifest itself until later in life. Most of the primary immu-nodeficiencies are inherited from parents to offsprings. Primary immunodeficiency may affect either adaptive or innate immune functions. Most defects that lead to immunodeficiencies affect either myeloid or lymphoid cell lineages. The lymphoid cell disorders may affect T cells, B cells, or both B and T cells, whereas the myeloid cell disorders may affect phagocytic function. Primary immunodeficiency diseases can be classified as: (a) immunodeficiencies, immunodeficiencies, and deficiencies X-linked hypogammaglobu-linemia, selective immunoglobulin deficiencies, (c) hyper-IgM receptor pro-totype of \"pure\" B-cell deficiency. In the majority of cases, the disease is transmitted as a sex-linked trait. The defective gene is located on Xq21.2-22, the locus coding important role in B-cell differentiation and maturation, and is also part of the group of tyrosine kinases involved in B-cell signaling in adult life. Most cases of infantile agammaglobu-linemia are associated with mutations affecting Btk. X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia shows the follow ing features: It is characterized by extremely low IgG levels and by the absence of other immunoglobulin classes. Individuals with XLA have no peripheral B cells and suf-fer from recurrent bacterial infections, beginning at about 9 months of age. Patients suffer from repeated infections caused by common pyogenic organisms ( Streptococcus and septicemia. Chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchiec-tasis develop as a consequence of repeated bronchopulmo-nary infections. Infections with Giardia lamblia are diagnosed with increased frequency in these patients and may lead to chronic diarrhea and malabsorption. Agammaglobulinemic patients are at risk of developing para-lytic polio after vaccination with the attenuated virus; they also are at risk of developing chronic viral meningoencephali-tis, usually caused by an echovirus. Arthritis of the large joints develops in about 30-35% of the cases and is believed to be infectious, caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. This condition is best treated with replacement therapy using gamma globulin (a plasma fraction containing predominantly IgG, obtained from normal healthy donors) administered intravenously. Selective immunoglobulin deficiencies In this condition, only one or more of the immunoglobulins are deficient in serum, while the others remain normal or ele-vated. IgA deficiency is the most common example of selective immunoglobulin deficiencies. IgA deficiency is characterized by nearly absent serum and secretory IgA. The IgA level is less than 5 ng/dL, but the remaining immunoglobulin class levels are normal or elevated. The disorder is either familial or it may Immunodeficiency Chap-18.indd 143 5/14/2012 11:55:12 AMSection Chapter 18144 IMMUNOLOGY be acquired in association with measles or other types of viral infection, or toxoplasmosis. The etiology of IgA deficiency is unknown, but is believed to be due to arrested B-cell development. The principal defect appears to be in IgA B-cell differentiation. The adult patients with selective IgA deficiency usually express the immature phe-notype, only a few of which can transform into IgA-synthesizing plasma cells. Although IgA cells are produced, these cells fail to secrete IgA. IgA is the principal immunoglobulin in secretions and is an important part of the defense of mucosal surfaces. Thus, IgA-deficient individuals have an increased incidence of respi-ratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital infections. They also have an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthri-tis. There is an increased incidence of the disorder in certain atopic individuals. Some selective IgA-deficiency patients form significant titers of antibody against IgA. They may develop anaphylactic reactions upon receiving IgA-containing blood transfusions. Selective IgA deficiency is diagnosed by the demonstration of less than 5 mg/dL of IgA in serum. They, however, have normal levels of IgG and IgM antibodies. Some individuals develop antibodies against IgG, IgM, and IgA. Hyper-IgM syndrome This condition is characterized by high concentration of serum IgM but very low concentration of serum IgG, IgA, and IgE. They have normal numbers of T cells and B cells. Some of these immunodeficiencies are X-linked and some are inherited as autosomal recessives. Patients with this condition are suscep-tible to recurrent microbial infections and many autoimmune disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hemo-lytic anemia. Interleukin-12 receptor deficiency Patients with interleukin-12 receptor deficiency are highly susceptible to disseminated mycobacterial infections. Lack of interleukin-12 receptor prevents IL-12 initiating a Th-1 response, which is essential to prevent mycobacterial infections. T-Cell Immunodeficiencies T-cell deficiencies include (a) b) chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, (c) transient hypogammaglobu-linemia of infancy, and (d) common, variable, unclassified immunodeficiency. Thymic aplasia (DiGeorge syndrome) The DiGeorge syndrome or thymic aplasia is a classic example of a pure T-cell deficiency. Although the DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital immunodeficiency, it is not hereditarily transmitted. The condition is believed to be caused by an intrauterine infection prior to the eighth week of life, possibly of viral etiol-ogy. It is associated with microdeletions of chromosomal region 22q11. From the immunological point of view, it results due to defective embryogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal clefts at 6-8 weeks of fetal life, leading to deficient development of the thymus and parathyroids. Tetany and hypocalcemia, both characteristics of hypopara- thyroidism, are observed in DiGeorge syndrome in addition to the defects in T-cell immunity. Peripheral lymphoid tissues exhibit a deficiency of lymphocytes in thymic-dependent areas. A defect in delayed-type hypersensitivity is demonstrated by the failure of affected patients to develop positive skin tests to commonly employed antigens, such as candidin or streptoki-nase and the inability to develop an allograft response. There is also minimal or absent in vitro responsiveness to T-cell antigens or mitogens. Defective cell-mediated immunity may increase susceptibility of the patient to opportunistic infections and render the individual vulnerable to a graft-versus-host reaction in blood transfusion recipients. However, the B or bursa equivalent-dependent areas, such as lymphoid follicles, show normal numbers of B cells and plasma cells in patients with DiGeorge syndrome. Serum immuno-globulin levels are within normal limits, and there is a normal immune response following immunization with commonly employed immunogens. Considerable success in treatment of DiGeorge syndrome has been achieved with fetal thymic trans-plants and by the passive administration of thymic humoral factors. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis Some patients with chronic infection of skin and mucosa with Candida albicans have exhibited a selective deficiency of cell-mediated immunity. Affected individuals develop severe and widespread forms of candidal infections. Skin tests with Candida antigens and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses to C. albicans reveal a selective lack of reactivity. T-lymphocyte functions are normal when tested with other antigens and mitogens. The humoral response to C. albicans is also normal. Symptomatic therapy with antimycotic agents is often unsuccessful. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy This condition is characterized by the hypogammaglobu-linemia in infants that occurs due to progressive catabolism of maternal IgG during the second and third months of life. This condition may persist until 2-3 years of age and become progressively more accentuated. In most cases, a deficiency of helper T-cell function appears to be responsible for the delay in immunoglobulin synthesis. The diagnostic hallmark for this disease is low-for-age circu- lating immunoglobulin levels. Peripheral blood B lymphocytes are usually normal. Intravenous gamma globulin is indicated until the child's immunoglobulin levels normalize. With time, most children develop normal immune function. Common, variable, unclassified immunodeficiency This condition, also known as late onset hypogammaglobu-linemia, includes a large number of cases of primary immuno-deficiency with heterogeneous presentations. These conditions Chap-18.indd 144 5/14/2012 11:55:13 AMSection II Chapter 18IMMUNODEFICIENCY 145 show a variable age of onset and patterns of inheritance, whose clinical picture is similar to that of XLA, but with a less severe course of clinical manifestations. T-cell function appears to be deficient in most cases, with abnormally low proliferative responses to T-cell mitogens. Sinusitis and bacterial pneumonia are the predomi- nant infections in patients with common, variable, unclas-sified immunodeficiency. Intestinal giardiasis is common. Opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci, mycobacteria, viruses, and other fungi are also more frequent in these patients. Treatment usually involves administration of intravenous gamma globulin. Combined B-Cell and T-Cell Deficiencies Combined B-cell and T-cell deficiencies include (a) severe combined immunodeficiency, (b) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, (c) ataxia telangiectasia, and (d) MHC class II deficiency. Severe combined immunodeficiency Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) includes many syndromes with severe deficiency of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. All these are inherited diseases with a defect in the differentiation of early stem cells. These are of two types: X-linked and autosomal.X-linked SCID: The sex-linked SCID is associated with a defect of the gene that codes for a polypeptide chain common to several interleukin receptors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-11, and IL-15). This chain is involved in signaling of second messages, thus in its absence, T-cell precursors fail to receive the signals necessary for their proliferation and differentiation. There is T- and B-cell lymphopenia and decreased production of IL-2. There is an absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity, cellular immunity, and of normal antibody synthesis following immu-nogenic challenge.Autosomal SCID: This is due to a mutation in the gene encoding a tyrosine kinase called ZAP-70, which plays an important role in signal transduction in T cells. Other SCID patients show mutations in other genes, such as RAG-1 or RAG-2, that are essential to produce T-cell antigen receptor and the IgM monomer on the B cell that acts as antigen carrier. SCID is a disease of infancy, presenting with failure to thrive. Affected individuals frequently die during the first 2 years of life. Clinically, they may develop a measles-like rash, show hyperpigmentation, and develop severe recurrent (especially pulmonary) infections. These patients have heightened suscep-tibility to Pneumocystis carinii, C. albicans, and other pathogens. Even attenuated microorganisms, such as those used for immu-nization, e.g., attenuated poliomyelitis viruses, may induce infection in SCID patients. All these forms of SCID can be cor-rected with a bone marrow graft from HLA-DR matched sib-lings. The graft is usually successful, but there is a great risk for the development of graft-versus-host disease.Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): It is a problem in SCID patients receiving unirradiated blood transfusions. It can also develop after transfusion of any fresh blood component contaminated with viable T lymphocytes. It is characterized by fever, maculopapular rash involving the volar surfaces, diarrhea and protein-losing positive hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. In full-blown cases, the outcome is generally poor, with death occurring within 10-14 days from the onset of symptomatology. The reaction may be prevented in the case of transfusion by using frozen or irradiated blood products. Current attempts at eliminating all cells except stem cells from bone marrow grafts appear promising. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked recessive immuno-deficiency disease of infants. It is characterized by thrombo-cytopenia, eczema, and increased IgA and IgE levels. There is decreased cell-mediated immunity. The inability to mount an IgM response to capsular polysaccharide of bacteria is the most important defect. IgA and IgE are increased, but IgM is dimin-ished, although IgG serum concentrations are usually normal. By electron microscopy, T cells appear to lack the markedly fimbriated surface of normal T cells. T cells have abnormal sialophorin. The defect appears to be caused by the inability of T cells to provide help to B cells. Bone marrow transplantation corrects the deficiency. Ataxia telangiectasia It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes DNA repair enzyme. This condition is characterized by ataxia, telangiectasia, and recurrent infections in babies by 2 years of age. IgA deficiency and lymphopenia commonly occur. MHC class II deficiency It is an autosomal recessive disease failing to express MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells, such as macrophages and B cells. This results in a deficiency of CD4 T cells. The lack of these helper T cells results in production of deficient antibodies. Complement Deficiencies Complement deficiencies include the following conditions: Recurrent infections This is a condition caused by a deficiency of C1, C3, or C5, or even C6, C7, or C8 components of the complement. Patients with C3 deficiency are highly susceptible to infection with S. aureus and other pyogenic bacteria. Similarly, patients with C6, C7, or C8 deficiency are more susceptible to bacteremia with N. meningitidis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Autoimmune diseases Patients with deficiencies in C2 and C4 components have disease resembling systemic lupus erythematosus 145 5/14/2012 11:55:13 18146 IMMUNOLOGY autoimmune Patients with C2 deficiency are usually asymptomatic, and C2 deficiency is the most common comple-ment defect. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria It is a disease characterized by hemoglobinuria during night when patient is asleep. The hemoglobinuria occurs due to a complement-mediated hemolysis, especially at night. This is because the lower concentration of oxygen in the blood during sleep increases the susceptibility of the red blood cells to lysis. This occurs in the patients with a defect in the gene for the molecules that attach decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and other proteins to the cell membrane. This results in a deficiency of DAF on the surface of blood cell precursors, leading to an increased activation of complement and increased hemolysis. Hereditary angioedema Hereditary angioedema is a disease caused by a deficiency of C1 inhibitor, a component of the complement. This deficiency results in the continual action of C1 on C4 to produce more C4a and subsequently more C3a and C5a complement compo-nents. An increased production of the vasoactive components, such as C3a and C5a, results in the production of capillary permeability and edema in larynx and several other organs. Steroids (such as oxymetholone and danazol) are used to treat the condition, because they increase the concentration of C1 inhibitors, thereby preventing increased production of more C3a and C5a. Phagocyte Deficiencies Phagocyte deficiencies include (a) chronic granulomatous disease, (b) Chediak-Higashi syndrome, (c) Job's syndrome, (d) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a disorder that is inherited as an X-linked trait in two-thirds of the cases and as an autosomal recessive trait in the remaining one-third. Clinical manifestations are usually apparent before the end of the 2nd year of life. This is a condition associated with defi-ciency of an enzyme NADPH oxidase. This enzyme deficiency causes neutrophils and monocytes to have decreased consump-tion of oxygen and diminished glucose utilization by the hex-ose monophosphate shunt. Although neutrophils phagocytose microorganisms, they do not form superoxide and other oxy-gen intermediates that usually constitute the respiratory burst. All of these lead to decreased intracellular killing of bacteria and fungi. Thus, these individuals have an increased suscepti-bility to infection with microorganisms that normally are of relatively low virulence. These include Aspergillus , Serratia marc- escens, hepatosplenomegaly, pneu- monia, osteomyelitis, and draining lymph nodes. The quantitative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test and the quantitative killing curve are both employed to confirm the diagnosis of CGD. Therapy includes interferon gamma, antibiotics, and surgical drainage of abscesses. Chediak-Higashi syndrome It is a childhood disorder with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The condition is identified by the presence of large lysozomal granules in leukocytes that are very stable and undergo slow degranulation. The large cytoplasmic granular inclusions that appear in white blood cells may also be observed in blood platelets and can be seen by regular light microscopy in peripheral blood smears. The condition is characterized by a defective neutrophil chemotaxis and an altered ability of the cells to kill ingested microorganisms. The majority of affected individuals die during childhood, although occasional cases may live longer. There is no effective therapy other than the administration of antibiotics for treatment of the infecting microorganisms. High doses of ascorbic acid have been shown to restore normal chemotaxis, bactericidal activity, and degranulation. Job's syndrome Job's syndrome is caused by failure of helper T cells to produce gamma interferon, which in turn reduces the ability of mac-rophages to kill bacteria. This results in an increased produc-tion of Th-2 and consequently an increased production of IgE. All these in turn cause more production of histamine that prevents certain components of inflammatory reaction and also inhibits chemotaxis. Therefore, the patient with this syndrome suffers repeatedly from staphylococcal abscesses as well as eczema with a high level of IgE. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation in the gene encoding the B chain of an integrin that mediates adhesion of leukocytes to microbes. This adhe-sion of neutrophils to endothelial surfaces; hence phagocytosis of bacteria is inadequate. Cyclic neutropenia It is an autosomal dominant disease in which there is a mutation in the gene encoding neutrophil esterase, an enzyme produced by neutrophils. The disease is characterized by a very low neutrophil count, less than 200//H9262L for 3-6 days of a 21-day cycle. The patients are susceptible to life-threatening bacterial infections during these 3-6 days of low neutrophil count but not when neutrophil counts are normal. Myeloperoxidase deficiency It is a disease associated with deficiency of an enzyme myeloper-oxidase, which is essential for the production of hypochlorite, a microbicidal agent. The deficiency of this enzyme is fre-quently seen but has little clinical importance. This is because other intracellular killing mechanisms of leukocytes are intact. Chap-18.indd 146 5/14/2012 AMSection II Chapter 18IMMUNODEFICIENCY 147 Secondary Immunodeficiencies Secondary immunodeficiencies occur secondary to numerous diseases or conditions, or as a consequence of therapeutic mea-sures that depress the immune system. Most immunodeficient patients have secondary forms of immunodeficiency, caused by either pathological conditions that affect the immune system or the administration of therapeutic compounds with immunosuppres-sive effects. By far, the most common secondary immunodeficiency is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (or AIDS), which results from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Secondary immunodeficiencies are more common than primary immunodeficiencies and include AIDS, chemotherapy by immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), psychological depression, lymphoproliferative disease, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, sickle cell disease, malnutrition, aging, neoplasia, diabetes mellitus, and numerous other condi-tions. Secondary immunodeficiencies may be categorized as (a ) B-cell (b ) T-cell deficiencies as follows: B-Cell Deficiencies Common variable hypogammaglobulinemia This condition is caused due to a defective T-cell signaling resulting in failure to produce IgG in the body. This occurs in persons between the ages of 13 and 35 years. In this condi-tion, the number of B cells is normal, but the ability to pro-duce IgG and other immunoglobulins is greatly reduced. The cell-mediated immunity is normal. Patients with this condition are highly susceptible to infections caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and other pyogenic bacteria. Administration of intravenous gamma globulin reduces the infections caused by these bacteria. Malnutrition In malnutrition, the synthesis of IgG is reduced due to low sup-ply of amino acids. People with malnutrition, hence, are sus-ceptible to infection by pyogenic bacteria.T-Cell Deficiencies Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Patients with AIDS caused by HIV are highly susceptible to infection by many opportunistic pathogens including bac-teria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. This is attributed to the loss of helper T-cell activity. The virus specifically infects and kills the cells bearing CD4 surface receptors. The immu-nity is highly suppressed, and failure of immune surveil-lance leads to a high incidence of tumors. For detail, refer Chapter 68. Measles T-cell function is altered, but immunoglobulins are normal in patients suffering from measles. Patients show a temporary suppression of delayed hypersensitivity. Complement Deficiencies Liver failure The synthesis of complement proteins is very much reduced in chronic hepatitis B or C and in liver failure caused by alcoholic cirrhosis. Hence, these patients are highly susceptible to infection by pyogenic bacteria. Malnutrition In severe malnutrition, the synthesis of complement proteins by liver is reduced due to low supply of amino acids. Therefore, people with malnutrition are susceptible to infection by pyo-genic bacteria. Phagocyte Deficiencies Neutropenia The condition is characterized by a low neutrophil count (less than 500//H9262L), caused commonly by cytotoxic drugs, such as those used in cancer therapy. The patients are susceptible to severe bacterial infections caused by pyogenic bacteria, such as S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. Immunodeficiency diseases have been summarized in Table 18-1.

It is a harmful immune response in which tissue damage is induced by exaggerated or inappropriate immune responses in a sensitized individual on re-exposure to the same antigen. Both the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune response may participate in hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity essentially has two components. First prim- ing dose (first dose) of antigen is essential, which is required to prime the immune system, followed by a shocking dose (second dose) of the same antigen that results in the injurious consequences. Depending on the time taken for the reactions and the mechanisms that cause the tissue damage, hypersensitivity has been broadly classified into immediate type and delayed type. In the former, the response is seen within minutes or hours after exposure to the antigen and in the latter, the process takes days together to manifest as symptoms. Prince of Monaco first observed the deleterious effects of jel- lyfish on bathers. Subsequently, Portier and Richet (1906) sug-gested a toxin to be responsible for these effects and coined the term \"anaphylaxis\". Gell and Coombs (1963) classified hypersensitivity reac- tions into four categories based on the time elapsed from expo-sure of antigen to the reaction and the arm of immune system involved. Types I, II, and III are antibody-mediated and are known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions, while type IV is cell-mediated (i.e., mediated by cell-mediated immunity) and is known as delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Type V hypersensitivity reaction has been described later. It is called stimulatory type reaction and is a modification of type II hypersensitivity reaction. Differences between immediate and delayed hypersensitivi- ties have been summarized in Table 19-1. Type I (Anaphylactic) Hypersensitivity Type I hypersensitivity reaction is commonly called allergic or immediate hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction is always rapid, occurring within minutes of exposure to an antigen, and always involves IgE-mediated degranulation of basophils or mast cells. Type I reactions are also known as IgE-mediated hypersensi- tivity reactions. IgE is responsible for sensitizing mast cells and providing recognition of antigen for immediate hypersensitiv-ity reactions. The short time lag between exposure to antigen and onset of clinical symptoms is due to the presence of pre-formed mediators in the mast cells. Thus, the time taken for these reactions to initiate is minimal, so the onset of symptoms seems to be immediate. Type I reaction can occur in two forms: anaphylaxis and atopy. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially fatal, and systemic mani-festation of immediate hypersensitivity reaction. It occurs when an antigen (allergen) binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells with the consequent release of several mediators of anaphylaxis. On exposure to the antigen, TH2 cells specific to the antigen are activated, leading to the stimulation of B cells to produce IgE antibody (Fig. 19-1). The IgE then binds to Fc portion of mast cells and basophils with high affinity. On re-exposure to the antigen, the allergen cross-links the bound IgE, followed by activation of IgE and degranulation of basophils and mast cells to release pharmacologically active mediators within minutes. Binding of IgE to the mast cells is also known as sensitiza- tion, because IgE-coated mast cells are ready to be activated on repeat antigen encounter. Initiator cells in anaphylaxis The initiator of type I reaction is otherwise known as allergen. Typical allergens include: Plant pollen, proteins (e.g., foreign serum and vaccines), Certain food items (e.g., eggs, milk, seafood, and nuts), Drugs (e.g., penicillin and local anesthetics), Properties Immediate Delayed Type I, II, III IV Time to manifest Minutes to hours Days Mediators Antibodies T cells Route of sensitization Any route Intradermal Passive transfer with serum Possible Not possible Desensitization Easy but short lived Difficult but long lastingTABLE 19-1Differences between immediate and delayed II Chapter 19150 IMMUNOLOGY Insect products (venom from bees, wasps, and ants), Dust mites, mould spores, and Animal hair and dander. The exact reason for these substances to act as allergens is not known, although they show some common characteristics. Because these reactions are T-cell dependent, T-cell-independent antigens like polysaccharides cannot elicit type I reactions. Effector cells in anaphylaxis The effector cells in anaphylaxis include (a) mast cells, (b) baso-phils, and (c) eosinophils. All these three cells contain cyto-plasmic granules whose contents are the major mediators of allergic reactions. Also, all these three cell types produce lipid mediators and cytokines that induce inflammation.Mast cells: Mast cells are the prime mediators of anaphylaxis. These cells are found throughout connective tissue, particularly near blood and lymphatic vessels. IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells occurs when an allergen causes cross-linkage of the mem-brane-bound IgE. The importance of cross-linkage in the process can be understood by the fact that monovalent molecules, which cannot cause cross-linkage, are unable to cause degranulation. Key Points Activation of mast cells results in three types of biologic responses: secretion of preformed contents of their granules by a regu-lated process of exocytosis; synthesis and secretion of lipid mediators; and synthesis and secretion of cytokines. Mediators of anaphylaxis Many substances instead of a single substance are respon-sible for all manifestations of anaphylaxis. Important media-tors include cellAllergenDegranulation FIG. 19-1. A schematic diagram showing type I hyper sensitivity reaction.Histamine: It is the most important mediator of anaphylaxis. It is found in a preformed state in granules of mast cells and basophils. It causes vasodilatation, increased capillary perme-ability, and smooth muscle contraction. It is the principal mediator of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), urticaria, and angioedema. Antihistamines that block hista-mine receptors are relatively effective against allergic rhinitis but not against asthma.Slow-reacting substances of anaphylaxis: These are pro- duced by leukocytes. These consist of several leukotrienes, which do not occur in preformed state but are produced during reactions of anaphylaxis. Leukotrienes are principal mediators of bronchoconstric- tion in asthma and are not inhibited by antihistamines. They cause increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction.Serotonin: Serotonin is found in preformed state in mast cells and platelets. It causes vasoconstriction, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction.Eosinophilic chemotactic factors of anaphylaxis: It is found in preformed state in granules of mast cells. It attracts eosino-phils to the site of action. The role of eosinophils, however, is not clear in type I hypersensitivity reaction. Nevertheless, it is believed to reduce severity of type I hypersensitivity by releasing the enzymes histaminase and arylsulfatase that and SRS-A, bronchoconstriction and increased permea-bility of capillaries. Thromboxanes cause aggregation of platelets. All these mediators are inactivated by enzymatic reactions very rapidly, hence are active only for a few minutes after their release. Phases of anaphylaxis The spectrum of changes seen in type I hypersensitivity can be considered under immediate and late phases.Immediate phase: This phase is characterized by degranula-tion and release of pharmacologically active mediators within minutes of re-exposure to the same antigen. Histamine is the principal biogenic amine that causes rapid vascular and smooth muscle reactions, such as vas-cular leakage, vasodilatation, and bronchoconstriction. It is responsible for the \"wheal and flare\" response seen in cutaneous anaphylaxis and also for the increased peristalsis and bronchospasm associated with ingested allergens and asthma, respectively. lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins (PGD2) and leukotrienes (LTC4)\u2014which are derived arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase pathway and lipoxygenase path-way, respectively, also cause similar and neutrophil chemotaxis, and aggregation sites.Late phase: This phase begins to develop 4-6 hours after the immediate phase reaction and persists for 1-2 days. It is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, Chap-19.indd 150 eosinophils, and lymphocytes to the site of reaction. This leads to an amplification of the various inflammatory symptoms seen as a part of the early reaction like bronchoconstriction and vasodilatation. The cells remain viable after degranulation and proceed to synthesize other substances that are released at a later time, causing the late phase of type I reactions. The media-tors are not detectable until after some hours of the immedi-ate reaction. The important mediators involved during the late phase are: slow-reacting substances factor; and cytokines from the mast cells. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening reaction usually affect-ing multiple organs. The time of onset of symptoms depends on the level of hypersensitivity and the amount, diffusibility, and site of exposure to the antigen. Multiple organ systems are usually affected, including the skin (pruritus, flushing, urticaria, and angioedema), system (hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias). When death occurs, it is usually due to laryngeal edema, intractable bronchospasm, hypotensive shock, or cardiac arrhythmias developing within the first 2 hours (Table 19.2).Anaphylactoid reaction: This appears to be clinically simi- lar to anaphylactic reaction but differs from it in many ways. First, it is not IgE mediated. Second, the inciting agents (such as drugs or iodinated contrast media) stimulate directly baso-phils and mast cells to release mediators without any involve-ment of the IgE. Management and prevention of anaphylaxis Desensitization is an effective way for prevention of systemic anaphylaxis. It is of two types: acute desensitization and chronic desensitization. Acute desensitization involves the administration of small amounts of antigen to which the person is sensitive, at an inter-val of 15 minutes. The complex of antigen-IgE is produced in small quantities; hence enough mediators are not released to produce a major reaction. However, this action is short lived because of the return of hypersensitivity reaction due to con-tinued production of IgE. Chronic desensitization involves the long-term administra- tion of antigen to which the person is sensitive, at an interval of weeks. This stimulates the production of IgA- and IgG-blocking antibodies that prevent subsequent antigen to binding to mast cells, therefore, preventing the reaction. Administration of drugs to inhibit the action of mediators, maintenance of airways, and support of respiratory and car-diac functions form the mainstay of treatment of anaphylactic reactions. Atopy The term atopy was first coined by Coca (1923) to denote a con-dition of familial hypersensitivities that occur spontaneously in humans. Atopy is recurrent, nonfatal, and local manifesta-tion of immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The reaction shows a high degree of familial predisposition and is associated with a high level of IgE. It is localized to a specific tissue, often involving epithelial surfaces at the site of antigen entry. It is mediated by IgE antibodies, which are homocytotropic (i.e., species specific). Only human IgE can fix to surface of mast cells. Common manifestations of atopy are asthma, rhinitis, bronchial asthma. Atopy is associated with mutations in certain genes encod- ing the alpha chain of the IL-4 receptor. These mutations facilitate the effectiveness of IL-4, resulting in an increased pro-duction of IgE synthesis by B cells. Atopic individuals produce high levels of IgE in response to allergens as against the normal individuals who do not. This depends on the propensity of an individual to mount a TH2 response, because it is only TH2 cell-derived cytokines that stimulates the heavy-chain isotype switching to the IgE class in B cells. Stimulation of heavy chain isotype switching to the IgE class may be influenced by a variety of factors including inher-ited genes, the nature of the antigens, and the history of antigen exposure.

This observation was used in the past for diagnosis of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction by Prausnitz-Kustner reaction. Key Points Prausnitz-Kustner reaction: This is based on the special affinity of IgE antibody for cells of the skin. In this experiment, serum was collected from Kustner who suffered from gastro-intestinal allergy to certain cooked fish. The same serum was given intradermally to Prausnitz, who was then given another intradermal injection of small quantity of cooked fish into the same site, 24 hours' later. This resulted in a wheal and flare at the site of injection within minutes. The test, however, is not done nowadays due to risk of transmission of certain blood-borne viral infections, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Radioallergosorbent test (RAST), enzyme linked immuno- sorbent assay (ELISA), and passive agglutination tests are the frequently used tests for detection of IgE in the serum for diag-nosis of atopy. Type II (Cytotoxic) Hypersensitivity Type II cytotoxic reaction is mediated by antibodies directed against antigens on the cell membrane that activates comple-ment thereby causing antibody-mediated destruction of cells (Fig. 19-2). The cell membrane is damaged by a membrane attack complex during activation of the complement. The reactions involve combination of IgG or IgM antibodies with the cell-fixed antigens or alternately circulating antigens absorbed onto cells. Antigen-antibody reaction leads to com-plement activation, resulting in the formation of membrane attack complex. This complex then acts on the cells, causing damage to the cells, as seen in complement-mediated lysis in Rh hemolytic disease, transfusion reaction, or hemolytic ane-mia. Similarly, the antibodies combining with tissue antigens contribute to the pathogenesis of Goodpasture's syndrome, pemphigus, and myasthenia gravis.Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC): It is another mechanism, which involves the binding of cytotoxic cells with Fc receptors in the Fc binding part of the antibodies coating the target cells. The antibody coating the target cell can also cause its destruction by acting as an opsonin. This mecha-nism is important in immunity against large-sized pathogens, such as the helminths. Transfusion Reactions A large number of proteins and glycoproteins are present on the surface of RBCs, of which A, B, and O antigens are of par-ticular importance. Antibodies to these antigens are called iso-hemagglutinins and are of IgM class. When transfusion with mismatched blood occurs, a transfusion reaction takes place due to the destruction of the donor RBCs through the isohem-agglutinins against the foreign antigen. The clinical manifestations result from the massive intravas- cular hemolysis of the donor cells by antibody and complement. Erythroblastosis Fetalis This condition develops when maternal antibodies specific for fetal blood group antigens cross the placenta and destroy fetal RBCs. This condition is seen in cases where a presensi-tized Rh-negative mother mounts an immune response against Rh-positive RBCs of the fetus. This results in severe hemolysis, leading to anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, which can even be fatal. Drug-Induced Hemolysis Certain drugs (such as penicillin, quinidine, phenacetin, etc.) may induce hemolysis of red blood cells. They attach to the surface of red blood cells and induce formation of IgG anti-bodies. These autoantibodies then react with red blood cell sur-face, causing hemolysis. Similarly, quinacrines attach to surface of platelets and induce autoantibodies that lyse the platelets, causing thrombocytopenia. Goodpasture's Syndrome Autoantibodies of IgG class are produced against basement membrane of the lungs and kidneys in Goodpasture's syndrome. Such autoantibodies bind to tissues of the lungs and kidneys and activate the complement that leads to an increased produc-tion of C5a, a component of the complement. The C5a causes attraction of leukocytes, which produce enzyme proteases that act on lung and kidney tissues, causing damage of those tissues. Rheumatic Fever In this condition, antibodies are produced against group A streptococci that cross-react with cardiac tissues and activate complement and release of components of complement, which in turn causes damage of cardiac tissues.Target cellSurface antigenAntibodyCytotoxic action by NK cell C3bPhagocyteBinding of antibodyto Complement mediated reactions FIG. 19-2.

Chap-19.indd 152 5/14/2012 11:54:44 AMSection II Chapter 19HYPERSENSITIVITY 153 Type III (Immune-Complex) Hypersensitivity Type III reaction is mediated by antigen-antibody immune complexes, which induce an inflammatory reaction in tissues. Mechanism of Immune-Complex Hypersensitivity In many situations, reactions between the various antigens and antibodies in the body give rise to formation of immune complexes (Fig. 19-3). In the normal course, these immune complexes are normally removed by mononuclear-phagocyte system through participation of RBC. However, the body may be exposed to an excess of antigen in many conditions, such as persistent infection with a microbial organism, autoimmu-nity to self-components, and repeated contact with environ-mental agents. When the clearance capacity of this system is exceeded, deposition of the complexes takes place in various tissues. Immune complexes are deposited (a) on blood vessel walls, (b) in the synovial membrane of joints, (c) on the glomerular basement membrane of the kidneys, and (d) on the choroid plexus of the brain. Sometimes, immune complexes are formed at the site of inflammation itself. These in situ immune com-plexes, in certain cases, may be beyond the reach of phagocytic clearance and hence aggregate and cause disease. Immune complexes fix complement and are potent activa- tors of the complement system. Activation of the complement results in the formation of complement components, such as C3a- and C5a-anaphylatoxins that stimulate release of vaso-active amines. The C5a attracts neutrophils to the site, but these neutrophils fail to phagocytose large aggregated mass of immune complexes, and instead release lysosomal enzymes and lytic substances that damage host tissue.The proteolytic enzymes (including neutral proteinases and collagenase), kinin-forming enzymes, polycationic proteins, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates cause damage in the local tissues and enhance the inflammatory responses. Platelets aggregated by intravascular complexes provide yet another source of vasoactive amines and may also form micro-thrombi, which can lead to local ischemia. Manifestations of Immune-Complex Hypersensitivity Arthus reactions and serum sickness reactions are two typical manifestations of type III hypersensitivity. Arthus reactions Arthus reaction is an inflammatory reaction caused by deposi-tion of immune complexes at a localized site. This reaction is named after Dr. Arthus who first described this reaction. This reaction is edematous in the early stages, but later can become hemorrhagic and, eventually, necrotic. The lag time between antigen challenge and the reaction is usually 6 hours. This is considerably longer than the lag time of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, but shorter than that of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Tissue damage is caused by deposition of antigen-antibody immune complexes and complement. The activation of complement through its product of activation causes vascular occlusion and necrosis. Key Points Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is the manifesta-tion of Arthus reaction. Farmer's lung, cheese-washer's lung, wood-worker's lung, and wheat-miller's lung are the examples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis associated with different occupations. All these conditions are caused by inhalation of fungi or bacteria present in different prod-ucts handled by the infected people. Arthus reaction can also occur locally at the site of tetanus immunization, if toxoids are given at the same site within a very short period of 5 years. Serum sickness Serum sickness is a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by deposition of immune complexes at many sites of the body. The condition manifests after a single injection of a high concentration of foreign serum. It appears a few days to 2 weeks after injection of foreign serum or certain drugs, such as peni-cillin. However, serum sickness is considered as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, because symptoms appear immedi-ately after formation of immune complex. Unlike type I hypersensitivity reaction, a single injection acts as both priming and shocking doses. Fever, lymphadenopathy, rashes, arthritis, splenomegaly, and eosinophilia are the typi-cal manifestations. Disease is self-limited and clears without sequelae.

These include the following: 1. Autoimmune diseases Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Rheumatoid arthritis 2. Drug reactions Allergies to penicillin and sulfonamides 3. Infectious diseases Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Meningitis Hepatitis Infectious mononucleosis Trypanosomiasis Type IV Delayed (Cell-Mediated) Hypersensitivity Type IV hypersensitivity reaction is called delayed type hyper-sensitivity (DTH), because the response is delayed. It starts hours or days after primary contact with the antigen and often lasts for days. The reaction is characterized by large influxes of nonspecific inflammatory cells, in particular, macrophages. It differs from the other types of hypersensitivity by being medi-ated through cell-mediated immunity. This reaction occurs due to the activation of specifically sensitized T lymphocytes rather than the antibodies. Initially described by Robert Koch in tuberculosis as a local- ized reaction, this form of hypersensitivity was known as tuber-culin reaction. Later, on realization that the reaction can be elicited in various pathologic conditions, it was renamed as delayed type hypersensitivity. Mechanism of DTH The DTH response begins with an initial sensitization phase of 1-2 weeks after primary contact with an antigen (Fig. 19-4): TH1 subtypes CD4 are the cells activated during the sensi-tization phase. A variety of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including Langerhans cells and macrophages have been shown to be involved in the activation of a DTH response. These cells are believed to pick up the antigen that enters through the skin and transport it to regional lymph nodes, where T cells are activated by the antigen. The APCs present antigens complexed in the groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the cell surface of the APCs. For most protein antigens or haptens associated with skin DTH, CD4 /H11001 T cells are presented with antigens bound to MHC class II alleles, human leukocyte HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ. Specific MHC class II alleles are recognized to produce excessive immune activation to antigens. On subsequent exposure, the effector phase is stimulated. The TH1 cells are responsible in secreting a variety of cyto-kines that recruit and activate macrophages and other non-specific inflammatory cells. The response is marked only after 2-3 days of the second exposure. Generally, the pathogen is cleared rapidly with little tissue damage. However, in some cases, especially if the antigen is not easily cleared, a prolonged DTH response can itself become destructive to the host, as the intense inflam-matory response develops into a visible granulomatous reaction. Types of DTH Reactions DTH reactions are of two types: contact hypersensitivity and tuberculin-type hypersensitivity reactions. Contact hypersensitivity Contact hypersensitivity is a manifestation of DTH occur-ring after sensitization with certain substances. These include drugs, such as sulfonamides and neomycin; plant products, such as poison ivy and poison oak; chemicals, such as formaldehyde and nickel; and cosmetics, soaps and other substances. This reaction manifests when these substances acting as haptens enter the skin and combine with body proteins to become complete antigens to which a person becomes sensi-tized. On second exposure to the same antigen, the immune system responds by attack of cytotoxic T cells that cause dam-age, mostly in the skin. Antigen presenting cell hyper sensitivity reaction. Chap-19.indd 154 5/14/2012 11:54:45 AMSection II Chapter 19HYPERSENSITIVITY 155 The condition manifests as itching, erythema, vesicle, eczema, or necrosis of skin within 12-48 hours of the second exposure. Tuberculin-type hypersensitivity reaction Tuberculin reaction is a typical example of delayed hypersen-sitivity to antigens of microorganisms, which is being used for diagnosis of the disease.Tuberculin skin test: This test is carried out to deter- mine whether an individual has been exposed previously to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or not. In this test, a small amount of tuberculin (PPD), a protein derived from the cell wall of M. tuberculosis, is injected intradermally. Development of a red, slightly swollen, firm lesion at the site of injection after 48-72 hours indicates a positive test. A positive test indicates that the person has been infected with the bacteria but does not confirm the presence of the disease, tuberculosis. However, if a person with a tuberculin-negative skin test becomes positive, then it indicates that the patient has been recently infected. The skin test, however, can even become negative in: Infected persons receiving therapy with immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroids and anticancer drugs) and In those suffering from the diseases associated with sup-pressed cell-mediated immunity (such as AIDS, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, post measles vaccination, etc.). The response to M. tuberculosis illustrates that while on one hand mechanisms involved in DTH are required for defense against the organism; on the other hand, these are also responsible for tissue damage in the longer run. Cytokines (like TNF and IFN-/H9253 ), which have been produced to activate the macrophages and thus contain the infection, also trigger other cascades that lead finally to extensive tissue damage. Various other skin tests are used to detect DTH. These include many skin tests in bacterial, fungal, viral, and helmin-thic infections. Lepromin test is a useful test for leprosy. A positive lepromin test indicates the presence of tuberculoid leprosy with intact cell-mediated immunity. On the other hand, a negative lepro-min test indicates the presence of lepromatous leprosy with impaired cell-mediated immunity. Positive skin tests in coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioido- mycosis and other fungal infections suggest exposure to the fungi. In both viral and parasitic infections, skin tests are less specific and less useful than the serological tests for diagnosis. Differences between contact hypersensitivity and tuberculin- type hypersensitivity reaction are summarized in Table 19-3. Type V (Stimulatory Type) Hypersensitivity In this type of hypersensitivity reaction, antibodies combine with antigens on cell surface, which induces cells to prolifer-ate and differentiate and enhances activity of effector cells. Type V hypersensitivity reaction plays an important role in pathogenesis of Graves' disease, in which thyroid hormones are produced in excess quantity. It is postulated that long-act-ing thyroid-stimulating antibody, which is an autoantibody to thyroid membrane antigen, combines with thyroid-stim-ulating hormone (TSH) receptors on a thyroid cell surface. Interaction with TSH receptor produces an effect similar to the TSH, resulting in an excess production and secre-tion of thyroid hormone, which is responsible for Graves' disease. Table 19-4 summarizes important features of various types of hypersensitivity.Characteristics Contact hypersensitivityTuberculin-type hypersensitivity Site Epidermal Intradermal Antigen Organic chemicals, poison ivy, metals, etc.Tuberculin, lepromin, leishmanin skin tests, etc. Reaction time 48-72 hoursTABLE 19-3 Differences between contact and tuberculin-type hypersensitivity Type I Type II Type III Type IV Antigen Exogenous Cell surface Soluble Tissue and organ Antibody IgE IgG, IgM IgG, IgM None Reaction time 15-30 minutes Minutes to hours 3-8 hours 48-72 hours Transfer Antibody Antibody Antibody T cells Conditions Hay fever, allergy, and asthma Erythroblastosis fetalis and Goodpasture's syndromeSLE, serum sickness Tuberculin test, 19-4 5/14/2012 11:54:45 AMMycobacterium Leprae43 Autoimmunity20 Introduction The immune system is a finely tuned system, which functions round-the-clock whole life to protect the body against various foreign cells, be it microbes or abnormal cells. Though the immune system is up and running all the time surrounded by self-antigens, it does not mount a response against them. At times, these mechanisms go awry, and this results in injury to various tissues. Autoimmunity is a condition when the body produces auto- antibodies and immunologically competent T lymphocytes against its own tissues. Conditions where the mechanisms of self-tolerance fail are termed as autoimmune disorders and the phenomenon is called autoimmunity. Autoimmunity literally means \"protection against self\"; however, in practice it leads to \"injury to self.\" At the clinical level, autoimmunity is apparently involved in a variety of appar-ently unrelated diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and hemolytic anemias. Ehrlich in 1901 first postulated the existence of tolerance to self-antigens as also those situations where this mechanism would fail, leading to \"horror autotoxicus\". More recently, an understanding of the various immunological mechanisms and disorders has led to the same conclusions. Tolerance Tolerance is a state of specific immunological unresponsiveness to a certain antigen or epitope, although the immune system is otherwise functioning normally. The antigens that are present during embryonic life are usually considered self and do not stimulate an immunologic response, hence the host remains tol-erant to those antigens. The absence of an immune response in the fetus is due to the deletion of self-reactive T-cell precursors in the thymus. On the other hand, the antigens that are not pres-ent during the process of maturation are considered nonself and usually elicit an immunologic response against those antigens. Mechanisms of Tolerance Both T cells and B cells participate in tolerance, but it is T-cell tolerance that plays a major role. T-cell tolerance T-cell tolerance is explained by theories of ( a) clonal deletion, (b) clonal anergy, and ( ignorance. 1. Clonal of clonal deletion described by Burnet, Fenner, and Medawar based on their studies on mice was the first theory of tolerance. The recent studies suggest that T lymphocytes acquire the ability to distin-guish self from nonself by the process of clonal deletion during the early phases of life. This process involves the killing of T cells (negative selection) that acts against anti-gens, mainly self-MHC (major histocompatibility com-plex) molecules present in the fetus during that time. The self-reactive cells die by apoptosis, a process of programed cell death.2. Clonal anergy: Clonal anergy is a process that leads to the incapacitation of the self-reactive T cells. These cells become incapable of mounting an immune response due to lack of proper costimulation and are called as anergic.3. Clonal ignorance: This is the term used to describe self- reactive T cells that ignore self-antigens. These self-reactive T cells ignore self-antigens because the antigens are present in very small quantities. Also, these self-reactive cells are kept ignorant by physical separation from the target antigens, such as blood-brain barrier. B-cell tolerance B cells become tolerant to self-antigens also by ( a) clonal dele- tion of B-cell precursors while they are in the bone marrow and (b) clonal anergy of B cells in the periphery. Pathogenesis of Autoimmunity Mechanisms The following mechanisms have been proposed for pathogen-esis of autoimmunity: 1. Release of sequestrated antigens 2. Antigen alteration 3. spreading 4. Chap-20.indd 156 5/14/2012 Chapter 20AUTOIMMUNITY 157 Release of sequestrated antigens Certain tissues, such as sperm, central nervous system, and the lens and uveal system of the eye, are sequestrated or hid-den. These sites are normally never exposed to the immune system for various reasons. These are called immunologically privileged sites. When these hidden or sequestrated antigens are released, exposed to as a result of injury, the host immune system\u2014both cellular and humoral\u2014does not consider them as self but as foreign, and hence attacks them. For example, lens protein is enclosed within its capsule and has no contact with circulation. Therefore, immunological tolerance against lens protein is not developed during fetal life. Following injury or cataract surgery, when this antigen is leaked into circulation, it elicits an immune response, which results in damage to the lens of other eye. Similarly, developing sperms are found within the lumen of the testicular tubules, which are sealed off early in embryonic development, prior to the development of the immune sys-tem. These developing sperms are enclosed within a sheath of tightly joined Sertoli cells, hence are never accessed to immune cells. If these are exposed by surgery or vasectomy and injury, an immune response occurs against the sperm, producing aspermatogenesis that may lead to male sterility. DNA, histones, and mitochondrial enzymes are the intra- cellular antigens that are normally sequestrated from the immune system. However, certain viral or bacterial infections and exposure to radiation and chemicals can damage these cells and release sequestrated intracellular antigens into circu-lation. These antigens then elicit a strong immune response. The autoantibodies are produced against these antigens, which combine with subsequently released sequestrated antigens. This results in the formation of immune complexes, which causes damage to tissues. For example, following an infection by mumps, the virus causes damage to the basement mem-brane of seminiferous tubules, thereby eliciting an immune response and resulting in orchitis. Antigen alteration Certain physical, chemical, or biological factors may alter tis-sue antigens, resulting in formation of new cell surface anti-gens called neoantigens. These neoantigens are no longer recognized as self, therefore, appear foreign to immune system, thereby eliciting an immune response. Procainamide-induced SLE is an example of an autoimmune disease caused by this mechanism. Epitope spreading Epitope spreading is the term used to describe the new expo-sure of sequestrated autoantigens as a result of damage to cells caused by viral infections. It is another process that is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of autoimmunity. These newly exposed autoantigens or epitopes stimulate autoreactive T cells, resulting in autoimmune diseases. For example, in experimental animal infection, a multiple sclerosis-like disease is caused by an infection with an encephalomyelitis virus. In this condition, the self-reactive T cells are directed against cel-lular antigens but not against the virus that cause the sclerosis-like disease. Molecular mimicry Molecular mimicry is a process in which infection by particular microbial pathogen is associated with the subsequent develop-ment of specific autoimmune diseases. Key Points Sharing of M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes and myosin of cardiac muscle is one of many examples of molecular mimicry. Repeated infections with S. pyogenes induce the pro-duction of antibodies against certain M proteins that cross-react with myosin of cardiac muscle, resulting in damage to cardiac tissue, leading to rheumatic fever (Fig. 20-1). Similarly, infection with Shigella spp. or Chlamydia spp. may result in Reiter's syndrome and infection with Campylobacter spp. may lead to Guillain-Barre syndrome. Development of encephalitis in certain cases following vac-cination with rabies Semple vaccine is due to molecular mimicry of sheep brain antigens, used in the vaccine, with that of neural tissues in the brain. Autoimmune Pathological Process The autoimmune pathological process may be initiated and maintained by (a) autoantibodies, (b) immune complexes con-taining autoantigens, and (c) autoreactive T lymphocytes. Each of these immune processes plays a major role in certain diseases or may be synergistically associated, particularly in multiorgan, systemic autoimmune thethroat Destruction of the cardiac valves and adjacent areas by these antibodiesProduction of enormous amounts of IgG antibodies against M protein Binding of IgGantibodies Chapter 201. Autoantibodies: Autoantibody associated diseases are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies in the individ-ual's serum and by the deposition of autoantibodies in tissues. Autoantibodies may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, while in others they may serve simply as dis-ease markers without a known pathogenic role. They may also be instrumental in triggering various pathogenic mechanisms leading to tissue injury and cell death. Autoantibodies play a key role in the pathogenesis of (a) myasthenia gravis, (b) pem-phigus vulgaris, and (c) various autoimmune cytopenias.2. Immune complexes containing autoantigens: The forma- tion of immune complexes between self-antigens and autoan-tibodies, leading to end organ damage, is another pathogenic mechanism seen in autoimmune disorders. Only those immune complexes that are of adequate size manage to activate the com-plement system and are involved in the pathogenesis of autoim-mune diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarteritis nodosa are two classic examples of autoimmune diseases in which immune complexes play a major pathogenic role.3. Autoreactive T lymphocytes: Antigens that are seques-tered from the circulation, and are therefore not seen by the developing T cells in the thymus, do not induce self-tolerance. Exposure of mature T cells to such normally sequestered anti-gens at a later time might result in their activation. Induction of autoantibodies to sperms after vasectomy, sympathetic oph-thalmitis, and the presence of antibodies to myocardial cells after myocardial infarction are the examples. Inappropriate expression of class II MHC molecules can also sensitize self-reactive T cells in certain other situations. This is sup-ported by the clinical observations showing increased frequency of autoimmune diseases in families and by increased rates of clini-cal concordance in monozygotic twins. Polyclonal B-cell activa-tion may also lead to initiation of autoimmune disease process. Animal Models of Autoimmunity Better understanding of autoimmune disease has been facili-tated by many experimental studies in animal models. Several animal models have been developed, each sharing some char-acteristics of a human disease of autoimmune etiology. These animal models often provide only the experimental approaches to the study of pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In some animal models, autoimmune diseases are induced by injecting normal animals with antigens extracted from the human target tissues, resulting in an autoimmune disease with a rapid onset and an acute course. The usual models used are mice and rats. Experimentally induced autoimmune diseases in these animals include (a) myasthenia gravis, (b) multiple sclerosis, (c) rheumatoid arthritis, and (d) Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Autoimmune Diseases Different molecules, cells, and tissues are affected in autoim-mune diseases. Table 20-1 summarizes affected tissue, target antigens, and resultant autoimmune diseases. The autoim-mune diseases can be broadly classified as (a) organ-specific autoimmune disease and (b) systemic autoimmune diseases Organ-Specific Autoimmune Diseases These are diseases in which autoantibodies are produced tar-geting only the tissue of a single organ, thus affecting it solely. A few examples of such disorders are Addison's disease, auto-immune glomerulonephritis, etc. These diseases can be further subgrouped on the basis of tissue damage as: (a) diseases mediated by the action of cell-mediated immunity and (b) diseases mediated by the action of autoantibodies. Diseases mediated by the action of cell-mediated immunity Some of the diseases where the main mechanism of cell damage is directly mediated by lymphocytes are listed below:Hashimoto's thyroiditis: Hashimoto's thyroiditis primarily is a subclinical disease in which no thyroid dysfunction is evi-dent and no therapy is needed until the later stages of disease. A cell-mediated autoimmune reaction triggered by unknown factors is believed to be responsible for the development of this disease. The disease occurs most often in middle-aged women producing both autoantibodies and TH1 cells specific for thy-roid antigens. It is the most common form of thyroiditis, and it usually has a chronic evolution. It occurs most commonly during the third to fifth decades, with a female to male ratio of 10:1. The disease is functionally characterized by a slow pro-gression to hypothyroidism with an insidious onset of symp-toms. Most patients become hypothyroid with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, cold intolerance, and constipation. The diag-nosis is usually confirmed by the detection of antithyroglobu-lin antibodies.Addison's disease (chronic primary hypoadrenalism): This disease can either be caused by exogenous agents (e.g., infec-tion of the adrenals by Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or may be idiopathic. The idiopathic form is believed to have an immune basis, since 50% of patients have been found to have autoanti-bodies to the microsomes of adrenal cells (as compared to 5% in the general population). The autoantibodies directed against the adrenals are believed to play the main role in pathogenesis of the disease. Symptoms of Addison's disease include weakness, fatigabil- ity, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and diarrhea. Signs include increased skin pigmentation, vascular collapse, and hypotension. The disease finally ends in atrophy and loss of function of the adrenal cortex. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of antiadrenal antibodies by indirect immuno-fluorescence test. Addison's disease is found frequently in asso-ciation with other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroiditis, pernicious anemia, and diabetes mellitus.

This usually leads to an overproduction of mediators or an increase in cell growth. Conversely, autoantibodies may act as antagonists, binding hormone receptors but blocking receptor function. This gen-erally causes impaired secretion of mediators and gradual atrophy of the affected organ. Some important representative disorders in this group are mentioned below:Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenia gravis is the prototype auto- immune disease mediated by blocking antibodies. It is a disor-der of neuromuscular transmission. A patient with this disease produces autoantibodies that bind the acetylcholine receptors on the motor end-plates of muscles. These antibodies block the normal binding of acetylcholine and also induce comple-ment-mediated lysis of the cells. Increased muscular fatigue and weakness, especially becoming more pronounced follow-ing exercise, are the usual symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Weakness is usually first detected in extraocular muscles result-ing in diplopia or ptosis. The face, tongue, and upper extremi-ties are also frequently involved. Skeletal muscle involvement is usually proximal. The disease is usually marked by spontane-ous remission periods. Thymic abnormalities are frequent in myasthenia gravis. About 10% of the patients develop malig-nant tumors of the thymus (thymomas). The diagnosis is con-firmed by the finding of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies.Graves' disease: Graves' disease, also known as thyrotoxicosis, diffuse toxic goiter, and exophthalmic goiter, occurs as a result of the production of autoantibodies against the thyrotrophic hormone (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) receptor (TSH receptor antibodies). The TSH receptor antibodies (also known as long-acting thyroid stimulator, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and thyroid-stimulating antibodies) stimulate the activity of thyroid gland in Graves' disease. These antibodies have the Chap-20.indd 159 5/14/2012 12:58:02 PM IMMUNOLOGY 160Section II Chapter 20capacity to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by activating the adenylate cyclase system after binding to the TSH receptor. These antibodies are detected in 80-90% of patients with Graves' disease and are usually of the IgG isotype. Protruding eyeballs, also known as exophthalmos, is the classical presentation of the condition. Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism include increased metabolic rate with weight loss, nervousness, weakness, sweating, heat intol-erance, and loose stools. This disease is more prevalent in women in their 30s. Biopsy of the thyroid gland shows diffuse lymphoplasma- cytic interstitial infiltration. Laboratory tests show increased levels of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, or T3, and thy-roxine, or T4), increased uptake of T3, and antithyroid receptor antibodies. Systemic Autoimmune Diseases The autoantibodies are produced against a wide range of host tissues in systemic autoimmune diseases. These diseases reflect a general defect in immune regulation that results in hyperac-tive T cells and B cells. Tissue damage is widespread, much more generalized and usually leads to multisystem disorders. Tissue damage is caused by cell-mediated immune responses, by auto-antibodies, or by accumulation of immune complexes. A few of the representative systemic diseases are discussed below: Systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a generalized autoim-mune disorder associated with multiple cellular and humoral immune abnormalities and protean clinical manifestations. It is most common in females of childbearing age. It is 10 times more common in females than males. The clinical manifesta-tions of SLE vary among different patients. The kind of organ (vital versus nonvital) that becomes involved determines the seriousness and the overall prognosis of the disease. A wide range of autoantibodies to a vast range of tissue antigens, such as DNA, histones, RBCs, platelets, leukocytes, and clotting fac-tors are produced in patients with SLE. Combination of these autoantibodies with their specific antigens produces a variety of symptoms. Demonstration of lupus erythematosus (LE) cell on incuba- tion of normal neutrophils with damaged leukocytes preincu-bated with sera obtained from SLE patients is typical of SLE. The cell is a peculiar-looking polymorphonuclear leukocyte that has ingested nuclear material. Laboratory diagnosis of SLE is made by demonstration of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in a variety of tissues and cell lines as substrates by an indirect immunofluorescence test. Demonstration of nuclear fluorescence after incubating the cells with the patient's serum indicates a positive test. Four pat-terns of fluorescence can be seen, indicating different types of ANAs. The test for ANAs is not very specific but is very sensi-tive. A negative result virtually excludes the diagnosis of SLE (95% of patients with SLE are ANA positive), while high titers are strongly suggestive of SLE but not confirmatory. False positives can occur in other systemic autoimmune/collagen diseases and chronic infections. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are found almost exclusively in SLE (60-70% of the patients). Levels of serum anti-DNA anti-bodies may vary with disease activity, but they are poor pre-dictors of disease activity. Marked elevations in the levels of circulating immune complexes can be detected in patients with SLE sera during acute episodes of the disease by a variety of techniques. Sunlight exposure is the first environmental factor to be identified that influences the clinical evolution of SLE in a patient. Exposure to sunlight may precede the clinical expression of the disease or disease relapse. This is due to the Langerhans cells of the skin and keratinocytes that release sig-nificant amounts of interleukin-1 upon exposure to UV light. Infections and also drugs are responsible for setting off the disease process in certain susceptible individuals. Treatment of the condition is carried out by administration of corticoste-roids and other anti-inflammatory drugs. Other examples of systemic autoimmune diseases include multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. HLA Association with Autoimmune Diseases The risk for many autoimmune diseases appears to be associ-ated with the presence of particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Some autoimmune diseases have increased fre-quencies in persons carrying certain HLA genes. Table 20-2 summarizes MHC association with some important autoim-mune diseases. 12:58:03 PMImmunology of Transplantation and Malignancy21 Introduction Modern medicine continues to offer many miracles that lengthen the lifespan of humans, as well as greatly increase the quality of life they enjoy. The replacement of defective organs by transplantation was one of the impossible dreams of medi-cine for many centuries. The dream of health professionals have been to replace or restore damaged tissues or organs that are irreparably damaged. The successful transplantation requires a multitude of important steps: surgical asepsis; development of surgical tech-niques of vascular anastomosis; genetic matching of donors with hosts; use of agents that could suppress the immune sys-tem; and prevention of infection in both recipient and donor. The development of strict antiseptic techniques contributes immensely to control the infection, while the proper use of immunosuppressive drugs and tissue typing increases the rate of success of transplantation. Transplant Immunology Transplantation can be defined as the transfer of cells, tissues, or organs from one site in an individual to another, or between two individuals. In the latter case, the individual who provides the transplant organ is termed a donor and the individual receiving the transplant is known as the recipient. Types of Transplants There are four different basic types of transplants. These reflect the genetic relationship of the donor to the recipient. The degree of immune response to a graft varies with the type of graft (Fig. 21-1). 1. Autograft: An autograf t is the transfer of individual's own tissue or organ from one site to another site in the body. In other words, the recipient is also the donor. Com-mon examples of autografts include skin transplants in burn patients and bypass surgery in patients suffering from coronary heart disease. 2. Syngraft: A syngraft is a transfer of tissue between two gene tically identical individuals, i.e., identical twins. The first successful human kidney transplant was a syngraft, carried out in 1954 between identical twins. 3. Allograft: An allograft is the transfer of tissue or an organ be tween genetically different members of the same species, i.e., from one human to another. This is the predominant form of transplantation today, and allografts have domi-nated transplant research for many years. 4. Xenograft: A x enograft is the transfer of tissues or organs between members of different species. It represents the most disparate of genetic relationships and is always rejected by an immunocompetent recipient. A major limitation in the success of transplantation is the immune response of the recipient to the donor tissue. Problem of rejection with autografts is usually minimal or absent. It is only when tissues from \"others\" are used, as in allografts and xenografts, the problem of rejection arises. Transplantation immunology is the study of the events that occur after an allograft or a xenograft is removed from a donor and then transplanted into a recipient. Allograft Rejection Allografts are rejected by a process called allograft reaction. Graft rejection is the consequence of an immune response mounted by the recipient against the graft as a consequence of Same individual Identical twins Different speciesNonidentical individuals XenograftAutograft Syngeneic graft 1:01:30 PM IMMUNOLOGY II Chapter 21 Mechanisms of graft rejection Allogeneic MHC molecules are presented for recognition by the T cells of a graft recipient in two distinctly different ways: (a) direct presentation and (b) indirect presentation.Direct presentation: Direct presentation involves recognition of an intact MHC molecule displayed by donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the graft. It depends on the similarity in the structure of an intact foreign (allogeneic) molecule and self-MHC molecules. Direct recognition of foreign MHC molecules is a cross- reaction of a normal T-cell receptor, which is selected to recog-nize a self-MHC molecule and foreign peptide, with an allogeneic MHC molecule and peptide. This is because an allogeneic MHC molecule with a bound peptide can mimic the determinant formed by a self-MHC molecule and a particular foreign peptide. As many as 2% of an individual's T cells are capable of recogniz- ing and responding to a single foreign MHC molecule, and this high frequency of T cells reactive with allogeneic MHC molecules is one reason that allografts elicit strong immune responses in vivo.Indirect presentation: The \"indirect presentation\" involves the recognition of processed allogeneic MHC molecules but not an intact MHC molecule. It involves processing of donor MHC molecules by recipient APCs and presentation of derived pep-tides from the allogeneic MHC molecules in association with self-MHC molecules. Here the processed MHC molecules are recognized by T cells like conventional foreign protein antigens. Indirect presentation may result in allorecognition by CD4/H11001 T cells. This is because alloantigen is acquired primarily through the endosomal vesicular pathway and is therefore presented by class II MHC molecules. Some antigens of phagocytosed graft cells appear to enter the class I MHC pathway of antigen presen-tation and are indirectly recognized by CD8 /H11001 T cells. Stages of cell-mediated graft rejection Cell-mediated graft rejection could occur in two stages: (a) A sensitization phase, in which antigen-reactive lympho-cytes of the recipient proliferate in response to alloantigens on the graf t and (b) An effector stage, in which immune destruction of the graft t akes place. Sensitization phase: During the sensitization phase, CD4/H11001 and CD8/H11001 T cells recognize alloantigens expressed on the cells of foreign graft and proliferate in response. The response to major histocompatibility antigens involves recognition of both the donor MHC molecule and an associated peptide ligand in the cleft of the MHC molecule. The peptides present in the groove of allogeneic class I MHC molecules are derived from proteins synthesized within the allogeneic cell. The peptides present in the groove of allogeneic class II MHC molecules are generally proteins that are taken up and processed through the endocytic pathway of the allogeneic APC. Recognition of the alloantigens expressed on the cells of a graft induces vigorous T-cell proliferation in the host. This proliferation can be demonstrated in vitro in a mixed lympho-cyte reaction. Both dendritic cells and vascular endothelial the incompatibility between tissue antigens of the donor and recipient. The problem of rejection was first recognized when attempts to replace damaged skin on burn patients with skin from unrelated donors were found to be relatively unsuccess-ful. During a period of 1-2 weeks, the skin would undergo necrosis and peel off. The failure of such grafts led scientists like Peter Medawar and many others to study skin transplanta-tion in animal models. These experiments established that the failure of skin grafting was caused by an inflammatory reac-tion, now called as rejection. Results of several experimental studies imply that adaptive immune response is responsible for rejection.Histocompatibility antigens: Cells expressing class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigens play a major role in sensitizing the immune system of the recipient. The sensiti-zation of alloreactive helper T lymphocytes from the recipient is followed by their clonal expansion. This in turn causes mul-tiple immunological and inflammatory phenomena. Some of these phenomena are mediated by activated T lymphocytes and also by antibodies, which eventually result in graft rejection. Recognition of transplanted cells as self or foreign is deter- mined by polymorphic genes that are inherited from both parents and are expressed codominantly. MHC molecules are responsible for almost all strong rejection reactions. The rejec-tion reactions are mediated by T cells. Both CD4 and CD8 cells coordinate to bring about an effective and pronounced rejec-tion reaction. Nude mice, which lack a thymus, are incapable of launching an allogeneic immune response. Histocompatibility is tissue compatibility as demonstrated in the transplantation of tissues or organs from one member to another of the same species (an allograft), or from one species to another (a xenograft). Key Points The major histocompatibility genes include class I and class II MHC genes that are important in tissue transplanta-tion. These are the genes that encode antigens that should match if a tissue or organ graft is to survive in the recipient and are located in the MHC region. These are located on the short arm of chromosome 6 in humans and of chromo-some 17 in the mouse. Minor histocompatibility antigens are the molecules expressed on cell surfaces that are encoded by the minor histocompatibility loci, not the major histocompatibility locus. They represent weak transplantation antigens than the major histocompatibility antigens. However, they are multiple and their cumulative effect may contribute con-siderably to organ or tissue graft rejection. The greater the match between donor and recipient, the more likely the transplant is to survive. For example, a six- antigen match implies sharing of two HLA-A antigens, two HLA-B anti-gens, and two HLA-DR antigens between donor and recipient. Even though antigenically dissimilar grafts may survive when a strong immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclosporine, is used; the longevity of the graft is still improved by having as many antigenic match as possible. Chap-21.indd 162 5/14/2012 1:01:31 PMSection II Chapter 21IMMUNOLOGY OF TRANSPLANTATION AND MALIGNANCY 163 cells from an allogeneic graft induce host T-cell proliferation. The CD4/H11001 T cell is the major proliferating cell that recognizes class II alloantigens directly or alloantigen peptides presented by host APCs. This amplified population of activated T H cells is believed to play a key role in inducing the various effector mechanisms of allograft rejection.Effector mechanisms in allograft rejection: A variety of effector mechanisms participate in allograft rejection: The most common are and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity. Less common mechanisms are antibody complement lysis and destruction by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). An influx of T cells and macrophages into the graft is the hallmark of graft rejection involving cell-mediated reactions. Histologically, the infiltration in many cases resembles that seen during a delayed-type hypersensitive response, in which cytokines produced by TD and TH cells promote macrophage infiltration. Recognition of foreign class I alloantigens on the graft by host CD8 /H11001 cells results in CTL-mediated killing. In some cases, CD4/H11001 T cells that function as class II MHC-restrict cytotoxic cells mediate graft rejection. Clinical features of graft rejection Rejection episodes, based primarily on the time elapsed between transplantation and the rejection episode, are traditionally classified as (a) hyperacute, (b) acute, and (c) chronic rejections.Hyperacute rejection: Hyperacute rejection occurs usually within the first few hours post-transplantation and is mediated by preformed antibodies against ABO or MHC antigens of the graft. Possibly, antibodies directed against other alloantigens, such as vascular endothelial antigens, also play a role in this type of rejection. Once the antibodies bind to the transplanted tissues, rejection can be caused either (a ) by activation of the complement system, which results in the chemotactic attraction of granulocytes and the triggering of inflammatory circuits, or ( b) by ADCC. Pathological features of hyperacute rejection are following: This is associated with the formation of massive intravascu-lar platelet aggregates leading to thrombosis, ischemia, and necrosis. The hyperacute rejection episodes are irreversible and invariably results in graft loss. With proper cross-matching techniques, this type of rejection is almost 100% avoidable. The hyperacute rejection by antibodies to all human cellular antigens is the major limitation of xenogeneic transplanta-tion (e.g., pig to human). Acute rejection: Acute rejection occurs mostly in the first few days or weeks after transplantation: When acute rejection takes place in the first few days after grafting, it may correspond to a secondary (second set) immune response. This indicates that the patient had been previously sensitized to the HLA antigens present in the organ donor (as a consequence of a previous transplant, pregnancy, or blood transfusions). When graft rejection occurs first week after grafting, it usually corresponds to a first-set (primary) response. Up to 70% of graft recipients experience one or more acute rejection episodes. Acute rejection is predominantly mediated by T lymphocytes. CD4/H11001 helper T lymphocytes are believed to play the key role in acute rejection of the graft. This is because they release growth factors like IL-2 and IL-4 for the promotion of clonal expansion of CD8/H11001 lymphocytes and B cells. In rejected organs, the cellular infiltrates contain mostly monocytes and T lymphocytes of both helper and cyto-toxic phenotypes, and lesser numbers of B lymphocytes, NK ( natural killer) cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. All these cells have the potential to play significant roles in the rejection process. The initial diagnosis of acute rejection is usually based on c linical suspicion: Functional deterioration of the grafted organ is the main basis for considering the diagnosis of acute rejection. Confirmation usually requires a biopsy of the grafted organ. Mononuclear cell infiltration in tissues of rejected graft tissue is characteristic finding. The measurement of cytokines (such as IL-2) in serum and in urine (in the case of renal transplants) is another diagnos-tic approach. In most cases, acute rejection, if detected early, can be reversed by increasing the dose of immunosuppressive agents or by briefly administering additional immunosuppressants.Delayed or chronic rejection: This is characterized by an insidiously progressive loss of function of the grafted organ. The functional deterioration associated with chronic rejec-tion appears to be due to both immune and nonimmune pro-cesses. Vascular endothelial injury is the most common feature. Granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets are found to increas-ingly adhere to injured vascular endothelium. The damaged endothelium is covered by a layer of platelets and fibrin, and eventually by proliferating fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. The end result is a proliferative lesion in the vessels, which pro-gresses toward fibrosis and occlusion. Prevention of graft rejection Immunosuppression of the host prevents graft rejection (Table 21-1). It is achieved by treatment with radiation, cor-ticosteroids, and antilymphocyte serum. Cyclosporin A and rapamycin are also used, which cause immunosuppression by specific inhibition of T cells. Graft-Versus-Host Reaction Whenever a patient with a profound immunodeficiency (primary, secondary, or iatrogenic) receives a graft of an organ rich in immunocompetent cells, there is a considerable risk Chap-21.indd 163 5/14/2012 PM IMMUNOLOGY 164Section II graft-versus-host reaction may develop. The prob-ability of developing a GVH reaction is greatest in the 2-month period immediately following transplantation. GVH reactions require three important components, which are: the donor graft must contain immunocompetent T cells, the host must be immunocompromised, and the recipient should express antigens, such as MHC proteins, which will be identified as foreign to the donor. For example, donor T cells recognize the recipient cells as foreign. Key Points GVH reactions are a significant problem in the following conditions: Transplantation of bone marrow or thymus in infants and children with primary immunodeficiencies. Transplantation of bone marrow in adults. Transplantations of small bowel, lung, and even liver\u2014the organs that have substantial amount of lymphoid tissue. Transplantation of organs, such as the heart and kidneys\u2014poor in endogenous lymphoid tissue\u2014very rarely results in a GVH reaction. GVH reactions occur because the donor T lymphocytes become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into helper and effector cells in the irradiated, immunocompromised host. These activated T cells attack the host cells and tissues, producing the signs and symptoms of GVH disease. The donor's cytotoxic T cells play a key role in destroying recipi-ent's cells. The crucial role played by the donor T cells is dem-onstrated by the fact that removal of these T cells from a bone marrow graft prevents GVH reactions. The initial proliferation of donor T cells takes place in lymphoid tissues, particularly in the liver and spleen leading to hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Later, at the peak of the proliferative reaction, the skin and intestinal walls are heavily infiltrated leading to severe skin rashes or exfoliative dermatitis and severe diarrhea. Finally, many GVH reactions end in over-whelming infections and death. All immunosuppressive drugs used in the prevention and treatment of rejection have been used for treatment of the GVH reaction. Thalidomide, the tranquilizer drug that achieved notoriety due to its teratogenic effects, has been used successfully for the control of chronic GVH unresponsive to traditional immunosuppressants. Tumor Immunology Tumor immunology has been defined as part of immunology that deals with the antigens on tumor cells and the immune response to them. As a consequence of their loss of differen-tiation, tumor cells may express developmental antigens that are usually seen only in the prenatal period. Examples of these antigens are alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen. Tumors or neoplasia is said to develop when the bal-ance between cell death and renewal is disturbed in a way that numerous clones of a single cell group are produced in an uncontrolled fashion. Key Points A tumor that is not capable of indefinite growth and does not invade the healthy surrounding tissue extensively is benign. A tumor that continues to grow and becomes progressively invasive is malignant; the term cancer refers specifically to a malignant tumor. In addition to uncontrolled growth, malignant tumors exhibit metastasis ; in this process, small clusters of cancer- ous cells dislodge from a tumor, invade the blood or lym-phatic vessels, and are carried to other tissues, where they continue to proliferate. In this way a primary tumor at one site can give rise to a secondary tumor at another site. Features of Malignant Cells Malignant cells show the following features: 1. Once cells become malignant, they stop functioning normally and add to the burden on the body by com peting with the normal cells for space and nutrition. 2. The more \"undifferentiated\" a cell is, the lesser its functionality and more its malignant nature. 3. They undergo rapid and uncontrolled division. 4. They lose their homing instinct and st art invading the basement membrane and enter the vasculature to spread to dissimilar tissues, leading to metastasis and spread of cancer.TABLE 21-1 Immunosuppressive Agents used in Transplantation Agent Mode of action Azathioprine Inhibition of nucleotide synthesis of multiple cells Cyclophosphamide Inhibition of nucleotide synthesis of multiple cells Cyclosporine Inhibition of transcription of cytokines in lymphocytes Corticosteroids Inhibition of transcription for cytokines and products involved in inflammation in multiple cells Sirolimus Inhibition of transduction induced by cytokines in T cells Irradiation DNA damage in all rapidly proliferating cells Anti-CD4 and CD8 antibodies Interference with T-cell receptor binding of and CD8 T cells Chap-21.indd 164 5/14/2012 1:01:31 PMSection II Chapter 21IMMUNOLOGY OF TRANSPLANTATION AND MALIGNANCY 165 It has been postulated that the immune system is responsible in part for the protection of the body against the development of malignancies. At the same time, the prevalence of numer-ous cancers in immunocompetent individuals indicates that immune system has only a partial role in protecting against malignancies and also that it is not very efficient at it. Tumor Antigens Tumor cells also express unique molecules that can be classi-fied into two groups: 1. tumor-specific transplantation antigens, are unique to tumors. They are not found on other cells of the body. They are usually the products of mutated genes seen in the cancer cells. Cytosolic processing of the abnormal proteins yields peptides that are unique and when presented by the appropriate MHC class I molecules elicit a cell-mediated immune response. Various physical and chemical carcinogens cause malignan- cies by inducing mutation in key genes involved in modulating cell growth. Ras proto-oncogene products including the p21 Ras pro-teins and other related gene products are an example of TSAs. Ras proteins bind guanine nucleotides (GTP and GDP) and possess intrinsic GTPase activity. The mutations associated with Ras genes in malignant cells appear to cause a single amino acid substitu-tions at specific positions (12, 13, or 61), which results in increased enzymatic activity of the gene product. As a consequence, the cells acquire transforming capacity. Moreover, these products are also recognized as foreign antigens by the cellular immune response. Another mode through which the tumor cells may express unique and novel antigens \"is by\" integration with proviral genomes. These have their genome integrated with proviral genome, hence the proteins encoded and expressed are sometimes novel and recognized by the cellular immune response. Viruses that have been implicated in tumorigenesis include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis etc. Tumor-associated transplantation antigens Tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATAs) are the other class of tumor antigens. These antigens are expressed by (a ) tumor cells and also by ( b) normal cells at low levels or only dur- ing the process of differentiation. The expression of these anti-gens is considerably derepressed or enhanced after the process of malignant transformation. TATAs can be of the following types:1. Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens: They represent abnormal form of mucin-associated antigen detected in breast and pancreatic cancers.2. Differential antigens: These include CD10 and prostate-specific antigens (PSA). The latter is used as diagnostic indica-tor in prostatic cancer.3. Oncofetal antigens: These antigens are found in embryonic and malignant cells but are absent in normal adult cells. Alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigens are examples of this antigen, which are found in hepatomas and colonic cancers, respectively. Silent tumor-associated genes are not expressed in normal cells but are actively transcribed in tumor cells. Tissue-specific genes or differentiation genes are present in the surface of normal cells or may be shed to the circulation, but the levels of expression are usually very low in normal cells. This finds practi-cal application in the diagnosis of malignancies as illustrated by the assay of PSA for the diagnosis of carcinoma of prostate.PSA: It is a kallikrein-like serine protease produced exclusively by the epithelial cells in the prostate gland. The antigen is detectable at relatively high levels in seminal plasma and at very low levels in the serum of healthy men. The assay of serum PSA levels is a very useful marker of prostate carcinoma, perhaps the most meaning-ful serum marker for neoplasia. In healthy men, the levels of PSA vary between 0.65 /H11006 0.66 ng/mL at ages 21-30 and 1.15 /H11006 ages 61-70. Significantly elevated levels are demon-strated in 63-86% of patients with prostatic carcinoma, depend-ing on the stage. In essence, antigens of tumors that are capable of eliciting an immune response may be one of the following nature: First, these antigens are uniquely expressed by tumor cells alone. Also, there are the products of genes that have been mutated during the process of transformation, leading to the expression of abnormal products. Second, certain antigens expressed by tumors are present only when normal cells are undergoing the process of dif-ferentiation and these are also readily recognized by the immune system. Finally, the antigens that are overexpressed by the tumor cells elicit a good immune response. Immune Reactions against Tumors Tumor antigens are capable of eliciting a comprehensive immune response involving both the cellular and humoral immune responses. Cellular immune responses T lymphocytes play an important role in tumor immunity. They act both as cytotoxic effector cells and as central modulating cells. Through these effector cells, they control the specific cell-mediated antitumor immune responses and upregulate non-specific killing mechanisms. The activation of T lymphocytes by tumor cell products as a consequence of antigen recognition may result in the secretion of nonspecific immunoregulatory factors. These factors are capable of \"upregulating\" the tumor-killing function of mononuclear phagocytes, NK cells, and granulocytes. These factors also enhance the ability of NK cells and mono-cytes to participate in ADCC against tumor cells. Macrophages also play an important role in tumor response. Clustering of macrophages around tumor cells is associated with tumor regression and seen in the case of numerous cancers. Chap-21.indd 165 5/14/2012 1:01:31 PM IMMUNOLOGY 166Section II Chapter 21 Humoral immune responses B lymphocytes produce tumor-specific antibodies, which may induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity of tumor cells or may mediate ADCC. ADCC can be mediated by a variety of cells expressing Fc/H9253 receptors (NK cells, monocytes or macrophages, and granulocytes) by recognizing and destroying IgG-coated tumor cells. Immunosurveillance The emergence of cancer cells within the body may not be a rare or unusual event at all. Of the trillions of normal cells found in the body, several hundred per day may be undergoing malignant degeneration in response to the cancer-promoting stimuli. The immune system may possibly play a significant role in halting the growth of these cells and preventing the development of overt malignancy. The concept of immune surveillance was initially put for- ward by Ehrlich, and later on modified by Thomas and Burnet. Ehrlich first suggested that though cancer cells frequently arise in the body, they are recognized as foreign and eliminated. Later, Burnet postulated the immunosurveillance theory. He suggested that the immune system routinely patrols the cells of the body and upon recognition of a cell or a group of cells that has become cancerous attempts to destroy them, thus pre-venting the growth of some tumors. Immunotherapy of Cancer Immunotherapy of cancer can be considered as the following two broad groups: 1. Antigen-nonspecific treatment 2. Antigen-specific treatment Antigen-nonspecific treatment This includes treatment with various nonspecific immune modulators. Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine has been shown to possess antitumor activity. The vaccine when injected directly into certain solid tumors may cause regression of tumor. Antitumor effect of tumor is believed to be due to activation of macrophages and NK cells. The BCG therapy has been reported to be beneficial in treatment of bladder cancer, malignant melanomas, stage I lung cancer, and cer-tain leukemias. Corynebacterium parvum also possesses antitumor activities. Its antitumor effect is due to its ability to stimulate macro-phages and B cells. It shows a synergistic effect when used in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. It is found to be useful in treatment of metastatic breast cancer and various types of lung cancer. Other nonspecific immune modulators include (i) dinitro-chlorobenzene (DNCB), evaluated in squamous and basal carcinoma, (ii) levamisole for stimulating cell-mediated immunity and macrophage function, (iii) interferon to stim-ulate NK cell function, (iv) cytokine IL-2 to stimulate killing of cancer cells by cytotoxic T cells, ( v) NK cells, and mac- rophages, thymic hormones to restore T cell function, and (vi) tuftsin to stimulate phagocytic cells. Antigen-specific treatment Antigen-specific treatment includes (a) vaccination with tumor antigen, (b) treatment with transfer factor, (c) treatment with immune RNA, (d) treatment with monoclonal antibodies raised against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) given alone or in conjunction with cytotoxic drug, and (e) modification of tumor antigenicity by treatment with neuraminidase. Chap-21.indd 166 5/14/2012 1:01:31 PMImmunohematology22 Introduction Immunohematology is the study of blood group antigens and antibodies, and their interactions in health and disease. Ehrlich and Morgenroth first described blood groups in goats based on antigens of their red cells in an article published in the Berliner klinische Wochenschrift in 1900. Subsequently, Karl Landsteiner, a Viennese pathologist, successfully identified the human ABO blood groups for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize 30 years later. After this initial discovery, blood grouping was developed as a science, and many different systems of grouping were designed on the basis of many isoantigens on the surface of erythrocytes. The ABO and Rh systems are among the well-known human blood groups described in the literature. ABO Blood Group System ABO blood group system was the first human red-cell antigen system to be characterized. The ABO blood group substances are glycopeptides with oligosaccharide side chains (Fig. 22-1). The ABO blood group specificity is determined by the presence of terminal sugar in an oligosaccharide structure. The terminal sugars of the oligosaccharides are specific for blood groups A and B. They are also immunogenic. The red cells express either A, B, both A and B, or neither, and antibodies are found in serum to antigens not expressed by the red cells.ABO Blood Group Antigens The blood group of an individual is determined by presence or absence of two antigens, A and B, on the surface of the red cell membrane. Red cells of blood group A carry antigen A, cells of blood group B carry antigen B, and cells of blood group AB have both A and B antigens. On the other hand, blood group O cells have neither A nor B antigens. The blood groups are also differentiated by the presence or absence of two distinct isoantibodies in the serum. Serum of blood group A individuals have anti-B antibodies, blood group B have anti-A antibodies, and blood group O have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. The blood group AB does not contain any anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the serum. Soluble ABO blood group substances may be found in mucous secretions of humans, such as saliva, gastric juice, ovarian cyst fluid, etc. Such persons are termed secretors, while those without the blood group substances in their secretions are nonsecretors. The ABO group of a given individual is determined by test- ing both cells and serum. In this method, the subject's red cells are mixed with serum containing known antibody and the sub-ject's serum is tested against cells possessing known antigen. For example, the cells of a group A individual are agglutinated by anti-A serum but not by anti-B serum, and his or her serum agglutinates type B cells but not type A cells. The typing of cells as group O is done by exclusion (a cell not reacting with anti-A or anti-B is considered to be of blood group O). It is Erythrocyte A enzyme H enzyme H substanceA blood group B blood group O blood group O enzyme (inactive)B enzyme R R GalactoseFucose N-acetylgalactosamineN-acetylglucosamineRR R + blood group 167 5/14/2012 5:53:29 PMSection II Chapter 22168 IMMUNOLOGY noteworthy that these antibodies to the isoantigens are found in all individuals including those that have had no transfusions. It is believed that the anti-A and anti-B isoagglutinins are synthesized as a consequence of cross-immunization with bac-teria of the family Enterobacteriaceae that colonize the infants' gut. These bacteria have outer membrane oligosaccharides strikingly similar to those that define the A and B antigens in the human body. For example, a newborn with group A will not have anti-B in his or her serum, since there has been no oppor-tunity to undergo cross-immunization. When the intestine is eventually colonized by the normal microbial flora, the infant will start to develop anti-B, but will not produce anti-A because of tolerance to his or her own blood group antigens. The inheri-tance of the ABO groups follows simple Mendelian rules, with three common allelic genes: A, B, and O (A can be subdivided into A1 and A2), and any individual will carry two alleles, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. H antigen Red cells of all ABO groups possess a common antigen, the H anti-gen, or H substance. H antigen is a glycoprotein and structurally is an L-fucose. It is a precursor for the production of A and B antigens. A and B antigens are formed by addition of N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose, respectively, to L-fucose of H antigen. The H antigen, due to its universal distribution, is not that important in blood grouping or transfusion. However, in rare instances, such as in \"Bombay,\" or OH blood, both A and B anti-gens as well as H antigens are absent in the blood. Individuals with \"Bombay\" blood group have anti-A, anti-B, and anti-H antibodies, hence are not compatible with most of the red cells. Rh Blood Group System Philip Levine, in 1939, discovered that the sera of most women who gave birth to infants with hemolytic disease contained an antibody that reacted with the red cells of the infant and with the red cells of 85% of Caucasians. In 1940, Landsteiner and Wiener injected blood from the monkey Macacus rhesus into rabbits and guinea pigs, and discovered the resulting antibody agglutinated rhesus (Rh) red cells, which appeared to have the same specificity as the neonatal antibody. The donors whose cells were aggluti-nated by the antibody to Rh red cells were termed Rh positive; those whose cells were not agglutinated were termed Rh negative. It is now known that the antibody obtained by Landsteiner and Wiener reacts with an antigen (LW) is different but is closely related to the one that is recognized in human hemolytic disease, but nevertheless the Rh nomenclature is still retained. Rh Blood Group Antigens The term Rh blood group system refers to the five main Rh antigens (C, c, D, E, and e) as well as many other less frequent Rh antigens. The terms Rh factor and Rh antigen are similar, and both refer to the RhD antigen only. Of all the Rh antigens, antigen D (RhD) is most important. D antigen Individuals either have or do not have the RhD antigen on the surface of their red blood cells. This is usually indicated by \"RhD positive\" (does have the RhD antigen) or \"RhD negative\" (does not have the antigen) suffix to the ABO blood type. This suffix is often shortened to \"D pos\"/\"D neg,\" \"RhD pos\"/\"RhD neg,\" or /H11001//H11002. The latter symbol is generally not preferred in research or medical situations, because it can be altered or obscured accidentally. There are several alloantigenic determi-nants within the Rh system. Clinically, the D antigen has a lot of medical importance. This is because RhD negative individuals who receive RhD posi-tive erythrocytes by transfusion can develop alloantibodies that may lead to severe reactions with further transfusions of RhD-positive blood. The D antigen also poses a problem in RhD-negative moth-ers who bear a child with RhD-positive red cells inherited from the father. The entry of fetal erythrocytes into the maternal circulation at parturition or trauma during the pregnancy (such as in amniocentesis) can lead to alloim-munization against the RhD antigen. This may cause hemolytic disease of the newborn in subsequent pregnan-cies. This can now be prevented by the administration of Rh (D) immunoglobulin to these women within 72 hours of parturition. Unlike ABO system, there are no natural antibodies against Rh antigens. Antibodies against Rh antigens develop only in certain situations, such as in Rh incompatible pregnancy or transfusion. Most of these antibodies are IgG antibodies, and few IgM antibodies. These are incomplete antibodies and can be detected in newborn blood by direct Coombs' test and in mother blood by indirect Coombs' test. Blood Transfusion Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood-based products from one person into the circulatory system of another. Blood transfusions have many indications as mentioned below: Blood transfusions can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. Blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People suffering from hemophilia or sickle-cell disease may require frequent blood transfusions. Before a blood transfusion, a series of procedures need to be done to establish the proper selection of blood for the patient. Basically, those procedures try: to establish ABO and Rh compatibility between donor and recipient and to rule out the existence of antibodies in the recipient's serum, which could react with transfused red cells. Chap-22.indd 168 5/14/2012 5:53:29 PMSection II Chapter 22IMMUNOHEMATOLOGY 169 To establish the ABO and Rh compatibility between donor and recipient, both the recipient and the blood to be transfused are typed. The most direct way to detect antibodies in the recip ient's serum that could cause hemolysis of the transfused red cells is to test the patient's serum with the donor's cells (major cross-match). The minor cross-match, which consists of testing a patient's cells with donor serum is of little significance and rarely performed, since any donor antibodies would be greatly diluted in the recipient's plasma, and rarely, it causes clinical problems.Universal recipient: It is an ABO blood group individual whose red blood cells express antigens A and B, but whose serum does not contain anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Thus, red blood cells containing any of the ABO antigens, i.e., from an individ-ual with type A, B, AB, or O, may be transfused to the universal recipient without inducing a hemolytic transfusion reaction. It is best if the universal recipient is Rh positive, i.e., has the RhD antigen on the erythrocytes to avoid developing a hemo-lytic transfusion reaction. However, blood group systems other than ABO may induce hemolytic reactions in a universal recipi-ent. Thus, it is best to use type-specific blood for transfusions.Universal donor: It is a blood group O RhD-negative individ-ual whose erythrocytes express neither A nor B surface antigens. This type of red blood cell fails to elicit a hemolytic transfusion reaction in recipients with blood group A, B, AB, or O. However, group O individuals serving as universal donors may express other blood group antigens on their erythrocytes that may induce hemolysis. It is preferable to use type-specific blood for transfusions, except in cases of disaster or emergency. Complications of Blood Transfusion Transfusion reaction is the major immunological complication following incompatible blood transfusion. Other transfusion reactions may be caused due to factors other than incompat-ibility, such as a person being hypersensitive to some allergens present in the blood. Transmission of infectious agents through blood is the most important complication. These include: Viruses, such as human immunodeficiency viruses I and II (HIV I and II), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and (CMV); Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium species. Transmission of HIV I and II, HBV, and HCV, which is a major concern. Hemolytic Disease of Newborn (Erythroblastosis Fetalis) Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as HDN, is an alloimmune condition. It develops in a fetus, which contains the IgG antibodies that have been produced by the mother and have passed through the placenta. These antibodies subsequently attack and lyse the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, result-ing in reticulocytosis and anemia. This condition in fetus varies from mild to very severe, and fetal death may occur due to heart failure (hydrops fetalis). When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts are present in the fetal blood, and this form of the disease is called erythroblastosis fetalis. Immunological destruction of fetal and/or newborn eryth- rocytes is likely to occur when IgG antibodies are present in the maternal circulation directed against the antigen(s) present on the fetal red blood cells. This is because only IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and reach the fetal circulation. Anti-D and anti-A or anti-B are the two types of antibodies most usually involved in hemolytic disease of the newborn. Anti-A or anti-B antibodies are usually IgM, but, in some circumstances, IgG antibodies may develop (usually in group O mothers). This can be secondary to immune stimulation (some vaccines contain blood group substances or cross-reactive polysaccharides), or may occur without apparent cause for unknown reasons. Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an antigen foreign to the make-up of the body. If a mother is exposed to an alien antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to IgM which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will com-bine with the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it in utero and persist after delivery (Fig. 22-2). Rh/RhRh/Rh+ Rh/Rh+ fetusRh/Rh fetus Mother not PMSection II Chapter 22170 IMMUNOLOGY The three most common ways in which a woman becomes sensitized (i.e., produces IgG antibodies against) toward particular blood types are as follows: 1. Fetal-maternal hemorrhage can occur due to trauma, childbir th, ruptures in the placenta during preg- nancy, or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these anti-bodies then cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream, combine with the red blood cells, and finally cause hemo-lysis. In other words, if a mother has anti-RhD (D being the major Rh antigen) IgG antibodies as a result of previously carrying an RhD-positive fetus, these antibodies will only affect a fetus with RhD-positive blood. 2. The woman may receive a therapeutic blood transfusion with an incompatible blood type. ABO blood group sys-tem and Rh blood group system typing are routine prior to transfusion. Suggestions ha ve been made that women of childbearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or Kell-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization. However, it is considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups. 3. The third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The immune response to A and B antigens, which are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM anti- A and IgM anti-B antibodies early in life. On rare occasions, IgG antibodies are produced. In contrast, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens. A positive direct Coombs' (antiglobulin) test with cord RBC is invariably positive in cases of Rh incompatibility. In ABO incompatibility, the direct antiglobulin test is usually weakly positive and may be confirmed by eluting antibodies from the infant's red cells and testing the elute with A and B cells. Before birth, treatment of the condition include intrauter- ine transfusion or early induction of labor when ( a) pulmo- nary maturity has been attained, (b) fetal distress is present, or (c) 35-37 weeks of gestation have passed. The mother is also administered with plasma to reduce the circulating levels of antibody by as much as 75%. After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condi- tion. These include temperature stabilization, phototherapy, transfusion with compatible packed red blood cells, admin-istration of sodium bicarbonate for correction of acidosis, and/or assisted ventilation and exchange transfusion with a blood cells, type compatible with both the infant and the mother.Rh-negative mothers who have had a pregnancy with or are pregnant with an Rh-positive infant are given Rh immuno-globulin (RhIG) during pregnancy and after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. The RhIG acts by binding any fetal red cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG. All the offsprings of Rh-incompatible marriages, however, do not suffer from hemolytic diseases of newborn. This may be due to either of the following causes:1. Mother-fetus ABO incompatibility: When the mother and fetus possess the same ABO group, Rh immunization is more likely to occur. However, when Rh and ABO incompat-ibility coexist, Rh sensitization from the mother is very rare. In this condition, the fetal cells entering the maternal circulation are destroyed rapidly by the ABO antibodies before they can form the Rh antibodies.2. Immune unresponsiveness to Rh antigen: Some Rh-negative individuals even after repeated injections of Rh-positive cells fail to form Rh antibodies. Such individuals are known as nonresponders. The exact reason for such immu-nological unresponsiveness, however, is not known.3. Number of pregnancies: The risk of hemolytic disease of new born is more in second and successive child, but not in first child. This is because sensitization occurs only during the delivery; hence the first child escapes. ABO Hemolytic Diseases ABO hemolytic diseases occur in a very less number of cases, even though materno-fetal ABO incompatibility is very common. The condition is usually seen in O group mothers bearing blood group A or B fetus. It occurs largely in O group mothers because the isoantibodies are largely IgG in nature, which can cross the placenta. It does not occur in mothers with blood groups A or B because natural antibodies are mainly IgM in nature, which does not cross the placenta and sensitize the fetus. Unlike hemolytic disease of the newborn, the ABO hemo- lytic diseases can occur even in first child even without prior immunization. This is because the ABO disease is caused by naturally occurring maternal isoantibodies. ABO hemolytic disease is much milder condition than that of the Rh disease. The diagnosis of ABO incompatibility is made by a positive indirect Coombs' test but a negative direct Coombs' test. Peripheral blood smear characteristically Family Micrococcaceae consists of Gram-positive cocci, which are aerobic and anaerobic, and are arranged in tetrads or clus-ters. Micrococcaceae consists of four genera, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Planococcus, and Stomatococcus. Differences between these genera are summarized in Table 23-1. Human infections caused by these genera are summarized in Table 23-2. Among these, Staphylococcus is the only genus of medical importance. Staphylococcus The genus Staphylococcus consists of 32 species, most of which are animal pathogens or commensals. The bacteria belonging to this genus are aerobic and facultative anaerobic, catalase positive, oxidase negative, and are arranged in clusters, pairs, or tetrads. Staphylococcus aureus is the most important human pathogen. The other important human pathogens are coagulase- negative staphylococci which , and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Staphylococci are capable of acquiring resistance to many antibiotics and therefore can cause major clinical and epidemiological problems in hospitals. Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus is an important human pathogen that causes a spec-trum of clinical diseases. These range from superficial skin lesions like folliculitis to deep-seated abscess and various pyogenic infections like endocarditis, osteomyelitis, etc. The bacterium also causes toxin-mediated diseases, such as food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Staphylococci show following features: They are Gram-positive cocci, measuring around 1 /H9262m in diameter. They are nonmotile, nonsporing. They are noncapsulated. They, however, contain a microcapsule, which can be visualized by electron micro-scope only, but not by a light microscope.Staphylococcus Bacteria Diseases Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Staphylococcus epidermidis Opportunistic infections\u2014intravenous catheter infections, CSF shunt infections, endocarditis in \"immunocompromised\" patients Staphylococcus saprophyticus Urinary tract infection particularly in sexually active young women Micrococcus spp. Opportunistic infections Stomatococcus spp. Opportunistic infections, bacteremia, BACTERIOLOGY Color Photo 12). Hemolysis is well marked on sheep or rabbit blood agar, especially when incubated in an atmo-sphere of 20-25% CO 2. Sheep blood agar is used for pri- mary isolation. Hemolysis is weak on horse blood agar. Human blood is not used, as it may contain antibiotics or other inhibi-tors. Other species of Staphylococcus do not produce hemolysis. 3. MacConkey agar: S. aureus produces small pink colonies due to ferment ation of lactose. 4. Selective media: are the commonly used selec-tive media for isolation of S. aureus from clinical specimens containing normal bacterial flora (e.g., stools). Mannitol salt agar contains 1% mannitol, 7.5% sodium chloride, and indicator. Most strains of S. aureus fer-ment mannitol with acid production, which gives rise to yellow zone formation around the colonies. Culture in liquid media: S. aureus produces turbidity in liquid media and there is no production of pigment. Biochemical reactions S. aureus shows following reactions: It is coagulase positive. The production of coagulase is used as a test to differentiate S. aureus from S. epidermidis and other CONS. It is phosphatase positive. Phosphatase production can also be used to differentiate S. aureus from S. epidermidis, as the latter either does not produce or has very weak phosphatase activity. It is catalase positive. It produces enzyme catalase (unlike Streptococcus), which degrades H 2O2 into nascent oxygen and water. is negative. S. aureus ferments mannitol, sucrose, maltose, and trehalose under aerobic conditions, with the production of acid but no gas. Fermentation of mannitol is of diagnostic impor-tance, because most strains of S. aureus ferment manni-tol while those of S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus do not ferment mannitol. It liquefies gelatin, hydrolyzes urea, reduces nitrate to \"methyl red (MR)\" posi-tive but indole negative. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: The cocci withstand moist heat at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes but are killed after 30 minutes. They are also killed rapidly by disinfectants, such as phenol, chlorhexidine, and hexachlorophene. The cocci are very sensitive to aniline dyes, such as crystal violet. The dye at a concentration of 1:500,000 inhibits the growth of the cocci on blood agar medium but permits the growth of streptococci.The cocci are typically arranged in irregular grape-like clusters. This appearance is due to incomplete separation of daughter cells during successive divisions of bacteria, which takes place in perpendicular planes. The grape-like clustering is seen when the bacteria are grown in solid media, but usually short chains are seen when grown in liquid media. In smears taken from pus, the cocci are present either singly or in pairs, in clusters, or in short chains of three or four cells. Culture Staphylococci are aerobes and facultative anaerobes but can grow in the absence of oxygen also. They grow at a tempera-ture range of 10-42\u00b0C (optimum temperature 37\u00b0C) and a pH range of 7.4-7.6 (optimum pH 7).Culture on solid media: Staphylococci can grow on a wide range of media Mueller-Hinton agar, nutrient agar, blood agar, and on nutrient agar and blood agar. 1. Nutrient agar: S. aureus produces round, conv ex, well- defined colonies measuring 2-4 mm in diameter. The colo-nies show a butyrous consistency with a smooth glistening surface. S. aureus produces characteristic golden-yellow colonies due to production of a nondiffusible golden-yellow pig-ment. The pigment is believed to be a lipoprotein allied to carotene. The production of the pigment is enhanced by incubation at 22\u00b0C in the presence of oxygen. Milk agar and 1% glycerol monoacetate agar are other media that facilitate the production of pigment. On nutrient agar slopes, the growth gives a characteristic \"oil paint\" appearance. 2. Blood agar: S. aureus produces a clear zone of hemoly- sis (bet a-hemolysis) surrounding the colonies (Fig. 23-1, FIG. 23-1. Blood agar plate showing beta-hemolysis surrounding the of St aphylococcus aureus. Chap-23.indd 174 5/14/2012 5:54:36 PMSection III Chapter 23STAPHYLOCOCCUS 175 Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Cell wall associated proteins and polymers include the follow-ing (Fig. 23-2): Cell wall peptidoglycan S. aureus cell wall is rich in peptidoglycans. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of the polysaccharide, which provides rigidity to the cell wall of the bacteria. It has the characteristic penta glycine bridges that link tetrapeptides to the wall structur ysaccharide slime la yer Clumping factor Peptidogl ycan layer FIG. 23-2.

It is a polymer of ribitol phosphate. Antibodies to teichoic acids develop in endocarditis and in certain other staphylococcal infections. Protein A It is the major protein in the cell wall and has a molecular weight of 13,000 Da. It is present in large quantities in the cell wall of certain strains of S. aureus, such as the Cowan's strain of S. aureus (SAPA). This is a group specific antigen. The anti- gen is present in more than 90% strains of S. aureus. Protein A is absent in both the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) and micrococci. Pathogenesis and Immunity S. aureus causes disease by multiplying in tissues and causing inflammation, and also by liberating toxin. Virulence factors S. aureus produces several virulence factors (Table 23-3), which include the following: (a) Cell wall associated proteins and polymers (b) Extracellular enzymes (c) H2O2 to nascent oxygen and water. This nascent oxygen causes oxidative damage of host tissue. This enzyme is produced after phagocytosis or during metabolism of the bacteria. All strains of staphylococci produce catalase unlike streptococci.Hyaluronidase: The enzyme hyaluronidase hydrolyzes the acidic mucopolysaccharides present in the matrix of the connective tissues, thereby facilitating the spread of bacteria in tissues.Penicillinase: More than 90% of S. aureus produce enzyme penicillinase. The enzyme inactivates penicillin group of antibiotics, hence is responsible for widespread occurrence of penicillin-resistant staphylococci. The gene for this enzyme is syndrome toxin, (b) enterotoxin, (c) exfoliative toxin, (d) leukocidins, and (e) hemolysins.Toxic shock syndrome toxin: Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) is a protein with a molecular weight of 22,000 Da and resembles enterotoxin F and exotoxin C. It is antigenic. Production of toxin is pH dependent and occurs at pH 7-8. The toxin causes toxic shock syndrome (TSS). S. aureus strains responsible for menstruation-associated TSS and half of the strains responsible for non- menstruation associated TSS produce TSST-1. The strains producing TSST-1 belong to the bacteriophage group I. TSST is a superantigen and hence a potent stimulant of T lymphocytes, resulting in release of large amount of inter-leukins (IL-1 and IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor, ultimately manifesting in TSS. Enterotoxin: Enterotoxin is a heat-stable protein, capable of resisting boiling for about 30 minutes. It is also gut-enzyme resistant. The toxin is produced by nearly one-third of all the strains of S. aureus, and these strains belong to bacterio-phage group III (6/47). Nine antigenic types (A, B, C 1,2,&3, D, E, G, H, I, and J) of enterotoxins have been described, out of which type A and B are most important. These proteins are of molecular weights ranging from 26,000 to 30,000 Da.Cell wall associated proteins and polymers These include capsular polysaccharide, protein A, peptido-glycan, and that contribute to pathogenesis of staphylococcal diseases.Capsular polysaccharide: Few strains of S. aureus are capsulated. These strains are more virulent than the noncapsulated ones. The capsule protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. The capsule also facilitates adherence of the cocci to host cells and to prosthetic implants. Protein A: Protein A is an important virulence factor since it has non-specific interaction with Fc portion of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) leaving the Fab portions free to combine with specific antigen. It is chemotactic, anticomplementary, and antiphagocytic. It causes platelet injury reactions. Peptidoglycan: It activates the complement, stimulates production of the antibodies, and inhibits chemotaxis by inflammatory cells.Teichoic acid: It mediates attachment of staphycocci to mucosal cell. Extracellular enzymes The enzymes include (a) coagulase, (b) catalase, (c) hyaluroni-dase, (d) penicillinase, and (e) other enzymes.Coagulase: S. aureus has a unique ability to clot a variety of mammalian plasma. Clotting of plasma is brought about by the action of the enzyme coagulase secreted by the pathogenic strains of S. aureus. The enzyme coagulase is of two types: (a) free coagulase and (b) bound coagulase.A. Free coagulase: Free coagulase is a heat-labile and filter-able enzyme. It has eight antigenic types (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). Antigenic type A is produced by most human S. aureus strains. The enzyme coagulase in association with coagulase-reacting factor (CRF) present in plasma converts fibrinogen to fibrin. In the absence of CRF, coagulase cannot bring about clotting like in case of the guinea pig plasma. This fibrin coats the bacterial cells, rendering them resistant to opsonization and phagocytosis and hence making bacteria more virulent. All coagulase-producing staphylococci are, by definition, S. aureus. Coagulase production is demonstrated by tube coagulase test, which is an important test for the identification of S. aureus.B. Bound coagulase: Bound coagulase is otherwise known as clumping factor. It is a heat-stable protein and is present in the cell wall. This enzyme brings about clumping of the staphylococci when mixed with plasma by directly acting on fibrinogen. Lysis of the cell releases the enzyme. Unlike free coagulase, clumping factor does not need CRF for its action; till date only one type has been identified. Bound coagulase is not a virulence factor.Differences between coagulase and clumping factors are sum-marized in Table 23-4.Coagulase Clumping factor Produced extracellularly Present on the surface Detected by tube test Detected by slide test Heat labile Heat stable Eight serotypes One serotype Needs CRF Does not need CRF Is a virulence factor Is not a virulence factorTABLE 23-4Differentiating features of coagulase and clumping factors Chap-23.indd PMSection III Chapter 23STAPHYLOCOCCUS 177 The toxins are superantigens and act by producing large amounts of interleukins, IL-1 and IL-2. The enterotoxins are responsible for clinical conditions like staphylococcal food poisoning and pseudomembranous enterocolitis postantibiotic therapy. Exfoliative toxin: Exfoliative toxin is of two types: (a) toxin A (molecular weight of 30,000 Da) and (b) toxin B (molecular weight of 29,500 Da). Toxin A is heat stable, while toxin B is heat labile. The toxin is antigenic, and specific antibodies against the toxin are protective. The strains producing this toxin belong to bacteriophage group II. The toxin breaks intercellular bridges in the stratum gran-ulosum of epidermis and causes its separation from the underlying tissue, resulting in a blistering and exfoliating disease of the skin. Toxin in localized form causes bullous impetigo and in gen-eralized form causes staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) in children below 4 years of age. Leukocidins: Leukocidins include (a) alpha-lysin, (b) Panton-Valentine-leukocidin (PV-leukocidin), and (c) leukolysin. The alpha-lysin is the most important leukocidin. It causes marked necrosis of the skin and hemolysis by damaging the cell membrane, leading to release of low-molecular-weight substances from the damaged cells. PV-leukocidins are six in number, each consisting of two components. The molecular weight is around 32 kDa. These toxins cause death of human leukocytes and macrophages without causing any lysis. Leukolysin is thermostable and causes lysis of leukocytes and necrosis of tissues in vivo. Hemolysins: S. aureus produces four hemolysins: alpha gamma (/H9253), and delta (/H9254) hemolysins. Alpha-hemolysin is a protein with a molecular weight of 33 kDa. It has lethal effects on a wide variety of cell types and lyses erythrocytes of several animal species. Beta-hemolysin is a sphingomyelinase that is active on a variety of cells. It is a protein with a molecular weight of 35 kDa. It is a hot-cold hemolysin; i.e., its hemolytic proper-ties are increased by exposure of the RBCs to cold temperature. Delta-hemolysin is a protein with a molecular weight of 8 kDa. It acts primarily as a surfactant. Gamma-hemolysin actually consists of three proteins. The three delta-hemolysin proteins interact with one of the two PV-leukocidin proteins. Pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections S. aureus are pyogenic bacteria that cause localized lesions in contrast to streptococci that are spreading in nature. Staphylococci adhere to the damaged skin, mucosa, or tis-sue surfaces. At these sites, they evade defense mechanisms of the host, colonize, and cause tissue damage. They produce disease by: Multiplying in tissues, Liberating toxins, and Stimulating inflammation. Host immunity S. aureus infection does not cause any life-long immunity. It causes repeated infections in a susceptible host. Clinical Syndromes The diseases caused by S. aureus can be divided into two groups: (a) inflammatory and (b ) toxin-mediated staphylococcal diseases. Inflammatory staphylococcal diseases These include skin infections impetigo, wound infection, blepharitis, and postpartum breast infection. S. aureus is the most common cause of boils. The infection is acquired either by self-inoculation from a carrier site, such as the nose or through contact with another person harbor-ing the bacteria. Bacteremia and septicemia may occur from any localized lesion, especially wound infection or as a result of intrave-nous drug abuse. S. aureus is an important cause of acute bacterial endocardi-tis, of normal or prosthetic heart valves, which is associated with high mortality. S. aureus is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in chil-dren. The bacteria reach bone through blood stream or by direct implantation following trauma. S. aureus causes pneumonia in postoperative patients follow-ing viral respiratory infection, leading to empyema; it also leads to chronic sinusitis. S. aureus causes deep-seated abscesses in any organ after bacteremia. Toxin-mediated staphylococcal diseases These include (a) staphylococcal food poisoning, (b) staphy-lococcal toxic shock syndrome, and (c) staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.Staphylococcal food poisoning: Staphylococcal food poison-ing is caused by enterotoxin. The enterotoxin is a preformed toxin, already present in the contaminated food before consumption. Milk and milk products and animal products like fish and meat kept at room temperature after cooking are mainly incriminated. When kept at room temperature, the contaminating staphylo-cocci multiply and produce toxin adequate enough (as little as 25 /H9262 g of toxin B can lead to illness) to cause food poisoning. The toxin acts by stimulating the release of large amounts of interleukins IL-1 and IL-2. It is fairly heat resistant and so is not inactivated by brief cooking. Often a food handler, who either is a carrier of S. aureus (nose, skin) or is suffering from staphylococcal skin infection, Chap-23.indd 177 5/14/2012 5:54:39 PMSection III Chapter 23178 BACTERIOLOGY is the source of infection. The onset of symptoms is sudden, appearing within 2-6 hours of ingestion of food. It is a self- limiting condition characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdomi-nal cramps, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea.Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome: Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is caused by TSST. The toxin is a supe-rantigen, which causes STSS by stimulating the release of large amounts of interleukins IL-1 and IL-2 in the body. The STSS is an acute and potentially life-threatening con- dition similar to Gram-negative sepsis and septic shock. STSS is a multisystem disease characterized by fever, hypotension, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, mucosal hyperemia, and an ery-thematous rash followed by desquamation of the skin, particu-larly on palms and soles. This condition was first documented in 1980 in the United States among the menstruating women who used highly absor-bent vaginal tampons; the vaginal swab from these women showed a heavy growth of S. aureus. This condition can also occur in other individuals, who have a local site of staphylococ-cal infection on skin or mucosa or on any other extragenital site.Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome: Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by the exfoliative toxin, exfoliatin. The condition is seen commonly in infants and chil-dren. It is associated with extensive exfoliation of the skin, in which outer layer of the epidermis is separated from the under-lying tissue and is characterized by the appearance of extensive bullae. These bullae when ruptured may leave behind scalded, red, tender skin. The lesion typically starts periorificially or in skin folds. It usually resolves within 10 days' time. Pemphigus neonatorum and bullous impetigo are the milder forms, whereas Ritter's disease in the newborn and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the older persons are the severe forms of the SSSS. Complications of Staphylococcal Diseases Complications of staphylococcal diseases include bacterial pneumonia, septicemia, arthritis, meningitis, etc. These com-plications are frequently seen in persons with extreme of age, debilitated persons, and immunosuppressed hosts. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Staphylococcal infections are found throughout the world. Nearly one-third of the adult population is asymptomatic car-rier of staphylococci. Hospital infections caused by S. aureus are worldwide in distribution. Habitat Staphylococci are primary pathogens of humans and animals. They are present as commensals on skin, in the glands of the skin, and on mucous membranes. The cocci are commonly found in the intertriginous skin folds, perineum, axillae, and vagina. Approximately, 35-50% of normal adults carry S. aureus in the anterior nares, 10% in the perineum, and 5-10% in the vagina. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Human cases and carriers are the important reservoir of infection. Human cases of cutaneous and respiratory infections shed large numbers of staphylococci into the environment for a prolonged period of time. Staphylococci colonize the skin very early in life (in neonates on the umbilical stump). Staphylococci shed by the patients and carriers contaminate handkerchiefs, bed linens, blankets, and other inanimate fomites and persist in them for weeks. S. aureus found in the nose and sometimes on the skin, espe-cially in hospital staff and patients is the main source of infection in hospitals. Domestic animals, such as cows, can also be reservoirs of staphylococcal infection. Key Points Staphylococcal infections may be acquired through: Self-inoculation from nose or other sites in patients who harbor staphylococci (endogenous infection) or Direct contact with infected humans, carriers, and less fre-quently, animals (exogenous infection). Exogenous infection can also be acquired by close contact with infected fomi-tes or inhalation of air droplets in heavily contaminated environment. Hospital-acquired S. aureus infections: This is the most com- mon cause of hospital-acquired infections. Certain strains of S. aureus causing hospital infections are known as hospital strains. They exhibit certain properties, which are presented in Box 23-1. Bacteriophage typing Strains of staphylococci can be typed by bacteriophage typ-ing, which is useful in epidemiological studies (Fig. 23-3). Bacteriophage typing is based on the susceptibility of cocci to bacteriophages. This is carried out by pattern method, where a set of 23 standard typing phages of S. aureus is used to type staphylococcal isolates and distinguish them from one another by their patterns of susceptibility to lysis. In this method, the Certain strains of staphylococci are the common causes of postopera-tive wound infections and other infections in the hospital environment. These strains are known as \"hospital strains\". These hospital strains show following characteristics: 1. They are usually resistant to penicillin, methicillin, and other rou-tinely used antibio tics. 2. They belong to cer tain bacteriophage types. 3. Some of the strains (e.g., phage type 80/81) are known to cause hospit al inf ections throughout the world. Such strains are known as \"epidemic strains\".Box 23-1 Hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus Chap-23.indd 178 5/14/2012 5:54:40 PMSection III Chapter 23STAPHYLOCOCCUS 179 strain of S. aureus to be typed is inoculated on a nutrient agar plate to produce a lawn culture. After drying the plate, various phages at their routine test dilution (RTD) are applied over marked squares on plate. Such plates are then incubated over-night at 30\u00b0C and observed for the presence or absence of lysis of the colonies by the phages. The phage type of a strain is known by designation of the phages that lyse it. Thus, if a strain is lysed by phages 83A, 84, and 85, it is called phage type 83A/84/85. By this method, most of the strains of staphylococci can be classified and are divided into five lytic groups, while there are a few which cannot be classified and constitute the unclassified group (Table 23-5). The national reference centre for staphylococcal phage typ- ing in India is located in the Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. Other typing methods S. aureus has been classified into six biotypes (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Most human pathogenic strains belong to biotype A. Other typing methods include (a) plasmid profile, (b) DNA fingerprinting, (c) ribotyping, and (d) PCR-based analysis of genetic pleomorphism and (e) serotyping. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of staphylococcal infections is based on the demonstration of staphylococci, in appropriate clinical specimens, by microscopy and culture.FIG. 23-3. Bacteriophage typing of staphylococci. Specimen Condition Suppurative lesions and osteomyelitis Sputum Respiratory infections Blood Bacteremia Feces and vomitus Food poisoning Urine Urinary tract infections Nasal and perineal swab Suspected carriersTABLE 23-6Various specimens collected in staphylococcal infections Specimens Specimens to be collected for demonstration of staphylococci depend on the nature of lesion (Table 23-6). Microscopy Demonstration of Gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters and pus cells in the Gram-stained smears of pus (Fig. 23-4, Color Photo 14), wound exudate, etc. are the characteristic features of pyogenic infection caused by S. aureus. It is noteworthy that microscopy: Alone is not adequate to differentiate various species of staphylococci or micrococci from one another. Is also of no value for sputum and other specimens where mixed bacterial flora is present. Culture The identification of staphylococci is confirmed by culture and other identification tests comprising a range of biochemical and enzymatic tests followed by antibiotic sensitivity. The spec-imens are inoculated onto nutrient agar and blood agar On nutrient smooth, convex, and glistening colonies showing golden-yellow pigments can be observed. On blood agar, the colonies show a zone of beta-hemolysis, which is not shown by any other species of staphylococci. Specimens from heavily contaminated sources, such as vom- itus and feces, are inoculated on selective media (e.g., manni-tol salt agar or salt milk agar). These media inhibit growth of Gram-negative bacteria but allow the growth of staphylococci and certain other Gram-positive cocci. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of S. aureus are summarized in Box 23-2. Coagulase test Coagulase test is an important test carried out to detect S. aureus. The test is done in two ways: tube coagulase test and slide coagulase test.Group Phage I 29, 52, 52A, 79, 80 II 3A, 3C, 55, 71 III 6, 42E, 47, 53, 54, 75, 77, 83A, 84, 85 IV \u2014 V 94, 96 Not allocated 81, 95TABLE 23-5Phage typing of human isolates of Staphylococcus aureus Chap-23.indd 5:54:40 test: coagulase test is carried out to detect free coagulase. In this test, 0.1 mL of an overnight broth culture is mixed with 0.5 mL of a 1:10 dilution of human or rabbit plasma. The plasma-broth culture mixture is incu-bated in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 3-6 hours. In a positive test, the plasma is coagulated and does not flow (Fig. 23-5, Color Photo 13). Human or rabbit plasma, which is rich in CRF, is used in the test. The plasma is collected in vials containing anticoagu-lants, such as oxalate, heparin, or EDTA. Citrated plasma is not used because if the specimen is con-taminated with Gram-negative bacilli, the latter may utilize the citrate and produce false positive reaction. Slide coagulase test: Slide coagulase test detects the bound coagulase or the clumping factor. The test is performed by mix-ing a dense suspension of the staphylococci with a loopful of undiluted rabbit plasma on a slide. In a positive test, clumping takes place within 10 seconds. Phosphatase test The production of phosphatase can be demonstrated by culturing a mixed specimen on phenolphthalein phosphate agar and exposing the colonies to ammonium vapors. S. aureuscolonies turn bright pink due to the release of phenolphthalein. Novobiocin sensitivity Novobiocin sensitivity is a simple disk diffusion test to differ-entiate S. aureus from other staphylococci. This test is carried out by using a 5- /H9262g novobiocin disk on an overnight culture of staphylococci on Mueller-Hinton agar. Novobiocin sensitivity is shown by an inhibition zone of /H1135016 mm. S. aureus is novobio-cin sensitive, while S. saprophyticus is novobiocin resistant. Polymyxin B resistance Polymyxin B sensitivity is again a simple disk diffusion test to differentiate S. aureus from other staphylococci. This is carried out by using a 300-U polymyxin B disk on an overnight culture of staphylococci on Mueller-Hinton agar. Polymyxin resistance is shown by an inhibition zone of /H1102110 mm. S. aureus is usually polymyxin resistant. Treatment Skin and soft tissue infections are treated best with local wound care with or without topical antibiotics (e.g., neomycin). Spontaneous or surgical drainage of pus and debride-ment of necrotic tissue is an effective mode for treatment of staphylococcal abscess. Systemic antibiotics are necessary for deep-seated and systemic infections. Key Points Benzyl penicillin is the drug of choice for penicillin- sensitive strains of S. aureus. Erythromycin, vancomycin, or first-generation cephalospo-rins are recommended for patients with allergy to penicillin. Penicillin resistance in staphylococci Penicillin resistance in the bacteria is increasingly recognized since 1945. Nearly 80% or more strains of S. aureus are resistant to penicillin. It is of three types: 1. S. aureus are Gram-positive cocci arranged in irregular grape-lik e clusters. 2. On nutrient agar, S. aureus colonies produce characteristic golden-yello w colonies. 3. On blood agar, S. aureus produces a clear zone of hemolysis (beta-hemoly sis). 4. S. aureus are coagulase positiv e. All coagulase-producing st aphylo- cocci are, by definition, S. aureus. 5. S. aureus are phosphat ase positiv e, DNAase positive, and mannitol positive. 6. S. aureus are no v obiocin and polymyxin B sensitive.Box 23-2 Identifying 23STAPHYLOCOCCUS 181 1. Plasmid-mediated resistance: This type of resistance may be due to the production of enzyme penicillinase (beta- lactamase), which is plasmid mediated. penicillin by splitting the beta-lactam rings. Staphylococci produce four types of penicillinases (A, B, C, and D). Penicillinase plasmids are transmitted to the staphylococci by both transduction and con-jugation. The plasmids also carry markers of resistance to heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, and bismuth as well as to other antibiotics, such as erythromycin and fusidic acid.2. Chromosomal-mediated resistance: This type of resis- tance has also been documented. Reduction in the affinity of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs; present on the cell wall of the staphylococci) to the beta-lactam antibiotics also con-tributes to the resistance of the bacteria to penicillins and other beta-lactam antibiotics.3. Tolerance to penicillin: Staphylococci developing tolerance to penicillin are only inhibited but not killed. Penicillin-resistant strains can be treated with beta- (MRSA) denotes resistance of S. aureus to penicillin, as well as to all other beta-lactam anti-biotics including the third-generation cephalosporins and car-bapenems. Resistance to methicillin is due to the production of a novel PBP, designated as PBP 2a. PBPs are the targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. Infections caused by MRSA are being increasingly reported worldwide since 1980. The infection is also being increasingly reported now, from different hospitals. MRSA usually colo-nizes the broken skin and can cause a wide range of local and systemic staphylococcal infections. Hospital staffs harboring MRSA are the chief source of infection for the patients. These strains can cause a wide range of infections including bacteremia, endocarditis, and pneu-monia. These strains are increasingly recognized as important agents of hospital-acquired infection in hospitalized patients undergoing prosthetic heart valve surgery. MRSA strains can be treated with glycopeptide antibiot- ics, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin in serious systemic infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and endocarditis. MRSA are sensitive to one or more of the second-line drugs, which include and fusidic acid are not used simply because of the possibility of emergence of resistance. Proper hand-washing and use of topical agents, such as mupirocin and chlorhexidine on skin and nose to eradicate the agents are effective to prevent and control nosocomial infections caused by MRSA. Prevention and Control There is no effective immunization with toxoids or bacterial vaccines against staphylococcal infection. Cleanliness, frequent hand-washing, and aseptic management of lesions help in the control of S. aureus infection . Treating with nasal creams contain- ing neomycin or bacitracin prevents recurrent infections in cases of nasal carriers of S. aureus. Topical application of antimicrobial agents prevents dissemination of infection from the abscesses. Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) are the normal flora of the skin. CONS are opportunistic bacteria. They cause infec-tions in debilitated or immunocompromised patients and in patients fitted with urinary catheters, cardiac valves, pacemak-ers, and artificial joints. They form white nonpigmented colonies, morphologically similar to those of S. aureus. They are differentiated from S. aureus by their failure to coag-ulate the plasma due to the absence of the enzyme coagulase. CONS of medical importance include (a) S. epidermidis, (b) S. saprophyticus, (c) S. haemolyticus, (d ) (h) Staphylococcus simulans. Staphylococcus epidermidis S. epidermidis forms white colonies on blood agar. It is catalase positive, coagulase negative, and does not ferment mannitol. It tolerates salt, survives drying, and is highly antibiotic resistant. It is a normal skin commensal. Carriage rate is as high as 100%. This bacterium is transmitted by self-inoculation or by contact with infected patients and hospital personnel. Ability to produce slime is an important virulence factor of the bacterium. S. epidermidis causes infection by adhering itself to the surface of the intravenous plastic catheters and pros-thetic devices. The adherence is believed to be facilitated by polysaccharide glycocalyx known as slime, produced in large quantities by the bacteria. Slime also inhibits the action of lym-phocytes and neutrophils. S. epidermidis is an important agent of hospital-acquired infection. It causes: infection in compromised hosts, such as neutropenic patients, particularly in association with intravenous cath-eters and other prosthetic devices, such as heart valves. endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valves, intravenous catheter infections, CSF shunt infections, catheter-associated peritonitis and endocarditis. sepsis in neonates, osteomyelitis, wound infections, vascular graft infections, and mediastinitis. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for treatment of infection caused by S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus saprophyticus S. saprophyticus forms white colonies on blood agar. It is catalase positive, coagulase negative, and does not ferment mannitol. It normally inhabits the skin and genital mucosa. The bacterium causes: infection by endogenous spread in colonized women. It adheres to the epithelial cells lin-ing the urogenital tract. It causes catheter-associated urinary tract infections, elderly men, and rarely, sepsis and endocarditis. Urinary tract infection caused by S. saprophyticus can be treated with quinolones (such as norfloxacin) or with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus are distinguished from each other by their reaction to antibiotic novobiocin\u2014S. epidermidisis sensitive, while S. saprophyticus is resistant. The differences between S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus are summa- rized in Acid from mannitol /H11001/H11002 aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus A group of 25 students of 11-12 years of age studying in a higher secondary school in Haripur were admitted to a hospital with complaints of severe vomiting and diarrhea within 3 hours of consuming the food prepared in their school. History revealed that a new cook appointed a few days back in the school prepared the food. All the students consumed the same food. Children were treated and were discharged after observing them overnight in the hospital. What is the possible cause of this food poisoning? What is the possible reservoir for this organism that was responsible for this outbreak? What are the tests you will perform to establish the etiological diagnosis of the condition? What steps you will take to prevent this infection?CASE STUDYOther Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci There are many other coagulase-negative staphylococci that have been reported recently to cause human infections. These include the following: 1. S. haemolyticus causes bacteremia, endocarditis, urinary tract and saccharolyticus causes endocarditis. 3. S. hominis causes bacteremia in cancer patients. 4. S. schleiferi causes wound inf ections, bacteremia, and endocarditis, peritonitis, osteomy eli- tis, and breast abscesses. 6. S. causes septicemia, osteom yelitis, and septic arthritis. Micrococcus Micrococci in comparison to staphylococci are larger and measure up to 2 /H9262m in diameter. In smears, they appear as Gram-positive cocci arranged in tetrads. On culture, they pro-duce colonies with yellow, pink, or red pigments. It is doubtful that they are human pathogens. Planococcus They are Gram-positive cocci most commonly found in seawater, prawns, and shrimp. They are distinguished from other Gram-positive cocci by their ability to grow in a higher salt concentra-tion of 12% sodium chloride. They are nonpathogenic to humans. Stomatococcus They are capsulated Gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs or clusters. On culture, they produce white and mucoid colonies. It is doubtful that they are human pathogens. Chap-23.indd 182 5/14/2012 5:54:41 PMStreptococcus facultatively anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, arranged in pairs, or chains. The enterococci are facultative anaerobes. They require complex nutrients for their growth. Streptococci and enterococci causing human infec-tions are summarized in Table 24-1. Streptococcus Streptococci are part of the normal flora in humans and animals. They are nonmotile, nonsporing, spherical or ovoid cocci, and have hyaluronic acid capsules. They are catalase negative by which they are distinguished from staphylococci. They are relatively fastidious bacteria requiring enriched medium, such as blood agar for their growth. Classification The streptococci based on their oxygen requirement are classi-fied into aerobes and obligate anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes are designated as peptostreptococci, which will be described in detail in Chapter 30. The aerobes and facultative anaerobes are further classified as follows: Classification based on hemolysis in blood agar The aerobes and facultative anaerobes are further classi-fied on the basis of their hemolytic properties on blood agar. Brown (1919) classified these aerobic streptococci into three groups on the basis of their growth in 5% horse blood agar.Alpha-hemolytic streptococci: These cocci produce colo-nies surrounded by a narrow zone (greenish zone) of hemoly-sis with persistence of some partially lysed RBCs. The greenish discoloration is due to the formation of a reduced product of hemoglobin. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci are known as viridans streptococci. These are found as commensals in the upper respiratory tract of humans, and these may cause oppor-tunistic infections. Streptococcus salivarius is an important opportunistic pathogen belonging to this group (Streptococcus pneumoniae also belongs to alpha-hemolytic group).Beta-hemolytic streptococci: These well- defined, clear, colorless zone of hemolysis (2-4 mm wide) around the colonies. RBCs in the zone of hemolysis are completely lysed. This lysis is due to the liberation of enzymes streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). The term hemolytic streptococci is applicable only to beta-hemolytic streptococci. Most of the pathogenic streptococci belong to this group, and among them Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important one.Gamma-hemolytic streptococci: These streptococci do not produce any hemolysis or discoloration on blood agar. These ) based on antigenic structure Lancefield classification is a serological classification of the beta-hemolytic streptococci. acute in pregnant women; osteomyelitis, arthritis, peritonitis, and skin infections in nonpregnant infection of the bile duct, and 3:07:51 PMSection BACTERIOLOGY based on the detection of group-specific carbohydrate antigen (C antigen) on the cell wall of the streptococci. The beta-hemolytic streptococci are classified into 21 serological groups known as Lancefield groups, desig-nated from A to W (with exception of I and J). The major- ity of hemolytic streptococci that cause human infections belong to group A. Group A streptococci are also known as S. pyogenes , while group B streptococci are known as Strepto- coccus agalactiae. Based on the M, T, and R protein antigens present on the cell surface, S. pyogenes have been further classified into 80 sero-types. This classification is known as Griffith typing. M protein is the most important type-specific antigen. This serotyping is important for epidemiological studies. Streptococcus pyogenes S. pyogenes is the species classified under group A streptococci. It is the most important human pathogen causing: 1. Pyogenic infections, such as bacterial pharyngitis and cellulitis. 2. Toxin-mediated diseases, such as scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome. 3. Immunologic diseases, such as acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) and rheumatic f ever. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology S. pyogenes shows following features: They are Gram-positive cocci measuring 0.6-1.0 /H9262 m in diameter and are arranged in long chains. Streptococci are nonmotile and nonsporing. Streptococci divide in one plane and thus occur in pairs or in chains of vary-ing lengths, especially in liquid media and clinical specimens. They are motile and nonsporing. Some strains of S. pyogenes and some strains of group C streptococci produce capsule during the first 2-4 hours of growth. The capsule is composed of hyaluronic acid containing repeating molecules of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. It is chemically similar to that of host connective tissue and is therefore nonantigenic. Capsu-lated strains produce mucoid colonies on the blood agar (Fig. 24-1). Culture S. pyogenes is an aerobe and facultative anaerobe. It grows at 37\u00b0C and at a pH of 7.2-7.4 on enriched medium, such as blood agar. 1. Blood agar: S. py ogenes produces small white to gray colo- nies, measuring 0.5-1 mm in diameter with a clear zone of beta-hemolysis (Fig. 24-2, Color Photo 15). Presence of 10% CO 2 enhances the growth and hemolysis of colonies. The virulent strains on fresh isolation produce matt colo-nies, while avirulent strains produce glossy colonies. Colo-nies that produce large amounts of hyaluronic acid appear mucoid on the culture plate. 2. Selective media: Cryst al violet blood agar is a selective medium for culture of S. pyogenes. Addition of 0.0001% crys- tal violet to blood agar makes the medium highly selective for S. pyogenes. This inhibits all other Gram-positive cocci while allowing selective growth of S. pyogenes. PNF medium (horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulfate, neomy-cin sulfate, and fusidic acid) is another selective medium used for isolation of S. pyogenes. 3. Transport medium: Pikes transpor t medium containing (1:1,000,000) crystal violet and (1:16,000) sodium azide is a frequently used transport medium for transporting throat swab for culture of S. pyogenes. FIG. 24-2. Blood agar plate showing beta-hemolysis surrounding the colonies of 24-1. Antigenic of Cytoplasm S. py ogenes produces granular turbidity with powdery deposit when grown in the liquid media, such as serum or glucose broth. Biochemical reactions S. pyogenes shows following biochemical reactions: The bacteria are catalase negative; by this property, they are distinguished from staphylococci. They ferment many sugars, producing acid but no gas; how-evr, these are of little diagnostic value in the identification of cocci. They do not ferment ribose They are not soluble in bile. They cause hydrolysis of pyrrolidonyl naphthylamide (PYR). Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Streptococci are killed by heating at 54\u00b0C for 30 minutes and by usual strengths of disinfectants. They are sensitive to bacitracin. Sensitivity to bacitracin is an important diagnostic feature by which S. pyogenes can be differentiated from other hemolytic streptococci. They are resistant to crystal violet. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of S. pyogenes consists of the following compo-nents (Fig. 24-1): Group-specific carbohydrate The cell wall contains a group-specific polysaccharide that forms approximately 10% of the dry weight of the cell. It is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and rhamnose. It is nontoxic and hapten in rabbits. On the basis of group-specific carbo-hydrate (C) antigen, S. pyogenes strains have been divided into 21 groups (A-W) except I and J by Lancefield, hence are known as Lancefield groups. The \"C\" antigen can be extracted by the following methods: Acid extraction with hydrochloric acid (Lancefield extraction (Maxted's method ). After the extraction, the carbohydrate component is treated with type-specific antiserum by a precipitation reaction or by immunofluorescence for grouping of the isolates of S. pyogenes. Type-specific proteins The cell wall of S. pyogenes has three major proteins, M, T, and R proteins. These proteins are useful for serologic typing (Griffith typing) of S. pyogenes.M protein: M protein is the most important protein. It is acid- and heat-stable and trypsin-sensitive. It is the chief viru-lence factor of the cocci. It inhibits phagocytosis and facilitates the attachment of cocci to epithelial cells. M protein, a complex alpha-helix, consists of carboxyl terminus and an amino termi-nus. The carboxyl terminus is bound to the cytoplasmic mem-brane and is a highly conserved structure. The amino terminus is present through the cell wall to the cell surface and is highly variable. This variable component is responsible for antigenic differences in the M protein and based on that S. pyogenes is divided into more than 80 (l-60) serotypes. M proteins are fur-ther subdivided into class I and class II protein molecules: Antibodies develop against the exposed constant (C) region of the class I M proteins and are responsible for the patho-genesis of rheumatic fever. In contrast, antibodies do not develop against class II M proteins. T proteins: These are trypsin-resistant (T) proteins and are acid and heat labile. T typing of strains of S. pyogenes is useful in the epidemiological surveillance of the infection caused by cocci.R proteins: These are pepsin sensitive but trypsin resistant. These proteins are not important for typing the strains. Other cell surface components Peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and F proteins are other com-ponents of the cell wall of S. pyogenes. Peptidoglycan confers rigidity to the cell wall. It is also responsible for producing fever, dermal and cardiac necrosis in animals, and lysis of erythrocytes. Pathogenesis and Immunity Streptococci have more than 20 soluble antigens, enzymes, and toxins that contribute in the pathogenesis of various stages of streptococcal diseases. Virulence factors Streptococci produce a wide range of virulence factors respon-sible for the disease, which include the following (Table 24-2): (a) Cell wall associated proteins and polymers (b) Enzymes (c) Toxins Cell wall associated proteins and polymers These include capsule, teichoic acid, M protein, and F protein that contribute to pathogenesis of diseases in various ways as mentioned in Table 24-2.Capsule: The cell wall of the Streptococcus is surrounded by a capsule. The capsule is nonantigenic and weakly antiphagocytic. It acts like a barrier between the complement proteins bound to the bacteria and the phagocytic cells, thereby preventing phagocytosis of the bacteria. Capsulated strains that are rich in M proteins are highly pathogenic. Chap-24.indd 185 5/14/2012 3:07:53 PMSection III Chapter M protein, and F protein: Lipoteichoic acid and F proteins mediate the binding of the cocci with fibronectin present on the host cell surface. M protein is an adhesin and antiphagocytic, which inactivates C3b\u2014an important complement factor responsible for phagocytosis. Enzymes Streptokinase: This enzyme is produced by S. pyogenes as well as by group C and G streptococci. Two types of streptokinase have been described\u2014streptokinase A and B. Streptokinase activates plasminogen to form plasmin, which breaks down the fibrin barrier around the infected site, thereby facilitating the spread of the infection. This thrombolytic property is made good use of in medical management of myocardial infarction. Antibodies appear against streptokinase (A and B) during the course of infection and are diagnostic.Deoxyribonucleases: Four types of deoxyribonucleases have been described\u2014deoxyribonucleases A, B, C, and D. Most strains of S. pyogenes produce these enzymes. The enzyme depolymerizes free DNA present in the pus, thereby reduces viscosity of pus and helps in spread of the infection. The enzymes are antigenic, and the demonstration of antideoxyribonuclease B antibody in serum is diagnostic of S. pyogenes infections, particularly of skin infections.Hyaluronidase: The enzyme is produced by S. pyogenes as well as by other groups like B, C, G streptococci, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus anginosus, and S. hyaluronic acid present in host connective tissue, thereby facilitating spread of the bacteria through tissues. The enzyme is antigenic.Serum opacity factor: This is a lipoproteinase produced by some M types of S. pyogenes. This enzyme produces opacity when applied to agar gel containing swine or horse serum, hence is known as serum opacity factor (SOP). SOP is antigenic.Other Spes B, and Spes C. These toxins are antigenic, and their production is regulated by a temperate phage in their genome. These toxins act as superantigen and are responsible for scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Dick test: The susceptibility of a person to these toxins is determined by performing a skin test known as Dick test. In this test, 0.2 mL of the diluted toxin is injected intradermally. In a positive test, a localized erythematous reaction, around 1 cm in diameter, develops within 12-24 hours. A positive test indicates absence of antibodies against the toxin and shows susceptibility to the toxin and thus to scarlet fever. No reaction takes place in a negative test, which indicates the presence of specific antibodies against erythrogenic toxin in the serum.Schultz Charlton test: Intradermal injection of antitoxin in a patient with scarlet fever causes local blanching of the rash. This is due to neutralization of erythrogenic toxin. This test is known as Schultz Charlton test.Virulence factors Biological functions Cell wall associated polymers and proteinsCapsule Prevents phagocytosis Teichoic acid Binds to epithelial cells M protein Adhesin and antiphagocytic; inactivates C3b\u2014an important complement factor responsible for phagocytosis.

It causes beta-hemolysis only when colonies are grown under the surface of blood agar plate. It is antigenic, and antibodies (ASLO) against it develop in group A streptococcal infection. Demonstration of ASLO antibodies is important for the determination of a recent group A streptococcal infection and also the late complications of streptococcal infections after the organisms have been eliminated from the host. The SLO cross-reacts with similar hemolysins produced by streptococci of groups C and G, pneumolysins of S. pneumoniae, of Clostridium is a serum-soluble (hence named as S) and oxygen-stable protein. It is a small polypeptide of 20,000 Da and is nonantigenic. Hence, no antibodies against this toxin are demonstrated in serum. This toxin: Is responsible for hemolysis around the colonies grown on surface of the blood agar. Inhibits chemotaxis and is antiphagocytic. Pyrogenic exotoxins: There are two types of exotoxins\u2014exotoxin A and B. Pyrogenic exotoxin A is similar to that of staphylococ-cal toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST). It has the same mode of action as staphylococcal TSST. It acts by releas-ing large amounts of cytokines from helper T cells and macrophages. Pyrogenic exotoxin B is a protease that rapidly destroys tissues and is produced in large amount by S. pyogenes. Pathogenesis of streptococcal infections S. pyogenes produces suppurative as as nonsuppurative streptococcal diseases by following mechanisms: 1. Adherence: Adherence of S. p yogenes to surface of host cells is the first stage in pathogenesis of the disease. The cocci adhere to the epithelium of the pharynx with the help of pili, lipoteichoic acid, F proteins, and M proteins. Initially, adherence is mediated by a weak binding between lipoteichoic acid and fatty acid of the cocci with fibronec-tin of epithelial cells of the host. Subsequently, a strong binding is established by M protein, F protein, and other adhesins of the cocci. 2. Invasion by the cocci: S. p yogenes invades into epithelial cells mediated by M protein, F protein, and other antigens of the cocci. Invasion of the cocci is suggested to be respon-sible for the persistence of infection, such as streptococ-cal pharyngitis, as well as for invasion into deep tissues. Hyaluronic acid capsule, M protein, and C5a peptidase of S. pyogenes are antiphagocytic. These factors prevent opso-nization and phagocytosis of bacteria in many ways. The capsule prevents phagocytosis of the bacteria by acting as a barrier between bacteria and cell. The M protein inactivates C3b, an important comple-ment factor that mediates phagocytosis of bacteria. The M protein also binds to the fibrinogen and blocks the activation of complement by alternate pathway, thereby reducing the amount of C3b production. The C5a peptidase enzymes: S. py ogenes then pro- duces a wide variety of toxins and enzymes that contribute to pathogenesis of many streptococcal diseases. Host immunity Acquired immunity to streptococcal infection is based on the development of specific antibodies against the antiphagocytic epitopes of M protein. The acquired immunity against a particu-lar M type of streptococci lasts longer in untreated persons than in treated persons. Although such antibodies protect from infection against a homologous M protein type, they confer no immunity against other M serotypes. S. pyogenes is a highly communicable bacterium. It can cause disease in people of all ages who do not have type-specific immunity against the specific serotype. Clinical Syndromes S. pyogenes produces a variety of clinical manifestations. These infections can be classified broadly as: (a) suppurative strepto-coccal diseases, (b) toxin-mediated disease, and Suppurative streptococcal diseases Respiratory infections Pharyngitis: S. pyogenes is the most common bacterium causing pharyngitis or sore throat. Pharyngitis is characterized by inflammation of pharyngeal mucosa with exudate formation, tender enlarged cervical lymph nodes, fever, and leukocytosis. The condition is commonly seen in children and it spreads by droplet nuclei. The incubation period is 1-4 days. Uncomplicated pharyngitis resolves within 3-5 days. Skin and soft tissue infections Pyoderma: Pyoderma or impetigo is a localized infection of the skin, primarily affecting face, arms, legs, and other exposed parts of the body. The infection is acquired by direct contact with an infected person or fomites. The condition is caused by a limited number of serotypes (49, 53-55, 59-61, etc.) of S. pyogenes. The condition is seen mainly in young children. In tropics, impetigo is one of the important causes of acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) in children. is an acute and diffused infection of the skin, affecting the superficial lymphatics. It is characterized by red, swollen, and indurated skin with well-marked and raised borders. The affected skin is clearly demarcated from the surrounding healthy area. Commonly, face and legs are affected. Erysipelas occurs most commonly in young children or in older adults.Cellulitis: Cellulitis is the infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by local inflammation like edema, erythema, tenderness, fever, headache, malaise, and other systemic manifestations. It is spreading in nature, often without any apparent focus of infection. The entry of the pathogen may be at a location distant to the lesion.Necrotizing fasciitis: Necrotizing fasciitis occurs as a rapidly spreading streptococcal infection of superficial and deep fascia. The infection is caused by certain M strains of S. pyogenes (M types 1 and 3), which produce pyrogenic exotoxins. These strains are also called as \"flesh-eating strains\" due to the extensive destruction of muscle and fascia caused by them. The condition is also associated with a toxic shock-like syndrome, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multisystem failure. Toxin-mediated diseases Scarlet fever: Scarlet fever is a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis caused by certain strains of S. pyogenes producing pyrogenic exotoxins. It manifests as fever, pharyngitis, and by a characteristic rash. The rash is followed by desquamation. However, with the use of penicillin and other antibiotics, the suppurative complications of pharyngitis including scarlet fever have become rare.Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is caused by certain strains of S. pyogenes (M serotypes 1 or 3) that have prominent hyaluronic acid capsule. This is a condition similar to staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The condition manifests initially as pain at the site of inflammation and nonspecific systemic complaints, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and chills. The condition progresses subsequently to multiorgan failure and shock. S. pyogenes is always isolated from the blood in toxic shock syndrome. The condition occurs in people of all ages. However, patients with HIV infection, varicella-zoster infection, diabetes, heart diseases, and intravenous drug and alcohol abusers are at high risk for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Other suppurative streptococcal diseases Other pyogenic infections caused by S. pyogenes include lym-phangitis, puerperal sepsis, abscesses of the internal organs (liver, lungs, kidneys, brain, etc.), and bacteremia. Nonsuppurative streptococcal diseases Acute glomerulonephritis: AGN is a nonsuppurative compli-cation of S. pyogenes infection. The onset of infection typically occurs 2-3 weeks following skin infection or pharyngitis caused by certain pharyngeal (M types 1, 12) and pyodermal strains (M types 49, 53-55, 59-61) of S. pyogenes. M protein type 49 skin infection is most frequently implicated. The disease occurs as a result of deposition of antigen-antibody complexes on the glo-merular basement membrane, initiating inflammation. This leads to the manifestation of disease with hypertension, gen-eralized edema, hematuria, and proteinuria. It has an excellent prognosis, and most young patients usually recover completely.Rheumatic fever: Rheumatic fever is an immunologically mediated disease, which affects the heart, joints, skin, and brain. It has a latent period of 2-4 weeks. It is characterized by fever, migrating polyarthritis, and carditis, and is frequently associated with subcutaneous nodules. Damage to heart valves may occur during the course of infection. Key Points Rheumatic fever occurs mainly due to antigenic cross-reaction between streptococcal proteins and the connective tissue antigens of the heart and joints. It is an autoimmune disease exacerbated by recurrence of streptococcal infection. The diagnosis of this condition is mainly clinical, supple-mented by relevant laboratory investigations. If streptococcal infections are treated within 8 days after onset, rheumatic fever is usually prevented. The comparison of AGN and rheumatic fever is presented in Table 24-3. Epidemiology Geographical distribution S. pyogenes infections are worldwide in distribution. Prevalence of streptococcal pyoderma is higher in tropics with no seasonal variation, whereas it is more common in winter months in temperate countries. Rheumatic fever is most frequently observed in children aged 5-15 years, the age group most susceptible to S. pyogenes infections. The attack rate of rheumatic fever following upper respiratory tract infection is approximately 3% for persons with untreated or inadequately treated infections. Habitat Streptococci are normal flora of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, skin, fingernails, perianal region, intestine, and upper respira-tory tract of humans. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Infected human cases are the reservoirs of infection. Respiratory and salivary secretions in the form of droplets and contami-nated fomites are the sources of S. pyogenes infection. Streptococcal carrier rate as high as 20-40% has been reported. However, these carriers with chronic asymptomatic pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal colonization are not usually Chap-24.indd 188 5/14/2012 3:07:53 PMSection III Chapter 24STREPTOCOCCUS AND ENTEROCOCCUS 189 at risk of spreading disease, as they mostly inhabit avirulent organisms. Person-to-person transmission is the main route of trans-mission. The infection is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets. The infection is also trans-mitted through breaks in the skin by direct contact with infected patient, fomites, or arthropod vectors. Children with untreated acute infections spread organisms by their salivary droplet and nasal discharge. Occasional food-borne and waterborne outbreaks have also been documented. Overcrowding (crowded homes and class rooms) is an impor-tant factor in transmission of S. pyogenes infection. Both impe-tigo and pharyngitis are more likely to occur in children living in crowded homes and under poor hygienic conditions. Bacteriocin and phage typing of streptococci are employed in research and epidemiologic studies. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens The nature of specimens to be collected for bacteriologi-cal investigations of S. pyogenes infections depends upon the disease manifestations. The frequently used specimens include: Throat swab, nasal swabs, high vaginal swabs (puerperal sepsis), pus or pus swabs, pharyngeal secretions, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, joint or abscess fluid. A frozen section biopsy obtained in the operating room may be used in cases of suspected necrotizing fasciitis. Microscopy Gram staining of pus or exudate is a rapid and presumptive diagnostic procedure for S. pyogenes infection of skin and soft tissues.

Gram-stained pus smear showing streptococci in chains (X1000). and chains (Fig. 24-3) in association with leukocytes is sug-gestive of streptococcal infection. This is because S. pyogenes are not found as normal flora on the skin surface. However, demonstration of streptococci in respiratory specimens from a patient with pharyngitis by Gram staining is of no value, because the streptococci are found as part of the normal flora in the oropharynx. Culture Throat swab culture is the most specific method for diag-nosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Ideally, the throat swab specimen should be collected from tonsils and posterior part of the oropharynx because more number of bacteria are present at this site than in the anterior part of mouth. After collection of the specimen, they are plated immediately on the blood agar plate, and in case of delay they are sent to the laboratory in Pikes transport medium. In laboratory, the specimens are inoculated on a 5% sheep blood agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C aerobically in the presence of for Chap-24.indd 189 5/14/2012 3:07:53 PMSection III Chapter 24190 BACTERIOLOGY Identification of bacteria Culture of the swabs on blood agar shows a clear zone of beta-hemolysis (Fig. 24-2) surrounding the small translucent to opaque colonies. The identifying features of S. pyogenes are summarized in Box 24-1.Bacitracin sensitivity test: S. pyogenes can be distinguished from other streptococcal groups by their sensitivity to bacitracin. In this method, a filter paper disc containing 0.04 U of bacitra-cin is applied on the surface of an inoculated blood agar and is incubated overnight. Any zone of inhibition around the colonies confirms the presence of S. pyogenes (Fig. 24-4, Color Photo 16). Bacitracin test is simple to perform and is useful for presump-tive identification of S. pyogenes. It is positive in more than 95% of S. pyogenes strains and negative in nongroup A streptococci. L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide test: This is a test per- formed to differentiate S. pyogenes from other to produce a substance called beta-naphthylamine. This substance can be detected in the presence of p-dimethylamino cinnamaldehyde by formation of a characteristic red color after applying a disc containing p-dimethylamino cinnamaldehyde on an inoculated agar plate followed by overnight incubation. This makes the presumptive identification of a strain as group A streptococci. FIG. 24-4. Bacitracin sensitivity of Strep tococcus pyogenes. 1. Gram-positive cocci arranged in short chains or pairs. 2. On blood agar, produces a clear zone of hemolysis ( beta-hemoly sis). 3. Positive for bacitracin susceptibility test. 4. Positive for L-pyrrolidonyl-alpha-naphthylamide (PYR) test. 5. Positive for group-specific C antigen by direct antigen detection tests.Box 24-1 Identifying features of Streptococcus pyogenesDirect antigen detection test: Detection of group-specific carbohydrate antigen A directly in the throat swabs by direct fluorescent antibody test is a very rapid and specific method. The result for this test is obtained within 4 hours. The test is as specific as culture but is less sensitive. Serodiagnosis Serological tests are of value in the diagnosis of AGN and rheu-matic fever. These tests detect high level of antibodies produced against many streptococcal antigens. The tests detecting anti-bodies against SLO (anti-SLO, or ASO antibodies) are most frequently used for confirming rheumatic fever and AGN. The ASO antibodies appear in serum 3-4 weeks after initial infection by S. pyogenes. A titer of more than 200 indicates streptococcal infections. Higher antibody titers are found in acute rheumatic fever, whereas they are not raised in patients with glomerulone-phritis and streptococcal pyoderma. Antibodies against other streptococcal DNAase (anti-DNase B anti-bodies), hyaluronidase (anti-hyaluronidase antibodies), and streptokinase (anti-streptokinase antibodies) are also demon-strated in S. pyogenes infections. The demonstration of antibod-ies against these antigens may prove useful in the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis and pyoderma. Treatment Treatment of S. pyogenes infections by antibiotics varies depend-ing upon the clinical conditions. Penicillin is highly effective against S. pyogenes. As of now, no penicillin-resistant strains of S. pyogenes have been documented in clinical practice. Penicillin, therefore, remains the drug of choice, except in penicillin-aller-gic individuals (with pharyngeal infections) and in complicated or invasive diseases.Failures of penicillin therapy: In uncomplicated cases, peni- cillin is given orally in a dosage of 250-500 mg twice daily for at least 10 days. Noncompliance is the most common reason for the failure to respond to therapy. The drug is often discontinued before the 10-day course is completed, because children usually appear to have recovered in 3-4 days. And the presence of beta- lactamase-producing flora (particularly organisms, such as mouth anaerobes), which could inactivate penicillin, has also been proposed. However, this theory is yet to be proved conclusively. Most of the failures of penicillin therapy have been thought to occur in patients where streptococcal pharyngitis has not been well defined and some of these patients may in fact be streptococcal carriers who actually had viral pharyngitis. Erythromycin and clindamycin are given to patients aller-gic to penicillins. Recently, strains resistant to erythromycin have been reported. Sulfonamides and tetracycline are not used for streptococcal infections. Prevention and Control Chemoprophylaxis is most important in prevention of AGN or rheumatic fever. Chap-24.indd 190 chemoprophylaxis using penicillins to prevent streptococcal infection is recommended for patients with a his-tory of acute rheumatic fever (up to age 21 years) or rheumatic heart disease (lifelong). Antibiotic prophylaxis prevents strep-tococcal reinfection and further damage to the heart. The role of chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of patients with either acute streptococcal disease or nonsuppurative complica-tions is yet to be ascertained. Vaccines Multivalent streptococcal vaccine containing multiple M protein epitopes has been evaluated; its efficacy is being proved in animal models. The vaccine is still in experimental stage and yet to be used in clinical practice. Streptococcus agalactiae S. agalactiae is the only species belonging to group B strepto-cocci. This is a pathogen of the cattle causing bovine mastitis, hence named \"agalactiae\". S. agalactiae are Gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs and short chains in clinical specimens and are morphologically similar to S. pyogenes. The cocci grow read-ily on enriched medium, such as blood agar and produce large colonies after overnight incubation. S. agalactiae are found as commensals in the genitourinary tract and lower gastrointestinal tract. Vaginal carriage rate as high as 40-50% has been observed in some pregnant women. More than 50% of infants born to these mothers through vagi-nal delivery are colonized with S. agalactiae. S. agalactiae in neonates can cause either early-onset or late-onset infections. Early-onset infection is acquired either in utero or from mother's vagina during delivery. The clinical symptoms develop during the first week of life. The condi-tion is characterized by septicemia, meningitis, or pneumo-nia. Late-onset infection is acquired from mother or from another infant (environment) during 2-12 weeks of life. The condition manifests as septicemia and meningitis. S. agalactiae in pregnant women causes urinary tract infec-tion particularly immediately after delivery. In nonpregnant women and in men, S. agalactiae can cause infections, such as osteomyelitis, arthritis, peritonitis, and skin infections. The condition is diagnosed by culturing the specimen in the blood agar and identifying the colonies by various tests as men-tioned below: 1. CAMP test: CAMP (Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson) test was first described in 1944 by Christie, Atkins, and Munch-Peterson. The basis for the test is that S. agalactiae produces a diffusible and heat-stable protein, known as CAMP fac-tor, which of RBCs. The staphylococci produce an enzyme sphingomyelinase C, which binds to the RBCs present in the blood agar. On exposure to CAMP factor liberated by S. agalactiae, RBCs undergo hemolysis, producing a butterfly appearance (Fig. 24-5, Color Photo 17). In this test, S. aureus is streaked from top to bottom on a blood agar plate. Then perpendicular streaks of S. agalactiae are made on either side, leaving at least 1 cm space from S. aureus. The plate is incu-bated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 20% CO 2. Haemolysis showing a typ- ical butterfly appearance indicates a positive test. S. agalactiae CAMP positive.2. Hippurate hippuric acid.3. Demonstration of group-specific cell wall antigen: The bacteria are identified by the group-specific cell wall polysac-charide antigen or B antigen. This antigen is composed of rhamnose, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose.4. anti-gens, been 11 distinct serotypes (Ia, Ia/c, Ib/c, II, IIc, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII). Serum antibodies confer specific protection against these serotypes. Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of S. agalactiae infection. Vancomycin is given to persons allergic to penicillins. Recently, strains resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline have been documented. Other Hemolytic Streptococci Streptococci belonging to groups C, F, and G, and rarely H, K, O, and R can also be associated with human infections. Group C Streptococci Group C streptococci are usually pathogens of animals. Streptococcus equisimilis is a group C Streptococcus, which can FIG. 24-5. CAMP test occasional infections humans. S. equisimilis resembles S. pyogenes in fermenting trehalose but differs from it by not fermenting ribose. Like S. pyogenes, it also produces SLO, strep-tokinase, and other proteins. It causes upper respiratory tract infections and also pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, brain abscess, and puerperal sepsis. S. equisimilis shows tolerance to treatment with penicillin; therefore patients may not respond to treatment with penicillin. Group F Streptococci These cocci are called \"minute streptococci\". They grow on blood agar well in the presence of CO 2. Streptococcus MG is a member of this group that can cause primary atypical pneumo-nia in humans. Demonstration of cold agglutinins in serum is diagnostic of primary atypical pneumonia. Group G Streptococci Group G streptococci are the commensals of humans and of animals, such as monkeys and dogs. They may occasionally cause infections, such as tonsillitis, urinary tract infection, and endocarditis in Streptococcus equinus are the nonentero-coccal group D streptococci, which are associated with human infections, such as urinary tract infections and rarely endocar-ditis. They are susceptible to penicillins. Viridans nonhemolytic streptococci. These are found as commensal flora in the oral cavity, oropharynx, gastro-intestinal tract, and genitourinary tract. These bacteria pro-duce a green pigment on the blood agar and hence are called viridans (Latin for \"green\"). Most isolates of viridans strep-tococci do not possess a group-specific carbohydrate; hence, they cannot be classified under Lancefield classification of streptococci. These cocci, however, have been classified into differ- mitis, S. salivarius, etc. based on various properties, such as (a) cell wall composition, (b) production of dextrans and levans, and (c) fermentation of sugars. Viridans streptococci are nutritionally fastidious, requiring complex media supported with blood for their growth. Growth of the colonies is facilitated by the presence of 5-10% carbon dioxide. Some strains are nutritionally deficient, requiring supplementation of pyridoxal, the active form of vitamin B 6 for their growth. Viridans streptococci can cause a variety of infections. They are commonly implicated in dental caries, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and intra-abdominal suppurative infections. S. the most common causative agent of bacterial endocarditis in individuals with preexisting heart lesions. There is a transient bacteremia following tooth extraction or other dental procedures after which bacteria adhere to the damaged heart valves or prosthetic heart valves. Prophylac-tic use of antibiotics before dental procedures prevents such complications. S. mutans is an important causative agent of dental caries. It splits dietary sucrose, producing acid and a dextran. The acid damages the dentine. The dextran binds together exfo-liative epithelial cells, mucus, food debris, and bacteria to form dental plaques. Earlier, most strains of viridans streptococci were sensitive to penicillins. However, recently moderately resistant and highly resistant strains have been reported particularly in the S. mitis group. Broad-spectrum cephalosporins or vancomycin are rec-ommended for treatment of these penicillin-resistant strains. Table 24-4 summarizes the differences between important biochemical characteristics of common streptococci. Enterococcus The enterococci were classified earlier as group D streptococci, because they possess the group D cell wall antigen. These entero-cocci, however, showed several distinctive features (Table 24-5) by which they were separated from the streptococci. Thiercelin proposed the term Enterococcus in 1899. The term enterococ-cal group was used by Sherman to describe the streptococci that grew at 10-45\u00b0C, with pH 9.6, in broth containing 6.5% sodium chloride and survived heating to 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Based on acid formation from mannitol, sorbitol, and Characters Streptococcus Enterococcus Arrangement of bacteria Pairs or in short chainsPairs of oval cocci Growth in the presence of 40% bile/H11002/H11001 Growth in the presence of 6.5% sodium chloride/H11002/H11001 Growth at 45\u00b0C /H11002/H11001 Growth at hydrolysis of arginine, genus Enterococcus is classi-fied into five groups (Table 24-6). The genus Enterococcus has 16 species. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are two important species known to cause human infections. The enterococci are Gram-positive, spherical, oval, or coc- cobacillary and are arranged in pairs and short chains. Most of the species are nonmotile and noncapsulated. They grow at a temperature range of 35-37\u00b0C. Colonies on blood agar media are 1-2 mm in diameter and alpha-hemolytic (actually nonhemolytic; appearance of alpha-hemolysis is due to the production of the enzyme peroxidase rather than hemoly-sins). Some cultures are beta-hemolytic on agar containing rabbit, horse, or human blood but not on agar containing sheep blood. Enterococcus durans is beta-hemolytic on agar containing sheep blood as well. On MacConkey agar they produce tiny and magenta- colored colonies. On potassium tellurite agar they produce black colonies. Bile-esculin-azide Groups Species of Enterococcus A 32-year-old male was admitted to a hospital with fever, chills, and generalized body pain. The patient had received multiple courses of antibiotics prescribed by private practitioners. Serum of the patient was tested positive for HIV by ELISA. Blood culture showed growth with Gram-positive cocci. The colonies were positive with group D antisera. These were PYRase test positive, CAMP test negative, resistant to bacitracin, and they did not hydrolyze hippurate. The bacterial isolate was identified as enterococci. The isolate showed resistance to penicillin and vancomycin. Which is the most likely bacteria species to cause this condition? What are the other tests you will perform to identify the bacteria? What antibiotics you will use to treat this infection?CASE STUDYmedium and Columbia colistin-nalidixic acid agar are used as selective media. They are catalase negative and are resistant to optochin and bile. They ferment sucrose, sorbitol, man-nitol, and esculin. They are PYRase test positive, CAMP test negative, resistant to bacitracin, and they do not hydrolyze hippurate. They possess two important virulence factors: (a) aggrega- tion substances and (b) carbohydrate adhesions. Aggregation substances are hair-like proteins that facilitate binding of bac-teria to the epithelial cells. Carbohydrate adhesins facilitate binding of cocci to host cells gelatinase. Cytolysin and phero-mone are the other virulence factors. The cell wall of the bacte-ria possesses group-specific antigen, which is group D glycerol teichoic acid. The enterococci are commonly found in gastrointestinal and genital tract of humans and animals. Enterococci are non-pathogenic but now are emerging as important agents of noso-comial infection. They cause urinary tract infection especially in hospitalized patients. Indwelling catheters and urinary tract instrumentation are important predisposing factors. They are frequently isolated from cases of wound infections particularly intra-abdominal. They also cause bacteremia, infection of the bile duct, and endocarditis. The antimicrobial therapy includes combination of ami- noglycosides with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin. Enterococci are less sensitive to penicillin and gentamicin and are resistant to cephalosporins. Plasmid-mediated resistance is a major cause of resistance among drug-resistant strains of Enterococcus. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has been emerging 193 5/14/2012 3:07:54 PMMycobacterium classified as Diplococcus pneumoniae. The bacterium has now been reclassified as Streptococcus pneumoniae due to its genetic similarities to Streptococcus. S. pneumoniae, however, differs from streptococci in its mor-phology (by having a specific polysaccharide capsule), bile solubility, and optochin sensitivity. Streptococcus pneumoniae A lot of advances have been made toward the better under-standing of the pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance, and use of vaccines in pneumococcal infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology S. pneumoniae shows the morphological features: They are cocci measuring 0.5-1.25 /H9262m in diameter. Older cells decolorize rapidly and might appear Gram negative. In clinical specimens, they appear typically \"lanceolate shaped\" with one end pointed and the other end round. They are arranged in pairs (diplococci) with the broad ends in apposition to each other. In cultures, they usu-ally appear more rounded and are arranged in short chains (Color Photo 18). They are capsulated. A polysaccharide capsule completely envelops each pair of cocci. The capsule is visualized by stain-ing it directly with specific stains or by Indian ink negative staining or by Quellung reaction (Color Photo 19). They are nonsporing and nonmotile. Culture S. pneumoniae is an aerobe and a facultative anaerobe. It grows at an optimum temperature of 37\u00b0C (range 25-42\u00b0C) and pH 7.8 (range 6.5-8.3). The growth is enhanced by the presence of 5-10% CO 2. Pneumococci are fastidious. They grow only on an enriched media, such as blood agar or chocolate agar (supple-mented with blood products), which will supply nutrients, pH buffers, etc.Blood agar: On blood agar, morphology of the colonies var-ies depending on the nature of the strain (whether capsulated or noncapsulated), the type of incubation (whether aerobic or anaerobic), and the time of incubation: Colonies on blood agar in anaerobic incubation show discoloration), but hemolysis in aerobic incubation (Color Photo 20). Capsulated strains after overnight incubation produce round and mucoid colonies measuring 1-3 mm in diam-eter. Some strains, e.g., type 3 S. pneumoniae (most virulent), produce copious quantities of capsular material and hence produce large mucoid colonies. Noncapsulated strains produce small and flat colonies. On prolonged incubation, the colonies undergo autoly-sis and the centers become flattened or depressed (umbo-nation) and edges become raised, giving the colonies a typical draughtsman appearance (Fig. 25-1). The central flattening or depression is due to the production of intra-cellular enzymes, such as amidase, which lyses the bacteria. Bile salts, sodium lauryl sulfate, and other surface active agents enhance the process of autolysis of the bacterial colonies. The capsules are present in strains isolated from clinical specimens but are lost on repeated cultivation, which is called smooth to rough variation.Smooth to rough variation: The capsules are present in strains isolated from clinical specimens but are lost on repeated cultivation. This is called smooth to rough varia-tion. Noncapsulated rough (R) strains are avirulent; these forms arise as spontaneous mutants and outgrow the parental smooth (S) strains in artificial culture. In tissues R forms are eliminated by phagocytosis. Transformation of a rough strain to a smooth one is also possible by treatment with smooth capsular substance containing DNA. FIG. 25-1. Draughtsman shows following reactions: S. pneumoniae ferments many sugars, producing acid only but no gas. Fermentation of sugars is carried out in Hiss's serum water or in serum agar slopes. S. pneumoniae ferments inulin, and this is an important test to differentiate it from those streptococci that do not fer-ment inulin. S. the peptidoglycan of the cell wall; hence in old cultures, typical draughtsman colonies are formed. This autolytic activity can be augmented by surface active agents, such as bile and bile salts. Bile solubility is a constant feature of pneumococci, and is positive in all the capsulated and some noncapsulated variants. Pneumococci are catalase and oxidase negative. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Pneumococci are delicate bacteria. They are killed by heating at 52\u00b0C for 15 minutes and by usual strengths of disinfectants. Pneumococcal colonies die on prolonged incubation.Optochin sensitivity test : Pneumococci are sensitive to optochin (ethyl hydrocupreine)\u2014a useful property to differentiate these from streptococci. Optochin sensitivity is usually performed by a paper disk containing 5 /H9262g of the compound; an inhibition zone of 14 mm or more indicates sensitivity to optochin. In recent times, occasional optochin-resistant pneumococci have also been documented. The target of optochin in pneumococci is an H /H11001 ATPase, and resistance is thought to be due to a point mutation in one of subunit a /H11002 or c/H11002 of the H /H11001 ATPase. This resistance to optochin is not related to the virulence of the bacteria. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of S. pneumoniae consists of the following compo-nents (Fig. 25-2): Capsule: The polysaccharide capsule surrounds the cell wall. The capsule is essential for virulence, its role being to protect the cocci from phagocytosis. Cell wall: It consists of peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, and proteins. Peptidoglycan: Peptidoglycan confers rigidity to the cell wall. Teichoic acid: The teichoic acid present in cell wall is of two types: (a) C polysaccharide and (b) Forssman or F antigen. C polysaccharide: It is present on the surface of cell wall. The exposed part of teichoic acid, which is linked FIG. 25-2. Schematic diagram of antigenic structure of Strep tococcus pneumoniae.Polysaccharide coat PeptidoglycanTeichoic acid Cell membraneLipoteichoic acid TAs are linked to the peptidoglycan via a phosphodiester linkage, whereas LTAs are linked to the cell membrane viaa C-terminal fatty acylgroup.Choline-binding proteins are linked to LTAs via choline-binding domains (CBDs).Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are located in the periplasmic space and interact with the peptidoglycan.Choline-binding proteins Penicillin-binding 25196 BACTERIOLOGY to peptidoglycan layer and extends through the capsule, is known as C polysaccharide or C antigen. This is a spe-cies-specific antigen and in no way related to the group-specific C carbohydrate antigen found in beta-hemolytic streptococci. The C polysaccharide present in the cell wall of pneumococci precipitates with C reactive protein (CRP), protein: The CRP is an acute-phase substance synthesized in the liver. It is not produced specifically against C antigen of pneumococci. It is present in low concentrations in healthy individuals, but the concen-tration increases in inflammation, malignancies, and bacterial infections. CRP increases during pneumonia and disappears during convalescence, hence can be used as a prognostic tool. CRP is used as an index of the treat-ment in rheumatic fever and certain other conditions. F antigen: F antigen is the other type of teichoic acid, which is covalently bound to the lipids in cytoplasmic membrane. It is so called because it cross-reacts with the Forssman sur-face antigen of the mammalian cells. F proteins mediate the binding of pneumococci to the host cell surface. M protein: M protein is a type-specific protein similar to the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, but is immu-nologically distinct. Antibodies against M proteins are not protective, as they do not inhibit phagocytosis of pneumococci. Serotyping of pneumococci Capsular humans and rabbits. The capsular polysaccharide is also called specific soluble sub-stance (SSS) as it diffuses into the culture medium or infective pus or host tissues. S. pneumoniae are classified into more than 90 different serotypes (1-90) based on the antigenic structure of the capsular polysaccharide. Of these, only 23 serotypes are associated with pneumococcal diseases. Serotyping of S. pneu-moniae is not carried out routinely and is done only for epide-miological studies. There are three typing methods: Agglutination of the bacteria with type-specific antiserum by co-agglutination (Co-A) test. The Co-A test is a rapid slide agglutination test, uses less antiserum, and is in complete agreement with Quellung test. Precipitation of the specific soluble substances with specific serum by counter-current immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). This is also a rapid test used to serotype pneumococci. Capsular swelling reaction with type-specific antiserum by \"Quellung reaction\". This is called capsular swelling reac-tion due to swelling (Latin quellung: swelling) of the capsule observed in this test. This reaction was first described by Neufeld in the year 1902. In this test, a drop of type-specific antiserum is added to a drop of suspension of pneumococci on a glass slide along with a drop of methylene blue solution. The capsule, in the presence of the specific homologous anti-serum, becomes apparently swollen, clearly delineated, and refractile.Pathogenesis and Immunity Pneumococci cause disease primarily by their capacity to mul-tiply in host tissues by avoiding the host defense mechanisms (Table 25-1). Virulence factors Capsule: Virulent strains of S. pneumoniae have a complex polysaccharide capsule. The acidic and hydrophilic nature of the capsule allows the bacteria to escape phagocytosis by macrophages.Pneumolysin: Pneumolysin is a toxin produced by pneumococci. The toxin alters the mucociliary clearance function of respiratory epithelium and inhibits phagocytic cell oxidative burst essential for intracellular killing of the bacteria. It activates the classical complement pathway resulting in the production of C3a and C5a, thereby contributing to the disease enzyme produced by pneumococci disrupts secretory IgA-mediated clearance of the bacteria and thereby enhances the ability of the bacteria to colonize mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.Cell wall associated polymers and proteins: These include teichoic acid, peptidoglycan, protein adhesin, phosphor-ylcholine, F protein, etc. that contribute to pathogenesis of pneumococcal diseases in various ways as mentioned in Table 25-1. Virulence factors Biological functions Cell wall associated polymers and proteinsCapsule Prevents phagocytosis Teichoic acid Binds to epithelial cells and activates alternative complement pathway Peptidoglycan Activates alternative complement pathway Protein adhesin Binds to epithelial cells Phosphorylcholine Mediates invasion of host cell by cocciF protein Mediates attachment to epithelial cells EnzymesSecretory IgA protease secretory IgAToxinsPneumolysin Alters mucociliary respiratory and inhibits phagocytic cell oxidative burst essential for of the bacteria Autolysin muramoyl- L-alanine amidase that along with a glycosidase enzyme function during cell division to separate daughter cells and to break down the organism after exponential growthTABLE diseases S. pneumoniae causes disease through the following stages: (i ) colonization and invasion, (ii ) tissue destruction, and (iii ) avoidance of opsonization and phagocytosis.Colonization and invasion: S. pneumoniae colonizes the oropharynx by adhering to the epithelial cells of pharynx. This adhesion is mediated by pneumococcal neuraminidase of an enzyme, secretory IgA protease, which destroys the secretory IgA and thereby enhances the ability of the cocci to colonize mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. Pneumolysin liberated by the cocci destroys the ciliated epi-thelial cells and phagocytic cells by binding to cholesterol in the epithelial cell membrane. This adversely affects mucociliary clearance function of respiratory epithelium.Tissue destruction: The process of tissue destruction is mediated by factors, such as cell wall teichoic acid, peptidogly-can, and phosphorylcholine. The destructive action is further supplemented by hydrogen peroxide produced by the bacteria. The peptidoglycan-teichoic acid complex of the pneumococ-cus is highly inflammatory. This complex activates the alternate complement pathway producing C5a, which being chemotaxic attracts neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Migration of inflammatory cells to the site of infection is the key feature of pneumococcal infection. The activated leuko-cytes produce cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-/H9251 , which further contribute to the migration of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, tissue damage, fever, and other manifesta-tions of pneumococcal disease. Phosphorylcholine present in the bacterial cell wall binds with phosphodiesterase-activating factors of the host endothelial cells and helps the cocci to enter the host cells.Avoidance of opsonization and phagocytosis: The ability to evade phagocytosis allows S. pneumoniae to survive, multi-ply, and spread to various organs. The antiphagocytic action of capsule is further supplemented by pneumolysin, which causes inhibition of phagocytic cell oxidative burst, required for intracellular killing of bacteria. Host immunity Host immunity is type specific with production of anticapsular antibodies. These antibodies appearing in serum 5-8 days after the onset of infection are protective against the pneumococ-cal serotype causing the infection. Natural immunity follows infections as well as colonization. Clinical Syndromes Ninety serotypes of S. pneumoniae have been identified with varying degrees of pathogenicity, out of which 23 serotypes are known to cause disease in humans. S. pneumoniae serotypes 3, 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F cause the majority of invasive disease. S. pneumoniae causes (a) pneumonia, ( b ) meningitis, (c) sinusitis and otitis media, (d ) bacteremia, and (e) other infections. Pneumonia S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, both lobar and bronchopneumonia. Pneumonia develops when bac-terium multiplies in the alveoli. Since the disease is associated with aspiration and is localized in the lower lobes of the lungs, it is called lobar pneumonia. Pneumonia is common at the extreme of ages, in children and in elderly, who have a more generalized bronchopneumonia. S. pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of child- hood pneumonia, especially in children younger than 5 years. Serotypes 6, 14, 18, 19, and 23 are responsible for most cases of pneumonia in children, while serotypes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 12 cause pneumonia in adults leading to mortality in more than 5-10%. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella atypi- cal pneumonia. Meningitis Pneumococcus is the most common cause of pyogenic men-ingitis in children, although the condition can occur in all age groups. Meningitis is always secondary to other pneumococ-cal infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, infections of the ear or sinuses. The bacteria reach the brain through blood stream or from nasopharynx (following head trauma or dural tear particularly with cerebrospinal fluid leak). Pneumococcal meningitis is now emerging as a com- mon cause of death in children and in adults. Meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae is associated with a higher mortal-ity and more neurological complications than the menin-gitis caused by any other bacteria. Even with antibacterial therapy, the mortality due to pneumococcal causing meningitis. Sinusitis and otitis media Sinusitis and otitis media occur in patients with prior viral infections. The viral infection lowers the mucosal immunity, facilitating the invasion by S. pneumoniae. Sinusitis caused by the pneumococci occurs in patients of all ages, but otitis media caused by the bacteria is seen only in young children. Pneumococci cause approximately 40% of otitis media cases. H. influenzae is another causative agent. Bacteremia This condition is more frequent in children than in adults. Bacteremia occurs in more than two-thirds of patients with meningitis and in one-fourth of the patients with pneumococ-cal pneumonia. This does not occur in patients with sinusitis or otitis media. Chap-25.indd 197 5/14/2012 3:05:27 PMSection III These include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, postsplenec-tomy sepsis, endocarditis associated with rapid destruction of heart valves, bone and joint infections (prosthetic or natural joint septic arthritis, occasionally as a complication of rheu-matoid arthritis), myositis, and brain and epidural abscesses. All these infections result from seeding of tissues during bacteremia. Epidemiology Geographical distribution S. pneumoniae is worldwide in distribution. It is the major cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. S. pneu-moniae serotypes 6, 14, 18, 19, and 23 are usually associated with infections in children, whereas serotypes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 12 predominate in infections in adults. S. pneumoniae sero-types 6, 14, 18, and 23 cause 60-80% of lower respiratory tract infections. Pneumococcal infection accounts for more deaths than any other vaccine preventable disease. Children between 6 months and 4 years of age and adults over 60 years of age are most commonly at risk for pneumococcal infection. In developing countries like India, the incidence of pneumococcal diseases in children is many times higher than that in the developed countries. Habitat S. pneumoniae is a normal inhabitant of throat and nasophar-ynx. Nasopharyngeal colonization occurs in approximately 5-75% of the population. Colonization is more common in children than in adults. The colonization occurs at about 6 months of age. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Pneumococci are strict parasites, and cause infection only under specific predisposing conditions like prior viral or other infections, aspiration, immune suppression, anatomi-cal deformity, etc. S. pneumoniae infection occurs exclusively in human beings, and no animal reservoir is found in nature. Respiratory and pharyngeal secretions of carriers and patients are the sources of infection. Horizontal transmission requires close person-to-person contact, hence overcrowding facili-tates spread of infection. Infection is acquired by inhalation of droplets nuclei and by coming in contact with contaminated fomites. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar fluid (CSF), joint fluid, abscess fluid, bones, and other biopsy material are the specimens col-lected for Gram staining and culture. Microscopy Gram staining of sputum: It is a rapid method for diagno- sis of acute pneumonia. Stained smears showing lanceolate-shaped, Gram-positive cocci in pairs surrounded by a capsule is good evidence for pneumococcal infection. The morphology of the pneumococci may be altered in the patient receiving anti-bacterial therapy. Key Points Gram staining of CSF: It is a rapid method for demonstra- tion of Gram-positive diplococci\u2014inside the polymorphs as well as outside in a CSF smear. Gram staining is positive in 90% of these cases (Fig. 25-3, Color Photo 21). Gram staining of a buffy coat or blood smear: It is frequently positive in cases of overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis and is useful for rapid presumptive diagnosis of this condition. In acute pneumococcal otitis media, Gram stain of an aspirated fluid smear from middle ear is useful to demonstrate the bacteria. Culture Sputum is plated on blood agar and incubated in the presence of 5-10% carbon dioxide. Gray colonies with alpha-hemolysis are observed after overnight incubation. Sputum culture may be negative due to normal flora outgrowing pneumococci or due to rapid autolysis. Diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis is confirmed by CSF culture and is positive in 90% of untreated cases. However, the culture is negative in more than 50% of cases who have received treatment even with a single dose of antibiotics. In the acute phase of pneumonia, the blood can be cultured in glucose broth. Demonstration of the pneumococci in the blood shows bad prognosis. Culture of aspirated fluid from the middle ear or from the sinus is a definitive method for diagnosis of otitis media or sinusitis. However, culture is not recommended for specimens collected from the nasopharynx or from external ear. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of S. pneumoniae are summarized in Box 25-1. S. pneumoniae colonies are identified by the following tests:FIG. 25-3. Gram-stained smear of CSF cocci arranged in pairs. On blood agar, produces alpha hemolysis. 3. Bile solubility test positive. 4. Optochin sensitivity test positive. 5. Inulin fermentation test positive.Box 25-1 features of Streptococcus pneumoniae Optochin sensitivity test: S. pneumoniae is identified by its sensitivity to optochin. In this method, a filter paper disc con-taining optochin (ethylhydrocupreine dihydrochloride) is applied on the middle of blood agar plate streaked with pneumococci and is incubated overnight. A zone of inhibition of 14 mm or more is observed around the disk after overnight incubation.Bile solubility test: This is a very useful test to identify S. pneumoniae. It detects an autolytic enzyme, amidase, present in pneumococci, which breaks the bond between alanine and muramic acid of the peptidoglycan of the pneumococcal cell wall. The enzyme amidase is activated by bile salts present in bile, resulting in lysis of pneumococci. The test is carried out by applying a loopful of 10% sodium deoxycholate solution on the young colonies in the blood agar. Most colonies of pneu-mococci are dissolved within a few minutes.Inulin fermentation test: Pneumococci ferment inulin; hence inulin fermentation test is a useful test to differentiate pneumococci from streptococci as the latter do not ferment it.Animal inoculation: S. pneumoniae can be isolated from clini- cal specimens containing few pneumococci by intraperitoneal inoculation in mice. Pneumococci are demonstrated in the peritoneal exudate and heart blood of the mice, which die 1-3 days after inoculation. Table 25-2 summarizes important Serodiagnosis Pneumococcal antigen detection: test to detect pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antigen in the CSF for diagnosis of meningitis, and in the blood or urine for diagnosis of bacteremia and pneumonia. Latex agglutination test using the latex particles coated with anti-CRP antibody is employed to detect C reactive protein. The CRP is used as a prognostic marker in acute cases of acute pneumococcal pneu-monia, acute rheumatic fever, and other infectious diseases. CRP is found in sera from cases of acute pneumonia but is absent during the convalescent phase of the disease.Pneumococcal antibody detection: The indirect hemagglu-tination, indirect fluorescent antibody test, and ELISA are used to demonstrate specific pneumococcal antibodies in invasive pneumococcal diseases. Treatment Most pneumococci are susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin.Characters Streptococcus pneumoniaeStreptococcus viridans Arrangement of bacteria lanceolate diplococciPairs of oval cocci, short chains Polysaccharide capsule Present Absent Colonies Draughtsman coloniesDome shaped Growth in liquid medium Uniform turbidity Granular turbidity Bile solubility Positive Negative Optochin sensitivity Positive Negative Inulin fermentation Positive Negative Quellung reaction Positive Negative Intraperitoneal mice NonpathogenicTABLE distinguishing pneumococci and viridans streptococci Vaccines Pneumococcal vaccines are not recommended for general use, but for persons who are at higher risk of getting pneumococ-cal infections. Followings are the vaccines against pneumococcal inf ections is now available in many countries. The vaccine contains capsular antigens from each of 23 serotypes of S. pneumoniae most com-monly involved in human infections. The vaccine is effective and safe in children older than 5 years. It is not recommended for use in children younger than 2 years, as polysaccharide antigen, being T-cell independent, does not induce adequate immune response in children younger than 2 years. There is no long-lasting immunity, and the antibody level attained is not adequate. 2. 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: This is a vaccine made a vailable recently f or the immunization of infants and toddlers against invasive pneumococcal dis-ease caused by capsular serotypes polysaccharide antigen is conjugated with a T-cell-dependent protein and so it can be used in children younger than 2 years. Vaccines are recommended for the following groups of persons: 1. Elderly persons aged 65 years or more. 2. Persons aged 2-64 years who are suffering from chronic illnesses, such as chronic cardio vascular disease, chronic pulmonar y disease, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syn- drome, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and alcoholism. 3. Persons who are splenectomized, particularly those suf-fering from sickle cell disease. 4. Immunocom promised persons, such as with human immunodef iciency virus (HIV) inf ection, leukemia, lym- phoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, malignancy, organ or bone marrow transplantation and persons receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Chap-25.indd are suscep-tible to penicillin. Strains that are susceptible to penicillin are also susceptible to nearly all other antibiotics. But since 1977, penicillin-resistant pneumococci are being increasingly docu-mented. Penicillin-resistant strains may be moderately resis-tant (minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, /H110220.1/H110021 /H9262g/ mL) or highly resistant (MIC /H113502 /H9262g/mL). The resistance to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics is not mediated by production of beta-lactamase enzymes, but is due to the modi-fications of proteins, such as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) found on the cell wall. These penicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to multiple drugs, such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, tetracycline, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sul-famethoxazole most often in S. pneumoniae serotypes 6, 9, 14, 19, and 23. The success of antibiotic therapy depends on drug con- centrations attained in the affected part of the body, which should be several times higher than the MIC of the organism. Beta-lactam antibiotics are not used alone for the treatment of meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci. This is because, adequate bactericidal levels against penicillin- resistant organisms in the central nervous system (CNS) are difficult to achieve with beta-lactam antibiotics. Ceftriaxone can be used for meningitis caused by ceftriaxone-susceptible pneumo-cocci (MIC /H110210.5 /H9262g/mL). Amoxicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci with intermediate resis-tance. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for non-CNS invasive pneumococcal diseases caused by penicillin- and ceftriaxone- resistant pneumococci. Vancomycin is used if the pneumococ-cus is resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC /H113500.5 /H9262g/mL). Prevention and Control Pneumococcal vaccines play an important role in prevention of pneumococcal diseases. A 6-year-old child was admitted to hospital with high-grade fever (/H11350103\u00b0C), headache, stiff neck, vomiting, lethargy, and altered sensorium for 3 days. Gram staining of the CSF smear showed Gram-positive cocci. The same bacteria were isolated from CSF by culture. The patient died despite prompt treatment with ceftriaxone. Which are the most likely bacteria to cause this fulminant condition? What other diseases are caused by this bacterium? What are the vaccines available against the infection caused by the bacteria in children? Do the bacteria show any resistance to antibiotics?CASE STUDY Chap-25.indd 200 5/14/2012 3:05:28 nonmotile cocci, typically arranged in pairs ( diplococci) with adjacent sides flattened together. The bacteria belonging to this genus are oxidase positive and mostly catalase positive. They ferment sugars with production of acid but no gas. The genus Neisseria consists of 10 species. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are the two important species that cause human infections. These two species are strictly pathogens for humans, whereas the other Neisseria species are commensals of the mouth and upper respiratory tract, and hence cause oppor-tunistic infections. Human infections caused by Neisseria are listed in Table 26-1. Neisseria gonorrhoeae N. gonorrhoeae is a strict human pathogen. It is the causative agent of gonorrhea, one of the most common sexually trans-mitted disease worldwide. Gonococci when transmitted non-sexually from the mother's genital tract to the newborn during birth cause ophthalmia neonatorum. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology N. gonorrhoeae shows following features: N. gonorrhoeae are Gram-negative and aerobic They are mostly intracellular\u2014found within the polymor-phonuclear (PMN) leukocytes\u2014and some cells contain as many as hundred cocci. Smears from the pus sample show the intracellular kidney-shaped cocci, typically arranged in pairs with concave sides facing each other. Freshly isolated bacteria may be capsulated. They do not form endospores. They are nonmotile. Culture N. gonorrhoeae is a fastidious coccus. It requires complex media for growth. The cocci grow on enriched media, such as blood or chocolate agar. These cannot grow on ordinary media, such as nutrient agar or Mueller-Hinton agar. They are aerobes but can also grow anaerobically. They grow optimally at a temperature range of 35-36\u00b0C. They fail to grow at temperature less than 25\u00b0C or greater than 37\u00b0C. The growth of bacteria is enhanced by incubation in humid atmosphere supplemented with 5-10% CO 2. 1. Blood agar: On blood agar at 24 hours, N. gonorrhoeae produces convex small colonies measuring 0.6 /H11003 1.4 /H9262 m in diameter. These colonies are translucent with entire edges and finely granular surface. They are soft and eas-ily emulsifiable. Gonococci are inhibited by fatty acids and trace metals present in the digested products of pep-tone found in the blood agar. Addition of soluble starch to the media neutralizes the toxic effects of the fatty acids. 2. Selective media: Tha yer Martin medium (chocolate agar medium containing antibiotics, such as colistin, nystatin, and vancomycin) and modified New York City medium (a translucent medium containing vancomycin, colistin, trimethoprim, and either nystatin or amphoteri-cin B) are selective media used for isolation of gonococci from the clinical specimens containing mixed micro-bial flora. In these media, the growth of contaminat-ing bacteria is suppressed including that of commensal Neisseria. On these media, N. gonorrhoeae produces small, translucent, and convex colonies, which are soft and eas-ily friable. Four types of colonies of gonococci have been recognized. These are T1, T2, T3, and T4. Types 1 and 2 are small and are brown pigmented colo-nies. The strains producing these colonies possess pili, are virulent and cause acute cases of gonorrhea. Types 3 and 4 are large and are nonpigmented colonies. The cocci producing these colonies do not possess pili and are Diseases Neisseria Opportunistic 3. Transport medium: Stuar t's transport medium is used for the collection and transport of clinical specimens to the laboratory for isolation and demonstration of N. gonorrhoeae. Biochemical reactions N. gonorrhoeae shows following features: Gonococci ferment glucose with the production of acid but no gas. They do not ferment maltose, lactose, sucrose, or fruc tose. This is an important feature to differentiate N. gonorrhoeae from N. meningitidis. N. gonorrhoeae utilizes glucose only, whereas N. meningitidis utilizes both glucose and maltose. They do not reduce nitrates, and they do not produce hydrogen sulfide. They are oxidase and catalase positive. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: The gonococci are highly delicate bacteria. They die rapidly on drying. They are also killed by soap, and many other disinfec-tants, such as phenol, chlorhexidine, and hexachlorophene and antiseptics. They are killed at a temperature as low as 25\u00b0C. Freeze drying or storing in liquid nitrogen are the most effec-tive methods for storage of gonococci for a longer period. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Properties The cell wall of N. gonorrhoeae like any other Gram-negative bacteria consists of three layers: outer cell surface, middle pep-tidoglycan layer, and inner cytoplasmic membrane. These con-tain following proteins (Fig. 26-1). Outer membrane proteins The outer membrane proteins (OMP) are present in the outer membrane. They mediate the uptake of iron essential for growth and metabolism of the cocci. They promote intake of iron by binding hemoglobin, transferrin, and lactoferrin. These proteins are of three types: The Por proteins The Opa proteins The Rmp proteins The Por proteins: The Por proteins, earlier known as protein I, are porin proteins that form pores or channels in the outer membranes. Por proteins are of two types: Por-A and Por-B, each with a variety of antigenic variations. Strains producing Por-A proteins are commonly associated with disseminated dis-ease because these proteins prevent killing of gonococci in the serum by the serum complement components. The antigenic variations observed in Por proteins form the basis for the sero-type classification of N. gonorrhoeae.The Opa proteins: These proteins, also known as opacity protein, were formerly known as protein II. These proteins are found in the membrane and mediate adherence of the bacteria to each other, and also to the eukaryotic cells. Strains produc-ing Opa proteins produce opaque colonies in culture.The Rmp proteins: These proteins, also known as reduction modifiable proteins, were formerly known as protein III. These are proteins found in the outer membrane of gonococci and lead to the production of antibodies that block serum bacteri-cidal activity against gonococci. Other important gonococcal proteins Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) is another major antigen present in the cell wall of the bacteria. This antigen consists of lipid A and oligosaccharide similar to that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. However, LOS does not show antigenic variation as found in LPS. LOS possesses endotoxic activity. IgA1 protease and penicillin. Pathogenesis and Immunity N. gonorrhoeae causes disease both by multiplying in tissues and by causing inflammation. The bacteria do not produce any toxins. Virulence factors N. gonorrhoeae produces several virulence factors as mentioned below (Table 26-2):Capsule: N. gonorrhoeae does not form a true carbohydrate capsule unlike N. meningitidis. Instead, it forms a polyphos-phate capsule, which is loosely associated with its cell surface. Capsule is most evident in freshly isolated gonococci and is antiphagocytic. It prevents phagocytosis of the gonococci.Pili: Pili are hair-like structures that extend from the cyto-plasmic membrane through the outer membrane. The pili are composed of the proteins known as pilins, which are repeating Lipopolysaccharide(Endotoxin)Peptidoglycan Protein I IgA Chapter 26NEISSERIA adherence to phagocytes. The Opa proteins also facilitate sub-sequent migration of gonococci into the epithelial cells. The Por proteins inhibit phagolysosome fusion in the phagocytes, thereby protecting the phagocytosed bacteria from intracellu-lar killing. Production of beta-lactamase (penicillinase) by the bacteria also contributes to the invasion. The host response is characterized by infiltration with leu- kocytes, followed by epithelial sloughing, formation of micro-abscesses in the submucosa, and production of purulent pus. The LOS of gonococcal cell wall stimulates the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-/H9251) and other inflamma-tory responses which contribute to most of the symptoms asso-ciated with gonococcal infection. Host immunity The main host defense mechanisms against gonococci are anti-bodies (IgA and IgG), complement, and neutrophils. Antibody response to gonococci is characterized by the production of serum IgG antibodies. IgG3 is the predominant immunoglobu-lin. Antibody response is strong against Opa proteins and LOS, whereas it is minimal against Por proteins. Antibodies to LOS cause activation of complement, thus producing a chemotac-tic effect on neutrophils. Gonococcal infection does not confer protection against reinfection. Repeated gonococcal infections occur due to the antigenic changes of the pili and outer mem-brane proteins. Persons with a deficiency of the late-acting complement components (C6-C9) are at a risk of disseminated infections. Clinical Syndromes N. gonorrhoeae cause following clinical syndromes (Fig. 26-2): other gonococcal diseases. Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. It is primarily a genital infection restricted to the urethra in men and cervix in women. The incubation period varies from 2 to 8 days.Gonorrhea in men: A symptomatic acute infection is seen in approximately 95% of all infected men. Urethritis is the major clinical manifestation, with burning micturition and serous urethral discharge as the initial manifestation. Subsequently, the discharge becomes more profuse, purulent, and even blood-tinged. Acute epididymitis, prostatitis, and periurethral abscess are rare, but are noted gonococcal complications in men.Gonorrhea in women: In women, endocervix is the primary site (80-90%) of infection because gonococci invade only the endocervical columnar epithelial cells. The bacteria cannot infect the squamous epithelial cells in the vagina of postpu-bescent women. Urethra (80%), rectum (40%), and pharynx (10-20%) are the other sites of infection in women. The infec-tion is mostly asymptomatic in women. The presence of vagi-nal discharge, dysuria, dyspareunia, and mild lower abdominal pain are the common symptoms in symptomatic women. In 10-20% of infected women, the primary infection may spread protein subunits. The expression of protein pilin is controlled by P gene complex. The pilins of all the strains of gonococci are antigenically different. There is a marked antigenic variation in gonococcal pili as a result of chromosomal rearrangement. More than 100 serotypes are known. The pili are important virulence factors: They play an important role in the virulence of the bacteria. They mediate attachment of gonococci to nonciliated epi-thelial cells. They also contribute to virulence by preventing ingestion and killing of gonococci by neutrophils. Other virulence factors: These include: Por protein of outer membrane protein (OMP) confers resis-tance to serum killing of gonococci by preventing fusion of phagolysosome in neutrophils. Opa proteins mediate bacterial adherence of bacteria to each other and to the eukaryotic cells. Rmp proteins produce antibodies that block serum bacteri-cidal activity against gonococci. Lipo-oligosaccharide of the bacteria possesses endotoxic activity. Pathogenesis of gonorrhea N. gonorrhoeae causes disease first by attaching themselves to mucosal cells. Subsequently, they enter the cells and multiply inside the cells and pass through the cells into the subepithe-lial space, thereby establishing the infection. Pili help in attach-ment of gonococci to mucosal surfaces and also contribute to the resistance by preventing ingestion and killing by PMN leukocytes. The outer membrane proteins, such as Opa proteins, facilitate adherence between gonococci and also increase Virulence factors Biological functions Capsule Prevents phagocytosis Pili Mediate attachment of gonococci to nonciliated epithelial cell; prevent ingestion and killing of gonococci by neutrophils Por proteins Confer resistance to serum killing of gonococci by preventing fusion of phagolysome in neutrophils Opa proteins Mediate bacterial adherence to each other, and to the eukaryotic cells Rmp proteins Produce antibodies that block serum bactericidal activity against gonococci Lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS)Possesses endotoxic Beta-lactamase Degrades beta-lactam rings in III Chapter 26204 BACTERIOLOGY from urethra and cervix to cause ascending genital infections including salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic inflam-matory disease (PID). Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is the most important complication in females following gonococcal infection. Increased vaginal discharge or purulent urethral discharge, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, and intermenstrual bleeding are the common symptoms of the PID. Tubal scarring, ecto-pic pregnancy, and infertility are the major complications in women following PID. Gonococcal vulvovaginitis occurs in prepubertal girls through sexual contact. Disseminated gonococcal infections Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) occurs because of hematogenous dissemination of gonococci from the primary site of infection. The symptoms vary greatly from patient to patient. Arthritis-dermatitis syndrome is the classic presenta-tion of DGI. Joint or tendon pain is most common in the early stage of infection. Migratory polyarthralgia, especially of the knees, elbows, and more distal joints, and also tenosynovitis are the common symptoms. The skin lesions include maculopapu-lar to pustular lesions often with a hemorrhagic component. Septic arthritis, especially of the knee, is the next stage of DGI. During this stage, skin lesions usually disappear and blood cul-tures for gonococci are always negative. The DGI is mostly seen in untreated asymptomatic women and in persons with comple- ment deficiency. Pharyngitis Skin Genital infection ArthritisDisseminated infection Anorectal infection FIG. 26-2. Sites of infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Key Points The strains that cause DGI are characterized by their: Resistance to bactericidal action of serum, Marked sensitivity to penicillin, and Auxotropism for arginine, hypoxanthine, and uracil (for growth they require these substances in the medium). Ophthalmia neonatorum Ophthalmia neonatorum is a nonsexually transmitted infec-tion caused by N. gonorrhoeae. This is a condition of bilateral conjunctivitis of a neonate born by vaginal delivery to an infected mother. However, transmission to the newborn can also occur in utero or in the postpartum period. Pain in the eyes, redness, and purulent discharge are the common symptoms. Blindness is an important complication of this condition. Gonococci can cause permanent injury to the eye in a very short time; hence prompt recognition and treatment of the condi-tion are very essential to avoid blindness. Other gonococcal infections These include the following: Anorectal gonorrhea and gonococcal pharyngitis occur in homosexual men following rectal intercourse or by oro-genital contact, respectively. Pharyngitis is most commonly acquired during orogenital contact. Pharyngitis often is asymptomatic, however, it may exudative pharyn-gitis with autoinoculation of gonococci into the conjunctival sac from a primary site of infection, such as the genitals. The conjunctivitis may rapidly progress to panophthalmitis and loss of the eye unless promptly treated. Acute perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh and Curtis syndrome) occurs due to the direct extension of N. gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis from the fallopian tube to the liver capsule and overlying peritoneum. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Gonococcal infection is reported throughout the world. However, the incidence is much lower in the European coun-tries, and this condition has virtually been eliminated in Sweden. The highest incidence of gonorrhea and its complica-tions occurs in developing countries. The median prevalence of gonorrhea in pregnant women has been estimated to be 4% in Asia, 5% in Latin America, and 10% in Africa. Habitat N. gonorrhoeae is exclusively a human pathogen. The gonococci are only found in infected conditions. In infected women, the gonococci are most commonly found in the endocervix, and in Chap-26.indd 204 5/14/2012 1:30:30 PMSection III Chapter 26NEISSERIA 205 infected men found in the urethra. In both men and women gonococci can also be found in the pharynx, rectum, and eyes. The gonococci are not found as normal human flora in the mucosa of the urethra, cervix, or vagina. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Only humans, especially asymptomatic infected men and women, are reservoirs of infections. Asymptomatic carriage is more common in women than in men. Purulent urethra or cer-vical discharge is the most common source of infection. The infection is transmitted: Primarily by sexual contact. N. gonorrhoeae infection occurs following mucosal inoculation during vaginal, anal, or oral sexual contact. Increased sexual contact with infected part-ners increases the risk of acquiring the infection. Less frequently, by nonsexual contact. Ophthalmia neona-torum is acquired nonsexually. This infection occurs follow-ing a conjunctival inoculation during vaginal delivery. Less frequently, the disease is transmitted through rectum, oro-pharynx, or through the birth canal.Fomites do not play any role in transmission of the disease, because gonococci die rapidly outside the human body.Strain typing: Strains of N. gonorrhoeae can be typed by (a) auxotyping and (b) serotyping. Auxotyping is based on addition of specific nutrients and cofactors in the medium for the growth of gonococci. There are over 30 auxotypes. The most common auxotypes are prototrophic or wild type (Proto), praline-requiring type (Pro), and the strains requiring arginine, hypoxanthine, and uracil (AHU). Serotyping is based on the OMP \"Porin\", which is further divided into serovars (e.g., 1A-4, 1B-12) based on agglutina-tion with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of gonococcal infection depends on dem-onstration of N. gonorrhoeae at the site of infection. Specimens The genital (urethral discharge, cervical discharge, etc.), rectal, and pharyngeal specimens are collected for the isolation and identification of gonococci. In acute gonococcal infection , urethral discharge in males and cervical discharge in females are the specimens of choice. High vaginal swab in females is not satisfactory. When collecting specimens, such as endocervical discharge in women, the cervix is first cleaned of the exudate; a swab is then placed into the external os and rotated for several seconds. In males, discharge present at the meatus is collected for examination. The meatus is first cleaned with gauze soaked in saline. The urethral discharge is then col-lected with the help of a platinum loop. If no discharge is present at the meatus, urethral specimens are collected by inserting and rotating a small swab 2-3 cm into the ure-thra. A calcium alginate or Rayon swab on a metal shaft is usually used for this purpose. In chronic infection , since urethral discharge is less, the exudate after prostatic massage or morning drop of secretion and urine are also examined for the cocci. Rectal specimens are frequently useful for demonstration of gonococci in asymptomatic women and in homosexual and bisexual men. Samples are collected from all possible mucosal sites, such as pharynx, urethra, cervix, and rectum, and from blood and synovial fluid in patients with possible DGI.After collection, the specimens are transported and pro- cessed immediately in the laboratory. If delay is unavoidable, specimens are collected and transported to the laboratory in a transport medium, such as Stuart's transport medium. Microscopy Gram stain of urethral exudates: The presence of four or more oil-immersion Demonstration intracellular diplococci is characteristic of N. gonorrhoeae (Fig. 26-3, Color Photo 22). Gram stain helps in the presumptive diagnosis of the gonococcal infection. It is more than 90% sensitive and 98% specific for the diagno-sis of gonococcal infection in symptomatic males. However, in asymptomatic males, the sensitivity of the Gram stain is only 60% or less.In women, presence of more than 10 PMN per high-power field on an endocervical smear is suggestive of cervicitis. Gram stain of endocervical smears is less sensitive (50-60%) and 82-90% specific in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Gram stain is not a sensitive method for detection of gono- cocci in patients Chapter lesions. Specificity is also less because commensal Neisseria species in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract can be con-fused with those of N. gonorrhoeae.Wet mount examination of centrifuged deposit of urine sample: In men, the urine sample, preferably 10-15 mL of early morning (the first) voided urine, is collected and centri-fuged and examined under high power. The demonstration of 10 or more PMN in the centrifuged urine under high power is suggestive of urethritis. Culture Isolation of N. gonorrhoeae from clinical specimens by culture confirms the diagnosis of gonorrhea. Genital, rectal, and pha-ryngeal specimens are inoculated on a nonselective medium (e.g., blood agar or chocolate agar) and on a selective medium (e.g., Modified Thayer Martin medium). The colonies of gonococci on chocolate agar after 48 hours of incubation at 35-36\u00b0C in the presence of 5-10% CO 2 are small, round, translucent, and convex with finely granular surface. On Thayer Martin medium, the colonies show similar mor-phology as that on chocolate agar. The mixed microbial flora present in the clinical specimens is suppressed by the selective media. However, the vancomycin present in the selective media inhibits some strains of gonococci. Identification of bacteria N. gonorrhoeae are identified by the characteristics listed in Box 26-1. They are differentiated from N. meningitidis and other Neisseria species by a variety of tests (Table 26-3). 1. Gram-negative diplococci. 2. On blood agar, produces translucent colonies with entire edge and granular sur face. 3. Oxidase test positiv e. 4. Catalase test positive. 5. Ferments glucose with production of acid. 6. Does not ferment maltose or sucrose.Box 26-1 Identifying features of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Detection of gonococcal antigen The gonococcal antigens can be detected by both direct fluo-rescent antibody (DFA) test and direct enzyme-immunoassays (EIA) in urethral discharge and endocervical discharge as well as in other clinical specimens. The DFA using fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies is a rapid and useful method for demonstration of gonococcal antigens in clinical specimens. The EIA using polyclonal antigonococcal antibodies are also used for the detection of gonococcal antigens in clinical specimens. Serodiagnosis The serological tests are done to detect gonococcal antigens or specific anti-gonococcal antibodies in the serum for diagno-sis of gonorrhea. ELISA and RIA (radioimmunoassays) using whole cell lysates, pilus proteins, and LPS antigens of the gono-cocci demonstrate antibodies in the serum. These serological tests are not recommended for routine use. These are used only in specific situations, such as chronic gonorrhea, gonococcal arthritis, etc. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probes (Gen probe) are commercially available for the direct detection of bacteria in the genital and other clinical specimens. These probes are specific for nucleic acid of N. gonorrhoeae and are sensitive and rapid. The results become available within 2-4 hours, but these tests are highly expensive. Treatment Sulfonamides were used as early as in 1935 for treatment of gonorrhea. In the beginning, all the strains of gono-cocci were sensitive to sulfonamides but subsequently, they developed resistance to these antibiotics. Penicillin is the drug of choice for penicillin-sensitive strains of N. gonorrhoeae. Neisseria species Growth on Production of acid from BA at 22\u00b0C CHA NA at 35\u00b0C III of N. gonorrhoeae: Initially, gono- cocci were highly sensitive to penicillin (minimal inhibitory con-centration, or MIC, 0.005 U/mL). However, since 1957, strains of gonococci with decreased sensitivity (MIC /H110220.1 U/mL) to penicillin have been documented. The concentration of peni-cillin required to inhibit the growth of gonococci has increased by many folds and is now considerably higher (2.4-4.8 MU). Most of them are beta-lactamase (penicillinase) producing by the virtue of plasmid transmission. These strains show high level of resistance to penicillin. Some strains of N. gonorrhoeae not producing beta-lactamase but yet showing resistance to penicillin have also been reported. This resistance is mediated chromosomally and is of low level. Resistance to other antibiotics: Chromosomal-mediated resistance to other antibiotics, such as tetracycline, erythromy-cin, and aminoglycosides, has also been reported. Tetracyclines are no longer given for gonococcal infection because of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance. Resistance to ciprofloxacin has also been increasingly docu-mented in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Australia. Key Points Alternative drugs in cases of penicillin resistance or in penicillin-allergic individuals : Ceftriaxone, cefixime, cip- rofloxacin, or ofloxacin are the alternative drugs in cases of penicillin resistance or in penicillin-allergic individuals. A sin-gle-dose regimen of any of these antibiotics is given as an initial therapy in uncomplicated urethritis, cervicitis, or rectal or pha-ryngeal infections in adults. A single dose of ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly or cefixime (400 mg), ciprofloxacin (500 mg), or ofloxacin (400 mg) as a single dose orally is also effective. Immediate saline irrigation and intravenous ceftriaxone are effective for treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis. Local of 0.5% of 1% tetracycline or 1% is effective for treatment of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. PID as such is a mixed infection of gonococci, Chlamydia, and other facultative anaerobic pathogens. The treatment, therefore, is by broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all infect-ing organisms. Prevention and Control Currently, there is no effective vaccine available against N. gonorrhoeae. Chemoprophylaxis by the prophylactic use of penicillin is also ineffective and may promote the development of resistant strains. Therefore, (a) health education, (b) early detection of cases, (c) tracing of contacts, and (d) follow-up of screening of sexual contacts is important in the prevention of gonorrheal epidemics. Furthermore, the prevention of gonor-rhea involves the promotion of safe sex and individual counsel-ing. Gonococcal conjunctivitis in the newborns is prevented by using erythromycin ointment.Neisseria meningitidis N. meningitidis causes a spectrum of diseases ranging from meningococcemia (which is rapidly fatal) to a transient bac-teremia (which is relatively benign). It is also the second most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology N. meningitidis shows following features: N. meningitidis are Gram-negative, spherical, or oval cocci arranged in pairs with the adjacent sides flattened. The cocci are generally intracellular in PMN in smears from pus cells and other specimens. They measure 0.6-0.8 /H9262m in diameter. Freshly isolated bacteria are usually capsulated. They are nonmotile and nonsporing. Culture Meningococci are strict aerobes. They grow optimally at a tem-perature between 36\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C and optimum pH of 7.4-7.6. Their growth is enhanced by incubation in a moist atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO 2. Meningococci are fastidious bacteria with complex nutri- tional requirements. They do not grow on ordinary media, but grow well on the medium enriched with blood or serum, such as blood agar, chocolate agar, and Mueller-Hinton agar. The blood or serum promotes growth of bacteria by neutralizing inhibitory substances found in the media rather than by pro-viding additional requirements. 1. Blood agar: On blood agar , N. meningitidis produces small, round (1-2 mm in diameter), convex, gray, and translucent nonpigmented colonies with entire edges after 24 hours of incubation. At 48 hours, the colonies become larger with an opaque raised center and crenated with transparent margin. It does not produce any hemolysis on blood agar. Strains of meningococci with large polysaccharide capsule appear as mucoid colonies. Meningococci produce large colonies on chocolate agar. 2. Selective media: Tha yer Martin medium with antibiot- ics (vancomycin, colistin, nystatin, and trimethoprim) and New York City medium are the selective media commonly used for the isolation of the bacteria from clinical speci-mens containing mixed bacterial flora. Biochemical reactions N. meningitidis shows following reactions: N. meningitidis is oxidase and catalase positive. These two tests are important biochemical markers for preliminary identification of The test can be performed in two ways: In the first method, 1% solution of oxidase reagent (tetramethyl paraphenylene-diamine-dihydrocholoride) is poured on the culture media; the Neisseria colonies turn deep purple. In the second method, a few colonies of Neisseria are rubbed with a glass rod on a strip of filter paper moistened with oxidase reagent. A deep purple color develops immediately. N. meningitidis ferments glucose and maltose with acid but no gas. It does not ferment sucrose or lactose. Fermentation tests are required for final identification of Neisseria species (Box 26-2). It does not produce hydrogen sulphide and does not reduce nitrates. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: N. menin- gitidis are highly delicate organisms. They are highly sensitive to heat, desiccation, and disinfectants. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of pathogenic meningococci contains a toxic LPS or endotoxin. The meningococcal endotoxin is chemically identical to the are subdivided into 13 serogroups (A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z, W135, 29E, H, I, K, and L). Meningococci belonging to group A, B, and C are responsible for most of the epidemics and outbreaks of meningitis. Group Y and group W135 meningococci cause disease more commonly than groups X and Z. Meningococci that lack group-specific antigens are consid-ered nonpathogenic. Each serogroup includes many serotypes. The classification of the isolates of meningococcal serogroups into their serotypes is based on the differences in the proteins in the outer membrane and in the oligosaccharide part of LOS. For example, Group A meningococci has a single serotype, whereas group B and C meningococci consist of many serotypes. Serotyping of strains is useful for the identification of virulent strains for epidemio-logical studies.Pathogenesis and Immunity N. meningitidis colonizes the human nasopharynx, and under specific conditions, invades the blood stream and then reaches the brain, causing meningitis. Virulence factors N. meningitidis has three important virulence factors, which are responsible for causing disease. These are ( a) capsular polysac- charide, (b 26-4). polysaccharide: N. meningitidis is surrounded by a prominent polysaccharide capsule that is antiphagocytic. The capsule is an important virulence factor, which contrib-utes to the virulence by inhibiting phagocytosis. The capsule protects meningococci from destruction by the leukocytes. Inside the phagocytic vesicle of the leukocyte, they survive intracellular death, multiply, and then migrate to subepithe-lial spaces.LOS endotoxin: LOS endotoxin is present in the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. It is responsible for damage of the blood vessels associated with meningococcal infections. The endotoxin comprises two antigenic determinant compo-nents: (a) a protein component and (b) a carbohydrate compo-nent. The continuous production and release of endotoxin by N. meningitidis cause severe endotoxin reaction, seen in patients with meningococcal disease.IgA protease: IgA protease is the other important virulence factor. The enzyme acts by clearing the secretory IgA, thus help-ing the bacteria to attach to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. Pathogenesis of meningitis Initially, N. meningitidis causes a localized infection by coloniz- ing the nasopharynx. From this site, the meningococci invade the submucosa by circumventing the host defense mecha-nisms and gain access to the central nervous system (CNS). Meningococci reach CNS by the following ways: 1. Invasion of blood stream: This is the most common mode of spread of meningococci. Once inside the blood stream, the meningococci escape the immune surv eillance (e.g., antibodies, complement-mediated bacterial killing, 1. Gram-negative diplococci arranged in pairs. 2. On blood agar, produces convex, gray, and translucent colonies. 3. Oxidase test positive. 4. Catalase test positive. 5. Ferments glucose and maltose with production of acid. 6. Does not ferment sucrose or lactose.Box 26-2 Identifying features of Neisseria meningitidisVirulence factors Biological functions Capsule Prevents phagocytosis LOS endotoxin Causes damage of the blood vessels associated with meningococcal infections IgA protease Destroys IgA immunoglobulin, thereby helps gonococci to attach to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract Lipooligosaccharides Stimulates release of TNF-/H9251, which results in host phagocytosis) of the host and subsequently reach distant sites including the CNS. The specific mecha-nism by which the meningococci reach the subarachnoid space still remains to be clearly understood. 2. Direct contiguous spread: Meningococci can also reach the CNS by direct contiguous spread from naso-phar ynx. Inside CNS, the bacteria multiply and survive because host defense mechanisms (such as immuno-globulins, neutrophils, and complement) appear to have limited role in controlling multiplication of the bacte-ria. Uncontrolled multiplication of bacteria continues in the CSF, which subsequently causes a cascade of men-ingeal inflammation. Meningococcal infection of the nasopharynx is usually subclinical. Asymptomatic naso-pharyngeal carriage of meningococci is of short dura-tion and resolves within several weeks. In a few persons, meningococci invade the circulation and cause clinical disease. Host immunity The presence of meningococci in the nasopharynx induces a humoral antibody response, and most people acquire immunity to meningococcal disease by age of 20 years. Maternal antibodies provide protection to infants for the first 3-6 months of life. Later, colonization with nonpathogenic meningococci appears to produce cross-reacting, protective antibodies. Specific IgG antibodies are produced against meningococcal polysaccharides in combination with the complement medi-ate bactericidal activity against the meningococci. Individuals lacking the bactericidal antibodies and those suffering from complement deficiencies\u2014such as C5, C6, C7, or C8 compo-nents of the increased to meningococcal disease. An episode of meningitis confers group-specific immunity, but a second episode may be caused by another meningococcal serogroup. Clinical Syndromes N. meningitidis causes the following and other syndromes. Meningitis Meningococcal meningitis caused by N. meningitidis is most common in children and young adults. It is a febrile illness of short duration characterized by headache and stiff neck. Lethargy or drowsiness is frequent. Confusion, agitated delir-ium, and stupor are rarer. Mental obtundation, stupor, and coma due to increased intracranial pressure are some of the noted complications at the end stage of the disease. Prognosis of meningitis is good, and the patients recover completely on immediate treatment with appropriate antimi-crobial therapy. However, prognosis is bad in comatose patients and in patients with local neurological findings. Meningococcemia Meningococcemia with or without meningitis is a life-threatening condition. The condition presents as an acute fever with pete-chial rash. Small petechial rashes are continuously found on the trunk and lower extremities; subsequently the rashes may coalesce to form large hemorrhagic lesions. Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is an overwhelming sys- temic infection caused by N. meningitidis. This condition is characterized by severe disseminated intravascular coagula-tion, shock, and multisystem failure including destruction of adrenal glands. The condition, associated with circulatory collapse with intravascular coagulation, is invariably fatal. It is most commonly seen in persons suffering from deficiency of C5-C9 components of the complement. The vascular damage seen in this condition is caused primarily by the action of LOS endotoxin present in the meningococci. Other syndromes Nonsuppurative arthritis, usually of the knee joint, is seen in approximately 10% of the patients with meningococcal dis-ease. This condition is observed within the first 48 hours of treatment and is believed to be immunologically mediated. Recurrent meningococcal meningitis is another condi- tion which is associated with hereditary deficiency of various components of complement system. Other conditions include meningococcal pneumonia (which probably results from the aspiration of the organisms), septic arthritis, purulent pericarditis, and endophthalmitis. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Meningococcal disease occurs worldwide. N. meningitidis sero-group A usually causes epidemics, serogroup B causes both epidemics and outbreaks, while serogroup C mostly causes localized outbreaks. Endemic meningitis is more common in children below the age of 5 years and in elderly people. Large outbreaks of meningococcal disease have occurred in central African countries with attack rate as high as 400-500 cases per 100,000 population. Epidemics of meningococcal disease have occurred in many parts of the world. Meningococci of group A are associated with diseases in underdeveloped countries; meningococci of group B, C, or Y are responsible for most (90%) of the cases of meningococcal diseases in the developed countries (Table 26-5). Habitat N. meningitidis is primarily a pathogen of humans. Meningococci are found in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. Asymptomatic carriage of N. meningitidis varies from as low as 1% to as high as 40% in the population. The carriage rates are highest in school-going children, in young adults, and in the population with low economic status. Chap-26.indd 209 5/14/2012 1:30:31 PMSection III Chapter 26210 BACTERIOLOGY Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Human is the only reservoir of meningococcal infection. Nasopharyngeal secretion is the most common source of infec-tion. Meningococci are transmitted by airborne droplets of infected nasopharyngeal secretions (the most common source of infection). Family members living in crowded conditions or the people who live in close populations (such as military barracks and prisons) and older people are more susceptible to infection. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstration of meningo-cocci in clinical specimens by microscopy and culture. Specimens Cerebrospinal fluid and blood are the specimens of choice for demonstration of meningococci in the early stage of men-ingitis. Nasopharyngeal swabs are useful to detect carriers. The CSF is collected by lumbar puncture and blood by veni-puncture in strict aseptic conditions. CSF is never refrigerated as Haemophilus influenzae, another agent of meningitis, may die at the cold temperature. CSF specimens are transported immediately to laboratory for processing. Similarly, blood is collected in blood culture media containing either glucose broth or sodium taurocholate broth. Nasopharyngeal speci-mens are collected using sterile swabs and are transported in Stuart's transport medium to the laboratory. CSF Meningococcal meningitis produces various inflammatory changes in the CSF: The CSF in bacterial meningitis is more turbid. It contains more than 1000 WBC//H9262L, and the cells are pre-dominantly PMN cells. The total protein content is increased. The total glucose level, which is normally 60% of simultaneous blood glucose level, is lowered (hypoglycorrhachia). The intracranial pressure may be elevated. CSF received in the laboratory is processed in three parts: 1. First part is centrifuged and smear is prepared from the deposit for Gram st aining. The supernatant is tested for meningococcal antigens. 2. The second part of CSF is used for direct culture. 3. The third part is incubated overnight with an equal vol-ume of glucose bro th and then subcultured onto the blood agar and chocolate agar . Microscopy Gram staining of the CSF is a very useful method for detec-tion of meningococci. Meningococci are seen as Gram-negative diplococci present mainly inside the leukocytes and some may even be present extracellularly. These cocci can be demon-strated in the CSF in approximately 50% of the patients with meningococcal meningitis. In fulminant meningococcemia, Gram staining of the peripheral blood buffy coat may reveal Gram-negative diplococci. Culture Isolation of N. meningitidis from the CSF, blood, and other clinical specimens by culture confirms the diagnosis of menin-gococcal infection. The CSF is inoculated immediately on a nonselective medium, such as blood agar or chocolate agar, and incubated at 35-36\u00b0C under 5% 2 for 18-24 hours. The colo- nies of meningococci are small, round, translucent, and convex with a smooth glistening surface. Blood is inoculated immediately into blood culture bottles containing either glucose broth or sodium taurocholate broth and incubated at 35-36\u00b0C. Subcultures are made on blood agar or chocolate agar from these broths and are reincubated overnight at 35-36\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2. The cultures should be incubated for 4-7 days with daily subculture. Blood culture is often positive during early stage of meningitis and in meningococcemia. Other specimens Other specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and petechial exudates are processed in a similar way as described earlier for CSF. Identification of bacteria N. meningitidis are identified by the characteristics listed in Box 26-2. Serogrouping of the bacterial isolates grown on culture is car-ried out by slide agglutination with specific hyperimmune serum. Antigen detection Detection of soluble polysaccharide antigen in the CSF is a useful method for diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis. Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis, latex agglutination test, and bacterial coagglutination test using specific antibod-ies are the rapid tests frequently used to detect the soluble antigen in the CSF. Antigen detection is useful when bacteria are scanty in the CSF. However, antigen detection is not use-ful in the meningitis caused by Group B meningococci because N. meningitidis serogroup B is relatively nonimmunogenic and does not react with specific antibodies.Serogroups Disease A Meningococcal disease in underdeveloped countries B Meningitis and meningococcemia; most (/H1102290%) cases of meningitis in developed countries C Meningitis and meningococcemia; most (/H1102290%) cases of meningitis Serodiagnosis Indirect hemagglutination test and ELISA are useful for the demonstration of antibodies against specific polysaccharide antigen in the serum. Serodiagnosis is useful in the cases of chronic meningococcal infection where cultures have proved negative for meningococci. Molecular Diagnosis PCR has been used for detection of N. meningitidis DNA in clinical specimens. The test is useful to detect small amounts of meningococcal DNA in CSF. It is a more sensitive test for diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis than the culture. The high cost of the test and the expertise necessary to operate a PCR assay are the disadvantages of the test. The test, there-fore, is only used in a large-scale outbreak when a number of specimens are to be analyzed, and in a tertiary healthcare center. Treatment Prompt and specific antimicrobial therapy of meningococce-mia or meningococcal meningitis is most crucial. Intravenous penicillin G is the recommended drug for the treatment of meningococcal disease. The MIC of penicillin usually ranges from 0.01 to 0.05 /H9262 g/mL in treatment of bacterial meningitis. Ceftriaxone has an additional advantage of eradicating the nasopharyngeal car-riage of meningococci. Chloramphenicol is useful for patients who are allergic to penicillin. Meningococci are not susceptible to vancomycin and poly- myxin. Meningococci resistant to sulfadiazine (MIC /H113500.128 /H9262g/mL) have been documented recently. Prevention and Control This includes chemoprophylaxis and vaccines. Chemoprophylaxis Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is the key factor for preventing secondary cases of sporadic meningo-coccal disease. Person-to-person transmission can be inter-rupted by administration of antibiotics, which eradicate the asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier state. Sulfonamides, rifampin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are the drugs frequently used to eradicate meningococci from the nasopharynx. However, ciprofloxacin is not recommended for children, because it has been found to cause cartilage damage in immature experimental animals. Immunoprophylaxis Immunoprophylaxis by vaccination with group-specific menin-gococcal capsular polysaccharides of groups A, C, Y, and W135 meningococci is very much useful for prevention of meningo-coccal disease.Other Neisseria Species Other species of the genus Neisseria rarely cause human disease. They are found as part of normal bacterial flora mostly of the respiratory tract. These commensal pathogenic Neisseria species by following properties: They can grow on ordinary agar not enriched with blood and serum and they can also grow at 22\u00b0C. They do not require high percentage of CO2 for their growth. They produce greenish yellow or yellow colonies on the media. N. flavescens and N. sicca have been associated with isolated cases of meningitis, osteomyelitis, acute otitis media, and acute sinusitis. But true incidence of respiratory tract infection caused by these Neisseria species is not known. Most of these strains are susceptible to penicillins. N. lactamica is frequently isolated from the nasopharynx and is a nonvirulent Neisseria; however, it is closely related to patho-genic Neisseria. Neisseria catarrhalis\u2014which was later designated as Branhamella is now renamed as Moraxella catarrhalis\u2014is a com-mensal of the upper respiratory tract and, occasionally, is found in female genital tract. It is a recognized respiratory opportu-nistic pathogen in immunocompromised host and hospital-ized people. M. catarrhalis is multidrug resistant and grows on ordinary media, such as nutrient agar and MacConkey agar. It causes sinusitis, menin-gitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, sepsis, etc.) in immunocom-promised patients and in children. Some strains are susceptible to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline.Vaccines Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4): It has been shown to be highly effective in prevent- ing disease caused by A, C, Y, and W135 serogroups of meningo-cocci. The vaccine is given intramuscularly. Use of this vaccine is indicated for population at risk during outbreak of infection caused by one of these serogroups of meningococci. These vac-cines developed against group A, C, Y, and W135 are poorly immunogenic under 2 years of age. These vaccines, however, pro-duce good antibody response in children above 2 years of age.Tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conju-gate vaccine (MCV4): Recently, in 2005, MCV4 is being used for the persons aged 11-55 years for vaccination against menin-gococci in the United States. This is recommended for groups of population at risk, which include (a ) military recruits, (b ) travelers to areas hyperendemic or epidemic for meningococ-cal disease, (c ) patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, (d) patients with terminal complement deficiency, and (e ) microbiologists who are routinely exposed to meningococci. No vaccine against group B meningococci is available because group B meningococcal capsular antigen is not immunogenic. However, of late some progress has been made in preparation of vaccine for group B meningococci. The vaccine, which is at the experimental stage, consists of outer membrane proteins that are capable of inducing group-specific bactericidal antibodies.

Some corynebacteria are found as part of the normal flora of humans in the skin, upper respiratory tract, and urogenital tract. Corynebacteria (from the Greek words koryne, meaning club, and bacterion, meaning little rod) are Gram-positive, aerobic or facultative anaerobic, nonmotile, and catalase-positive rod-shaped have with arabinose, galactose, meso-diaminopimelic acid, and short-chain mycolic acids. They do not form spores or branch as do the actinomycetes, but they have the characteristic of forming irregular-shaped, club-shaped, or V-shaped arrange-ments in normal growth. Gram staining shows bacteria in short chains or clumps resembling characteristic Chinese letters. The genus Corynebacterium consists of 46 species, of which at least 30 species are known to be associated with human diseases. Corynebacterium species that can cause infections in humans are summarized in Table 27-1. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causal agent of the disease diphtheria is the most widely studied species. Nondiphtherial corynebacteria\u2014 collectively referred to as diphtheroids\u2014originally were believed to be mainly contaminants. These diphtheroids have recently been recognized as pathogenic, especially in immunocompro-mised hosts. Corynebacterium diphtheriae C. diphtheriae is the most important species causing diphtheria. Diphtheria is an acute upper respiratory tract illness character-ized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent membrane on the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. diphtheriae shows following features: C. diphtheriae is a Gram-positive bacillus showing maximum pleomorphism on Gram staining. The bacteria characteristically appear in palisades or as indi-vidual cells lying as sharp angles to each other in V and L formation. This Chinese letter pattern formation or cuneiform arrangement is caused by the incomplete separation of the daughter cells during division when the organism is grown on nutritionally inadequate media, such as coagulated egg medium or serum. The bacterium measures 3-6 /H11003 0.6-0.8 /H9262m and is slender and sometimes has swollen ends. Most of the bacteria have 2-3 granules at the swollen ends, which give reddish purple color when stained with Loeffler alkaline methylene blue. Rest of the bacterium is unevenly stained with the dye. Bacteria Diseases Corynebacterium diphtheriae Diphtheria (respiratory and cutaneous); diphtheria of other sites (external ear, the eye) and the genital mucosa; pharyngitis, and respiratory disease Corynebacterium jeikeium (group JK) Wound infections, septicemia, foreign body (catheter, prosthesis) infections, and endocarditis Corynebacterium urealyticum (group D2) Urinary tract infection Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis Native and prosthetic valve pseudodiphtheriticum Pneumonia, lung abscesses, tracheobronchitis, endocarditis, and lymphadenitisTABLE 12:01:05 PMSection III Chapter 27214 are known as metachromatic granules, Babe- Ernest's granules, or volutin granules. These granules, which are the accumulation of polymerized phosphates, are respon-sible for the beaded appearance of the bacteria. The granules can be demonstrated by special staining techniques, such as Albert stain, Neisser stain, and Ponder stain. They are nonmotile and nonsporing. Culture C. diphtheriae is an aerobic and facultative anaerobic organism but grows best under aerobic conditions. It grows at 37\u00b0C and at a pH of 7.2-7.4 on media enriched with blood, serum, or egg. 1. Loeffler's serum slope: Loeff ler's serum slope is an enriched medium frequently used for the growth of C. diphtheriae. The characteristic morphology of the bacte-ria is best seen on Loeffler's serum slope. The bacteria, on this medium, produce a luxuriant growth in 6-8 hours at a temperature of 37\u00b0C. Initially, the colonies are small, cir-cular, opaque, and white, but on prolonged incubation the colonies become larger in size and show a distinct yellow tint. Loeffler's serum slope does not support the growth of streptococci and pneumococci. 2. MacLeod's or Hoyle's tellurite blood agar media are the ex amples of selective media used for the culture of C. diphtheriae. Tellurite (0.04%) present in the media inhibits growth of other contaminant bacteria. Most strains of the bacteria require nicotinic and pantothenic acids for their growth; some also require thiamine, biotin, or pimelic acid. For the optimal production of diphtheria toxin, it is essential to supplement the medium with amino acids and a source of iron. On the tellurite agar, C. diphtheriae produces character-istic gray or black colored colonies after 48 hours of incuba-tion (Fig. 27-1, Color Photo 23). C. diphtheriae reduces tellurite to metallic tellurium, which is incorporated in the colonies, thereby giving them a characteristic gray or black color.C. diphtheriae is classified into three distinct biotypes (mitis, intermedius, gravis) based agar (Table 27-2): Mitis colonies are small, round, convex, and black. Intermedius colonies are small, flat, and gray. Gravis colonies are large, irregular, and gray. These morphological types of the strains were initially corre-lated with severity of the disease. Mitis strains were thought to produce mildest variety, gravis to produce the most serious disease, while the intermedius to produce the disease of inter-mediate severity, but now these distinctions are not considered valid. These morphological types, however, are useful for the epidemiological classification of C. diphtheriae isolates. Biochemical reactions C. diphtheriae shows the following reactions: diphtheriae ferments many sugars (glucose, galactose, malt-ose, and dextrin) producing acid but no gas. Hiss's serum water is always used for testing fermentation of sugars. The bacteria do not ferment lactose, mannitol, and sucrose. Some strains of virulent C. diphtheriae ferment sucrose. They do not hydrolyze urea or form phosphatase and they lack proteolytic activity. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Diphtheria bacilli are readily killed by heating at 58\u00b0C for 10 minutes and at 100\u00b0C for 1 minute. They are destroyed by the usual strengths of antiseptics. They are resistant to the action of FIG. 27-1.

Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall contains neuraminidase, arabinose, galactose, mannose, corynemycolic acid, and corynemycolenic acid. of the diphtheria bacilli are antigenically heterologous. Pathogenesis and Immunity Diphtheria is a classic example of toxin-mediated bacterial disease. Virulence factors Diphtheria toxin, the exotoxin produced by C. diphtheriae, is the key virulence factor of the bacteria (Table 27-3). Diphtheria toxin: Diphtheria toxin is produced only by strains of C. diphtheriae that are lysogenized with bacteriophages that contain the structural gene ( tox gene ) for the toxin molecule (tox /H11001 strains). When DNA of the phage becomes integrated into the genetic material of C. diphtheriae, the bacteria develop the capability of producing the polypeptide toxin. The gene for toxin production occurs on the chromosome of the prophage, but a bacterial repressor protein controls the expression of this gene. The repressor is activated by iron, and it is in this way that iron influences toxin production. High yields of toxin are synthesized only by lysogenic bacteria under conditions of iron deficiency. Key Points Diphtheria toxin is a powerful exotoxin, as little as 1-10 millionths (i.e., 0.0000001) of a gram can cause death in a guinea pig weighing 250 g in 96 hours. It is a protein with a molecular weight of 58,000 Da. It is synthesized in precursor form on membrane-bound polysomes in C. diphtheriae and is cotranslationally s ecreted as a single polypeptide chain made up of 535 amino acids. When released, the native toxin molecule is nontoxic until exposure of the active enzymatic site to mild trypsin treatment. The biologically active molecule consists of two function-ally distinct polypeptide chain fragments A (24,000-Da protein) and B (38,000-Da protein), linked by a disulfide bridge. Neither of the fragments are toxigenic on their own, but act together to cause toxigenicity. Intradermal inoculation of toxigenic culture or toxin causes local erythematous lesion within 48 hours. In animals, toxin causes congestion of adrenal glands with scattered hemorrhages in medulla or cortex or both. Regional lymph nodes as well as internal organs are also congested. Pathogenesis of diphtheria C. diphtheriae usually enters the body through the upper respiratory tract but can also enter through the skin, genital tract, or eye. Infection begins by adherence of the bacteria at the infected site. The initial lesion usually occurs on the tonsils and oropharynx, and from this site it may spread to the nasopharynx, larynx, and trachea. The organisms multiply rapidly in the epithelial cells, forming a local lesion and secrete exotoxins that cause necrosis of the cells in that area. The combination of cell debris and exudative inflammatory response (leading to accumulation of red blood cells, necrosed cells, bacteria, fibrin, and lymphocytes) result in the formation of the characteristic pseudomembrane. The pseu-domembrane of diphtheria is thick, leathery, grayish-blue or white. The membrane adheres very tenaciously to the underly-ing mucosa and if attempts are made to forcibly remove it, raw bleeding surface is exposed. Spreading of the membrane down the bronchial tree can occur, causing respiratory tract obstruction and dyspnea. Growth of C. diphtheriae is restricted to oral cavity, but toxemia and systemic manifestation of diphtheria occurs due to absorption of toxin from the site of membrane. The toxin binds to a specific receptor (now known as the HB-EGF receptor) present on susceptible cells and enters by receptor- mediated endocytosis (Fig. 27-2). Apparently as a result of activity on the endosomal membrane, the A subunit is cleaved and released from the B subunit. Fragment A then gains entry into the cell and catalyzes ADP ribosylation. This leads to the inhibition of the NAD in protein synthesis. Ultimately, inac-tivation of all the host cell EF-2 molecules causes cell death, which clinically manifests as the necrotic lesion of diphtheria. Diphtheria toxin: Causes local tissue destruction at the site of membrane for-mation (the upper respiratory tract), facilitating replication and transmission. Is also absorbed into the blood stream and distributed, resulting in systemic complications of diphtheria including demyelinating peripheral neuritis and myocarditis.

Host immunity In diphtheria, immunity against clinical diseases depends on the presence of antitoxin in the blood stream, in response to clinical or subclinical disease or active immunization. Infants below 6 months of age carry IgG antibodies derived from the immune mother either transplacentally or through breast-feeding. The antibodies later developed are IgG and IgA type. In areas where diphtheria is endemic and mass immunization is not practiced, most young children are highly susceptible to infection. Individuals who have fully recovered from diphtheria may con- tinue to harbor the organisms in the throat or nose for weeks or even months. In the past, it was mainly through such healthy car-riers that the disease was spread, and toxigenic bacteria were main-tained in the population. The immune status of the individuals is assessed by the presence of antitoxin levels or by Schick's test.Schick's test: Schick's test was introduced by Schick in 1913 to assess the immunity among children. The test is performed by injecting 0.1 mL of highly purified toxin (1/50 minimum lethal dose) into one forearm and 0.1 mL of heat-inactivated toxin into another forearm as a control. This brings about four types of reactions: (a) positive reaction, (b) negative reaction, (c) pseudoimmunereaction, and (d) combined reaction. 1. Positive reaction: This is characterized by a local inflam-mator y reaction that reaches maximum intensity in 4-7 days in the test arm and then reduces gradually. This indi-cates absence of immunity to C. diphtheriae. 2. Negative reaction: Absence of an y inflammatory reac- tion is suggestive of a negative reaction. This indicates the presence of antitoxin in the individual, which neutralizes the toxin injected. Such an individual is immune to C. diphtheriae infection. 3. Pseudoimmunereaction: In endemic areas, allergy to the toxin is seen among children and adults. Ev en though the individual is immune, yet an allergic reaction is observed in both the test as well as the control arm. The inflamma-tory reaction reaches its peak in 36 hours and subsides in 72 hours in both the arms. This reaction is called pseu-doimmune reaction and it indicates that the individual is immune but hypersensitive. 4. Combined reaction: This is the condition in which an individual injected with the to xin develops inflamma- tion in the test arm, which increases in intensity by 4-7 days. In the control arm, the inflammation is seen for a maximum of 48-72 hours and then subsidies. It indicates the individual is not immune and is hypersensitive. Clinical Syndromes The clinical manifestations of diphtheria depend upon the following: (a) immune status of the patient, ( b) virulence of the bacteria, and (c) the site of the infection. Toxigenic strains (tox /H11001) of C. diphtheriae cause: Serious, sometimes fatal, disease in nonimmune patients. Mild respiratory diseases in partially immune patients. Asymptomatic colonization in fully immune individuals. Nontoxigenic strains (tox /H11002) cause a mild disease, such as cutaneous diphtheria. Respiratory diphtheria Incubation period varies from 2 to 5 days. Sore throat, in the absence of systemic complaints, is the usual initial symptom. Fever, if occurs, is usually lower than 102\u00b0F, and malaise, dysphagia, and headache are frequently present. Respiratory diphtheria is: Characterized by the formation of a fibrinous pseudomem-brane on the palate, pharynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and may extend to the tracheobronchial tree. The pseudo-membrane is generally a firmly adherent, thick, fibrinous, gray-brown membrane. This membrane may cause bleeding if disturbed. Respiratory distress may occur if the membrane breaks loose and occludes the airways. Associated with marked edema of the tonsils, uvula, submandibular region, and anterior neck (bull neck). Complications of respiratory diphtheria include the following: Myocarditis\u2014the main complication, which may occur in as many as two-thirds of the patients. Circulatory collapse, heart failure, atrioventricular blocks, and dysrhythmias may also occur. Involvement of the cranial nerves (leading to paralysis of the soft palate with resultant difficulty in swallowing and nasal regurgitation of the fluids) and polyneuritis of the lower extremities. Recovery is complete in both cases. Cutaneous diphtheria Cutaneous diphtheria is generally caused by nontoxigenic strains (tox/H11002 strains) of C. diphtheriae. The condition is an indolent nonprogressive infection characterized by a superfi-cial, nonhealing ulcer with a gray-brown membrane. The con-dition may occur at one or more sites\u2014usually confined to the areas with previous mild trauma or bruising. Extremities are affected more often than the trunk or head. Pain, tender-ness, erythema, and exudate are the typical presentations. Respiratory tract colonization or symptomatic infection and toxic complications occur in a minority of patients with cuta-neous diphtheria. Cutaneous diphtheria may persist for weeks to months. Cutaneous diphtheria often causes no toxicity while producing natural immunity; however, it may cause epidemics in poorly immunized populations. Diphtheria of other sites External ear, eye (usually the palpebral conjunctivae), and genital mucosa are the other sites of diphtheria. Rare sporadic cases of endocarditis usually due to nontoxigenic strains have been reported. Septicemia caused by C. diphtheriae is rare but is invariably fatal. Chap-27.indd 216 5/14/2012 12:01:06 PMSection III Chapter 27CORYNEBACTERIUM 217 Epidemiology Geographical distribution During the early 1990s, diphtheria was still endemic in many parts of the world including the Indian subcontinent, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Nigeria, and republics of the former Soviet Union. The largest outbreak of diphtheria in the developed world occurred from 1990 to 1996 throughout the states of the former Soviet Union. Most cases were reported among adolescents and adults, rather than children. More than 110,000 cases of diphtheria and 2900 fatalities from diph-theria were reported during the epidemic. Incidence declined in 1996, possibly due to immunization and early detection activities that were carried out following the outbreak. Outbreaks have also been reported in Central Asia, Algeria, and Ecuador. In the United States, Europe, and Eastern Europe, recent outbreaks of diphtheria have occurred largely among alcohol and/or drug abusers. Since 1994, with the advent of active immunization procedures, case fatality due to diphtheria has reduced significantly. Habitat The upper respiratory tract of an infected host is the primary habitat of C. diphtheriae. The bacteria also inhabit the superfi-cial layers of the skin lesions. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the only natural host of C. diphtheriae and thus are the only significant reservoirs of infection. Infective droplets or nasopharyngeal secretions are the common sources of infection. Direct human contact facilitates transmission of the disease. Patients with active infection are more likely to transmit diphtheria. C. diphtheriae is most commonly transmitted by close contacts through droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions or infected skin lesions. It is known that toxigenic strains may directly colonize the nasopharyngeal cavity. In addition, the tox gene can be spread indirectly by the release of toxigenic corynebacterio-phage and by lysogenic conversion of nontoxigenic autoch-thonous C. diphtheriae in situ. Asymptomatic respiratory carrier states are believed to be important in transmitting diphtheria and immunization appears to reduce the likeli-hood of carrier state. Dust and clothing also may contrib-ute to the transmission. The organism can survive up to 6 months in dust and fomites. When diphtheria was endemic, the disease was most commonly seen in children younger than 15 years, but recently, the epide-miology has shifted to adults because this group of population lacked natural exposure to toxigenic C. diphtheriae in the vaccine era and also received less booster doses. In serosurvey in the United States and other developed countries, such as Sweden, Italy, and Denmark, 25% to more than 60% of adults did not show protective antitoxin levels in their serum with particularly low levels found in elderly persons. Typing C. diphtheriae strains are classified into various serotypes by agglutination reactions. Mitis strains have been classified into 40 types, intermedius into 4 types, and gravis into 13 types. Gravis type II strains are found worldwide, while types I and III are commonly found in Great Britain. Type IV is mainly found in Egypt, while type V in the United States. Typing of C. diphtheriae strains can also be done by biotyping, lysotype, and by using molecular biology techniques. The latter includes techniques, such as restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of C. diphtheriae chromosomal DNA and genetic probe for cloned corynebacterial insertion sequences. Laboratory Diagnosis Initial treatment of diphtheria is based on the high clinical suspicion or the clinical diagnosis of the condition. Treatment is started without waiting for the result of the laboratory test because definitive results take as long as a week. Hence, laboratory diagnosis is carried out not for treatment of individual cases, but for the epidemiological purposes and for the initiation of control measures of the disease. Specimens These include swabs from the nose, throat, pieces of pseu-domembrane, if possible even from beneath the membrane, biopsy tissue, etc. At least two swabs from the infected site are obtained. The first swab is used to make a direct smear and the other is used for the culture. The specimens are collected as soon as possible when diphtheria is suspected, even if treatment with antibiotics has been started. These are then transported to the laboratory in a sterile empty container or in silica gel sachets for immediate processing. Microscopy Gram staining of the smear shows Gram-positive bacilli. Albert, Neisser, or Ponder stain of direct smears shows metachromatic granules (Fig. 27-3). However, diphtheria bacilli may not always be demonstrated in the smears, and also it may be difficult to differentiate the bacilli from those of commensal corynebac-teria frequently found in the throat. Hence, staining of the smears alone is not specific to C. diphtheriae. The smear exami-nation, however, is valuable to identify Vincent's and fusiform bacilli, the causative agents of Vincent's angina. Culture Culture of specimens for C. diphtheriae is essential to confirm the diagnosis of diphtheria. The specimens are inoculated on nonselective media (e.g., blood agar) as well as on selective Chap-27.indd 217 5/14/2012 III Chapter 27218 Hoyle, Mueller, or Tinsdale medium). Tellurite medium is very useful for isolation of C. diphtheriae from contacts, carriers, and convalescents, in which clinical specimens contain a number of other bacteria. The bacteria on tellurite medium produce characteristic black to grayish black colored colonies after 48 hours of incubation. On Loeffler's serum slope, C. diphtheriae grows after 4-6 hours at 37\u00b0C producing small, circular, and white opaque colonies. If no colonies are seen, the medium is reincubated further for 24 hours. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of C. diphtheriae colonies are summa- rized in Box 27-1. C. be identified as mitis, intermedius, or gra-vis biotype on the basis of their (a) growth characteristics on tellurite medium, (b) carbohydrate fermentation patterns, and (c) hemolysis on sheep blood agar plates. Potentially More recently, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) probes have been designed for the identification of genus and species of corynebacteria. Toxigenicity testing All strains of C. diphtheriae are tested for production of toxins. Production of toxins can be demonstrated by the following tests: 1. In vivo test (a) Subcutaneous test (b) Intradermal test 2. In vitro test (a) Elek's gel precipitation test (b) Tissue culture test 3. Molecular diagnosis In vivo test Subcutaneous test: In this test, growth from over night culture of C. diphtheriae on Loeffler's slope is emulsified in 2-4 mL broth. Two guinea pigs are injected subcutaneously with 0.8 mL of the emulsion. One of these is protected with 500 U of diphtheria antitoxin, which is injected intraperitoneally before 18-24 hours of the test. The other guinea pig is not protected. If the strain is virulent, the unprotected animal will die within 4 days, showing the typical findings. The protected guinea pig shall remain normal without showing any sign of toxemia.Intradermal test: In this test, 0.2 mL of the emulsion obtained from 18 hours' growth of test bacteria cultured on Loeffler's serum slope is injected intradermally into shaven sites of two albino guinea pigs (or rabbits), so that each animal receives 0.1 mL into two different sites. The control animal is given 500 U of antitoxin the previous day. The other is given 50 U of antitoxin intraperitoneally 4 hours after the skin test, in order to prevent death. Toxigenicity is indicated by an inflammatory reaction at the site of injection progressing to necrosis in 48-72 hours in the test animal, and there is no change in the control animal. This method is advantageous, since large number of strains can be tested simultaneously and also the animals do not die. In vitro test Elek's gel precipitation test: The Elek's test is an immuno-precipitation test for demonstration of biological activity of the toxin, initially described in 1949. It is an in vitro neutralization reaction between toxin and antitoxin. The test is performed on a Petri dish containing horse serum agar. A rectangular strip of filter paper impregnated with diphtheria antitoxin (1000 IU/mL) is placed across the medium before the medium is solidified. The strain of C. diphtheriae to be tested for toxicity is streaked on the medium at right angles to the filter paper strip. A known toxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae (positive controls) and nontoxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae (negative control) are also inoculated along with the test strain at right angles to the strip. The plate is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 hours. After incubation, the toxin produced by the growth of the test strain diffuses into the agar and meets the antitoxin at the optimal concentration, and the line of precipitation can be seen. In strains that are negative, no precipitin lines are seen. FIG. 27-3. Albert-stained bacilli showing a Chinese letter pattern formation or cuneiform arrangement. 2.

F erment serum sugars, such as glucose, galactose, maltose, and dextrin, producing acid but no gas. 4. Demonstrate cystinase, but not pyrazinamidase activity. 5. Toxins are demonstrated by in viv o tests (e.g., subcutaneous and intradermal tests in guinea pigs) and in vitro test (e.g., Elek's gel precipitation test).Box 27-1 Tissue culture test: Many eukaryotic cell lines (e.g., African green monkey kidney, Chinese hamster ovary) are sensitive to diphtheria toxin, enabling in vitro tissue culture tests to be used for detection of toxin production. The toxigenicity of diphtheria bacilli is demonstrated by incorporating strains in agar overlay of cell culture monolayers. The toxin produced by the bacteria diffuses into the cells below and kills the cells in the monolayer. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): It is a useful test to detect toxigenic strain of C. diphtheriae directly in a clinical specimen. The assay allows detection of the diphtherial toxin gene (TOX) in the bacteria. Added advantage of the PCR is that it can detect nonviable C. diphtheriae organisms in speci-mens collected after starting of antibiotic therapy. The test, however, is available only in a few laboratories abroad. Treatment Treatment should be started immediately after the clinical diagnosis of diphtheria. Treatment of diphtheria is based on: 1. Antitoxin therapy and 2. Antibiotics therapy Antitoxin therapy Diphtheria antitoxin: It is the mainstay of therapy in diph- theria. Diphtheria antitoxin is a hyperimmune antiserum produced in horses, which is administered to neutralize the toxin responsible for diphtheria. The antitoxin neutralizes only free toxin before the toxin enters the cells, but is ineffective after toxin has entered into the cell. The dosage of antitoxin is dependent on the site of infection, patient's clinical picture, and duration of illness. The antise-rum appears to be more effective in less severely ill patients and in those who are treated earlier in the course of their disease. Therefore, more severely ill patients and those with longer duration of symptoms are given higher doses than those with less severe disease of shorter duration. The dosage recommended is 20,000-100,000 U depending on the severity of the infection. The antitoxin is usually adminis-tered by the intravenous route with infusion over 30-60 minutes. Antitoxin appears to be of no value in treatment of cutane-ous diphtheria. The antitoxin is also not recommended for treatment of asymptomatic carriers. Antibiotics therapy Antimicrobial therapy is useful in treatment of diphtheria. Antibiotics: Limit the production of toxin, Eradicate diphtheria bacteria from infected hosts, and Prevent transmission of the bacteria to patient contacts.Penicillin and erythromycin are the only antibiotics recommended for treatment. Both antibiotics are equally effective in resolving fever and local symptoms; however, erythromycin has been shown to be marginally superior in eradicating the carrier state. Antibiotic therapy, however, is not a substitute for antitoxin therapy. Elimination of the bacteria is demonstrated by at least two successive negative nose and throat cultures or skin cul-ture obtained 24 hours' apart, after the completion of the therapy. Treatment with erythromycin is repeated if culture results remain positive. Prevention and Control Active immunization Active immunization by vaccination with diphtheria tox-oid is the key in preventing diphtheria. Vaccines consist of microorganisms or cellular components that act as antigens. Administration of the vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies with specific protective properties. Serum antitoxin concentration of 0.01 IU/mL is usually accepted as the minimum protective level, and 0.1 IU/mL provides a definitely protective level. Vaccination is important, especially for high-risk groups (such as children, elderly individuals, and immigrants from areas of continued endemic infections). Active immunization by vaccination increases resistance to C. diphtheriae infection. Vaccines consist of microorganisms or cellular components that act as antigens. Vaccines DTP vaccines: It is typically combined with tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis (triple DTaP vaccine) and is the vaccine of choice for children aged 6 weeks to 6 years. Alum-adsorbed combination toxoid vaccine against diphtheria is available. There are three types of preparation: 1. DTP (with tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine). 2. DTaP (with tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine). 3. DT and Dt (with tetanus toxoid for adult and pediatric use, respectiv ely). Diphtheria to xoid is prepared by treating the exotoxin with formaldehyde. This treatment inactivates the toxic effects but maintains the antigenicity. Alum is used as an adsorbent, which also acts as an adjuvant and increases the immunogenic-ity of the vaccines. The vaccine in children and adults is usu-ally administered in the deltoid or mid-lateral thigh muscles. Preferred site of administration in infants is the lateral part of the thigh. The schedule of primary immunization for infants and children consists of: The first three doses of DTP be separated by a minimum of 4 weeks. The fourth dose, given 1 year after the third dose. A booster dose, given at the age of 4-6 years. A booster dose once in every 10 years is also recommended. Chap-27.indd 219 5/14/2012 12:01:07 PMSection III Chapter 27220 BACTERIOLOGY Passive immunization Passive immunization is carried out by antidiphtheric serum (ADS). This consists of administration of 500-1000 U of ADS given subcutaneously, and ADS is usually recom-mended as emergency measure for treatment of susceptible persons. It is most effective in reducing the fatality rate. The long half-life of specific antitoxin in the circulation is an important factor in ensuring effective neutralization of diph-theria toxin. However, to be effective, the antitoxin must react with the toxin before it becomes internalized into the cell. Combined immunization Combined immunization is carried out by simultaneous administration of ADS and diphtheria toxoid. The ADS is given in one arm, while the toxoid is given in the other arm, followed by a complete schedule of vaccination with toxoid. Other Pathogenic CorynebacteriumSpecies Corynebacterium ulcerans C. ulcerans usually causes skin infections but occasionally is associated with diphtheria-like lesions, such as pharyngitis and respiratory disease. It resembles C. diphtheriae gravis type, but differs from it by ( nitrate to ulcerans produces two types of toxins: one resembles that of C. diphtheriae and other resem-bling that of C. pseudotuberculosis. C. ulcerans is also pathogenic for animals. The bacteria can cause infection in cows, and it can be transmitted to humans through milk. Antidiphtheria toxin con-fers protection against the infection caused by C. ulcerans. Corynebacterium jeikeium (Group JK) C. jeikeium can colonize the skin of healthy people. Patients with prolonged hospitalization, neutropenia, or on a prolonged course of antibiotics are more susceptible to colonization by the bacteria. C. jeikeium is an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients with hematological disorders or intravascular catheters. The bacteria enter through the catheters and cause infections in the immunocompromised patients. In these patients, it causes septicemia, foreign body (catheter, prosthesis) infections, and endocarditis. The bacterium is very resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Corynebacterium urealyticum (Group D2) C. urealyticum is an important agent of the urinary tract infection. Group D2 has been reported to cause chronic or recurrent cystitis, bladder stones, and pyelonephritis. People with prior urinary tract abnormalities or recent urologic procedures are at highest risk for this disease. These bacteria produce large quantities of the enzyme urease, which splits urea, producing ammonia, thereby making the urine alkaline. This leads to the formation of struvite calculi or stones. These bacteria are increasingly found in patients with immunosuppression, underlying genitourinary disorders, and in those receiving antibiotic therapy. Corynebacterium riegelii, Corynebacterium amycolatum, and Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum are Corynebacterium species associated with urinary tract infections. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis C. pseudotuberculosis is closely related to C. diphtheriae and is also pathogenic for animals especially livestock. C. pseudotuberculosis is reported to be normal inhabitant of the anterior nares and skin. The bacteria colonize more on the skin of the immuno-compromised patients than the healthy persons. In immu-nocompromised hosts, C. pseudotuberculosis is associated with both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, pneumonia, lung abscesses, tracheobronchitis, and suppurative lymph-adenitis. Antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics is also more common in isolates from immunosuppressed patients. Corynebacterium haemolyticum C. haemolyticum causes as many as 10% of all pharyngitis cases in patients between 10 and 30 years. The bacteria produce an extracellular toxin that causes an erythrogenic rash associated with the pharyngitis. Corynebacterium striatum C. striatum is found on catheters in patients with neutropenia and malignancies. The bacterium causes respiratory tract infec-tions and foreign body infections. A case of meningitis caused by C. striatum has also been reported recently. Diphtheroids Other Corynebacterium species resembling C. diphtheriae may sometimes be mistaken for diphtheria bacilli and are called diphtheroids or nondiphtherial corynebacteria. Diphtheroids are found as commensals in the skin, throat, conjunctiva, and other areas. They are present widely in For adults and in children older than 7 years, a lower dose of diphtheria toxoid (Td) is the vaccine of choice and primary series comprises of three doses. The vaccine: Decreases local tissue spread of C. diphtheriae, Prevents toxic complications, Diminishes transmission of C. diphtheriae Provides herd immunity when at least 70-80% of a population is immunized. However, the vaccine does not prevent subsequent respiratory or cutaneous carriage of toxigenic C. diphtheriae.

Only recently, the role of these organisms in causing human infec-tions has been recognized. The most common diphtheroids include Corynebacterium xerosis found in human conjuctival sac, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum found in human throat; also, these are found to be associated with human infections. Differences between C. diphtheriae and diphthe-roids are summarized in Table 27-4. Other Coryneform Besides genus Corynebacterium, other genera of irregularly shaped, Gram-positive bacteria have been identified to colonize and cause disease in humans. The other coryneform genera include Arcanobacterium, with wound infection, pharyngitis, and less commonly septicemia and endo-carditis. Use of penicillin or erythromycin has proved effective. Oerskovia is found in the soil and in decaying organic matter. The bacteria can cause septicemia, endocarditis, meningitis, and soft tissue infections. It shows a high degree of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Brevibacterium has been found to colonize the skin of humans. The organism has been associated with malodor-ous feet in some colonized people, septicemia, osteomyelitis, and foreign body infection. These bacteria show resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as erythromycin, cipro-floxacin, and clindamycin. Tetracycline, gentamicin, and vancomycin have shown to be effective. Turicella colonize the ears of the persons infected with Turicella and also of healthy persons. These organisms are resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin but are sensitive to ciprofloxacin and clindamycin.Characteristics diphtheriae Diphtheroids Metachromatic granules Present Few or absent Staining property Uniformly stained More uniformly stained Arrangement Cuneiform arrangement Parallel rows Culture Grows on enriched media Grows on ordinary medium Sugar fermentation Negative Positive Toxins Produce toxins Do not produce toxins with few exceptions An 8-year-old child was admitted to hospital with low-grade fever (/H11021100\u00b0F), malaise, dysphagia, and headache. Examination revealed a fibrinous membrane on the pharynx. A pair of swab collected from the membrane was sent to microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The child was administered antitoxin by the intrave-nous route and treated with antibiotics. Subsequently, 3 days later the report from the laboratory confirmed isolation of a toxigenic C. diphtheriae from the specimen. Why treatment for diphtheria was started immediately without waiting for the confirmatory report? What are the tests performed in a microbiology laboratory to demonstrate C. diphtheriae in clinical specimens? Are nontoxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae capable of causing disease in humans?CASE STUDY Chap-27.indd 221 5/14/2012 12:01:07 PM28 Introduction The consists of rod-shaped Gram-positive bacteria that form endospores. The family includes two main groups of spore-forming bacteria: The anaerobic spore-forming bacteria of the The aerobic or facultatively anaerobic spore-forming bacte- ria of the genus Bacillus. The genus Bacillus is frequently known as aerobic spore bearers. They are ubiquitous and are present in soil, dust, air, and water. These bacteria are also frequently isolated as contaminants in bacteriological culture media. The genus Bacillus consists of more than 50 species. Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus are the two most important species that cause infections in humans and animals. B. anthracis causes anthrax, while B. cereus causes food poisoning. The human infections caused by Bacillus spe- cies are summarized in Table 28-1. Bacillus anthracis B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, has a worldwide distribution. Anthrax is caused by inhalation, skin exposure, or by gastrointestinal (GI) absorption. Use of anthrax as a bio-logical warfare agent is an additional concern now. B. anthra- cis is of considerable historical interest due to the following reasons: 1. It was the first pathogenic bacterium to be seen under microscope. 2. It was the first bacterium shown to be the cause of a dis-ease. It was from studies on anthrax that Koch est ablished his famous postulates in 1876. In 1877, Robert Koch grew the organism in pure culture, demonstrated its ability to form endospores, and produced experimental anthrax by injecting it into animals. 3. It was the first bacterium to be isolated in pure culture and shown to possess spores. F or the first time, spores were discovered from B. anthracis and Bacillus subtilis by Koch and Cohn and they established the germ theory of disease. 4. It was the first bacterium used for the preparation of attenuated vaccine by Louis Pasteur . Properties of the Bacteria Morphology B. anthracis morphological features: B. anthracis is a Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus. It is a very large bacillus measuring 1-1.2 /H9262m in width and 3-5 /H9262m in length. In smears from infected tissues, the bacteria are found as single, in pairs, and in short chains, the entire chain being surrounded by a capsule. In culture, B. anthracis grows as long chains and may appear similar to streptobacilli. In these chains, the bacilli are arranged end-to-end and the ends of the bacilli are t runcated, not rounded, or often concave and somewhat swollen. This gives the chain of bacilli a \"bamboo-stick\" appearance (Fig. 28-1). It is capsulated. The bacterium forms the capsule only when grown on nutrient agar containing 0.7% sodium bicarbon-ate in the presence of 5-20% carbon dioxide. The capsule Bacillus Bacteria Diseases Bacillus anthracis Anthrax (cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalational) and septicemia, Gastroenteritis Other Bacillus species Opportunistic infectionsTABLE 28-1Human caused by Bacillus speciesAmorphouscapsular materialBoxcar appearance Endospore Bacillus anthracis arranged in chains FIG. 28-1. A schematic diagram of Bacillus anthracis arranged in chains. Chap-28.indd 222 5/14/2012 1:29:39 PMSection III Chapter 28BACILLUS 223 is polypeptide (polymer of D-glutamic acid) in nature. It protects the bacteria against leukocytic phagocytosis and lysis. It is usually formed in the tissues but are absent when grown in ordinary conditions of culture. It is easily visual-ized using a methylene blue or India ink stain. Production of the capsule is mediated by a 60-megadalton plasmid, pX02. Therefore, the transfer of this plasmid to noncapsu-lated B. anthracis by transduction makes the recipient strain capsulated. It is nonmotile and nonacid fast. Anthrax spores: Gram staining of B. anthracis shows the characteristic squared ends with spores as unstained spaces. Anthrax spores are oval, central in position, and are refractile. They are of the same width as the bacillary body and so they do not cause bulging of vegetative cell. The anthrax spore consists of (a) central protoplast, (b) cortex, and (c) spore coat. The central protoplast or germ cell of the spore carries the constituents of the future vegetative cell. It also consists of dipicolinic acid, which is responsible for the heat resistance property of the spore. The cortex that surrounds the protoplast consists largely of peptidoglycan (murein), which is responsible for protecting the spore from radiation and heat. The cortical membrane, or protoplast wall, becomes the cell wall of the new vegeta-tive cell when the spore germinates. The spore coats, which constitute up to 50% of the volume of the spore, protect it from chemicals, enzymes, etc. The spores are highly refractile and are resistant to staining, heat, cold, radiation, desiccation, and disinfectants. Spores are formed in culture or in soil under unfavorable conditions for growth. Anthrax spores need oxygen for sporulation. These germinate when exposed to a nutrient-rich condition, such as the tissues or blood of an animal or human host. Rainfall stimulates anthrax spore germination, while flies and vultures spread the spores. Spore formation is facilitated by: (a) nitrogen and organic soil content, (b) environmental pH greater than 6, (c) the ambient temperature greater than 15\u00b0C, (d) 2% sodium chloride, and (e) the presence of distilled water. Spore formation is inhibited by calcium chloride. Spores are nev er found in host tissues unless the infected body fluids are exposed to ambient air. Culture B. anthracis is an aerobe and facultative anaerobe. The bacteria grow at a temperature range of 12-45\u00b0C, optimum tempera-ture being 37\u00b0C. They grow on a wide range of media including ordinary nutrient media and several selective media.1. Nutrient agar: On nutrient after 24 hours of B. anthracis produces grayish and granular colonies measuring 2-3 mm in diameter. Under low-power microscopy, the edges of the colony appear as long, interlacing chains of bacilli, resembling locks of matted hair, which gives them a \"medusa head\" appearance with an uneven surface and wavy margin.2. Blood agar: On horse or sheep blood agar, B. anthracis colonies are gray or white, typically nonhemolytic, with a dry, ground-glass appearance. The colonies are at least 3 mm in diameter and sometimes have tails.3. Solid medium containing penicillin: B. anthracis on a solid medium containing 0.05-0.5 U of penicillin/mL produces large, spherical colonies within 3-6 hours and occurs in chains on the surface of the agar, resembling a string of pearls. This property is known as string of pearls reaction and is useful in differentiation of B. anthracis from B. cereus and other aerobic spore bearers.4. Gelatin medium: In a gelatin stab, there is growth down the stab line with lateral spikes, longer near the surface, giving an 'inverted fir tree' appearance. The process of liquefaction is slow and late, which occurs after 7 days at 20\u00b0C and starts at the surface (Fig. Polymyxin B-lysozyme-EDTA- thallous acetate (PLET) agar medium is a selective medium used for isolation of B. anthracis from mixtures containing other spore-bearing bacilli. The medium is composed of heart ethylene diamine acetate. Production of capsular material is associated with the formation of a characteristic mucoid or \"smooth\" (S) colony type. Capsulated bacteria on serum or bicarbonate medium produce smooth or mucoid colonies. Smooth variants that form capsule are virulent strains of B. anthracis. Rough (R) variants that lack capsule are relatively avirulent. Biochemical reactions B. anthracis shows the following reactions: B. produces acid from glucose, maltose, sucrose, tre-halose dextrin, but not from or D-mannitol. They reduce nitrate to nitrite.

Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Bacillus vegeta- tive forms are susceptible to moist heat; they are killed at 60\u00b0C in 30 minutes. Bacillus spores are resistant to hostile physical and chemical conditions, ranging from desert sands and hot springs to Arctic soils and from fresh waters to marine sediments. They remain viable at temperatures, pH values, and salt concentra-tions at which few other organisms could survive. In the dry state and in certain soils, the spores may survive for 50 years or more. They survive in 5% phenol for weeks. The spores are killed by moist heat at 100\u00b0C in 60 minutes. They are also killed by 4% (w/v) formaldehyde or 4% (w/v) potassium permanganate in a few minutes.Duckering: Destruction of the spores in animal products is achieved by duckering. Duckering is a procedure that was used to reduce anthrax spores in wool below critical infection level without destroying the animal hairs and bristles. In this pro-cedure, 2% formaldehyde is used at 30-40\u00b0C for 20 minutes for disinfection of wool, while 0.25% formaldehyde solution is used at 60\u00b0C for 6 hours for disinfection of animal hair and bristles. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Properties Antigenic properties Three types of antigens are present in anthrax bacillus. These are:Capsular antigen: Capsular antigen is present in virulent capsulated strains of B. anthracis. Antibodies against capsular antigen are not protective.Cell wall antigen: Cell wall antigen is present in the cell wall and is made up of N-acetylglucosamine and D-galactose. It cross-reacts with blood group A antigen and with capsular polysaccharide of type 14 Pneumococcus. The antibody against the cell wall antigen is not protective.Somatic antigen: Somatic antigen is a heat-labile protein present in bacterial body. It stimulates immune system to produce antibodies, which are protective in nature. Pathogenesis and Immunity Virulence factors Virulence of B. anthracis (Table 28-2) depends on the (a) bacte-rial capsule and (b) anthrax toxin complex.Bacterial capsule: The poly- D-glutamyl capsule itself is nontoxic. The capsule, however, protects the organism against the bactericidal components of serum and phagocytes, and against phagocytic engulfment. It plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of anthrax. It plays most important role during the establishment of the infection. It plays a less significant role in the terminal phases of the disease, which are mediated by anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin complex: Anthrax toxin is an exotoxin and a protein in nature. Anthrax toxin complex comprises three components: (a) protective antigen (PA), (b) edema factor (EF), and (c) lethal factor (LF).Protective antigen: The PA is an 82.7 kDa protein. It is called PA because antibodies against this antigen are protective against the action of anthrax toxin. The PA is the binding (B) domain of anthrax toxin and is necessary for entry of the bacteria into the host cell. The antigen binds to cell receptors within a target tissue. Once bound, a fragment is cleaved free to expose an addi-tional binding site. This additional site can combine with EF to form edema toxin or with LF to form lethal toxin.Edema factor: Edema factor is an 88.9 kDa protein. It is a component of the edema toxin. It is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase, which converting adenosine triphos-phate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This causes an increase in the cellular cAMP levels, leading to cellular edema within the target tissues. The edema factor also causes inhibition of neutrophil function and lowers the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by monocytes.Lethal factor: LF zinc metallopro- tease that inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinase, leading Virulence factors Biological functions Bacterial capsule Protects anthrax bacilli against leukocytic phagocytosis and lysis; if engulfed, resist killing and digestion Anthrax toxin complex Anthrax toxin complex is plasmid-encoded and comprises of the following three proteins Protective antigen (PA) Entry of the bacilli into the host cell. Binds the complex to receptors on macrophage surface Edema factor (EF) Causes cellular edema within the target tissue and also inhibits neutrophil function. Blocks adenyl cyclase pathway within cells Lethal factor (LF) Release of tumor necrosis factor-/H9251 and interleukin-1 by macrophagesTABLE III Chapter the inhibition of intracellular signaling. It stimulates the release of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) by macrophages. This mechanism is thought to contribute to sudden death from toxic effects that occur in animals with high degrees of bacteremia. The local and fatal effects of the infection are due to the toxins produced by B. anthracis. Pathogenesis of anthrax Spore is the infective stage of the bacilli. The median lethal inhalational dose for humans\u2014extrapolated from data on experimental infection in monkeys\u2014has been estimated to be 2500-55,000 spores. Spores initiate the disease process in the following ways: The spores, after ingestion by macrophages at the site of entry, germinate to form the vegetative forms of the bacteria. Virulent anthrax bacilli multiply at the site of infection with production of capsule and toxins. Phagocytes migrate to the area but the encapsulated anthrax bacilli resist phago-cytic engulfment; or if engulfed, resist killing and digestion. The anthrax toxin causes further impairment of phagocytic activity and its lethal effect on leukocytes, including phago-cytes, at the site. The activated 83-kDa PA of B. anthracis binds to specific receptors on the host cell surface, thereby creating a secondary binding site for which LF and EF compete and bind, leading to formation of lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. The lethal toxin or edema toxin is internalized by endocytosis. Subsequently, following the acidification of the endosome, the lethal toxin or edema toxin crosses the membrane into the cytosol via PA-mediated ion-con- ductive channels. Edema toxin produces the characteris-tic edema of anthrax. Subsequently, the bacteria and their toxins enter the circulation, causing systemic morbidity. The bacteria multiply locally and may invade the blood- stream or other organs (e.g., liver, spleen, and kidneys) via the efferent lymphatics. The presence of anthrax bacilli in the capillaries at the infection site is the characteristic finding in anthrax. The bacilli are found in the capillaries of the invaded organs, such as skin, liver, spleen, or lungs. Dissemination from the organs back into the blood-stream may result in bacteremia. In bacteremic anthrax, hemorrhagic lesions may develop anywhere on the body. The local and fatal effects of the infection are due to the toxins produced by B. anthracis. Host immunity Anthrax is primarily a disease of animals. Herbivores (e.g., cattle, sheep, and horses) are very susceptible to the infection. Rats, chicken, pigs, cats, and dogs are quite resistant to the disease. Birds, buzzards, and vultures are naturally resistant to anthrax but may transmit the spores on their talons and beaks. Humans show intermediate susceptibility to B. anthracis. Animals surviving naturally acquired anthrax are immune to reinfection. Second attacks are extremely rare. Permanent immunity to anthrax appears to be conferred by specific antibodies (a) to the anthrax toxins and (b) to the capsular polypeptide. Antibodies against the anthrax toxin, primarily against PA, are protective. Clinical Syndromes Human anthrax is of the following clinical types: (a) cutaneous anthrax, (b) gastrointestinal anthrax, (c) inhalational anthrax, and (d) anthrax meningitis. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of anthrax and constitutes more than 95% of the naturally occurring anthrax. The condition is caused by the entry of spores through the skin lacerations, abrasions; or through fly bites, usually on the face, neck, or arms. This is commonly found in farmers and in per-sons handling infected carcasses. The cutaneous anthrax may progress through the following stages: Papule: The lesion begins as a painless, pruritic papule at the site of inoculation of spores. The papule, which is the primary lesion, becomes a 1-2-cm vesicle within 2 days. Vesicle: The vesicle is filled with clear or serosanguineous fluid containing numerous large, Gram-positive bacilli and very rare leukocytes. A develop. Subsequently, vesicle ruptures, undergoes necrosis, and enlarges, forming an ulcer covered by a characteristic black eschar (Fig. 28-3, Color Photo 25). Eschar: The skin in the surrounding areas may become edematous and necrotic, but not purulent. The name anthrax, meaning coal, comes from the eschar, which is black colored (Fig. 28-3, Color photo 25). The lesion is called \"malignant pustule\" due to its characteristic appearance; however, these lesions are neither malignant nor pustular. Lesions are painless, but on occasion are slightly pruritic. Occasionally, multiple bullae develop along with marked toxic effects, and the lesions especially on the face or neck FIG. 28-3. Black eschar with a rim of erythema and edema: aneous (Courtesy: Thappa Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology. 2nd ed. India: Elsevier, 2005, p. 60, Fig. 6.8.). Chap-28.indd 225 5/14/2012 PMSection III Chapter 28226 BACTERIOLOGY become edematous. Cutaneous anthrax may resolve spontaneously with the eschar drying up and falling off in 1-2 weeks with very little scarring. Cutaneous anthrax usually remains localized. Without treatment, the condition spreads to blood and disseminates to cause systemic infec-tion in nearly one-fifth of the cases. Prompt antibiotic therapy prevents dissemination of the infection, but does not affect the natural history of the lesion. With treatment, the mortality due to cutaneous anthrax is approximately 1%. Gastrointestinal anthrax The condition is caused on ingestion of undercooked meat of infected carcasses containing spores. Abdominal pain and fever are the first symptoms to appear, i.e., 2-5 days after the ingestion of the food. These symptoms are followed by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The anthrax spores invade the mucosa of the GI tract and reach mesenteric lymph nodes. The spores in lymph nodes germinate to vegetative forms and begin multiplying, caus-ing the occlusion of the lymphatic system. This leads to ascites, hemorrhagic adenitis, and edematous stomach and intestine. Ulcers are the primary intestinal lesions and occur mainly in the terminal ileum or cecum. In some cases, necrosis and ulceration at the site of infection produces GI hemorrhage, leading to bloody diarrhea. Anthrax toxins can also cause renal failure. Without antibiotic therapy, death is rapid. Mortality is very high and is always more than 50%. Oropharyngeal anthrax is a variant of intestinal anthrax and occurs in the oropharynx after ingesting meat products con-taminated by anthrax. Oropharyngeal anthrax is character-ized by throat pain and difficulty in swallowing. The lesion at the site of entry into the oropharynx resembles the cutane-ous ulcer. Inhalational anthrax Inhalational anthrax is also known as \"wool sorters disease\". The condition occurs after inhaling spores into the lungs. The spores are present in the dust or in the filaments of wool from infected animals, particularly in wool factories. Spores are ingested by alveolar macrophages and are carried to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Anthrax in the lungs does not cause pneumonia, but it does cause hemorrhagic mediastinitis and pulmonary edema. Inhalational anthrax is characteristically a biphasic illness. The first phase appears abruptly after an incubation period of 1-6 days. It appears as a nonspecific illness. Low-grade fever and nonproductive cough are the nonspecific pulmo-nary symptoms at this stage of the infection. After an additional 24-48 hours, the second phase of inhalational anthrax becomes apparent. The phase manifests as high fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, diaphoresis, and hematemesis. It progresses rapidly to characteristic hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with shock and associated hypothermia. Death occurs within 24-36 hours. The disease has a high fatality rate. Anthrax meningitis Anthrax meningitis may occur commonly as a result of bac-teremia from the inhalational anthrax but is a less common manifestation of the anthrax. The meninges are characteristi-cally hemorrhagic and edematous. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis. Numerous large, encapsulated, Gram-positive bacilli are demonstrated in the CSF. Mortality is as high as 100%, but occasionally, patients treated with antibiotics have survived. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Anthrax is nearly worldwide in distribution, occurring in the soil in the form of extremely resistant spores. These spores cause infection in humans and in farm and wild animals that have grazed on contaminated land or ingested contaminated food. The extent of disease is approximately 20,000-100,000 cases annually, throughout the world. The condition is frequently documented in the Middle East, in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and in the Indian subconti-nent despite vaccination programs. Epidemics of human anthrax have been reported from Russia and Zimbabwe. Sporadic outbreaks have occurred as a result of both agri-cultural and military disruptions. Failure of vaccination programs in livestocks led to a human epidemic, causing 6500 anthrax cases and 100 fatalities during the 1978 Rhodesian civil war. In the former Soviet Union, a mishap at a military microbiology facility resulted in at least 66 deaths in 1979. Anthrax is enzootic in India. An epizootic outbreak of anthrax infections in sheep has been documented in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. Many human cases of cutaneous and GI infections have been documented in these states and from other parts of the country as well. Habitat B. anthracis spores are ubiquitous. They are found in the soil, water, and air. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Infected animals are reservoirs of infection. Anthrax in humans is primarily zoonotic (Fig. 28-4). Infected animals or contami-nated animal products (such as hides, wool, hair, and ivory tusks, Chap-28.indd 226 5/14/2012 1:29:41 PMSection III Chapter 28BACILLUS 227 and poorly cooked infected meat) are the important sources of infection for humans. Humans acquire anthrax infection by: 1. Close contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, such as hides, w ool, hair, and ivory tusks (cutaneous anthrax ). 2. Ingestion of poorly cooked infected meat contaminated with anthrax spores (GI anthrax). 3. Inhalation of aerosolized anthrax spores associated with the large-scale processing of hides and wool in enclosed factor y spaces (inhalational anthrax ). Inhalation of spores disseminated by terrorists an impor-tant mode of transmission in biological warfare. The pos-sible use of anthrax spores in bioterrorism is a major concern nowadays (Box 28-1). Weapon-grade anthrax spores in bioterrorism may be dispersed as an aerosol for mass effect or by restricted spore dissemination and contamination via letters or packages. Since October 2001, 22 confirmed or sus-pected cases of anthrax infection have been identified in the United States.Direct spread of the disease from humans to humans is rare. Infected animals discharge large number of bacilli from their mouth, nose, and rectum. These bacilli sporulate in the soil and remain viable over a long period of time. The contaminated soil is the important reservoir of infection for animals. Infection occurs in susceptible animals by the ingestion of the spores present in the soil. Laboratory Diagnosis It is essential to follow biosafety (level II) precautions while handling clinical specimens suspected for anthrax in a micro-biology laboratory. Specimens These include: Vesicular fluid, fluid from under the eschar (in cutaneous anthrax); Blood, lymph node, or splenic inhalational anthrax); CSF (in Sputum and blood (in inhalational anthrax). Microscopy The smears are stained with Gram (McFadyean's skin (vesicular fluid CSF, or blood show encapsulated, broad, large, Gram-positive bacilli. The bacteria are found as single, in pairs, and in short chains. The bacilli do not show any spores. By Gram staining, a presumptive identification of anthrax can be done (Fig. 28-5, Color Photo 26).Spore contaminated hide of herbivores (cattle, sheep, goats)Ingestion of contaminated food products Inhalation of contaminated dust (wool sorters' disease) Contact with contaminated animal products (wool, hair, hides) Heat resistant spores in soil FIG. 28-4. Transmission of anthrax. 1. The possibility of creating aerosols containing anthrax spores has made Bacillus anthracis a chosen weapon of bioterrorism. 2. Spores of B. anthr acis can be produced and stored in a dry form and remain viable for decades. 3. Many nations have the capability to load spores of B. anthr acis into weapons. 4. Domestic terrorists may develop means to distribute spores via mass att acks or small-scale att acks at a local level. 5. Weapon-grade anthrax spores in bioterrorism may be dispersed as an aerosol f or mass ef fect or by restricted spore dissemination and contamination via letters or packages.Box 28-1 Anthrax and biological warfare blue-stained smears of blood show an amorphous purplish material, remnant of the capsular material around the bacillus. This reaction is called McFady-ean's reaction (Fig. 28-6) and is used for presumptive diag-nosis of anthrax in animals. Key Points In smears from infected tissues, the bacteria are found as sin-gle, in pairs, and in short chains, the entire chain being sur-rounded by a capsule. Blood smears containing anthrax bacilli stained with polychrome methylene blue show an amor-phous purple material around the bacilli. This amorphous purple material represents the disintegrated capsule and is a characteristic of anthrax bacillus. This reaction is known as McFadyean's reaction and is used for presumptive diagnosis of anthrax (Fig. 28-6, Color Photo 24). Culture Clinical specimens are inoculated on blood or nutrient agar or on specialized selective media for isolation of B. anthracis. Knisely's PLET medium is used for selective isolation of B. anthracis from soil and clinical materials containing numerous other spore-forming bacteria. Identification of bacteria Absence of hemolysis on blood agar and the formation of medusa head colonies are the characteristic features of B. anthracis that are used to differentiate from other closely related Bacillus species. The identifying features of B. anthracis are summarized in Box 28-2. Animal inoculation B. anthracis can be isolated by collecting specimens from the contaminated tissue and applying them over the shaven skin sites of guinea pigs. The bacteria present in the specimen pen-etrate the skin through minute abrasions. Later, the bacilli are demonstrated in the sputum and heart blood of the guinea pigs, which die 2-3 days after the inoculation. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis of anthrax is based on the demonstration of antibodies against protective antigen (PA) in the patient's serum. Gel diffusion, complement fixation, indirect hemagglu-tination, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the tests used for demonstration of serum antibodies. ELISA test has been used recently to demonstrate serum IgG against PA. The test is considered positive if a single acute-phase serum shows a high titer of antibodies or if a four-fold greater rise in the antibody titer is observed between acute and convalescent serum specimens. The test is 98.6% sensitive and 80% specific. Specific IgG anti-PA antibodies are detected as early as 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but a high IgG levels is observed only 40 days after the onset of symptom. Ascoli's thermoprecipitation test is used mainly for rapid diagnosis when the tissue received is putrid and viable bacilli are unlikely to be found. The tissues are ground up in saline and boiled for 5 minutes and filtered. When this extract is layered over the anti-anthrax serum in a narrow tube, a ring of precipitate appears at the junction of two liquids within 5 minutes in a positive case.

Penicillin, such as amoxi-cillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, is effective for the treatment of cutaneous anthrax. But after October 2001, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is usually recommended due to the possibility of genetically engineered penicillin-resistant anthrax strains. Patients with inhalational anthrax are treated with multidrug regimen of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline along with at least one more antibiotic, such as imipenem, for 60 days is effective against cases of GI anthrax. Doxycycline is not suitable for use in suspected cases of anthrax meningitis, because it has poor penetration of the central nervous system. B. anthracis shows resistance to sulfonamides and extended-spec-trum cephalosporin. Antimicrobial therapy makes lesions culture-negative within hours, but the clinical manifestations of anthrax are related to the effects of the anthrax toxins. Antibiotics are ineffective once the toxin is formed; however, they may reduce the case fatality rate. Prevention and Control These include (a ) chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, (b ) immuno- prophylaxis with (c ) decontamination of animal products. Chemoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for people who have been exposed to anthrax but do not have symptoms of the disease. This is use-ful to reduce the risk or progression of disease due to inhaled anthrax spores. Ciprofloxacin, tetracyclines including doxycy-cline, or penicillin administered for a period of 60 days is effective. Immunoprophylaxis Immunoprophylaxis includes vaccination in animals and in humans.Vaccination in animals: Control of anthrax in animals is essential to prevent transmission of infection to humans. Vaccines comprising killed bacilli and/or capsular antigens produce no significant immunity. A nonencapsulated toxigenic strain has been used effectively for vaccination in livestock. The Sterne vaccine contains spores of a nonencapsulated avirulent mutant strain of B. anthracis. The mutant strain pro-duces sublethal amounts of the toxin that induces formation of protective antibodies. The animal is protected for a year with a single injection of spore vaccine. It is extensively used in ani-mals; however, it is not safe for human use. The vaccination of animals has also been used: to protect people living in an area endemic for the disease and to protect persons dealing with animal and animal products.Vaccines Vaccination in humans: A noncellular human anthrax vac-cine called anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA) is available for individuals in high-risk occupations only in the United States. The vaccine is a preparation of the PA recovered from the culture filtrate of an avirulent, nonencapsulated strain of B. anthracis that produces PA during active growth. Anthrax immunization consists of three subcutaneous injections given 2 weeks apart followed by three additional subcutaneous injections given at 6, 12, and 18 months. Annual booster injections of the vaccine are required to maintain a protective level of immunity. The vaccine is recommended for the use as part of pos-texposure treatment of healthy individuals from 18 to 65 years of age, who are at a risk of exposure to anthrax. Decontamination of animal products These include proper sterilization of animal products, such as wool, hides, etc., and improvement of personal hygiene. Anthracoid Bacilli Bacillus species resembling B. anthracis are collectively called as anthracoid or pseudoanthrax bacilli. These are the opportunis-tic pathogens with low virulence. They are ubiquitous organ-isms, present virtually in all environments. Some of them are frequent laboratory contaminants. B. cereus is the most important pathogen causing GI infection, ocular infections, and catheter-related infections. Bacillus subtilis may act as an opportunistic pathogen, causing eye infections and septicemia. Bacillus licheniformis has also been incriminated in patients with food poisoning. Spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus are used to test the efficiency of sterilization by autoclaves. Some species of Bacillus are used for the production of antibiotics, such as bacitracin, tyrothri-cin, and polymyxin. Bacillus cereus B. cereus is the most important pathogen known to cause food poisoning. B. cereus is a normal inhabitant of the soil, but it can be regularly isolated from foods, such as grains and spices. Episodes of B. cereus food poisoning occur sporadically world-wide. This occurs due to the ingestion of contaminated food in which bacteria have multiplied to high levels under conditions of improper storage after cooking. B. cereus is widely distributed in nature, such as soil, vegeta- bles, milk, cereals, spices, meat, and poultry. B. cereus is a spore-forming Gram-positive bacillus. It is generally motile, but nonmotile strains may also occur. It is a facultative anaerobe. It is a nonfastidious bacterium that grows on ordinary media, such as Mannitol, (MYPA) is the selective media used for the isolation of B. cereus from feces and other sources. B. cereus ferments glucose, but not mannitol, and produces the enzyme lecithinase. B. cereus spores can survive in the soil over a long period. It resembles B. anthracis but differs from it by certain fea-tures as mentioned in Table 28-3. B. cereus produces many toxins and enzymes, which are responsible for many syndromes: The heat-labile enterotoxin is similar to the enterotoxins produced and Escherichia coli. The toxin stimulates adenyl cyclase-cAMP system causing profuse watery diarrhea. Like other enterotoxin, it causes accumu-lation of fluid in ligated rabbit ileal loop. The toxin causes diarrheal form of B. cereus food poisoning. The heat-stable enterotoxin causes emetic form of B. cereus food poisoning, but the exact mechanism of action of the toxin is not known. B. cereus also produces at least three other toxins (a ) cerolysin, a potent haemolysin; toxin; and (c) C, a potent lecithinase. They have been impli- cated to cause ocular infections such as Bacillus panophthalmitis. Diarrheal form of B. cereus food poisoning, caused by heat-labile enterotoxin, results from the consumption of contaminated vegetables, meat, or sauces. The incubation period is long (8-12 hours) during which the organisms mul-tiply and produce heat-labile toxins. The symptoms consist of acute abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea; vomiting is rare. The disease generally lasts for 24 hours or more. The fecal sam-ples contain small numbers of B. cereus. Diarrheal form of food poisoning is caused by B. cereus serotypes 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12. Emetic form of B. cereus food poisoning, caused by heat- stable enterotoxin, results from the consumption of contaminated rice. During the initial cooking of rice, most bacilli are killed but heat-resistant spores survive. If the food is kept at room temperature, the spores germinate to vegetative forms, which multiply and produce enterotoxins. Heat-resistant enterotoxins are not killed on reheating the rice. On ingestion of the rice, the toxin causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps after a short incubation period of 6 hours. Diarrhea and fever are rare. B. cereus is present in large numbers in the cooked rice as well as in the fecal samples of these patients. The disease usually lasts for a shorter duration of 24 hours or less. Emetic form of food poisoning is caused by B. cereus serotypes 1, 3, or 5. Bacillus panophthalmitis results following any traumatic and penetrating injury of the eye with a soil-contaminated object. It is a serious, rapidly progressive infection of the eye resulting in loss of the vision within 48 hours of the injury. Intravenous catheter septicemia and endocarditis are the other infections caused by B. cereus in immunocompromised patients. Suspected food, feces, and vomitus are cultured on ordinary media or a special MYPA medium. Spore-bearing Gram-positive bacilli may be seen on smear from the colonies. Specimens from infected eye and intravenous catheter sites and other specimens may be cultured for isolation of the bacteria. Food poisoning is mild and self-limiting, requiring no spe- cific treatment. Other Bacillus infections need prompt treatment with antibiotics. B. cereus\u2014causing other infections\u2014shows a high incidence of multiple drug resistance. It is resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. It is sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. Food poisoning is prevented by adequate cooking, avoid- ance of recontamination of cooked food, and proper storage (efficient refrigeration).

They consumed a mutton preparation, among other dishes. Two days after dinner, 20 of them fell sick with severe abdominal pain and fever, followed by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some patients had blood diarrhea. All were admitted to a local hospital. History revealed that the meat of a sheep, which died in the morning, was cooked for the dinner. Few other sheep were also found to be dead. Veterinary doctors examined the carcasses of the sheep and diagnosed anthrax to be the cause of death of these animals. The patients suspected to be suffering from GI anthrax were treated with a course of ciprofloxacin. All the patients recovered fully. What was the infective stage of the bacteria that caused the disease? What investigations would be useful to diagnose the condition? What are the modes of transmission of anthrax? What are the vaccines available against anthrax in animals and humans? Do these bacteria show any resistance to antibiotics?CASE STUDY Chap-28.indd 230 5/14/2012 1:29:42 PMMycobacterium anaerobic bacilli capable of forming endospores. The endospores typically are wider than the bodies of the bacilli, giving the bacteria a swollen appearance resembling a spindle, hence the name Clostridium (kloster, spindle). Clostridium Many methods have been followed for classification of clostridia. The traditional method for the classification of Clostridium is based on a combination of different characteris-tics, which include: 1. Optimal growth in anaerobic conditions. 2. Demonstration of spores. 3. Biochemical tests. 4. Gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic products of the bacteria. As per this classification, more than 130 species ha ve been described in the genus Clostridium . Most species are found as harmless saprophytes in the soil, water, sewage, and decomposed (animal and plant) products. They are also present as part of the normal flora in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and ani-mals. Only few species cause infections in humans (Table 29-1).Clostridium Bacteria Diseases Clostridium caused by Clostridium speciesClostridia are more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and food poisoning. Tetanus, gas gangrene, and botulism are three major clinical syndromes caused by Clostridium spe- cies. Pathogenicity of clostridia is attributed to the features: 1. They produce a number of neurotoxins, enterotoxins, and histolytic toxins. 2. They sur vive as spores in adverse environmental conditions. 3. They grow well in enriched media in anaerobic conditions. General Properties of Clostridia Clostridia show following morphological properties: Most species are few species such as Clostrid-ium tertium, Clostridium histolyticum, etc. are aerotolerant and hence can grow on agar even in presence of air. Clostridia are rod-shaped 3-8 The are highly pleomorphic and show long filaments and involution forms. They are Gram-positive but old cultures may appear Gram-variable and even Gram-negative. Most Clostridium species with few exceptions (e.g., Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani type VI) are motile Clostridium butyri- cum are noncapsulated. Ability to produce endospores is the most important feature of clostridia. Spores: Formation of spores is variable depending on the spe-cies. Clostridium sporogenes and other clostridia sporulate readily, while and other species produce spores inconsis- tently. Sporulation takes place outside in the environment and also in animal bodies, but not in humans. The shape and loca-tion of the spores (Fig. 29-1) in the bacteria vary in different clostridial species: 1. Central spores: In Clostridium bifermentans , bacil- lus shape. 2. Subterminal spores: In C. perfringens , giving the bacillus a club shape. 3. Oval terminal spores: In C. tertium , giving the bacillus a ten- nis racket shape. 4. Spherical terminal spores: In C. tetani , giving the bacillus a drumstick appearance. Spores are relativ ely more resistant forms than the vegetative forms of the bacilli. They show a variable degree of resistance to heat, drying, and disinfectants. Spores are killed by 1% aque-ous solution of iodine and 2% glutaraldehyde at pH 7.5-8.5. They are particularly resistant to phenolic disinfectants. The spores survive in 2% formaldehyde solution even for up to 5 days. Clostridium botulinum spores survive boiling at 105\u00b0C for 3-4 hours, while spores of C. perfringens and C. tetani are rapidly destroyed by boiling for less than 5 minutes. Some strains of C. tetani can resist boiling for 15-90 minutes. C. perfringens type A strains, however, survive boiling for several hours. FIG. 29-1. Schematic diagram showing different types and arrangement of spor es.spherical and terminal spores (e.g., Clostridium tetani)oval and terminal spores (e.g., Clostridium tertium) oval and central spores (e.g., Clostridium bifermentans)oval and sub-terminal spores (e.g., Clostridium perfringens)Culture: Most species are anaerobic but few species, such as C. tertium, C. histolyticum , etc., are aerotolerant and hence can grow on agar even in presence of air. Presence of adequate quantity of low redox potential (Eh) substances in the media is important for the growth of these anaerobic bacteria. Use of reducing substances, such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, unsat-urated fatty acids, cysteine, thioglycolic acid, alkaline glucose, or metallic iron maintain low redox potentials in the medium. Most clostridia grow at an optimum temperature of 37\u00b0C and pH of 7-7.4. Growth on solid media is variable. Some clostridial species produce hemolysis on blood agar. Robertson's cooked meat (RCM) broth is a useful medium for the growth of clostridia. The medium contains unsatu-rated fatty acids, digested meat, and sulfhydryl compounds. Clostridia grow well in the medium, rendering the broth turbid. Saccharolytic clostridia turn the meat pink, while pro-teolytic species turn the meat black and produce foul smell. Most clostridia produce gas.Sensitivity to antibiotics: The bacteria are sensitive to met- ronidazole, penicillin, and cephalosporins. They are less sensitive to tetracyclines and resistant to quinolones and aminoglycosides. Clostridium perfringens C. perfringens is the most important Clostridium species causing gas gangrene, a severe life-threatening disease. The bacteria also cause necrotic enteritis and food poisoning. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. perfringens shows following morphological features: C. perfringens is large, rectangular, Gram-positive bacillus measuring 4-6 /H9262m in length; it is a straight bacillus with parallel sides and round and truncated ends. The bacilli occur as single, in chains, or in bundles. The bacilli are capsulated. The bacilli are nonmotile, however, the bacteria multiply rapidly, giving a characteristic spreading colony appearance on the media, resembling the growth of motile clostridia. They possess central or subterminal spores. The spores, however, are rarely seen either in clinical specimens from lesions or in culture media. Culture C. perfringens is an anaerobic but aerotolerant bacterium. The bac-teria can grow under microaerophilic conditions and do not die on exposure to air. They grow at a temperature range of 20-44\u00b0C (optimum temperature 37\u00b0C) and a pH range of 5.5-8.0.1. Robertson's cooked meat (RCM) broth: C. perfringens grows rapidly in tissues and in culture media. In RCM medium, C. perfringens produces good growth. The meat is not digested Chap-29.indd 232 5/14/2012 12:00:05 PMSection III Chapter 29CLOSTRIDIUM 233 but is turned pink. It produces an acidic reaction and a sour odor in the culture. Some strains of C. perfringens can grow optimally at 45\u00b0C with a generation time reduced to 10 minutes. This property is made use of in the isolation of C. perfringens in RCM medium (Fig. 29-2), when specimens are contaminated with other clostridial species. Inoculation of the specimens in RCM media followed by incubation at 45\u00b0C for 4-6 minutes and subsequently culturing on blood agar produces pure and predominant colonies of C. perfringens.2. Blood agar: On blood agar containing human, sheep, or rabbit blood, C. perfringens on prolonged incubation produces dual zone of hemolysis (Fig. 29-3, Color Photo 27). This is due to a narrow zone of complete hemolysis by theta-toxin and a much wider zone of incomplete hemolysis by the alpha-toxin of the bacteria. Biochemical reactions C. perfringens shows following reactions: C. perfringens is metabolically active. The bacteria ferment glucose, lactose, sucrose, and maltose with the production of acid and gas. They produce H2S and reduce nitrate to nitrite. They are MR positive, VP negative, and indole negative. They ferment lactose with the production of acid in litmus milk. The color of the medium changes from blue to red. Casein of the milk is coagulated by the production of acid and the coagulated milk is broken down by the production of large volume of gas. Due to the release of gas, the paraffin plug is pushed up with shreds of broken clot adhering to the sides of the glass tube. This reaction is known as stormy fermentation , characteristic of C. perfringens. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: C. perfringens spores are killed within 5 minutes by boiling, but spores of cer-tain strains (food poisoning strain of type A, certain strains of type C) are killed by boiling for a longer period of 1-3 hours. The spores are also killed by autoclaving at 121\u00b0C for 15 minutes. C. perfringens spores are resistant to commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants. The bacilli are sensitive to metronidazole and penicillins.Typing: On the basis of four major toxins (alpha-, beta-, epsilon-, and iota-toxin) produced by C. perfringens, strains of C. perfringens are classified into five types (A, B, C, D, and E). Typing of strains is carried out by in vivo test in animals. This is carried out by neutralization of the toxins with specific antitox-ins via intravenous or percutaneous injections in mice. Pathogenesis and Immunity Virulence factors C. perfringens produces more than 12 toxins and enzymes. All these are the virulence factors, which contribute to pathogen-esis of the diseases (Table 29-2). Toxins Major toxins: epsilon-, and four major toxins produced by C. perfringens.Alpha-toxin: It is the most important toxin produced by all strains of C. perfringens. The largest volumes of alpha-toxin are provided by C. perfringens type A strain. The alpha-toxin is a lecithinase, a phospholipase C, which in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions breaks down lecithin into phosphoryl choline and diglyceride. The toxin is responsible for toxemia typically observed during gas gangrene. It is lethal, dermonecrotic, and hemolytic. The alpha-toxin increases vascular permeability of blood vessels, thereby causing massive hemolysis and bleeding, tissue destruction, and myocardial dysfunction. The toxin lyses erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells. The alpha-toxin causes hemolysis of red cells of most of the animal spe-cies except for goat and horse. The toxin is relatively heat stable and is partially inactivated by boiling for 5 minutes. The lysis of red cells is observed best on incubation at 37\u00b0C followed by reincubation and iota-toxin are the other major toxins in addition to the alpha-toxin; these toxins also play a major role in pathogenesis of the disease. The beta-toxin causes necrotic lesions in necrotizing enteritis. The epsilon-toxin is a protoxin, which is activated by tryp-sin. This toxin increases vascular permeability of the wall of gastrointestinal tract. The iota-toxin is a lethal toxin, which produces necrotic lesions and increases vascular permeability. Minor toxins: These include delta, theta, kappa, lambda, mu, and nu toxins: Delta-toxin is lethal and is hemolytic to the sheep, goat, cattle, etc. red cells. Theta-toxin is an oxygen-labile hemolysin and is a cytolytic toxin. is a deoxyribonuclease. Enterotoxin: Enterotoxin is produced primarily by type A strain of C. perfringens. This is a heat-labile protein. The toxin is produced during the stage of sporulation of vegetative cells to form spores, which is stimulated by alkaline environment of the small intestine. The toxin binds specifically to receptors in the epithelium of the small intestine. This causes disruption in transport of ions in the ileum and jejunum and alters permeability of the membrane. The toxin is antigenic, but the specific antibodies against this toxin found in the serum are not protective.Enzymes and biologically active soluble substances C. perfringens produces many enzymes and many biologically active soluble substances. Neuraminidase is the most important enzyme, which alters cell surface ganglioside receptors and promotes capillary permeability. Other soluble substances produced by C. perfringens The \"bursting factor\" acts specifically on muscle tissue and may be responsible for typical muscle lesions observed in gas gangrene. The \"circulating factor\" increases adrenaline sensitivity of the capillary membrane and also inhibits phagocytosis. Pathogenesis of gas gangrene Mere presence of Clostridium species in wound does not cause gas gangrene. The course of infection after contamination of wound depends on (a) multiplication of the clostridia and (b) subsequent invasion of the tissue. Infection may progress through the following stages:1. Simple wound contamination: The condition is associ- ated with no invasion of the underlying tissues or no produc-tion of toxins. Hence, there is only delayed healing of the lesion.2. Cellulitis: In this condition, clostridia invade the fascial planes and cause anaerobic cellulitis, with gas formation in the soft tissues. The bacteria produce minimal toxin and do not invade the muscle tissues.3. Gas gangrene or clostridial myonecrosis: Gas gangrene is a rapidly spreading edematous myonecrotic life-threatening Virulence factors Biological functions (Alpha) toxin Lethal, dermonecrotic, hemolytic, and is a lecithinase; causes toxemia, increases vascular permeability of blood vessels, leading to tissue destruction. Main cause of toxaemia associated with gas gangrene (Beta) toxin Lethal toxin; causes necrotic lesions (Epsilon) toxin Lethal increases vascular permeability of the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (Iota) toxin Lethal toxin; causes necrotic lesions and increases vascular permeability (Delta) toxin Hemolytic (Theta) toxin Oxygen-labile hemolytic and toxin (Kappa) toxin Collagenase (Lambda) toxin gelatinase ganglioside receptors and promotes capillary permeability Bursting factor Causes typical muscle lesions in gas gangrene Circulating factor Increases adrenaline sensitivity of the capillary membrane Hyaluronidase Breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of infection along tissue planesTABLE 29-2 Virulence factors of III Chapter 29CLOSTRIDIUM 235 condition caused by C. perfringens. The condition occurs in association with extensive muscle trauma contaminated with C. perfringens or other pathogenic clostridia. Gas gangrene is rarely caused by a single Clostridium species, it is usually caused by multiple Clostridium species (Table 29-1). The condition is commonly associated with anaerobic streptococci and faculta-tive anaerobes, such as staphylococci, Escherichia coli, and Proteus species. C. perfringens (predominantly type A) is the most com- mon species causing gas gangrene. Gas gangrene is caused by an inoculation of C. perfringens type A into tissues during trauma or surgery followed by replication of the bacteria and subsequent invasion of the tissues. Factors that contribute to the multiplication of C. perfringens and other anaerobic bacteria at the site of the wound are: Low oxygen tension is the most important condition, which is most frequently seen in war wounds with implanted bul-lets or shell fragments, along with soil particles and bits of clothing. Tearing of arteries and crushing of tissue cause anoxia of the muscles. Extravasation of the blood reduces blood supply to the affected part still further, thereby causing more tissue anoxia. This con-tributes to a fall in the oxygen tension and pH of the damaged tissues. Breakdown of carbohydrates and liberation of amino acids from the proteins inside the damaged and anoxic muscles also provides a suitable condition for the multiplication of anaer-obic bacteria. Clostridia multiply in large numbers and then produce abundant toxins, which cause further tissue damage. Key Points A large number of toxins and enzymes produced by C. perfringens contribute further to tissue damage: The enzyme lecithinase causes increased permeability of capillaries, leading to extravasation and increased tension in the damaged muscle tissue, causing further anoxia. Abundant production of gas by the bacteria further reduces the blood supply and causes anoxia. The alpha-toxin lyses erythrocytes and causes hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria, observed in the condition. The collagenase destroys tissue matrix and hyaluronidase destroys intercellular substances, thereby facilitating fur-ther invasion and spread of the bacteria in tissues. Clinical Syndromes C. perfringens produces a variety of clinical syndromes as follows: (a) soft tissue infections, (b) food poisoning, (c) necrotizing enteritis, and (d) septicemia. Soft tissue infections Soft tissue infections caused by C. perfringens can be (a) cellu-litis, (b) fasciitis and (c) gas invade the fascial planes and cause anaerobic cellulitis with gas formation in the soft tissues. The bacteria produce minimal toxin and do not invade the muscle tissues.Fasciitis and suppurative myositis: The cellulitis progresses to suppurative myositis, which is associated with collection of pus in the muscle planes. In this condition, both muscle necrosis and systemic symptoms are absent.Gas gangrene: Gas gangrene or clostridial myonecrosis is a serious and life-threatening condition. The incuba-tion period is variable. It may be as short as 7 days or as long as 6 weeks after clostridia are introduced into the tis-sue by trauma or surgery. The onset of the disease is rapid and is associated with increasing pain, tenderness, and edema of the affected part and systemic signs of toxemia. Accumulation of gas in the tissues\u2014caused by metabolic activity of the rapidly dividing clostridia\u2014is characteristic of the disease, hence the name gas gangrene. Production and accumulation of gas make the tissues crepitant. There is a thin watery discharge from the wound, and subsequently the discharge becomes serosanguineous. In untreated cases, the condition progresses very fast with extensive muscle necro-sis, shock, renal failure, and even death within 48 hours of onset of the disease. The clostridial toxins typically cause extensive hemolysis and bleeding, and finally death occurs due to circulatory failure. Food poisoning Clostridial food poisoning is caused by some strains of C. perfringens type A. These strains produce spores, which are heat resistant. They typically produce enterotoxin, but produc-tion of alpha- and theta-toxin is very minimal. Food poisoning is caused by ingestion of cold and warmed up meat dishes contaminated with large numbers (10 8-109) of C. perfringens type A strains. Incubation period is short, between 8 and 24 hours. Abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea\u2014but absence of nausea, vomiting, or fever\u2014are characteristic presen-tations of this condition. The disease is self-limiting recov-ery occurs within 24-48 hours. Necrotizing enteritis Necrotizing enteritis caused by C. perfringens type C is an acute necrotizing condition of the jejunum. The condition is char-acterized by abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, shock, and peritonitis. It is severe and often fatal. Immunization with type C toxoid has been reported to protect against this condition. This condition is known as \"Pigbel\" in Papua New Guinea, where it is very common and as \"Darmbrand\" (meaning \"fire bowels\") in Germany. The sporadic cases have also been reported from East Africa, Thailand, and Nepal. Septicemia This is a life-threatening situation with the isolation of bacteria in blood culture. Chap-29.indd 235 5/14/2012 12:00:06 PMSection III Chapter 29236 BACTERIOLOGY Epidemiology Geographical distribution C. perfringens is distributed world wide. C. perfringens type A is responsible for most human diseases including food poisoning, soft tissue infections, gas gangrene, and primary septicemia. C. perfringens type C is responsible for enteritis necroticans. Habitat C. perfringens type A is part of the normal flora of the intestinal tract of humans and animals. These bacteria are excreted in the feces and hence contaminate the skin of the perianal region, buttocks, and thighs. C. perfringens type A spores are ubiquitous. They are found in the soil, dust, and air. They remain viable for a very long period even in adverse environmental conditions. C. perfringens types B, C, D, and F colonize the intestinal tracts of animals and occasionally humans. Their spores usually do not survive in soil. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Gas gangrene occurs following road traffic accidents or any other injuries (like during war) involving crushing trauma of large muscle mass contaminated with pathogenic clostridia. Rarely, the condition may occur following surgical operations. The condition is caused by: Contamination of wound with soil, such as manure soil or cultivated soil, road dusts, or bits of clothing heav-ily contaminated with C. perfringens and other pathogenic clostridia (exogenous infection). Clostridium species that are present on the normal skin, espe-cially on the perineum and thighs, which invade through a wound and cause the infection (endogenous infection). Clostridial food poisoning occurs following ingestion of cold or warmed up meat dishes contaminated with spores of C. perfringens type A. Spores are responsible for the infection. Foods contaminated with large number of bacteria are the sources of exogenous infection in case of necrotizing enteritis. The conditions that facilitate exposure of the food to a large number of C. perfringens spores and malnutrition are the risk factors for the disease. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of gas gangrene and other soft tissue diseases is carried out to: (a) Confirm the diagnosis, (b) Identify the clostridial species, and (c) Differentiate gas gangrene from anaerobic streptococcal my ositis. Treatment has to be started immediately in suspected as well as clinically diagnosed cases without waiting for the laboratory results. Specimens The specimens for gas gangrene include the following: 1. Pus and other exudates from deeper part of the wound and from the sides where infection appears to be most acute; the specimen is collected by a capillar y tube and swab. 2. Smears from the muscles at the edge of the affected site, from the pus and/or exudate from deeper parts of the w ound, and from the necrotic tissue. 3. Necrotic tissue and pieces of muscle fragments. The specimens for in vestigation of food poisoning include feces and remnants of food. Microscopy Gram staining of smears is a useful method in diagnosis of C. perfringens infection. It provides information regarding the species of clostridia that causes the infection and also indi-cates relative number of the clostridial species found in clinical specimens: 1. Demonstration of a large number of Gram-positive bacilli without spores, and absence of leukocytes in st ained smears of clinical specimens, is suggestive of C. perfringens infection. 2. Large-sized Gram-positive bacilli with the presence of oval and 4. bacilli with oval and terminal spores suggest C. tetani or Clostridium tetanomorphum. Culture Specimens are inoculated simulataneously on a set of two fresh and heated blood agar containing 5-6% agar to prevent swarming. One inoculated medium is incubated aerobically and the another inoculated medium is incubated anaerobi-cally for 24 hours or less. C. perfringens grows very rapidly, hence colonies can be demonstrated on the media after a few hours of incubation. A set of four tubes of RCM media are inoculated and heated at 100\u00b0C for 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 hours. Subsequently, subcultures are made on blood agar to detect and differentiate various clostridial species. In cases of septicemia, blood culture is often positive for C. perfringens and C. septicum. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of C. perfringens colonies are presented in Box 29-1.Nagler reaction: Nagler reaction is a useful test for rapid detection of C. perfringens in clinical specimens (Fig. 29-4, Color Photo 28). This reaction demonstrates biological property of the enzyme lecithinase\u2014to produce opalescence in the serum and in the egg yolk media. This reaction is specifically neutral-ized by the use of specific antitoxin. Chap-29.indd 236 5/14/2012 12:00:06 PMSection III Chapter test is performed by culturing C. perfringens on a medium containing 6% agar, 5% peptic digest of sheep blood, and 20% human serum and antibiotic neomycin sulfate. One-half of the medium is inoculated with specific antitoxin raised against C. perfringens, while the other half of the medium does not contain any antitoxin. After 48 hours of incubation, the colonies of C. perfringens on part of the agar without antitoxin do not show any opacity. This is due to the neutralization of enzymatic activity of the enzyme lecithinase. The aerobic spore bearers and coliforms are inhibited by neomycin sulfate in the medium, which makes the medium more selective for C. perfringens. C. novyi, C. bifermentans, some aerobic spore bearers, and some Vibrio species produce the enzyme lecithinase; there- fore, they also produce opalescence in the egg yolk medium. However, reaction is not neutralized by C. perfringens antitoxin, but rather by the antitoxin of C. bifermentans, which produces a serologically related lecithinase. Laboratory diagnosis of food poisoning is made by demonstration of more than 10 6 bacteria per gram of feces, collected within 24 hours of the onset of the condition. Serodiagnosis An enzyme immunoassay to detect enterotoxin in feces has recently been developed for diagnosis of food poisoning. Treatment Surgery is the mainstay of prophylaxis and treatment of gas gangrene. The cases are treated aggressively with prompt removal of damaged tissue and clearing the wounds to remove foreign materials, necrotic tissue, and blood clots. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment has been suggested to be beneficial. Antiserum against alpha-toxin is no longer used. Metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice. Prophylactic use of the antibiotic in association with surgery is effective. The drug is administered intravenously before surgery and is given three times a day at an interval of 8 hours. Antibiotic prophylaxis using broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as gentamicin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, is effec-tive, since occurrence of mixed infections with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is frequent. Antibiotic therapy is not recommended for the treatment of C. perfringens food poisoning. Prevention and Control Use of antibiotics and wound hygiene are the key factors that help in prevention of C. perfringens infections. Wounds are cleansed and debrided, and penicillin may be given for prophy-laxis. No vaccine is available against these diseases. Clostridium tetani C. tetani , an obligate anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus, causes tetanus. Tetanus is an infectious disorder characterized by an increased muscle tone and spasms caused by the release of a neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, produced by C. tetani when it gets inoculated into humans. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. tetani shows following features: C. tetani is a slender, Gram-positive bacillus measuring 4-8 /H9262m in length. Young cultures are usually Gram-positive but old cultures are Gram- variable and even Gram-negative. It is a straight bacillus with parallel sides and rounded ends. The bacillus occurs in singles and occasionally in chains. The bacteria consist of round, terminal, and bulging spores giving drumstick appearance to the bacillus. The spores are rarely seen even in clinical specimens from lesions or in culture media. All strains of C. tetani except type VI are motile by the presence of flagella. Type VI strain bacilli do not contain any flagella, hence are non-motile. The bacterium is capsulated. FIG. 29-4. Nagler reaction. 1. Grows rapidly and produces spreading colonies on solid media. 2.

Ferments lactose with production of acid in litmus milk (stormy ferment ation positive). 6. Nagler reaction positive.Box tetani an obligate anaerobe. The bacteria are extremely sen- sitive to oxygen, hence can grow only in the absence of oxygen. The bacillus grows at an optimum temperature of 37\u00b0C and at pH of 7.4. C. tetani can grow on ordinary media and on media enriched with serum and blood.1. RCM medium: C. tetani grows well on RCM medium (Fig. 29-2). The bacteria produce turbidity with production of some gas in the medium. The meat, although is not digested, turns black on prolonged incubation.2. Blood agar: On blood agar, C. tetani produces alpha- hemolysis surrounding the colonies. On prolonged incubation, the alpha-hemolysis becomes beta-hemolytic due to production of tetano-lysin, a hemolysin produced by the bacteria. Surface colonies tend to swarm over the entire surface of the agar. C. tetani produces an extremely fine translucent film of growth, which is difficult to visualize except at the edges of the colonies (Color Photo 29).3. Gelatin stab culture : C. tetani liquefies gelatin anaerobi- cally. Hence, the bacillus produces a fir-tree type of growth in gelatin stab culture under anaerobic incubation.4. Nutrient agar slope: Inoculation of the bacteria into water of condensation at bottom of the slope of a nutrient agar, fol-lowed by anaerobic incubation for 24 hours yields a pure colony of C. tetani at top of the slope in the tube. This method is known as Fildes technique and is employed as a routine method for isolating pure colonies of C. tetani . Biochemical reactions C. tetani shows following reactions: C. tetani has mild proteolytic activity but completely lacks saccharolytic activity. It does not ferment any sugars. It does not produce H2S and does not reduce nitrates. It is indole positive, but MR and VP negative. It produces a greenish fluorescence on MacConkey medium, which contains neutral red. Other properties Susceptibility to the physical and chemical agents: C. tetani spores of different strains show a variable heat resistance. Most spores are killed by boiling at 100\u00b0C for 10-15 minutes and by autoclaving at 121\u00b0C for 20 minutes. They are also killed by 1% aqueous solution of iodine and 10% of hydrogen peroxide. The spores are resistant to most antiseptics. They are not killed by 5% phenol or 0.1% mercuric chloride solution. They can survive in soil for years.Typing: C. tetani are classified into 10 serological types (types I to X) based on agglutination. All strains produce the same toxin. The toxin is neutralized by the standard antitoxin. Pathogenesis and Immunity C. tetani is a noninvasive bacillus. It causes disease only by pro- duction of toxins, which are most important virulence factors (Table 29-3). Virulence factors C. tetani produces the following toxins: (a) tetanolysin, (b) tetanospasmin, and (c) neurotoxin or nonspasmogenic toxin. Tetanolysin and tetanospasmin are two major toxins, which are pharmacologically and antigenically distinct. Nonspasmogenic toxin or neurotoxin is identified recently.Tetanospasmin: Tetanospasmin is the toxin responsible for the clinical manifestations of tetanus. The toxin is produced during the stationary phase of growth but is released only after the lysis of bacteria. Tetanospasmin is a protein and is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight (MW) 151,000 Da. On release from the bacillus, the peptide is split by an endog-enous protease into two chains: a light chain (A) of 52,000 MW protein and a heavy chain (B) of 93,000 MW protein; the two chains are joined by noncovalent forces of a disulfide bond. The purified toxin is extremely potent. The minimum lethal dose (MLD) of toxin for animals is 50-75 /H11003 10 -6 mg and for humans is 130 ng. Different species of animals show a wide variety in their sus-ceptibility to tetanospasmin. Birds and reptiles are highly resistant to the toxin. Horses are most susceptible to the toxin followed by guinea pigs, goats, and rabbits in the descending order. The toxin acts by preventing the release of neurotransmit-ters, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, etc., thereby specifically blocking synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. This leads to unregulated spread of impulses, inhibited anywhere in the central nervous system (CNS). The binding of toxin is irreversible. Tetanus toxoid is antigenic but nontoxic. Tetanus toxin is made into toxoid by treating it with formaldehyde. Virulence factors Biological functions Tetanospasmin Potent heat labile toxin; prevents the release of neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA, glycine, etc.), hence blocks specific synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. Motor neurons are left under no inhibitory control and undergo sustained excitatory discharge Tetanolysin Heat-stable related to other clostridial hemolysins and streptolysin O. The toxin is of doubtful pathogenicity and appears not to play any role in the pathogenesis of tetanus.Neurotoxin: This is a third toxin recently identified. It is a nonspasmogenic and peripherally active neurotoxin. The role of this toxin in pathogenesis of tetanus is not understood. Pathogenesis of tetanus Tetanus is caused by entry of the C. tetani spores. Under anaer- obic conditions, the spores germinate to vegetative form and subsequently produce toxins, such as tetanospasmin and tetanolysin, under favorable conditions of anaerobiosis. The conditions that favor anaerobiosis in tissues include wounds with low oxidation-reduction potential, such as those with (a) dead devitalized tissue, (b) a foreign body, or (c) active infec-tion. Tetanospasmin is absorbed locally and at the nervous system peripherally at the myoneural junction and is trans-ferred centripetally into neurons of the CNS. The heavy chain (100 kDa) of the toxin is responsible for specific binding to neural cells and for protein transport. The light chain blocks the release of two major inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glycine. This leads to failure of inhibition of motor reflex responses to sensory stimulation. This results in generalized contraction of the agonist and antagonist musculature\u2014the characteristics of a tetanic spasm in the absence of reciprocal inhibition. The shortest peripheral nerves transmit toxin quickly to the CNS, which leads to early symptoms of facial distortion and back and neck stiffness. The toxicity of tetanospasmin depends upon the route of administration of the toxin. The route of administration also modifies the course of clinical manifestation of the disease. Intraneural injection and injection directly into the CNS is most lethal. Intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injections are effective but toxin given orally is ineffective because toxin is destroyed by enzymes present in the gastrointestinal tract. Tetanus in experimental animals: The experimental teta-nus in animals, such as mice, is also dependent on the route of administration of toxins.Intramuscular injection of toxin: This causes ascending tetanus. Intramuscular injection in one of the hind limbs is associated with appearance of tonic spasm of the muscles in the injected limb first. This is due to toxin acting on the seg-ment of spinal cord. The toxins act by preventing the inhibition or removing the nerve impulse, once they cross the synaptic junctions. The nerve continues to send impulses resulting in spasmodic contractions or tetani of the affected muscles. Muscle stiffness is the early symptom, with jaw muscles often developing symptoms first. This condition is called lock jaw; with progression of disease, spasm develops in other mus- cles. The spasm, although brief, occurs frequently and causes immense pain and exhaustion. This condition is called local tetanus. Subsequent spread of the toxin up the spinal cord causes ascending tetanus. In this condition, the opposite hind limb, trunk, and fore limbs are involved.Intravenous injection of toxin : This causes descending tetanus. In this condition, spasticity develops first in the muscles of the head and neck and then spreads downward, which resembles naturally occurring tetanus in humans. Host immunity Specific antibodies produced against tetanus toxin are pro-tective. Antibodies specifically combine with free toxin and prevent the action of the toxin. Prevalence of protective immunity to tetanus is greater in children and in persons aged between 6 and 39 years. Protective immunity from tetanus decreases in older people. Serological study for immunity has shown a low level among elderly individuals in many countries. Approximately 50% of persons older than 50 years are nonimmune, because they never were vaccinated or did not receive appropriate booster doses. Clinical tetanus does not produce a state of immunity; hence, patients who survive the disease require active immunization with tetanus toxoid to prevent a recurrence of the disease. Clinical Syndromes The incubation period of tetanus is variable ranging from few days to several weeks, but commonly 6-12 days. Duration of incubation period depends on: (a ) distance of primary wound infection from the CNS, (b ) the inoculating dosage of bacteria, (c ) toxigenicity of bacteria, and finally (d ) immune status of the host. C. tetani causes tetanus, which can be of the following types: (a) generalized tetanus, (b) neonatal tetanus, (c) localized teta-nus, and (d) cephalic tetanus. Generalized tetanus Generalized tetanus is the most common form of tetanus. It occurs when the toxin produced at the wound site spreads through the lymphatics and blood to multiple nerve terminals. This is because the blood-brain barrier prevents direct entry of toxin to the CNS. The extent of the trauma varies from minor injury to contaminated crush injury. The incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days and depends on the distance of the site of wound from the CNS. Trismus or lock jaw is due to involve-ment of masseter muscle and is the most common and early sign of the disease. Difficulty in swallowing, irritability, and restlessness are the other early signs. As the condition progresses, patients have generalized muscle rigidity with intermittent reflex spasms in response to stimuli, such as noise or touch. Tonic contractions cause opisthotonus, a condition characterized by flexion and adduction of the arms, clenching of the fists, and extension of the lower extremities. During these episodes, patients have intact sensorium and feel severe pain. The spasms can cause fractures, tendon ruptures, and acute respiratory failure. Risus sardonicus 5/14/2012 12:00:07 PMSection III Chapter 29240 BACTERIOLOGY sardonic smile is a typical feature, which occurs due to contin-ued contraction of facial muscles. The condition may progress for 2 weeks even with administration of antitoxin because of the time needed for intra-axonal antitoxin transport. Prognosis of tetanus is dependent on (a ) incubation period, (b) time from spore inoculation to first symptom, and (c ) time from first symptom to first tetanic spasm. Tetanus with short incubation period is graver than tetanus with long incubation period. Recovery is slow and usually takes as long as 2-4 months. Neonatal tetanus Neonatal tetanus is a generalized tetanus, resulting from infection of a neonate. It occurs primarily in underdeveloped countries and is a major cause of infant mortality. The infec-tion occurs due to the use of contaminated blade, knife, or other materials to cut or dress the umbilical cord in newborns, particularly of unimmunized mothers. Usually at the end of the first week of life, infected infants become irritable, feed poorly, and develop rigidity with severe spasms. The condition has a very poor prognosis for survival. The mortality rate exceeds 70%. Localized tetanus Localized tetanus is an unusual form of tetanus. The disease is confined to the extremity with a contaminated wound and occurs when only the nerves supplying the affected muscle are involved. The condition is characterized by rigidity of mus-cles, caused by a dysfunction in the interneurons that inhibit the alpha-motor neurons of the affected muscles. No CNS involvement occurs in localized tetanus, and it has very low mortality rates. Cephalic tetanus Cephalic tetanus is a variation of localized tetanus. The con-dition usually occurs following head injury or occurs with infection of the middle ear. Incubation period is very short (1-2 days). Symptoms may be localized or may become generalized and include isolated or combined dysfunction of the cranial motor nerves, most frequently the seventh cranial nerve. This particu-lar condition has a poor prognosis. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Tetanus is a disease found worldwide. The condition is pre-dominantly a disease of underdeveloped countries. The disease is common in areas where soil is cultivated, in rural areas, in warm and damp climates, and during summer months. Tetanus affects all age groups, with the highest prevalence among newborns and young people. Overall, the annual incidence of tetanus is 0.5-1 million cases, mostly in underdeveloped countries. Neonatal tetanus accounts for 50% of the tetanus-related deaths in developing countries. Habitat C. tetani organisms are found in soil, in animal feces, and, occasionally, in human feces as well as on inanimate objects. The spores may survive for years in some environ-ments and are resistant to disinfectants and even to boiling for 20 minutes. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection C. tetani spores are the infective form of the bacteria. Soil, animal feces, and, occasionally, human feces as well as inani-mate objects contaminated with spores are the primary source of infection. Risk factors for neonatal tetanus include unvaccinated mothers, home delivery, and unhygienic cutting of the umbili-cal cord. Animal dung, clarified butter, etc., applied to the umbilical stump are the other risk factors for neonates. The following types of wounds are more susceptible to tetanus: (a) grossly contaminated wounds; (b) wounds exposed to saliva or feces; (c) stellate, ischemic, or infected wounds; (d) deep (/H110221 cm) wounds; as well as (e) avulsions, punctures, or crush injuries. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of tetanus like that of C. perfringens infec-tion is made on the basis of clinical presentation. Laboratory diagnosis is carried out in the patients only to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Specimens The specimens include excised bits of tissue from the necrotic depths of wounds. Swabs from the wounds are not good specimens. Microscopy Gram staining of smears for C. tetani is useful but frequently unsuccessful and also unreliable. Key Points Demonstration of typical drumstick bacilli in wound tissue (Fig. 29-5, Color Photo 30) is not diagnostic of tetanus. This is because: C. tetani may be present in some wounds without causing tetanus. Furthermore, it may not be possible to distinguish by microscopy C. tetani from morphologically similar Clostridium species, such as C. tetanomorphum and Clostridium sphenoides. Culture The specimens are inoculated on a blood agar and incubated anaerobically for 24-48 hours. C. tetani produces swarming growth, which spreads throughout the plate. The specimens Chap-29.indd 240 5/14/2012 12:00:07 PMSection III Chapter 29CLOSTRIDIUM 241 are also inoculated to a set of three tubes of RCM media, one of which is heated at 80\u00b0C for 15 minutes, the second for 5 min-utes, and third is left unheated and are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 hours. Subsequently, subculture is made daily on blood agar for up to 4 days. From the swarming edges of the colo-nies on blood agar, C. tetani is isolated in pure culture. Culture is positive in only 30% of cases of tetanus because tetanus is caused only by a few organisms, and many organisms are killed when exposed to air during processing of specimens. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of C. tetani are distinguished by their morphology, cultural, and toxigenic characteristics (Box 29-2). Toxigenicity testing Strains of C. tetani are tested for production of toxin by follow-ing tests:In vitro neutralization test on blood agar: The test is performed on a blood agar containing 4% agar. High percentage of agar is used to inhibit swarming by C. tetani. One-half of the medium is inoculated with tetanus antitoxin (1500 units per mL), while the other half of the medium does not contain any antitoxin. Strains of C. tetani are stab-inoculated on each half of the plate and incubated anaerobically for 48 hours. The colonies of C. tetani show hemolysis on part of the blood agar without any antitoxin, but do not show any hemolysis on part of the agar with antitoxins. This is due to inhibition of hemolytic activity of the toxin by antitoxin present in the agar. The test is useful to demonstrate identification of the colony as C. tetani , but is not a reliable test. In vivo neutralization test in mice: In this test, a 0.2 mL of a 2-4 days old cooked meat culture of C. tetani is inoculated into the root of the tail of two mice each, one of which is protected with 1000 units of tetanus antitioxin 1 hour before the test (control animal). The other mouse is not protected with any antitoxin (test animal). Symptoms of ascending tetanus due to tetanospasmin produced by C. tetani develop in test animals 12-24 hours after inoculation of the bacteria. The symptoms begin in mouse with stiffness in the tail, which proceed rapidly to the leg on inoculated side, the opposite leg, trunk, and forelimbs, in that order. The animal usually dies within 48 hours. No symptoms appear in the inoculated control animal. Toxigenicity testing in mouse is a reliable method of identification of the colony as C. tetani . Serodiagnosis Serological tests are not used because neither antibodies to teta-nus toxin nor the tetanus toxin are detectable in serum of patients. Other tests The spatula test: This is most useful and a simple bedside diagnostic test for tetanus. This test is based on touching the oropharynx with a spatula or tongue blade. This touch typically elicits a gag reflex and the patient tries to expel the spatula (negative test). The patients develop a reflex spasm of the masseters and bite the spatula if tetanus is present (positive test). The test is 100% specific and 94% sensitive. Treatment Treatment of tetanus is (a) initial supportive therapy, (b) wound debridement and care, (c) stopping toxin production, (d) neutralizing unbound toxin, (e) controlling disease manifes-tations, and (f) managing complications. It includes antibiotics therapy and human immunoglobulin therapy. Antibiotics therapy Antibiotics are used to prevent multiplication of C. tetani in the wound, thus halting the production and release of toxins. Metronidazole is the current antimicrobial drug of choice with penicillin as an alternative treatment. Tetracycline is an alterna-tive drug for patients who are allergic to penicillin or metro-nidazole. Clindamycin, erythromycin, and vancomycin are the other antimicrobials used in the treatment of tetanus. Human immunoglobulin therapy Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is given to neutral-izes unbound tetanus toxins, and also to prevent circulating 1.

A single total dose of 3000-6000 IU is given intramuscularly for children and adults immediately at the time of diagnosis. A lower dose of 500 IU for infants with tetanus neonatorum has been effective. In countries where TIG is not available, equine tetanus antitoxin (ATS) is used for the purpose. Tetanus antitoxin is administered intramuscularly as a single dose of 50,000-100,000 IU after appropriate testing for sensitivity and desen-sitization, if necessary. Part of this dose (20,000 IU) is always given intravenously. Prevention and Control Active immunization Tetanus is completely preventable by active immunization. Active immunization by vaccination with tetanus toxoid is the key to preventing tetanus. Vaccination is carried out by toxoids, which are available either as plain toxoid or adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide or phosphate. The toxoid is given alone or in combination with diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (whooping cough) (DTaP or triple) vaccine. Vaccines The tetanus toxoid and the triple vaccine containing tetanus toxoid are very safe and effective. The toxoid stimulates pro-duction of protective antibody response in virtually all immu-nocompetent subjects. Many studies have shown the presence of protective serum antibody levels in up to 90% of immunized people 15 years after vaccination. Slight fever and soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site are very minor and infrequent side effects. Patients cannot contract tetanus from the vaccine. Primary prevention of tetanus is achieved by vaccination with the triple vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12-18 months and 4-6 years. A tetanus-diphtheria (dT) booster dose is adminis-tered at 11-12 years and thereafter every 10 years. For the primary immunization of unimmunized children 7 years or older, tetanus toxoid is administered as two doses 4-6 weeks apart, with a third dose 6-12 months later. Booster doses are administered every 10 years or at the time of major injury if it occurs more than 5 years after a dose. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is recommended for: (a) All adults who have not had a booster dose in the last 10 y ears, (b) Adults who ha ve recovered from tetanus, and (c) Adults who have never received immunization against tet anus. Immunization for prevention of neonatal tetanus: Neonatal tetanus is prevented by increasing immunization in women of childbearing age, especially pregnant women, and by improving maternity care. For previously unimmunized preg-nant women, tetanus toxoid is given twice during pregnancy, 4-6 week apart, preferably in the last two trimesters and again at least 4 weeks before delivery. Maternal antitetanus antibodies are passed to the fetus, and this passive immunity is effective for many months after birth of the child. Passive immunization Human TIG is used for passive immunization. In countries where TIG is not available, ATS is also used for the purpose. Passive immunization is carried out by intramuscular administration of 250-500 IU of TIG or by subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of 1500 units of ATS. Passive immunization is recommended for: (a) nonimmunized individuals and (b) for those whose immunization status is uncertain when-ever a w ound is contaminated or likely to have devitalized tissue. Combined immunization Secondary prevention of tetanus is achieved postexposure through appropriate wound cleansing and debridement, and com bined immunization. Combined immunization is carried out by simultaneous administration of ( a) human TIG or the ATS and (b) tetanus toxoid. It is indicated if the patient has not been previously immunized with a series of at least three doses of toxoid. Clostridium botulinum C. botulinum is a heterogeneous group of spore- forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria causing botulism, a paralytic disease with the presentation of food poisoning. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. botulinum shows following features: C. botulinum is Gram-positive in young cultures less than 18 hours' old. The organism may be Gram-negative in cultures after 18 hours of incubation. The bacillus measures 5 /H11003 1 /H9262m. The bacillus is motile by the presence of peritrichous flagella, and possesses subterminal and oval bulging spores. The bacteria are noncapsulated. Culture C. botulinum is a strict anaerobe. The bacteria grow at an optimum temperature of 35\u00b0C. The bacteria can grow on a wide range of media including blood agar, Mueller-Hinton agar, and RCM media. On blood agar, C. botulinum produces large, irregular, and semitransparent colonies with irregular fimbriate border. They produce spores when grown in alkaline glucose gelatin media at 20-25\u00b0C. Biochemical reactions C. botulinum shows following reactions: Chap-29.indd 242 5/14/2012 12:00:08 PMSection III Chapter 29CLOSTRIDIUM 243 C. botulinum is identified by its ability to ferment glucose, hydro-lyze gelatin, digest protein, and produce the enzyme lipase. Production of enzyme lipase is demonstrated by formation of iridescent film on C. botulinum colonies grown on egg yolk agar. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: C. botulinum organisms as well as spores are highly resistant. They are resistant to boiling at 100\u00b0C for several hours, but are killed by pressure cooking at 120\u00b0C for 10 minutes. C. botulinum types B, E, and F spores are relatively less heat resistant. The toxins are destroyed by boiling for 10 minutes or cooking at 80\u00b0C for 30 minutes.Typing: C. botulinum is a heterogeneous group of spore- forming, anaerobic, Gram-positive microorganisms. They are classified into seven types (A to G) on the basis of the antigenic specificities of their toxins. Pathogenicity and Immunity C. botulinum organisms are noninvasive. They cause disease primarily by production of an exotoxin, the botulinum toxin, which is the major virulence factor of the bacteria (Table 29-4). Virulence factors Botulinum toxin: Botulinum toxin is a protein with molec- ular weight of 70,000 Da. The toxin is relatively heat stable. It is inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 30-40 minutes and at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The toxin is similar in structure and function to the tetanus toxin, except only in the site of action. Botulinum toxin differs from other exotoxins in that it is produced only on death and autolysis of the bacteria, but not when the bacilli are alive. Botulinum toxin is a progenitor protein synthesized intra-cellularly in the bacteria. It consists of two subunits A and B. Subunit A is the light chain and is a neurotoxin. Subunit B is heavy chain, which prevents neurotoxin part (chain A) from being inactivated by acidity of the stomach. More than three B subunits may be present in the toxin. Botulinum toxin is the most potent naturally occurring toxin known to mankind. The lethal dose for mice is 0.000,000,033 mg and for human beings is 1-2 g. Botulinum toxin is lethal at a femto-molar level of doses of 10 /H1100212 g/kg, making botulinum toxin 15,000-100,000 times more potent than serin gas. The toxin can also be toxoided.Depending on the immunological differences in the toxins pro-duced by C. botulinum, eight antigenically distinct botulinum toxins (types A, B, C1, C2, D, E, and F, G) have been described. These different toxins appear to be identical in their biological functions but differ immunologically. The toxins are specifi-cally neutralized only by their homologous antiserum. A single strain of bacteria produces only one toxin. In rare instances, a single strain may produce more than one toxin. All toxins except C2 are neurotoxins. The neurotoxin acts specifically on cholinergic nerves. It acts by preventing the release of a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, at the synapses and at the neuromuscular junctions. It causes atrophy of the muscles at the site of the infection, but the neu-rons regenerate in 2-4 months of recovery. Toxins A and B are the most potent toxins. The production of toxins by C. perfringens types C and D appears to be mediated by bacteriophages. Pathogenesis of botulism Botulism is caused in various ways: Food-borne botulism is caused by direct ingestion of botuli-num toxin in a contaminated food. Infant botulism is caused by toxins produced by C. botulinum present in the intestine. Wound botulism is caused by toxins produced in a C. botuli-num contaminated wound. From the stomach and small intestine, toxins are absorbed, as they are not denatured by digestive enzymes. The toxin enters the vascular system and is transported to peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals, such as neuromuscular junctions, cholinergic parasympathetic nerve endings, and some peripheral ganglia. The toxin binds to receptor sites on presynaptic motor nerve terminals and causes blockade of neuromuscular con-duction. The toxin then enters the nerve terminal and inhibits the release and transmission of acetylcholine in cholinergic nerve fibers. The toxin irreversibly binds to the neurons. The nervous, gastrointestinal, and endocrine-metabolic systems are mainly affected. Because the motor end plate responds to acetylcholine, ingestion of botulinum toxin results in hypotonia, manifesting as descending symmetric flaccid paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Clinical Syndromes C. botulinum causes the following forms of botulisms: (a) food-borne botulism, (b wound botulism Food poisoning occurs on ingestion of preformed toxins in food contaminated with C. botulinum. The severity of illness varies from a mild to a very serious disease resulting in death within 24 hours. The incubation period is short, varies from 12 to 36 hours after ingestion of the contaminated food. Virulence factors Biological functions Botulinum toxin All toxins except C2 are neurotoxins; the neurotoxin acts specifically on cholinergic nerves; it acts by preventing the release of acetyl choline at the synapses and at the Chapter 29244 BACTERIOLOGY Vomiting, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, blurred vision with fixed dilated pupils are the initial signs. Fever, typically is absent. The disease progresses to as bilateral descending weakness of the peripheral muscles, leading to flaccid paralysis. Fever, typically is absent. Death is due to respiratory paralysis and occurs in 1-7 days after onset of the disease. Case fatality varies from 10% to 25%. The use of intensive medical support facilities in the hospitals has reduced the fatality rate, which were as high as 20% seen earlier. Infant botulism Infant botulism unlike food poisoning is caused by neurotox-ins produced in vivo by C. botulinum that have colonized the gastrointestinal tract of the infants. The initial symptoms are nonspecific and include constipation, lethargy, weakness, weak and altered cry, loss of head control, etc. The condition may progress to flaccid paralysis and respiratory arrest. The infants excrete toxins in their feces. The infant mortality due to infant botulism is relatively very low (11-20%). Wound botulism Wound botulism occurs following heavy contamination of wounds with soil or water containing C. botulinum spores. The incubation period is 4-14 days with a mean of 10 days. Wound botulism is similar to food-borne botulism except that the incubation period is longer and no gastrointestinal symptoms are present. Often, the wound appears quite benign. Epidemiology Human botulism is found worldwide. Habitat C. botulinum is ubiquitous. It is found in soil and water world-wide. Spores of C. botulinum type A or B are distributed widely in the soil and have been found throughout the world. Geographical distribution C. botulinum types A, B, E, and rarely F and G toxins cause human disease. Types C and D cause avian and nonhuman mammalian disease. Infant botulism is more common than food-borne botulism. Food-borne botulism is caused by C. botulinum types A, B, and F; very rarely E types. Wound botulism is very rare and is caused by C. botulinum type A strains. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection C. botulinum spores are responsible for causing botulism: 1. Preserved food especially homemade, canned meat and meat products in Europe, canned vege tables in America, and preserved fish in Japan, contaminated with preformed toxin are the main sources of infections for food-borne botulism. 2. Honey and other food contaminated with spores of bacte-ria are the sources of inf ection for infant botulism. 3. Soil and water heavily contaminated with spores are sources of inf ection for wound botulism. Transmission of infection: Botulism is transmitted in following ways: Wound botulism occurs as a result of contamination of wound with spore-forming C. botulinum. The condition occurs in (a ) people with traumatic injury involving contamination with soil, (b ) in people who chronically abuse intravenous drugs (e.g., black tar heroin), and (c ) in women after cesarean delivery (very rare). The condition can also occur even after antibiotics are administered to prevent wound infection. Food-borne botulism results from the ingestion of pre-formed neurotoxins in the food. Consumption of food contaminated with even very small amounts of these toxins has resulted in full-blown disease. During the last 20 years, toxin A has been the most frequent cause of food-borne out-breaks; toxins B and E follow in frequency. High-risk foods include home-canned or home-processed low-acid fruits and vegetables; fish and fish products; and condiments, such as relish and chili peppers. Commercially prepared foods and improperly handled fresh foods may occasionally cause outbreaks of botulism. Infant botulism occurs following ingestion of C. botulinum spores present in infant food such as honey. The spores then germinate to toxin-producing vegetative form that colonize the infant gut. Toxin that is produced in and absorbed from the gut causes the clinical disease. Laboratory Diagnosis The clinical diagnosis of botulism requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. The diagnosis is suspected in an afebrile patient with progressive descending paralysis, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations. Laboratory diag-nosis of the condition rests on demonstration of C. botulinum bacilli or toxins: 1. Diagnosis of food-borne botulism is made by demonstration of C. bo tulinum in food by culture and by demonstration of toxin in food or feces. 2. Diagnosis of infant botulism is confirmed by isolation of bacilli and detection of bo tulinum toxin in feces of the patient. 3. Diagnosis of wound botulism is made by isolation of or by detection of to xin of botulinum in wound pus and exudates. Specimens Feces, vomitus, or gastric aspirate are collected for diagnosis of all the forms of botulism. Tissue from wound is collected for wound botulism. Chap-29.indd 244 5/14/2012 12:00:08 PMSection Gram staining of the smears made from food and other specimens may show Gram-positive spore-bearing C. botulinum. Demonstration of toxin C. botulinum toxin can be demonstrated in foods, feces, and other specimens by serum toxin bioassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and polymerase chain reaction.Serum toxin bioassay: The toxin is demonstrated in food or feces by neutralization test in mice. In this method, food filtrate in sterile saline is inoculated intraperitoneally into two mice. One mouse is protected with polyvalent botulinum antitoxin (control animal) and another is not protected by any antitoxin (test animal). If test animal dies but control animal remains healthy, the test is considered positive and is suggestive of the presence of toxin in the specimen. This is a useful test to dem-onstrate toxin during early stages of food botulism. However, enzyme-linked immunoassays and polymerase chain reaction are still at the experimental stage. Culture In food-borne botulism, C. botulinum may be isolated from suspected contaminated food and from the feces by culture. Food culture is performed first by heating the specimens at 80\u00b0C for 10 minutes. This is done to destroy all the vegeta-tive forms of the bacteria. The heated specimens are then cul-tured on RCM media and incubated in anaerobic conditions subculture on blood agar. Anaerobic incubation facilitates germination of the spores to vegetative forms of the bacteria. Key Points Demonstration of C. botulinum in feces, vomitus, or gastric aspirate by culture is highly suggestive of food-borne botulism, because intestinal carriage is rare. Culture is positive in approximately 60% of cases. Toxin also can be demonstrated in food or feces for diagnosis of food-borne botulism. Demonstrations of C. botulinum in pus culture and detec- tion of botulinum in wound pus and exudates are highly suggestive of wound botulism. Isolation of bacilli and detection of botulinum toxin in feces of the infant confirms the diagnosis of infant botulism. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of C. botulinum colonies are summa-rized in Box 29-3. Treatment Treatment of botulism involves (a) initial supportive therapy, (b) neutralizing unbound toxin by specific antitoxins, and (c) stopping toxin production by use of antibiotics.Antitoxin therapy: A trivalent A-B-E botulinum antitoxin serum specific treatment of botulism. The sera con-tain antibodies against C. botulinum types A, B, and E, which act by binding and neutralizing the toxins present in the serum. The trivalent botulinum antitoxin is administered immediately in patients who are symptomatic with high clinical suspicion of food-borne botulism and wound botulism. Antitoxin is useful, even when given several weeks after toxin ingestion, because circulating toxin has been detected in serum as long as 4 weeks later. Nevertheless, antitoxins do not neutralize toxin already bound to neuromuscular junctions. Although antitoxin can slow disease progression, it has no effect on established neuro-logic pathology.Antibiotics therapy: Antibiotics are used to prevent mul-tiplication of C. botulinum in the gastrointestinal tract and in the wound, thus halting production and release of toxins. Metronidazole is the current antimicrobial drug of choice with penicillin as an alternative treatment. Prevention and Control Food-borne botulism is best prevented by high-temperature pressure cooking, which kills spore present in fruits and vegetables. Storing the food in refrigerator at 4\u00b0C or in an acidic pH prevents germination of spores, if present, to vegetative bacterial form. Strict compliance of recommended home-canning techniques is essential. Wound botulism is prevented by immediate and a thorough debridement of contaminated wounds. Cessation of drug use by drug addicts prevents wound botulism due to intravenous drug abuse. Infant botulism is prevented by avoiding administration of honey to infants. Clostridium difficile C. difficile was first described in 1935 from the feces of healthy newborns and was initially not thought to be a pathogen. It was named difficile because it grows slowly and is difficult to culture. It is a long slender Gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus bearing large, oval, and terminal spores. It is nonhemolytic, saccharolytic, and mild proteolytic. 1. Produces large, irregular, and semitransparent colonies with irregular fimbriate bor der on blood agar. 2. Gram-positive bacilli with subterminal and oval bulging spores in the Gram-st ained smear of the colon y. 3. Motile and capsulated bacteria. 4. Ferments glucose, hydrolyze gelatin, and digest protein. 5. Produces enzyme lipase. 6. Serum toxin bioassay in mouse\u2014a reliable method of detection of toxin of C. botulinum.Box 29-3 Identifying features of Clostridium agent of antibiotic-associated and colitis. C. difficile produces two antigenically distinct toxins: toxin A and toxin B. Toxin A is an entero-toxin and toxin B is a cytotoxin. Both the toxins contribute to pathogenesis of C. difficile colitis and diarrhea in humans. Both are proteins which bind to specific receptors present in the mucosa of the intestine. The toxins gain entry into cells and catalyze a specific alteration of Rho proteins and gluta-myl transpeptidase (GTP)-binding proteins that help in actin polymerization, cytoskeletal architecture, and cell movement. C. difficile colonization occurs by the ingestion of the spores. Hence, outbreaks of C. difficile diarrhea may occur in hospitals where contamination with spores is more common. Normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract resists coloniza- tion and overgrowth with C. difficile. Antibiotic therapy is the key factor that alters the normal bacterial flora of the intestine. The use of antibiotics suppresses the normal flora of the intes-tine and facilitates colonization and multiplication of C. difficile as well as production of toxins that cause inflammation of the mucosa and damage. C. difficile causes malaise, anorexia, and mild-to-moderate diarrhea, occasionally with abdominal cramping. Diarrhea develops in most patients during or shortly after starting anti-biotics. However, in 25-40% of patients, diarrhea may occur 10 weeks after completing antibiotic therapy. It is associated with formation of pseudomembranes and, occasionally, adher-ent yellowish-white plaques on the intestinal mucosa. The condition in rare cases presents with an acute abdomen and fulminant life-threatening colitis. C. difficile spores are heat-resistant, which can persist in the envi- ronment for several months to years. C. difficile is present in 2-3% of healthy adults and in 70% of healthy infants. C. difficile infec-tion is more common in old people; this may be due to increasing susceptibility of mucosal flora to colonization by the bacteria and disease. The infection is uncommon in infants and young chil-dren, although they frequently harbor the bacteria and its toxins.The diagnosis of C. difficile colitis is suspected in any patient with diarrhea who has received antibiotics within the previous 2 months and/or when diarrhea occurs 3 days or more after hospitalization. Diagnosis of C. difficile diarrhea is made by demonstration of C. difficile toxin in the feces by stool cytotoxin test and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: The stool cytotoxin test is the test of choice. In this test, diarrheal stool is filtered and then inoculated to Hep-2 and human diploid cell cultures. The demonstration of a cyto-pathic effect that is neutralized by specific antiserum indi-cates the presence of the toxin (positive test). Absence of cytopathic effect is considered a negative test. The test has a high sensitivity of 94-100% and a specificity of 99%. Dis-advantage of the test are that it is expensive and it requires a tissue culture facility. Several enzyme immunoassays with moderate sensitivity (69-87%) and high specificity (99-100%) are now commer-cially available for rapid detection of the toxin and diagno-sis. The latex agglutination test has been employed to detect the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase, produced by C. difficile, for diagnosis of C. difficile diarrhea. The test shows a low sensitivity (48-59%) but a high specificity (95-96%). Stool cultures, however, are not useful due to the presence of nontoxigenic strains of C. difficile in feces. No treatment is necessary for asymptomatic carriers. Stoppage of the use of causative antibiotics may be the only treatment necessary for those with mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea without fever, abdominal pain, or leukocytosis. This approach allows for reconstitution of the normal colonic microflora and significantly reduces the risk of relapse. Patients with more severe diarrhea or colitis require treat- ment with antibiotics. Metronidazole is the drug of choice. Vancomycin and bacitracin are also effective. More than 95% of patients respond to 10 days of treatment with oral vancomycin, or oral or intravenous metronidazole. An 18-year-old college student came to a hospital with a complaint of facial spasm. He has been unable to eat for 2 days due to severe pain in his jaw. Examination revealed trismus and risus sardonicus. The student gave a history of playing football for his college team, during which he had sustained a minor knee injury with abrasions 6 days earlier. He did not visit any doctor earlier or receive any toxoid for the injury. He did not remember of receiving any booster vaccination with tetanus toxoid in last many years. A clinical diagnosis of tetanus was made. What laboratory tests should be performed to confirm the diagnosis? Should treatment wait until laboratory results are available? Describe the pathogenesis of tetanus. What are the vaccines available against tetanus in humans?CASE STUDY Chap-29.indd 246 5/14/2012 12:00:08 anaerobic cocci are a heterologous group of bacteria that typically colonize the skin and the mucous membranes. The taxonomical classification of these cocci has undergone several modifications and importantly, the classification has been simplified now. The anaerobic cocci are divided into belong to the genus Peptostreptococcus. The cocci are small and measure 0.2-2.5 /H9262m in size. Many of the cocci are aerotolerant and grow well in air supplemented with 10% CO 2. These Gram-positive cocci are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and skin. These bacteria on spreading from these sites to other normally sterile sites may cause several clinical infections: (a) Bacteria colonizing the skin can cause cellulitis and infec-tions of the soft tissue; (b) Bacteria in the intestine can cause intra-abdominal inf ection; (c) Bacteria in the genital tract can cause pelvis abscess, salpingitis, and endome tritis; and (d) Bacteria invading blood stream can cause infections in bones and visceral organs. Pep tostreptococcus anaerobius is most commonly associated with puerperal sepsis and Peptostreptococcus magnus with abscess.The laboratory diagnosis of the infection caused by these cocci depends on the isolation of the bacteria by culture. Clinical specimens are inoculated on blood agar or other enriched agar and incubated for at least 5-7 days in anaerobic conditions, unlike other anaerobic bacteria that typically grow in 1-2 days. While collecting the specimens, care should be taken to prevent contamination of the specimens with Peptostreptococcus that normally colonize the mucosal membrane and skin surface. The cocci are often found in large numbers in pus from suppurative lesions; hence Gram staining of pus smears is frequently helpful in diagnosis. The cocci are generally sensitive to imipenem, chlorampheni- col, and metronidazole. are intermediately sensitive to cephalosporins, tetracyclines, and clindamycin. They are resistant to streptomycin and gentamicin. Most infections are mixed, the cocci being present along with anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli and clostridia. Hence, broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against all these pathogens are usually given for treatment. Anaerobic Veillonella spp. includes anaerobic Gram-negative cocci of varying size occurring in pairs, short chains, or clus-ters. These cocci normally colonize the mouth, intestines, and genitourinary tract. Veillonella parvula is the species frequently reported from clinical specimens, but its role in causation of the disease is not of facultatively anaerobic or strictly anaerobic bacteria that characteristically colonize the skin and mucosal membranes. The group includes many genera, but few of these are associated with clinical infections (Table 30-1). Propionibacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Mobiluncus spp., and human infections. Eubacterium spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. are isolated in clinical specimens; they rarely cause human disease. Propionibacterium Propionibacterium species are anaerobic or aerotolerant bacteria found as part of the normal flora of the skin, oropharynx, con-junctiva, external ear, and female genital tract. They are Gram-positive bacilli that are frequently present in short chains and clumps. They are nonmotile and are catalase positive. They ferment carbohydrates with production of propionic acid, hence named Propionibacterium. Propionibacterium are not fastidious. They can grow on nutri-ent agar or other simple media. However, they grow slowly, take 3-5 days to produce colonies. Propionibacterium acnes and Propionibacterium propionicus are two important species of clinical importance. P. acne is the most common causative agent of acne in teenagers and young adults. The species also causes infections of heart valves or Nonsporing Anaerobes Chap-30.indd 247 cerebrospinal shunts and cellulitis. P. acne is a common contaminant in blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture. Isolation of Propionibacterium from clinical specimens needs to be interpreted in light of the clinical condition. The lesions in acne develop within the sebaceous follicles; hence are not related to effectiveness of the cleanliness of the skin. The condition is treated best with topical application of benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics. The bacteria are sensitive to erythromycin and clindamycin. Lactobacillus Members of the genus Lactobacillus are facultatively anaerobic bacilli. They are commonly found in the mouth, stomach, and intestine and in the adult vagina. They are commonly isolated in blood and urine cultures. The presence of lactobacilli even in high numbers in urine culture usually represents contami-nation of bacteria from the urethra, in which lactobacillus are most commonly present. Lactobacilli usually do not cause infec-tion of the urinary tract, because they fail to grow in the urine. Lactobacilli can invade the blood stream during (a ) endocardi- tis, (b ) opportunistic septicemia in immunocompromised host, and (c ) transient bacteremia following genitourinary procedure. Combined therapy with penicillin and aminoglycoside has proved effective against infections caused by lactobacilli. Lactobacilli are resistant to vancomycin. Mobiluncus Mobiluncus species anaerobes. They are Gram-negative or Gram-variable curved bacilli with tapering ends. Despite their Gram-variable properties, they are classified as Gram-positive bacteria because they have a cell wall of Gram-positive bacilli, and they lack endotoxin. The bacteria are fas-tidious; they grow slowly on enrichment media, such as blood agar containing either rabbit or horse blood. They are found as part of the normal flora of the genitourinary tract. In women with bacterial vaginitis, they are found in very high numbers. The exact role of the bacteria as a causative of bacterial vagino-sis is not known. Typical Gram-staining features of the bacteria are diagnostic. They are sensitive to erythromycin, ampicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin but Bifidobacterium spp. and Eubacterium spp. found in the oropharynx, large intestine, and vagina. They are usually isolated as contaminants. Repeated isolation of these bacteria in absence of other pathogens may suggest their role as possible agents of infection. Anaerobic Gram-Negative Bacilli Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli of clinical importance belong to the family Bacteroidaceae. This is classified into four genera: Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella. All these are Gram negative. Prevotella species are very small and elongated, while Fusobacterium species are long and thin. A surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the cell wall. Properties of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides species have now been reorganized. Earlier, genus Bacteroides consisted of almost 50 species. Now, asaccharolytic pigmented species have been reclassified into the genus Porphyromonas (Greek word, meaning \"purple\") and saccharolytic bile sensitive species in the genus Prevotella. The genus Bacteroides now includes Bacteroides fragilis and closely other vulgatus , and pathogen that colonizes humans. B. fragilis is pleomorphic in size and shape, having a typical Gram-negative cell wall. A surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is major component of the cell wall. The LPS of B. fragilis lacks endotoxin activity unlike the LPS of Fusobacterium. B. fragilis is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule. Bacteroides are nonfastidious and grow rapidly in culture, while other anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli are fastidious and grow slowly (3 days and more) in the culture media. The ability of the bacteria to (a) inactivate immunoglobu- lins, (b) cause tissue destruction, and (c) resist oxygen toxicity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of anaerobic infections. B. fragilis and other anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli produce a wide variety of virulence factors, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of disease (Table 30-2). The presence Bacteria Diseases Propionibacterium spp. Acne and opportunistic infections Mobiluncus opportunistic infections Actinomyces spp. pelvic, central nervous and opportunistic infections infections Bacteroides gynecological infections, ureolyticus Fusobacterium nucleatum Head Fusobacterium necrophorum Head and neck infections Porphyromonas asaccharolytica Head and neck infections Porphyromonas gingivalis Head and neck infections Prevotella intermedia Head and neck infections Prevotella melaninogenica Head and of polysaccharide capsule in B. fragilis helps the bacteria to adhere to peritoneal surfaces more effectively than other anaer-obes. The capsular polysaccharide is antiphagocytic; it acid and other short-chain fatty acids provided by these bacteria during anaerobic metabolism also exhibit phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria. Key Points B. fragilis and other species posses pili by which they adhere to the epithelial cells. Bacteroides produce the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which inactivate the hydrogen peroxide and superoxide-free radicals, thereby protecting these anaerobic bacteria when exposed to oxygen. The other factors that facili-tate spread of these anaerobic bacteria are trauma, tissue necro-sis, impaired circulation, and presence of foreign bodies. B. fragilis and other anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria usually colonize the skin, mouth, nasopharynx and upper respira-tory tract, intestine, and vagina in large numbers. As resident bacterial flora, they prevent colonization by other pathogenic organisms and help in digestion of food. These organisms, however, cause infections when they spread from their usual sites to other parts of the body that are usually sterile. B. fragilis causes more than 80% intra-abdominal infections, even though B. distasonis and B. thetaiotaomicron are found pre-dominantly in the gastrointestinal tract. These two species merely cause any abdominal infections. B. fragilis is the common anaerobic bacteria that cause abscess in the genitourinary tract. It is the most important anaerobic bacteria causing pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, abscess, and other infections of the female genital tract. Other Gram-negative anaerobes: 50% of chronic infections of the sinuses and ears; and most of periodontal infections. Clinical manifestations of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli infections The anaerobic infections are characterized by the presence of poly-microbial mixture of organisms with more than one anaerobic and aerobic bacteria being responsible for the infection. The char-acteristic putrid pus with a nauseating and foul odor, pronounced cellulitis, and not so common fever and toxemia are suggestive of anaerobic infections caused by these Gram-negative bacilli. Laboratory diagnosis of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli infections This depends on the isolation of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in clinical specimens. Isolation of these bacteria need careful inter-pretation since most of the anaerobes are commensals and consti-tute part of the normal flora of the skin and mucous surface. The mere presence of the bacteria does not suggest their causative role. The specimens, as far as possible, are not collected from their normal resident sites. The specimens are also not allowed to dry because drying reduces number of bacteria. Hence, speci-mens are always kept in a moist environment. The specimens are collected and transported to the laboratory in an oxygen-free system to minimize contact with air. In the laboratory, the specimens are inoculated into specific media promptly and incubated in anaerobic condition. Pus and other biological fluids are collected in glass vials or bottles with airtight caps. Collection of fluid and other aspiration in airtight syringes is a better method of collection. After collection, the needle is plunged into sterile rubber container and sealed. Swabs are not the specimen of choice for anaerobic infections but if collected are sent in Stuart's transport medium. Key Points Microscopic examination of clinical specimens by Gram staining is useful for the diagnosis of Gram-negative anaero-bic infections. findings of pus smear showing pleomorphic, Gram-negative bacilli, polymicrobial flora, and numerous pus cells are useful preliminary diagnosis of anaer-obic infections. Direct fluorescent examination may show bright red fluorescence of Prevotella melaninogenica. Many selective media are used, which facilitate isolation of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Freshly prepared blood agar with yeast extract, hemin, vitamin K, and neomycin is useful for culture of anaerobes. The culture plates are incu-bated in anaerobic jar at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 10% CO 2. The gas-pack system, which provides a better method of anaero-biosis, is now used widely. Most Bacteroides grow within 24-48 hours, but some other Gram-negative anaerobes, such as Fusobacterium, grow slowly; hence, culture plates require longer period of incubation. The specimens are cultured in parallel because many aerobic bacteria are also involved in polymicro-bial infections.Virulence factors Biological functions spp.)Antiphagocytic Superoxide and catalase (many species) Resist oxygen toxicity as protease, of specimen is also occasionally useful for identifying metabolic end products of anaerobic bacteria to supplement laboratory diagnosis. Management of Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial infections This depends mainly on surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy. Metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice for treatment of infection caused by Bacteroides and other Gram-negative anaerobes. The anaerobic Gram-negative sensitive to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol. Most of the B. fragilis, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas species are resistant to penicillins and to many cephalospo-rins due to production of beta-lactamase. The resistance is overcome by treating with high concentration of carbeni-cillin, piperacillin, imipenem along with beta-lactamase inhibitors. Bacteroides show plasmid-mediated resistance to clindamycin. A 42-year-old man was admitted to a hospital with abdominal pain and tenderness and fever. On examination, the patient was clinically suspected to be having appendicitis. He was operated. On surgery, a ruptured appendix and a copious volume of foul-smelling pus were found. The pus was sent to microbiology laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. The culture was positive for Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli . Which organisms are responsible for intra-abdominal infections and produce foul smelling pus? How will you diagnose B. fragilis infection? What are the virulence factors of B. fragilis? Which antibiotics will be useful to treat B. fragilis infection?CASE STUDY Chap-30.indd 250 5/14/2012 11:59:33 AMColiforms31 Introduction Enterobacteriaceae organisms are ubiquitous bacteria. They are distributed worldwide and found in the soil, water, and plants. They are also present as part of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals. Members of this family are nonsporing, nonacid fast, and moderately sized Gram-negative bacilli. They by peritrichous flagella or any flagella. They are aerobic and facultatively anaerobic and grow readily on ordinary media, ferment sugars with production of acid and gas or acid only, reduce nitrate to nitrite, and are cata-lase-positive but oxidase-negative. The oxidase test is an impor-tant test by which the members of the Enterobacteriaceae can be distinguished from many other fermentative and nonfer-mentative Gram-negative bacilli. Members of the family show a very wide biochemical and antigenic heterogeneity among themselves. Enterobacteriaceae organisms cause a variety of diseases in humans (Fig. 31-1): 1. Some members of the family, such as Salmonella species, Shigella species, etc., alwa ys cause diseases in humans. 2. Other species, such as Escheric hia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, etc., found as normal intestinal flora in humans can also cause infections in other sites of the human body. 3. In addition to these, there is another group of Enterobacte-riaceae organisms, which are found as normal commensals in humans but become pathogenic when they acquire virulence factor genes through plasmids, bacteriophages, or pathogenicity islands. E. coli associated with gastroen-teritis in humans is one such example. Enterobacteriaceae organisms are acquired from humans (Salmonella Typhi, Shigella species, etc.), animals (Salmonella species and Yersinia species), or through endogenous infection. In the latter, the pathogen (E. coli) can spread from primary site of infection to virtually all the sites of the body. Classification Earlier, the characteristics of the colonies on commonly used medium (such as the MacConkey medium) were used to iden-tify and classify the members of family Enterobacteriaceae. The colonies were classified Proteus spp., etc.) depending on the ability of the bacteria to ferment lactose. This was used as a practical method in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The current practice, however, is to classify bacteria on the basis of a number of morphological, biochemical, sero-logical, and DNA-based characteristics. Bergey's manual, Kauffmann, and Edwards-Ewing's classifications are the three widely used methods for classification of the members of family Enterobacteriaceae. All these methods have nearly the same type of approach for the classification of bacte-ria. As per these methods, the family Enterobacteriaceae is divided into many major groups or tribes. Each tribe con-sists of one or more genera or subgenera. Each genus consists of many species, which are classified into different types, such as biotypes, serotypes, colicin types, bacteriophage types, etc. As per the new classification (Ewing 1986), the family Enterobacteriaceae has been classified into eight tribes as given in Table 31-1. The genus consisting of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of a major disease plague, is included under the tribe Yersinieae in the family Enterobacteriacae (Table 31-1). Important properties distinguishing different genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae are summarized in Table 31-2. Human infections caused by common members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are summarized in Table 31-3.

The genus Escherichia consists of blattae. Of these species, E. coli is the most common and most important species causing infection in humans. E. coli is further subdivided into biotypes and serotypes based on O, H, and K antigens.Escherichia coli E. coli has been recognized as harmless commensal and also as a versatile pathogen. E. coli in humans causes a broad spectrum of diseases. It is an important cause of enteric illness, urinary tract infection (UTI), neonatal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a serious complication of enteric infection with certain E. coli strains.

Some strains of E. coli are late lactose or nonlactose f ermenters. Ability to produce H2S (positive variants) and utilize citrate by E. coli are controlled by transmissible plasmids. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: E. coli is inhibited by the presence of 7% sodium chloride in salt media used for isolation of staphylococci. Growth of the bacteria is also inhibited by sodium selenite in selenite broth, sodium tetrathionate in tetrathionate broth, and brilliant green in brilliant green tetrathionate broth. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) The heat-stable lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major cell wall antigen of E. coli. The LPS consists of three components: (a) the genus-specific somatic O polysaccharide, ( b) a core polysaccha- ride common to all Enterobacteriaceae (common antigen), and (c) lipid A. E. coli organisms possess four major antigens (Fig. 31-3): H or flagellar antigen, O or somatic antigen, K or capsular anti-gen, and F or H antigens are heat- alcohol-labile proteins present on the flagella. The H antigens are genus specific and usually are not shared by other entero-bacteria. All of the H antigens are present as monophasic, but very rarely as diphasic. A total of 75 \"H\" antigens have been recognized so far.O or somatic antigen: O antigens occur on the surface of the outer membranes and are determined by specific sugar sequences on the cell surface. O antigen is an LPS complex and is an integral part of the cell wall. It is heat stable, resistant to boiling up to 2 hours and 30 minutes. Till now, 173 (1, 2, 3, etc. up to 173) O antigens have been described.Properties of the Bacteria Morphology E. coli shows the following features: E. coli is a Gram-negative bacillus, which measures around 1-3 /H11003 0.4-0.7 /H9262m in size. The bacilli are arranged singly or in pairs. They are motile due to the presence of peritrichous flagella. Some strains are nonmotile. Some strains of E. coli may be fimbriated. The fimbriae are of type I (hemagglutinating and mannose-sensitive) and are present in both motile and nonmotile strains. Some strains of E. coli isolated from extraintestinal infections possesses polysaccharide capsule. They do not form any spores. Culture E. coli is an aerobe and a facultative anaerobe. It grows at a tem-perature range of 10-40\u00b0C (optimum 37\u00b0C) and a pH of 7.2. The bacteria grow on a wide range of media including Mueller-Hinton agar, nutrient agar, blood agar, and made on nutrient agar and blood agar.Nutrient agar: E. coli on nutrient agar after 18 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C produces large, circular, low convex, grayish white, moist, smooth, opaque or partially translucent colonies (smooth or S forms). These smooth colonies are easily emulsifi- able in saline. The rough or R forms produce rough colonies with an irregular dull surface. These colonies are often autoaggluti-nable in saline. The smooth to rough variation (S-R variation) is associated with the loss of surface antigens and also with the loss of virulence and occurs as a result of repeated subculturing.MacConkey medium: E. coli produces bright pink flat colonies due to lactose fermentation. Many strains, especially those isolated from pathologic conditions, produce beta-hemolytic colonies on blood agar. They do not grow on selective media, such as DCA (deoxycholate citrate agar) or SS (Salmonella-Shigella) agar, culture of salmonellae and shigellae.Liquid broth culture: E. coli produces turbid growth with a deposit, which disperses completely on shaking. Biochemical reactions E. coli shows following reactions: 1. E. coli ferments lactose, glucose, mannitol, maltose, and man y other sugars with the production of acid and gas. They do not ferment sucrose. Some strains of E. coli are late lactose or nonlactose fermenters. 2. They do not liquefy gelatin, do not produce hydrogen sul-fide (H 2S), or do not utilize urea. Some variant strains of E. coli produce H2S. 3. The indole, methyl red (MR), Voges-Proskauer (VP), and citrate utilization tests, generally referred to as the \"IMViC\" tests, are f our important biochemical tests widely used in the classification of enterobacteria. E. coli is indole and MR positive, and VP and citrate negative (IMViC++--) (Fig. 31-2, Color Photo Salmonella, Yersinia, and Citro- bacter) in the family Enterobacteriaceae. The O antigen also shows cross-reaction with individual E. coli O antigens. The O antigens are detected by agglutina-tion with specific antibodies. K or capsular antigen: The heat-labile K antigen is the acidic polysaccharide antigen present in the \"envelope\" or microcap-sule (K for Kapsel, German for capsule) of the bacteria. K antigen encloses the O antigen and may interfere with detection of the O antigens. This problem is overcome by boiling of the bacterial suspension to remove the K antigens. K antigens may also contribute to virulence by inhibiting phagocytosis. The K antigens are poor activators of com-plement. A total of 103 \"K\" antigens have been recognized. The K antigens are of two types: I and II. E. coli K I antigen shows with Neisseria meningitidis and Haemoph- ilus influenzae capsular antigens. between the two groups are summarized in Table 31-4. F or Fimbrial antigens: These antigens are present on the fimbriae and are heat-labile proteins. A number of filamentous protein structures resembling fimbriae have been described in E. coli. These are K88, K99 antigens in E. coli strains causing diar-rhea in animals or colonization factor antigens (CFA) in entero-toxigenic E. coli (ETEC) causing diarrhea in humans. These fimbrial antigens also contribute to virulence of the bacteria. Antigenic typing The serotyping of E. coli is based on three major groups of antigens: O antigens, K antigens, and H antigens. E. coli strains on the basis of O antigens are initially divided into a number of O groups. Each O group is then further divided into subgroups on the basis of K antigens. Finally, each of the subgroup includes strains with different H antigens. The antigenic pat-tern of a strain is recorded depending on the number of the particular antigen it carries (e.g., E. coli O111:K58:H2). Different serotypes of E. coli are found in the normal intes- tine of humans and they do not have K antigens. The normal colon strains belong to the \"early\" O groups (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). Enteropathogenic strains responsible for intestinal diseases belong to the \"later\" O groups (55, 86, 111, 112, etc.). Pathogenesis and Immunity E. coli is an invasive bacterium. It colonizes the human intestine and, under specific conditions, directly invades the intestinal mucosa or produces toxins to cause intestinal infections. The bacteria can enter the blood stream and cause septicemia, men-ingitis, and other systemic manifestations. The bacteria, under certain conditions, directly invade urinary tract causing UTIs or cause intra-abdominal infections. Virulence factors E. coli produces several virulence factors (Table 31-5), which include the following: 1. Common virulence factors associated with Entero bac-teriaceae. 2. Specialized virulence factors associated specifically with E. coli. Common virulence factors associated with Ent erobacteria- ceae: These include following factors: (a) fimbriae, (b) endo- toxin, (c) capsule, and (d) sequestration of growth factors.Fimbriae: Fimbriae promote virulence of E. coli and other mem- bers of the Enterobacteriaceae. The fimbriae are of two types: The first type is most common and is encoded by chromo-somes, but is not related with virulence of the bacteria; The second type of fimbriae is encoded by plasmids, found only in small numbers, but is closely related with virulence of the bacteria. Some of them do not occur as morphologically distinct struc-tures but only as surface antigens. K88 and K99 antigens in E. coli strains causing diarrhea in animals or CFA in ETEC are examples of such fimbriae. The fimbriae play an important role in pathogenesis of UTI caused by E. coli.Endotoxin: Endotoxin is a major virulence factor shared among all aerobic and some anaerobic Gram-negative bacte-ria including E. coli. Endotoxin is responsible for many of the systemic manifestations of Gram-negative bacteria caused by E. coli infections. Endotoxin also protects the bacillus from phagocytosis and from the bactericidal effects of complement. Properties Group I antigen Group II antigen Susceptibility to heat at 100\u00b0CHeat stable Heat labile Electrophoretic mobilityLow High Molecular weight High (/H11022100,000 Da) Low (/H1102150,000 Da)TABLE 31-4Differences between group I antigens Flagellum(H antigen)Lipopolysaccharide(O capsular K antigens protect E. coli from phagocytosis, which repel the hydrophobic phagocytic cell surface. The capsular antigens interfere with the binding of antibodies to the bacteria. However, the capsule is not effective in the presence of antibody to O or K antigen. Most strains of E. coli responsible for neonatal meningitis and septicemia pos-sess the KI envelope antigen, a virulence factor similar to the group B antigen of meningococci. E. coli and other enteric bac-teria capable of producing systemic infections are frequently resistant to serum killing. Capsule of the bacterium protects the organism from serum killing.Sequestration of growth factors: The capability of the bacteria to compete for nutrients in host cells is an important property of virulent bacteria. E. coli and other enteric bacteria compete for iron, which is an important factor for their growth. The bacteria produce iron-chelating compounds, such as siderophores, entero-bactin, and aerobactin, which facilitates the adsorption of iron by bacteria. Also the bacteria produce hemolysins, which lyse host erythrocytes, thereby releasing iron compounds for use by bacteria.Specialized virulence factors associated specifically with E. coli : These include adhesins and exotoxins.Adhesins: E. coli organisms possess numerous highly pili (binds to P blood group antigens), (f) Ipa (invasion plasmid antigen) protein, and (g) Dr fimbriae (bind to Dr blood group antigens). All these adhesins facilitate firm adhesion of E. coli to the gastrointestinal or urinary tract mucosa, thereby pre-venting the bacteria being eliminated by the flushing action of voided urine or intestinal motility.Exotoxins: E. coli also produces two types of exotoxins: ( ered important in the pathogenesis of disease caused by Virulence factors Biological functions Fimbriae Adherence of bacteria to gastrointestinal tract; of importance in urinary tract infections; and cause mannose-resistant hemagglutination Endotoxin Systemic manifestations of endotoxic shock, and protect the bacillus from phagocytosis and from the bactericidal effects of complement Capsule Antiphagocytosis protects Escherichia coli from phagocytosis. Protect the organism from serum killing Sequestration of growth factors The capability of Escherichia coli to compete for nutrients in host cells Adhesins Adhesins facilitate firm adhesion of Escherichia coli to the gastrointestinal or urinary tract mucosa, thereby preventing the bacteria being eliminated by the flushing action of voided urine or intestinal motility Hemolysins (HlyA) Important in the pathogenesis of disease uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli EnterotoxinsShiga toxins Cytotoxins Heat stable toxin Causes increased secretion of fluids Heat labile toxin Watery diarrhea due to hypersecretion of fluid into the lumen of the gut Siderophores Removes iron from mammalian iron transport proteins like transferring and lactoferrin.TABLE 31-5 Virulence factors of Escherichia coli uropathogenic strains of E. coli. Enterotoxins are important virulent factors of E. coli. Three distinct types of E. coli entero- toxins have been recognized. These toxin (Stx) named because it is similar to the Shigella dysenteriae type 1 toxin in its physical, antigenic, and biological properties. The toxin is also named verocyto-toxin or verotoxin (VT) because the toxin was first detected by its cytotoxic effect on Vero cells. Shiga toxins are of two Both toxins are encoded by lysogenic bacterio-phages. Both have one A subunit and five B subunits. Subunit B binds to a specific glycolipid (globotriaosylceramide, GbJ) present on the host cell. Both the toxins, although show same biological activity, are antigenically different. Stx-2 is not neu-tralized by the antibodies produced against Stx, unlike Stx-1. Shiga toxins demonstrate cytotoxicity activities in vero or HeLa cells. The toxin also shows enterotoxicity in rabbit ileal loops and paralytic lethality in mouse.Heat-stable toxin : Heat-stable toxins (ST) are low- molecular- weight proteins and are of two types: STa and STb. STa is associated with disease in humans. STa is a small, methanol soluble, monomeric toxin that acts by activation of cyclic gua-nosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the intestine. STa binds to guanylate cyclase leading to an increase in the level of cGMP and subsequent increased secretion of fluids. The toxin acts very rapidly and causes accumulation of fluid in the intestines of infant mice within 4 hours of intragastric administration; hence infant mouse is a frequently used animal model for dem-onstration of STa. The toxin also causes accumulation of fluid in the intestine of neonatal but not weaned piglets. STb is not associated with human diseases. STb unlike STa is not methanol soluble. The exact mode of action of STb is not known. The toxin causes accumulation of fluid in ligated intesti-nal loops of young piglets up to 9 weeks' old but not in infant mice. Chap-31.indd (LT) is a heat-labile protein. The toxin was first demonstrated by De and colleagues in 1956 in E. coli isolated from cases of adult diarrhea in adults in Kolkata. They demonstrated the toxin in the bacteria by the rabbit ileal loop method, the method used for detection of the cholera enterotoxin. LT is of two types: LT-I and LT-II. LT-I but not LT-II is associated with human diseases. LT-I is structurally and antigenically similar to cholera toxin. The LT-I toxin consists of one A subunit of molecular weight of 25,000 Da and five identical B subunits, each subunit measur-ing 11,500 Da. The B subunits bind to the GM1 gangliosides, same receptor as cholera toxin, as well as other surface glyco-proteins on epithelial cells in the small intestine. This binding facilitates entry of subunit A into the cell by endocytosis. The A subunit has ADP (adenosine diphosphate)- ribosyl transfer-ase by which a membrane protein (Gs) that regulates adenylate cyclase. This results in an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels leading to an increased secretion of chloride and a decreased absorption of sodium and chloride. This ends in watery diarrhea due to hypersecretion of fluid into the lumen of the gut. The toxin also stimulates secretion of prostaglandin and production of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in further fluid loss. Genes for LT-I and STa are present on I transferable plasmid, which can also carry the genes for adhesins (CFA/I, CFA/II, CFA/III). Pathogenesis of E. coli infections Most infections, such as UTIs and sepsis, are endogenous and are caused by the E. coli present in large numbers in the gastro- intestinal tract of the same host. Other E. coli infections, such as gastroenteritis and neonatal meningitis, are caused by exog-enous infections, i.e., acquired from outside.Urinary tract infections: E. coli serotypes that are normally found in the feces are commonly responsible for urinary tract infections. UTI is an ascending infection in which the bacteria that originate from the intestinal tract contaminate the urethra, ascend into the bladder, and may spread to the kidney or prostate.Nephritogenic strains: Although most strains of E. coli can cause UTI, disease is more common with certain specific E. coli serogroups. These serogroups that cause UTI are known as nephritogenic strains, these E. coli O7, O18, etc. These serotypes UTI, particularly because of their ability to produce adhesins (primarily P pili, AAF/I, AAF/III, and Dr), which bind to cells lining the blad-der and upper urinary tract. This prevents elimination of the bacteria in voided urine. Only one serotype is usually isolated from urine at a time, though recurrences may be due to differ-ent serotypes. They also produce hemolysin HlyA, which lyses erythrocytes and also other cells, leading to release of cytokines and stimulation of an inflammatory response. Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis is caused by exogenous infec- tions acquired from water, food, or vegetables contaminated with fecal E. coli. The strains of E. coli that cause gastroen-teritis are classified into the following six groups: (a) entero-pathogenic E. coli (EPEC), (b) enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), (c) enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), (d) enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), (e) enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and (f) diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) (Table 31-6).Enteropathogenic E. coli: EPEC is the major cause of infant diarrhea in tropical countries. Disease is rare in older children and adults. EPEC adhering to epithelial cells of the small intestine fol-lowed by destruction of the microvillus. The bacteria initially form microcolonies on the epithelial cell surface, in which the bacteria are attached to the host cells with help of cup-like pedestals. This attachment is facilitated by Bfp. This is fol-lowed by secretion of proteins by the bacterial type III secre-tion system into the host epithelial cell. Translocated intimin receptor is inserted into the epithelial cell membrane and Disease Site and mechanisms of action Causative organism Traveler's diarrhea Heat stable/heat labile toxin Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) Acts on small intestine Infant diarrhea Acts on small intestine Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) Dysentery Invasion and destruction of epithelial cellsActs on large intestine Enteroinvasive syndrome (HUS) Acts on large intestine Infant diarrhea Adhesion Acts on small intestine Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) Infant diarrhea Adhesion Acts on small intestine Diffuse aggregative Escherichia coli (DAEC) Chronic diarrheal disease Acts on small intestine Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC)TABLE 31-6 Summary 12:13:43 PMSection Chapter 31COLIFORMS 257 serves as a receptor for intimin, an outer membrane bacterial adhesin of E. coli. Subsequently, the attached bacteria multiply and cause microvilli destruction, resulting in diarrhea due to malabsorption.Enterotoxigenic E. coli: Diarrhea caused by ETEC is endemic in the developing countries, among all age groups of the pop-ulation. This is also responsible for causing traveler's diar-rhea in which individuals from developed countries visiting endemic areas often suffer from ETEC diarrhea. The disease is caused by consumption of fecally contaminated food or water. Person-to-person spread does not occur. Although plas-mids with enterotoxin genes may be present in any strain of E. coli, diarrhea is caused by certain specific produce heat-labile enterotox-ins (LT-I, LT-II). LT-I, which is structurally similar to cholera toxin, produces cholera-like diarrhea in patients. The dis-ease process is facilitated further by the presence of adhesins (primarily P pili, AAF/I, AAF/III, and Dr), which bind intes-tinal mucosa.Enteroinvasive E. coli: EIEC strains closely resemble shigel- ways: (a ) EIEC strains are nonmotile, (b ) they do not ferment lactose or ferment late with production of acid only, and (c ) they do not decarboxylate lysine decarboxylase. These strains show cross-reactivity with O antigen of shigel-lae. These \"atypical\" E. coli strains were named earlier Shigella alkalescens under \"Alkalescens-Dispar Group\" (resembling Shigella flexneri except in fermenting dulcitol and forming alkali in litmus milk) and Shigella dispar (late lactose fermenter like Shigella sonnei but indole positive). Currently, these have been renamed EIEC because they have the capacity to invade inter-stitial epithelial cells and also penetrate HeLa cells in tissue culture. The EIEC strains have the ability to invade and destroy the colonic epithelium, producing a disease characterized ini-tially by watery diarrhea. This ability of E. coli to invade cells is determined by a large plasmid, which codes for outer mem-brane antigens called the \"virulence marker antigens\" (VMA). The bacteria lyse the phagocytes and multiply in the cell cytoplasm. This continuous process of epithelial cell destruction with inflammatory infiltration leads to the development of ulcers in intestine. Specific serogroups commonly associated with out-breaks of are the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections in the developed countries. These strains produce diarrheal disease, ranging in severity from mild uncomplicated diarrhea to fatal hemorrhagic coli-tis. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious life-threatening complication in 10% of infected children below 10 years. The ingestion of as few as 100 bacilli can cause the disease. EHEC disease is most common in children below 5 years and in sum-mer months. The condition occurs as a result of ingestion of water, unpasteurized milk or fruit juices, uncooked vegetables, and fruits contaminated with human or animal feces. The dis-ease also occurs on consumption of undercooked ground beef or other meat products.Serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H1 are the EHEC strains that commonly cause the disease. These strains produce Shiga tox-ins (i.e., Stx-l, Stx-2, or both), which are primarily responsible for the diarrheal diseases. Stx-2 is most commonly associated with HUS, a disorder characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Stx-2 causes destruction of glomerular endothelial cells, result-ing in reduced glomerular filtration and acute renal failure. The toxins also stimulate production of tumor necrosis factor-/H9251 and interleukin-6, which contribute further to the disease process.Enteroaggregative E. coli: EAEC strains are so called because they show a typical \"stacked brick\" arrangement on Hep-2 cells or glass due to their autoagglutination. Bundle-forming fimbriae of the bacteria (such as AAF/I and AAF/II), which are carried on a plasmid, mediate this process. These EAEC strains layer overlying the epithelium of the small intestine. This layer of biofilm traps the bacteria in epithelium of the small intestine. In animal experiments, they cause shortening of the microvilli, mononuclear infiltration, and hemorrhage. These strains are associated with persistent, watery diarrhea with dehydration in infants, especially in devel-oping countries.Diffusely adherent E. coli: DAEC strains cause watery diarrhea found primarily in children between 1 and 5 years of age. These strains are identified by their ability to adhere to cultured cells. They cause elongation of the microvilli with the bacteria trapped in the cell membrane.Septicemia: Invasion of blood stream by E. coli may lead to sep- ticemia. Septicemia is caused by E. coli strains associated with UTIs or intra-abdominal infections, such as peritonitis and abscesses following intestinal perforation. The mortality due to E. coli septicemia is high for patients with immunocompro- mised status, or for patients in whom the primary infection is in the abdomen or central nervous system (CNS).Neonatal meningitis: E. coli along with group B streptococci are the major causes of infection of the CNS in infants of age 1 month. The disease is caused by E. coli strains that pos- sess the KI capsular antigen, which are commonly present in the gastrointestinal tracts of pregnant women and newborn infants. Host immunity Disease caused by EPEC is rare in older children and adults, presumably because they have developed protective immunity. Immunity develops to ETEC surface antigens in local adult populations; hence disease is confined to immunologically na\u00efve travelers and weaning infants. Clinical Syndromes E. coli causes (a) urinary tract infections, (b) gastroenteritis, (c) septicemia, (d) neonatal (e) Chapter 31258 BACTERIOLOGY Urinary tract infections E. coli is the most common bacteria responsible for causing more than 80% of all community-acquired UTI. E. coli cause a wide range of UTIs, including uncomplicated urethritis or urosepsis. Uncomplicated cystitis occurs primarily in sexually active females who are colonized by uro-pathogenic strains of E. coli. Subsequently, the periurethral region is colonized by E. coli due to fecal contamination, and the bacteria reach the urinary bladder during sexual intercourse. Gastroenteritis Different E. coli subtypes cause diarrheal illnesses of various types as follows: EPEC, EAEC, and DAEC cause watery diarrhea and dys-entery. These conditions occur most often in developing countries. EPEC primarily affects infants and children. These strains cause acute watery diarrhea, which may cause dehydration or become chronic and lead to failure to thrive. EAEC and DAEC also cause diarrhea similar to that caused by EPEC. ETEC is distributed widely in areas with poor sanitation and is a ubiquitous contaminant of food and water sources. Hence, ETEC is the primary cause of traveler's diarrhea and the major cause of infantile diarrhea in underdeveloped coun-tries. This is because immunity develops to ETEC surface antigens in local adult populations; hence disease is confined to immunologically na\u00efve travelers and weaning infants. Incu-bation period is short, varies from 1 to 3 days. The condition manifests by the sudden onset of watery diarrhea without blood, mucus, or fecal leukocytes. Vomiting may be present, but most patients typically have no fever. This is a self- limiting condition and persists for less than 5 days. EIEC produces diarrhea and dysentery, disease similar to that caused by Shigella species. These strains cause watery diar-rhea, dysentery, fever, vomiting, painful abdominal cramps, and tenesmus. Stools often contain blood and leukocytes. EHEC is an important cause of food-borne illness, particu-larly in developed countries, such as the United States and Canada. EHEC is a common microbiological flora of the intestine of cattle. Therefore, cattle are the primary reservoir of the EHEC strains that produce diarrhea in humans. The infection is acquired by ingestion of beef products or foods contaminated with cattle feces containing EHEC strains. EHEC cause two distinctive syndromes: hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) by producing two Shiga toxins. The Stx is responsible for the systemic complica-tion and manifestations of the infection.Hemorrhagic colitis: Incubation period varies from 1 to 5 days. The condition manifests as watery diarrhea to severe hemorrhagic colitis. Watery diarrhea is often accompanied by abdominal cramping and vomiting. In most patients, diar-rhea becomes bloody in 1-2 days, but is usually not associated with fecal leukocytes. Fever is present in about a third of cases. The infection typically lasts for 4-10 days. E. coli O157:H7, the most common strain causing EHEC diarrhea, has a small infec-tive dose (around 100 bacilli) and spreads easily from child to child by the fecal-oral route. Gastroenteritis caused by E. coli is summarized in Table 31-6. Key Points Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) Serious life-threatening complication, seen in 10-15% of children with EHEC diarrhea. Important manifestations include (i) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, (ii) thrombocytopenia, and (iii) renal insufficiency. Typically develops in the second week of illness, after recov-ery from diarrhea. Presents with anemia, weakness, irritability, and oliguria or anuria. Chronic renal failure may develop in 10% of patients with HUS. Mortality rate\u2014nearly 3-5%. Stool culture for EHEC is always negative in patients with HUS. Septicemia E. coli causes septicemia, which is usually associated with UTI, especially in cases of urinary obstruction of any cause. The endotoxin or LPSs of the bacteria cause a systemic reaction that can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and even death. Mortality and morbidity associated with E. coli septice-mia are same as that for other aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Neonatal meningitis E. coli is an important cause of meningitis in neonates. In adults, it occurs following neurosurgical procedures, CNS trauma, complicating Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection involving the CNS. Neonatal meningitis has a high mortality rate of 8%. Other infections These include intra-abdominal infections due to E. coli, often resulting from a perforated appendix, diverticulum, or due to intra-abdominal arthritis, endophthalmitis, sinusitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or skin and soft tissue infections are the other pyogenic infections caused by E. coli. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Many strains of diarrheagenic E. coli primarily affect popula-tions in developing countries. There is a wide variation in the prevalence of these strains worldwide. EPEC, EAEC, and DAEC have been reported to occur most often in developing coun-tries. ETEC is the primary cause of traveler's diarrhea and is the major cause of infantile diarrhea in poor and developing Chap-31.indd 258 5/14/2012 12:13:43 PMSection III Chapter 31COLIFORMS 259 countries. ETEC causes nearly more than 600 million cases of diarrhea every year and 700,000 deaths in children below 5 years. EHEC is an emerging cause of food-borne disease, particularly in the northern United States and Canada. Outbreaks of HUS in children that caused fatalities have also been documented in these countries. Habitat Most strains of E. coli causing diseases in humans inhabit the human intestine. Few strains, such as EHEC, inhabit the cattle intestine also. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Most E. coli infections with the exception of neonatal men- ingitis and gastroenteritis are endogenous. The infection is caused by the E. coli that constitute the patient's normal micro- bial flora. These bacteria cause infections, such as UTI, due to poor personal hygiene or when the patient's defenses are compromised. Diarrhea caused by E. coli is widespread in areas with poor sanitation, and infections are exogenous. Food and water contaminated with human or cattle feces are important sources of diarrheagenic E. coli. Ground beef, apple juice, and alfalfa sprouts contaminated with cattle feces are important sources of infection caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (e.g., O157:H7). Infection is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. The usual source of E. coli in neonatal infections is the intestinal tract of the mother. The bacteria may also be acquired nosocomially, particularly in infants who are prema-ture or who require mechanical ventilation. Humans and also cattle (for E. coli O157:H7) are reservoirs of infection. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of E. coli infections is based on 1. Isolation of E. coli by culture. 2. Demonstration of toxins of diarrheagenic E. coli. Specimens Urine is the specimen of choice for diagnosis of UTI caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Clean-voided midstream samples of urine are usually employed for culture. Catheterized urine and urine collected by suprapubic aspiration are also used in certain situ-ations. Urine is a good medium for the growth of coliforms and other urinary pathogens, hence should be sent immediately to microbiology laboratory for processing the specimen. If delay of more than 1-2 hours is unavoidable, the specimen should be refrigerated. Other specimens include feces or rectal swabs for gastroenteritis, blood for septicemia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for meningitis, sputum for pneumonia, or other body fluids, such as pus from wound, biliary and peritoneal abscesses caused by E. coli. Culture Definitive diagnosis is based on the isolation of E. coli from var-ious clinical specimens by culture. Urine culture is a very useful procedure for diagnosis of UTI. Stool culture is widely used to isolate diarrheagenic E. coli. Culture of blood, CSF, and other specimens is also carried out depending on the clinical diseases caused by E. coli, as mentioned earlier.Urine culture: Semiquantitative culture of urine for E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria is the method most commonly used in a microbiology laboratory for identification of the bac-teria from urine. In this method, a predetermined quantity of urine is inoculated on MacConkey and blood agar with a stan-dardized inoculating loop. The loop is calibrated to deliver 0.05 mL of urine; hence 200 loopfuls of urine will deliver 1 mL of urine. The number of colonies that are obtained after overnight incubation of inoculated plates multiplied with 200 will be the approximate number of bacteria per milliliter of urine. For example, if the number of colonies on a MacConkey agar after overnight incubation is 500, the viable bacterial count/mL of urine will be (500 /H11003 200) 100,000 or 10 5. This forms the basis of significant bacteriuria suggested by Kass. After incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C, pink, flat colonies of E. coli on the MacConkey agar and beta-hemolytic colonies on blood agar are identified by various biochemical tests (Box 31-1). Significant bacteriuria concept suggested by Kass is based on the fact that a colony count exceeding 100,000 (10 5) bacteria/mL of urine denotes significant bacteriuria and is suggestive of active UTI. Counts of 10,000 bacteria or less per milliliter are of no significance and are due to contami-nation of urine during voiding. Bacterial counts between 10,000 (10 4) and 100,000 (105) are infrequent when the sample is collected properly and processed promptly. Such results are considered equivocal and the culture is repeated. Key Points The concept of significant bacteriuria is applicable only for E. coli and other Gram-negative bacteria and for midstream urine specimen. It is not applicable for the urine specimens collected directly from urinary bladder by cystoscopy, and also for Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, in which even low counts may be significant. Interpretation of bacteriuria, however, requires caution and should always be with reference to clinical condition of the patient. Because UTI is a common problem and culture facilities are not available everywhere, several simple meth-ods have been introduced for the presumptive diagnosis of 1. Forms lactose fermenting pink colonies on MacConkey medium. 2. Produce a zone of hemolysis around colonies on blood agar. 3. Mostly motile (except EIEC). 4. Ferments lactose, glucose, and other sugars with production of acid and gas (ex cep t sucrose). 5. III Chapter 31260 BACTERIOLOGY significant bacteriuria. These methods have been described in detail in Chapter 77. After incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C, pink, flat colonies of E. coli on the MacConkey agar and beta-hemolytic colo- nies on blood agar are by various biochemical tests (Box 31-1).Other specimens for culture: CSF culture positive for E. coli establishes the diagnosis of E. coli meningitis. Isolation of the organism from blood, pus, and other specimens is definitive for diagnosis of infections caused by E. coli. Demonstration of toxins of diarrheagenic E. coli Laboratory diagnosis of diarrhea caused by diarrheagenic E. coli can be made by demonstration of the bacilli in feces by culture. The feces is collected from the patient in a sterile container and sent immediately to the laboratory. The fecal samples are inoculated directly on MacConkey and blood agar media. The plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight and looked for the char-acteristic lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey and beta-hemolytic colonies on blood agar as described earlier. Since E. coli is present as commensals in the intestine\u2014hence is detected even in normal stool\u2014it is essential to perform various diagnostic tests in order to consider it as diarrhea-genic pathogenic E. coli strain. These strains are identified by (a) serotyping, (b) animal inoculation, (c) cytopathic effects in cell cultures, or (d) molecular methods.Identification of EPEC: Specific associated with outbreaks of EPEC. Therefore, E. coli colonies isolated from feces on MacConkey agar are identified by agglutination tests with specific poly-valent and monovalent antisera. In this method, a saline suspension of E. coli colonies is made on the slide and mixed with a drop of specific polyvalent and monovalent antisera against EPEC serogroups. At least 10 colonies per plate should be tested. If isolated colonies are negative, the con-fluent growth is emulsified and tested. In a positive test, if E. coli colonies show agglutination with a specific serogroup (for example, O111) then the isolate is identified as E. coli of that serogroup (O111).Identification of ETEC: Diagnosis of ETEC diarrhea depends on the demonstration of enterotoxin in E. coli isolates from stool, because toxin production is not associated with specific serogroups of E. coli. A strain of ETEC may produce either LT or ST, or both. Many tests are available for demonstration of the LT or ST produced by ETEC. These tests, therefore, are used for detection and identification of E. coli isolates from stool as ETEC (Table 31-7). 1. The presence of LT in isolates of E. coli can be demonstrated by: Showing fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop method. Showing vascular permeability factor of the toxin in adult rabbit skin method. Tissue culture tests (rounding of Y1 mouse adrenal cells and elongation of Chinese hamster ovary cells [CHO] cells due to intracellular increase of cAMP concentration). Serological tests (agar gel diffusion, reverse passive hem-agglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Genetic probes. These are available for detection of LT in E. coli isolates from stool cultures, or directly in feces. 2. The presence of ST in isolates of E. coli can be demonstrated by: Infant mouse test\u2014it is still widely employed for detec-tion of ST in isolates of E. coli. Genetic probes\u2014for detection of ST in E. coli isolates from stool cultures, or directly in feces. Identification of EIEC: Many of the EIEC strains are atypical E. coli strains. They are nonmotile and do not ferment lactose, or ferment it late with production of acid, but without produc-ing any gas. They also do not decarboxylate lysine. EIEC are identified by: Sereny test: The test is carried out in guinea pigs by instillation of isolated EIEC into the conjunctival sac of guinea pigs. The animal is examined after 72 hours for mucopurulent conjunc-tivitis and severe keratitis.Cell culture test: The toxin can be demonstrated in HeLa or HEP-2 cells. The bacterial suspension is added to a monolayer Type of toxin of Escherichia coliIn vivo tests In vitro tests Heat labile toxin (LT) Injection into closed ligated rabbit ileal loops produces outpouring of fluid and ballooning of the loopsIncreases skin capillary permeability in adult rabbit skin (vascular permeability steroid production elongation of Chinese Hamster ovary cellsELISADNA probes Heat stable toxin (ST) Induces fluid accumulation in the intestines of infant mice within 4 hours of intragastric administration.Induces fluid accumulation in the intestinal loops of neonates but not weaned pigletsST - ELISA DNA probesTABLE 31-7 Methods of detection of LT and ST of Escherichia coli Chap-31.indd 260 5/14/2012 12:13:43 PMSection III Chapter 31COLIFORMS 261 of the cells. The cells are then examined for the presence of intracellular E. coli because EIEC, if present, penetrate these cells and replicate inside the cells.VMA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: This is a serological test used to detect the plasmid, which codes for outer mem-brane antigens called the VMA, in stool isolates of EIEC.Identification of EHEC: E. coli O157:H7 is the most common serotype associated with the clinical disease caused by EHEC strains. The strain typically does not ferment sorbitol; hence sorbitol MacConkey medium is frequently used for isolation of the strain from stool by culture. Identification of EHEC strains is by: Demonstrating cytotoxic effects of EHEC on Vero or HeLa cells. Using DNA probes for VT1 and VT2 genes in EHEC directly in feces or in culture isolates. Identification of other strains: EAEC strains are identified by agglutination tests with specific antisera. Most of them are not typed by O antisera, but by specific H antisera. Treatment E. coli isolated from community-acquired infections are usu-ally sensitive to commonly used antibiotics except penicillins. Hospital-acquired E. coli isolates, however, show multidrug resistance. Majority of E. coli infections are best treated based on antibiotics susceptibility testing results. UTI and neo-natal sepsis are treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Treatment of bacterial gastroenteritis is primarily supportive. Antibiotic therapy is rarely indicated and is deferred until cul-ture results are available. Presumptive therapy is not given due to the potential risks associated with antibiotic treatment for diarrhea caused by E. coli O157:H7. Third-generation cephalo-sporins, such as ceftriaxone, are recommended for meningitis and pneumonia caused by E. coli. Prevention and Control Availability of safe drinking water, proper food hygiene, and sanitary disposal of excreta are the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the incidence of enteric infections caused by E. coli. Cooking ground beef thoroughly is the most effective way to prevent hemorrhagic colitis caused by E. coli O157:H7. Edwardsiella The genus Edwardsiella differs from the genus Escherichia by its ability to produce hydrogen sulfide. The genus Edwardsiella includes Edwardsiella tarda, the only pathogenic species for humans. E. tarda inhabits the intestines of snakes and other cold-blooded animals. The name tarda refers to slow or weak fer- mentation of sugars by the bacteria. E. tarda is a Gram-negative, noncapsulated, motile bacillus with weak fermentative powers. It ferments only glucose and maltose with production of acid and some gas. It is indole, H 2S, and citrate positive, and it decar- boxylates lysine and ornithine. E. tarda is an occasional human pathogen isolated from wounds, blood, and CSF in cases of fatal meningitis. The bacteria have also been isolated from stool of normal healthy people and that of patients with diarrhea. Nevertheless, the pathogenic role of the bacteria in causation of diarrhea is yet to be established. Citrobacter Citrobacter is a normal inhabitant of the intestine of humans. The genus Citrobacter consists of three species, namely, Citrobacter grow well on nutrient agar and other ordinary media producing smooth and convex col-onies. The colonies are not pigmented. On MacConkey and DCA media, they produce pale colonies. Citrobacter spp. are motile, H 2S positive, MR positive, citrate positive, and indole variable. They do not decarboxylate lysine, but most strains decarboxylate ornithine. They ferment lactose late or do not ferment at all. Differences between three species in their biochemical characteristics are summarized in Table 31-8. They show extensive antigenic sharing with salmonellae, hence may be mistaken for salmonellae. Certain strains pos-sess a Vi antigen, closely related to the antigen of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi. Citrobacter spp. may cause infections of the urinary tract, gall bladder, and middle ear and meninges. C. koseri may occasionally cause meningitis in neonates. Klebsiella The genus Klebsiella belongs to the tribe Klebsielleae in the family Enterobacteriaceae. The bacteria are named after Edwin Klebs, who demonstrated the bacteria for the first time. Members of the genus Klebsiella are Gram-negative, rod-shaped, nonmotile bacteria, with a prominent polysaccharide capsule. The classification of Klebsiella has undergone various modifications. Earlier, the genus Klebsiella, based on biochemi-cal reactions, was classified into three main 5/14/2012 12:13:43 PMSection III Chapter 31262 BACTERIOLOGY based on DNA homology, they have been divided into seven species, namely: (a) ornithinolytica. In recent years, Klebsielleae organisms are emerging as important agents of nosocomial infections. K. pneumoniae is the most important species of the group to cause infections in humans. K. oxytoca and K. rhinoscleromatis have also been occa- sionally associated with human infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae, also known as Friedlander's bacillus, was first iso-lated by Friedlander in 1883, from fatal cases of pneumonia. K. pneumoniae are Gram-negative, short and straight rods mea-suring about 1-2 /H11003 0.5-0.8 /H9262 m in size. They are nonmotile and nonsporing. They are arranged singly or in pairs. Freshly iso-lated strains show a well-defined polysaccharide capsule. The capsule is often prominent and can be made out even in Gram-stained smears as haloes around the bacilli, and is produced well when grown in media enriched with carbohydrates. The capsule can also be demonstrated by India ink preparation and Quellung's reaction. Accumulation of extracellular polysaccha-rides as a loose slime gives mucoid appearance to Klebsiella colo-nies. They are fimbriated, and most strains possess one or more of three types of fimbriae: types 1, 3, and 6. They are nonmotile and nonsporing. They are lactose-fermenting, urease- positive, and indole-negative organisms; however, some strains of K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca are exceptions. They do not pro-duce hydrogen sulphide, and they are both VP and MR tests positive. They grow well on ordinary media, such as nutri-ent agar and MacConkey agar at 37\u00b0C, forming large, dome- produce lactose-fermenting LPSs (O antigens). The members of Klebsielleae have been classified into over 80 serotypes based on the capsular K antigens and somatic O antigens. All serotypes are of the same virulence. Klebsielleae consists of invasive bacteria. They possess many virulence factors: 1. Capsule is the main virulence factor. The capsule pre- v ents the bacteria from phagocytosis by polymorpho- nuclear granulocytes. The capsule also prevents bacterial death caused by bactericidal serum factors by inhibiting the activation or uptake of complement components, especially C3b. 2. Multiple adhesins are other virulence factors. These adhesins help the bacteria to adhere to host cells, which is crucial to initiate the disease process. 3. LPS is another factor that prevents membrane damage and death of bacteria. The LPS of the bacteria activates the com plement, which causes selective deposition of C3b onto LPS molecules at sites away from cell membrane of the bacteria. This inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9), which is responsible for cell death of the bacteria.Klebsielleae organisms cause a variety of clinical syndromes in humans. These are (a) community-acquired pneumonia, (b) UTI, (c) nosocomial infection, and (d) bacteremia and sepsis. 1. Community-acquired pneumonia is a v er y serious con- dition with a rapid onset and often fatal outcome despite early and appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Lobar pneumonia characteristically is associated with massive mucoid inflammatory exudate of lobar or lobular distribu-tion, involving one or more lobes of the lung. Necrosis and abscess formation are more frequent than in pneumococ-cal pneumonia. K. pneumoniae serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are usu-ally associated with the condition. Patients present with an acute onset of high fever and chills, flu-like symptoms, and productive cough with abundant, thick, tenacious, and blood-tinged sputum. Blood culture is positive in about 25% of the cases. 2. UTI caused by K. pneumoniae is a common problem in patients with indwelling cathe ters. UTIs caused by K. pneumoniae cannot be distinguished clinically from those caused by E. coli and other common bacteria. 3. K. pneumoniae are emerging as impor tant agents of noso- comial infections in hospitals. The presence of invasive devices, contamination of respiratory support equipment, use of urinary catheters, and use of antibiotics greatly increases the likelihood of nosocomial infections in hos-pitalized patients. In addition, poor health status and treatment in an intensive care unit or nursing home are other factors. UTI, pneumonia, bacteremia, wound infec-tion, cholecystitis, and catheter-associated bacteriuria are the common nosocomial infections associated with K. pneumoniae. Other rare nosocomial infections cholangitis, meningitis, endocarditis, and endophthalmitis. bacteremia and sepsis produce clinical manif es- tations similar to those caused by E. coli and other Gram- negative enteric organisms. In neonatal units, outbreaks of infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella strains present a more serious problem and may be associated with high mortality. ESBL strains of Klebsiella show the following features: (a) these are highly virulent, (b) they possess capsular type K55 antigen, and (c) they have an extraordinary ability to spread. Diagnosis of K. pneumoniae infection is made by isolation of bacteria from clinical specimens obtained from possible sites (e.g., wounds, peripheral or central intravenous access sites, urinary catheters, respiratory support equipment) and by culture (Fig. 31-4, Color Photo 32). Klebsiella organisms may also be isolated from urine, blood, pleural fluid, and wounds. Serological tests are not useful for the detection of infection with K. pneumoniae. The choice of a specific antimicrobial agent depends on antibiotics susceptibility patterns of isolated strains. A wide range of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and other antibiotics are useful for treatment of Klebsiella infec- tions. Cephalosporins are 5/14/2012 12:13:43 PMSection III Chapter 31COLIFORMS 263 in combination with aminoglycosides. Cephalosporins are not used for ESBL strains of K. pneumoniae. The carbapenems, especially imipenem, are effective against such ESBL strains. Aztreonam and quinolones are recommended for patients allergic to penicillin. Hand washing holds the key to prevent transmission from patient to patient via medical personnel. Contact isolation is useful for patients colonized or infected with highly antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella strains, such as ESBL-K. pneumoniae. Key Points Susceptibility of isolated ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae is determined by various methods: Disk diffusion test is performed using cefotaxime and cef-tazidime disks and those containing a combination of cla-vulanic acid with these antibiotics. These discs are placed on Mueller-Hinton agar. A 5 mm or greater increase in the size of the zone diameter for either cefotaxime or ceftazidime tested in combination with clavulanic acid versus the zone for either antibiotic tested alone indicates a positive test. E-test is another method performed to evaluate third- generation cephalosporins with and without a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis Rhinoscleroma caused by K. rhinoscleromatis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the nasopharynx. Infection with K. rhinoscleromatis has a worldwide distribution and is usually observed in areas of southeastern Europe, Central America, and India. Patients present with a purulent nasal discharge with formation of crusts and nodules that may lead to respiratory obstruction. The bacilli are seen intracellularly in lesions, which can be isolated and identified by biochemi-cal reactions. Diagnosis is by positive blood culture supple-mented with histology. Rifampin has been used for treatment of rhinoscleroma.Klebsiella ozaenae Ozena, caused by K. ozaenae, is a chronic characterized by necrosis of nasal mucosa and mucopuru-lent nasal discharge. It often occurs in elderly persons. Nasal congestion and a constant nasal bad smell are the common symptoms. However, unlike rhinoscleroma, nasal conges-tion is not a prominent feature. Patients may also complain of headache and symptoms attributable to chronic sinus-itis. Identification of K. ozaenae is difficult due to wide variations in the biochemical reactions of isolated strains. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are used for treatment of ozena. Klebsiella oxytoca K. oxytoca may be rarely isolated from clinical specimens. It is being increasingly isolated from patients with neo-natal septicemia. The bacteria have also been associated with neonatal bacteremia, especially among premature infants and in neonatal intensive care units. The biochemi-cal reactions of different Klebsiella species are summarized in Table 31-9. Enterobacter The genus Enterobacter includes 12 species, of , followed by Enterobacter saka- zakii are the most frequently isolated species causing human infections. Other species rarely associated with human infec-tions are two most important Enterobacter species respon-sible for a variety of nosocomial infections. Differences between E. cloacae and E. aerogenes are summarized in which belong to the tribe Klebsielleae, and are aerobic and facultatively anaerobic. On sheep blood agar, Enterobacter produces large, dry or mucoid colonies; on MacConkey agar, lactose-fermenting pink colonies. The bacteria ferment glucose with production of acid. They differ from Klebsiella by being motile, urease- negative, and ornithine decarboxylase-positive. Endotoxin of the bacteria is known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and its complications. Enterobacter species rarely cause disease in otherwise healthy people. These are opportunistic pathogens. The patients who stay in hospital, especially in the ICU, for prolonged periods are at high risk to aquire Enterobacter infections. The patients treated earlier with antimicrobial agents and those with seri-ous underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, malignancies, burns, mechanical ventilation), with foreign devices (e.g., such as intravenous catheters), and with immunosuppression are also at increased risk of infection by the bacteria. In these patients, they cause frequent and severe nosoco- mial infections, such as UTIs, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. These infections are associated with: prolonged hospitalization, use of a variety of different surgical and nonsurgical proce-dures, and use of recent and expensive antimicrobial agents. These bacteria cause significant morbidity and mortality, and infection management is complicated by multiple antibiotic resistances shown by the bacteria. These bacteria possess induc-ible beta-lactamases, which are not detectable in vitro, but are responsible for resistance during treatment. The sources of infection may be endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous Enterobacter infections originate from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract colonized by the bacteria. The hands of medical personnel, intravenous solutions, endoscopes, blood products, devices for monitoring intra-arterial pressure, and stethoscopes are the frequently reported sources for exogenous infections caused by Enterobacter. Diagnosis is made by repeated culture from appropriate clini-cal specimens. Blood culture is useful in isolation of the from frequently used antibiotics against Enterobacter infections. Third-generation cephalosporins frequently show good in vitro activity against these organisms, but are associated with an increased risk of developing full resistance during therapy. Carbapenems show the best activity against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and other species. First-generation and second-generation cephalosporins are not used against infections caused by Enterobacter. Hafnia Hafnia alvei is the only species of the genus Hafnia. It is found in human and animal feces, sewage, soil, and water. H. alvei is motile. It does not ferment lactose, raffinose, sucrose, adonitol dulcitol, and inositol. It is indole and MR negative, and VP and citrate positive. Biochemical reactions are better read on incu-bation at 22\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C. The bacteria have been isolated from abscesses, wounds, sputum, urine, blood, and from other sites, but often with other bacteria. The pathogenic role of H. alvei is yet to be established. Serratia Serratia are Gram-negative bacteria classified in the tribe Klebsielleae. Serratia marcescens is the only pathogenic species causing human infection. S. marcescens\u2014as a causative agent of a bloody discoloration in Bartolomeo Bizio, a pharmacist from Padua, Italy, in 1819. The bacterium was named Serratia in honor of an Italian physicist named Serrati, who invented the steam-boat. The species name marcescens is derived from the Latin word meaning decaying due to fast-deteriorating nature of the bloody pigment produced by the bacteria. Since the 1960s, S. marcescens been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen causing infection in humans. Some strains of S. marcescens typically produce a nondiffusible pigment called prodigi-osin, which varies in color from dark red to pink or magenta, depending on the age of the colonies. S. marcescens usually grows on starchy foodstuffs, where the production of pig-mented colonies is easily mistaken for drops of blood. S. marc- escens are pleomorphic with minute coccobacillary and normal bacillary forms. In the hospital, Serratia usually colonizes the respiratory and urinary tracts of adult patients. The bacteria is responsi-ble for nearly 2% of nosocomial infections of the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, surgical wounds, blood, and skin and soft tissues of these patients. S. marcescens has been associated with outbreaks of meningitis, wound infections, and arthritis in pediatric wards, and in the intensive care units. The bacteria also causes endocarditis and osteomyelitis in people addicted to intravenous drugs, such as heroin. Older people, patients Properties PMSection III Chapter 31COLIFORMS 265 with previous antibiotic treatment and chronic or debilitat-ing diseases are at increased risks for severe infections with Serratia. S. marcescens is sensitive to amikacin and quinolones but is resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. The bacte-ria are naturally resistant to ampicillin, macrolides, and first-generation cephalosporins. Therefore, treatment of S. marcescens is based on the results of antibiotics suscepti-bility testing. Proteus The genus Proteus along with two other genera Morganella and Providencia belongs to the tribe Proteeae. The name \"Proteus \" (after the Greek god Proteus who could assume any shape) refers to their property of pleomorphism. All the members of the tribe Proteeae with few exceptions are Gram negative, noncapsulated, pleomorphic, and motile bacilli. Most of these bacteria, except for some strains of Providencia, produce the enzyme urease which rapidly hydrolyses urea to form ammo-nia and carbon dioxide. They are MR positive and VP nega-tive, degrade tyrosine, and grow in the presence of KCN. They do not decarboxylate amino acids, such as arginine or lysine or dehydrogenase ornithine. They do not ferment lactose or dulcitol, and do not utilize malonate. The formation of the phenyl ala-nine to phenyl pyruvic acid (PPA reaction), is the characteristic feature of the tribe Proteeae by which they are differentiated from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The dif-ferentiating features of different genera in the tribe Proteeae are summarized in Table 31-11. most important species, which causes 90% of Proteus infections and is associated with community-acquired urinary tract and wound infection. P. vulgaris and P. penneri are usually associ-ated with hospital-acquired infections. They are isolated from patients with chronic debilitating diseases and from those who are immunocompromised.Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Proteus shows following measuring 1-3 /H11003 0.6 /H9262m in size. They are arranged as single, in pairs, or in short chains. Many of them form long, curved, and filamentous forms in young cultures. Most of them, with few exceptions, are motile due to the presence of peritrichous flagella. They are fimbriated. Culture Proteeae organisms are aerobic bacteria, which grow well on ordi-nary media, such as nutrient agar. Proteus colonies on or \"seminal\") odor.Swarming: P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris typically spread or swarm on surface of the medium. They spread on the surface of the plate in successive waves to form a thin filmy layer in concen-tric circles. This is known as swarming (Fig. 31-5, Color Photo 33). The exact mechanism responsible for swarming shown by Proteus species is not known. Swarming, shown by Proteus , is a problem when mixed growth on a solid medium is obtained in which Proteus bacilli are present with other bacteria. Hence, sev- eral methods are available to inhibit swarming; these include the use of increased concentration of agar in the medium from 1-2% to 6%, and the agents, or boric acid (1:1000). Swarming does not occur on MacConkey medium, on which Proteus produces colorless non-lactose-fermenting colonies. It is because bile salts present in the MacConkey medium inhibit the swarming. Biochemical properties Proteus shows following reactions: Proteus species ferment glucose with production of acid only. They are urease and PPA 12:13:44 PMSection but do not utilize malonate. They do not decarboxylate amino acids, such as lysine or arginine. Proteus species show variable reactions in the production of hydrogen sulfide and indole. P. mirabilis is indole negative, while P. vulgaris is indole positive. Biochemical characteristics of Proteus species are summarized in Table 31-11. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Properties Motile Proteus Somatic O antigens are heat-stable proteins, which are resistant to heating at 100 \u00b0C. They are also resistant to treat-ment with ethanol and dilute hydrochloric acid. Thirty two dif-ferent O antigens are found in P. mirabilis, 22 in P. vulgaris, and five in P. penneri and P. myxofaciens. The O antigen contains both alkali-labile and alkali-stable fractions. The alkali-stable component is polysaccharide in nature and shows cross-reactivity with certain rickettsial antigens. The sharing of antigens with rickettsial antigens was first observed by Weil and Felix. They observed that certain nonmotile strains of P. vulgaris called the \"X strains\" were agglutinated by sera from typhus fever patients. This heterophilic agglutination by certain Proteus strains formed the basis of the Weil-Felix reaction for the diagnosis of some rickettsial infections. test. Flagellar antigens heat-labile proteins sensitive to etha-nol and to dilute hydrochloric acid. On the basis of their O antigens, P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris have been classified into 54 O groups. These O groups are further subdivided into a large number of O types depending on their flagellar or H antigens. FIG. 31-5. Proteus spp. showing swarming on the blood agar.Pathogenesis and Immunity Proteus organisms are invasive bacteria. Virulence factors Proteus possesses following virulence factors: Pili: Fimbriae or pili are the important virulence factors that facilitate adherence of P. mirabilis bacteria to host tissue sites, such as the urinary tract epithelium.LPS or endotoxin: This causes a series of host inflammatory responses and is responsible for Gram-negative endotoxin-induced sepsis caused by Proteus species. Urease production: The ability of Proteus organisms to produce urease is an important factor in pathogenesis of UTI caused by Proteus species. Hydrolysis of urea to ammonia makes the urine alkaline, which provides a suitable environment for Proteus to survive. Subsequently, alkalization of urine leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, which in turn leads to for-mation of stones in renal calculi. These stones are composed of a combination of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate\u2014apatite. Pathogenesis of UTI Pathogenesis of Proteus infection depends on the interac- tion between the bacteria and the host defense mechanisms. Adherence of the bacteria to host tissue mediated by fimbriae is the first step in the disease process. The attachment of Proteus species to uroepithelial cells causes secretion of Proteus also induces apoptosis and desqua- mation of epithelial cells. The infection of the urinary tract is facilitated further by production of the enzyme urease and also motility of the bacteria. Urease splits urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia/ammonium buffer pair has a pH of 9.0, leading to excretion of highly alkaline urine, rich in ammonia. The alkalinity of urine contributes to production of renal stones, which is characteristically observed in patients suffering from UTI due to Proteus species. Clinical Syndromes Patients with multiple antibiotic treatments, urinary tract obstruction, or infection developing after catheterization or instrumentation frequently become infected with Proteus spp. or other bacteria, infections, and other miscel- laneous infections. Urinary tract infections UTIs are the most common clinical manifestation of Proteus infections. Proteus is responsible for nearly 1-2% of UTIs in healthy women and 5% of hospital-acquired UTIs. It is responsible for 20-45% of UTIs associated with catheteriza-tion. Patients with UTI with cystitis, prostatitis, or pyelonephritis. Chronic UTI is associated with chronic, recurring stones. Urine sediments show multiple mag-nesium ammonium phosphate crystals. Hospital-acquired infections Hospital-acquired infections are usually transmitted from attending doctors or other healthcare workers and are caused by interruption of the closed sterile system by hospital staff. Miscellaneous infections Proteus species is an important agent of wound infections. The species also causes infection of the umbilical stump in neo-nates, which often leads to sepsis neonatorum, spp. condition which involves subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle. This condition usually occurs in association with other aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (E. coli, Klebsiella spp., or of Pseudomonas can cause Gram-negative endotoxin-induced sepsis, resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which has a mortality rate of 20-50%. Epidemiology Proteus infections are found worldwide. They are opportunistic pathogens, responsible for urinary and hospital-acquired infec-tions. Proteus is widely distributed as saprophytes in nature. They are commonly found in sewage, in manure soil, in human and animal feces, and in decomposing animal products. Proteus species are most commonly found as part of normal human intestinal flora, along with E. coli and Klebsiella species. They are also present on the moist areas of the skin. In hospital settings, they most commonly colonize the skin and oral mucosa of patients and hospital personnel. Infection to patients primar-ily occurs from these reservoirs. Typing Proteus species can be typed by ( a) serotyping, (b) phage typing, (c) bacteriocin (proticin) typing, and (d) Dienes typing. Proticin typing is frequently carried out by using 12 standard proticin-producing strains, and most of the Proteus strains are typeable by this method. Key Points Dienes typing It is used to determine the identity or nonidentity of strains of Proteus . This is based on the observations that when two identical strains of Proteus are inoculated at two different sites on a solid agar that does not inhibit swarming, then those two strains show swarming, which coalesce together without any demarcation. However, if the strains are not identical, then the swarming strains do not coalesce together, instead are sepa-rated from each other with a clearly visible furrow between swarming of the two. This is known as Dienes phenomenon.Laboratory Diagnosis Urine is the specimen of choice for diagnosis of UTIs. Urine is collected in the same way as described earlier for UTI caused by E. coli. Other specimens are collected depending on the nature of infections. These include pus for wound infections, blood for septicemia, CSF for meningitis, etc. Definitive diagnosis is based on the isolation of Proteus spp. from various clinical specimens by culture. Urine culture is carried out in the same way as described earlier for E. coli and other Gram-negative bac-teria. After incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C, pale, nonlactose-fer-menting colonies of Proteus on the MacConckey agar and those on blood agar are identified by various biochemical tests and agglutination reactions (Table 31-11). Culture of blood, CSF, and other specimens is also carried out depending on the clini-cal diseases caused by Proteus. Treatment The choice of a specific antimicrobial agent depends on anti-biotics susceptibility patterns of isolated strains. P. mirabilis is susceptible to nearly all antimicrobials except tetracycline. P. mirabilis is cephalosporins; imipenem; and aztreonam. Resistance to these antibiotics is not a significant problem; only 10-20% of strains develop resistance to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. Development of resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams is uncommon. P. vulgaris and P. and first-generation cephalosporins. The resis-tance is mediated by activation of an inducible chromosomal beta-lactamase occurring in up to 30% of these strains. Prevention and Control Hand washing holds the key to prevent transmission from patient to patient via medical personnel. A vaccine derived from purified mannose-resistant/Proteus-like (MR/P) fimbriae proteins has been evaluated to prevent infection in experimen-tal mouse models and is still under clinical research. The vac-cine is yet to be evaluated in humans. Morganella The genus Morganella belongs to the tribe Proteeae. The genus Morganella has only one species, Morganella morganii with two subspecies, morganii and sibonii. M. morganii ear- small, Gram-negative, motile bacilli, but unlike Proteus species do not produce swarming on the solid media. They are faculta-tively anaerobic and nonencapsulated. They grow on blood agar or on MacConkey agar. They are oxidase negative and catalase and indole decarboxylate ornithine, hydrolyze urease, and reduce nitrates. They do not liquefy gelatin and do not produce hydrogen sulfide. M. morganii is commonly found in human and animal feces and rarely causes severe invasive dis-eases. It is most often found as an opportunistic pathogen in patients who are hospitalized, particularly those on prolonged antibiotic therapy. M. morganii causes UTIs, which are often associated with an alkaline urine pH. The bacteria have also been occasionally reported to cause sepsis, pneumonia, wound infections, pericarditis, chorioamnionitis, endophthalmitis, meropenem, piperacillin, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. These to ceftazidime and other third-generation cephalosporins. ESBL-producing strains of M. morganii have been reported recently. Providencia The genus but do not show swarming on solid media. They produce a fruity smell and on DCA form yellow to orange colo-nies. All the species typically deaminate phenylalanine; only P. rettgeri hydrolyses urea consistently. Other of Providencia are summarized in Table 31-11. Providencia species have been isolated from urine, stool, and blood, as well as from the throat, perineum, axilla, and wounds from humans. P. stuartii is the most common species causing infection in humans. P. stuartii and, to a lesser extent, P. rettgeri are commonly found in patients with long-term indwelling urinary catheters. Older people are at higher risk of infection by P. stuartii or P. rettgeri, because these infections are associated with the use of urinary catheters, and the use of such catheters is much more common in the older people. P. stuartii constitutes nearly 60% of all bacterial pathogens isolated from urine of these patients. P. stuartii possesses an adhesin, mannose-resistant/Klebsiella-like (MR/K) hemagglutinin protein, which allows it to adhere to the urinary catheter. From urine, P. stuartii may invade to blood, causing infection of the blood stream, which is common in elderly patients and in immunocompromised patients. P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, and P. stuartii also may cause inva- sive diarrhea. These species are emerging as important causes of traveler's diarrhea in adults. Diagnosis of UTI and diarrhea is made by routine urine and feces culture. Blood culture is useful for diagnosis of suspected blood stream infections. Antibiotics susceptibility testing is useful for treatment with suitable antibiotics, because many Providencia species show resistance to multiple antibiotics. P. stuartii is the most resistant species of all Providencia spe- cies. It is and carbapenems. P. alcalifaciens and P. rustigianii are usually susceptible to antibiotics. They usually are susceptible to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, late-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, penicillins, and cephalosporins. Erwinia Erwinia organisms are usually found in soils and they cause infection in plants. Erwinia herbicola is the only species that has occasionally been isolated from respiratory and urinary infections in chronic debilitated patients and in hospitalized patients. A 19-year-old female medical student visited medicine OPD complaining of a burning sensation when passing urine and increased frequency of passing urine. The consultant advised for a culture of urine before prescribing any antibiotics. What is the infection? What is the best urine specimen to be collected for culture? What is significant bacteriuria?

They colonize virtually all animals including poultry, birds, livestock, reptiles, rodents, domesticated animals, and humans. Salmonella infections in humans typically produce one of three clinical syndromes, such as gastroenteritis, enteric fever, or focal disease. In addition, Salmonella infection in animals causes substantial losses of livestock. Salmonella Salmonella spp. include Gram-negative, flagellated, and facul-tative anaerobic bacilli characterized by the presence of O, H, and Vi antigens. The taxonomic classification of the genus Salmonella is complex and problematic: Based on DNA homology and host range, the genus Salmo-nella is classified into two species: Salmonella Enterica and Salmonella Bongori. S. Enterica is further subdivided into six subspecies I, II, IIa, IIIb, IV, and VI. Most of the salmonellae that are pathogenic to human beings belong to the subgroup I of S. Enterica subsp. enterica. This includes the typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli and most other serotypes responsible for diseases in mammals. Additionally, each of the Salmonella isolates is serotyped according to the presence of particular somatic O, flagel-lar H, and surface Vi antigens. Presently more than 2400 serotypes are described. The salmonella serotype is unique in the sense that each Salmonella serotype is considered as a species. Salmonellae serotypes are named as, for example, S. Enterica subsp. enterica serotype Enteritidis. However, for the sake of convenience, it is abbreviated as S. Enteritidis (this chapter follows the same system) or just Enteritidis for use in clinical situations. In addition, serotypes are not mentioned in italic but in Roman. Human infections caused by Salmonella spp. are summarized in Table 32-1. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Salmonellae are Gram-negative bacilli measuring 1-3 /H9262m in motile with the presence of peritrichous flagella (Salmonella Gallinarum and Salmonella Pullorum are exceptions, which are nonmotile). They do not form spores and capsules. Some strains of salmonellae may produce fimbriae, but most strains of Salmonella Paratyphi A and few strains of Salmonella Paratyphi B, Salmonella Typhi, and Salmonella Typhimurium are nonfimbriated. Culture They are aerobic and facultatively anaerobic; they grow at an optimum temperature of 37\u00baC in a pH of 6-8 on a variety of nonselective (Mueller-Hinton agar) and selective (Wilson and Blair's and blood agar , Salmonella spp. produce gray white moist colonies with smooth convex surface after 18-24 hours of incuba-tion. Rough strains produce opaque and granular colonies with irregular surface. Some strains of S. Paratyphi B produce large mucoid colonies due to the production of loose polysaccharide slime. On MacConkey agar, they produce pale colorless colonies because they do not fer-ment lactose. S. Typhi do not grow on this medium. The colonies on deoxycholate citrate agar are similar to those produced on MacConkey agar. Sometimes after incuba-tion of 48 hours or more, they produce colonies with a black center. 2. Selective solid media: Wilson and Blair's bismuth sulfite agar is the medium of choice for Salmonella spp., especially Bacteria Diseases Salmonella Typhi Typhoid fever, Salmonella bacteremia Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C Paratyphoid fever, Salmonella bacteremia Salmonella Cholerasuis Salmonella bacteremia Salmonella Virchow Salmonella gastroenteritis Salmonella Seftenberg Salmonella gastroenteritis Salmonella Indiana Salmonella Salmonella Newport Salmonella gastroenteritis Salmonella Anatum Salmonella spp., Proteus spp., and coliforms is inhibited on this medium. On this medium, salmonellae produce jet black colonies surrounded by a metallic sheen due to production of hydrogen sulphide. S. Paratyphi A and other species, which do not produce H 2S, form green colonies. XLD (xylose, lysine deoxycholate agar) is another selective medium used for isolation of Salmonella spp. On this medium, Salmonella spp. produce pink colonies with black centers as a result of H 2S produc- tion. H2S-negative Salmonella serotypes produce red colo- centers. Liquid media: Selenite F and tetrathionate broth are commonly used enrichment media. Selenite F broth is fre-quently used for enrichment of Salmonella spp. from clini- cal specimens. However, sometimes this medium inhibits growth of some salmonellae, such as S. Paratyphi B and Salmonella Choleraesuis. Tetrathionate broth, although is used for salmonellae but at times the broth allows the growth of Shigella spp. and also that of Proteus spp. Tet- rathionate broth with brilliant green, although inhibits the growth of Proteus spp., sometimes is inhibitory to Salmonella spp. Biochemical following reactions: 1. Salmonellae ferment glucose, mannitol, and maltose, forming acid and gas. S. Typhi is an exception, which does not ferment the sugars. 2. They do not ferment lactose, sucrose, or salicin. 3. They do not produce indole. 4. Most salmonellae except S. Paratyphi A, S. Choleraesuis, and some other species produce H2S. 5. They do not hydrolyze urea. They are MR positive and VP negative and citrate positiv e. S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi, however, do not grow in Simmon's citrate media as they need tryptophan as the growth factor. 6. Salmonellae decarboxylate lysine, ornithine, and arginine, but not Typhi do not decarbox- ylate ornithine S. Paratyphi A does not decarboxylate lysine. 7. Salmonellae are catalase positive and oxidase negative. The biochemical characteristics are useful for distinguishing dif ferent Salmonella spp. (Table 32-2). Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: The bacilli are killed at a temperature of 55\u00baC in 1 hour or at 60\u00baC in 15 minutes. They are also killed by 0.2% mercuric chloride or 5% phenol in 5 minutes. Boiling, chlorination of water, and pasteurization of milk kill the bacteria. They survive for weeks in polluted water and soil, and for months in ice. Cultures may be viable for years if prevented from drying. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) The cell wall of salmonellae like any other Gram-negative bacilli contains a complex lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure. The LPS is liberated during lysis of the cell and to some extent during culture. The LPS moiety functions as an endotoxin and is an important component of the virulence of the bacteria. The LPS complex consists of three components: (i) an outer O poly-saccharide coat, (ii) a middle portion (the R core), and (iii) inner lipid A coat. The LPS of salmonellae is important because of the following reasons: Salmonella Typhi Salmonella Paratyphi A Salmonella Paratyphi B Salmonella Paratyphi C Glucose AA G A G A G Mannitol AA G A G A /H11002 and 3:19:22 PMSection III Chapter 32SALMONELLA 271 1. The repeating sugar units in the outer O polysaccharide chain are responsible for O-antigen specif icity. This also helps to determine virulence of the bacteria. Salmonella strains lacking the complete sequence of O sugar repeat units are known as rough strains. They are so called because of rough appearance of the colonies. The rough strains are less virulent or avirulent than the smooth strains, which have a full complement of \"O\" sugar repeat unit. 2. The endotoxin component of the cell wall is important in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections. Endo toxins cause fever, activate the serum complement kinin and clotting systems, and depresses myocardiac functions. The circula-tory endotoxin is also responsible in part for development of septic shock that can occur in systemic infection. 3. Antibodies produced against R core (common enterobacte-rial antigen) are protectiv e against infection caused by wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria due to sharing of common core structure. In some situations, the antibodies against R core mediate the lethal effects of Gram-negative bacteria. Antigenic properties Salmonella possess three major antigens: 1. H or flagellar antigen 2. O or somatic antigen 3. Surface antigens (Vi antigen, M and N antigen, and F antigens) H or flagellar antigen: This antigen is present on the f lagella and is heat and alcohol labile. The antigens are destroyed by boiling or by treatment with alcohols and acid, but they are pre-served in 0.2-0.4% formaldehyde. The H antigens of Salmonella are genus specific and are not shared by other enterobacteria. The antigens are destroyed by boiling or by treatment with alcohols and acid but they are preserved in 0.2-0.4% formaldehyde. The H antigen is strongly immunogenic and is associated with the formation of antibodies following infection or immunization. H antigen may occur in either or both the forms called phase I and phase II. The organisms tend to change from one phase to another. The complete identification of serotype depends on detection of serological structure in both the phases.O or somatic antigen: O antigens occur on the surface of the outer membranes and are determined by specific sugar sequences on the cell surface. O antigen is an LPS complex and is an integral part of the cell wall. It is heat stable, resis-tant to boiling up to 2 hours and 30 minutes. It is also alcohol stable, resistant to treatment with 96% ethanol at 37\u00baC for 4 hours and is also resistant to 0.2% formaldehyde. This antigen can be extracted from cell wall by treatment with trichloroace-tic acid. Treatment with phenol removes the antigenicity but retains the toxicity of the bacteria. Antigen is less immunogenic than H antigen. Generally, the O antibody titer produced after infection or immunization is lower than that of H antibod-ies. The O antigen is not a single factor but a mosaic of two or more antigenic factors. Salmonella are classified based on the presence of characteristic O antigen on the bacterial surface. Till now, 67 \"O\" antigens have been described. On the basis of the somatic antigens, Salmonella has been classified into 46 \"O\" serogroups.Surface antigens: These include (a) Vi antigen, (b) M and N antigens, and (c) F antigens, and are discussed below.Vi antigen: Vi antigen is a surface antigen overlying the \"O\" anti-gen. Felix and Pitt, who first described this antigen, believed that it was related to virulence and gave it the name 'Vi antigen.' It is analogous to the K antigens of coliforms. The antigen is present only in few serotypes, the most important being S. Typhi. This antigen is also present in some strains of Salmonella Paratyphi C, Salmonella Dublin, and Citrobacter freundii. The presence of this antigen on the surface renders these bacteria inagglutinable by their specific O antiserum but agglutinable by Vi antisera. The Vi antigen is heat labile and is destroyed by boiling within 1 hour. Vi antigen is also destroyed by treatment with phenol hydrochloric acid and 0.5 sodium hydroxide, but the antigen remains unaffected by 0.25% formaldehyde or alcohol. The Vi antigen is lost on serial subculture. Key Points Vi antigen Poorly immunogenic and is assocated with production of low titer of antibodies during infection. Antibody disappears early in convalescence. Its persistence indicates development of carrier state. Complete absence of Vi antibody in a proven case of typhoid fever indicates poor prognosis. Phenolized vaccines do not induce Vi antibodies forma-tion in serum, but alcoholized vaccines induce low titer of Vi antibodies. Demonstration of the Vi antibody is not useful for the diagnosis of cases of typhoid; hence, Vi antigen is not tested in Widal test. M and N antigens: These antigens are present on the surface of bacteria and are polysaccharide in nature. These antigens pre-vent agglutination by O antiserum. Boiling for two and half hours destroys these antigens. The presence of M antigen is responsible for mucoid nature of Salmonella colonies.F antigen: These antigens are present on the fimbriae. They occur in two phases: one with F antigen and the other without F antigen. Antigenic variation Salmonellae antigens undergo phenotypic variation 2. V-W variation 3. S-R variation 4. Phase variation 5. Variations in O antigens OH-O variation: Flagellated salmonellae (OH) some times give rise to nonflagellated (O) strains. This variation known as Chap-32.indd 271 5/14/2012 3:19:22 PMSection III Chapter 32272 BACTERIOLOGY OH-O is associated with the loss of flagella. When salmonellae are grown on agar containing phenol (1:800), fla-gella are not formed. This change is phenotypic and temporary because flagella reappear when the strain is subcultured on media without phenol. The loss of flagella is usually not total but there is only a decrease in the number of flagella and the quantity of the H antigen. Flagellated bacteria are also found in small numbers in such cultures. Subculture in Craigie's tube (Fig. 32-1) is used to obtain a population of flagellated bacteria from such cultures. In Craigie's tube method (Fig. 32-2), a wide tube containing semisolid agar (0.2%) is used. A short, narrow tube, open at both ends, is placed into the agar of the tube in such a way that the upper end of the tube projects well above the agar. The bacterial strain is inoculated into the inner tube, and after 8-16 hours of incubation, subcultures made from top of the agar outside the central tube yield a population of motile cells. A U-tube of soft agar instead of Craigie's tube may be used for the purpose, in which inoculation is made into one limb and subculture is taken from the other. Rarely, salmonellae may lose their flagella by mutation. S. Typhi 901-O strain is an example of a stable nonmotile mutant, which is used for the preparation of O-agglutinable bacterial antigen suspensions for use in Widal test and other serological tests.V-W variation: Almost all freshly isolated strains of S. Typhi carry a surface layer of Vi antigen that completely masks the O antigen. When fully expressed, such bacilli are agglutinable with Vi antiserum but not with the O antiserum. This is called the V form. After a number of subcultures, the Vi antigen is completely lost. Such cultures are inagglutinable with the Vi antiserum but readily agglutinable with the O antiserum. This is called the W form. With partial loss of the Vi antigen, the bacillus is agglutinable with both Vi and O antisera; such forms are called \"VW forms\". Vi antigens, however, do not completely mask the O antigen in S. Paratyphi C and S. Dublin.S-R variation: The smooth-to-rough (S-R) variation occurs due to mutation and is associated with the (i) change in the colony morphology from smooth to rough, (ii) loss of the O antigen, and (iii) loss of virulence. The rough colonies become large, rough, and irregular and are autoagglutinable in saline. These colonies show a defective capacity to synthesize O anti-gen. Conversion into rough forms occurs rarely in nature but is common in laboratory strains maintained by serial subcul-ture on ordinary media. The smooth S-R variation may be pre-vented to some extent by maintaining cultures on Dorset's egg media or by lyophilization.Phase variation: The flagellar or H antigens of most salmonel- lae occur in two alternate phases: phase 1 and phase 2. Phase 1 antigens are either specific for a serotype or shared by a few spe-cies only, hence known as the \"specific\" or species phase. A large number of flagellar antigens, more than 80, have been found in this phase. These are designated as small letters of alphabets a-z except j and subsequently z1-z68. The presumptive identi-fication of serotype is based on the identification of the antigen in phase 1. Phase 2 antigens are widely shared, hence known as the \"nonspecific\" or \"group\" phase. Phase 2 antigens are far fewer and are designated by Arabic numerals from 1 to 12 (1, 2, and 3 . . . up to 12). Salmonella strains that occur in both phases are called bipha- sic, while the strains that occur in one phase only are called monophasic (e.g., S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A, etc.). A culture contains cells with the flagellar or H antigens of both phases but generally one or the other phase predominates so that the culture is agglutinated only by one of the phase anti-sera. For definite identification of Salmonella isolates by sero-typing, it is necessary to identify the H antigens of both phases. Conversion of isolates from one phase to another is achieved by using Craigie's tube method. In this method, a culture in phase 1 is converted to phase 2 by passing it through the Craigie's tube containing specific phase 1 antiserum, and the reverse conversion is achieved by using phase 2 antiserum.

Chap-32.indd 272 5/14/2012 3:19:22 PMSection III Chapter 32SALMONELLA 273 Variations in O antigen: Changes in the structural formulae of the O antigen may be brought about by lysogenization with some converting phages, resulting in the alteration of bacterial serotypes. Thus, Salmonella Anatum (serotype 3,10:e,h:1,6) is (serotype 3,15:e,h: 1,6) by one phage and the Minneapolis (serotype 3,15,34:e,h:1,6) by phage 34. Serotypes Newington and Minneapolis 15/H11001 and anatum var. 15/H11001, 34/H11001, respectively. Pathogenesis and Immunity S. Typhi is an invasive bacterium. It colonizes the human intes- tine and, under specific conditions, directly invades the intestinal mucosa or multiplies for several days within the mononuclear phagocytic cells in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer patches of the ileum before invasion. The bacteria subsequently enter the blood stream and cause the disease manifestations. Virulence factors Virulence factors of salmonellae are complex (Table 32-3). These are encoded both on the organism's chromosome and on large (34-120 kDa) plasmids.Type III secretion systems: Type III secretion systems (TTSS) consist of nearly 20 proteins, which facilitate secretion of viru-lence factors of Salmonella into host cells. These are encoded by several Salmonella pathogenicity islands, such as Salmonella pathogenicity-island 1 (SPI-1) and Salmonella pathogenicity-island 2 (SPI-2), phoP/phoQ. Absence of these pathogenicity islands renders the organism avirulent. TTSS mediate uptake of the bacteria into epithelial cells. SPI-1 mediates nonphago-cytic cell invasion and SPI-2 facilitates survival and replication of Salmonella within macrophages.Endotoxin: Endotoxin is responsible for many of the systemic manifestations of the disease caused by Salmonella spp.Fimbriae: The species-specific fimbriae mediate binding of Salmonella to M (microfold) cells present in Peyer patches of the terminal part of the small intestine. These M cells typically transport foreign antigens, such as bacteria to the underlying macrophages for clearance.Acid tolerance response gene: The acid tolerance response (ATR) gene protects Salmonella spp. from stomach acids and the acidic pH of the phagosome, thereby facilitating survival of bacteria in phagosomes by an ATR gene.Enzymes: Catalase and superoxide dismutase are the enzymes that protect the bacteria from intracellular killing in macrophages. Pathogenesis of enteric fever The severity of disease in individuals infected with salmonellae is dependent on the virulence factors of the infecting strain as well as on the human host. Infective dose: The infection is acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated with salmonellae (Fig. 32-3). The infec-tive dose (ID 50) in human volunteer experiments has been found to be about 103-106 bacilli. Although the infectious dose varies among strains, a large inoculum is necessary to overcome stomach acidity and to compete with normal intestinal flora. Large inocula are also associated with higher rates of illness and shorter incubation periods. However, lower infectious doses may be adequate to cause infection if: these organisms are coingested with foods that rapidly transit the stomach (e.g., liquids) or that increase gastric pH (e.g., cheese, milk); antacids are used concomitantly; or these bacteria are ingested by individuals with defective immune systems. On reaching the intestine, the salmonellae attach themselves by fimbriae or pili to cells lining the ileal mucosa. The bacteria selectively attach to specialized epithelial cells (M cells) of the Peyer patches. Salmonella TTSS mediate the initial invasion of S. Typhi into the intestinal mucosa. SPI-1 introduces Salmonella- secreted invasion proteins (Sips or Ssps) into the M cells result-ing in membrane ruffling. The ruffled membranes surround and swallow salmonellae, leading to intracellular replication in the phagosome with subsequent death of host cells and spread to adjacent epithelial cells and lymphoid tissue. An ATR gene also protects Salmonella spp. from stomach acids and the acidic pH of the phagosome. Catalase and superoxide dismutase are other factors that protect the bacteria from intracellular kill-ing. The bacteria are then transported within phagosomes to the lamina propria, where they are released. In the lamina pro-pria, typhoidal strains of salmonellae induce production of macrophages, while nontyphoidal strains induce production of neutrophils (nontyphoidal strains). Subsequently, S. Typhi and other virulent Salmonella strains invade deeper tissues via lymphatics and capillaries and elicit a major immune response. The organisms travel from the submucosa to the mesenteric lymph nodes, multiply, and then enter the blood stream via the thoracic duct (transient primary bacteremia) to spread to other tissues. Virulence factors Biological functions Endotoxin Causes many systemic manifestations of salmonellosis Type III secretion systemsMediate secretion of virulence factors of Salmonella into host cells Fimbriae Mediate binding of Salmonella to M (microfold) cells present in Peyer patches of the terminal part of the small intestine Acid tolerance response (ATR) geneProtects Salmonella spp. from stomach acids and the acid pH of the phagosome Catalase Protects the bacteria from intracellular killing in macrophages Superoxide dismutase Protects the bacteria from intracellular killing in factors of III Chapter 32274 BACTERIOLOGY During this bacteremic phase, the bacteria may invade any organ but most commonly are found in reticuloendothelial tissues of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, gallbladder, and Peyer patches in the terminal ileum. The gallbladder is infected via the liver, and the resultant cholecystitis usually is subclinical. The infected bile renders positive. Preexisting gallbladder disease predisposes to chronic biliary infection, leading to long-term fecal carriage. Invasion of Peyer patches occurs during either the primary intestinal infection or secondary bacteremia, and further spread of bacteria occurs through infected bile. The Peyer patches become hyperplastic with infiltration of chronically inflamed cells, which may lead to necrosis of the superficial layer and ulcer formation, with potential hemorrhage from blood vessel erosion or peritonitis from transmural perforation. The pathogenesis of the prolonged fever and toxemia of the enteric fever is not well-understood. Pyrogens and mediators produced at the sites of inflammation have been suggested as factors responsible for the prolonged fever. Host immunity Salmonella spp. are primarily intracellular pathogens, hence cell-mediated immunity (CMI) rather than humoral antibodies play more important role in protection against the disease. CMI devel-ops during the course of the disease and appears to be common in populations in areas endemic for typhoid fever. Individuals with depressed CMI appear to be more susceptible to S. Typhi infec- tions. In acute infection, O antibody appears first, rising progres-sively, later falling, and often disappearing within a few months; H antibody appears slightly later but persists longer. Rising or high O antibody titers generally indicate acute infection, whereas ele-vated levels of H antibody help to identify the type of enteric fever. Clinical Syndromes S. Typhi causes typhoid fever, while S. Paratyphi A, Salmonella Schottmuelleri (formerly S. Paratyphi B), and Salmonella Hirschfeldii (formerly S. Paratyphi C) cause a mild form of this disease referred to as paratyphoid fever. The term enteric fever includes both typhoid and paratyphoid fever caused by these Salmonella spp. Enteric fever Enteric fever is generally an acute illness manifested by fever, headache, and abdominal symptoms. The incubation period is usually from 7 to 14 days, but may range from 3 to 56 days. Onset of the disease is usually gradual, with headache, mal- aise, anorexia, a coated tongue, and abdominal discomfort with either constipation or diarrhea. A step-ladder pyrexia with rela-tive bradycardia and toxemia is the typical feature. The condi-tion is associated with a soft, palpable spleen and an enlarged liver. These symptoms are present for a week or more and are followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. This phase corresponds to an initial bacteremic phase, which is followed by coloniza-tion of gallbladder and then reinfection of the intestines. Intestinal perforation, severe hemorrhage, and circulatory collapse are most important complications. Toxic encephalop-athy, cerebral thrombosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, arthritis, and myocarditis are other complications. Convalescence is slow. Relapse is common after initial recovery in 10-20% of patients treated with antibiotics. A relapse typically occurs approximately 1 week after the therapy is discontinued, but relapse even after 2 months has been reported. A relapse gener-ally is milder and shorter than the initial disease. Rarely, second or even third relapses may occur. The blood culture and serum H, O, and Vi antibodies are again positive in cases of relapse. Paratyphoid fever caused by S. Paratyphi A and B resembles typhoid fever but is generally milder. S. Paratyphi C may also cause paratyphoid fever, but more often it leads to a frank septicemia with suppurative complications. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Enteric fever is endemic in many developing countries of the world and is primarily found in those countries of the develop-ing world where sanitary conditions are poor.

Pathogenesis of Chapter 32SALMONELLA 275 Typhoid fevers are endemic in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast and Far East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Central America, and South America. Approximately, 12-13 million cases of typhoid fever occur globally each year with 600,000 deaths. Enteric fever is endemic in all parts of India. Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in the developed countries due to improvements in water supply and sanitation during last many decades. Paratyphoid fever still continues to be health problem in both developing and developed countries. S. Paratyphi A is prevalent in India and other Asian countries, Eastern Europe, and South America; S. Paratyphi B in North America, Britain, and Western Europe; and S. Paratyphi C in Eastern Europe and Guyana. Habitat S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi (A, B, and C) are strict human patho- gens. They are not found in any other animal hosts. They colonize the small intestine, especially ileac mucosa in infected human hosts. Asymptomatic long-term colonization occurs commonly in infected hosts. Other salmonellae are parasitic in various domestic animals, rodents, reptiles, and birds. S. Typhimurium have a wide host range affecting animals, birds, and humans, while Salmonella Abortus-equi is found only in horses, Salmonella Abortus-oris in sheep, and S.Gallinarum in poultry. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection The infected patient and, more frequently, carriers are impor-tant reservoirs of infection for enteric fever. Key Points Convalescent carriers: Patients who continue to excrete typhoid bacilli in feces for 3 weeks to 3 months after clinical cure. Temporary carriers: Those who shed the bacilli for /H11022 3 months but /H11021 1 year. Chronic carriers: Those who excrete the bacilli for /H11022 1 year are called. About 2-4% of patients become chronic carriers. The bacilli persist in the gallbladder and are excreted in feces (fecal carrier) or persist in the kidney and are secreted in the urine (urinary carrier). Urinary carriers are less frequent than the fecal carriers and usually present with some urinary lesion, such as calculus or schistosomiasis. The carrier state is more common in women than in men and in the older people (over 40 years) than in young people. Food handlers or cooks who become carriers are potentially dangerous to the community. Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), a New York cook was a classical case of such carrier who, over a period of 15 years, caused at least seven outbreaks affecting more than 200 persons. Carrier stage also occurs with S. Paratyphi infections. S. Paratyphi A infection occurs only in humans, while S. Paratyphi B infection occurs in animals, such as dogs or cows.Food, vegetables, and water contaminated with human feces infected by S. Typhi are the common sources of infection. S. Typhi infections occur when food or water contaminated by infected food handlers or due to poor personal hygiene is ingested. The infectious dose for S. Typhi infections is low, so person- to-person spread is common. The infectious dose is still lower for people at high risk for disease because of age, immunosuppression, or underlying disease (leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell disease), or reduced gastric acidity. There is no animal reservoir for typhoidal salmonellae. Animal-to-human zoonotic transmission is common in only nonty-phoidal salmonellae. Poultry, livestock, reptiles, and pets are the principal reservoirs for nontyphoidal Salmonella organisms. Ingestion of improperly cooked fruits, vegetables, foods of ani-mal origin, including poultry, red meats, unpasteurized milk, and eggs that have been contaminated by infected animals or an infected human is the mode of transmission. Contact with infected reptiles, such as iguanas, pet turtles, and tor-toises, and ingestion of contaminated water are other modes of transmission. Classification and typing of Salmonella 1. Kauffmann-White scheme: Kauf fmann-White scheme is a method of classification of Salmonella strains based on structural formulae of the O and H antigens of the strains, which are identified by agglutination with specific anti-sera. Salmonellae are classified into different O serogroups, based on the presence of distinctive O antigen factors. Each serogroup contains a number of serotypes possessing a common O factor not found in other serogroups. These O factors are now designated 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.; these were originally designated by capital letters A-Z and afterward by numbers 51-67. Some serogroups were subdivided into subserogroups (e.g., C1-C4; E1-E4). It seems logical to name each serogroup by its characteristic O antigen factor numbers, rather than by letters. Hence, it is now being pro-posed to designate group A as 2, B as 4, C1 as 7, C2 as 8, D as 9, and so on. Within each O serogroup, the different serotypes are identified by the presence of phase 1 and phase 2 of flagellar antigens. The antigenic structure of a Salmonella serotype is designated by an antigenic formula, which has three components describing the O antigens, the phase 1 H antigen, and phase 2 H antigen in that order. Three parts are separated by colons and the component antigens in each part by commas. The Kauffmann-White scheme designates each serotype as a species (Table 32-4). Currently, more than 2400 sero-types have been described by Kauffmann-White scheme. 2. Bacteriophage typing: Bacteriophage typing is the intra- species classification of S. Typhi, first developed by Craigie and Yen (1937). They observed that bacteriophage acting Chap-32.indd 275 5/14/2012 3:19:23 PMSection III Chapter 32276 on the Vi antigen of S. Typhi (Vi phage II) is highly adapt- able. The parent phage is known as phage A. It could be made specific for a particular strain of S. Typhi by serial propagation in the strain. Such adaptation was obtained by phenotypic or genotypic variation. The phage typing is carried out by determining the sensitivity of the cultures to a series of variants of Vi phase. However, most other types are sensitive to only one or a few related adaptions. As phage typing of S. Typhi depends on the presence of Vi antigens, a proportion of strains (Vi negative) will be untypable. At present, 97 Vi II phage types of S. Typhi are recognized. S. Typhi phage types E1, O, and A are most common in India. To make phage typing more useful and more discrimi- native, additional markers have been used for the subdivi-sion of strains belonging to a phage type. These include (a) Nicolle's complementary phage typing, ( b) Kristensen's biotyping, (c) production tetrathionate (d) production of bacteriocin, and (e) antibiogram. The phage typing is useful in (i) tracing the source of epidemics and (ii) providing information on the trends and patterns of typhoid epidemiology at the local, national, and interna-tional levels. Phage typing schemes have also been applied to S. Paratyphi A and B, S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, S. Dublin, and other serotypes. Phage typing in India is car- ried out at the National Phage Typing Centres located at the Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi. 3. Biotyping: Bio typing is a useful method to classify differ- ent Salmonella strains of a particular serotype into a num- ber of biotypes by their biochemical characteristics. On the basis of 15 different biochemical characteristics, Duguid et al. in 1975 differentiated S. Typhimurium into 144 different biotypes. The same biochemical characteris-tics have also been used to biotype S. Paratyphi B, Salmonella Montevideo, and S. Agona. S. Typhi has been differenti- ated into different biotypes on the basis of fermentation of arabinose, dulcitol, and xylose.Biotyping is useful to supplement phage typing because it subdivides further a large number of untypable strains or members of common phage types. Conversely, strains of the same biotype may be reorganized into different phage types. Therefore, a combination of phage typing and biotyping provides a better discrimination of Salmonella strains than either method used alone. 4. Molecular methods: Currently and random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis have been employed as more discriminating methods for epidemiological characterization of Salmonella in advanced centers. The National Salmonella Reference Centre in India is located at the Central Research Institute, Kasauli (Himachal Pradesh). The reference center for salmonel-lae of animal origin is at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar (UP). Theses reference centers provide services for identification of unusual serotypes and recon-firmation of other serotypes of salmonellae. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of enteric fever is based on the following methods: 1. Isolation of Salmonella spp. by culture, 2. Serodiagnosis by demonstration Salmonella antibodies and antigens, and 3. Molecular diagnosis by DNA probes and PCR. Specimens Blood, blood clot, bone marrow, and stool are common speci-mens used for isolation of typhoidal bacilli for culture. Other specimens include the cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, mesenteric lymph nodes, resected intestine, pharynx, abscess, bone, and O serogroup Serotype O antigens (and Vi) H antigens New Old Phase 1 Phase 2 2A Salmonella Paratyphi A 1,2,12 a \u2014 III Chapter 32SALMONELLA 277 Culture Blood culture: Blood culture is a very useful procedure for diagnosis of enteric fever. It is positive in approximately 90% of cases in the first week of fever, 75% of cases in the second week, 60% in the third week, and 25% thereafter till the subsidence of pyrexia. Blood cultures, however, rapidly become negative on treatment with antibiotics. In this method, approximately 5-10 mL of blood is collected aseptically by venepuncture and inoculated into a culture bottle containing 50-100 mL of 0.5% bile broth. This 10-fold dilution of blood is achieved by adding 5-10 mL of blood to 50-100 mL of bile broth which is carried out to neutralize the bactericidal action of many substances that are present in the blood. The addition of liquid (sodium polyanethol sulfonate) further coun-teracts the bactericidal action of blood. Blood culture bottle is incubated at 37\u00baC for up to 7 days. After incubation overnight at 37\u00baC, the bile broth is subcultured on Mac Conkey agar. Blood culture is positive in approximately 90% of cases in the first week of fever, 75% of cases in the 2nd week, 60% in the 3rd week, and 25% thereafter till the subsidence of pyrexia. Blood cultures, however, rapidly become negative on treatment with antibiotics.Casta\u00f1eda's biphasic method of blood culture: It is a better method of culture to reduce the risk of contamination during repeated subcultures. The method has additional advantage of being more safe and economical. In this method, the culture bottle has an agar slant in one side, which is flooded with bile broth. After inoculation of blood, the bottle is incubated in the upright position so that surface of the agar remains free without any broth covering the slant. Broth remains only in the lower part of the agar slope. For subculture, the bottle is simply tilted so that the broth flows over the surface of the agar slant and is reincubated in the upright position. If salmonellae are present, colonies appear on the agar slant (Color Photo 34).Clot culture: Clot culture is a more sensitive method than the blood culture, because certain inhibitory substances that are found in the serum are absent in the clot proper. Another advantage of this method is that serum eluted from the blood during process of clotting can be used for demonstration of Salmonella antigens or antibodies. In this method, 5 mL of blood is collected under strict aseptic conditions, from the patient, into a sterile test tube and allowed to clot. The serum is pipetted off and used for serological tests. The clot is broken up with a sterile glass rod and added to a bottle of bile broth containing streptokinase (100 units/mL). Streptokinase facilitates lysis of the clot with release of bacteria trapped inside the clot. The bile broth is incubated and subcul-tured on media in the same way as described for blood culture earlier.Bone marrow culture: Bone marrow culture is a most sensitive method. It is positive in most cases even when blood cultures are negative. It is also positive even if patients have been taking antibiotics for several days, regardless of how long they have been suffering from enteric fever. This test is recommended for patients whose initial blood culture results are negative, pos-sibly due to prior antibiotic therapy.Feces culture: Feces culture is also useful because salmonellae are excreted in feces throughout the disease and even during convalescence with varying frequency. The feces is collected from the patient in a sterile container and sent immediately to the laboratory. If delay is anticipated, the stool specimens may be collected in a buffered glycerol saline transport medium. The fecal samples are inoculated directly on MacConkey, DCA, and Wilson-Blair media. Relatively, a heavy inoculation of stool is made on the Wilson-Blair media because it is highly selective. For enrichment, one tube each of selenite and tetrathionate broth is inoculated and incubated at for 12-18 hours before subculture onto selective media. The plates are incubated at 37\u00baC overnight. S. Typhi produces large black colonies, with a metallic sheen on the Wilson-Blair medium. On this medium, S. Paratyphi A produces green colonies due to the absence of H 2S production. Salmonellae form pale nonlactose fermenting colonies on MacConkey and DCA media. The colonies are iden-tified by tests as mentioned earlier (Box 32-1). If no growth is observed after 7 days, then the culture is declared negative.Other specimens for culture: Salmonellae may be isolated from several specimens by culture, but they are not usually employed. These specimens include urine, bile, rose spots, pus from suppurative lesions, CSF, and sputum. Cultures may be obtained from the gallbladder, liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes at autopsy. Isolation of the organism from blood, blood clot, or bone marrow is definitive for diagnosis of enteric fever. Fecal cultures are useful, but a positive fecal culture may occur in carriers as well as in patients. Bile culture is useful for detection of carriers. Identification of bacteria Colonies are identified by carrying out motility test, biochemical tests, and slide agglutination with specific Salmonella antisera (Box 32-1). Slide agglutination test: The test is performed with a loopful of growth from nutrient agar plate or slope emulsified in two drops of saline on a clean slide. If S. Typhi is suspected, that is, when no gas is formed from glucose, a loopful of typhoid O antiserum (factor 9/group D) is added to one drop of bacterial emulsion on the slide. The slide is rocked gently. Development 1. Produces non-lactose-fermenting pale colonies on MacConkey agar. 2. Produces jet black colonies surrounded by a metallic sheen on Wilson and Blair's bismuth sulf maltose, forming acid only , but no gas. 4. Do no t decarboxylate ornithine. 5. Catalase positive and oxidase negative. 6. Motile. 7. H2S positive, catalase positive, indole negative, and oxidase negative. 8. Agglutination with typhoid O antiserum (factor 9/group D) is positiv III Chapter 32278 BACTERIOLOGY of immediate agglutination suggests that Salmonella strain tested belongs to Salmonella group D. Identity of S. Typhi is established by agglutination with the flagellar antiserum (anti-d serum). Sometimes, fresh isolates of S. Typhi occur in the V form and do not agglutinate with the O antiserum. Such strains may be tested for agglutination against anti-Vi serum. Alternatively, the growth scraped off in a small amount of saline is tested for agglutination with the O antiserum after boiling for 20 minutes. If the isolate is a non-typhoidal Salmonella, producing gas from sugars, it is tested for agglutination with O and H antisera for groups A, B, C, etc. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis of enteric fever is based on detection of specific Salmonella antibodies in the serum, or antigen in the serum and also in urine by various serological tests. Demonstration of serum antibodies Widal test: Widal test is the traditional serologic test used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. The test measures agglutinating antibodies against flagellar (H) and somatic (O) antigens of and paratyphoid in the patient's sera. This is a tube agglutination test in which Dreyer's narrow agglutination tube with a conical bottom is used for H agglutination, and Felix's short round bottomed tube for O agglutination. The H and O antigens of S. Typhi and the H antigens of S. Paratyphi A and B are used in the test. The paratyphi O antigens are not used because they cross-react with the typhoid O antigen due to their sharing of antigenic factor 12. H antigens of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A and B are used individually because H antigens of these bacteria do not show any cross-reactivity with each other. S. Typhi 901, 'O' and 'H' strains are used for preparation of antigen. The O antigen is prepared by culture of S. Typhi on phe- nol agar (1:800) and harvesting the growth in a small volume of saline. The saline bacterial suspension is then mixed with 20 times its volume of absolute alcohol, heated at 40-50\u00baC for 30 minutes, centrifuged, and the deposit is resuspended in saline to the appropriate density. Chloroform is used as a preservative. It is always essential to use standard smooth strains obtained from reference centers for antigen prepara-tion. After preparation of antigen, each batch of antigen is always compared with a standard. The H antigens are prepared by adding 0.1% formalin to a 24-hour broth culture or saline suspension of an agar culture. The test is performed by taking equal volumes (0.4 mL) of serial dilutions of the serum (from 1/20 to 1/640) and H antigen of S. Typhi (TH), S. Paratyphi A (AH), S. Paratyphi B (BH) and O antigens of S. Typhi (TO) and mixing in Dreyer's tubes and Felix's tubes, respectively. The tubes are then incubated in a water bath at 37\u00baC overnight. Some recommend incuba-tion at 37\u00baC for 4 hours, followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00baC. Control tubes containing the antigen and normal saline are used to check for autoagglutination. The agglutination titers of the serum are read. H agglutination is characterized by the formation of loose, cotton woolly clumps, while O agglutination by a disc-like pattern at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant fluid remains clear in both types of agglutina-tions. The highest dilution of the serum showing agglutination with H or O antigens suggests the antibody titer of the patient's serum. The results of the Widal test should be interpreted, tak-ing into account the following: 1. Antibodies against H and O antigens usually appear by 7th-10th day of the illness and increase steadily till the third or the f ourth week, after which it declines gradually. Hence, the blood collected before 7-10 days will be nega-tive for antibodies. 2. Demonstration of a fourfold or more rise in titer of antibod-ies in a paired sample, one sam ple collected in the first week and second sample is collected in the third week, is more useful than demonstration of antibodies in a single serum. 3. A titer of 1/100 or more for O antibodies and 1/200 or more for H antibodies is usually suggestiv e of enteric fever. However, the results of a single test should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, it is necessary to obtain basal anti-body titer levels in \"normal sera\" in different areas, before arriving at a cut off diagnostic titer for H and O antibodies. 4. An elevated level of antibodies may be present in sera of patients suff ering from enteric fever in past and in sera of individuals with inapparent infection or vaccination against the enteric fever. Therefore, the mere demonstra-tion of antibodies in the Widal test should need not be considered to be suggestive of the enteric fever. 5. Serum from an individual vaccinated with TAB vac-cine may sho w high titers of antibodies to S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A and B. However, in case of infection, high titers of antibodies will be seen only against the infecting species. H antibodies persist for many months after vaccina-tion, but O antibodies disappear earlier within 6 months. However, in case of infection, high titres of antibodies will be seen only against the infecting species. 6. Individuals who had suffered from enteric infections in past or who hav e been immunized may develop an anamnestic response during an unrelated fever, such as malaria, inf luenza, etc. The anamnestic response shows only a transient rise of antibodies, while the antibody rise is sustained in enteric fever. 7. Patients treated early with antibiotics, such as chloram-phenicol, may sho w a poor antibody response. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the Widal test have been shown to vary dramatically among laboratories. This wide variation is caused by differences in antigens, tech-niques, and patient population. The Widal test is positive in enteric fever in only 40-60% of patients at the time admission.Other serological tests: Indirect hemagglutination, assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to S. Typhi polysaccharide are available for diagnosis of typhoid fever with varying sensitivity and specificity. Monoclonal antibodies against S. Typhi flagellin have been evaluated to increase specificity of the ELISA for antibodies. Chap-32.indd 278 5/14/2012 3:19:23 PMSection III Chapter 32SALMONELLA 279 serum antigens In typhoid fever, circulating S. Typhi antigen is present in the serum as well as in the urine, but absent in serum of a cured case of typhoid. Hence, demonstration of serum antigen always indicates an active or recent typhoid fever. Counter-current immunoelectrophoresis, co-agglutination test, and ELISA are frequently employed for detection of circulating antigen in the serum and also in urine for diagnosis of typhoid fever with varying sensitivity and specificity. Molecular Diagnosis Currently, DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are being increasingly evaluated for the diagnosis of typhoid fever. DNA probes, although not commercially available, have been developed for identifying S. Typhi from bacterial culture isolates and directly from blood. PCR is still in experimental stage. Treatment Chloramphenicol was the antibiotic of choice for treatment of enteric fever since its introduction in 1948. It acts by bind-ing to 50S bacterial-ribosomal subunits and inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis. Because of low cost, for sensitive S. Typhi strains, chloramphenicol is still used to treat typhoid fever. Key Points Chloramphenicol-resistant S. Typhi Chloramphenicol-resistant S. Typhi causing an epidemic with high mortality appeared in Mexico in 1972, spread-ing to North America and Europe. In India the epidemics of multidrug-resistant S. Typhi first appeared in Calicut (Kerala) in 1972. It became endemic and was confined to Kerala till 1978. Subsequently such resistant strains appeared in many other parts of India. These resistant strains were also resistant to streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline; it was due to a transmissible plasmid carrying resistant determinants to these antibiotics. These resistant strains were initially sensitive to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, and furazolidone, which were used for treatment. By late 1980s, S. Typhi strains resistant to many or all of these drugs began to appear from many parts of India. At present, the fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, pefloxa- ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) are the antibiotics of choice for treatment of multidrug-resistant S. Typhi. They are increas- ingly used for typhoid fever because of their efficacy and low relapse and low carrier rates associated with their use. Cefotaxime prevents bacterial cell wall synthesis, which inhibits bacterial growth. The antibiotic shows excellent in vitro activity against S. Typhi and other salmonellae, and has acceptable efficacy in typhoid fever. Recently, emergence of domestically acquired ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella infections has been described. The cost and need for intravenous administration are the noted disadvantages of third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in developing countries. A 14-day course of chloramphenicol, ampicillin, or trime- thoprim and sulfamethoxazole is indicated for S. Typhi infection. Prevention and Control Availability of safe drinking water, proper food hygiene, and sanitary disposal of excreta are the most cost-effective strate-gies for reducing the incidence of typhoid fever in endemic countries. These measures not only reduce the incidence of typhoid fever but also reduce other enteric infections, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in those areas. Immunization Immunization with typhoid vaccines at regular intervals also considerably reduces the incidence of typhoidal Salmonella infections. Routine typhoid vaccination is indicated for (i) persons with intimate exposure (e.g., household contact) to S. Typhi cases or carrier; (ii) travelers to countries associated with an increased risk of exposure to S. Typhi; and (iii) micro- biology laboratory personnel working with S. Typhi. The fol- lowing two types of typhoid vaccines, killed and oral, are used: Killed vaccines TAB vaccine: The TAB vaccine is a killed whole cell vaccine that contains heat-killed and 0.5% phenol-preserved S. Typhi, 1000 million/mL, and S. Paratyphi A and B, 750 million each per mL. The vaccine has been used for many years in India and in other countries, endemic for enteric fever. The vaccine is given subcutaneously in two doses of 0.5 mL each at an interval of 4-6 weeks, followed by a booster dose every 3 years. Field trials have shown overall efficacy of 70-90% in typhoid fever for a period of 3-7 years. Fever and pain at the site of injection are the side effects. Injection of a large volume of antigen is also another concern. Therefore, in India, divalent typhoid-paratyphoid A vaccine without S. Paratyphi B is used instead of the trivalent TAB vaccine, because S. Paratyphi B infection is not that common in the country.Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen vaccine (ViCPS): The ViCPS antigen vaccine is composed of purified Vi antigen, the capsular polysaccharide produced by S. Typhi isolated from blood cultures. Primary vaccination with ViCPS is carried out by a single parenteral dose of 0.5 mL (25 /H9262g IM). Booster doses are needed every 2 years to maintain protection, if continued or renewed exposure to S. Typhi is expected. Two field trials showed overall protection rates of 50-64% in South Africa and 72% in Nepal, the areas endemic for the disease. Fever, headache, erythema, and induration are some of the side effects. The vaccine is not recommended for children below 2 years.Acetone-inactivated parenteral vaccine: This vaccine is currently available only in the United States only for military use. The vaccine has shown an efficacy of 75-94%. Booster doses are given every 3 years, if continued or renewed exposure is expected. Chap-32.indd 279 5/14/2012 3:19:23 PMSection III Chapter 32280 BACTERIOLOGY A 35-year-old adult was admitted to hospital with high fever (/H11022101\u00baF), headache, and abdominal symptoms for last 10 days. He gave a history of abdominal discomfort with diarrhea. A local doctor had examined the patient 4 days back and had given a course of chloroquine for treatment of malaria, but the patient did not show any sign of improvement. A battery of tests was carried out to rule out typhoid fever. Describe the virulence factors of the bacteria responsible for typhoid fever. Describe the laboratory tests employed for diagnosis of typhoid fever. What are the vaccines available against the typhoid fever? Does the bacteria causing typhoid fever show any resistance to antibiotics? Discuss about that.CASE STUDYVaccine Oral vaccinesTy21a oral vaccine: This is an oral vaccine containing live attenuated S. Typhi Ty21a strains in an enteric-coated capsule. S. Typhi Ty21a strain is a stable mutant lacking the enzyme UDP- galactose-4-epimerase. On ingestion, the strain initiates infection, but after four or five cell divisions causes self-destruction, hence lacks the capability to cause any illness. Although the mechanism is unknown, the vaccine appears to stimulate both serum and intestinal antibodies and cell- mediated immune responses. Primary vaccination with Ty21a consists of one enteric- coated capsule, taken on alternate days, with a total of four capsules. Booster doses are needed every 5 years to maintain protection if continued or renewed exposure is expected. It is essential to store the capsules in a refrigerator at 4\u00baC and to take all four doses to achieve maximum efficacy. Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, and rash or urticaria are rare but observed side effects follow-ing vaccination. A significant decrease in the incidence of typhoid fever occurred among persons receiving four doses of vaccine compared to those receiving two doses (P < 0.001) or three doses (P = 0.002) in a field trial, carried out in Chile. However, an efficacy rate of only 42% was recorded in Indonesia, suggesting that the vaccine may not be effective in areas where exposure to S . Typhi is intense. The vaccine is not recommended for immunocompromised persons, including those known to be infected with HIV and for children below 6 years. Salmonella Gastroenteritis Salmonella gastroenteritis is the most common form of salmonellosis. Salmonella gastroenteritis or food poisoning is generally a zoonotic disease, caused by certain species of non-typhoidal salmonellae, which are primarily animal pathogens. S. Typhimurium is the most common species causing the dis- ease in many parts of the world. Some other common species include S. Enteritidis, Salmonella Hadar, Salmonella Heidelberg, S. Agona, Salmonella Virchow, Salmonella Seftenberg, Salmonella Indiana, Salmonella Newport, and S. Anatum. Human infection usually occurs by consumption of contami- nated foods. The most common sources of salmonellae are milk and milk products, meat, poultry, and eggs. Of great concern are eggs and egg products. Salmonellae can enter through the shell if eggs are left on contaminated chicken feed or feces and grow inside. Droppings of rats, lizards, or other small animals may also cause food contamination. Improperly prepared fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and shellfish may cause infection if contaminated through manure or by unhygienic handling. The incubation period is 6-72 hours. Nausea, vomiting, and loose watery stools are the common symptoms. Fever, abdominal cramps, myalgias, and headache are also common. Fever, which rarely exceeds 39\u00baC, occurs in approximately one-half of infected patients. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously in 2-7 days. Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolating the salmonellae from the feces by culture. In outbreaks of food poisoning, iso-lation of salmonellae from the food confirms the diagnosis. Treatment of uncomplicated, noninvasive salmonellosis is symptomatic. Antimicrobial therapy is not indicated because it does not shorten the duration of illness. But for the serious invasive cases, antibiotic treatment is recommended. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended for: Salmonella gastroenteritis in infants below 3 months and in infants below 12 months with high fever and unknown blood culture results; and patients with hemoglobinopathies, HIV infection or other causes of immunosuppression, neoplasms, or chronic GI illnesses. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefotax-ime, and ceftriaxone are effective for the treatment of the condition. Prevention of food contamination at various levels, from nat- ural infection in the animal or bird, is important for prevention of Salmonella gastroenteritis. Proper cooking of food is useful to destroy salmonellae contaminating the food preparations. Salmonella Bacteremia All Salmonella spp. can cause bacteremia. However, S. Choleraesuis, S. Paratyphi, and S. Typhi more commonly cause a bacteremic dis- ease. Pediatric and geriatric patients as well as patients with AIDS are increasingly susceptible to suffer from Salmonella bacteremia. The clinical presentations of Salmonella bacteremia are like that of other Gram-negative bacteremias. However, localized suppurative infections, such as osteomyelitis, deep abscesses, endocarditis, arthritis, and meningitis can occur in as many as 10% of patients. The case fatality may be as high as 25%. Diagnosis of the condition is made by isolation of salmonel- lae from the blood or from the pus from the suppurative lesion and rarely from feces. Chap-32.indd 280 5/14/2012 3:19:23 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 33 Introduction Shigella is the most common cause of bacillary dysentery, which occurs worldwide. The disease is spread through fecal-oral transmission, and humans are the only natural reservoir of the bacteria. Human infections caused by Shigella species are summarized in Table 33-1. Shigella Based on a combination of biochemical and serological characteristics, shigellae are classified into four species or subgroups, consisting of more than 45 O antigen-based serogroups and each species consisting of different serotypes.Shigella dysenteriae (group A): This is subdivided into 12 serotypes. Each serotype is characterized by the presence of a different type of antigen. S. dysenteriae serotype 1 is the bacillus originally described by Shiga, hence known as Shiga's bacillus. S. dysenteriae serotypes 3-7 were described by Large and Sachs in India, and hence were known as the Large-Sachs group.Shigella flexneri (group B): This group is named after Flexner (1900), who described the first of the mannitol-fermenting shigellae from Philippines. S. flexneri, based on type-specific (I-VI) (1-8) antigens, group is named after Boyd, who first described these strains from India (1931). A total of 19 serotypes have been identified in this group. Members of S. boydii group resemble biochemically, but not antigenically, with those of S. flexneri.Shigella sonnei (group D): This group is named after Sonne, who first described these strains from Denmark (1915). S. sonnei have been divided into 26 colicin types by using 33 indicator strains. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Shigella shows following features: Shigella are short, Gram-negative rods, /H11003 size. They are nonmotile, nonsporing, Shigella species with exceptions of S. flexneri, serotype 6, and some strains of other serotypes possess fimbriae. Culture Shigella are aerobes and facultative anaerobes. They grow at a temperature range of 10-40\u00b0C with an optimum temperature of 37\u00b0C and pH 7.4.1. Nutrient agar: They grow on such or Mueller-Hinton agar. Shigella colonies overnight incubation, are small, circular, convex, smooth, and translucent. Occasionally on primary isolation and frequently in subcultures, a proportion of the colonies may be of the rough type.2. MacConkey However, S. son-nei (which ferments lactose late) forms pale pink colonies are frequently used selective media for isolation of Shigella species. DCA is a useful selec-tive medium for isolation of Shigella spp. from feces. On this medium, Shigella spp. produce small colonies, which on pro- longed incubation produce lactose-fermenting pink colonies. XLD agar is another selective medium, which is less inhibitory to S. dysenteriae and S. flexneri. Shigella spp. forms red colonies on this medium. on SS agar form colorless colonies. media: Selenite F and Gram-negative (GN) broth are commonly used enrichment media. Enrichment of feces in GN broth for 4-6 hours followed by subculture on XLD or HE medium is useful for isolation of Shigella from clinical specimens. Biochemical reactions Shigella shows following reactions: Shigella ferments mannitol, forming acid but no gas. Manni-tol fermentation test is an important biochemical test, which is used to classify shigellae into mannitol-fermenting and -nonfermenting species. S. flexneri, S. boydii, S. fermenting species, while S. dysenteriae is mannitol- nonfermenting species. However, exceptions are not that uncommon.Shigella Bacteria Diseases Shigella species Shigella also ferments glucose, producing acid but without gas. Newcastle and Manchester biotypes of S. flexneri type 6, and some strains of S. boydii types 13 and 14 are exceptions, which do not ferment glucose. They do not ferment lactose, sucrose, salicin, adonitol, or inositol. However, S. sonnei sucrose late. They reduce nitrates to nitrites and do not form H2S. They are MR positive, citrate negative, and oxidase negative. They are catalase positive with exception of S. dysenteriae type 1, which is catalase negative. The biochemical characteristics that are useful for distinguish-ing different Shigella species are listed in Table 33-2. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Shigellae are killed at a temperature of 55\u00b0C in 1 hour or by 1% phenol in 30 minutes. In feces, they die within a few hours due to acidity produced by the growth of intestinal bacteria. They remain viable in moist environments for days, but die rapidly on drying. S. sonnei is in general more resistant to unfavorable environmental conditions than the other Shigella species. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of shigellae, like other Gram-negative bacilli, contains a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure. The LPS is liberated during lysis of the cell and, to some extent, during culture. The LPS moiety functions as an endotoxin and is an important component of the virulence of the bacteria. Antigenic structure The antigenic structure of shigellae is simple, unlike the com-plex antigenic structure of salmonellae. Shigellae possess somatic O certain strains possess K antigens. Shigella K antigens, when present, may sometimes interfere with agglutination by O antisera. Shigellae strains also possess fimbrial antigens. Common fimbrial antigens are also found particularly in S. flexneri. S. flexneri is biochemically heterogeneous and antigenically the most complex among based on type-specific (I-VI) and variants, called X and Y, which lack the type specific antigens are also recognized in addition to this. S. flexneri serotype 6 is always indole negative and is classified into three biotypes: Boyd 88, Manchester, and Newcastle (Table 33-4). S. sonnei is antigenically homogeneous but may occur in two forms: phase I and phase II. Phase I strains produce smooth col-onies, while phase II colonies form large, flat, and more irregu-lar colonies. Cultures contain a mixture of both forms. Usually, phase II strains are isolated more frequently from convalescing cases and from carriers than from patients. Pathogenesis and Immunity Virulence factors Virulence in Shigella species involves both chromosomal- and plasmid-coded genes, which express for many virulence factors (Table 33-5).Endotoxins: The LPS moiety functions as an endotoxin and is an important component of the virulence of the bacteria. The endotoxin plays an important role in resistance of Shigella to nonspecific host defense encountered during tissue invasion. The toxin helps in invasion, multiplication, and resistance of Shigella to phagocytosis by tissue macrophages. The endotoxin increases the cytotoxic activity of Shiga toxin on human vas-cular endothelial cells. The endotoxin is expressed by chromo-somal genes of the bacteria.Intestinal adherence factor: Intestinal adherence factor is a 97-kDa outer membrane protein encoded by each gene on Characteristics dysenteriaeShigella I II II III III III IV IV V V VI - -Group antigens1, 2, 4 1, 2, 4, 6 1, 3, 4 1, 7, 8 1, 6, 7, 8 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 1, 6 1, 3, 4 1, 3, 4, 6 1, 3, 4 1, 7, 8 1, 2, 4 1, 7, 8 1, 3, 4TABLE 33-3 Antigens This mediates colonization of Shigella spp. in infected human hosts and in animal models.Shiga toxin: Shiga toxin is an exotoxin produced by S. dysenteriae. It is a heat-labile protein and acts as enterotoxin and neurotoxin. Shiga toxin (Stx) is a group of cytotoxins that contain two major immunologically non-cross-reactive groups called Stx1 and Stx2. Both Stx1 and Stx2 groups are encoded by a bacteriophage inserted into the chromosome of the bacteria. Shiga toxins have one A subunit and five B subunits: The main function of B subunit is to bind toxins to host cell glycolipid (Gb3) surface receptor, present on the brush border of epithelial cell of the intestines. It also mediates transfer of the A subunit into the cell. Subunit A is a 32-kDa polypeptide. cleaves the 28S rRNA in the 60S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing the binding of aminoacyl-transfer RNA and disrupting protein synthesis. The Shiga toxin shows three types of toxic activities: 1. Neurotoxic activity: This activity is demonstrable by paralysis and death of experimental animal following injection with the toxin. Although called neurotoxin, the primary site of its action is not the neural tissue but is the blood vessels, neurological manifestations being secondary. 2. Enterotoxic activity: These to xins are enterotoxic for ligated rabbit intestinal segments with induction of fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loop. Two new Shigella enterotoxins, designated as S. ET-l and S. ET-2\u2014the former confined to S. flexneri 2a and the latter more widespread\u2014have been identified. 3. Cytotoxic activity: This is demonstrated by cyto toxicity of toxin for vero, HeLa, and some selected endothelial cells, such as human renal vascular endothelial cells. This appears to be the same as vero toxin 1 (or Shiga-like toxin) produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli (VTEe). The primary manifestation of Shiga toxin is damage to the intestinal epithelium of the infected host, causing diarrhea and dysentery. However, in a small number of patients, Shiga toxin can mediate damage to the glomerular endothelial cells, Shigella spp. produce a serious disease known as bacillary dysentery. Infection occurs by ingestion. The infectivity dose (ID) is extremely low. As few as 10 S. dysenteriae bacilli can cause clinical disease, whereas 100-200 bacilli are needed for S. sonnei or S. flexneri infection. Shigella spp. cause disease by invading and replicating in cells lin- ing the intestinal mucosa of the colon. Structural proteins, such as intestinal adhesion factor, endotoxin, and exotoxin mediate the adherence of the bacteria to the cells as well as their invasion, intra-cellular replication, and cell-to-cell spread. The bacilli infect the epithelial cells of the villi in the large intestine and multiply inside them. Subsequently, bacteria spread laterally to involve adjacent cells and penetrate into the lamina propria (Fig. 33-1). Shigellae lyse the cell cyto-plasm. Shigellae survive phagocytosis by inducing programed cell death or apoptosis. This mechanism also leads to the release of interleukin-1/H9252 resulting in the attraction of polymorphonu- clear leukocytes into the infected tissues. This in turn alters the integrity of the intestinal wall and allows the bacteria to reach the deeper epithelial cells. Shiga toxin produced by the bacteria also plays an important role in progression of mucosal lesions after invasion of the colonic cells. The toxin also induces vascu-lar damage the rectosigmoid junction are the typical pathological features primarily observed in the condition.Biochemical properties Boyd 88 Manchester Newcastle Virulence Endotoxins Invasion, multiplication, and resistance of Shigella to phagocytosis by macrophages Intestinal adherence factorColonization of Disrupts protein and Virulence factors of Shigella species Shigella Shigella enters an epithelial cellShigella multiply inside the cellShigella invade neighboring epithelial cells, thus avoiding immune defenses Mucosal abscess3 12 4 An abscess forms as epithelial cells are killed by the infection.

Schematic diagram showing pathogenesis of cause shigellosis, a clinical syndrome encompassing the whole spectrum of disease caused by the bacteria. Bacillary dysentery is a severe clinical form of the shigellosis.Bacillary dysentery: It is an acute gastrointestinal illness mani-fested by fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and tenesmus. Incubation period is usually short. It lasts from 12 hours to 7 days, usually 48 hours, and is inversely related to the load of ingested bacilli. The condition manifests with a sudden onset of high-grade fever along with abdominal cramp, tenesmus, urgency, and passage of loose, scanty feces containing frank blood and mucus. Infection is usually self-limiting. In a small number of patients, asymptomatic colonization of shigellae occurs in the colon, which makes the patient a persistent reservoir for infection. Complications are most often associated with S. dysenteriae type 1 infection. These include: Arthritis, toxic neuritis, conjunctivitis, and, in children, intussusception. Hemolytic uremic syndrome may also occur follow-ing infection with S. dysenteriae because of vasculopathy mediated by Shiga toxin. Reiter syndrome (arthritis, urethritis, conjunctivitis) is usually observed in adults with HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen. Shigella septicemia is rare, except in malnourished children with S. dysenteriae infection. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, bronchopneumo-nia, and multiple organ failure may occur in lethal cases of Shigella septicemia. In patients with HIV infection, shigellosis is often a protracted, chronic, relapsing disease, even when treated with antibiotics and may be complicated by bacteremia. S. sonnei causes the mildest form of bacillary dysentery in many patients; the species may cause only a mild diarrhea. S. flexneri and S. boydii causes more severe illness than that caused by S. sonnei. Epidemiology Shigellosis occurs worldwide. Estimated 150 million cases occur annually worldwide. The incidence of shigellosis in developing countries is nearly 20 times more than in developed countries. It is estimated that 30% of these infections are caused by S. dysenteriae. S. flexneri is the most common cause of shigellosis in devel-oping countries. S. sonnei is the most common cause in the industrial world. Geographical distribution Shigellosis is worldwide in distribution but shows a lot of variations epidemiologically between the nature and extent of the infection in the industrially advanced and in the devel-oping and poor countries. Endemic shigellosis is found in all age groups and is caused by all species in developing countries where environmental sanitation is poor. In India, S. flexneri is the major species and constitutes 50-85% of all Shigella iso-lates followed by boydii (0-8%). Habitat Shigella species are strict human pathogens. They are found in the large intestine of infected human hosts. They are not found in any other animal hosts. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Infected patients or, less often, carriers are reservoirs of infec-tions for shigellosis. Chronic carriage is rare, because the bacilli are not excreted in feces within a few weeks, except in some malnourished children or in patients with AIDS. Shigellosis is transmitted by: Fecal-oral route by hand-to-mouth infection through con-taminated fingers. Because as few as 10-200 bacilli can cause disease, shigellosis spreads rapidly in areas where sanitary standards and the level of personal hygiene are low. Contaminated food and water: Food and water contaminated with human feces containing Shigella spp. is the main source of infection. Fomites such as door handles, water taps, lavatory seats. Flies, which may transmit the infection as mechanical vectors. Sexually among young male homosexuals due to oro-anal contact. Shigellosis is primarily a disease of children. Nearly, 70% of all infections occur in children younger than 15 years. Patients at highest risk for disease are malnourished children, young children in daycare centers, nurseries, and custodial institu-tions; siblings and parents of these children. Shigella infection in malnourished children often causes a vicious cycle of further impaired nutrition, recurrent infection, and further growth retardation. Endemic disease in adults is common in house-hold contacts of infected children and in male homosexuals. Typing of Shigella For epidemiological purposes, Shigella species have been classi-fied into many colicin types, depending upon the biochemical characteristics of the microorganisms. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Stool is the specimen of choice. Diagnosis of shigellosis is made by isolating Shigella spp. from feces. Fresh feces are inoculated without delay or transported in a suitable medium, such as Sachs' buffered glycerol saline, pH 7.0-7.4. Also, rectal swabs may be taken from the site of ulcer by sigmoidoscopy. However, rectal swabs that do not contain copious volume of stool or mucus are not satisfactory. Chap-33.indd 284 33SHIGELLA 285 stool may reveal clumps of polymor-phonuclear leukocytes. Fecal blood or leukocytes are detectable in the stool in approximately 70% of cases of shigellosis. Culture A sample for stool is obtained in all suspected cases of shigellosis for culture. Usually, more than one stool or rectal swab is collected and inoculated immediately on at least two different culture media, such as MacConkey, XLD, DCA, or eosin-methylene blue agars. For enrichment, one tube each of selenite F and GN broth are inoculated and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12-18 hours before subculture onto selective media. After overnight incubation, Shigella produces pale nonlactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey and DCA media and red colonies on XLD medium and colorless colonies on SS agar. Identification of bacteria Pale non-lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar are identified by carrying out motility test, biochemical tests, and slide agglutination test 33-1). Serodiagnosis are not useful in the diagnosis of shigellosis. Treatment Uncomplicated shigellosis is a self-limited condition and patients usually recover spontaneously in a few days. Hence, no antibiotics are recommended for these cases. The dehydra-tion observed in acute cases, particularly in infants and young children, needs adequate replacement of fluids and electrolytes by oral fluid and salts. Antibiotic treatment for Shigella infec- tion is recommended (i ) for severe or toxic cases and (ii) for the very young, debilitated, and the aged individuals. Antibiotic treatment is recommended to decrease the duration of illness, person-to-person spread, and cases in household contacts. In developing countries, treatment in malnourished children is likely to reduce the risk of worsening malnutrition morbidity following shigellosis. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recom-mended for contacts. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and the quinolones, such as nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, are frequently used antibiotics. Trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole is very eff ective for shigellosis. The antibiotics act against Shigella by producing a sequential blockade in folic acid synthesis. This is the drug of choice when antibiotics susceptibility of the bacteria is not known. However, ampicil-lin is still the drug of choice if Shigella isolate is susceptible to this drug.Antibiotics-resistant Shigella: Multiple-antibiotics-resistant plasmids are widely prevalent in shigellae and were first docu-mented in Japan during early 1950s. Most of these strains were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamides. Indiscriminate use of the antibiotics has worsened the prob-lem. Hence, it is essential to treat the cases of shigellosis with the results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing of Shigella. Prevention and Control In developed countries, person-to-person transmission is the most common source of infection. Water contaminated with human excreta is the most common source of infection. Therefore, control consists essentially in improving personal and environmental sanitation. Antibiotics are not used in pro-phylaxis. No effective vaccine is available. 1.

Earlier, the plague bacillus and many other Gram-negative, short bacilli that are primary pathogens of rodents were included in the genus Pasteurella. Now, this group has been divided into three genera: Yersinia, Pasteurella, and Francisella. The genus Yersinia is now included in the tribe Yersinieae in the family Enterobacteriaceae and includes 11 species, three of which are pathogenic in humans. Human infections caused by Yersinia species are summarized in Table 34-1. Yersinia pestis is the most important species that causes plague, an acute and contagious, febrile illness transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected rat flea. Yersinia entero-colitica is other species, which causes mesenteric lymphad-enitis especially in children. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes mesenteric adenitis. Yersinia pestis Plague, caused by Y. pestis, was one of the most devastating diseases in history. Plague has caused large-scale epidemics, thereby changing the course of history in many nations. It has been estimated that up to 200 million people have died from this disease. In the early 20th century, plague epidemics were responsible for about 10 million deaths in India.Y ersinia Bacteria Diseases Yersinia pestis Plague (bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic) Yersinia enterocolitica Enterocolitis primarily children)TABLE 34-1 Human infections caused by Yersinia speciesProperties of the Bacteria Morphology Y. pestis shows the following features: Y. pestis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that measures 1.5 3 0.7 /H9262m in size, with rounded ends and convex sides. The bacilli are arranged in single, in pairs, or in short chains. Pleomorphism is very common. Involution forms, such as coccoid, club-shaped, and filamentous forms are seen in old cultures or when grown on an unfavorable medium, such as nutrient agar containing 3% NaCl. Giemsa or methylene clinical speci-mens show characteristic bipolar staining (safety pin appear-ance) with both ends densely stained and a clear central area of the bacteria. Y. pestis is a nonmotile, nonsporing, and non-acid fast but capsulated bacterium. Culture Y. pestis is aerobic and facultatively anaerobic. It grows at a temperature range of 2-45\u00b0C with an optimum temperature of 27\u00b0C (unlike most bacteria), but it grows better at 37\u00b0C in culture. The bacteria grow at a wide range of pH (5-9.6), with an optimum pH of 7.2.Solid media: Y. pestis can grow on a variety of media includ- ing Mueller-Hinton agar, Y. pestis produces small, delicate, and transparent colonies becoming opaque on pro-longed incubation. III Chapter 34YERSINIA 287 (7 /H9262g/mL) is a selective medium for Y. pestis. Colonies on blood agar are dark brown due to the absorption of the hemin pig-ment. The bacteria grow poorly on MacConkey agar and deoxycholate citrate agar, producing pinpoint reddish colonies after 24 hours of incubation.Liquid media: In broth, Y. pestis produces a flocculent growth with granular deposit at the bottom and along the sides of the tube, with little or no turbidity. On prolonged incubation, a delicate pellicle may form at the surface. Y. pestis produces a characteristic growth when grown in a flask of broth with oil or ghee (clarified butter) floated on top (ghee broth). The growth in the medium appears to hang down into the broth from the surface, resembling stalactites (stalactite growth) . Biochemical reactions Y. pestis shows following: Y. pestis is catalase positive, aesculin positive, and MR positive. It is coagulase positive. It ferments glucose, maltose, and mannitol with production of acid but no gas. Lactose, sucrose, or rhamnose are not fermented. It is oxidase negative, urease negative, and citrate negative. It does not reduce nitrate and does not liquefy gelatin. Indole is not produced. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Y. pestis is sensitive to heat, sunlight, drying, and chemical disinfectants. The bacilli are killed at a temperature of 55\u00b0C in 30 minutes. They are also killed rapidly by disinfectants, such as 0.5% phe-nol in 15 minutes. The bacilli remain viable for long periods in sealed agar slopes, in frozen tissue, and in cold and moist envi-ronments, such as in the soil of rodent burrows. All strains are lysed by a specific antiplague bacteriophage at 22\u00b0C. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of Y. pestis contains a lipopolysaccharide that func-tions as an endotoxin and is an important component of the virulence of the bacteria. Virulence factors Biological functions Plague toxin Causes systemic manifestations of plague F1 envelope antigen Inhibits phagocytosis V and W antigens Inhibit phagocytosis and intracellular killing of the plague bacillus inside macrophages Type III secretion systems Facilitate secretion of virulence factors of Y. pestis into host cellsPrevent phagocytic killing of the pathogenic Yersinia species Plasminogen activator phagocytosis and intracellular killing.TABLE 34-2 Virulent factors Yersinia pestis Antigenic Structure Y. pestis is antigenically homologous; hence no serotypes are present. The antigenic structure of the bacteria is complex and contains about 20 different antigens. Y. pestis possess following major antigens, which are of importance in the pathogenesis of disease:V and W antigens: These two antigens are always present together. V antigen is a protein of molecular weight 90 kDa, while W antigen is an acidic 145 kDa lipoprotein. These two proteins are produced by virulent strains of Y. pestis when grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of low concentration of calcium. Production of V and W antigens is mediated by plasmid.F1 envelope antigen: F1 envelope antigen (fraction I or F-I antigen) is a heat-labile envelope protein generally present only in virulent strains. The antigen is formed in vivo and in vitro in culture of virulent strains at 37\u00b0C. Production of F-I antigen is mediated by plasmid. The antibody to F-I antigen is protective in mice. Pathogenesis and Immunity Y. pestis is a highly virulent bacterium, which causes plague with a high mortality rate. The ability of Yersinia species to resist phagocytic killing is the hallmark of pathogenesis of plague. Serum resistance and the ability of the bacilli to absorb organic iron as a result of a siderophore-independent mechanism fur-ther contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Virulence factors Y. pestis produces many toxins and enzymes, all of which con-tribute to pathogenesis of the diseases. Virulence factors of Y. pestis like that of Salmonella are complex. These are encoded both on the organism's chromosome and on large plasmids (Table 34-2).Plague toxin: The term \"plague toxins\" refers to a complex of at least two different types of toxins: (a) endotoxin and (b) murine toxin, found in culture filtrates or in cell lysates. A. The endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide found in the cell wall and is responsible for man y of the systemic manifesta- tions of the disease caused by Y. pestis. Chap-34.indd 12:11:04 PMSection III Chapter 34288 properties of both exotoxins and endo to xins. (i) It is a heat-labile protein. The toxins may be toxoided but do not dif fuse freely into the medium and are released only by the lysis of the cell. (ii) The toxin is pathogenic in rats and mice but not in guinea pigs and rabbits and in humans and other pri-mates. The murine to xins produce local edema and necrosis with systemic effects on the peripheral vas-cular system and liver in experimental animal infec-tions. The role of murine toxins in the pathogenesis of plague in humans is not known. F1 envelope antigen: F1 envelope antigen is a major virulence factor, which inhibits phagocytosis and plays an important role in conferring protective immunity in humans and in mice.V and W antigens: These two antigens inhibit phagocytosis and intracellular killing of the bacillus inside macrophages.Type III secretion systems: Type III secretion systems (TTSS) consist of many proteins, which facilitate secretion of virulence factors of Y. pestis into host cells. The ability of the pathogenic Yersinia species to resist phagocytic killing is mediated by the TTSS. The bacteria on coming in contact with phagocytic cells in infected hosts secrete a variety of proteins, which prevent phago-cytic killing of the bacteria. Firstly, the proteins secreted into the phagocyte dephosphorylate several proteins required for phago-cytosis (YopH gene product) and then induce cytotoxicity by disrupting actin filaments (YopE gene product). Subsequently, proteins initiate apoptosis in macrophages (YopJ/P gene prod-uct). The TTSS also inhibits production of cytokines, which in turn reduces the inflammatory immune response to infection.Other virulence factors: Yersinia produces the enzymes, such as coagulase, fibrinolysin, and plasminogen activator (pIa) protease, which contributes to virulence of the For example, enzyme plasminogen activator (pIa) protease degrades thereby phagocytic migration, respectively. The enzyme also degrades fibrin clots, thereby facilitating Y. pestis to spread rapidly. The virulence of the bacterium is enhanced further by its ability to absorb organic iron as a result of a sid-erophore-independent mechanism. Pathogenesis of plague Plague in humans can occur either by the bite of a vector, by close contact with infected tissue or body fluids, or by direct inhalation of the bacterium.Bubonic plague: It is a zoonotic disease transmitted by rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis from animals to humans. Y. pestis is a natural parasite of rodents; infection is transmitted and main-tained among them by rat fleas. The fleas acquire the infection by feeding on infected rodents. When rat flea bites an infected and diseased rat, it sucks nearly 0.5 mL of blood per feed con-taining nearly 5000-50,000 plague bacilli. In the stomach of the flea, the bacilli multiply to such an extent that they block the proventriculus and thereby prevent food entry into the stomach. The interval between the ingestion of infected blood and blocking in the proventriculus is referred to as extrinsic incubation period, which varies from 2 to 3 weeks in X. cheopis. The blocked flea, to overcome starvation, begins a blood-suck- ing rampage by biting other rodents. Between its attempts to swal-low, the distended bacillus-packed stomach recoils, depositing the bacilli into the victim's skin, thereby transmitting the infection. When the diseased rat dies, the fleas leave the carcass and in the absence of another rat, may bite human, causing bubonic plague. The bubonic plague is characterized by the pathognomonic \"bubo\". The disease occurs following the bite of rat flea, depos-iting thousands of bacilli into the host's skin during blood meals. The bacilli migrate to the regional lymph nodes, where they are phagocytosed by the polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear phagocytes, and multiply intracellularly. The bacilli the tissue producing the inflamed, and hemorrhagic\u2014lymph node known as bubo (bubon meaning groin), as demonstrated in bubonic plague. Infected lymph nodes show large number of plague bacilli, destruction of the normal architecture, and medullary necrosis. Subsequent spread of bacteria occurs along the lymphatic channels towards the thoracic duct, with eventual distribution of the bacteria in circulation leading to bacteremia and septice-mia. The bacteria, in the absence of specific therapy, potentially infect every organ, including the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and rarely even the meninges.Pneumonic plague: It is transmitted from humans to humans. It occurs following direct inhalation of the bacilli by droplet infection due to close contact with infected hosts or by inhalation of aerosolized bacteria, such as may occur if used as a biological weapon. The bacilli spread through the lungs, producing a severe and rapidly progressive multilobar bron-chopneumonia, subsequently leading to bacteremia and septi-cemia. It is not a zoonotic disease.Septicemic plague: It is usually the terminal stage of the bubonic or pneumonic plague. It may sometimes occur pri-marily. Primary septicemic plague may occur when the plague bacilli are deposited directly in the circulation, bypassing the lymphatics. Early dissemination with sepsis occurs, but without the formation of a bubo. This usually is observed in individuals bitten by the rat flea in the oral, tonsillar, and pharyngeal area and is due to the vascularity of the tissue and short lymphatic distance to the thoracic duct. Host immunity An attack of plague provides a long-lasting immunity to infected humans. Clinical Syndromes Y. pestis causes plague, which occurs in three forms: (a) bubonic plague, (b) pneumonic plague, and (c) septicemic plague. Bubonic plague Bubonic plague is the most common clinical form of the disease. The incubation period varies from 2 to 6 days. The Chap-34.indd 288 5/14/2012 12:11:04 PMSection III Chapter 34YERSINIA 289 condition is associated with a sudden onset of high fever, chills, and headache, and also body aches, extreme exhaustion, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Presence of painful, swollen lymph glands (buboes), usually in the groin, axilla, or neck, is the characteristic manifestation. The buboes are unilateral, oval, and extremely painful. They measure 2-10 cm in size. Inguinal lymph nodes are most commonly involved. Enlargement of the buboes may cause rupture and discharge of foul-smelling pus. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may occur causing tender-ness. Mortality rate for untreated plague is 40-70%. Pneumonic plague Abrupt onset of fever and chills, lymphadenopathy, chest pain, dyspnea, purulent sputum, or hemoptysis are the manifesta-tions of pneumonic plague. Buboes may or may not be present in pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is highly infectious and transmitted by aerosol droplets. The condition if untreated is invariably fatal. Septicemic plague Septicemic plague is usually the terminal event in the bubonic or pneumonic plague, but may sometimes occur primarily in elderly patients. The condition is associated with a rapid onset of symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diar-rhea. Diarrhea may be the predominant symptom. Patients have a toxic appearance due to an overwhelming infection with the plague bacillus and may present with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Hypothermia is common. Generalized pur-pura leading to necrosis and gangrene of the distal extremities may be observed. Buboes are not demonstrated in septicemic plague. Septicemic plague is associated with a high mortality rate, and patients usually die due to a high level of bacteremia. Epidemiology Plague is worldwide in distribution with most of the human cases reported from developing countries. Geographical distribution Most cases of plague occur in the developing countries of Africa and Asia, including Vietnam and India. India is one of the few countries that have been worst hit by the pandemics of plague. Plague first appeared in Bombay in 1896 and spread all over the country, causing more than 10 million deaths by 1918. Thereafter, it gradually receded, though occasional cases continued to occur in endemic foci till 1967. Thereafter, no cases of plague were seen in India till August 1994, during which outbreaks of bubonic plague were reported from Beed district of Maharashtra. One month later, in September 1994, outbreak of pneumonic plague was reported in Surat and adjoining areas of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Nearly, 6000 suspected plague cases and 60 deaths were reported in these outbreaks, which subsided in 2 months. Four fatal cases of plague were reported during an outbreak of plague near Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) in February 2002. In India, at least four natural foci of plague are known, which have contributed to survival of the plague bacilli. These include: The place near Kolar at the of Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, in Himachal Pradesh where the 2002 outbreak origi-nated; and A small pocket in Uttaranchal. Habitat Y. pestis inhabit infected lymph nodes\u2014most commonly inguinal lymph nodes in bubonic plague, lower respiratory tract in pneu-monic plague, and the blood circulation in septicemic plague. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Plague is a zoonotic infection transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected rat flea. Infection may also be transferred by contamination of the bite wound with the feces of infected rat fleas. Human-to-human transmission is rare except during epidemics of pneumonic plague. There are two natural cycles of plague: the urban plague and the wild plague (Fig. 34-1).Urban or domestic plague: Urban plague is maintained in rat populations and is transmitted among rats or between rats and humans by infected rat fleas. In India during earlier years, plague produced epizootics first in sewer rat, Rattus norvegicus. When their number decreased, the disease spread to the domestic rat, Rattus rattus. Domestic rat is the important reservoir of urban plague from which the infection spreads to human beings. The rat flea is the usual vector. Thirty different flea species have been identified as vectors, the most important being X enopsylla cheopis, in north India, while X . astia is in the south India. Cool and humid seasons favor the multiplication of fleas, leading to a high \"flea index\" (mean number of fleas per rat). Hence, plague epidemics occur during the cold season more frequently than in the hot, dry weather, in which fleas do not thrive and the transmission of infection is interrupted. Pneumonic plague Person to person spreadTransmitted by flea bite Sylvatic cycle Wild rodentDomestic rat Urban cycleEpidemiology of plague Bubonicplague No person to sylvatic plague: This occurs between animals and wild rodents independent of human beings. More than 200 different animal species have been identified as hosts. These include domestic cats and dogs, squirrels, chipmunks, mar-mots, deer mice, rabbits, hares, rock squirrels, camels, and sheep. In India, the gerbil (Tatera indica) and the bandicoot are reservoirs for sylvatic plague. A sylvatic stage occurs when humans are infected from these wild animals. Human infection may occur during handling of dead carcasses of infected wild animals and through the ingestion of meat of infected animals. Human infection from inhalation of respiratory droplets from infected cats has also been documented. In enzootic foci, infected fleas may survive for over a year. The bacilli remain alive and even multiply in the soil of unused rodent burrows. Plague bacilli infect new rodents that live in such burrows. This contributes for the long period of quies-cence and subsequent reemergence of plague. Sylvatic plague is difficult to eliminate because the mammalian reservoirs and flea vectors are widespread. Human-to-human spread occurs only in pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is spread by droplet infection and may be seen during epidemics of bubonic plague. Rarely, primary pneumonic plague may occur in epidemic form, as observed in Manchuria during 1910-1912, causing nearly 60,000 deaths. Typing Based on the fermentation of glycerol and reduction of nitrate, Y. pestis has been typed to three distinct types: Y. pestis var. orien-talis, Y. pestis var. antiqua, and Y. pestis var. medievalis (Table 34-3). These biotypes show different geographical distributions. Primary foci of Y. pestis var. orientalis are India, Myanmar, and China. This biotype is also responsible for wild plague in Western USA, South America, and South Africa. Y. pestis var. anti-qua is distributed in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Transbaikalia. Y. pestis var. medievalis is restricted to Southeast Russia. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include bubo aspirates (in bubonic plague), sputum (in pneumonic plague), and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (in septicemic plague). Microscopy Bubo aspirates is collected by injecting 1 mL of sterile saline into the bubo with a 20-G needle. The fluid is aspirated there-after by withdrawing several times. The bubo aspirate smears are stained with Gram, Wright, Wayson, or Giemsa stain for demonstration of the typical bipolar (safety pin) morphology of Y. pestis. Blood and CSF of patients who are septicemic can also be stained to reveal the bacteria. Key Points Gram stain of the aspirate of the fluid from the inguinal lymph nodes shows Gram-negative coccobacilli with a characteristic bipolar appearance that resembles a closed safety pin and also shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Wayson stain of the aspirate smear shows Y. pestis as light-blue bacilli with dark-blue polar bodies. A direct fluorescent anti-body test employing monoclonal antibodies is a rapid diag-nostic method to demonstrate Y. pestis F1 antigen in blood or sputum samples. A positive fluorescence antibody test on smears or cultures is presumptive evidence of infection. Culture Isolation of Y. pestis by culture confirms the diagnosis of plague. The organism can be isolated from blood, CSF, sputum, and bubo aspirates, depending on the clinical presentation, whether it is bubonic, pneumonic, or septicemic. Y. pestis is slow grow-ing, but it does not require any special growth media. Clinical specimens are inoculated on blood or nutrient agar and on specialized selective media for isolation of Y. pestis. Selective medium, such as blood agar with sodium azide is used for selective isolation of Y. pestis from sputum and bubo aspirates containing numerous other bacteria. Identification of colonies Dark-brown colonies on blood agar and pinpoint colonies on MacConkey agar are the characteristic features of colonies of Y. pestis. The identifying features of Y. pestis colonies are sum-marized in Box 34-1. Animal inoculation Y. pestis can be isolated from bubo aspirate or sputum by inoculat-ing in guinea pigs or white rats. The bubo aspirate is injected sub-cutaneously into the animal. Y. pestis causes death of the animal within 2-5 days. Postmortem of the dead animal shows necrosis and edema at the site of inoculation. Draining lymph nodes are enlarged, congested and show grayish white patches. Gram- and methylene blue-stained smears of lymph nodes, spleen, and heart blood reveal typical bipolar stained Gram-negative bacilli.

The bacteria present in the specimen penetrate the skin through minute abrasions. Bacilli are demonstrated in the sputum and in the blood from the heart of the guinea pig, which dies 2-3 days after inoculation. Serodiagnosis Serological tests usually supplement diagnosis plague. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) tests are employed to detect specific antibodies in acute and convalescent sera. A fourfold or greater difference in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera collected 10 days apart, demonstrated by ELISA or IHA, suggests plague infection. A single positive ELISA or IHA test in a patient who has not received plague vaccine nor has had previous plague is also presumptive of infection. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been evaluated for detection of Y. pestis genome in bubo aspirates. Though not yet widely available, it shows promise. Treatment Treatment of a suspected case of plague with antibiotics should be started as early as possible, without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Immediate treatment with antibiotics has dramat-ically reduced mortality due to the disease. Streptomycin, doxycy-cline, and chloramphenicol are used effectively for treatment of plague. Treatment with antibiotics is usually given for a duration of 10 days. A two-drug regimen should be used in severe cases. Streptomycin is the drug of choice to treat plague. Doxycycline is given in patients who are allergic to streptomycin or who cannot tolerate streptomycin. Chloramphenicol is the drug of choice in septicemic plague or for patients with hypotension. In patients with hypotension, intramuscularly administered streptomycin may be poorly absorbed. Resistance of Y. pestis to streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol is very rare. Prevention and Control These include immunoprophylaxis by plague vaccine, chemo-prophylaxis by antibiotic therapy, and environmental sanitation. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy Prophylactic antibiotic therapy includes prophylaxis with tet-racycline or streptomycin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has also been effective for prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended for: Contacts of pneumonic plague victims. People who have been exposed to the bites of rodent fleas during a plague outbreak. Persons who have handled an animal known to be infected with the plague bacilli. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for contacts with bubonic or septicemic plague. Environmental sanitation Identifying the source of infection is the key component in pre-venting outbreaks of plague. Rodent control forms the mainstay of prevention of plague in urban area. Trained professionals should apply chemicals to kill fleas and rodents. Education of public in rural plague-endemic areas to avoid handling sick or dead rats and to avoid places where wild animals live is important. Yersinia enterocolitica Y. enterocolitica is a well-recognized enteric bacterium that causes distinctive clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infections to life-threatening sepsis, especially in children. Schleifstein and Coleman were first to describe Y. enterocolitica in 1939. Y. enterocolitica is a Gram-negative coc- cobacillus that is motile at but not 37\u00b0C. This bacil-lus resembles Y. pseudotuberculosis in being motile at 22\u00b0C, but differs from it in fermenting sucrose and cellobiose and decar-boxylating ornithine. Many strains of Y. enterocolitica are VP and indole positive. They do not ferment rhamnose or meli-biose. They are oxidase negative and nonlactose fermenting. Y. enterocolitica are aerobes and at an optimum tem- perature of 22-29\u00b0C. Y. enterocolitica grows well at a pH of 5-9; hence the increased incidence of Y. enterocolitica infection is seen in patients who take antacids and H 2 blockers. The bacteria require iron to survive; hence Yersinia sepsis has been reported in children following accidental iron overdose and in hemo-chromatosis, clinical states of iron overload. They grow well on commonly used basic enteric media. On MacConkey agar, they produce pinpoint colorless colonies after 24 hours of incubation. On blood agar, they form nonhe-molytic smooth and translucent colonies measuring 2-3 mm in diameter after 2 days of incubation at 22\u00b0C. Cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar is a frequently used selective medium for Y. enterocolitica. Laboratory and field workers who come in contact with the plague bacillus or Individuals residing in endemic areas who cannot avoid exposure to rodents or fleas. The vaccine is not effective against the pneumonic plague. Vaccines A killed vaccine for plague is available in India. It is a whole culture antigen prepared at the Haffkine Institute, Mumbai. A virulent strain of Y. pestis is cultured in casein hydroly-sate broth for 2-4 weeks at 32\u00b0C, followed by inactivation with 0.05% formaldehyde and preservation in phenyl mer-curic nitrate. The vaccine contains 2000 millions of plague bacilli/mL. A series of three injections of 0.5 mL of vaccine is given subcutaneously. Two doses are given at an interval of 1-3 months, followed by a third dose at the sixth month. The vaccine confers protection only for 6 months against bubonic plague. The vaccine is recommended for: Chap-34.indd 291 5/14/2012 12:11:04 PMSection structure of Y. enterocolitica is distinct. Y. enterocolitica possesses 34 different O antigen factors and 19 H factors. On the basis of these antigens, more than 60 O serotypes have been reported. Most human isolates belong to serotypes O:3, O:5, 27; O:8 and represent the most virulent worldwide causes of human yersiniosis. Virulence of Y. enterocolitica is chromosomal or plasmid mediated. Humans acquire infection by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacteria. On ingestion, the bacteria adhere to the mucosa of terminal ileum, penetrate, and mul-tiply in Peyer patches. The bacteria induce an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. The outer membrane protein is an important virulence factor that mediates adherence and invasion of the organism. The bacteria may then spread to the mesenteric lymph nodes and may cause bacteremia, or form abscesses and pain in the right lower quadrant that simulate appendicitis. Although Y. enterocolitica produce a heat-stable enterotoxin similar to that of Escherichia coli, the enterotoxin does not contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Y. enterocolitica causes enterocolitis primarily in young children, pseudoappendicitis syndrome, and extraintestinal infections. Enterocolitis is the most common clinical form of the disease, which occurs primarily in young children, with a mean age of 24 months. The incubation period is short, varies from 4 to 6 days. The condition manifests as watery, mucoid diarrhea in majority of patients; fever, colicky abdominal pain, bloody stools; and leukocytes in the stool. Diarrhea usually lasts from 1 day to 3 weeks. Most cases are self-limited. Y. enterocolitica infection causes mesenteric lymphadenitis with terminal ileitis. The condition, known as pseudoap-pendicitis syndrome, is more common in older children and young adults, and mimics appendicitis. It is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, tenderness in the right lower quad-rant, and leukocytosis. The pseudoappendicitis syndrome is also caused by infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis. Extraintestinal infections, such as cellulitis, conjunctivitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and uri-nary tract infection caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis are rare. Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolation of Y. enterocolitica from stool by culture. Stool culture is positive within 2 weeks of onset of disease. Tube agglutination, ELISA, and radioim-munoassays are frequently used tests to detect antibodies in sera for diagnosis of the condition. Antibody titers rise 1 week after onset of illness and reach maximal levels at 2 weeks; raised antibody levels can be found for years after infection. Antibody titers more than 1:128 are suggestive of a previous infection with Y. enterocolitica. Good nutrition and hydration are the mainstays of treat- ment. The role of antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated acute colitis and mesenteric adenitis is not established. Antibiotic therapy is indicated only for patients (a) with septicemia, (b) with focal extraintestinal manifestations, and ( c) with enterocolitis who are immunocompromised. Tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are the antibiotics of choice. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Y. pseudotuberculosis is the least common of the three main Yersinia species to cause human infections. The bacillus was first described in 1889; first it was named as Pasteurella and then Shigella pseudotuberculosis. In 1960s, it was given the cur- rent name Y. pseudotuberculosis. Znamenskiy, a Russian worker, demonstrated the pathogenicity of the bacteria through self-inoculation. Y. pseudotuberculosis is a small, ovoid, and bipolar stained Gram-negative bacillus. It is nonsporing, noncapsulated, and slightly acid fast. It is motile at 22\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C. The bacterium is oxidase negative, catalase positive, and urease positive. It is non-lactose-fermenting coccobacillus that is dif-ferentiated from other species, such as Y. enterocolitica , by its fermentation of sorbitol, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and other tests (Table 34-4). TABLE 34-4 Differentiating features of Yersinia species Properties Yersinia pestis Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Yersinia enterocolitica aerobic and facultatively anaero- bic; and optimum growth occurs on MacConkey or eosin-meth-ylene blue (EMB) agar medium at 20-35\u00b0C. The growth of the bacteria is enhanced noticeably at lower temperatures (e.g., 4\u00b0C cold enrichment in buffered saline). The bacteria grow slowly on blood and chocolate agar plates, forming small colonies, gray and translucent colonies, at 24-72 hours of incubation. Y. pseudotuberculosis has been classified into 6 serotypes (I-VI) and a number of subtypes, of which the O group, types I and II, are mainly responsible for human diseases. Approximately, 80% of human diseases are caused by type I serotypes. The bacteria show antigenic cross-reactivity with Y. pestis as well as salmonellae. Y. pseudotuberculosis in experimentally infected guinea pigs produces multiple nodules in the lungs, spleen, and liver, resem-bling tuberculous lesions, hence named pseudotuberculosis. Humans acquire infections primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food products. An inoculum of 10 9 organisms is the infective dose. Y. pseudotuberculosis causes a variety of clini-cal diseases, such as mesenteric lymphadenitis, granulomatous disease, and dissemination with sepsis. Patients with advanced liver disease and evidence of cirrhosis are more likely to develop a septic disease. Y. pseudotuberculosis primarily causes gastroenteritis. The incu- bation period varies from 5 to 10 days. Gastroenteritis is char-acterized by a self-limited mesenteric lymphadenitis simulating acute appendicitis. Fever, abdominal pain (often right lower quadrant location), and rash are a major triad of Y. pseudotubercu-losis infection. Diarrhea is not common. Erythema nodosum and reactive arthritis are the noted late complications of the infection. Izumi fever, a syndrome, is caused by Y. pseudotuberculosis. The condition is characterized by scarlatiniform rash, sys-temic symptoms, and coronary artery aneurysms. The Far East scarlatinoid fever is another syndrome caused by the bacteria. Presence of a scarlatinoid-appearing rash on the head and neck, erythema on the upper and lower extrem-ity, mucous membrane enanthem, and strawberry tongue are characteristic features of the syndrome. Erythema nodosum, arthralgias, reactive arthritis, and anky-losing spondylitis and terminal ileitis and intussusceptions, especially in children, are the other clinical manifestations of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection.Y. pseudotuberculosis infection is distributed worldwide. Most cases occur in winter months, because a cold temperature favors the growth and multiplication of the bacteria. Most cases have been reported in Europe. Nevertheless, large-scale outbreaks have also been documented in the Aomori region of Japan in the early 1990s, and in children consuming untreated drinking water in Okayama, Japan, in 1991. Cases of septicemia are less; less than 30 cases of septicemia have been reported in the world literature. Y. pseudotuberculosis is primarily a zoonotic infection. The animal reservoirs include many mammalian and avian hosts, such as horses, cattle, dogs, deer, cats, rabbits, rodents, and birds (e.g., geese, turkey, ducks, canaries, cockatoos). Butchers working in abattoirs slaughtering swine are at an increased risk to Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. The laboratory diagnosis of Y. pseudotuberculosis infection is made by the following methods: Isolation of the bacteria by culture from stool, blood, CSF, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, or other organ-based biopsy (e.g., intestinal tissue, skin). Isolation of bacteria from stool is difficult, given the slow growth pattern and overgrowth of normal fecal flora. However, stool culture may be facilitated by cold enrich-ment, using special culture media, such as CIN agar, or by alkali treatment. Histological examination of specific tissue, such as mesen-teric lymph nodes, may show both pathologic and microbio-logic presence of organism. ELISA and agglutination tests are employed for demonstra-tion of serum antibodies, which may appear soon after the onset of illness but decrease over a period of 2-6 months. A rise in agglutinating antibodies in paired serum samples, collected after 2 weeks, is suggestive of the diagnosis. How-ever, the test shows false positive reactions in sera from patients infected with Yersinia, Vibrio, Salmonella, Brucella, and Rickettsia species due to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies. Antibiotic therapy is indicated only for younger patients with critical illness, and in the immunocompromised patients. Tetracycline, aminopenicillins, and aminoglycosides are the antibiotics frequently used for treatment of the condition. A 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a sudden onset of high fever, chills, and headache, and also body aches, extreme exhaustion, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed the presence of painful, swollen lymph glands in the groin. Aspirate from the bubo on Gram staining showed pleomorphic Gram-negative coccobacilli. Y. pestis was isolated from the specimen by culture. The case was diagnosed to be bubonic plague. What is the other rapid method for demonstration of Y. pestis in bubonic aspirate? What are the serological tests available for diagnosis of the condition? What is the biotype of Y. pestis found in India? What are the foci of Y. pestis infection in India? What is the vaccine available for prevention of plague? Describe the vaccines available against the disease.CASE STUDY Chap-34.indd 293 5/14/2012 12:11:04 PM35 and facultative anaerobes, nonsporing, catalase and oxidase positive. They reduce nitrates to nitrites and can grow on ordinary media. The family Vibrionaceae includes the genera Vibrio, that are motile by presence of polar flagellum. The name \"vibrio\" is derived from the characteristic vibratory motility (from vibrare, meaning to vibrate). They are asporogenous and noncapsulated. Vibrios are natural inhabitants of sea water but are also found in fresh water worldwide. The genus Vibrio consists of at least 33 species of curved bacilli, of which 12 species have been implicated in human infections. Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus are the causing human infections (Table 35-1). Vibrio cholerae V. cholerae is the most important species that causes cholera, the most feared epidemic diarrheal disease. Dehydration and death can occur rapidly within a matter of hours of infection. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology V. cholerae shows following features: V. cholerae are Gram-negative bacilli with rounded or slightly pointed ends. They measure 1-3 /H9262 m in length and 0.5-0.8 /H9262 m in diameter. Vibrio, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas The bacteria are typically comma shaped (Fig. 35-1). S-shaped or spiral forms may be seen due to two or more cells lying end to end. They are frequently pleomorphic in old cultures. In a stained film of mucous flakes from a case of cholera, the vibrios are typically arranged in parallel rows, described by Koch as the \"fish in stream\" appearance. They are actively motile by the presence of a single polar fla-gellum. They show typical darting type motility and appear as a \"swarm of gnats\" when examined under the microscope. It is nonsporing, noncapsulated, and nonacid fast. Culture V. cholerae is strongly aerobic and grows best under aerobic con-ditions, whereas growth is scanty and slow under anaerobic conditions. It grows within a temperature range of 16-40\u00b0C (optimum 37\u00b0C). It grows better in an alkaline medium, the range of pH being 7.4-9.6 (optimum 8.2). Sodium chloride (0.5-1%) is required for optimal growth, though high concentrations (5% and above) are inhibitory for growth of the bacteria. Unlike other halophilic bacteria, V. cholerae can grow in the absence of salt. FIG. 35-1. AND PLESIOMONAS 295 V. cholerae grows well on a wide variety of media including nonselective media (e.g., nutrient agar, MacConkey agar, blood and peptone water) and special media (trans-port media, enrichment media, and selective media).1. Nonselective media : On nutrient agar, V. cholerae after over- night incubation produces moist, translucent colonies with a bluish or greenish tinge. The colonies measure about 1-2 mm in diameter. The colonies emit a distinctive odor. The colonies on MacConkey agar are initially colorless after overnight incu-bation, but become reddish on prolonged incubation due to the late fermentation of lactose. On blood agar, V. cholerae biotype Eltor produces hemolytic colonies. Biotype Classical strains, however, produce greenish discoloration around the colonies, which later becomes clear due to hemodigestion. In gelatin stab culture, V. incubation at 22\u00b0C. In peptone water, growth of bacteria forms a fine sur-face pellicle in about 6-9 hours of incubation.2. Transport media: Transport media are used to transport stool samples in case of delay in processing the specimens in laboratory. These help in maintaining viability of V. cholerae and prevent the bacteria from being inhibited by normal intes-tinal bacterial flora present in stool specimens. Venkatraman-Ramakrishnan (VR) medium and Cary-Blair medium are two frequently used transport media. VR medium: This is a simple liquid medium prepared by dis-solving 20 g crude sea salt and 5 g peptone in 1L of distilled water. It is an alkaline medium with a pH of 8.6-8.8. The medium is dispensed in screw-capped bottles in volumes of 10-15 mL amounts. About 1-3 mL stool is to be added to each bottle. Cary-Blair medium: This is a solid medium. It consists of buffered solution of sodium chloride, sodium thioglycollate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, calcium chloride, and agar with an alkaline pH of 8. It is a suitable transport medium for Vibrio spp. as well as for Salmonella and Shigella spp. 3. Enrichment media: The enrichment media for V. cholerae are liquid media with a high pH. The high pH of the media suppresses growth of many commensal intestinal bacteria but favors the growth of V. peptone water (APW) and Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water are two examples of transport media used for V. cholerae. APW: It is a frequently used medium for enrichment of stool specimens from patients convalescing from cholera, excret-ing few bacteria in their stool. The pH of APW is 8.6. Nearly 1 g of stool or rectal swab is inoculated into 10 mL of APW in a screw-capped tube and is transported to the laboratory. The APW is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3-6 hours, and afterwards the subculture is made on the selective media. Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water: Potassium tellurite solution is added to the medium to make it more selective for V. cholerae. pH of the medium is 9.0. Stool or rectal swab is inoculated into the medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3-6 hours, and afterwards the subculture is made on the selective media.4. Selective media: These media are useful for isolation of V. cholerae and other vibrios from feces. These include (BSA). All these media charcteristically have a high pH, which sup-presses growth of other intestinal bacteria but favors growth of vibrios. TCBS medium (pH 8.6): produces large, yellow convex colonies on this medium (Color Photo 35). This is due to fermenta-tion of sucrose by the bacteria, leading to production of acid. Accumulation of acid reduces pH of the medium, and so the color of the bromothymol blue indicator becomes yellow, thus making V. cholerae colonies yellow. Nonsu-crose-fermenting V. parahaemolyticus produces blue green colonies. Monsur's GTTA medium (pH 8.5): High pH of the medium and presence of potassium tellurite in this medium inhib-its most of Gram-positive bacteria and enteric bacteria with exception of Proteus species. Hence, the GTTA medium is used for isolation of V. cholerae and other vibrios from feces. V. cholerae produces small, translucent colonies with gray-ish black center and a turbid halo after 24 hours of incu-bation. The colonies become larger (3-4 mm in size) after a prolonged incubation of 48 hours. Alkaline BSA (pH 8.2): This is another selective medium used for V. cholerae . The colonies on BSA are similar to those on nutrient agar. Biochemical reactions V. cholerae shows following features: It is catalase positive and oxidase positive. V. cholerae ferments sugars with production of acid only (no gas). It ferments glucose, sucrose, maltose, mannitol, and mannose. It is a late lactose fermenter ferments lactose on incubation for several days. It does not ferment arabinose, inositol, and dulcitol. It forms indole and reduces nitrates to nitrites. V. cholerae shows positive cholera red reaction by producing a reddish pink color in the peptone water due to formation of nitroso indole. The two properties of formation of indole and reduction of nitrates to nitrites form the basis of cholera red reaction. This reaction is tested by adding a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid to a 24-hour peptone water cul-ture at 37\u00b0C. It is methyl red positive and urease test negative. It liquefies gelatin and decarboxylates lysine and ornithine, but not arginine. V. Eltor variable Voges-Proskauer hemolysis of sheep RBCs, and hem-agglutination of chick RBCs. The differences between Classical and Eltor biotypes of V. cholerae are summarized in 5/14/2012 3:09:59 PMSection III Chapter 35296 BACTERIOLOGY properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: V. cholerae is most susceptible to heat, drying, acids, and common disin-fectants. V. cholerae are killed by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 min- utes, killed in a few minutes in gastric juice of normal acidity. They are resistant to high alkalinity. They remain viable for 1-2 weeks in fresh sea water. They survive in pure tap water for up to 30 days. On fruits, they survive for 1-5 days at room temperature and for a week in the refrigerator. However, vibrios do not survive longer in grossly contaminated water, such as river Ganga water in India\u2014most possible due to the presence of large number of bacteriophages in this water. They survive for several days in untreated excreta of humans. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure V. cholerae like that of Gram-negative bacilli also possesses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The LPS has no role in the pathogen-esis of cholera but is responsible for the immunity produced by killed V. cholerae vaccine. V. cholerae possesses two antigens: Somatic O antigen is present in the cell wall of the bacteria. It is a group-specific antigen. Flagellar H antigen is a heat-labile antigen present in the flagella and is shared by all strains of V. cholerae. Serological classification V. cholerae has been classified according to somatic carbohy-drate O antigen into many serotypes. This serological classi-fication was suggested by Gardner and Venkatraman (1935). More than 200 serotypes have been described, which have been classified broadly into two groups\u2014V. cholerae O1 vibrios or agglutinable vibrios. V. cholerae O1 is subdivided into two biotypes\u2014Eltor and Classical, on the basis of their biochemical parameters. Each biotype has been divided further into three subtypes\u2014Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima (Table 35-3). This classification is based on the differences in minor O antigens, such as A, B, C. Serotype Ogawa contains A and B antigens, Inaba contains A and C antigens, and Hikojima contains all three antigens A, B, and C. Hence, Hikojima strains are agglutinated by both Ogawa and Inaba antisera, whereas Ogawa and Inaba strains are by their own specific antisera only. Non-O1 V. cholerae, which do not agglutinate with designated from to O139. Of these serotypes, only V. cholerae O139 causes cholera in humans. Rest of the serotypes (O2-O138) do not cause any disease in humans. Phage typing V. cholerae O1 biotype Classical has been divided into five types on the basis of four phages (I, II, III, and IV). All these phages lyse biotype Classical but not Eltor strains. On the basis of these four phages and an additional fifth phage, V. cholerae bio-type Eltor can also be divided into six types. Biotyping On the basis of fermentation of mannose, sucrose, and arabi-nose, Vibrios have been classified by Heiberg (1934) into six groups (I, II, III, IV, V, and VI); subsequently, two more groups have been added. V. cholerae belongs to group I. Pathogenesis and Immunity Cholera is a toxin-mediated disease. Cholera toxin (CTx) pro-duced by V. cholerae is the key virulence factor of the bacteria. Virulence factors Virulence factors of V. cholerae include (i) cholera toxin, (ii) toxin and (vi) siderophores (Table 35-4). Most of these virulence factors are expressed by multiple chromosomal genes present PropertiesVibrio An exotoxin and the most important virulence factor pro-duced by V. cholerae. Also known as choleragen or cholera enterotoxin; it is structurally and functionally similar to the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli. It cholerae V. parahaemolyticus - food- associated diarrhea V. vulnificus - wound infection; diagram showing classification of the genus Vibrio. Virulence factors Biological functions Cholera toxin The toxin inhibits absorption of sodium and chloride in the intestine; causes hypersecretion of large volumes of water and electrolytes. Activation of adenylate cyclase and overproduction of cAMP. Toxin coregulated pilus Helps in adherence of Vibrio cholerae to mucosal cells of the intestine Accessory colonization Helps in adhesion of bacteria to the intestinal mucosa Hemagglutination-protease (mucinase) Induces intestinal inflammation and also helps in releasing free vibrios from the bound mucosa to the intestinal lumen Neuraminidase Increases toxin receptors for Vibrio cholerae Siderophores Vibrio choleraemolecular weight 85,600 kDa, and is destroyed by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Contains two subunits\u2014A and B. The genes CTx A and CTx B are responsible for expression of these two subunits of cholera toxin. Consists of a single A subunit of molecular weight 27,215 kDa and five B subunits each of molecular weight 11,677 kDa. The A (active) subunit is responsible for the biological activity of the toxin. Subunit A consists of two fragments\u2014A1 and A2, which remain covalently connected by a single disulfide bond. The A2 fragment is responsible for linking active A fragment to the B subunit.A1 fragment is responsible for the biological activity of the toxin. The A1 subunit stimulates cell-bound cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn converts ATP to cAMP in the intestines of epithelial cells of the gut. Cholera toxin has the following biological functions: This inhibits the absorption capacity and activates the excre-tory chloride transport in the intestinal enterocytes, even-tually leading to loss of sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen. The osmolality in the intestinal lumen is balanced by secretion of large quantities of water, which eventually overcomes the absorptive capacity and leads to diarrhea. The diarrheic fluid is isotonic in nature but contains much more of potassium and bicarbonate. It also inhibits absorption of sodium and chloride in the intestine.in V. cholerae. These genes include the genes for cholera toxin (CTx A and increases skin capillary permeability. Hence, it is also called as a permeability factor. The permeability factor can be detected by skin bluing test. In this test, cholera toxin is injected intradermally in rabbits or guinea pigs, followed by intravenous injection of Evans blue. In a positive test, the skin at the site of injection becomes blue due to increased capillary permeability. The cholera toxin can be demonstrated by the following tests: 1. Rabbit ileal loop test was one of the classical methods developed by De and Chatterjee in 1952. It is a widely used me thod in which injection of V. cholerae culture or culture filtrate into the ligated ileal loop causes accumulation of fluid, leading to ballooning of the ileal loop. 2. ELISA and RIF (rapid immunofluorescence) tests. 3. Chemical estimation of cAMP in tumor cells that have been treated with the toxin. 4. Demonstration of histological changes in adrenal tumor (Y1) cells, elongation of Chinese hamster ovar y cells, and activation of lipolysis in rat testicular tissue. Toxin coregulated pilus: The pili help in adherence of V. cholerae to mucosal cells of the intestines.Accessory colonization: These also help in adhesion of bacte-ria to the intestinal mucosa.Hemagglutination-protease (mucinase): This and fibronectin as well as subunit of the cholera toxin. It induces intestinal inflammation and also helps in releasing free vibrios from the bound mucosa to the intestinal lumen.Neuraminidase: The enzyme destroys neuraminic acid, thereby increasing toxin receptors for the V. cholerae. Siderophores: It is responsible for sequestration of iron. Pathogenesis of Cholera V. cholerae usually enters the body orally through contaminated water and food (Fig. 35-3). Gastric acidity is the first line of defense against infection caused by V. cholerae, because vibrios are highly susceptible to the acidity of stomach. The conditions that reduce acidity of the stomach to pH above 5 make the host more susceptible to infection by cholera vibrios. On reaching the small intestine by using its own mecha- nisms, such as motility, chemokines, and production of enzymes (hemagglutinin and protease), V. cholerae reaches the mucous layer of the small intestine. Hemagglutinin and prote-ase break mucin and fibronectin of the mucosa. Subsequently, bacteria adhere to the intestinal wall facilitated by TCP. This synchronous action of CTx, TCP, and a few other virulence factors is regulated by Tox R gene products, which is known as the master switch. Vibrios, once adhered to the intestinal wall, produce cholera toxin. The toxin activates cAMP, which inhibits the absorption of sodium transport and activates the excretory chloride trans-port in the intestinal epithelial cells. This leads to an accumu-lation of sodium chloride in the lumen of intestine. The high osmolarity of the intestinal fluid is balanced by large secre-tion of water, which overcomes the absorptive capacity of the lumen, eventually causing diarrhea (Fig. 35-4). V. cholerae O139 strain shows a similar pathogenic mecha- nism to that of V. cholerae O1 except that it produces a unique O139 LPS and an immunologically related O antigen cap-sule. These two virulence factors enhance virulence of this organism. These are also responsible for increase in its resis-tance to human serum in vitro and development of bacte-remia occasionally seen during the infection caused by the bacteria. Host immunity Immunity in cholera may be produced against the cholera toxin or against the bacteria. Natural infections in cholera induce some degree of immunity for a short duration of 6-12 months. Reinfection occurs in the same person after this period. Vaccination with killed cholera vaccine confers a short-lived Binding of CT to receptor through the B subunit Entry of the A subunit into cell membrane Activation of Gs leading to activation of adenylate cyclase Increased levels of cAMP Active secretion of electrolytes and water leading to massive diarrhea FIG. 35-4. Pathogenesis of diarrhea ingested Colonization factors:- motility- mucinase- attachment to specific FIG. Colonization of Vibrio Chapter 35VIBRIO, AEROMONAS, AND PLESIOMONAS 299 protection. Live oral vaccines induce local immunity by pro-duction of IgA antibodies in the gut. The immunity induced by these oral vaccines is also short lived. An infection by V. cholerae biotype Classical usually protects against the infection caused by V. cholerae biotype Classical as well as Eltor strains. But infec- tion by V. cholerae biotype Eltor does not confer against biotype Classical. Clinical Syndromes V. cholerae causes cholera (an acute diarrheal disease), which may be rapidly fatal, if not treated immediately. Cholera The incubation period is short and varies from 2 to 3 days after ingestion of the bacteria. The condition shows an abrupt onset of watery diarrhea and vomiting. Profuse watery diarrhea is the most important manifestation of cholera. The volume of diarrheic stool excreted in cholera is much more than that of diarrhea caused by any other infectious pathogen. In a severe condition, patients may excrete as high as 250 mL of stool per kg body weight in a day. The cholera stool: is profusely watery that is colorless and odorless, free of pro-teins and speckled with mucous and often is described as rice water stool (in color and consistency, stool resembles water that has been washed off from cooked rice); contains few leukocytes, but no erythrocytes because V. cholerae does not stimulate any inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa; and is a bicarbonate-rich electrolyte fluid, which contains little protein. Severe abdominal cramp, possibly caused by distension of the small intestine due to excretion of larger volumes of intesti-nal fluid, is also seen in these patients. Vomiting is another important manifestation of cholera and occurs in early stage of the disease. This is caused by decreased gastric and intestinal motility. Cholera if left untreated can lead to severe loss of fluid and electrolytes due to diarrhea and vomiting. This could lead to isotonic dehydration, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and hypovolemic shock. Dehydration in cholera characteristically develops very fast, within hours after the onset of symptoms. This rapid develop-ment of dehydration is not seen with diarrheal diseases caused by any other enteropathogen. In patients with severe disease, diarrhea leads to vascular prolapse and shock, and patients may die of cardiac arrhythmia and renal failure. Other compli-cations include electrolyte imbalance and hypoglycemia. In untreated patients, case fatality rate has been estimated to vary from 25% to 50%. In patients treated well with replace-ment of lost fluid and electrolytes, the case fatality is usually less than 1%. V. cholerae O139 causes cholera, which can be as severe as that caused by V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae O139 may occasionally cause invasive disease producing bacteremia.Epidemiology V. cholerae are found naturally in estuary and marine environ-ment worldwide. Geographical distribution Cholera continues to be a major health problem in many parts of the world including Indian subcontinent and sub-Sahara in Africa. The condition is rare in the developed and industrious nations for the last many decades. A large num-ber of cases of cholera have been reported in the year 2004 from a total of 56 countries from different parts of the world. A total of 101,338 cases and 2345 deaths were reported from these countries. Majority of cases were reported from Africa and Asia. Cholera occurs as an endemic, epidemic, or a pan-demic disease.Cholera pandemics: A total of six pandemics of cholera occurred in the nineteenth century, affecting Europe and the United states, causing more than 115,000 deaths in 1832 and 50,000 deaths in 1856. The seventh pandemic of cholera appeared first in the twentieth century starting in 1961 and affected five continents by 1991. Unlike six earlier pandemics, which were caused by V. cholerae biotype Classical, the seventh pandemic was caused by V. cholerae biotype Eltor. The latter originated in Asia in the 1960s, reached Africa in the early 1970s, and was responsible for epidemic cholera. In 1991, the pandemic reached Peru and subsequently spread rapidly through many countries of South and Central America as well as in the United States and Canada. By mid-1995, more than 1 million cases and 10,000 deaths due to the disease were reported in the United States. The seventh pandemic of chol-era was different from previous pandemics of cholera in the following ways: 1. It was the first pandemic to be originated from outside Indian subcontinent. It was originated from Sulaw esi (Celebes), Indonesia. From here, it spread to Hong Kong and Philippines and entered India in 1964. By 1966, it entered and spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and West Asia. The pandemic then spread to Africa and parts of Southern Europe in 1970s. 2. It was the first pandemic to be caused by V. c holerae bio- type Eltor in contrast to earlier six pandemics caused by V. cholerae biotype Classical. 3. V. cholerae biotype Eltor , responsible for seventh pandemic, caused a less severe illness with a large proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections. Mortality rate was low, but characteristically carrier rate was high. 4. V. cholerae biotype Eltor has nearly replaced the V. cholerae biotype Classical strain following this pandemic spread. Hence, in countries like India, V. cholerae Classical strains are rarely encountered, but in Bangladesh, there has been a resurgence of cholera caused by V. cholerae Classical strains. In 1992, a new epidemic strain V. cholerae O139 has emerged as a cause of epidemic cholera in India. This new epidemic strain Chap-35.indd 299 5/14/2012 3:09:59 PMSection III Chapter 35300 BACTERIOLOGY was first reported from an outbreak of cholera in Chennai in the year 1992, followed by similar outbreaks of cholera from different parts of India. The new strain entered Bangladesh and spread across the country, causing epidemics of cholera by January 1993. Key Points V. cholerae O139 The first noncholera Vibrio or noncholera strain that is associated with epidemics of cholera. Also responsible for producing disease in individuals previ-ously infected with V. cholerae O1 strains. Habitat V. cholerae is a salt water bacterium. Marine ecosystem in associ-ation with plankton is the primary habitat of the bacteria. The bacteria can multiply freely in the water. The number of bacte-ria in contaminated water increases during the warm and hot months of the year. V. cholerae is never found in normal humans. In infected humans, V. cholerae inhabits the small intestine. Reservoir, source, and transmission of the infection Humans and water are the two main reservoirs of infection for cholera. Both chronic and convalescent carriers play an impor-tant role as reservoirs in the transmission of infection. These chronic carriers continue to excrete vibrios in their stool inter-mittently for several years. Animals do not play any role in transmission of the disease. The infection is transmitted to humans by ingestion of con-taminated food or water. Hence, the infection rate is highest in the areas where community hygienic standards are low and potable water is not available. The infective dose of V. cholerae is usually high, more than 10 6 organisms/mL, because most organisms are killed by high acidity in the stomach. V. cholerae fails to survive in acidic environment. Therefore, any condi-tion (e.g., achlorhydria) that reduces production of gastric acid makes the person highly susceptible to infection. Transmission of infection by direct contact from person-to-person is rare. People of all ages are susceptible to infection by V. cholerae. Infants, however, are protected due to maternal antibodies transmitted during breast-feeding. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Fresh stool specimen collected before administration of anti-biotics is the specimen of choice. The stool may be collected by introducing a sterile soft rubber catheter (No: 24-26), or the liquid stool may be collected directly in a screw-capped container. Collection of stool from bed pan is not recom-mended due to the risk of contamination or the presence of disinfectants. Rectal swabs may also be used for collection of specimens. They are particularly useful in collecting stool specimens from convalescent patients who no longer excrete watery stool. Vomitus is not a useful specimen. The collected stool or rectal swab specimen should be sent to laboratory for immediate culture: If delay is anticipated, the specimens may be preserved at 4\u00b0C in a refrigerator or in transport media used for V. cholerae. The specimen may be transported in enrichment media, such as alkaline peptone water or Monsur's taurocho-late transport media and sent to laboratory for processing within few hours. In case of a longer delay in transport, the stool samples may be preserved in Cary-Blair medium or in VR fluid for long duration. In case of nonavailability of transport media, the watery stool can be soaked in a strip of thick blotting paper and sent to the laboratory\u2014packed in a plastic envelope. Microscopy Dark-field microscopy is a useful method for demonstrating characteristic motility of the bacilli and its inhibition by antisera. This is a rapid method of examination of stool collected from cases or after enrichment for 6 hours. Direct immunofluores-cence is another rapid method used for demonstration of vibrios in the stool. However, microscopic examination of a Gram-stained stool smear is not recommended for diagnosis of cholera. Culture The specimen collected in holding media is inoculated first in the enrichment media and incubated for 6-8 hours before being inoculated on nonse-lective media (BSA, MacConkey agar, and blood agar). The specimen may also be plated directly into these media before enrichment. The specimens collected in transport media are incubated for 6-8 hours including the transit time before inoculation into the suitable media. The inoculated plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. V. cholerae produces characteristic yellow colonies on TCBS and nonlactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar. Identification of bacteria Colonies on media are identified by performing a series of bio-chemical tests (Box 35-1). These include oxidase test (Fig. 35-5), utilization of amino acids, such as lysine, ornithine, and argi-nine (Color Photo 36); fermentation of hemo-lysis; chick cell agglutination; VP test; polyvalent antisera (Box 35-1).Serotyping: Suspected V. cholerae are tested agglutina- tion, using specific V. cholerae O1 antisera. In this test, the colo- nies are picked up with a straight wire and mixed with a drop of antisera on the slide. Agglutination of the bacteria shows that the test is positive for V. cholerae O1. If positive, agglutination of bacteria is repeated using Inaba and Ogawa sera for serotyping. and Ogawa sera. If agglutination is negative, the test 5/14/2012 3:09:59 PMSection III Chapter 35VIBRIO, AEROMONAS, AND PLESIOMONAS 301 with at least five more colonies, as both O1 and non-O1 vibrios may coexist in the same specimen.Biotyping: If the slide agglutination is positive and the colony is identified as V. cholerae O1, then it is tested by various tests to determine whether isolated V. cholerae O1 is Classical or Eltor. These tests include hemolysis of sheep RBCs, agglutination of chick RBCs, sensitivity to polymyxin B, VP test, and sensitivity to bacteriophages (Table 35-2). Vibrio colonies that are not agglutinated with cholerae O1 anti- sera are usually tested with antisera to the H antigen. Vibrio isolates that are agglutinated by H antisera but O139 by using specific antisera against O139 antigen. The isolated strains of V. cholerae O1 for phage typing may be sent to the international reference center for Vibrio phage typ-ing at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) at Kolkata, West Bengal. Diagnosis of carriers Repeated culture of stool is essential for isolation of V. cholerae from carriers because vibrios are known to be excreted intermit-tently in their stool. Collection of stool after using a purgative (such as mannitol or magnesium sulphate) or examination of bile collected by duodenal intubation are frequently useful for diagnosis of carriers. Serodiagnosis The complement-dependent vibriocidal antibody assay and antitoxin assay using live or killed vibrio suspensions are use-ful for demonstration of vibrio antibodies in the serum. These tests are useful for seroepidemiological studies, but are of little value in the diagnosis of cases. Treatment Treatment of cholera includes (a) replacement of fluid and electrolytes and (b) antibiotic therapy. Replacement of fluid and electrolytes Treatment of cholera is primarily based on prompt and adequate replacement of fluid and electrolytes, before the resultant mas-sive loss of fluid leads to hypovolemic shock. Replacement of fluid by oral administration of fluid containing glucose and elec-trolytes is the most successful and highly effective method for treatment of cholera. The oral rehydration therapy (ORT) solu-tion consisting of glucose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium citrate is widely used. The glucose facilitates absorp-tion of sodium in the small intestine, and salts present in the ORT restore the electrolyte balance and thereby reverse acidosis. The ORT is highly cost-effective and is simple to use; hence it is widely used with tremendous success in developing coun-tries endemic for cholera. Cereal-based preparation, such as thoroughly cooked and salted rice soup, is also equally effective for treatment of dehydration in cases of cholera. Immediate intravenous fluid therapy is usually recommended for more serious cases of dehydration. Antibiotic therapy Antibiotic therapy is of secondary importance and is a supple-ment to fluid therapy. Treatment with antibiotics diminishes the duration and volume of fluid loss. It also hastens clear-ance of the Vibrio organisms from the intestine. V. cholerae are uniformly sensitive to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and eryth-romycin. Tetracycline or doxycycline is the drug of choice for adults and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for children. Pyrazolidone is the usually recommended treatment for preg-nant females suffering from cholera. Of late, strains resistant to ciprofloxacin have been documented from Kolkata, India. Prevention and Control The preventive measures against cholera include general pre-ventive measures and cholera vaccination. FIG. smear shows typically comma-shaped Gram-negative bacilli with rounded or slightly pointed ends. 2. They sho w typical darting type motility. 3. The bacteria ferment sugars with production of acid only but no gas. They f erment glucose, sucrose, maltose, mannitol, and mannose. 4. The bacteria are positiv e for cholera red reaction, form indole, and reduce nitrates to nitrites. 5. The bacteria are catalase positive and oxidase positive. 6. Vibrio cholerae utilizes amino acids, such as lysine and ornithine, but does no t utilize arginine. vibrios agglutinable are vibrios. 9. V. cholerae O1 is identif ied as bio type Classical or Eltor depending on their biochemical reactions (Table 35-2).Box III Chapter 35302 BACTERIOLOGY General preventive measures These include early identification and case management, improved water supply and sanitation, improved personal hygiene, and health education. Vaccines Killed cholera vaccines: This is the traditional vaccine used against cholera. This vaccine is a suspension of 8000 million V. cholerae per mL, consisting of equal numbers of Inaba and Ogawa serotypes. This vaccine is given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly in two doses at an interval of 4 weeks. This vaccine confers about 60% protection for a short duration of 3-6 months. The rate of protection in endemic areas increases with age. A single dose of vaccine is not effective in children younger than 5 years but is effective in adults. In order to improve the antigenic stimulus, the number of organisms in the vaccine has been increased to 12,000 million/mL.Nonliving oral B subunit whole cell vaccine (WC/rBS vaccine): WC/rBS vaccine is a nonliving oral B subunit whole cell vaccine. It consists of heat-killed whole cell V. cholerae O1 (2.5 /H11003 10 10) in combination with the purified recombinant B subunit of cholera toxoid (WC/rBS). This vaccine is admin-istered in two doses at an interval of 1 week. This vaccine is currently available in Sweden and Latin America. Clinical tri-als carried out in Bangladesh, Peru, and Sweden have shown that vaccine is safe and confers 85-90% protection during 6 months in all age groups after administration of two doses.Live oral cholera vaccine (CVD 103-Hg R vaccine): CVD 103-Hg R vaccine is an oral cholera vaccine. It consists of an attenuated live oral genetically modified V. cholerae O1 strain (CVD 103-Hg R). This cholera vaccine developed by the Swiss Sera and Vaccine Institute is available in Europe, Latin America, and Canada. The vaccine is extremely immu-nogenic and highly protective against moderate and severe cases of cholera. The vaccines trials in adult volunteers in the United States have shown that a single dose confers high pro-tection (95%) against V. cholerae Classical and 65% protection against V. cholerae Eltor following a booster dose given after 3 months. Noncholera Vibrios V. cholerae serotypes V. cholerae vibrios that causes cholera as mentioned earlier. Noncholera vibrios other than V. cholerae O139 are widely found in the aquatic environments. In humans, they may cause mild to severe diar-rheal disease resembling cholera. Occasionally, they may also cause wound infections, septicemia, and other extraintestinal infections. Vibrio mimicus V. mimicus has been associated with many sporadic cases of diarrheal disease on the gulf coast of the United States. V. mimicus is so named because it resembles V. cholerae in its biochemical reactions. V. mimicus, unlike V. cholerae, does not ferment sucrose, but like V. cholerae it grows well at a 0.5-1% concentrated sodium chloride. Infection is acquired by eating seafood, especially oysters. The organisms cause a gastrointes-tinal disease, which is usually self-limited. Halophilic Vibrios Vibrios that require a higher concentration of sodium chloride are known as halophilic vibrios. They are natural inhabitants of sea water and marine life. V. parahaemolyticus , Vibrio alginolyticus, and V. vulnificus are three important halophilic vibrios species known to cause infection in humans. Vibrio parahaemolyticus V. parahaemolyticus is now recognized as an important cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis throughout the world. V. parahaemolyticus is a curved Gram-negative bacillus that resembles V. cholerae. However, it differs from V. cholerae by hav- ing a capsule showing bipolar staining and pleomorphism. It shows pleomorphism especially in cold cultures or when grown on 3% salt agar. Like other vibrios, it has polar flagella when grown in liquid culture, but shows peritrichous flagella when grown on solid media. It has simple nutritional requirement, but requires salt for growth. The organism fails to grow in the medium in the absence of sodium chloride. It can grow well in salt con-centration up to 8% and at an optimum salt concentration of 2-4%. On MacConkey agar, it produces colo-nies on TCBS agar are nonsucrose-fermenting green colonies with an opaque and raised center and translucent periphery. V. parahaemolyticus is oxidase, catalase, indole, and citrate positive. It reduces nitrates to It a ferments glucose, mannose, maltose, mannitol, and arabinose with pro-duction of acid only. It does not ferment sucrose, lactose, and salicin. It decarboxylates lysine and ornithine but not arginine. It is VP positive. V. parahaemolyticus is a heat-labile bacterium, readily destroyed at 60\u00b0C in 15 minutes. It is susceptible to drying, dis-tilled water, and vinegar in which it dies within a few minutes. The organism, however, can remain viable on freezing and refrigeration. V. parahaemolyticus contains three antigens: somatic O and capsular K antigen. Serotyping is based on O and K antigen. Thermostable direct hemolysin is the key virulence factor of V. parahaemolyticus. This virulence factor is found only in strains that are pathogenic to human beings. Strains isolated from humans possess this toxin, hence are pathogenic, while strains isolated from environment source, such as water, crabs, oysters, or fish do not possess this ther-mostable toxin, hence are nonpathogenic. Chap-35.indd PLESIOMONAS 303 Key Points Kanagawa phenomenon In this test, the pathogenic strains of V . parahaemolyticus when grown on a special high-salt mannitol agar) show hemolysis on is caused by a thermostable hemotoxin released by patho-genic strains, which are known as Kanagawa-positive strains. Nonpathogenic strains isolated from environment that do not cause any hemolysis on the blood agar are called Kanagawa-negative strains. V. parahaemolyticus is widely distributed in estuary and marine environments. Seafood, such as fish, crabs, or oysters, is the main source and reservoir of infection. The infection is acquired on consumption of contaminated seafood. V. parahaemolyticus in humans causes gastroenteritis. The severity of the condition can vary from mild self-limited diar-rhea to an acute illness. After an incubation period of 5-72 hours, the patients with gastroenteritis manifest as eosino-philic watery diarrhea. The condition is associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever, which may be present for 3 days. Stool usually does not contain any blood or mucus, but contains cellular exudates. The patient usually recovers within 3 days. V. parahaemolyticus also causes extraintestinal infections, such as wound infections and ear and eye infections in indi-viduals exposed to contaminated sea water. V. parahaemolyticus, although widely found in sea fish in some parts of India, is relatively less common in human infections. Vibrio alginolyticus V. alginolyticus is another halophilic vibrio. It shows a high salt tolerance and can grow even in the presence of 10% sodium chloride. On TCBS agar, it forms large yellow sucrose-ferment-ing colonies. It shows swarming on the surface of nonselective medium, such as blood agar. V. alginolyticus is widely distrib-uted in sea water and seafood. V. alginolyticus is associated with infections of superficial wounds exposed to contaminated sea water. It also has been associated with infections of the gastrointestinal tract, ear, and eye. Differentiating features of V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus are summarized in Table 35-5. Vibrio vulnificus V. a or Like V. is a Gram-negative bacillus and facultative anaerobe that requires salt for growth. It also produces green nonsucrose-fermenting colonies on TCBS medium. It differs from V. parahaemolyti-cus and other Vibrio species by its ability to ferment lactose. Relatively, V. vulnificus is a more virulent bacterium than V. parahaemolyticus. Presence of capsule and production of hydro-lytic enzymes, such as cytolysins, proteases, and collagenases are responsible for virulence of the bacteria. These organisms are also resistant to complement- and antibody-mediated lysis. V. vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of sea water. V. vulnificus infections are usually food-borne diseases and are largely asso-ciated with (a) ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood and (b) exposure of wound to contaminated sea water. V. vulnificus infection in humans produces two types of illness: (a) wound infection and (b) gastroenteritis rapidly progressing to septicemia. Wound infection caused by contam-inated sea water has a short incubation period of 3-24 hours. These wounds are usually present on the fingers, palms, or soles of the feet. The condition rapidly progresses to necrosis, gan-grene, or necrotizing fasciitis. The wound infection in patients with cirrhosis or malignancies may progress very rapidly with development of hemorrhagic bullae and extensive soft tissue necrosis. Gastroenteritis rapidly progressing to septicemia occurs following the consumption of raw seafood on exposure of broken skin to warm sea water after a short incubation period of 12-48 hours. The bacteria on ingestion penetrate the intestinal mucosa, but do not cause any gastrointesti-nal manifestations and enter blood stream rapidly, causing septicemia. The condition manifests as multiple hemor-rhagic bullae and extensive ecchymosis distributed mainly on the lower extremities. Patients frequently become hypo-tensive and develop oliguria and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. This condition is associated with mortality rate as high as 50%. Diagnosis of the condition is made by isolation of the bacte- ria from wounds and blood. Since V. vulnificus produces life-threatening illness, imme- diate and prompt treatment with antibiotics is essential. Tetracyclines or aminoglycosides are the antibiotics of choice for treatment of the condition. The condition is prevented by avoidance of raw and undercooked seafood. Other Vibrio Species Other Vibrio species associated associated with gastroenteri-tis, wound infections, and bacteremia. Rare infections of bac-teremia by Vibrio metschnikovii have also in fac-ultative anaerobic bacilli that morphologically resemble other members of the family Vibrionaceae. At least 16 species of Aeromonas have been described, of which 11 species are asso-ciated Gram-negative motile bacilli with the presence of polar flagella. Few strains are nonmotile. They are catalase positive, oxidase posi-tive, and nitrate positive. They ferment sugars with production of both acid and gas. They grow at an optimum temperature of 32\u00b0C and at a pH of 7. Aeromonas spp. are widely distributed in brackish water and in soil. Aeromonas species produce many virulence factors, such as enterotoxin, endotoxins, hemolysin, protease, siderophores, and adherence factors. However, the exact role of these virulence factors in the pathogenesis of illness is not known. Aeromonas spp. in humans cause gastroenteritis and wound infections. Gastroenteritis occurs following ingestion of contaminated food or water. The condition in adults manifests as chronic diarrhea, while in children it presents as acute and severe illness manifested by dysentery with presence of blood and mucus in the stool. Acute diarrhea is a self-limiting condition. Wound infection is caused by exposure of the broken skin to contaminated water. Aeromonas spp. also cause opportunis-tic skin diseases in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with malignancy or hepatobiliary disease. Aeromonas species are known to colonize intestinal tract of humans in approximately 3% of individuals. Therefore, isolation of the bacteria from stool by culture does not indi-cate disease by Aeromonas species. It needs careful interpreta- tion by taking into consideration clinical presentation of the illness. Aeromonas species are susceptible to chloramphenicol, gen- tamicin, and from genera and Vibrio of the family Vibrionaceae by some bio-chemical reactions (Table 35-6). Plesiomonas shigelloides is the only species described in the genus Plesiomonas. It is serologically related to Shigella sonnei and hence shows agglutination with S. sonnei antiserum. But it differs from Shigella by being oxidase positive and motile by the presence of polar flagella. P. shigelloides is motile and Gram-negative rod with rounded ends and measures 0.8-1 /H9262m. It is facultative anaerobe and grows well at The bacterium produces nonlactose color-less colonies on MacConkey agar and nonhemolytic colonies on blood agar. It does not grow on TCBS agar. The bacterium ferments inositol with production of acid only, but does not ferment sucrose or starch. The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh water and brackish water. The bacteria are frequently isolated from dogs, cats, goats, sheep, and other animals, such as frogs, snakes, turtles, and lizards. Humans acquire infection by ingestion of contami-nated seafood or contact with amphibians or reptiles. P. shigelloides in humans causes gastroenteritis. The condi- tion occurs after 48 hours of ingestion of the organism. The condition manifests as mild and watery diarrhea with absence of mucus or blood in the stool. This is a self-limiting disease. The bacteria are also associated with uncommon extraintes-tinal infections, such as cellulitis, septic arthritis, septicemia, neonatal meningitis, etc. P. shigelloides is resistant to ampicillin, to Plesiomonas based on utilization of amino acids TABLE 35-6 There was an outbreak of diarrhea during a major festival in which a large number of people participated. More than 20 people were admitted to the local hospital with history of severe watery diarrhea. Most of the patients were dehydrated. They were treated with fluid and electrolytes to maintain fluid balance. All the patients recovered. The stool was positive for Vibrio cholerae by culture, and the strain was found to be V. cholerae O1 by serotyping. What tests will you perform to know whether the isolated strain is Classical or Eltor? How does V. cholerae cause diarrhea? What are the vaccines available against cholera? What are the sources and reservoirs of cholera?CASE STUDY Chap-35.indd 304 5/14/2012 3:10:00 PM36 Introduction The of medical importance: Campylobacter and Helicobacter. The genera belonging to this family are Gram-negative, spiral bacilli with a low DNA guanosine and cytosine base rate. They are micro-aerophilic and grow only in the presence of a reduced oxygen concentration. They lack the capacity to oxidize or ferment sugars. Campylobacter Campylobacter infections are one of the most common bacte-rial infections in humans. They cause both diarrheal and other systemic diseases. The generic name Campylobacter is derived from the Greek word Kampylos meaning curved rod. The genus Campylobacter resembles the genus Vibrio in being motile by means of polar flagella and in being curved Gram-negative bacilli and oxidase positive. They, however, differ from vibrios (a) in being microaerophilic, (b) not fermenting carbohydrates and (c) having a lower guanosine and cytosine content of DNA. The genus Campylobacter consists of 18 species and subspecies, of which 11 species are known to cause infections in humans. These species cause both intestinal and extraintestinal dis-eases (Table 36-1). Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter fetus are the two most important species that cause most of the Campylobacter infections in humans. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Campylobacter shows following morphological features: Campylobacter are small, comma-shaped, Gram-negative rods. They vary in width from 0.2 to 0.5 /H9262m. They show a rapid darting motility in cork screw fashion by means of a single polar flagellum at one or both poles (monotrichous/amphitrichous). They are nonsporing bacteria. Culture Campylobacter spp. grow more slowly than other enteric bacteria. Campylobacter are microaerophilic, requiring an atmosphere and gastroenteritis lari Gastroenteritis and septicemia with decreased oxygen concentration (5%) and increased car-bon dioxide concentration (5-10%) for their growth. Most spe-cies jejuni, Campylobacter Campylobacter lari, and hence are called thermophilic bacilli. Selective media for Campylobacter species are blood-based and antibiotics-containing media, such as Skirrow's, Butzler, and Campy-BAP selective media. Campylobacter on these media produce well-formed colonies after 48 hours of incubation. C. jejuni produces moist, gray or colorless, flat, and non- hemolytic colonies on this medium. Other Campylobacter species produce circular and convex colonies. Biochemical reactions Campylobacter spp. show following reactions: Campylobacter are relatively biochemically inert. They do not produce indole. They are oxidase positive, catalase positive (C. jejuni subsp. doyle is an exception), and nitrate positive. C. jejuni is the only species that hydrolyzes sodium hippurate.TABLE 36-1Human caused by PMSection III Chapter 36306 Susceptibility physical and chemical agents: Campylobacter spp. survive at 4\u00b0C in Cary-Blair transport medium for many weeks. Campylobacter spp. are sensitive to hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and so conditions that decrease or neutralize gas-tric acid secretion reduce the amount of inoculum needed to cause disease. Pathogenesis and Immunity Campylobacter species are invasive bacteria. In humans, they cause primarily two types of infections: intestinal and extrain-testinal. The prototype species for intestinal infections is C. jejuni and for extraintestinal infections is C. fetus. Virulence factors C. jejuni possesses many virulence factors, such as enterotox-ins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), adhesins, and cytotoxic enzymes (Table 36-2). However, specific role of these virulence factors in the pathogenesis of disease is not well-known. Pathogenesis of disease caused by C. jejuni Human infection follows ingestion of 1000-10,000 bacteria, but the illness is infrequent with a dose of less than 10,000 bac-teria. Following three mechanisms have been postulated in the pathogenesis of intestinal disease caused by C. jejuni: 1. Adherence and production of heat-labile enterotoxins: C. jejuni adheres to the jejunum, ileum, and colon. Adherence to epithelial cells or mucus at these sites i s possibly facili- tated by flagella. LPS or other outer membrane compo-nents are also believed to contribute to adhesion. PEB1 is a superficial antigen that has been found to be a major adhesion protein, which is found among C. jejuni strains. Furthermore, C. jejuni enterotoxin is a heat-labile cholera- like enterotoxin, which is responsible for diarrhea observed during infections. 2. Invasion and proliferation of bacteria within the intes-tinal epithelium: C. jejuni causes characteristic histologic damage in the mucosal surface of the jejunum, ileum, and colon. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis. Infiltration of lamina propria occurs with neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and eosino-phils. It is also associated with crypt abscesses in the epi-thelial glands and ulceration of the mucosal epithelium. Precise role of enterotoxins and cytopathic toxins in causa-tion of intestinal pathology is not known. 3. Invasion of intestinal mucosa and proliferation: C. jejuni invades intestinal the lamina propria and mesenteric lym ph nodes. infections, such as cholecystitis, mesen-tery adenitis, urinary tract infection, and meningitis. C. jejuni infection in a small number of cases is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Pathogenesis of disease caused by C. fetus C. fetus is more frequently associated with systemic infections, such as bacteremia. A single protein, namely, S protein, found in C. fetus is the major virulence factor. It inhibits C3b binding responsible for both the serum and phagocytic resistance of the bacteria. Hence, it makes the bacteria resistant to the bacteri-cidal effects of serum. Host immunity Acute infection caused by C. jejuni confers immunity with devel- opment of specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody in the serum and also IgA antibodies in intestinal secretions. Both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are important in prevention and termination of C. jejuni infections. Clinical Syndrome Campylobacter spp. infections in humans can be broadly clas-sified into two major groups: (a) enteric infections and (b) extraintestinal infections. Enteric infections C. jejuni is the most important species associated with human enteric infections. Other Campylobacter species are also associ-ated with enteric infections; these are listed in Table 36-1. The clinical manifestations of enteric infections caused by all the Campylobacter species including C. jejuni are similar. Watery diarrhea is the main manifestation and occurs in approxi-mately 10% of children. The condition is also associated with abdominal pain, malaise, myalgia, headache, and vomiting. The condition is self-limiting. C. fetus may cause intermit- tent diarrhea and nonspecific abdominal pain. C. lari has also been reported to cause recurrent mild diarrhea in children. Campylobacter upsaliensis may also cause diarrhea. Extraintestinal infections Bacteremia: Bacteremia is the most important extraintestinal manifestation. Bacteremia caused by C. jejuni is uncommon Virulence factors Biological functions Enterotoxins Facilitate adherence to the jejunum, ileum, and colon Lipopolysaccharide Adhesion PEB1 Superficial antigen that has been found to be a major adhesion protein Adhesion proteins Adhesion Cytotoxic enzymes Cytotoxicity action S protein Found exclusively in Campylobacter fetus and is the major virulence factor.Inhibits C3b binding responsible for both the serum and phagocytic resistance of the Chapter HELICOBACTER 307 and occurs in patients with immunodeficiency, chronic disease, and in old individuals. Blood stream infections and bacteremia by C. fetus are rare. Perinatal infection: C. fetus is the most important Campylo- bacter species known to cause perinatal infection because of its affinity for the genital tract and due to its tropism for fetal tis-sue. Abortion, stillbirth, and premature labor are the common manifestations. Premature babies show signs and symptoms of sepsis. C. jejuni is rarely associated with perinatal infection. C. hyointestinalis causes occasional bacteremia in immunocom-promised syndrome, reactive arthritis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Reiter's syndrome are some of the noted complications associated with Campylobacter infection. Reactive arthritis is another condition seen in patients positive for HLA-B27 and is commonly seen in young patients. Guillain-Barre syndrome: It is an autoimmune disease believed to be due to molecular mimicry of terminal tetra-saccharide of LPS of C. jejuni and glycosphingolipid pres-ent on the surface of peripheral nerve. This is a disease of peripheral nerves and is characterized by ascending paraly-sis. A rare serotype of C. jejuni called Penner (LPS type O: 19) is associated with this condition. Epidemiology Campylobacter infections are extremely common worldwide. Geographical distribution The true incidence of Campylobacter infections is not known, because they are non-notifiable diseases. In the United States, an estimated 2 million cases of Campylobacter enteritis occur every year, which constitute 57% of cases of gastroenteritis. Average incidence of Campylobacter bacteremia in developed countries is estimated to be 1.5/1000 patients with enteritis. In developing countries, although exact figures are not available, C. jejuni is frequently isolated from stool of healthy children during 5 years of life. Isolation rates in children ranges from 8% to 45% with an annual incidence as high as 2.1 episodes of Campylobacter-associated diarrhea per child. Habitat In infected humans, C. jejuni inhabits the duodenum, jejunum, and colon. C. fetus inhabits the genital tract of infected mothers. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Campylobacter infections are zoonotic. Infected animals are the main reservoir of the infection. The animal reservoirs are the dogs, cats, and other pets that carry the organism in their gastrointestinal tract. Infected animal food products are the source of infection. Transmission of C. jejuni to humans occurs by the following methods: 1. Transmission occurs most commonly from infected ani-mals and their food products. Most human inf ections occur by ingestion of contaminated and improperly cooked poultry meat products. Infected chickens may account for 50-70% of the infection. The infection also occurs by drinking contaminated raw milk or unpasteurized milk. 2. The infection may also be transmitted from infected ani-mals and humans by feco-oral route on ingestion of f ood and water contaminated with human or animal feces. 3. The infection may be transmitted from person to person by sexual contact. Cam pylobacter infection occurs in all age groups. In developing countries, Campylobacter enteritis is very common in children younger than 5 years. In contrast, Campylobacter bacteremia occurs in patients older than 65 years. Campylobacter enteritis is much frequently seen in (a) individuals handling cattle, sheep, and other farm animals, (b) homosexual men, and (c) labora-tory workers. Campylobacter bacteremia is seen in (a) persons with immunocompromised state (hypogammaglobulinemia, HIV infection, malignancies, etc.), (b) persons with diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, and (c) pregnant ladies. Laboratory Diagnosis The diagnosis of Campylobacter infection is confirmed by dem-onstrating the bacteria by direct examination of feces or isola-tion of the bacteria by culture. Specimens Diarrheic fresh stool is the specimen of choice for enteric infec-tions. Rectal swab may also be used. Other specimens include blood, body fluids, and tissues for diagnosis of extraintestinal infections. In case of delay, feces or rectal swab are transported in Cary-Blair transport medium. Campylobacter spp. survive for 1-2 weeks at 4\u00b0C in this medium. Microscopy Presumptive diagnosis is made by examination of wet mount of stool by dark-field microscopy or phase contrast microscopy. The bacteria are identified by their characteristic darting motil-ity. Gram staining of the stool shows typical Gram-negative, curved rods with a sensitivity of 50-75%. Fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes can also be detected in Gram-stained smear of the stool in approximately 75% patients with Campylobacter enteritis. Culture Definitive diagnosis of Campylobacter enteric infection is best done on isolation of the organism by stool culture. Culture of C. jejuni from stool requires special selective media\u2014 Butzler medium, Preston's Campylobacter selective medium, and Blaser's medium (Campy-BAP). The selective media contain antibiotics that inhibit growth of the other fecal bacteria. Fresh stool specimens collected within 24 hours are inoculated directly on their media. But old stool specimens are first enriched in an enrichment medium, such as Preston campylobacter enrichment broth for at least 24 hours at 4\u00b0C (cold enrichment) before inoculating on the selective media. 5/14/2012 CO2 at 42\u00b0C for 48 hours. If C. fetus or other unusual Campylobacter species are suspected, stool specimens are inoculated on media with-out antibiotics and are incubated at 37\u00b0C. Other extraintesti-nal specimens, such as blood, body fluids, and tissue, can be inoculated on routine media for isolation of Campylobacter species. Identification of bacteria Preliminary identification of colonies is made by typical Gram-staining features, darting motility, and oxidase test. Definitive identification is made by biochemical tests (Box 36-1). Histology Examination by sigmoidoscopy shows widening or proctoco-litis in up to 80% of patients with Campylobacter enteritis. The histopathological with crypt abscess formation. Serodiagnosis ELISA is available for demonstration of specific antibodies in the serum, and a high titer of antibodies is usually seen after the symptoms are resolved. Serology may not be useful for rou-tine diagnosis, but is useful for epidemiological studies. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probes and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) are used for detection of enteric Campylobacter infection. These tests, however, continue to be research tools and are not routinely used. Treatment Most C. jejuni infections are mild and self-limited. Therefore, they do not require antibiotic therapy. Supportive treatment is adequate. Treatment with antibiotics is recommended only for persons: with fever, bloody diarrhea, or with symptoms persisting for more than 7 days, and for immunocompromised host.Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice. Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline are the alternative antibiotics, but are not recom-mended for use in young children. Recently, reports of eryth-romycin and ciprofloxacin resistant strains have increasingly been documented from many parts of the world. Prevention and Control Thorough cooking of all poultry products and strict personal hygiene (such as washing hands with soap before and after han-dling raw foods of animal origin) are some of the measures for preventing Campylobacter infections. Helicobacter Helicobacter are Campylobacter -like bacteria with a spiral or heli- cal morphology. are motile by means of sheathed flagella. Helicobacter spp. inhabit stomach of humans and many other mammals, such as monkeys, dogs, cats, ferrets, mice, etc. The genus Helicobacter consists of many species, which are associ- ated with human diseases (Table cinaedi , and Helicobacter species that cause human infections. Helicobacter pylori The association of H. pylori type (MALT), and B-cell lymphoma is recognized worldwide. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology H. pylori shows following morphological features: H. pylori is curved, spiral, or S-shaped bacil-lus measuring 3 /H9262m in length and 0.5-0.9 /H9262m in breadth. The organism is highly motile and shows cork screw motility due to presence of a unipolar tuft of lophotrichous It is nonsporing. 1. Gram-stained typical rods. 2. Shows characteristic darting motility. 3. Campylobacter jejuni produce moist, gra y or colorless, f lat, and nonhemolytic colonies on Skirrow's, Butzler, and Campy-BAP selective media. 4. Biochemically inert; they do not produce indole. 5. Nitrate positive. 6. C. jejuni is the only species that h ydrolyzes sodium hippurate. 7. Oxidase positive and catalase III HELICOBACTER 309 Culture H. pylori is microaerophilic and grows in the presence of decreased oxygen concentration (5%) and increased carbon dioxide concentration (10%) in a temperature range between 30 and 37\u00b0C. The bacteria do not grow anaerobically, grow poorly at 42\u00b0C, and do not grow at all at 25\u00b0C. H. pylori grows well on freshly prepared chocolate agar and Skirrow's campylobacter media. H. pylori produces circular, convex, and translucent col- onies on these media, after incubation of 3-5 days. reactions H. pylori reactions: H. pylori produces the enzyme urease, which is almost 100 times more active than that produced by Proteus vulgaris . Urease production is the most important feature of H. pylori. H. pylori is catalase and oxidase positive. These are biochemically inactive and do not ferment or oxi-dize sugars, although they can metabolize amino acids by fermentative pathways. Pathogenesis and Immunity H. pylori characteristically cause (a ) alteration of gastric acid production, (b ) gastric inflammation, and (c ) tissue destruction. Virulence factors H. pylori produces several virulence factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of disease (Table 36-4).1. Urease: The enzyme urease is a very important factor for colonization of H. pylori in the gastric mucosa. The enzyme pro-duces ammonia from urea, which in turn increases the pH of the gastric mucosa in the immediate vicinity of the bacterial cell. It helps, therefore, to neutralize gastric acidity and also in colonization of the organism in gastric mucosa. The enzyme also stimulates cytokines.2. Flagella: Flagella are also very important for colonization of H. pylori. These help the organism to penetrate into gastric mucous layer; hence, it is protected from acidic environment stomach.3. Adhesins: These include hemagglutinin, sialic acid-binding adhesins, and Lewis blood group adhesins. All these factors facilitate binding of H. pylori to gastric mucosa.4. Enzymes: H. pylori superoxide dismutase, and catalase. gastric mucus, while superoxide dismutase and catalase prevent phagocytic killing of the bacteria.5. Heat shock protein (Hsp-B): The heat shock protein facili- tates expression of the urease.6. Acid protein causes acid from parietal cells.7. Cytotoxin: This causes vacuolation in epithelial cells of the host. Pathogenesis of H. pylori infection H. pylori infection begins by colonization of gastric mucosa, which is facilitated by many virulence factors. H. pylori blocks the production of acid by its acid-inhibitory protein and also neutralizes the gastric acidity by production of ammo-nia by splitting urea by the enzyme urease. The biological activity of urease is enhanced further by heat shock proteins. Subsequently, Helicobacter through their active cork screw motility pass through gastric mucosa and adhere to epithelial cells. The adhesion is mediated by many adhesin proteins, such as hemagglutinin, sialic acid-binding adhesin, and Lewis blood group adhesin. H. pylori are protected from phagocytosis and intracellular killing by enzymes, such as elastases and superox-ide dismutase. After adhesion, damage to the epithelial cells is caused by multiple factors, such as mucinases, phospholipases, and vacuolating aflatoxin and by products of urease. Finally, Helicobacter infection causes atrophic and even metaplastic changes in the stomach. Virulence factors Biological functions Urease Helps in colonization of the organism in gastric mucosa; the enzyme also stimulates production of cytokines Flagella It helps the organism to penetrate into gastric mucous layer, hence protects the bacteria from acid environment of the stomach Adhesins Facilitate binding of H. pylori to gastric mucosa Enzymes Both mucinase and phospholipase break down gastric mucus, while superoxide dismutase and catalase prevent phagocytic killing of the bacteria Heat shock protein (Hsp-B) The protein facilitates expression of the enzyme urease Acid inhibitory protein The protein causes hypochlorhydria by blocking secretions of acid from parietal cells Cytotoxin This causes vacuolation in epithelial cells of the host Vacuolating toxin (VacA) Causes vacuolation along with cytotoxin-associated gene protein III Chapter 36310 BACTERIOLOGY Host immunity H. pylori infection induces the production of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies and also cellular immunity, but they do not appear to confer any protection against the disease. Clinical Syndrome H. pylori in humans causes (a) peptic ulcer disease and (b) chronic atrophic gastritis. Peptic ulcer disease H. pylori is now accepted to be the infective pathogen that causes most of the gastric and duodenal ulcers. Treatment of H. pylori infection by specific antibiotics, and thereby the elimi-nation of organism from the stomach, results in healing of these ulcers and in marked reduction in the recurrence of ulcers. Chronic atrophic gastritis H. pylori infection causes chronic atrophic gastritis during later stage of the illness. Key Points Chronic gastritis is now being recognized as a risk factor for many gastric malignancies: Gastric adenocarcinoma \u2014the most important complication of H. pylori infection; Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid type (MALT) lympho-mas\u2014this condition shows a better prognosis than gastric adenocarcinoma and is found to regress after elimination of H. pylori by treatment; and Squamous cell esopharyngeal cancer. Epidemiology H. pylori is ubiquitous, found worldwide. H. pylori infection occurs more frequently in developing countries than in the developed countries. Geographical distribution More than 50% of the people are infected worldwide, but the actual incidence of H. pylori infection is unknown because exact data are not available from developing countries. Habitat H. pylori colonize gastric mucosa of healthy persons as well as the persons suffering from peptic ulcer diseases. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the primary reservoirs of infection. The prevalence rate of H. pylori infection may differ based on geographical area and race. The prevalence rate is approximately 60% in Hispanic persons, 54% in African American persons, and 20% in White persons. Poor hygiene, overcrowding, and poverty facilitate transmission. The most likely route of H. pylori infection is either fecal-to-oral infection (from stool to mouth) or oral-to-oral (stomach contents transmitted from mouth to mouth) contact. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include stool samples and gastric biopsy specimen. Microscopy H. pylori is demonstrated by microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimen stained with Gram, Giemsa, Warthin Starry silver, and hematoxylin-eosin stains. All these stains show organisms of H. pylori adhered to gastric mucosa. These meth- ods are highly specific. Culture Diagnosis of H. pylori infection is made by culture of clinical specimens on freshly prepared chocolate agar and Skirrow's campylobacter selective media followed by incubation at in environment 3-5 days. H. pylori produces convex, circular, and large colonies on these selective media. Identification of bacteria Identification of bacterial isolates is made on the basis of typi-cal growth characteristics of H. pylori on selective medium; morphology; and oxidase, catalase, and urease test (Box 36-2). Serology ELISA is used for demonstration of serum antibodies to H. pylori in the patient serum. But since the antibody titers con-tinue to remain elevated a long time after H. pylori eradication, antibody-based test cannot distinguish between recent and old infection. ELISA shows a high sensitivity and specificity. Fecal antigen test This is an immunochromatographic test, which uses monoclo-nal antibody for direct detection of H. pylori antigen in stool samples. This test is very sensitive (94%) and specific (98%). 1. Stained smear shows typical curved, spiral, or S-shaped Gram-negative bacillus. 2. Shows characteristic cork screw motility. 3. produce cir cular , and Skirrow's campylo-bacter media. 4. Biochemically inert; does not ferment or oxidize sugars. 5. H. pylori produce the enzyme urease, which is almost 100 times more activ e that produced by Proteus vulgaris . Urease produc- tion is the most important H. pylori. 6. Oxidase positive and catalase positive.Box 311 Urease test The urease test is the most rapid test, which can be dem-onstrated directly in the biopsy specimen. In this test, the biopsy tissues are put in a urease indicator medium (0.5 mL urea solution with an indicator) and incubated at 37\u00b0C. If H. pylori is present, the color of the medium changes due to change of pH of the medium within a few minutes to 2 hours due to the production of ammonia. The test is highly spe-cific (100%), but sensitivity varies from 75% to 95% (Fig. 36-1, Color Photo 37). Rapid urea breath test This test is based on detection of the products of urea degraded by H. pylori. In this method, patients drink a beverage that con- tains urea labeled with a carbon isotope, such as carbon 13 or carbon 14. After a short period of time, the concentration of labeled carbon is measured in the breath. The concentration is high only when urease present in H. pylori found in the stomach breaks down the urea. In normal human host, the concentra-tion of the labeled carbon in breath would not be high because the human stomach does not contain any urease. Positive urea breath test indicates H. pylori infection. The breath test is a very selective test. Disadvantages of the test are that it may show false positive results in: infections with coccoid forms of H. pylori that do not pro-duce more urease enzymes and patients receiving antibiotics, such as bismuth and hista-mine-2 blockers. Treatment H. pylori is sensitive to several antibiotics and to bismuth salts. Use of a single antibiotic or an antibiotic contained with bis-muth is not effective. More success has been achieved for treatment of gastric or peptic ulcer by using a combination of bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole), and one or more antibiotics (ampicillin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline). The combination of three types of drug is known as triple therapy and is usually given for either 10 or 14 days. Recently, H. pylori strains resistant to macrolides have been reported. Also, some strains resistant to clarithromycin have been documented in children. Prevention and Control Improved personal hygiene is important in prevention of the disease. Other Helicobacter Species H. fennelliae (formerly known as Campylobacter fennelliae) and H. cinaedi (formerly known as Campylobacter cinaedi) have been isolated from homosexual men with concurrent HIV and tuberculosis infection suffering from proctitis, proc-tocolitis, or enteritis. Helicobacter-like organisms have been described in the last decade. Helicobacter mustelae was first described in ferrets and subsequently, Helicobacter hepaticus has been detected in Syrian hamsters by using specific PCR tests. These Helicobacter-like organisms do not cause any infec- tion in humans but are suggested as useful animal model for studying H. pylori infections. Differences between important Campylobacter and Helicobacter species are summarized in Table biochemical properties of important Campylobacter and Helicobacter species Urease test Urease test FIG. 5-year-old child attended OPD of a hospital with his mother complaining of diarrhea associated with abdominal cramp for the last 2 days.

Most of them are motile by presence of one or two flagella. They are ubiquitous bacteria, primarily saprophytic, and are found in soil, water, and in other moist environment. All these bacteria belong to family Pseudomonadaceae, which contains over 200 species. Most of them are pathogenic to plants, insects, and reptiles. A few species cause disease in humans. These are ubiquitous and are found worldwide. They are found in soil, vegetations, water, plants, and animals with a predilection to moist environments. They are also commonly found in hospital environment. They are opportunistic patho-gens often causing hospital or nosocomial infections. These organisms are notorious because of the potency to develop innate resistance to many antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa is the most important species associated with human infection. It is a most common human saprophyte, but it rarely causes disease in healthy individuals. P. aeruginosa causes most of human infections in immunocompromised human host. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology P. aeruginosa shows the following morphological features: P. aeruginosa is a straight or slightly curved, Gram-negative bacillus measuring 0.5-1.0 /H11003 1.5-5.0 /H9262m in size arranged singly, in pairs, or in short chains. It is motile by the presence of a polar flagellum. Occasion-ally, strains may possess two or three polar flagella. Pseudomonas spp. is noncapsulated. Although the bacteria are noncapsulated, many strains appear mucoid by production of an abundant of extracellular polysaccharide composed of Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Moraxella Bacteria Diseases Pseudomonas aeruginosa Respiratory tract infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, ear infections, eye infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis fluorescence Opportunistic infections infections and urinary tract infections Burkholderia cepacia Opportunistic respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease and urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters Burkholderia mallei Acute or chronic infection with infection localized to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or respiratory tract Burkholderia pseudomallei Melioidosis Moraxella catarrhalis Bronchitis and bronchopneumonia seen in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and in elderly patientsTABLE 37-1 Human infections caused by Pseudomonas and other the family This slime layer forms a loose capsule or glycocalyx around the bacillus. These strains are particularly isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas spp. is nonsporing and are strictly aerobic bacteria. P. aeruginosa grows over a wide range of temperatures (5-32\u00b0C), the optimum tem-perature being 37\u00b0C. P. aeruginosa grows on commonly used routine at nutrient agar produces large (2-3 mm in diam-eter), opaque, translucent, and irregularly round colonies. These colonies emit a characteristic musty to fruity odor due to production of aminoacetophenone from the amino acid tryptophan. It produces hemolytic colonies on blood agar. 2. MacConkey The organism trimide agar is a medium of P. aeruginosa. 4. Nutrient broth: In nutrient broth, it produces a dense turbidity with sur face pellicle. P. aeruginosa produces different types of pigments, such as ( a) pyocyanin, (b) pyoverdin, ( c) pyorubin, and (d) However, some strains of Pseudomonas are not pigmented. Pyocyanin is specifically produced by P. aeruginosa, which diffuses into the surrounding medium (Fig. 37-1). The pigment is soluble in chloroform and water. Pyoverdin, or fluorescein, is produced by P. aeruginosa as well as by many other Pseudomonas species. These pigments give a yellow tinge to the colonies of bacteria and are best demonstrated in microscope using ultravi-olet source of light. Fluorescein is soluble in water, but insoluble in chloroform. Pyorubin is a red pigment, which is soluble in water but insoluble in alcohol. Pyomelanin is a brown pigment. Biochemical reactions They are oxidase positive. Oxidase test is an important test for identification of P. aeruginosa. All the strains are oxidase positive within 30 seconds of performing the test. They are nonfermentative bacteria. They utilize sugars by an oxidase metabolism, with oxygen as the termi-nal electron acceptor. Special media, such as oxidation- fermentation (OF) media, are used to demonstrate the low quantity of acid produced during oxidative breakdown of sugars. P. aeruginosa utilizes glucose, forming acid only (Color Photo 38). They do not utilize lactose and maltose. They reduce nitrates to nitrite, which is further broken down to gaseous nitrogens. They are catalase positive. They are arginine dihydrolase positive. They are indole, MR, VP, and H2S negative. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemicals agents: P. aeruginosa is heat-labile bacterium, readily killed at 55\u00b0C in 1 hour. It is also highly susceptible to acid, silver salts, 2% alkaline, glutaralde-hyde, and disinfectants (such as Dettol and cetrimide). However, P. aeruginosa is very strongly resistant to common antiseptics and disinfectants, such as chloroxylenol, hexachlorophene, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure These include pili, slime layer capsule, lipopolysaccharide, and pyocyanin as described in Table 37-2.Pili: Pili of P. aeruginosa are similar to those present in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. They are important in mediating adhesion of the bacteria to the epithelial cells.Slime layer: P. aeruginosa cell wall is surrounded by loose slime layer. The loose slime layer, also known as alginate coat or glycocalyx, protects the bacteria from phagocytosis and against activity of many antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides. The production of the mucoid slime layer is mediated by genes. These genes are activated in patients suffering from chronic respiratory disease or in those with cystic fibrosis and when colonized.Lipopolysaccharide: The cell wall of P. aeruginosa like that of other Gram-negative bacteria contains LPS. The LPS are endo-toxins, which constitute a major component of the cell wall and contribute to the sepsis caused by the bacteria.Pyocyanin: Pyocyanin is a pigment that catalyzes the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, and causes tissue damage. This pigment also contributes to inflammation associated with the disease. FIG. 37-1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa aeruginosa consists O and H antigens.O Somatic antigens are possesses 19 distinct group-specific O anti- gens, on the basis of which the organism has been classified into 19 serogroups. O antigens are heat stable and can be extracted with acid or formamide. The O antigen can be detected by pre-cipitation reaction-in-gel or by tube or slide agglutination tests using specific antisera produced against these antigens. Some of the O antigens, such as serogroup aeruginosa serogroups O6 and O11 isolated from majority of the clinical specimens. Serogroup O11 has been associated with most of the hospital-acquired infection caused by P. aeruginosa.H antigen: Flagella or H antigens are found in the flagella of P. aeruginosa. These antigens are heat labile. Two types of H antigens have been demonstrated by slide agglutination tests by using specific antibodies against these antigens. Pathogenesis and Immunity P. aeruginosa is an invasive pathogen. Virulence factors P. aeruginosa invasion is mediated by many virulence fac-tors including toxins, enzymes, and structure of the cell wall (Table 37-2) as follows: 1. Toxins: These include exotoxin A, Enzymes: Elastase, and rhamnolipid. 3. Cell loose slime la yer, LPS, and pyocyanin. Toxins Exotoxin A : Exotoxin A is one of the most important virulence factor produced by P. aeruginosa. The toxin like that of the diphtheria toxin acts by preventing synthesis of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Exotoxin A, however, differs from exotoxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae immunologically and structurally. Exotoxin A is less potent than diphtheria toxin. Exotoxin A is responsible for causing tissue damage in chronic pulmonary infection, dermatonecrosis in burns wound, and destruction of cornea in ocular infection. The toxin also causes suppression of immunity in the infected host.Exotoxins S and T : Exotoxins S and T are the toxins produced by P. aeruginosa. These toxins show adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity. These toxins are believed to facilitate spread of bacteria and invasion of tissues followed by necrosis by causing damage in the epithelial cells. Enzymes Elastase: The enzyme elastase is and zinc metalloprotease (LasB). These two enzymes act in combination to destroy elastin present in elastin-containing tissues. These enzymes cause damage in parenchymal tissues of the lung and produce hemorrhagic lesions associated with spreading P. aeruginosa infections. These enzymes also facilitate Virulence factors Biological functions ToxinsExotoxin A Acts by prevention of synthesis of proteins in eukaryotic cells; causes tissue damage in chronic pulmonary infection, dermatonecrosis in burns wound, and destruction of cornea in ocular infection; causes immunosuppression Exoenzymes adenosine diphosphate transferase activity, inhibit protein cause immunosuppression EnzymesElastase Destroys elastin present in elastin-containing tissues (skin, lung tissue, blood vessels, etc.), immunoglobulins, and complement factors Alkaline protease Tissue destruction, inactivation of interferon Phospholipase C Causes tissue destruction by breaking down lipids and lecithin Rhamnolipid Breaks down lecithin-containing tissues Cell wall componentsPili Adhesion of the bacteria to the epithelial cells Capsule Inhibits antibiotics killing of the bacteria Lipopolysaccharide Endotoxic activity, sepsis Pyocyanin Causes tissue damage, inflammation III Chapter 37316 BACTERIOLOGY spread of infection and damage of tissues in acute infections by degrading several components of the complement and also by inhibiting chemotaxis activities of neutrophils. Chronic P. aeruginosa infection is associated with development of antibodies to both the enzymes, LasA and LasB, and deposition of immune complexes in the infected tissues.Alkaline protease: Alkaline protease is also responsible for destruction of tissue and dissemination of P. aeruginosa infection. The enzyme also interferes with immune response of the host.Phospholipase C: Phospholipase C is a heat-labile hemolysin. It contributes to tissue destruction by breaking down lipids and lecithin.Rhamnolipid: Rhamnolipid is a heat-stable hemolysin. It also contributes to breaking down of lecithin-containing tissues. Cell wall These include pili, loose slime layer, LPS, and pyocyanin as described earlier (Table 37-2). Clinical Syndromes P. aeruginosa are opportunistic pathogens as well as true pathogens. P. aeruginosa as true pathogen cause infections of the respiratory tract in patients with underlying disease of the respiratory tract. They also cause infection of urinary tract in patients with catheterization. P. aeruginosa as opportunistic pathogens causes most of human infections in immunocom-promised host. P. aeruginosa causes a wide variety of clinical syn-dromes as follows: Respiratory tract infections P. aeruginosa infection of the lower respiratory tract occurs almost exclusively in patients with malignancies and immuno-deficiencies. Primary nonbacteremic Pseudomonas pneumonia usually occurs in patients who have been colonized earlier with P. aeruginosa. This colonization is seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, other chronic disease, and in those with neutrope-nia. The condition manifests typically as a bilateral, diffuse bronchopneumonia often associated with pleural effusion. The condition is associated with a high mortality rate of 70%. The conditions that increase susceptibility of these patients to infection with P. aeruginosa include: Use of respiratory instruments during therapy, which may introduce these bacteria to the lower respiratory tract. Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that inhibit normal microbial flora of the respiratory tract. Skin infections P. aeruginosa can cause a variety of skin infections, such as infections of burn wound, chronic paronychia, infected toe web, pseudomonal folliculitis, and pseudomonal cellulitis. Infection of burn wounds is the most common recognized con-dition caused by P. aeruginosa. Pseudomonal wound infection is characterized by the presence of dark brown eschar associated with edema and hemorrhagic necrosis. Pseudomonas skin infections are commonly seen in patients who are exposed to moisture. Pseudomonal toe web infection is seen more commonly in children than in adults who are exposed to contaminated water in swimming pools, hot tubs, etc. P. aeruginosa causes paronychia (i.e., infection of the nail) in individuals whose hands are more exposed to water. Urinary tract infections P. aeruginosa causes urinary tract infections in persons with indwelling urinary catheters and in persons undergoing instru-mentation and surgery of urinary tract. These infections usu-ally are hospital acquired and iatrogenic. Ear infections P. aeruginosa is one of the common agents causing external otitis in patients with history of swimming. The species is also respon-sible for causing malignant external otitis, a virulent form of dis-ease that occurs primarily in patients with diabetes or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in elderly patients. Eye infections P. aeruginosa causes pseudomonal endophthalmitis. The condi-tion may occur following trauma, intraocular surgery, or poste-rior perforation of corneal ulcer. Persons wearing contact lens are at increased risk of developing pseudomonal infection. Endocarditis Cardiovascular infections, such as pseudomonal infectious endocarditis, are caused by involvement of both normal and abnormal valves (tricuspid, aortic, and mitral valve) on both sides of the heart. This condition leads to destruction of heart valves and subsequent heart failure. This condition is most commonly seen in patients who are intravenous drug abusers of pentazocine and triphenylamine. Nosocomial infections Most infections caused by P. aeruginosa are opportunistic infec- tions seen in immunocompromised host. Such immunocom-promised hosts include: Persons with dysfunctional immune mechanisms, such as those occurring in AIDS, cystic fibrosis, neonates, comple-ment deficiency, hypogammaglobulemia, and neutropenia. Patients with injury to the skin and mucocutaneous mem-brane that occurs during burn injuries and during use of urinary catheters, dialysis catheters, endotracheal tubes, and intravenous lines. P. aeruginosa causes bacteremia\u2014a condition clinically similar to Gram-negative bacteremia in immunocompromised patients. It also causes pseudomonal meningitis, which occurs in patients who are immunocompromised or have undergone neurosurgery. Chap-37.indd P. aeruginosa are the opportunistic pathogens, causing infec-tion, distributed worldwide. Geographical distribution P. aeruginosa infection is ubiquitous in most environmental places in the hospital. The bacteria are specially found in the hospital environment, such as toilet, bath tubs, wash basins, respiratory and dialysis equipments, kitchens, and even in anti-septic or disinfectant solutions. Habitat P. aeruginosa is a common human saprophyte present widely in the environment. In hospitalized patients, P. aeruginosa tran-siently colonizes the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of the patients. The colonization is common in patients, partic-ularly those hospitalized for a very long period, treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics over a long duration, and those exposed to respiratory therapy by instrumentation. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Hospital environment is the most common source and res-ervoir of infection. Pseudomonal infections are transmitted through aerosols and by contact with infectious materials. P. aeruginosa is responsible for nearly 5-15% of hospital or noso-comial infections. Pyocin typing Typing of P. aeruginosa based on the production of pyocin is the most commonly used method for typing P. aeruginosa strains. These are used in epidemiology studies. Pyocins are bacterio-cins produced by P. aeruginosa. Three types of pyocins are pro- duced. They are R, F, and S pyocins. The capability to produce these pyocins is observed in more than 90% of strains of P. aeruginosa. Those strains that produce pyocins are resistant to their own pyocins, but are sensitive to those produced by other strains. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of pseudomonal infection is based on isolation of P. aeruginosa from feces or other clinical speci-mens containing mixed microbial flora by culture on selective medium, such as cetrimide agar. Since P. aeruginosa is frequently present as a contaminant in the clinical specimen, hence not a single isolation but repeated isolations are essential to confirm P. aeruginosa as the causative agent of condition. Identification of bacteria Nonlactose-fermenting and beta-hemolytic green pigmented colonies (Color Photo 39), which are rapid oxidase positive, are identified by biochemical properties, production of pyocins, and susceptibility to phage typing, serotyping, and molecular typing (Box 37-1).Treatment Treatment of Pseudomonas infection is by specific antimi-crobial therapy. However, P. aeruginosa shows a considerable degree of resistance to many of the commonly used antibiotics. Pseudomonas are susceptible ticarcillin. Ciprofloxacin is most frequently used antibiotic, because it is active against P. aeruginosa in most tissues. Pseudomonas infec-tions are treated best with combination of at least two antip-seudomonal antibiotics. A combination of aminoglycosides or quinolone with another antipseudomonal antibiotic is effec-tive for most of the Pseudomonas infections. Treatment with a combination of two antibiotics is usually not recommended for single urinary tract infection, local skin infection, or in febrile leukopenic patients. Key Points Antimicrobial therapy of P. aeruginosa infection is frequently problematic due to the following reasons: Most strains are intrinsically resistant to most commonly used antimicrobial agents. They can become more resistant during therapy with antibiotics. The mutation of the genes encoding for outer membrane porin proteins is most com-monly responsible for development of resistance. They also produce many beta-lactamases, which cause inactivation of many beta-lactam antibiotics such as peni-cillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, etc. Treatment with hyperimmune globulin and granulocytic trans-fusion may be useful. Treatment of underlying diseases and appropriate supportive therapy is also crucial for treatment of pseudomonal infections. Prevention and Control Prevention of Pseudomonas infections, particularly in hospitals, is always difficult. It requires constant monitoring and strict attention to asepsis. The measures suggested for hospital infec-tion control practices are based on: 1. Prevention of cross-infection of patients by attending med-ical and paramedical personnel. 2. Prevention of contamination of equipments, such as dialy-sis machine and respiratory instruments and restricting the use of broad-spectrum antibio tics. The latter suppresses pigmented on blood agar 4. Motile. 5. flora facilitates the overgrowth of resistant Pseudomonas organisms. 3. Pseudomonas vaccines hav e been evaluated in specialized situation, such as cases of cystic fibrosis that are highly susceptible to Pseudomonas infections. Other Pseudomonas Species P. stutzeri, P. putida, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and P. fluorescence are also associated with opportunistic infections in humans. P. stutzeri is associated with occasional urinary tract infection. It is a motile bacterium with single polar flagellum, which pro-duces light brown pigmented colonies in culture, and the pig-ment does not diffuse into the medium. Burkholderia The genus Burkholderia includes four species, which were formerly classified as Pseudomonas species. These include Burkholderia are human pathogens, B. and B. mallei are not. Burkholderia cepacia B. cepacia, previously known as Pseudomonas cepacia, was first described by Walter Burkholder in 1949. It is the causative agent for bacterial rots in onions. The bacteria were first reported as the causative agent of endocarditis in 1950s. Subsequently, the bacteria are being increasingly reported to be associated with urinary tract infections, catheter-associated bacteremias, and wound infections in humans. B. cepacia is a Gram-negative, motile bacillus and stains irreg- ularly with Gram staining. It is an aerobe, on nutri-ent agar at 25-30\u00b0C. On nutrient agar, the bacteria produce nondiffusible reddish purple pigmented colonies on prolonged incubation. They grow on blood agar; on delayed incubation of 3-4 days, the colonies of B. cepacia die. The bacteria do not grow on DCA agar. B. cepacia is oxidase positive. It utilizes glucose, lactose, malt- ose, and mannitol with production of acid only. It is ornithine decarboxylase and lysine decarboxylase positive. But arginine dihydrolase is negative. B. cepacia is a motile bacterium due to the presence of polar tuft of flagella. B. cepacia is an opportunistic pathogen. It is found in moist environment surfaces and is associated with nosocomial or hospital-acquired infections. It causes respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease and also urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. It has also been reported to cause pneumonitis, osteo-myelitis, wound infections, and septicemias in patients with contaminated intravenous catheter and endocarditis in drug addicts.B. cepacia is susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and ceftazidime. But penicillins, Pseudomonas mallei, was first isolated by Loeffler and Scotch in 1882 from a horse suffering from glanders. The bacterium is known to cause glanders, which is a serious disease of equine animals, but capable of transmission to other animals (goats, dogs, and cats) and humans. B. mallei is a slender, Gram-negative, small bacillus measur- ing 2.5 /H9262m in length. It stains irregularly, often giving a beaded appearance. It is non-motile. It is an aerobe and facultative anaerobe, which can grow on ordinary culture media. It pro-duces small and translucent colonies, which become yellowish on prolonged incubation. It is relatively biochemically inert, fermenting only glucose. In animals (such as horses), B. mallei produces two types of clinical syndrome: glandular and farcy. B. mallei can be trans-mitted occasionally to humans from infected animals suffer-ing from glanders. The infection is transmitted by inoculation of injured skin or the mucous membrane with contaminated discharges. The condition is mostly occupational, found among veterinarians and persons handling horses and other equine animals. In humans, B. mallei may cause acute or chronic infection with that localized to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or respi-ratory tract. Human cases of glanders are usually rare. Acute infection is characterized as an acute fulminant febrile disease with mucopurulent nasal discharge and severe prostration. Mortality rate is very high. Chronic infection produces local-ized abscesses in the skin or respiratory tract. Glanders in animals may be diagnosed by a skin test known as Mallein test. The skin test is similar to the tuberculin test demon- strating a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to protein of B. mallei. The condition can also be diagnosed by intraperitoneal inocula-tion of clinical specimens into male adult guinea pigs. The posi-tive test is demonstrated by appearance of swelling of the testes, inflammation of tunica vaginalis, and ulceration of scrotal skin in 2-3 days of inoculation. This reaction is known as Strauss reaction . B. mallei infection is being documented frequently in parts of Asia, Africa, Middle East, Central America, and South America. B. mallei is usually sensitive to ciprofloxacin, strepto- mycin, novobiocin, gentamicin, imepenem, and sulfonamides. Treatment with these antibiotics is usually given for 1-2 months along with surgical drainage of pus from the affected site. B. mallei is usually resistant to chloramphenicol. Burkholderia pseudomallei B. pseudomallei pseudomallei. It is the causative agent of melioidosis (from Greek word, meaning resemblance to dis-temper of asses) in rodents. B. pseudomallei was first described by Whitmore and Krishnaswamy (1902) from a glanders-like disease in BURKHOLDERIA, AND MORAXELLA 319 the bacillus and gave the name Bacillus pseudomallei. Stantum and Felcher (1921, 1925) redesignated the bacteria as Bacillus whit- more responsible for melioidosis in humans. Subsequently, this bacterium was renamed as Pseudomonas pseudomallei and now it is known as B. pseudomallei. B. pseudomallei is saprophyte found in contaminated water, soil, and plants. B. pseudomallei resembles B. mallei but differs in being motile; also, it liquefies gelatin and forms acid from several sugars. B. pseudomallei causes melioidosis in humans. The condition shows different stages such as acute, local, and chronic infections. The incubation period is variable. It may range from as short as 2 days to as high as too many years. Acute melioidosis is characterized by development of a nodule at the site of inoculation of the bacteria in the skin. The bacteria can subsequently spread, causing secondary lym-phangitis, regional lymphangitis, fever, and myalgia. Acute melioidosis may progress rapidly to acute septicemia with high mortality rate. Acute blood stream infection is most commonly seen in patients with HIV, diabetes, renal failure, etc. The condi-tion results in septic shock. Pulmonary infection manifests as mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia. The condition is associated with high fever, head-ache, chest pain, anorexia, and general myalgia. Nonproductive or productive cough with normal sputum is typical manifesta-tion of this condition. Chronic suppurative infection is associated with multi- ple caseous or suppurative foci of infection in several organs including joints, skin, lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, liver, and brain. Bacteria remain as intracellular pathogens of the retic-uloendothelial system, which contributes to long latency and reactivation of the infection. Melioidosis caused by the bacteria is endemic in Southeast Asia. In India, most cases of malleiodiosis are reported from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Orissa, West Bengal, and Tripura. Diagnosis of the condition is made by: Key Points Melioidosis is primarily a disease of rats, but also occurs in guinea pigs and rabbits. Humans acquire infection either by inhalation of infected aerosols, inoculation of contaminated material, or inges-tion of food and water contaminated with excreta of infected animals. The infection also may be transmitted by the bite of hema-tophagous insects. Agricultural workers are highly susceptible to infection. Demonstration of Gram-negative bacilli in the Gram-stained smears; and also demonstration of typical bipolar safety pin appearance of the bacteria in the methylene blue staining of the clinical specimens, such as exudates. Isolation of B. pseudomallei by culture of urine, sputum, pus, or blood confirms the diagnosis of B. pseudomallei infection. Serology is frequently helpful for diagnosis of melioidosis, especially chronic melioidosis. ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and IHA (indirect hemagglutination) are used to demonstrate specific IgM and IgG antibodies in patients with melioidosis. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) which has also been evaluated to detect B. pseudomallei genome in pus, spu-tum, and other specimens. B. pseudomallei is susceptible to ceftazidime, which is the drug of choice. Other antibiotics include tetracycline, cotrimoxa-zole, and chloramphenicol. Prolonged therapy with antibiotics is essential to treat the patient. Moraxella Genus Moraxella consists of at least seven species, which can cause infections in humans. These are Gram-negative cocci or short rods recognized on the basis of nucleic acid analysis. They are arranged mainly in pairs and may be confused with those of gonococci. They are nonmotile, noncapsulated, and nonflagellated bacteria. They are oxidase and catalase positive. They do not produce acid from carbohydrates. They are obligate aerobes and grow well at 32-36\u00b0C. They produce small colonies on blood agar after 24 hours of incubation but show poor or no growth on MacConkey agar. M. catarrhalis is the most important human patho- gen. It is found as a normal commensal in the respiratory tract of humans. It is a Gram-negative coccus measuring about 0.8 /H9262 m in diameter. It is arranged singly or in pairs with adjacent sides flattened. The bacteria are also found in groups of tetrads. They are aerobes. They grow well at on optimum temperature of 36\u00b0C. Most strains grow on nutrient agar, blood agar, and chocolate agar. On blood agar, after 24 hours of incubation, they produce nonhemo-lytic, white or grayish, convex colonies with entire margins. On prolonged incubation at 4 hours, the colonies become large with elevated margins and a raised opaque center. The bacteria do not grow on the media selective for gono-cocci due to the presence of colistin to which it is sensitive. M. catarrhalis is: oxidase and catalase positive; differentiated from Neisseria species positive DNAse test and a positive tributyrin hydrolysis test; an opportunistic pathogen; a common cause of bronchitis and bronchopneumonia seen in patients with chronic pulmonary disease and in elderly patients; also associated with sinusitis and otitis, most commonly in healthy people; resistant to penicillins due to production of beta-lactamases; and susceptible to other antibiotics, such as BACTERIOLOGY 55-year-old man was admitted to a hospital with 65% burns following an accident in kitchen. The infected pus from the skin showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa by culture. The patient was treated for 7 days with broad-spectrum antibiotics. On eighth day of hospitalization, the patient experienced fever and chill. The blood cultures were repeatedly positive for P. aeruginosa. The patient succumbed to the infection and died after 15 days. What are the factors that increase susceptibility of the patient to P. aeruginosa infection? What are the virulence factors that make P. aeruginosa a serious pathogen? What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance demonstrated in P. aeruginosa? How will you prevent nosocomial infections caused by P. aeruginosa ?CASE STUDY Chap-37.indd 320 12:09:17 the genus Haemophilus, Pasteurella, and Actinobacillus cause a variety of infections in humans. They require a complex media for their growth and isolation. Haemophilus The members of the genus Haemophilus are small, sometimes pleomorphic, Gram-negative, nonmotile, and nonsporing organisms. They require one or both the accessory growth fac-tors, namely, X and V present in the blood. Hence, the genus derived its name from its essential growth requirement of cer-tain factors, such as X and V present in the blood (haemophilus: haem, blood; philus, loving). Koch in the year 1883 isolated Haemophilus aegyptius, first member of the genus from a case of conjunctivitis in Egypt. Haemophilus spp. are obligate bacteria present in the mucous membranes of the humans and certain species of animals. Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus ducreyi are two major species associated with disease in humans. H. influenzae causes meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, bronchitis, and otitis media. H. ducreyi is the causative sexually transmitted disease, soft chancre, or chancroid. Haemophilus aphrophilus is less frequent but an important cause of endocarditis. Other Haemophilus species are rarely patho- genic. They are responsible primarily for opportunistic infec-tions (Table 38-1).Haemophilus influenzae H. influenzae is the species most commonly associated with human disease. It is an important cause of meningitis in chil-dren and also of respiratory tract infection in children as well as in adults. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology H. influenzae is a small, pleomorphic, Gram-negative bacillus. It measures 1 /H11003 0.3 /H9262m. In fresh cultures, the bacteria are usu-ally coccobacilli, while in older cultures, long filamentous forms are seen. The bacteria are nonmotile, nonsporing, and nonacid fast. Some strains of H. influenzae possess polysaccharides cap-sule. The capsule can be detected by India ink preparation or by capsular swelling reaction using type-specific antiserum. Culture H. influenzae is a fastidious bacterium. It is facultative anaerobe, grows better in anaerobic condition. The optimal temperature is 35-37\u00b0C. They do not grow below 22\u00b0C. Presence of 5-10% CO 2 enhances the growth of the bacteria. Growth factors: H. influenzae requires two erythrocytic growth factors, X factor and V factor. These factors are released follow-ing lysis of blood cells, thereby allowing growth of fastidious H. inf luenzae on the chocolate agar. H. influenzae cannot grow on nutrient agar, because it lacks these Haemophilus segnis Occasional opportunistic infectionTABLE PMSection X factor: It is a heat-stable factor present in blood. It is a protoporphyrin IX, hemin, or other iron-containing porphyrin. X factor is required for the synthesis of iron-containing bacterial enzymes, such as catalase, cytochrome oxidase, and peroxidase.V factor: It is a heat-labile factor present in red blood cells and in other animal and plant cells. This factor is destroyed at 120\u00b0C in 30 minutes. This factor is also synthesized by Staphylococcus aureus and also by some fungi. Earlier this factor was thought to be a vitamin, hence was named V factor. This has now been identified as NAD or NADP coenzyme I. The V factor appears to act as hydrogen acceptor in oxidation-reduction process in a replicating bacterial cell. H. influenzae produces large colonies on the blood or chocolate agar by any of the following methods: Chocolate agar: V factor is released from erythrocytes by heat-ing blood agar at 80-90\u00b0C in order to prepare chocolate agar. The released V factor from the erythrocytes supple-ments the growth of colonies. By using S. aureus as source of V factor: V factor is produced by staphylococci; hence growth on blood agar can be promoted by providing S. aureus as source of V factor. Blood agar with S. aureus streak is routinely used for culture and identifica-tion of H. influenzae. In this procedure, a suspected isolate of H. influenzae is streaked on a blood agar plate. Then S. aureus is streaked across the same blood agar plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 hours. After incubation, the colonies of H. influenzae nearer to the S. aureus are larger than those away from it. This phenomenon is known as satellitism. This dem- onstrates that V factor is available in increased concentra-tion near the staphylococcal colony and in a lower concen-tration away from it (Fig. 38-1, Color Photo 40). Fildes' agar or Levinthal's agar are clear and transparent media used for primary isolation and culture of H. influenzae. These are prepared by boiling and filtering a mixture of blood and nutrient broth (Levinthal's agar) or by adding a peptic blood to nutrient agar (Fildes' agar). The capsulated strains of larger, 1-3-mm diameter, high convex, and mucoid colonies on the media containing blood (chocolate agar, Fildes' agar, or Levinthal's agar) conspicuous iridescence on Levinthal's agar. Fildes' agar is used best for primary isola-tion of H. influenzae. In contrast, on these media, noncapsu-lated strains produce relatively smaller, low convex, smooth, and transparent colonies. Chocolate agar containing penicillin and bacitracin is usu- ally used for isolation of H. influenzae from clinical specimens, which consist of normal bacterial flora. Growth of H. influenzae on ordinary blood agar is scanty and the colonies are small because the V factor is not freely available being found inside the red blood cells. H. influenzae does not produce any hemolysis on blood agar.Variations: H. influenzae colonies show a smooth to rough vari- ation associated with loss of capsular antigen and subsequent loss of virulence. The genetic characteristics of capsular antigen and antibiotic resistance can be transformed. Nonencapsulated strains of H. influenzae can become capsulated by transfer of genetic matter that codes for the capsule. Biochemical reactions H. influenzae shows the following biochemical reactions: It is catalase and oxidase positive. It ferments glucose and galactose, but does not ferment lac-tose, sucrose, and mannitol. It reduces nitrates to nitrites. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: H. influenzae is a delicate bacillus. It is readily killed within 30 minutes by moist heat at 55\u00b0C. It dies within a few days at 4\u00b0C as well as in culture plates and dies in less than 2 days in dried clinical secre-tions. Bacteria are sensitive to commonly used disinfectants and also to desiccation. Cultures are difficult to maintain due to autolysis. Cultures may be preserved by frequent subcultures on chocolate agar. Lyophilization is a good method for long-term preservation of H. influenzae culture. Cell Wall Structures and Antigenic Properties The cell wall of H. influenzae is typical of other Gram-negative bacilli; lipopolysaccharide with endotoxin activities is present in the cell wall. Species-specific and strain-specific proteins are present in the outer membranes. Three major surface anti-gens are present in H. influenzae. They are (a) capsular poly-saccharide antigen, (b) outer membrane protein (OMP), and (c) lipooligosaccharide. Capsular polysaccharide antigen Capsular polysaccharide deter-minant of encapsulated H. influenzae. This antigen is present in the capsulated strain, which produces a capsule that is polysac-charide in nature. This antigen is not found in unencapsulated strains of H. influenzae. The polysaccharide antigen Chapter 38HAEMOPHILUS, PASTEURELLA, AND ACTINOBACILLUS 323 type specificity to the organism and is the basis for grouping of organism into six antigenic serotypes. These six antigenic sero-types are designated as a, b, c, d, e, and f. Type b capsular polysaccharide is a host-protective antigen, which contains polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP), hence is used in a number of PRP vaccines and PRP-protein conjugate vaccines. These proteins induce IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies which are bactericidal, opsonic, and protective. H. influenzae serotype b was responsible for more than 95% of all invasive Haemophilus infection before the introduction of H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. But after the introduction of Hib vac-cine, specifically directed against H. influenzae serotype b, most disease caused by this serotype has been reduced. After the vaccination era, serotypes c and f as well as nonencapsulated H. influenzae are responsible for most H. influenzae disease. Outer membrane proteins The OMP antigens show considerable variations. The OMP antigens of Hib have been classified into 13 subtypes. Lipooligosaccharide Lipooligosaccharide is antigenically complex. Pathogenesis and Immunity the obligate bacteria present in the mucous membranes of humans and certain species of animals. The encapsulated strains, such as strain type b are usually associ-ated with invasive conditions, such as pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, cellulitis, septic arthritis, etc. The unencapsulated strains primarily cause infections at mucosal surfaces, includ-ing otitis media, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. Virulence factors (Table 38-2): Capsular polysaccharide: Capsular polysaccharide is the major virulence factor in Hib. This polysaccharide capsule, which contains ribose, ribitol, and phosphate, known as PRP, is antiphagocytic. It resists phagocytosis of the bacteria by leu-kocytes. Loss of capsule leads to loss of virulence of the bacteria. Antibodies against this capsule are protective. It promotes bacte-rial phagocytosis and complement-mediated bactericidal activi-ties. These antibodies are produced during natural infection or on vaccination with purified PRP or passive transfer of maternal antibodies from mother to children. The risk of meningitis and epiglottitis is much higher in patients with no anti-PRP anti-bodies or in patients with low level of complement.Lipid A lipopolysaccharide: This has been suggested to be responsible for inducing meningococcal inflammation in humans as demonstrated in experimental animal models.IgA1 protease: Both encapsulated and nonencapsulated H. influenzae produce IgA1 protease that specifically splits heavy chain of IgA1. Break down of immunoglobulin IgA facilitates colonization of H. influenzae on mucosal surface.Pili: Pili help in adherence of H. influenzae to epithelial cells. Pathogenesis of H. influenzae infection H. influenzae enters the human host by respiratory route. Pili and nonpilous adhesions of the bacteria mediate colonization of H. influenzae in the oropharynx or nasopharynx. Lipid A lipo- polysaccharide impairs ciliary function, leading to damage of the respiratory mucosa. A large bacterial load or the presence of concomitant viral infection can potentiate the infection of the bacteria that invade the mucosa and enter the blood stream. The presence of antibodies, complement components, and phagocytes determines the clearance of bacteremia. The absence of anti-PRP antibodies contributes to bacterial multiplication. Subsequent high-grade bacteremia leads to dissemination of bacteria to various sites including meninges, subcutaneous tissues, joints, and even pleura and pericardium. Bacteremia usually precedes Hib meningitis and other inva- sive Hib diseases. Direct extension of infection from the sinuses or ears is rare. The magnitude and duration of bacteremia are the primary determinants of central nervous system (CNS) invasion, which occurs through the choroid plexus. Meningitis occurs as a result of inflammation, edema, and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Brain parenchy-mal invasion is rare. Noncapsulated or nontypable influenza strains, which colonize up to 80% of individuals, cause infection by direct extension from the colonized sites. Spread of bacteria by direct extension to sinuses causes sinusitis, to the Eustachian tube causes otitis media, and down the respiratory tract results in bronchitis and pneumonia. Host immunity Antibodies directed against the PRP component of capsule play a primary role in conferring immunity.

By age of 5 years, most children have naturally acquired antibodies. Clinical Syndromes The clinical syndromes caused by H. influenzae can be classified into two types as follows (Fig. 38-2): 1. Infections caused by encapsulated H. influenzae 2. Inf ections caused by by encapsulated H. influenzae Meningitis: Meningitis is the most serious manifestation of Hib infection. It occurs primarily in children of 2 months to 2 years of age. Altered mental state and fever are most common symptoms. Headache and photophobia are usually present in older children. Mortality rate is above 90% in untreated chil-dren. Hib meningitis is rare in adults.Epiglottitis: Epiglottitis is the second most common infec- tion of H. influenzae and is a life-threatening emergency. This condition is seen in children of 3-18 months of age after Hib vaccine era. This condition is characterized by cellulites and obstructive laryngeal edema.

Schematic Haemophilus influenzae .Cellulitis: H. influenzae causing cellulitis is typically seen in children. The buccal and periorbital regions are most com-monly involved. Fever, indurations, and tender area in the head and neck particularly in the buccal and preseptal areas charac-terize the condition.Septic arthritis: Septic arthritis in children is characterized by involvement of single large joint, such as knee, ankle, hip, or elbow. In adults, joint involvement can be monoarticular or polyarticular.Pneumonia: Pneumonia typically occurs in infants and is clinically indistinguishable from other bacterial pneumonias.Suppurative lesions: Hib can cause suppurative lesions, such as epiglottitis, and septic arthritis. Endophthalmitis, cervical adenitis, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis are less com-mon invasive infections caused by Hib. Infections caused by nonencapsulated strains The nontypable influenzae are the opportunistic bacteria causing infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract. These strains cause otitis media, bronchitis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis. Nonencapsulated H. influenzae along with Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of otitis media. Nontypable H. influenzae is a major causative agent of conjunctivitis in older children, next only to S. pneumoniae. This is the most common cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults. Key Points Nontypable H. influenzae rarely causes invasive disease. Invasive disease by these strains is associated with malignancies, alcoholism, old age, congenital heart disease, and CNS signs. Nontypable H. influenzae infection with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and HIV leads to exacerbation of COPD. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Hib was a leading cause of infections among children world-wide before Hib vaccines became available. After the avail-ability of the Hib vaccine, the frequency of invasive Hib disease has reduced remarkably even in the developing coun-tries. The frequency of Hib infection has come down to only 2-3 cases/100,000 children below 5 years. So, majority of Hib infection now occurs in (a) nonimmune children due to incom-plete vaccination or poor antibody response to the vaccine and (b) in elderly people. In the developed countries with successful implementation of Hib vaccination program, disease caused by other serotypes of encapsulated bacteria and by nontypable strains of H. influ-enzae is being increasingly recognized. Chap-38.indd 5/14/2012 12:08:38 PMSection Chapter 38HAEMOPHILUS, PASTEURELLA, AND 325 Habitat H. influenzae is a strict human pathogen. Humans are the only natural hosts. Nonencapsulated strains are regular commen-sals of the nasopharyngeal mucosa and of the oropharynx. They colonize at the site in virtually all children within the first few months of life. In contrast, H. influenzae serotype b is rarely found in the upper respiratory tract or, if found, is present in few children (1-5% of cases). Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Human cases are important reservoir of infection. The infected nasopharyngeal mucosal secretion is the most common source of infection. Transmission is by inhalation of respiratory tract droplets or by direct contact. Transmission to neonates occurs through the maternal genital tract. Nontypable H. influenzae biotype 4 can colonize the genital tract and is a major cause of invasive disease in neonates. Biotyping H. influenzae has been subdivided into eight biotypes on the basis of three biochemical reactions: (a) indole production, (b) urease activity, and (c) ornithine decarboxylase activity. Most of the clinical isolates belong to the biotypes I-III. Type b H. influenzae belongs to biotype I. Phage typing and other typing H. influenzae is of four phage types. These are HP1, HP3, S2, and N3. Furthermore, Hib produces bacteriocin, which is known as \"hemocin.\" This bacteriocin is active against other serotypes of capsulated strains, other species of Haemophilus, and against Escherichia coli. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens CSF and blood are the specimens of choice for the diagnosis of meningitis. One to two milliliters of CSF is usually collected from the patients for performing various tests. In meningitis, the CSF shows pleocytosis (mean 4000-5000 WBC/mL) with a predominance of neutrophils. It shows decreased CSF glucose level and elevated CSF protein. Blood is a frequently used specimen for culture for diagno- sis of cellulitis, epiglottitis, arthritis, or pneumonia caused by Hib. Throat swab, pus, and aspirates from joints, middle ear, and sinuses are the other specimens collected depending on the lesions caused by H. influenzae. All the specimens are collected under strict aseptic condi- tions in sterile containers. Since H. influenzae is very sensitive to low temperatures, the clinical specimens are never refrig-erated but are kept in incubator at 37\u00b0C before transporting to the laboratory. The specimens are transported immediately to the laboratory for processing and better isolation of the pathogen. Microscopy Gram-staining smear of the CSF shows small, Gram-negative coccobacilli in more than 80% of the CSF from cases of untreated meningitis (Fig. 38-3). Gram-stained smear is also useful as a rapid diagnostic method for demonstration of H. influenzae in lower respiratory tract disease and arthritis. Culture Detection of H. influenzae in blood, CSF, or other body fluids by culture confirms the diagnosis of H. influenzae infection. CSF culture is useful in cases of meningitis. On chocolate agar or Levinthal's agar, H. influenzae colonies appear as 1-2-mm, smooth, and opaque colonies after 24 hours of incubation. H. influenzae on blood agar can also be detected by satellitism as described earlier. Blood culture is useful in the cases of epiglot-titis and pneumonia; 70-80% of persons with epiglottitis have positive blood culture result. Identification of bacteria The colonies are identified by: 1. Typical colony morphology\u20141-2 mm, smooth, and opaque colonies after 24 hours' incubation on chocolate agar . 2. Demonstration of requirements for X and V factors by satellitism (Fig. 38-1). 3. Specif ic on chocolate agar. 3. Ferment glucose and galactose, but do not ferment lactose, sucrose, and mannitol. 4. Catalase and oxidase positive. 5. The serotyping of encapsulated H. inf luenzae is carried out by Quellung reaction, coagglutination, or ELISA methods, and recently by using a DNA probe.Box 38-1 Identifying features of of encapsulated H. influenzae is carried out by several including agglutination reaction, Quellung reaction, coagglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, and recently by using a DNA probe. Quellung reaction is carried out by using antisera pre- pared against type-specific polysaccharide. Fresh isolates from infected patients or primary isolates can be typed by this method. DNA probe is used currently for typing encapsulated H. influenzae. The probe hybridizes with a fragment to chro-mosomal DNA, which codes for the production of capsular antigen. However, noncapsulated strains cannot be typed, hence are called nontypable strains. Antigen detection Latex agglutination (LAT), co-agglutination (Co-A), counter-current immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP), and ELISA are the tests that can be used to detect polysaccharide antigen b in body fluids. Key Points Detection of H. influenzae PRP capsular antigen in the CSF and urine is a rapid and sensitive method for diagnosis of Hib dis-ease. These antigens can be detected by CIEP, LAT, Co-A, and ELISA. The disadvantage of the antigen detection test is that it can detect only Hib infection, but not other capsular serotypes and nonencapsulated strains of H. influenzae (because all the strains lack capsule, they do not have capsular polysaccharide antigen). Treatment Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment of H. influenzae infections. H. influenzae is are the initial drugs of choice of treatment of Hib meningitis. These antibiotics given paren-terally to patients with uncomplicated meningitis for 7-14 days are effective. Penicillins are useful in the management of muco-sal infections caused by nonencapsulated H. influenzae. As many as 25-50% of isolates produce beta-lactamase; therefore, they are resistant to this class of drugs. Beta-lactamase-producing oral antibiotics, with activity against H. axetil, cefixime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. These drugs are given for 10 days in cases of otitis media and for at least 14 days for sinusitis. Prevention and Control Vaccination The Hib conjugate vaccine, now routinely given to infants and children, is highly effective. The vaccine has dramatically reduced the prevalence of invasive Hib disease. The vaccine elic-its a protective antibody response and prevents Hib disease by reducing pharyngeal colonization with Hib. The Hib conjugate vaccine, however, is not effective against disease caused by non-typable H. influenzae. Originally, the Hib vaccine was an unconjugated polysac- charide vaccine, which consisted of the purified PRP capsu-lar polysaccharide. This vaccine, however, was not effective because it induced a poor immune response, did not protect children fully, and did not provide any antibody protection for infants. This therefore led to the development of the con-jugate Hib vaccines in which PRP is covalently linked to a protein. Hib vaccines Currently, three types of Hib vaccines are available. These vary in (a) the protein carrier used, (b) the molecular size of the sac-charide, and (c) the method of conjugating the protein to the saccharide. These vaccines are: (i) HbOC (mutant diphtheria toxin as the carrier protein) (ii) PRP-T (tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein) (iii) PRP-OMP (major OMP of N eisseria meningitidis serogroup B as the carrier protein) The HbOC or PRP-T is injected in a three-dose regimen, while PRP-OMP is given in a two-dose regimen at 2-months' inter-vals and first dose is given at age of 2 months. Booster dose is given at the age of 12-15 months. These vaccines are well-tolerated. Occasionally, they cause redness and swelling at the site of vaccination in 10-15% of infants, especially after the first dose rather than after subsequent injections. Chemoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis by rifampin is used to reduce the coloniza-tion of Hib disease in children with high risk. Such high-risk group includes children below 2 years in a family or daycare centre where systemic disease is reported. Other Haemophilus Species Haemophilus ducreyi H. ducreyi is an important causative agent of sexually transmit-ted disease called soft sore or chancroid in Asia and Africa. It is an obligate bacterium. H. ducreyi grows poorly on most media, requires X factor, but not V factor, and is biochemically inert. It produces very small colonies (0.5-mm diameter) on chocolate agar after prolonged incubation of 72 hours in the presence of CO 2. The chancroid is seen most commonly in men, and the condition remains asymptomatic in women. The incubation period varies from 5 to 7 days, after which a papule with an ery-thematous surface appears on the genitalia or on the perianal area. Subsequently, the lesion ulcerates and becomes painful. The condition is frequently associated with inguinal lymphade-nopathy. Gram-stain H. aphrophilus is present as a commensal in the mouth and in the throat. On chocolate agar, it forms yellowish, high convex, large colonies (1.5-mm diameter) after 24 hours of incubation. It requires only X factor, but not V factor, and as the name sug-gests, it also requires high concentration of CO 2 for growth. H. aphrophilus, which is present as a commensal in the mouth, can spread to the blood stream and infect previously infected heart valve, causing subacute endocarditis. It can also cause brain abscess, pneumonia, and sinusitis. Haemophilus parainfluenzae H. parainfluenzae is an opportunistic pathogen in the upper respiratory tract. Occasionally, the bacteria may cause endocar-ditis, conjunctivitis, and bronchopulmonary infection. It forms relatively bigger colonies than those of H. influenzae on choco-late agar, which are opaque and yellowish white. It differs from H. influenzae in requiring the V factor only and not the X factor, fermenting sucrose but not D-xylose. Haemophilus aegyptius H. aegyptius was earlier known as Koch-Weeks bacillus. This was observed by Koch in 1883 in a case of acute conjunctivi-tis and subsequently was first cultured by Weeks in 1887. The organism causes highly contagious form of acute conjunctivitis. It closely resembles H. influenzae; however, it differs from H. influenzae by being nutritionally more exacting, not ferment-ing xylose and by not being present as a commensal in the naso-pharynx of healthy people. Haemophilus haemolyticus H. haemolyticus is present as a commensal in the upper respira- tory tract. It is a nonpathogen and does not cause any human disease. On blood agar, it produces a zone of hemolysis around the colonies and may be mistaken for hemolytic streptococci. It requires both X and V factors. Pasteurella nonmotile Gram-negative coccobacilli and are aerobes and anaerobes. They show a bipolar appearance in stained smears. They grow on blood agar and chocolate agar, but show variable growth on the MacConkey agar. They are commonly found as commensals in the orophar-ynx of healthy animals and cause septicemia in a variety of ani-mals and birds. They are found rarely in the human oropharynx. The genus Pasteurella consists of more than 17 species. Pasteurella multocida is the most common species causing infec- tion in humans. Other species, which rarely cause human Most human infections result from animal contact, such as animal scratches, bites, etc.Pasteurella multocida P. multocida is a nonmotile Gram-negative bacillus. The organ- ism generally resembles Yersinia, but differs from it in being oxi- dase positive and producing indole. The bacterium grows well on blood and chocolate agars, but grows poorly on MacConkey agar. On blood agar, after overnight incubation, P. multocida produces large buttery colonies with a characteristic musty odor of the colonies due to production of indole. P. multocida is present in the upper respiratory tract of dogs, cats, rats, cattle, and sheep. The bacteria sometimes are also present in the human upper respiratory tract. Human infec-tion is rare but may occur following animal bites or trauma. After a bite or scratch by cats or dogs, a localized cellulitis and adenitis occurs at the site of bite. Patients with underly-ing pulmonary lesions may also show exacerbation of respira-tory tract infections (such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis). P. multocida in immunocompromised patients may cause a systemic infection. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice. Tetracycline, cepha- losporins, or fluoroquinolones are other antibiotics equally effective against the bacteria. Actinobacillus Actinobacillus are small, nonmotile, and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli. The bacteria grow slowly on culture media requiring 2-3 days of incubation. Actinobacillus are present in the oropharynx of humans and animals and cause a variety of infections. The genus Actinobacillus consists of at least six species, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is the most important human pathogen. Other species cause very rare human infections (Table 38-4). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans A. actinomycetemcomitans is relatively uncommon agent of periodontitis, endocarditis, and opportunistic infections in humans. A. actinomycetemcomitans is so named because the organism is frequently associated with actinomyces (Latin word: comitans means accompanying). The bacteria in humans con-stitute the normal flora of the oral cavity, particularly in the gingival and supragingival cervices.Bacteria Diseases Pasteurella multocida of cat- or dog-bite wound, exacerbation of respiratory tract infections, and systemic infection in immunocompromised patients Pasteurella canis Dog-bite wound infection organisms are normally present in the oropharynx, which under certain conditions can cause severe infections, such as endocarditis. Since they are fastidious organisms to grow, they are usually incriminated as a frequent cause of culture-negative endocarditis. These organisms also cause a wide variety of diseases including oti-tis media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, osteo-myelitis, urinary tract infections, wound infections, brain abscess, periodontal infections, etc. Infective endocarditis (IE) is a major clinical condition caused by HACEK group of organisms: 1. Haemophilus species is responsible for 0.5-1% of all cases of IE. Of these, majority (nearly 40%) are caused by H. aphroph- ilus, followed by H. parainfluenzae. H. influenzae rarely causes IE despite causing bacteremias. Nearly one-third of cases of H. aphrophilus IE are due to dental disease and one-fifth are due to sinusitis or otitis media. 2. A. is the causative presentation peri- odontitis. The condition is characterized by gingivitis and severe periodontal attachment loss. The bacteria also cause IE, especially in patients with underlying heart disease and with infection of prosthetic valve, usually aortic. 3. C. hominis are Gram-negative or Gram-variable, pleomor - phic bacilli with round swelling of both ends. They are characteristically arranged in chains, clusters, or rosettes. These organisms are present as part of the normal flora of the mouth and upper respiratory tract. These bacteria usually cause infections of the blood stream preceded by oral pathology. C. hominis causes endocarditis in majority (75%) of patients with underlying heart diseases. Arterial embolization is also observed in many patients. 4. E. corrodens are Gram-negative, pleomor phic, often cocco- bacillary. They are facultatively anaerobic. They are found as part of the normal oral flora and many other mucosal surfaces. E. corrodens is so named due to its ability to cor- rode the agar during growth in the culture. E. corrodens is a well-known cause of cellulitis following human bites and clenched-fist injuries, soft-tissue infec-tions, and endocarditis in drug addicts. This organism is also associated with a variety of respiratory tract infec-tions including pneumonia, empyema, etc. They cause A. actinomycetemcomitans grows slowly on chocolate and blood agar producing demonstrable colonies after 2-3 days of incubation. On blood agar, the colonies are smooth, trans-lucent, and nonhemolytic with irregular edges. It does not require X or V factors, but an increased concentration of CO 2 for better isolation of the colonies. It fails to grow on MacConkey agar. A. actinomycetemcomitans is indole negative, negative, and also lysine, ornithine, and arginine negative. It is catalase positive and nitrate reduc-tase positive. It shows a variable oxidase reaction. It ferments glucose, but does not ferment lactose or sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans can cause subacute bacterial endocarditis particularly in patients with preexisting val-vular heart diseases and oral diseases, such as oral abscess, poor oral hygiene, periodontitis, etc. The bacteria invade oropharynx and blood stream, adhere to the damaged heart valves, and cause the disease. The bacteria are suscep-tible to aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, chloramphenicol, are treated with cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Differential features of important Haemophilus, Pasteurella, and Actinobacillus species are summarized in Table 38-5.

Kingella species are small Gram-negative bacteria and var y in shapes from cocci to coccobacilli. The genus Kingella The endocarditis caused by K. kingae, although rare, progresses very rapidly. Laboratory diagnosis of IE caused by HACEK organisms depends on blood culture, followed by subculture on blood agar and chocolate agar supplemented with vitamins and other nutrients. The media are incubated in a humid atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide or anaerobically for 24-72 hours. Blood cul-ture bottles are incubated for a minimum of 14 days, followed by terminal subculture before declaring it negative. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. Due to delay in blood culture, antibiotics are usually started empirically. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice. Ampicillin combined with gentamicin is also equally useful. However, of late, resistance to beta-lactams has been reported among HACEK group of organisms. A 2-year-old child was brought to pediatric OPD with history of fever, headache, convulsions, and vomiting. Physical examination showed presence of neck rigidity and pus in the external auditory canal. Further enquiry revealed that the child had a bout of upper respiratory tract infection in previous week. Provisional diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made. CSF protein was raised, but glucose was decreased. CSF was sent for Gram stain, culture and sensitivity, and biochemical analysis. Gram stain revealed presence of pus cells and pleomorphic Gram-negative coccobacilli. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated by culture. Describe the methods followed in a laboratory for isolation of the bacteria. Can meningitis caused by H. influenzae be prevented by vaccination? Discuss the recent vaccines with their advantages and disadvantages. List other infections caused by this organism. Which is the antibiotic of choice to treat these bacteria?CASE STUDY Chap-38.indd 329 5/14/2012 12:08:39 PM39 Introduction Genus Bordetella includes the bacteria that are extremely small, strictly aerobic, nonfermentative, and Gram-negative coccoba-cilli. These are obligate respiratory tract pathogens of warm-blooded animals including birds. The genus Francisella includes the bacteria that are strictly aerobic and fastidious, hence can-not be cultured on common laboratory media. Bordetella The genus Bordetella consists of seven recognized species; of which, three are responsible for human diseases (Table 39-1). These are Bordetella pertussis , agent responsible for whooping cough, or pertussis; Bordetella parapertussis, responsible for disease similar to pertussis but the disease is milder; and Bordetella bron- chiseptica, responsible for pertussis-like symptoms in humans. Bordetella avium is a pathogen of birds, which causes infection in turkey poultry, but does not cause any infection in humans. Bordetella pertussis B. pertussis ( pertussis, Latin for intense cough) is the causative agent of whooping cough, an infectious bacterial illness that affects the respiratory tract. Whooping cough is one of many diseases that can be prevented by vaccine. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology B. pertussis shows the following features: B. pertussis are extremely small ovoid coccobacilli measuring 0.2-0.5 /H11003 1 /H9262m. Characteristically, they demonstrate pleomorphism in their morphology. They are Gram negative, occurring in singles or in pairs, and are nonmotile and nonsporing. Bordetella and Francisella Bacteria Diseases Bordetella pertussis Whooping cough or pertussis Bordetella parapertussis Milder form of pertussis Bordetella bronchiseptica Pertussis-like symptoms in humansTABLE 39-1Human infections caused by Bordetella species Toluidine blue staining of the bacteria demonstrates characteristic bipolar metachromatic granules. Freshly isolated strain of B. pertussis possesses a poorly defined capsule and also fimbriae. In culture smears, the bacilli are arranged in loose clumps with clear spaces in between, giving a thumbprint appearance. Culture B. pertussis is a strict aerobe with an optimum temperature for growth 35\u00baC. The bacteria are nutritionally fastidious. They do not grow on common laboratory media, such as blood agar and nutrient agar. Even on blood agar, the bacteria grow slowly and require 3-6 days to form pinpoint colonies. The bacteria are usually grown on a rich medium supple- mented with charcoal, starch, blood, albumin, and growth fac-tors, such as nicotinamide. The latter is absolutely essential for the growth of the bacteria. Blood or albumin present in the medium is used apparently not to provide nutrition for the growth of bacteria but to neutralize toxic substances, such as fatty acids present in the agar. Bordet-Gengou agar with 15-20% of blood is a common medium used for primary isolation of B. pertussis. This medium consists of glycerol, potato, agar, and 15-20% of blood. After 48-72 hours of incubation, B. pertussis produces small, smooth, opaque, grayish white refractile colonies resembling bisected pearls or mercury drops. A hazy zone of hemolysis is present around the colonies. Confluent growth of B. pertussis on the medium typically presents an aluminum paint appearance. Charcoal agar with 10% blood has also been used for primary iso- lation of B. pertussis. The bacterium does not grow on MacConkey medium, but other Bordetella species grow on this medium. Biochemical reactions B. pertussis shows the following biochemical reactions: It is oxidase positive and catalase positive but biochemically inert. The bacteria do not ferment carbohydrates. The bacteria also do not produce indole, do not reduce nitrate, do not split urea, and do not utilize citrate. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: B. pertussis is killed by heating at 55 \u00baC for 30 minutes. It is also killed by drying and also by standard disinfectants. If left on culture plates, the bacteria die within few days, but they can survive in dry droplets for up to 5 days and for 3 days on cloth. Chap-39.indd 330 5/14/2012 12:08:03 PMSection III Chapter 39BORDETELLA AND FRANCISELLA 331 Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Properties B. pertussis is a Gram-negative bacterium that possesses lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane. The LPS of B. pertussis is unusual. It is heterogenous with two distinct types of LPSs, lipid A and lipid X. Both lipid A and lipid X can acti-vate the alternative pathway of complement and stimulate the release of cytokines. The role of their unusual LPS in the patho-genesis of whooping cough is unknown. B. pertussis possesses two types of antigens. These are genus- specific somatic O antigen and strain-specific capsular K anti-gen. The O antigen is protein in nature, heat-stable, and is of single antigenic type. It is present in most of the strains of Bordetella. The K antigen is heat labile. These K antigens are of different types and are used for differentiating B. pertussis iso-lates in epidemiological studies. A total of 14 agglutinating factors or agglutinogens have been identified based on agglutinin absorption test. B. pertus-sis strains are classified into various types based on the pres-ence of agglutinogens on their capsule. Factor 7 is found in all strains of B. pertussis (1-7, 13), B. parapertussis (7-10, 14), and B. bronchiseptica (7-13). Pathogenesis and Immunity B. pertussis colonizes the cilia of mammalian respiratory epi-thelium. The organism usually does not invade the tissues. In addition, B. pertussis causes pertussis or whooping cough in two stages. The first stage is characterized by colonization, multiplication of bacteria, and production of localized tissue damage. The second stage of toxemia is characterized by mani-festation of systemic toxicity produced by a myriad of toxins. Virulence factors B. pertussis produces several virulence factors (Table 39-2). These include (a) filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), (b) pertussis toxin, (c) invasive adenylate cyclase, (d) lethal toxin, and (e) tra-cheal cytotoxin.Filamentous hemagglutinin: FHA is the most important virulence factor, which mediates the attachment of B. pertus-sis to the ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. It is a large protein (220 kDa) that forms filamentous structures on the cell surface. FHA binds to galactose residues on a sulfated glycolipid called sulfatide, present on the surface of the ciliated cells. This adhesin also binds to CR3, a receptor present on the surface of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The intracellular survival of the B. pertussis inside the leukocyte protects the bac-terium from humoral antibodies against FHA. Mutations in the FHA structural gene reduce the ability of B. pertussis to colonize. Recently, the structural gene for FHA has been cloned, thereby raising the possibility of the produc-tion for use in a vaccine.Pertussis toxin: Pertussis toxin is also involved in adhesion of B. pertussis to tracheal epithelium. Pertussis toxin is a 105 kDa protein; it is secreted into extracellular fluid and is also bound to the cell wall. Pertussis toxin typically composed of two major units A and B consists of six subunits S1, S2, S3, S5, and two S4 subunits. Unit A is enzymatically active moiety and consists of one toxic subunit S1. The unit B is responsible for binding of toxin to epithelial cells and consists of five binding subunits (S2, S3, S5, and two S4 subunits). The to glycolipid present the ciliated epithelium. The S3 subunit binds to ganglioside receptor on the surface of phagocytic cells. Antibodies against pertussis toxin component prevent coloni- zation of the ciliated cells by the bacteria and provide protection against B. pertussis infection. Hence, pertussis toxin is a major vir- ulent factor in the initial colonization of the bacteria. Following binding of the B subunit to the epithelial cells, the A subunit is inserted through the membrane and released into the cytoplasm. The A subunit by its enzymatic activity transfers the ADP ribosyl moiety of the NAD to the membrane-bound regulated protein G1, which normally inhibits the eukaryotic adenyl cyclase. The gene for pertussis toxin has been cloned and sequenced. The toxin is toxoided for use in the component adenylate cyclase or Invasive adenylate cyclase or hemolysin is a 45 kDa protein, which is bound to cell or is also released into the medium. It is a bifunctional toxin with an enzymatic component, i.e., adenylate cyclase activity, and a binding component that mediates attachment to the host cell surface. This toxin is produced by all three Bordetella species causing human infections. The adenylate cyclase was originally identified as hemolysin, because it causes lysis of Virulence factors Biological functions Filamentous hemagglutinin Binds to galactose residues on a sulfated glycolipid called sulfatide, present on the surface of the ciliated cells; binds to CR3, a receptor on the surface of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; and mediates the attachment of Bordetella pertussis to ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract Pertussis toxin Causes adhesion of Bordetella pertussis to tracheal epithelium; S2 S3 subunit binds to ganglioside on the and inhibits the cyclase or hemolysinIt has adenylate cyclase activity and a binding component that mediates attachment to host cell surface Lethal toxin Causes inflammation and lethal necrosis around the site of adherence of the bacteria Tracheal cytotoxin Kills ciliated respiratory cells; and ciliary PMSection III Chapter 39332 BACTERIOLOGY blood cells. This enzyme in fact is responsible for producing zone of hemolysis around B. pertussis colonies on blood agar.Lethal toxin: Lethal toxin was earlier known as dermone- crotic toxin. It is a heat-labile protein. It is a 102 kDa protein composed of four subunits: two with molecular weight of 24 kDa. The lethal toxin causes inflammation and lethal necro-sis around the site of adherence of B. pertussis. The toxin is lethal in high doses in experimental infection of mice. The role of the toxin in the disease is unknown.Tracheal cytotoxin: Tracheal cytotoxin is not a classical exo- toxin, because it is not composed of protein, but is composed of a low-molecular-weight peptidoglycan fragment that kills ciliated respiratory cells. It also stimulates release of cytokine IL-1 and is responsible for fever. Tracheal cytotoxin is toxic for ciliated respiratory epithelium and is responsible for inhibition of ciliary movement. The toxin specifically interferes with DNA synthesis, thereby preventing regeneration of damaged cells.Other factors: B. pertussis produces at least two other types of adhesins and pertactin, but their role in adherence and patho-genesis remains unknown. Pathogenesis of pertussis Infection with B. pertussis is initiated by attachment of the bacteria to ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. The attachment is mediated primarily by two bacterial adhesions, FHA and pertussis toxin. The bacteria multiply at the site of infection, where they produce several toxins that paralyze the tiny cilia and cause inflammation of the respiratory tract (Fig. 39-1). Pertussis toxin mediates both the colonization and tox- emic stage of the disease. The increase in the cyclic AMP levels results in increased respiratory secretions and mucus T racheal cytotoxin Ciliary movement Vasoconstriction Ischaemic necrosis Toxins B. attachment to ciliated epithelial cellsAdenylate cyclase toxin Phagocytosis of the bacteria is decreased Agglutinogens Attachment of bacteria to host cells promoted FIG. 39-1. Mechanisms of actions of various toxins produced by Bordetella per tussis.production, which characterizes the paroxysmal stage of whooping cough. The S1 subunit of pertussis toxin causes inflammation in the respiratory tract. Pertussis toxin plays an important role not only by mediating adherence to the ciliated epithelial cells but also by its enzymatic active unit, which con-tributes to the toxemic stage of the infection. The S2 subunit of the pertussis toxin binds to a glycolipid receptor on ciliated respiratory cells. Further bacterial adherence is mediated by FHA and subse- quent bacterial phagocytosis. Subsequently, many other toxins produced by B. pertussis also contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Adenylate cyclase toxin also inhibits leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing of the bacteria. Host immunity An attack of whooping cough gives lifelong immunity to a child. Secondary attack is extremely rare. The immunity is con-ferred by specific serum antibodies against B. pertussis. Clinical Syndromes B. pertussis causes whooping cough, the most common vaccine-preventable disease among children. Whooping cough Whooping cough is also known as pertussis. Incubation period varies from 7 to 10 days. The disease typically has three stages (Fig. 39-2): (a) catarrhal stage, (b) paroxysmal stage, and (c) con-valescent stage.Catarrhal stage: This is the first stage of whooping cough. This stage resembles that of upper respiratory tract infection with running nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, malaise, and Chap-39.indd 332 5/14/2012 12:08:04 PMSection Chapter 39BORDETELLA AND FRANCISELLA 333 occasional cough. A low-grade fever may also be seen. This phase typically lasts 1-2 weeks. This stage is highly infectious because of the production of large number of bacteria during this stage of the disease.Paroxysmal stage: This is the second stage of the disease. This stage is characterized by classic whooping cough or paroxysms. Each paroxysm consists of a series of repetitive intense and drawn out bouts of cough followed by an inspiratory whoop. The attack is more frequent at night with an average 15 attacks in a period of 24 hours. The paroxysm may end frequently with vomiting and exhaustion. During this stage, production of mucus in the respiratory tract is much frequent and is par-tially responsible for causing obstruction of the respiratory tract. Duration of this stage is highly variable, lasting within 1-6 weeks up to 10 weeks.Convalescent stage: This is the third stage of the disease, which may last for weeks or months. It is characterized by a chronic cough that becomes less paroxysmal. This stage is marked by many complications. These include subconjunc-tival hemorrhage, respiratory distress, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and neurological complications, such as convul-sions. These neurological complications may result in per-manent sequelae, such as epilepsy, paralysis, blindness, and deafness. Epidemiology Whooping cough is predominantly a disease of childhood. Geographical distribution Whooping cough is endemic worldwide and affects more than 600,000 million people annually. This is an important cause of mortality in children with estimated 51,000,000 cases and 600,000 deaths annually, particularly in the countries where vaccines are not used regularly.

Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Whooping cough is highly contagious. Humans are the only known reservoir of B. pertussis infection. An infected child, par-ticularly during catarrhal stage of disease, is the important source of infection. The infection is transmitted primarily by inhalation of air-borne droplets coughed out by the infected patients. The infection is also transmitted by contact with hard surfaces recently contaminated with respiratory secre-tions or droplets from an infected child. Secondary attack rates are highest (75-100%) among unimmunized household contacts. Initially, whooping cough was considered to be a disease of young children (/H110215 years), but now this disease is also seen in older children and adults. They contribute to 25% of cases of whooping cough. This is due to failing immunity over time in adults, even in those who are vaccinated. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Nasopharyngeal aspirates are the specimen of choice for dem-onstration of bacteria by microscopy and culture. These sam-ples should be collected during the first stage or early in the second stage of disease, because the organisms are most abun-dant in the respiratory secretions during these stages of dis-ease. Also, the specimen for culture should be collected before administration of antibiotics. The culture becomes negative 5 days after treatment with antibiotics. The specimens are usu-ally collected by using either calcium alginate or Dacron swabs but not by cotton swabs because the growth of bacteria is inhib-ited by certain fatty acids in the cotton, which are toxic to B. per-tussis. The specimens for culture are collected by the following methods: (a) the pernasal swab, (b) cough plate method, and (c) West's postnasal swab.The pernasal swab: In this method, a sterile swab on a flexible wire is passed gently along the floor of the nasal cavity, and the mucus and pus is collected by the swab.Cough plate method: In this method, specimens are directly coughed out by the patient on a culture medium, during a bout of spontaneous or induced coughing in an infected child. The culture plate is held 10-15 cm in front of the patient's mouth. During the process of coughing by children, infected nasopharyngeal secretions are directly deposited on the medium.West's postnasal swab: The collect posterior pharyngeal wall secretions through oral cavity. Contamination with saliva should be avoided for better results. The swab containing the mucus and pus is inoculated immediately on freshly prepared medium, such as Bordet-Gengou or charcoal horse blood agar, at the patient's bedside. In case of delay, they are transported in 0.2-0.5 mL casamino acid solution (pH 7.2) or in modified Stuart's transport medium or Regan-Lowe transport medium. Chap-39.indd 333 5/14/2012 12:08:04 PMSection III Chapter 39334 BACTERIOLOGY The transport media are transported immediately to labora-tory for processing, because even in these media the bacteria cannot survive for long time. Microscopy Microscopic diagnosis is made by a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) technique for demonstration of B. pertussis in respiratory secretions. In this method, a smear is made from a specimen on a glass slide, air dried, and heat fixed. This smear is then stained with fluorescent labeled antibody against B. pertussis . DFA is a rapid and sensitive method. This method is positive in more than 75% of cases of whooping cough. This technique, however, may show occasional positive reaction in other bacterial infections. Culture The specimens are cultured on freshly prepared Bordet-Gengou medium or charcoal horse blood agar medium and incubated in moist environment at 35\u00baC. Incubation even up to 7 days is required, because the colonies are observed only after 3 or more days of incubation. Identification of bacteria B. pertussis is identified by several characters (refer Box 39-1): 1. Small, round Gram-negative coccobacilli. 2. Demonstrates bisected pearl or mercury drop colonies on Bordet-Gengou agar . 3. Biochemically iner t, does not ferment carbohydrates. 4. Catalase and oxidase positive. 5. Bacteria demonstrated by direct fluorescent antibody testing.Box 39-1 Identifying features of Bordetella pertussis Serology Indirect hemagglutination and ELISA are frequently used to demonstrate IgG and IgA antibodies against FHA and IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin in the patient's sera. A significant rise in the titer of antibodies between acute and convalescent serum in paired sera samples by these tests is suggestive of recent infection. ELISA for demonstration of specific secretory IgA antibodies in nasopharyngeal secretions is also useful, especially in culture-negative cases. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new diagnostic method used for diagnosis of whooping cough. It shows a high sensi-tivity of 80-100%. However, this method is restricted to only a few laboratories. Treatment Erythromycin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline, chloram-phenicol, and ampicillin are also effective. These antibiotics are effective (a) in eradicating the bacteria from the respiratory tract and (b) in reducing the duration of infectivity of the patients. Treatment of pertussis is, however, primarily sup-ported by good nursing care. Prevention and Control Vaccination of infants and children with pertussis vaccine is very effective. The vaccination is usually given for children below 7 years of age. Vaccines Vaccines used against pertussis are of two types (refer to the box Vaccines): 1. Whole cell inactivated vaccine 2. Acellular vaccine Bordetella parapertussis B. parapertussis is a less frequent cause of whooping cough. The bacteria are responsible for only about 5% of cases of whooping cough. They relatively cause mild disease. B. parapertussis organ-isms differ from B. pertussis by their ability to grow on nutri-ent agar and to produce larger colonies, but the former do not produce pigment (Table 39-3). They are antigenically different from those of B. pertussis. Pertussis vaccine does not confer any protection against B. parapertussis.Vaccines Whole cell inactivated vaccine: This whooping cough vaccine has been used for the past five or more decades for protection among children against whooping cough. This vaccine is a merthiolate-killed bacterial cell suspension, which is administered as part of DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, and per-tussis) or triple vaccine. These vaccines are effective in 80-85% of population in eliminating asymptomatic pertussis. These vaccines are given in three doses intramuscularly at an interval of 4-6 weeks before the age of 6 months. This is fol-lowed by a booster at the end of first year. First dose is given at 6 weeks. Unfortunately, more than 20% of children who receive whole cell vaccines suffer from mild side effects. Convulsions occur on 0.1% of infants soon after receiving the vaccine. Encephalopathy may occur even in a very few number of cases. Acellular vaccines: Several new multicomponent acellu- lar vaccines have been developed from purified components of B. pertussis. The multicomponent vaccine contains FHA, pertussis toxin, fibrin agglutinin, and pertactin. These com-ponents are believed to confer protective immunity against whooping cough. This new acellular pertussis vaccine has been found to confer protective immunity similar to that conferred by whole cell vaccine, but the most important advantage is that these vaccines have very low side effects than the whole cell vaccines.- Chap-39.indd 334 5/14/2012 12:08:04 PMSection Bordetella bronchiseptica B. bronchiseptica is a motile bacterium by virtue of presence of peritrichate flagella. The bacteria grow on nutrient agar and are antigenically related to B. pertussis and Brucella abortus. It dif-fers from other Bordetella species in the biochemical and other properties (Table 39-3). B. bronchiseptica is responsible for caus- ing very small proportion (0.1%) of cases of whooping cough. Francisella tularensis F. tularensis causes tularemia, also known as glandular fever, rabbit fever, tick fever, and deerfly fever\u2014an acute, febrile, gran-ulomatous, infectious disease in humans and other mammals. Properties of the bacteria Morphology F. tularensis shows the following features: F. tularensis is a minute (0.2 /H11003 0.2 to 0.7 /H9262m) and poorly stained Gram-negative intracellular coccobacillus. The bacterium is capsulated and nonmotile. Like Mycoplasma organisms, this organism is filterable and multiplies, i.e., by filament formation and budding, besides binary fission. Culture Like Bordetella, the bacteria are strictly aerobic and fastidious, hence cannot be cultured on common laboratory media. The organism requires enriched media, such as Francis' blood dextrose cystine agar and a longer period of incubation of 3-5 days. F. tularensis produces minute transparent colonies on these media after incubation of 3-5 days. However, F. tularensis can grow on the chocolate agar if supplemented with cysteine and occasionally will grow on blood agar media. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: F. tularen- sis is killed by heating at 55 /H11034C for 30 minutes. It is also killed by drying and by standard disinfectants. Decontamination of inanimate objects by using 10% bleach followed by using 70% alcohol solution is effective. F. tularensis has two biovars: Jellison type A (F. tularen- sis biovar tularensis) and Jellison type B (F. tularensis biovar palaearctica). These are serologically similar, but differ primar-ily in their fermentation reactions, virulence, and geographical distribution. Jellison type A is more virulent and causes severe disease in humans. As few as 10 bacteria injected subcutaneously and 25 bacteria on inhalation can cause disease. This biovar is gen-erally found in North American rabbits and ticks. Jellison type B causes a milder form of disease in humans and is found pri-marily in Asian and European rodents. Pathogenesis and Immunity F. tularensis is one of the most infectious bacteria known. It is classified as a category A agent because of (i) its high infectivity, (ii) ease of dissemination, and (iii) ability to cause substantial illness and death. Humans become infected after introduction of the bacteria by intradermal injection, inhalation, or oral ingestion. Clinical manifestations of disease depend on the mode of infection. Intradermal injection or inhalations of 10-50 bacilli are required to cause disease. Nearly, 100 million bacteria are required to cause disease on oral ingestion. F. tularensis is an intracellular parasite. In infected animals, the bacteria are found in large numbers in the reticuloendothelial cells of spleen, liver, etc. These bacteria remain viable for a lon-ger period in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, because the organisms inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion. Like other Gram-negative bacilli, F. tularensis has endotoxin, but is relatively less biologically active than that found in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacilli. Capsulated strains of F. tularensis are pathogenic, strains are nonpathogenic. Clinical Syndromes F. tularensis III Chapter 39336 BACTERIOLOGY Tularemia The incubation period varies from 3 to 5 days. The onset of the disease is abrupt with symptoms, such as fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue. Tularemia can manifest in one to six well- recognized clinical forms. These include (a) ulceroglandular tularemia, (b) Epidemiology F. tularensis has a worldwide distribution. The infection is found in more than 100 species of animals, birds, amphibians, and arthropod hosts. The organism may also be found in mud and water. Geographical distribution Tularemia occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere except the United Kingdom. Cases have been reported in the former Soviet Union, Japan, Canada, Mexico, the United States, and Europe. The condition has not been described in either Africa or South America. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Rabbits, ticks, and muskrats are the reservoir of infections. Domestic cats are also now increasingly recognized as reser-voirs of tularemia. Ticks variabilis) are also important vectors and reservoirs due to the vertical transmission of their progeny. Contact with infected animals or their carcasses is the primary mode of transmission. The infection is transmitted by (a) ingestion of poorly cooked meats of the infected animals, such as rabbit, (b) ingestion of contaminated water, (c) bite of a tick or deerfly, (d) direct contact with contaminated soil, water, or fomites, and (e) inhalation of water aerosols or dust from soil, grains, or contaminated pelts. However, person-to-person transmission is rare. Laboratory Diagnosis F. tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium. Hence, isolation of the bacteria from clinical specimens is not attempted in rou-tine laboratories because culture poses a danger to laboratory workers. The plates must be sealed and handled by using a bio-safety level (BSL)-2 facility that is essential for handling the cul-ture plates and BSL-3 facility for isolation and identification of F. tularensis isolates. Specimens Sputum, pleural fluid, wounds, blood, lymph node biopsy samples, and gastric washings are the specimens collected for culture, but isolation rate is very low. CSF may show a mild elevation of protein concentration or pleocytosis. Microscopy Gram staining of the aspirates from ulcer exudates or from infected lymph nodes is not useful, because F. tularensis is extremely small and stains very faintly. Detection of antigen directly in clinical specimens by direct fluorescent antibody staining, using fluorescein-labeled antibodies directed against the organism, is more sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of the condition. The test is yet to be available for wide use. Culture Blood cultures in specific medium (such as cysteine-glucose-blood agar) are usually negative unless the cultures are incubated for a week or longer. Aspirates of lymph nodes or draining sinuses are usually positive if the cultures are incu-bated for 3 days or longer. The identification of F. tularensis is confirmed by testing with specific antiserum containing anti-bodies against Francisella. Serodiagnosis Diagnosis of tularemia is usually based on serology. Serodiagnosis depends on demonstration of serum anti-bodies by tularemia tube agglutination test and ELISA. Tularemia tube agglutination test is the most commonly used serological test. An agglutination titer greater than 1:160 is considered presumptively positive. Diagnosis is con-firmed by a fourfold increase in titer of the serum samples collected 2 weeks apart. The test shows cross-reactivity with Brucella species, Proteus Ox-19, Salmonella species, and Yersinia species. Capture ELISA using specific monoclonal antibodies raised against LPS of the virulent forms of F. tularensis is a sensitive method for detection of serum antigen. Molecular Diagnosis PCR has been used to detect F. tularensis in clinical specimens even after start of antibiotic therapy. The test is yet to be available as routine test. Treatment Streptomycin is the antibiotic of choice for treatment of tula-remia. Gentamicin is used as an alternative to streptomycin. Fluoroquinolones are now increasingly used in treatment of tularemia. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been used, but treatments with these bacteriostatic agents have been asso-ciated with high rate of relapse. 336 5/14/2012 12:08:05 PMSection III Chapter 39BORDETELLA AND FRANCISELLA 337 Prevention and Control Avoidance of exposure to tick bites and to dead or wild mammals, if possible, prevents the disease. Frequent and thorough hand washing is also useful. For vaccine refer the box Vaccines. Postexposure prophylaxis using tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, or doxycycline for 2 weeks is recommended within 24 hours of air-borne exposure. A 3-year-old child was brought to pediatric OPD with history of continuous dry cough for the past 15 days. On examina-tion, episodes of continuous violent coughing and a typical \"whoop\" were found. Peripheral blood smear showed leukocy-tosis. Chest X-ray was normal. Gram stain showed presence of oral commensals. Ziehl-Neelsen stain from gastric aspirate was negative for acid-fast bacteria. What is the likely diagnosis? What are the likely complications of this condition? How will you diagnose the condition in laboratory? Which is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of this case? What are the vaccines available for prevention of the condition?CASE STUDYVaccines A live attenuated vaccine obtained from avirulent F. tularensis biovar palaearctica (type B) is available. The vaccine confers only partial protection but reduces the severity of disease in vaccinated people. It is recommended only for those people who are repeatedly exposed to the pathogen, such as labora-tory workers, wild-animal is primarily a zoonotic infection caused by Brucella organisms infecting the domestic animals. The disease continues to be a major public health problem worldwide. The condition is known by various names, such as Malta fever, Mediterranean fever, undulant fever, etc. Brucella Classification The genus Brucella consists nonmotile, nonsporing, nontoxigenic, nonfermenting aerobic, and Gram-negative coccobacilli. The bacteria can grow on a variety of culture media including serum dextrose, blood, and chocolate agar. They are strict parasites of domestic and wild animals, but they can infect humans, which are accidental hosts. The genus Brucella consists of seven species, four of which are human These Brucella neotomae and Brucella ovis have not been described. Moreover, each Brucella species has a characteristic predilection to infect certain animal species where it causes chronic disease that persists for life. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Brucella shows the following features: Brucellae are Gram negative, but counterstain poorly and require relatively more time for staining. They are small coccobacilli, measuring 0.5-0.7 /H11003 0.6-1.5 /H9262m in size. These are arranged singly, sometimes in pairs, or in short chains. They do not produce spores, flagella, or capsule. Culture Brucellae are strict aerobes. Most biovars of B. abortus require 5-10% CO 2 for their growth. No growth occurs in aerobic condi- tions. They grow at a temperature range of 22-40\u00b0C (optimum temperature 37\u00b0C) and pH range of 6.6-7.4. Brucellae can grow on simple media, but their growth is slow and scanty. Growth is improved by addition of serum, blood, liver extract, and glucose. Brucella organisms grow best on trypticase soy based or other enriched media. Blood agar and trypticase soy agar are the media of dextrose agar are the other media also used for culture of Brucellae. Addition of bacitra-cin, polymyxin, and cycloheximide to these media makes them selective. On these solid media, Brucella spp. produce small, moist, translucent, and glistening colonies after 3 or more days of incubation. In liquid media, growth is uniform. Biochemical reactions Brucella species show following biochemical properties: Brucellae are catalase and oxidase positive (except for B. ovis and B. neotomae, which are oxidase negative). They reduce nitrate to nitrite and have variable urease activity\u2014B. suis becomes urease positive within 30 minutes, while B. abortus becomes positive within 1-2 hours. Some Brucella species produce H2S, while some species do not produce H2S. Citrate is not utilized. They do not produce indole and are MR and VP test negative. They do not ordinarily ferment any sugars. Brucella species and biovars are differentiated by following char-acteristics (Table 40-2): (a) growth in the presence of aniline dyes, such as basic fuchsin dyes or thionine; ( b) requirement for CO 2; ability to use glutamic acid, ornithine, lysine, and ribose; (d ) ability by antisera against specific lipopolysaccharide to by abortus consists seven and B. suis five biotypes. H2S-producing B. suis strains are called American strains, and those not producing H2S are called Danish strains.Brucella Bacteria Diseases Brucella abortus Mild with rare suppurative brucellosis with the reference of Brucella species. This phage lyses B. abortus both at routine test dilution (RTD) and at 10,000 RTD. The phage lyses B. suis at 10,000 RTD only, but does not lyse any strain of B. melitensis. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: The bru- cellae are rapidly killed at 60/H11034C in 10 minutes; hence they are killed by pasteurization in the milk. They are also killed by dis-infectants, such as 1% phenol in 15 minutes. They are sensitive to direct sunlight and acid. The bacteria survive for 10 days in refrigerated milk, for 1 month in ice cream, and for 4 months in butter. B. melitensis remains viable in urine for 6 days, in dust for 6 weeks, and in water or soil for 10 weeks. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Brucella like any other Gram-negative bacterium contains LPS in the outer cell membrane of the cell walls. But, the LPS of Brucella is different both structurally and functionally from that of other Gram-negative bacteria. The LPS of Brucella shows the following unique characteristics: 1. The lipid A part of the LPS contains 16-carbon long fatty acids but lacks the 14-carbon m yristic acid typical of lipid A of Enterobacteriaceae. 2. The polysaccharide O por tion of LPS contains an unusual sugar, 4,6-dideo xy-4-formamido-alpha- D-mannopyranoside, which is expressed either as homopolymer of alpha-1,2-linked sugars (A type) or as 3-alpha-1,2- and 2-alpha-1,3-linked sugars (M type). On the basis of these O polysaccharide linkages, somatic antigens of Brucella are classified into two major types: antigen A and antigen M. B. abortus has the highest concentration of A antigen (about 20 times as much as M antigen), while B. melitensis has the highest concentration of M antigen (about 20 times that of A antigen). B. suis has an intermediate antigenic pattern. Brucella species show antigenic cross-reaction with Salmonella of Brucella species are summarized in Table 40-3. Pathogenesis and Immunity Brucella species have predilection for intracellular growth, hence may be demonstrated inside phagocytes. Intracellular location of the Brucella explains the relative resistance of the bacterium to chemotherapy. Virulence factors LPS is the principle virulence factor of Brucella spp. Intracellular location of the bacteria makes them resistant to killing in serum and also by phagocytes (Table 40-4). Pathogenesis of brucellosis Brucellosis is a systemic disease in humans that can involve almost any organ system. They enter through ( a) abra- sion or cut in the skin, (b ) conjunctiva, (c ) respiratory tract, Species Animal reservoirBiotypes CO 2 requirementH2S requirementUrease 2 /H11002/H11002 and (d ) gastrointestinal tract. Shortly after gaining entry to the body, brucellae are rapidly ingested by polymorphonu-clear leukocytes, which are attracted to the site of inflamma-tion. But inside the leukocytes, the brucellae are not killed due to the presence of enzyme superoxide dismutase, O polysac-charide of LPS, and nucleotide-like substances produced by the bacteria. Brucellae that are not killed by leukocytes spread from the site of infection to the local lymph nodes which drain the site of infection. Inside the lymph glands, the bac-teria multiply and are released to the blood stream following rupture of the cells and are phagocytosed by the macrophages. Bacteria present in the macrophages are then carried to the organs of reticuloendothelial system, such as liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and kidney. In these organs, brucellae multiply in phagosomes of macrophages due to production of adenine and guanine monophosphate, which inhibits the phagolysosome fusion, oxidative burst activity, and tumor necrosis factor production. Apart from the organs of reticuloendothelial system, any other organ system (central nervous system, heart, joints, geni-tourinary system, pulmonary system, and skin) can be involved in brucellosis. Host immunity Immunity in brucellosis, like other obligate intracellular pathogens, is primarily cell-mediated immunity. Activated macrophages are primarily responsible for killing the bacteria by producing interferon gamma and other cytokines. It is sug-gested that antibody, complement, and macrophage-activating cytokines also play a supportive role in controlling multiplica-tion of extracellular bacteria or in early infection. The humoral immunity is characterized by production of antibodies against LPS of the bacteria. However, even in the presence of opsonic activity, these serum antibodies against LPS do not provide any protective immunity against bacteria. Clinical Syndromes Brucella species cause brucellosis. Clinical manifestations of brucellosis are protean in nature, and the course of disease is variable. The clinical manifestations of brucellosis depend on the infecting Brucella species. Of the four Brucella species caus-ing human infections, B. melitensis is the most virulent species. It causes the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis. It is also the most common cause of brucellosis. Because B. melitensis can survive in phagocytic cells and multiply in them, it produces a large number of bacteria. B. suis is associated with a prolonged course of illness often with suppurative, destructive lesions. B. abortus causes mild to moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with com-plications. B. canis infection is associated with an insidious onset, more relapses. This species usually do not cause chronic disease. Brucellosis The incubation period may range from 3 days to several weeks. Human infections may be of three types, as follows: (a) acute brucellosis, (b) chronic brucellosis, and (c) localized infection.Acute brucellosis: Acute brucellosis is seen in approximately 50% of patients infected with Brucella. Patients usually complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as anorexia, fatigue, weakness, malaise, or joint pain. Fever is an important symptom and is seen in almost all patients. The fever is intermittent and undu-lant (hence known as undulant fever) and can be associated with a relative bradycardia. In untreated patients with adverse disease, the patients can show respiratory tract symptoms (20%), bone and joint symptoms (20-60%), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms.Chronic brucellosis: This condition develops in incom- pletely treated patients. This condition is associated with a low-grade nonbacteremic infection with periodic serum againstLysis Brucella species Virulence factors Biological functions LPS Facilitates intracellular survival of the bacteria by inhibiting polymorphonuclear degranulation Intracellular location of the bacteriumMakes it resistant to killing in serum and also by phagocytesTABLE 40-4 Virulence factors of III Chapter 40BRUCELLA 341 Symptoms often last for 3-6 months and occasionally for a year or more.Localized infection: B. suis is more likely to cause localized and suppurative infection. Complications include infections of the heart, central nervous system (CNS), and the skin. Brucella endocarditis is the most dangerous complication and is responsible for 80% of deaths in brucellosis. Chronic meningoencephalitis is the usual manifestation of CNS infection. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Brucella infection is worldwide in distribution. The condition is endemic in certain Mediterranean countries. More than 500,000 cases of brucellosis are reported annually. Different Brucella species cause human infection in different geographical areas. B. melitensis is the major species causing human infection in India. In the United States, B. suis is the major species respon- sible for infection, whereas in Great Britain, B. abortus is the important species responsible for infection. Habitat Brucella species are primarily obligate intracellular pathogens of the reticuloendothelial system, such as lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Brucella species cause infection in a wide range of hosts, but these species show a high degree of host specificity. B. meliten-sis infects goats and sheep; B. abortus, cattle; B. suis, swines; and B. canis, dogs and foxes. The infected animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, buffalos, and swine are the important reservoirs of infections.The incidence of human disease is very closely related to the prevalence of infections in cattle, goats, and sheep. This is also related to activities that allow exposure of humans to poten-tially infected animals or their products. Human brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic bacterial infection. The infection is acquired always from animals directly or indirectly. Brucella organism is transmitted to humans by the following ways (Fig. 40-1): (a) ingestion, (b) direct contact, (c) inhalation, and (d) accidental inoculation.1. Ingestion: Brucellosis results primarily by drinking con-taminated unpasteurized milk or milk products. The infec-tion can also be transmitted by drinking water or eating raw vegetables contaminated with feces or urine of infected animals and also by eating meat of infected animals.2. Direct contact: The infection is acquired by direct contact with the infected materials of septic abortion of the animals or at the time of slaughter of animals. Brucella species present in the infected materials (placenta, fetuses, vaginal discharge, urine, or infected carcasses) enter the human host through the mucosa, conjunctiva, or skin.3. Inhalation: The infection is transmitted by inhalation of dust from wool or other dried material of infected animals. Infection by inhalation is important among veterinarians and laboratory workers.4. Accidental inoculation: Accidental inoculation is a serious risk in laboratory workers who handle culture of the organism. The incidence of infection in laboratory workers is reported in the countries of the Middle East and also in the United States, China, Peru, Mexico, and India. Laboratory Diagnosis Clinical diagnosis of brucellosis is very difficult due to protean manifestation of the disease. Hence, laboratory diagnosis plays an important role in confirming the diagnosis of brucellosis. Through ingestion of contaminated milk and milk products Rarely man to man transmissionThrough handling of animals like cows, pigs, and goats FIG. 40-1. Transmission of 40342 BACTERIOLOGY Specimens Blood is the specimen of choice and is collected for culture and for serological test. Bone marrow and sometimes synovial fluid and pleural fluid are also collected for culture. Specimens such as liver and lymph nodes can also be cultured for isolation of Brucella organisms. Rarely, the bacteria can be isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF ), urine, sputum, breast milk, vaginal discharge, and seminal fluid. Microscopy Gram staining is not useful for demonstration of Brucella organisms in clinical specimens due to their small size and intracellular location. Culture Isolation of Brucella from blood and other clinical speci-mens is the definitive diagnostic procedure in brucellosis. Approximately, 5-10 mL of blood is collected in the 200 mL serum dextrose broth or trypticase soy broth and incubated at 37/H11034C under 5-10% of CO 2. After fourth day of incubation, subcultures are made on solid media, every 3-5 days for 8 weeks before declaring the culture as negative. Key Points Castaneda's method of blood culture: A useful method to culture blood without the need for frequent subculture on solid medium, hence possibilities of contamination can be avoided. This biphasic medium contains both trypticase soy broth and solid trypticase soy agar slant in the same bottle (Fig. 40-2). The blood is inoculated onto the liquid broth, and bottle is incubated in the upright position. For subculture, one does not have to open the bottle; instead, the bottle is tilted so that liquid broth flows over the solid medium slant. It is again incubated in the upright position. In case of positive blood culture, colonies appear on the slant. The Castaneda's method of blood culture also reduces the risk of laboratory-acquired infection to both medical and paramedical staff. Sensitivity of blood cultures ranges from 30% to 50% depending on the Brucella species isolated. B. meli-tensis and B. suis are more likely to have detectable bacteremia and hence are readily cultured than B. abortus. Bone marrow cultures are more sensitive than blood culture. They typically are positive in the negative blood culture and serological results. Synovial fluid culture is positive in 50% of patients. Identification of bacteria Identification of Brucella colonies is made by microscopy of Gram-stained smears of the colonies, colony morphology, specific antibrucella sera (Box Serological tests are useful for diagnosis of subclinical bru-cellosis and for cases of acute and chronic brucellosis by demonstration of specific antibodies in patient's serum. Specific brucella antibodies, both IgG and IgM antibodies, appear in the serum 7-10 days after infection. IgM antibodies persist for up to 3 months after which these antibodies decline. Then IgG and IgA antibodies appear after 3 weeks of infection and persist for longer time. Hence, in acute stage or subclinical brucellosis, both IgG and IgM can be demonstrated; in chronic brucellosis, only IgG can be demonstrated, as IgM are absent. As IgG antibodies persist for many months or years, demon- stration of significant rise in the antibody titer is the definitive serological evidence of brucellosis. A fourfold increase in the titer or a single high antibody titer of 1:160 is the presumptive evidence of Brucella infection. B. abortus is used as an antigen in brucella agglutination tests because the antibodies against B. melitensis or B. suis can cross-react with B. abortus antigen. B. abortus antigen not only detects specific antibodies against its own antigens but also detects antibodies produced against B. melitensis and B. suis. However, antibodies against B. abortus do not react with B. canis. Hence, specific B. canis antigen is used to detect antibodies in the serum of patients infected with this organism. FIG. 40-2.

Agglutination with specific antibrucella sera. 7. Susceptibility A number of serological tests have been developed and tested in serodiagnosis of brucellosis. Common methods are (a) stan-dard tube agglutination tests, (b) indirect immunofluorescent immunosorbent This test remains the stan- dard method and is the most commonly used serological test for diagnosis of brucellosis. It detects the presence of antibodies against LPS component of Brucella. The test uses killed strains of B. abortus as antigen and is useful for diagnosis of brucellosis caused by B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis. This test is not use- ful for the infection caused by B. canis because this bacterium does not have O polysaccharide on its surface; hence it does not produce antibodies against LPS. The tube agglutination test is considered positive when anti- body titers are greater than or equal to 1 in 160 or when a four-fold rise titer is demonstrated in convalescent sera. Rise in titer is especially important in patients coming from endemic area in which titers of 1 in 160 are not unusual in persons who are asymptomatic.Modified tube agglutination test: In this test, 2-mercaptoetha-nol is added to the patient's sera before testing it. Addition of mercaptoethanol causes disruption of disulfide bond of IgM; hence only IgG is detected. This modified tube agglutination test is useful for specific detection of IgG antibodies, and titers higher than 1:80 are suggestive of active infection. A high IgG antibody titer or a titer that is higher after treatment suggests relapse or persistent infection. This test is useful for diagnosis of brucellosis during convalescence.Indirect immunofluorescent assay: It is a sensitive method for detection of brucella antibodies in the serum, which may be positive even in agglutination-test-negative cases.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: ELISA is the most sensitive test for detection of IgM, IgA, and IgG brucella antibodies during acute and chronic brucellosis. In this test, LPS-depleted cytoplasmic protein antigen of Brucella is used as antigen. Use of this antigen allows accurate evaluation of relapse of brucellosis in a patient because LPS antigenemia persists for a longer duration than does protein antigen. ELISA is extremely useful for diagnosis of neurobrucellosis by demonstration of brucella antibodies in the CSF. Nevertheless, these serological tests may show erroneous results due to the following factors: 1. Blocking antibodies: Blocking or nonagglutinating anti-bodies in the serum may contribute to a false positiv e result. This can be avoided by heating the serum at 55/H11034 C for 30 minutes or by using 4% saline or diluent in the test. These blocking antibodies can be diluted by adding antihu-man globulin to the antigen serum mixture (Coombs' test). 2. Prozone phenomenon: It is a frequent problem in diagnosis of brucellosis. This occurs due to high level of brucella anti- bodies in the serum, caused by hyperantigenemia. Prozone phenomenon gives rise to a false negative test. This can be avoided by routine dilution of serum to at least 1:320 because inhibition of agglutination may occur at low dilution. Cross-reactivity V. c holerae, Y. enterocolitica serotype O9, F. tularensis, and Salmonella species can cause false positive results due to the presence of cross-reacting LPS in these organisms. Cholera-induced antibodies may be removed by 2-mercaptoethanol absorption. 4. A decrease in titer is observed with recovery of patient. Brucella skin test : Brucella skin test is a delayed type of hyper- sensitivity reaction to brucella antigen. In this test, brucellin, a protein extract of the bacteria, is used as an antigen and is administered intradermally. The presence of erythema and indu-ration of 6 mm or more within 24 hours is suggestive of posi-tive reaction. This test is positive only in chronic brucellosis but negative in acute brucellosis. Repeated negative skin test excludes brucellosis. Molecular Diagnosis PCR has been evaluated for detection and rapid diagnosis of Brucella species. The test still remains at experimental stage. Other tests Bone marrow examination shows erythrophagocytosis, and CSF cultures for neurobrucellosis show pleocytosis, increased protein level, and hypoglycorrhea. Anemia in 75% of patients, thrombocytopenia in 40%, and pancytopenia in 6% of patients are other features. Laboratory diagnosis in animals The diagnosis of brucellosis in animals is based essentially on the same method as that employed for the diagnosis of human infections. In addition, culture of milk and urine from infected animals may give positive results. Rapid latex agglutination test and Rose Bengal card test are the rapid diagnostic methods, and are also used for diagnosis of brucellosis in cattle population.Milk ring test: This is a frequently used serological test for demonstration of antibodies in the milk of an animal. This is a screening test used to detect the presence of Brucella infec-tion in infected cattle. In this test, a concentrated suspension of killed B. abortus or B. melitensis stained with hematoxylin is used as antigen. This test is performed by adding a drop of colored brucella antigen to a sample of whole milk in a test tube. Then it is mixed, and mixed suspension is incubated in water bath at 70/H11034C for 40-50 minutes. In a positive test, if antibodies are present in the milk, the bacilli are agglutinated and raised with the cream to form a blue ring at the top, leaving the milk unstained. In a negative test, the milk remains uniformly blue without formation of any colored ring. Treatment Brucellae are sensitive to a number of oral antibiotics and ami-noglycosides. The combination of tetracycline PMSection III effective against most species of Brucella. Relapse is common on therapy with a single drug. So, the combination of antibiotics is recommended whenever possible. Combination of doxycy-cline with rifampin is effective. Doxycycline given in a dos-age of 200 mg/day orally with the addition of streptomycin in a dosage of 1 g/day given intramuscularly for 2-3 weeks is most effective for treatment of most forms of brucellosis in adults. Most of the patients respond to a 6-week course of therapy with a combination of rifampin and doxycycline given orally. Only less than 10% of patients show relapse. A dosage of doxy-cycline for 6 weeks with combination of streptomycin for the first 3 weeks is also effective. Relapse in brucellosis is due to inadequate therapy and not due to development of resistance to antibiotics.Prevention and Control Pasteurization or boiling of milk is most important to prevent transmission of brucellosis in humans, as most of the human infections are acquired by ingestion of contaminated milk and milk products. Also, use of protective clothing and gloves by per-sons handling or coming into close contact with animals prevents transmission of infection. For vaccination refer the box Vaccines. Vaccines Vaccination of animals is effective to control brucellosis in ani-mals. Live attenuated B. abortus vaccine containing B. abortus 1019 strain has been used successfully to prevent infection in cattle. Vaccines are not available against either B. suis or B. canis. No vaccine is available for humans. A 54-year-old male patient attended Medicine OPD, with a history of fever, headache, low back pain, joint pain for 1 month. History revealed that he was a shepherd by profession and was in habit of consuming unboiled milk. The patient was admitted and investigated thoroughly. WBC count was raised. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was raised; Widal test was negative. The serum was negative for HIV antibodies by ELISA. Peripheral blood smear for malaria parasite was negative. The blood culture yielded Brucella abortus. Diagnose the condition. What are the serological tests available for diagnosis of the condition? What are the reservoirs of the infection and how the infection is transmitted to humans? How will you treat the condition? Is there any vaccine against the disease for human use?CASE STUDY Chap-40.indd 344 5/14/2012 12:06:39 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 41 Introduction The genus included family Mycobac-teriaceae consists of nonmotile, non-spore-forming, and aero-bic bacilli. They are slightly curved rods, sometimes showing filamentous and branching forms. In liquid medium, they form mould-like pellicle; hence, the name Mycobacterium is derived from the word \"mould\" meaning fungus-like bacterium. The cell wall is thick, complex, and rich in lipids, which makes the surface hydrophobic. The lipid-rich cell wall also makes the bacteria resistant to commonly used disinfectants and lab-oratory staining reagents. Because of their lipid-rich waxy cell wall, mycobacteria are difficult to stain. But once stained, they resist decoloriza tion with acid solution and alcohol. They are, therefore, called acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Although they are Gram positive, they are difficult to stain, and they stain poorly with Gram stain. Most mycobacteria are slow growers, the generation time being 2-24 hours. These bacteria require 3-8 weeks of incuba-tion to produce demonstrable colonies on the solid media. Classification The genus Mycobacterium contains more than 70 species, many of which cause disease in humans. Mycobacterium species causing most human infections are summarized in Table 41-1. Mycobacterium leprae was the first species of the genus Mycobacterium to be identified by Hansen in 1874. Furthermore, Robert Koch in 1882 isolated the mammalian tubercle bacillus and established its role as a causative agent of tuberculosis, as it satisfied all the criteria of Koch's postulates. Subsequently, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated as the causative agent of tuberculosis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis Bacteria Diseases Mycobacterium leprae Leprosy Mycobacterium avium complex lymphadenopathy, disseminated Mycobacterium kansasii Opportunistic infections caused by most common Mycobacterium speciesMycobacterium tuberculosis complex is the term used cur- rently, which includes four species that can cause tuberculosis in humans and other mammals. These are: M. tuberculosis, the human type; Mycobacterium bovis, bovine type; Mycobacterium africanum, a species intermediate between human and bovine type and causing human tuberculosis mostly in tropical Africa; and Mycobacterium microti , another species which is pathogenic for goats and other small animals but does not cause any human infection. Saprophytic mycobacteria are the third group of mycobacterial species isolated from different types of sources. This species has been isolated from cold- and warm-blooded animals, from skin ulcers, and from environmental sources, such as soil and water. Originally, these saprophytic mycobacteria were called atypi-cal environmental or opportunistic mycobacteria, but these species are now designated as mycobacteria other than typical tubercle (MOTT ). This group of saprophytic mycobacteria are described in detail in Chapter 42. General Properties Members belonging to the genus Mycobacterium show the fol-lowing characteristics: They are acid fast. They contain mycolic acid, which consists of 60-90 carbons that are splitted to produce fatty acid methyl esters. They contain a high (61-71%) guanine and cytosine content in the DNA. The cell wall of Mycobacterium: The cell wall of Mycoba- cterium is complex. It is typical as that of Chap-41.indd 345 5/14/2012 12:20:53 PMSection III Chapter 41346 BACTERIOLOGY bacteria. It contains unique cytoplasmic membrane, surrounded by a thick peptidoglycan and a layer of highly antigenic mycolic acid. It is thick and lipid rich. The complex cell wall confers many properties to the bacteria. The mycolic acid consists of peptidoglycolipids, glycolipids, and lipids. These account for nearly 60% of dry weight of the cell wall. The outer layer con-sists of peptic chains and is an important antigen of the bac-teria, which induces cellular immunity in infected patients. A purified protein derivative (PPD) of this layer is used as a source of antigen in the skin test to demonstrate hypersensi-tive reaction of the host to M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis M. tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis\u2014number one infectious killer disease worldwide. Tuberculosis is most common in Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe. According to WHO, more than 8 million new cases of tuberculosis occur every year. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology M. tuberculosis shows following morphological features: M. tuberculosis organisms are straight or slightly curved rods occurring singly, in pairs, or in small clumps. They measure about 3 /H11003 0.3 /H9262m in size; sometimes long fila-mentous forms are also seen. M. bovis is usually shorter and stouter than M. tuberculosis. They are Gram positive but are difficult to stain. They stain poorly with Gram staining. They are nonmotile, nonsporing, and noncapsulated. Acid fastness of bacteria: M. tuberculosis is acid fast and alcohol fast; it resists decolorization by 20% sulfuric acid and absolute alcohol. This acid-fast staining is the most important property of the bacteria and is used widely for identification of the bacteria. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN)-staining procedure is used to demon- strate acid fastness of the bacteria. With this stain, M. tuberculosis stains bright red, while the tissue cells and other organisms are stained blue. These bacilli can also be stained by Auramine O stain and examined under a fluorescent microscope. They appear as bright fluorescent rods against a dark background. Much's granules are non-acid-fast form of tubercle bacilli demonstrated in the cold abscess pus, which when injected into susceptible animals could produce the disease. Culture M. tuberculosis is an obligate aerobe and characteristically grows very slowly in media. Optimum temperature is 37\u00b0C, and the bacteria do not grow below 25\u00b0C or above 40\u00b0C. Optimum pH is 6.4-7.0. M. bovis is microaerophilic on primary isolation, which subsequently becomes aerobic on subculture.M. tuberculosis is a slow-growing bacillus with an average generation time of 14-15 hours. Prolonged incubation is therefore necessary for demonstrating growth of the bacteria. The colonies usually appear in almost 2 weeks, but sometimes require incubation up to 8 weeks to appear. M. tuberculosis can grow on a wide range of enriched solid and liquid media.1. Culture on solid media: The examples of solid media are (i) egg-containing media (Lowenstein-Jensen [LJ] medium, Petragnani serum slope), or (iii) potato-based media (Pawlowsky medium). On these media, M. tuberculosis produces dry, rough, raised, and irregular colonies with a wrinkled surface. LJ medium: Of these media, LJ medium without starch is most widely used and is also recommended by the Interna-tional Union against Tuberculosis (IUAT). The LJ medium consists of coagulated whole egg, asparagines, malachite green, mineral salt, and glycerol or sodium pyruvate. Mala-chite green inhibits growth of bacteria other than myco-bacterium. Addition of 0.75% glycerol enhances growth of M. tuberculosis, but is inhibitory to growth of M. bovis. On the LJ medium after 6-8 weeks of incubation, M. tuberculosis pro- duces yellowish or buff-colored colonies. They are tenacious and not easily emulsified (Fig. 41-1). 2. Culture in liquid media: The commonly used liquid media include Soloac's solutions, Dubos medium, and Middlebrook's and Beck's medium. In liquid media, M. tuberculosis produces growth that appears first at the bottom and then grips up to the sides and produces a surface pellicle that may extend along the sides above the medium. The bacteria in Dubos medium containing Tween 80 produce a diffuse growth. In glycerol broth, they form a whitish wrinkled pellicle on the surface and a granular deposit at the bottom. Virulent strains usually form long serpentine cords in liquid media. In contrast, avirulent strains produce a relatively dispersed growth in the medium. The liquid media are not used for routine culture of the bacilli. FIG. 41-1. LJ media for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis : one medium showing colonies of M. tuberculosis , while the other medium showing no growth. Chap-41.indd 346 5/14/2012 12:20:55 PMSection III Chapter 41MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS 347 They are usually used for (i) preparation of mycobacterial antigens for vaccines and (ii) to assess antibiotic sensitivity of M. tuberculosis. Biochemical reactions M. tuberculosis shows the following biochemical properties: Niacin test is an important test to identify niacin-positive human strains of M. tuberculosis and differentiate them from niacin-negative M. bovis strains. M. tuberculosis human strains are niacin test positive. M. simiae and a few strains of M. chelonae are also niacin positive. They produce niacin as a metabolic by-product when grown on an egg-containing solid medium. M. tuberculosis is usually catalase positive. They lose their cat-alase activity when they become resistant to isoniazid (INH). Catalase-negative strains of M. tuberculosis are not virulent for guinea pigs. M. tuberculosis is amidase positive. It produces amidase enzymes, such as nicotinamidase and pyrazinamidase, which split various amide substrates. M. tuberculosis is positive for nitrate reduction test. It pro-duces the enzyme nitrate reductase, nitrate M. avium lack the enzyme nitroreduc-tase and therefore are negative for nitrate reduction test. M. tuberculosis as well as M. bovis are neutral red test positive. They have the property to bind neutral red in alkaline buffer solution. M. tuberculosis is arylsulfate test negative. Differential features of various strains of M. tuberculosis are summarized in Table 41-2. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Mycobacteria are killed by heating at 60\u00b0C for 15-20 minutes. Killing of the bacteria is dependent on the nature of the clinical speci-men in which the bacteria are present. Mycobacteria in the sputum may survive for 20-30 hours, but in dried sputum protected from the sunlight they may survive longer, up to 6 months. In droplet nuclei, they may remain alive for 8-10 days. Bacteria are killed when exposed to direct sunlight for 2 hours, but they remain viable at room temperature for 6-8 months.Tubercle bacilli are sensitive to formaldehyde and glutaral- dehyde. They are destroyed by tincture of iodine in 5 minutes and by 80% ethanol in 2-10 minutes. They are generally more resistant to chemical disinfectants than other nonspore-forming bacilli. They can survive exposure sodium hydroxide. M. tuberculosis is susceptible to pyrazinamide, while M. bovis and other mycobacteria are resistant. M. tuberculosis is resistant to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH), while M. bovis is susceptible. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The cell wall of M. tuberculosis consists of four layers\u2014(i) pepti-doglycan layer, (ii) arabinogalactan layer, (iii) mycolic acid layer, and (iv) mycosides. The peptidoglycan layer is the innermost layer covalently linked with arabinogalactan (polysaccharide) and its terminal ends are linked to mycolic acid. This layer is overlaid with polypeptides and a layer of mycolic acid consist-ing of free lipids, glycolipids, and peptidoglycolipids. These lip-ids constitute nearly 60% of the dry weight of the cell wall. The peptide chains present in the outer layer are impor- tant antigens, which stimulate cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in infected humans. PPDs are extracted and partially purified preparation of these proteins, which are used as antigens in tuberculosis skin test. The mycolic acid fraction of the lip-ids of the cell wall is responsible for many of the character-istic properties of the bacilli. These include (a) acid fastness, (b) slow growth by delaying permeation of nutrients, ( c) resis- tance to commonly used antibiotics, (d) resistance to deter-gents, (e) unusual resistance to killing by acids and alkalies, and (f) clumping or cord formation. Antigenic structure M. tuberculosis strains are antigenically homogenous. They are antigenically similar to M. bovis and M. microti but are distinct from other species. Mycobacteria possess two types of anti-gens: (a ) cell wall polysaccharide antigens and (b ) cytoplasmic soluble protein antigens. Group specificity is due to polysaccharides present in the cell wall. These include ara-binogalactans, lipoarabinomannan, and also lipids, glycolip-ids, and peptidoglycolipids. Type specificity is conferred by Properties Human Bovine Asian African Oxygen requirement Aerobic Microaerophilic Aerobic Microaerophilic Growth in thiophene-2-carboxylic reduction A, B, C A I ATABLE 41-2 Differential features of various strains of Mycobacterium 5/14/2012 the cytoplasmic protein antigens. These include antigen 5, antigen 6, antigen 14, antigen 19, antigen 33, antigen 38, and antigen 60. Key Points Mycobacteria protein (tuberculin) is responsible for devel-opment of delayed hypersensitivity in humans following infection by mycobacteria. Tuberculins from human, bovine, and murine bacilli are antigenically similar. Tuberculin also shows some antigenic relationship with that of atypical mycobacterium. Pathogenesis and Immunity M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis, a classic mycobacterial dis-ease in humans. The capability of M. tuberculosis for intracellu-lar growth in alveolar macrophages is the main determinant of virulence of the bacteria. Virulence factors The factors determining the virulence of M. tuberculosis are poorly understood. M. tuberculosis does not produce any toxin. Although cord factor and sulfolipids are toxic substances pro-duced by mycobacterium, their existence as virulence factors is doubtful.Cord factor: Cord factor was so called because of the false belief that it is responsible for producing serpentine cords typically found on the surface of liquid or on solid media by M. tuberculosis. The cord factor was originally thought to be a virulent factor, which no longer holds true.Sulfolipids: Sulfolipids are of doubtful virulence factor. Their exact role in pathogenesis of the disease is not known. They are found to be associated with virulence of tubercle bacilli by preventing fusion of phagosome and lysosome inside the mac-rophages, thereby allowing the bacteria to multiply within the macrophages. The main pathology in the infected tissue caused by mycobacterial infection is primarily due to responses of the host to M. tuberculosis infection rather than any virulence factor produced by it. Pathogenesis of tuberculosis Tuberculosis may be primary or postprimary depending on the time of infection and the type of host immune response.Primary tuberculosis: Primary tuberculosis represents the ini- tial infection caused by M. tuberculosis in an infected host. This condition is usually seen in young children in endemic countries like India. On inhalation of the aerosolized bacteria, the bacilli reach the lower respiratory tract. Majority of the inhaled bacteria are killed by the natural defensive mechanisms of the upper respi-ratory tract. The bacilli that survive these defensive mechanisms reach the lungs and enter alveolar macrophages. The phagocy-tosed bacilli inhibit acidification of the phagosomes and prevent subsequent fusion of phagosome and lysosome. This makes the bacteria multiply freely either in the phagosome or in the cyto-plasm. Multiplication inside the cells leads to destruction of the cells and release of mycobacteria. This is followed by further cycles of phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages, multiplica-tion of mycobacteria, and lysis of macrophages. Some bacilli are transported by macrophages to the hilar lymph nodes. They are attracted to this site by the presence of bacilli, cellular components, and chemotactic factors, such as complement C5a of the serum. This leads to formation of the focus known as Ghon's focus , which is formed of multinucleated giant cells known as Langerhans cells . The focus is commonly found in the lower lobe or in the lower part of the upper lobe of the lungs. This focus is also associated with enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes. Both Ghon focus and enlarged lymph nodes constitute the primary complex, which usually develops in 3-8 weeks after infection by tubercle bacilli. This primary com-plex is associated with the development of tuberculin hypersensi-tivity. The lesion in majority of cases heals spontaneously within 2-6 months. If small numbers of bacilli are present, the bacilli are destroyed by macrophages with minimal tissue damage. However, if many bacilli are present, it leads to development of tissue necrosis. Multiple host factors contribute to the process of tissue necrosis. These include (a ) local activation of the complement, (b) exposure to macrophage-derived hydrolytic enzymes, (c) cytokine toxicity, and (d ) reactive oxygen intermediates. The bacilli may be present as dormant in this stage or may become reactivated in old age, or following therapy, or follow-ing immunosuppressive disease. Reactivation of the tuberculosis: Postprimary tuber- culosis is caused of infection or by exogenous reinfection. Reactivation of primary lesion occurs more commonly in patients with decreased immunity, such as patients receiving transplants, those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and in the elderly patients. The secondary tuberculosis differs from primary tuberculosis in the following features: 1. Granulomas of secondary tuberculosis occur more com-monly in the upper lobes of the lung. The lesions in the lungs undergo caseous necrosis and tissue destruction, resulting in the formation of the ca vities in the immuno- deficient hosts. The lesions disseminate widely into lungs and other organs, such as kidneys, bones, meninges, etc. 2. Involvement of lymph nodes is usual. 3. The cavities may rupture into blood vessels, causing dis-semination of my cobacteria in the body or these may rup- ture into airways, releasing mycobacterium in aerosol and sputum. Tubercle: Tubercle is the key pathology in tuberculosis. This is an avascular granulomatous condition. It is com-posed of a peripheral zone of lymphocytes and fibroblasts and a central zone consisting of giant cells with or without caseation. The lesions are mainly of two types: (a) exudative and (b) productive tubercular lesions. Chap-41.indd tuberculous lesion is an acute inflammatory reac-tion. This condition is associated with an increase in the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and subsequently with that of lymphocytes and mononuclear cells as well as accumulation of fluid. This lesion is seen more commonly in patients (i) infected with more virulent bacilli, (ii) with an increased load of bacilli, and (iii) with increased delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) host response. Productive tuberculosis lesion is primarily cellular. It is associ-ated with protective immunity rather than DTH response. Host immunity M. tuberculosis infection in an infected host induces CMI. The CMI is manifested either as delayed tuberculin hyper-sensitivity or as resistance to infection. The course of infec-tion is determined by the interaction of hypersensitivity or immunity.Tuberculin hypersensitivity reaction: This was first described by Robert Koch in experimentally infected animals, such as guinea pigs. Demonstration of this tuberculin reactivity in guinea pigs is known as Koch's phenomenon. Koch phenome-non is demonstrated by subcutaneous injection of pure culture of virulent tubercle bacilli in a normal guinea pig. Initially, no immediate visible reaction is observed at the site of inoculation in the guinea pigs. But after 10-14 days, a hard nodule appears at the site of inoculation, which soon breaks down to from an ulcer that persists till the animal dies of progressive tubercu-losis. The regional lymph nodes draining the region become enlarged and caseous. In contrast, when a guinea pig already inoculated 4-6 weeks earlier by tubercle bacilli is injected with tubercle bacilli, an individual lesion develops at the site of second inoculation within 24-48 hours. The lesion undergoes necrosis in another day to produce a shallow ulcer that heals rapidly, involving the regional lymph nodes and other tissues. Key Points The Koch's phenomenon is a combination of both hypersensitivity and immunity, which has three components: Local reaction (induration and necrosis), A focal response (congestion and even hemorrhage around tuberculous foci), and A systemic response (fever), which may even be fatal. The DTH can be induced by live attenuated and killed bacilli, bacillary products, and tubercular protein. Usually live or killed bacilli or tubercular protein (tuberculin) are employed for demonstration of hypersensitivity reaction. This hypersen-sitivity reaction can be transferred passively by cells, but not by serum. Tuberculin test: Tuberculin test is performed to demonstrate delayed type IV or cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to tubercle bacilli. Originally, the tuberculin test was performed by using a protein known as old tuberculin (OT) prepared by Robert Koch.The OT is a protein component of tubercle bacilli prepared from a 6-8 week culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis cultured in 5% glycerol, which is concentrated 10-fold by evaporation on a steam bath. The OT is a crude protein, which consists of pro-tein as a constituent but varies from batch to batch in its purity and potency. This has now been replaced by the use of PPD of tubercle bacilli.Humoral immunity: Humoral immunity is characterized by the development of antibodies in serum, but they do not play any role in conferring immunity against the bacteria. Antibodies against polysaccharide, proteins, and phosphate antigens of tubercle bacilli have been demonstrated in serum of patients with tuberculosis. These serum antibodies, however, are not protective. Clinical Syndromes The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis depend on the site of infection. However, primary infection is usually pulmonary. M. tuberculosis produces following clinical syndromes: (a) pul-monary tuberculosis and (b) extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis Productive cough, fever, and weight loss are typical symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Hemoptysis or chest pain, night sweats, fatigue, and anorexia are the other systemic manifes-tations. The sputum may be scanty or bloody and purulent and, as a result, is usually associated with cavitary lesions in the lung. Pulmonary tuberculosis may manifest in various forms including progressive pulmonary disease, involvement of pleura, and reactivated pulmonary disease. Pulmonary com-plications bron-cholithiasis, and fibrothorax. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Extrapulmonary tuberculosis usually occurs as a result of spread of the bacilli through blood circulation during the initial stage of multiplication at the site of primary infection, i.e., lung. Depending on the site of infection, extrapulmonary infections may be: (a conditions.Genitourinary tuberculosis: Genitourinary tuberculosis is one of the most common extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis. The typical symptoms include dysuria, increased frequency of urination, and flank pain. The condition in men may manifest as epididymitis or a growth in the scrotal area. In women, the condition may manifest as pelvic inflammatory disease. Genitourinary tuberculosis is responsible for approxi-mately 10% of sterility in women.Tubercular meningitis: This is one of the most severe com- plications of tuberculosis. The condition may persist as head-ache, which is either intermittent or persistent. Chap-41.indd PMSection III Chapter 41350 BACTERIOLOGY Gastrointestinal tuberculosis: The clinical manifestation of the condition depends on the site affected in the gastrointes-tinal tract. For example, infection of stomach or duodenum manifests as abdominal pain mimicking peptic ulcer disease, whereas infection of large intestine manifests as pain in abdo-men, diarrhea, etc.Skeletal tuberculosis: Spine is the most common site involved in skeletal tuberculosis resulting in Pott's disease.Tubercular lymphadenitis: Tubercular lymphadenitis or scrofula most commonly involves the neck along the sterno-cleidomastoid muscle. The condition is usually unilateral, with little or no pain.Other conditions: These include miliary tuberculosis, tuber- culosis of the skin, and tuberculosis of the middle ear and ocu-lar structures. Complications of Tuberculosis Miliary disease, disseminated tuberculosis, and tubercular meningitis are the most serious complications of primary tuberculosis. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax are the noted pulmonary complications of tuberculosis. Intestinal perfora-tion, obstruction and malabsorption are the complications of tuberculosis of small intestine. Hydronephrosis and autone-phrectomy are the renal complications, whereas paraplegia is the complication of Pott's disease of the spine. Tuberculosis with HIV HIV patients with tuberculosis are more likely to progress to disseminated disease. These patients usually do not have cavi-tary pulmonary disease or upper lobe infiltrates in the lung. Patients with tuberculosis should be tested for HIV and those with HIV need to be tested periodically for tuberculosis by tuberculin skin test and chest radiography. HIV patients with a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) usually develop active tuber-culosis at a rate of 3-16% per year. HIV reactivates latent tuberculosis infection, makes the disease more serious, and renders treatment ineffective. The patients with both HIV and tuberculosis on treatment with antiretroviral therapy develop various clinical manifestations, which include fever, lymphadenopathy, and noninvasive pul-monary infiltrates. This has been suggested due to a stronger immune response to M. tuberculosis. Epidemiology Tuberculosis is the number one infectious killer disease worldwide. Geographical distribution One-third of the world population is infected with M. tuberculosis. Nearly, two-thirds of all cases of tuberculosis occur in the devel-oping countries including India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Congo. Nearly, 3 million people die of tuberculosis every year and nearly 2 billion people have latent tuberculosis.Tuberculosis is a major health problem in India. More than 40% of the population is infected with M. tuberculosis, and nearly 15 million people suffer from tuberculosis of which 3 million people are highly infectious open cases of tubercu-losis. Nearly half a million people die from the disease every year. Habitat M. tuberculosis inhabits primarily the respiratory tract of the infected human host. The droplet nuclei consisting of M. tuberculosis have been found in the terminal air spaces of the lung. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Human beings are the only source and reservoir for M. tuberculosis infection. The infectiousness of the source is of primary importance, which determines the possibility of trans-mission of the disease. This depends on bacillary load of lesions and also on the morphology of the lesion. Lesions with cavities have 100-10,000 bacilli; therefore, cases with cavitary lesions are potentially highly infectious. Cases treated with antituber-cular therapy are less infectious than those who are not treated with any antitubercular drugs. The decrease in infectiousness is primarily due to reduction in the bacillary load in the lungs. Humans acquire M. tuberculosis infection most frequently by inhalation of infectious aerosolized droplets. These infective droplets are usually coughed or sneezed into environment by a patient suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The acts of coughing, sneezing, and speaking release a large number of droplets containing as many as 3000 infectious airborne drop-let nuclei per cough. The droplet nucleus is small, measures 5 /H9262m or less, and may contain approximately 1-10 tubercle bacilli. Theoretically, although a single tubercle bacillus may cause disease, in practice 5-200 inhaled bacilli are essential for infection. These droplets by virtue of their small size remain suspended in the air for a very long period of time. The infec-tion is acquired rarely by inoculation. M. bovis infection is transmitted to humans by ingestion of raw milk of the cows infected with M. bovis. The infection among animals is spread by aerosolized bacilli in moist cough sprays. The infected animals usually excrete the bacilli in their milk. Person-to-person transmission of M. bovis usually does not occur.Risk factors for tuberculosis: Primary infection of lung occurs as a result of inhalation of the infectious aerosols. The risk of infection depends on the exposure to ultraviolet rays and ventilation; therefore the risk of infection is high in small rooms and in rooms with poor ventilation. There are many risk factors for tuberculosis: HIV is one of the most important risk factor. Case rates for individuals who are infected with both HIV and M. tuberculo- sis exceed the infective risk of individuals with M. tuberculosis infection who are not infected with HIV. Chap-41.indd 350 5/14/2012 12:20:55 PMSection III Chapter 41MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS 351 Other factors that increase the risk of tuberculosis are ste-roid therapy, cancer chemotherapy, malignancies, and undernutrition. The latter condition alters CMI and, there-fore, is responsible for the increased frequency of tuberculo-sis in impoverished persons. Persons with certain human leukocytic antigen (HLA types) are at increased susceptibility to acquisition of tuberculosis. Hereditary factors, such as presence of a Bcg gene, also have a predisposition to tuberculosis. Nontubercular factors, such as pertussis, varicella, and mea-sles, may reactivate dormant and quiescent M. tuberculosis infection. Infection in mammals: M. tuberculosis primarily causes natu- ral infections in humans. The bacteria may also cause natural infections in other primates, dogs, and other animals, which come in close contact with infected humans. In experimental infections, M. tuberculosis is highly infectious for guinea pigs and hamsters but is usually nonpathogenic for bovines, goats, cats, and rabbits. Mice are moderately susceptible. M. bovis is more pathogenic for animals. The bacilli produce tuberculosis in cattle as well as in humans and other primates. Experimentally it is highly pathogenic for guinea pigs, calves, and rats and non-pathogenic for fowl. African strains or M. africanum are the strains of tubercle bacilli that are isolated mostly from Africa. Asian type strains are of low virulence for guinea pigs, susceptible to hydro-gen peroxide, resistant to INH, and are usually isolated from South India. These Asian strains have also been isolated from other Asian countries and from Asians abroad. Differential features of various strains of M. tuberculosis are summarized in Table 41-2. Laboratory Diagnosis The clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis is supported by labora-tory diagnosis and other tests including radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease. Definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis is made by detection of M. tuberculosis from clinical specimens by microscopy or culture. Specimen Collection of the specimen depends on the nature of the infection whether pulmonary or extrapulmonary. Sputum, lung tissue, gastric lavage, and bronchoalveolar lavage are the specimens collected for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, urine, lymph node tissue, bone marrow and blood are the other specimens frequently used in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In general, few tubercle bacilli are present in extra-pulmonary specimens than in sputum. 1. Sputum is the specimen of choice for pulmonary tuber culosis. Sputum, not saliva, is collected in the morn- ing into a clean wide-mouthed container, such as sputum cup. Collection of morning sputum specimen is ideal. If sputum is scanty, 24-hour specimen may be collected. Sputum specimen collected on three consecutive days increases the chance of detection of tubercle bacilli. 2. Gastric aspirate may be used in place of sputum, especially in young children who canno t produce the sputum. In older children, bronchial secretions may be collected by stimulation of the cough by using an aerosol solution of propylene glycol in 10% sodium chloride. Bronchoalveolar lavage may also be used for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. 3. Urine is the specimen of choice for diagnosis of genito-urinary tuber culosis. This is collected either as three con- secutive early morning samples or as a single sample of completely voided urine in 24 hours. The urine specimens are collected in large, clean, ster- ile containers of 500 mL or more capacity and sent to the laboratory for processing. The urine specimens are centri-fuged at 300 rpm for 30 minutes, and the sediments are used for culture on selective media for M. tuberculosis. 4. CSF is collected for diagnosis of tubercular meningitis. The CSF is centrifuged and the sediment after centrif-ugation is st ained for smears and is inoculated on the media for culture. CSF on standing for a long time devel-ops a spider web, the examination of which shows more bacilli. 5. Pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and other exudates are col-lected in containers with citrate to prev ent coagulation. Bone marrow and liver tissue are usually collected from patients with miliary tuberculosis, and blood is collected from patients with HIV for isolation of bacteria by culture. It is essential to collect all these specimens before starting antitubercular therapy. The specimens after collection should be transported as immediately as possible for staining and cul-ture. In case of delay, the specimens are refrigerated at 4\u00b0C, but not more than overnight. Further delay in processing decreases the possibility of isolation of tubercle bacilli by culture. Microscopy Sputum microscopy is the most dependable and conventional method for demonstration of AFB by ZN staining method. The sputum smears are made by using new slides every time. The slides should not be reused, because AFB may adhere to the sur-face of the slide and may not be removed from the slide during the process of cleaning. The smears are made from thick purulent part of the sputum and then are air dried, fixed by heating, and finally stained by ZN technique. The stained smear is examined under oil immer-sion lens (100 /H11003). Acid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright red against a blue background. At least 50,000 to 1 lakh bacilli should be present per milliliter of sputum in order to be examined, taking about 10 minutes before giving negative report. The presence of at least two or more typical bacilli in the smear is reported as positive for AFB (Fig. 41-2, Color Photo 41). The smears are graded depending on the number of tuber- cle bacilli present in a stained smear on examination by oil immersion lens. Chap-41.indd 351 Smear is useful: in a quantitative assessment of the number of bacilli in the sputum (Table 41-3); to estimate the infectiousness of the patient; to monitor the effectiveness of antimycobacterial therapy; and to determine the discontinuation of respiratory isolation. Microscopic demonstration of AFB in stained smears is the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis. This is because ZN staining of AFB smears cannot be used to differentiate M. tuberculosis from other acid-fast organisms, such as sapro-phytic mycobacteria or Nocardia species. Saprophytic mycobacteria may present appearance simi- lar to that of M. tuberculosis. But nevertheless saprophytic mycobacteria stain uniformly without any barred or beaded appearance and are usually only acid fast but not alcohol fast. Moreover, these saprophytic mycobacteria are usually not present in the sputum and other respiratory secretions but are found in urogenital specimens, gastric aspirates, and fecal specimens. Auramine-rhodamine stains are the fluorescent stains that are used as variation of the traditional ZN stain for demonstra-tion of AFB. In this method, the smears are stained with aura-mine-rhodamine or auramine-phenol fluorescent dyes and are examined by fluorescent microscope under ultraviolet illumi-nation. These AFB appear as bright fluorescing rods against a dark background. The bacilli, because of their contrast, are visualized even under a high power objective in contrast to oil immersion objective in ZN stain, thus enabling rapid screen-ing of the larger areas of the smear. These fluorescent-stained slides can be screened faster, because the AFB stand out against the nonfluorescent background. This is the major advantage of this staining method, hence is adopted in the laboratories where many smears are to be examined for AFB. However, it is always essential to confirm fluorochrome-positive smears by ZN staining.The sputum microscopy may be negative in the early stage of the disease or in children in whom bacilli in respiratory secre-tions are few. Concentration of specimens Concentration methods have been described for concentra-tion of mycobacteria in sputum and other specimens. By these methods, specimens are decontaminated and concentrated into a small volume without inactivation of the bacteria. The concentrated sediments are used for microscopy as well as for culture and animal inoculation. Several methods are now in use and include the following:Petroff's method: It is a simple and widely used method. In this method, equal volume of sputum and 4% sodium hydrox-ide solution are mixed and incubated at 37\u00b0C with frequent shaking till it becomes clear, on an average for 20 minutes. It is then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes. The super-natant is discarded, and the sediment is neutralized by adding 8% hydrochloric acid. Phenol red is used as indicator.Other methods: Other methods of concentration are avail- able, which use dilute acids (6% sulfuric and pancreatin, deso-gen, zephiran, and cetrimide) for concentration of specimens. Culture Culture is the definitive method to detect and identify M. tuberculosis. The culture is also more sensitive diagnostic method than microscopy of the smear. The culture may be pos-itive with as few as 10-100 AFB per mm of a digested concen-trated specimen. Another advantage of culture is that it helps in specific species identification and for determining drug sus-ceptibility pattern of isolated strains. LJ medium is an egg-based medium and the Middlebrook 7H10 and 7H11 media are the agar-based media, and these are conventionally used for culture. Since M. tuberculosis is a slow-growing organism, a period of 6-8 weeks is required for colonies to appear on these conventional culture media after incubation at 37\u00b0C. Growth of most strains of M. tuberculosis may appear during this period. However, cultures should not be discarded as negative until they have been observed for 12 weeks. Acid fast bacilli FIG. 41-2.

M. tuberculosis is weakly catalase positive, nitrate positive, reduces niacin, and grows slowly over a period of 4-6 weeks (Box 41-1). Differences between M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are summarized in Table 41-4.Niacin test: This test is performed by adding 1 mL of sterile normal saline to colonies of M. tuberculosis in LJ medium. The medium is kept in a slanting position so that the colonies of mycobacterium are completely covered by normal saline. After sometime, 0.5 mL of the fluid is collected and is placed in a clean screw-capped test tube. To this fluid, 0.5 mL of alcoholic aniline as well as 0.5 mL of 10% cyanogen bromide is added. In a positive test, a yellow color develops in the solution within a few minutes. M. tuberculosis is niacin test negative. It does not produce any yellow color in the fluid.Arylsulfatase test: This test is performed by culturing mycobacteria medium containing 0.001 tripotassium phenolphthalein disulfate. The free phenol-phthalein is detected by adding 2N sodium hydro xide to the culture. Development of pink color indicates positive reac-tion. M. tuberculosis is arylsulfatase negative, while some other Mycobacterium species are arylsulfatase positive.Neutral red test: This test is carried out to detect ability of certain strains of mycobacteria to bind neutral red in an alka-line buffer solution. In this test, one to two colonies of myco-bacteria grown on LJ medium are inoculated with 5 mL of ethyl alcohol collected in a screw-capped bottle. This bottle after inoculation is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Supernatant alcohol is then removed carefully and transferred to another bottle to which 5 mL of distilled water and 0.2 mL of 0.05% aqueous solution of neutral red are added. Then N/100 sodium hydroxide is added drop by drop till the color of the fluid becomes amber. The bottle is reincubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in water bath with frequent shaking. The development of pink or red stained colonies in the amber-colored fluid sug-gests a positive test. M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are neutral red test positive.Catalase test: This test is performed to detect the enzyme catalase produced by various Mycobacterium species. This test is performed by mixing equal volumes of 30% hydrogen per-oxide and 10% of Tween 80 in a test tube. Then a few colonies of mycobacteria are picked up by a nichrome wire loop and are inoculated in the fluid. Formation of air bubbles in the fluid is observed within 1 minute. Demonstration of bubbles in the fluid indicates positive test (Fig. 41-3, Color Photo 42). If the bubbles appear in the fluid immediately, it is considered strongly positive, but if appear slowly, it is considered weakly positive. Absence of any bubble is considered as negative test. M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are weakly catalase positive. The bacilli lose their catalase activity when they develop resistance to INH.Amidase test: This test detects the ability of certain mycobac- teria to split amides, such as acetamide, nicotinamide, pyrazin-amide, carbamide, and benzamide. This is performed by Character Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mycobacterium bovis Microscopy Slender or slightly curved rods with barred or beaded appearanceStraight, stout, short, and uniformly stained rods Oxygen requirement Obligate aerobe Microaerophilic on primary isolation but becomes aerobic on subculture Days for appearance of colonies at 37\u00b0C 12-25 days (eugonic growth) 20-40 days (dysgonic growth) Effect of glycerol (0.75%) Enhances the growth Inhibits the growth Colony White to buff colored, rough, and tough colonies White, moist, smooth, flat, and friable colonies Nitrate reduction /H11001/H11002 Niacin production /H11001/H11002 Differential features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis 1.

Luxuriant eugonic growth. 4. Weakly catalase positive. 5. Neutral red test positive. 6. Amidase positive. 7. Nitrate reduction test positive. 8. Pyrazinamidase test positive. 9. Niacin test negative. 10. Arylsulfatase negative. 11. Sensitive to 50 mg/mL pyrazinamide.Box 41-1 of the amide with the myco-bacterial culture at 37\u00b0C. Then 0.1 mL of manganese sulfate, 1 mL of phenol solution, and 0.5 mL of hypochlorite solution are added to the solution. The tubes are then kept in boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Positive test is indicated by the develop-ment of blue color in the fluid. M. tuberculosis is amidase posi-tive, produces the enzyme nicotinamidase and pyrazinamidase.Nitrate reduction test detects the presence of enzyme nitrate reductase produced by M. tuberculosis and other Mycobacterium species. It is performed by adding col- onies of the mycobacteria to buffered solution containing nitrate and incubating at 37\u00b0C 2 hours. After incubation, sulfanilamide and N-naphthyl-ethylene diamine hydrochlo- ride solution is added. Development of pink or red color within 30-60 seconds is suggestive of a positive test. M. tuber-culosis and other mycobacterial species are nitrate reductase test positive, whereas M. bovis and M. avium are negative.Tween 80 hydrolysis: This test is performed to demonstrate the enzyme lipase produced by certain mycobacterial species. It is carried out by adding a loopful of mycobacterium culture to a solution containing Tween 80, buffer, and neutral red. The inoculated medium is inactivated at 37\u00b0C, and the reaction is observed first at 3-6 hours, then at third day, and thereafter daily up to a period of 10 days. Development of pink color indi-cates positive Tween 80 hydrolysis test. M. tuberculosis shows a variable result. M. kansasii produces a positive test within 3-6 hours, while other mycobacteria species produce positive test within 3-10 days.NAP differentiation test: This test is based on the principle that addition of p-nitro acetyl-amino-hydroxyl-propionophe-none (NAP) inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis as well as M. bovis and M. africanum. This substance does not inhibit growth of other Mycobacterium species.DNA probe: Nucleic acid hybridization using DNA probes is increasingly used to identify the species. These commercially available probes help in the identification of M. tuberculosis complex much earlier. The DNA probes show a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, when at least 100,000 tubercle bacilli are present. This test uses chemiluminescent ester-labeled single-stranded DNA probes. The chemiluminescence is determined by using luminometer. Positive DNA probe test indicates the mycobacteria to be M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or M. africanum. The probe cannot differentiate between these species. Niacin pro-duction, nitrate reduction, and production of pyrazinamidases are useful tests to differentiate M. tuberculosis from M. bovis (Table 41-4).Pyrazinamide test: M. tuberculosis is sensitive to 50 /H9262g/mL pyrazinamide and is pyrazinamidase test positive. M. bovis is pyrazinamidase test negative.TCH susceptibility test: M. tuberculosis is resistant to 10 /H9262g/mL of TCH, while M. bovis is susceptible to TCH. Mycobacteria drug susceptibility testing With the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) myco-bacteria, determination of drug susceptibility testing is impor-tant for starting appropriate treatment. Drug susceptibility can be demonstrated by both ( a) phenotypic susceptibility assays and (b) genotypic methods. Phenotypic assay methods include (i) resistance ratio method, (ii) absolute concentration method, (iii) proportion method, and (iv) radiometric methods. Genotypic methods include (i) DNA sequencing, (ii) solid phase hybridization, and (iii) polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR)\u2014single-stranded combination polymorphism analysis. Serodiagnosis M. tuberculosis infection is associated with elevated levels of antibodies in the serum. Various mycobacterial antigens have been used in these serological tests, which include BCG, 5 and 6 kDa proteins of M. tuberculosis, 32 and 64 kDa protein of M. bovis, etc. Detection of antibodies by serological test, such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is of limited value in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Latex agglu-tination test using latex particles coated with rabbit antibody against M. tuberculosis has been used for demonstration of anti- gen in the CSF for diagnosis of tuberculosis meningitis. Animal inoculation Guinea pig inoculation is carried out by intramuscular inocu-lation of concentrated clinical specimens into thighs of two 12 weeks' old healthy guinea pigs. Development of infection is suggested by a progressive loss of weight and development of a positive tuberculin skin reaction. One of the two animals is sacrificed after 4 weeks. In a positive infection, the autopsy of the animal shows a caseous lesion at the site of inoculation. At times, the local cutaneous lesion may be associated with formation of pus at FIG. 41-3. Semiquantitative catalase test. Chap-41.indd 354 5/14/2012 12:20:56 PMSection III 41MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS 355 the site of the cutaneous lesion and enlarged caseous lymph nodes draining the region. Spleen, liver, peritoneum, and lungs show development of tubercles varying 1-2 mm in diameter. The stained smear of the exudates shows the presence of AFB by microscope. M. tuberculosis is highly pathogenic for guinea pigs, while catalase-negative INH-resistant strains and most strains isolated from south India are low pathogenic for guinea pigs. M. tuberculosis is nonpathogenic for rabbits. M. bovis is pathogenic for both rabbits and guinea pigs. Inoculation in guinea pigs was earlier widely used for diagno- sis of tuberculosis. But guinea pig inoculation is now regarded as obsolete, because it is cumbersome, costly, and less sensitive than culture. Guinea pig inoculation is, however, superior to culture for isolation of M. bovis from clinical samples. Tuberculin skin test Tuberculin skin test (TST) is a widely used test for diagnosis of tuberculosis: It is used for evaluation of cases that have tuberculosis and for diagnosis of cases suspected to be infected with M. tuberculosis. It is used to diagnose active tuberculosis infection in infants and young children. It is also used to select population susceptible for BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccination. It is a valuable test to measure prevalence of tuberculosis infection in a community. TST can be performed by the following methods:Mantoux test: Mantoux test is the recommended method of skin test. The test is performed by intradermal injection of 0.1 mL or 5 tuberculin units (TU) PPD into the volar aspect of the forearm using a 27-G needle. It is essential that PPD is injected between the layers of the skin, but not subcutane-ously. Development of an induration of 10 mm or more at the site of injection after 48-72 hours is considered a positive test. Induration less than 5 mm is negative, while between 6 and 9 mm is considered equivocal. Erythema is not considered in reading of the test. If the test is negative with the PPD of 5 TU, then the test may be repeated using PPD of 10 or 100 TU. Purified protein derivative of 1 TU is used when the recipient is considered to be extremely hypersensitive to the antigen.Multiple puncture tests: These include the Heaf test and time test. Heaf test is performed by using the hit gun and by using disposable prongs carrying dried PPD. These tests may be satisfactory for screening and surveys but are not useful as diagnostic test because they lack sensitivity and specificity. A positive skin test indicates hypersensitivity of the indi- vidual to tubercle protein. This suggests infection with M. tuberculosis or immunization by BCG vaccination in recent or past with or without clinical disease. The TST becomes posi-tive 4-6 weeks after infection or immunization. The tubercle test positivity gradually disappears within 4-5 years in absence of reexposure to tubercle bacilli. In endemic areas, this positiv-ity is maintained due to repeated exposure to tubercle bacilli. A negative tubercle test indicates that the person has never come in contact with tubercle bacilli. The TST may show false-positive and false-negative False-positive reaction by en vironmental nontuberculous mycobacteria. 2. False-negative reactions may occur in patients with ( a) vacci- nation, (b) immunosuppressive therapy, (c) impaired CMI, (d) lymphoreticular malignancies, (e) immunodeficiency, (f) malnutrition, and (g) miliary tuberculosis. Improper administration, such as subcutaneous injection of PPD or injection of too little volume of antigen, contamination of PPD, or improper storage are the other factors that may give rise to false-negative reactions. Rapid and automated methods The conventional methods are very slow and time consuming and require 6-8 weeks for isolation of M. tuberculosis. Hence, recently more rapid and automated methods are being increas-ingly used for diagnosis of tuberculosis. These recent meth-ods include automated radiometric culture methods (e.g., BACTEC), SEPTICHEK, mycobacterial growth indicator tubes (MGITs), etc. Automated radiometric culture methods , such as BACTEC employ a liquid Middlebrook 7H12 medium radio-metric palmitic acid labeled with radioactive carbon-14 ( 14C). The medium also contains several antimicrobial agents to prevent the growth of other nonmycobacterial microbes. The result of the test is noted by demonstration of radiola-beled 14CO2 produced during the growth of mycobacteria. Growth of mycobacteria is usually detected within 9-16 days. SEPTICHEK is another rapid method for isolation of myco-bacteria. This is a nonradiometric method, which is based on a biphasic broth-based system that decreases the mean recovery time versus conventional methods.Molecular Diagnosis PCR and other nucleic acid amplification methods are useful for direct detection of M. tuberculosis in clinical specimens, such as CSF. The AMPICLOR M. tuberculosis direct test is an example of nucleic acid amplification tests available in devel-oped countries, such as the United States. The AMPICLOR test targets the insertion sequence IS6110 in the DNA of the tubercle bacilli. The sensitivity of the test varies from 40% to 60% and specificity is 95% in smear-positive cases of tuberculosis. The test is also rapid. Disadvantages of the test includes contamination of clinical specimen by products of previous amplification and presence of inhibitors that may give rise to false-negative or false-positive reactions. Chap-41.indd 355 5/14/2012 12:20:56 A new method employs MGITs, which show microbial growth and provide a quantitative index of M. tuberculosis growth. Round-bottom tubes with oxygen-sensitive sensors at the bottom are used in the test. Treatment Chemotherapy by antitubercular drugs has revolutionized the treatment of tuberculosis. Antituberculous therapy destroys the tubercle bacilli, thereby preventing further complications of early primary disease and progression of disease. Therapy with antituberculous drugs causes disappearance of caseous or granulomatous lesions. Antituberculous drugs are classified as pyrazinamide. first-line drugs with the exception of ethambutol are bactericidal. These drugs have less toxicity and show greater efficacy than second-line drugs. Both INH and rifampicin are effective against tubercle and capreomycin show poor intra-cellular penetration. Combination of four drugs (INH, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) is given for a period of 6-7 months for treat-ment of smear-positive cases of tuberculosis. These are given three times a week for first 2 months, followed by only two drugs (INH, rifampicin) three times a week. Emergence of natural drug resistance in M. tuberculosis is a major problem in chemotherapy of tuberculosis. This occurs by mutation with a frequency of appropriately 10 6 cell divisions. Multiple drug resistance: If the cases of tuberculosis are treated with a single antitubercular drug, the subpopulation of tubercle bacilli susceptible to that drug are killed, whereas populations not susceptible to the drug continue to multi-ply. Therefore, the use of multiple antitubercular agents in the treatment of tuberculosis is useful. The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a very seri-ous problem and is defined as resistance to rifampicin and INH with or without resistance to one or more other drugs. This is because rifampicin and INH form the mainstay of short-term chemotherapy, and M. tuberculosis strains resis-tant to both these drugs are unlikely to respond to treatment. Multiple drug resistance (MDR) is of two types\u2014primary and secondary. Primary MDR is defined as development of resistance to antitubercular treatment in an individual who has no history of antitubercular treatment. It usually occurs: In patients residing in areas with a high prevalence of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, In those exposed to drug-resistant contagious tuber-culosis, and In those with HIV infections and in the individuals using intravenous drugs.Secondary MDR is defined as emergence of antitubercular resistance during the course of infection and antitubercular treatment. It develops usually: In patients treated with inappropriate drug regimen and In those not taking antituberculous drugs regularly. The initial antitubercular regimen for patients with MDR includes four drugs. These contain at least four bactericidal drugs, such as INH, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either strepto-mycin or another aminoglycoside or dose of ethambutol. Second-line antitubercular drugs Second-line antitubercular drugs are used for the cases of tuber-culosis where first-line drugs become ineffective. These include a large number of old and new drugs, such as ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethionamide, kanamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, capreomycin, and others. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is a method being recently followed for treatment of cases of tuber-culosis. The DOT is extremely useful to prevent the emergence of drug resistance by ensuring patient compliance. Prevention and Control These include chemoprophylaxis, vaccination, and general health measures. Chemoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis or preventive chemotherapy is carried out by use of antitubercular drugs, such as INH. INH is usually used for treatment of: Persons with latent tuberculosis, Patients with HIV infection, Recent contact of patients with contagious tuberculosis in past 3 months, even if TST result is negative, Unvaccinated children, and Elderly person with radiological evidence of quiescent disease.These cases are treated by INH, given in a dose of 5 mg/kg daily for 6-12 months. Results of the study have shown that chemoprophylaxis by INH has considerably reduced the risk of acquiring the disease nearly by 90%. Vaccination Vaccination against tuberculosis is carried out by admin-istration of the vaccine. BCG is a live attenuated vaccine prepared from attenuated strain of M. bovis . This attenu- ated strain originally prepared by Calmette and Guerin (1921). They subcultured the bacterium every 3 weeks for 230 subcultures on potato soaked in sterile bile con-taining 5% glycerol during a period of 13 years. The BCG vaccine is available in liquid as well as freeze-dried (lyoph-ilized) form. The lyophilized form is commonly used, Chap-41.indd 356 5/14/2012 12:20:56 PMSection III Chapter 41MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS 357 which is reconstituted with sterile physiological saline to make a final concentration of 0.1 mL before admin-istration. The reconstituted vaccine has a shelf life of 3-6 hours. The vaccine is given by the administration of 0.1 mL of reconstituted vaccine intradermally. In a positive test, small nodule develops at the site of inoc- ulation 2-3 weeks after injection. It increases slowly in size and by about 5 weeks, it attains a diameter of 4-8 mm. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer, which heals by scarring. Following BCG vaccination, a tuberculin-negative indi- vidual is converted into a positive reactor. The immu-nity following BCG vaccination is similar and may last for 10-15 years. Although BCG vaccination has been used since 1921 and approximately 3 billion doses of vaccine have been given, the efficacy of the vaccine still continues to be controversial. Several field trials have been performed to assess the efficiency of the vaccine. The results have varied widely from 80% protection to a total absence of protection. However, two meta-analyses of the vaccine trials including the trials conducted in India have shown that BCG vaccine is effective against miliary and menin-geal tuberculosis. Vaccines BCG is used widely for prevention of tubercular meningitis and disseminated tuberculosis, two serious and life- threatening diseases in children. BCG vaccine does not prevent infection with M. tuberculosis. Controversy exists about the efficacy of BCG vaccine against pulmonary tuberculosis. BCG vaccine is contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients with (a) HIV infection, (b) primary or secondary immunodeficiency, and (c) in patients receiving steroids. The complications of BCG vaccine include formation of subcutaneous abscess and development of lymphadenopa-thy at the site of inoculation. Disseminated tuberculosis and osteitis of epiphysis of the long bones are the rare com-plications. The complications may require treatment with antitubercular drugs except pyrazinamide. The vaccine is now being used in more than 100 countries and is given to infants usually at birth. The WHO recommends the use of vaccine in children who have asymptomatic HIV infection in the areas where the risk of tuberculosis is high. General health measures General health measures include adequate nutrition, good housing, and health education. A 30-year-old male laborer working in a stone-crushing unit attended Medicine OPD with history of fever and cough with purulent sputum for the past 3 months, associated with loss of weight, and loss of appetite, and cough with expectoration. Gram stain of sputum sample showed normal commensal flora. WBC count and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were raised. Chest X-ray showed presence of cavity in left epical lobe of the lung.

These are also known as mycobacteria other than tubercle bacilli (MOTT). These bacteria, which normally occur as saprophytes of soil and water, may occasionally cause opportunistic infection in humans, which resemble tuberculosis. These bacteria, therefore, were also earlier known as atypical, environmental, or opportunis-tic mycobacteria. The bacteria causing opportunistic infections are summarized in Table 42-1. NTM or atypical mycobacteria show the following features: 1. Some of them are rapid growers. They produce colonies within 1-2 weeks of incubation in Lo wenstein-Jensen (LJ ) medium. 2. They can grow at 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and even at 44\u00b0C. 3. Some of them may produce bright yellow or orange pigments during their gro wth on the LJ medium. 4. They are acid fast as well as alcohol fast. They may differ from or may resemble the tuber cle bacilli. 5. They are arylsulfatase test positive, but are niacin and neutral red reactions negativ e.Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Bacteria (occasional) Mycobacterium xenopi Chronic pulmonary disease Mycobacterium avium 42-1Human infections caused by atypical Mycobacterium species 6. They are usually resistant to antitubercular drugs, such as streptom ycin, isoniazid (INH), and p-aminosalicylic acid. 7. They are nonpathogenic for guinea pigs, but pathogenic for mouse. MOTT are classif ied as rapid growers and fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonae, and Myco- bacterium abscessus are the examples of more rapidly growing Mycobacterium species, which require incubation for 3 days or more for development of the colonies. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex and Mycobacte- rium kansasii are species and require 3-8 weeks of incubation for their growth. Most of the human infections are caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. M. avium complex, M. abscessus, chelonae, and M. fortuitum are the examples of MOTT associated with frequent human infections. Classification Saprophytic bacteria or MOTT were classified by Runyon into four groups on the basis of their rate of growth and their ability to produce pigments in the presence or absence of light: Runyon's group I: Pigment-producing mycobacteria are classified into Runyon's group I (photochromogenic myco-bacteria), which produce pigment on exposure to light. Runyon's group II : Runyon's group II (scotochromogenic mycobacteria), which produce pigments in the dark and in the light. Runyon's group III: Slow-growing nonpigmented mycobac-teria are classified as Runyon's group III. Runyon's group IV : More rapidly growing mycobacteria are classified as Runyon's group IV (rapid growers). This system of classification is known as Runyon's classification. Photochromogens These strains do not produce any pigments in the colonies that are incubated in dark, but form pigments when the young culture is exposed to light for 1 hour in the presence of air and is reincubated for 24-48 hours. These bacteria produce yellow-orange pigments during such conditions. These mycobacte-ria are slow-growing ones, but grow faster (after 7 days) than the tubercle bacilli. The most common species are causes infection localized to lymphatic tissues and is responsible for causing scrofula or cervical adenitis in children. Mor phologically, on staining, the bacil- lus shows short or long filaments. It is sensitive to cycloser-ine, but resistant to INH. M. gordonae rarely causes pulmonary disease. It is often found as a contaminant in tap water, hence called tap water scotochromogen. This is also found as a contaminant in clinical specimens. M. gordonae does not hydrolyze urea, nicotinamide, and pyrazinamide; in this respect, it differs from M. scrofulaceum. M. szulgai occasionally may cause pulmonary disease and bursitis. It is a scotochromogen when grown at 37\u00b0C and photochromogen when grown at 27\u00b0C. Nonphotochromogens Nonphotochromogens are the mycobacteria that do not produce pigment in dark or on exposure to light. These include M. avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium xenopi , MAC consists of M. avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare. They are found commonly in the environment such as in soil and in water (brackish, ocean, and drinking water). MAC organisms are strongly acid-fast mycobacteria with a cell wall rich in lipids. They are weakly positive aerobic bacteria. This complex possesses 28 agglutination types. Types 1, 2, and 3 are considered as M. avium and other types as M. intracellulare. Ability to grow inside the cells is the main virulence determinant of the bacteria. In infected humans, development of the disease depends primarily on response of host to infection. MAC produces a disease similar to pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with compromised pulmonary function, such as patients with chronic bronchitis or obstructive pulmonary disease, i.e., previous damage to lungs as a result of infection or other disease. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, MAC produces a typically disseminated disease affecting virtually every organ in infected humans. Intensity of infections caused by MAC in these patients is very high. In some patients, tissues are overloaded with mycobacteria, and blood contains nearly 100-1000 mycobacteria/mL of blood. The disseminated infection is commonly seen in persons at the terminal stage of the immunological disorder, with their CD4 count falling below 10 cells/cu mm. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) acquire MAC infection following inhalation of infectious aerosols. The infection is also acquired by ingestion of the water or food contaminated with mycobacteria. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Diagnosis of infection is made by microscopy of clini- cal specimens and culture on LJ with Mycobacterium marinum , and Mycobacterium simiae . Some of these mycobacteria produce disease similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. Most of these mycobacteria have been isolated from water and soil in the environment. M. kansasii reduces nitrates to nitrites (Color Photo 43) and shows a positive Tween 80 hydrolysis (Color Photo 44) test within 3-6 hours, while other mycobacteria species produce positive test within 3-10 days. M. kansasii causes a disease identical to pulmonary tuberculosis, which is associated with formation of cavity and scarring, usually in the upper lobe of the lungs. This species is the second most common NTM, next to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), as causative agent of lung diseases. These strains have been frequently isolated from tap water, and infected tap water is believed to be the major source of infection. M. kansasii grows rapidly on LJ medium, producing visible colonies within 2 weeks. It is sensitive to rifampicin and other antitubercular drugs. M. marinum closely resembles M. kansasii but is differenti- ated from it by its (a) poor growth at 37\u00b0C, (b) failure to reduce nitrate to nitrite, and (c) failure to produce the enzyme catalase. M. marinum\u2014originally isolated from fish\u2014is the causative agent of swimming pool or fish tank granuloma. This condi-tion is associated with development of superficial granuloma-tous lesions in the skin. M. simiae associated with pulmonary disease in humans was originally isolated from monkeys. This species grows well at 37\u00b0C and is niacin positive, like M. tuberculosis. Scotochromogens These mycobacteria are characterized by their ability to pro-duce yellow, orange, or red pigmented colonies on the LJ medium even when incubated in dark (Fig. 42-1, Color Photo 45). These species are widely distributed in the environ-ment. Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, LJ media for growth of atypical Mycobacterium species: one medium showing yellow colonies of atypical mycobacteria, while the other medium showing no with ethambutol and rifabutin for a long period is effective for the treatment of infection. Chemoprophylaxis with clarithromycin or azithro-mycin in AIDS patients with low CD4 cell count has reduced the incidence of MAC drastically in these patients.M. xenopi was originally isolated from a cutaneous lesion of a South African toad (Xenopus laevis). The organism is a thermophilic mycobacterium, which may occasionally cause chronic pulmonary lesions in humans. Most of these infec-tions have been documented from London. The bacteria have been isolated from mostly hot water taps and also from main water supplies in hospitals.M. ulcerans is a skin pathogen, which was originally iso- lated from human ulcerative skin lesions in Australia (1958). Subsequently, the species causing similar cutaneous lesions have been documented from Uganda (Buruli ulcer), Nigeria, Congo, Malaysia, New Guinea, and Mexico. M. ulcerans grows slowly on LJ medium in 4-8 weeks when incubated at 31-34\u00b0C. However, this species fails to grow when incubated at 37\u00b0C in primary culture. Key Points M. ulcerans is the only known mycobacterial species to pro-duce exotoxins. This toxin is a phospholipoprotein-lipo-polysaccharide complex with a high molecular weight. The toxin produces inflammation and necrosis when inoculated intradermally into the skin of guinea pigs and lesions similar to those seen in humans are formed. It is therefore believed that the toxin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcer\u2014the main pathology of the disease seen in humans. Ulcers of the skin are typically seen on the legs or on the arms. After an incubation period of few weeks, initially the infection begins by minor injuries on the skin through which mycobac-teria gain access. The infection begins with the appearance of an indurated nodule at the site of inoculation, which breaks down forming an indolent ulcer. Diagnosis of the condition is made by microscopy of the smears, collected from the edge of the ulcer. Large number of acid-fast and alcohol-fast bacilli are seen the stained smear by microscopy. Finally, the ulcer heals with formation of scars. Rapid Growers Group IV, or rapid growers, is a heterogenous group of myco-bacteria that produce visible growth on LJ medium rapidly within 1 week of incubation at 37\u00b0C or 25\u00b0C. This group may also include photochromogens, scotochromogens, or nonpho-tochromogens species. Some of the rapid Mycobacterium phlei) and are five species which are recog-nized as important opportunistic pathogens of humans. These Mycobacterium species are M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. abscessus, M. smegmatis, and M. these rapid growers: stain irregularly with acid-fast stains; show relatively low virulence; and are relatively more susceptible to treatment with conven-tional antibacterial antibiotics than to antimycobacterial agents. These bacteria are usually associated with diseases of deep sub-cutaneous tissues following trauma or iatrogenic infections. These species have been isolated from contaminated wound dressing, infections associated with intravenous catheter, or infections associated with prosthetic devices, such as heart-lung machine. Such infections are now being increasingly recognized from hospitalized patients due to increase in the use of such medical devices. M. fortuitum and M. chelonae are nonchromogens; they do not produce any pigments. Both the species cause chronic abscesses in humans following infections of vaccines and other preparations contaminated by these mycobacteria. The infec-tion also occurs following some injury. These bacilli are usually found in the soil. M. fortuitum causes pulmonary disease similar to pulmonary tuberculosis. Both M. chelonae and M. fortuitum grow well at 35\u00b0C and form white- to cream-colored colonies and reveal coccoid nonpathogenic. It produces buff-colored colonies, which on further incubation become yellow to orange. M. phlei differs from M. smegmatis by its ability to grow at 52\u00b0C and survive heating at 60\u00b0C for 4 hours. M. smegmatis is normally found in smegma, a whitish secre- tion around the orifice of urethra. These bacilli are slender, curved, and rigid rods. These bacilli are both acid and alcohol fast, but some bacilli may only be acid fast but not alcohol fast. M. smegmatis is a rare human pathogen associated with occa-sional cases of lung, skin, and bone infections. Differential properties of important atypical Mycobacterium species are summarized in Table 42-2. A young man was admitted in the Medicine ward with history of severe cough and fever for 15 days. Detailed history revealed that he was a lorry driver and was exposed to multiple sexual partners. His serum was positive for HIV antibodies. ZN-stained smear from early morning sputum sample was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Chest X-ray revealed diffuse haziness. Sputum culture on LJ medium showed growth within 3 days. The colonies were nonpigmented in presence or absence of light. What is the most probable diagnosis? What are the predisposing factors in causation of diseases due to atypical mycobacteria? How will you diagnose this condition in the laboratory? What are the antibiotics used for treatment of the condition?CASE STUDY agent of leprosy, a chronic granulomatous disease primarily affecting the skin and periph-eral nervous system. M. leprae was the first bacterial pathogen to be associated with a specific human disease and the only mycobacterium known to cause infection of the nervous tissue. The Koch's postulates have never been fulfilled for M. leprae, because so far it has not been cultivated in vitro. Mycobacterium leprae M. leprae was discovered in 1873 by Arinuer Hansen in Italy. Leprosy was not initially thought to be an infectious disease, despite discovery of M. leprae. Tremendous advancement has been made on the knowledge of pathogenesis, cause, treatment, and prevention of leprosy during the last 25 years. Nevertheless, the lesions were responsible for the social stigma attached to the disease. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology M. leprae shows the following morphological features: M. leprae is less acid fast than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Hence 5% sulphuric acid, instead of 20%, is used for deco-lourization after staining with carbol fuchsin. It is Gram positive and stains more readily than M. tuberculosis. It is a straight or slightly curved rod with parallel sides and rounded ends. It measures 1-8 /H9262 m in length and 0.2-0.5 /H9262 m in diameter, showing considerable morphological variations. The bacteria exhibit cubical, lateral, or even branching forms. M. leprae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that multi-plies preferentially in tissues at cooler temperature. M. leprae are nonmotile and nonsporing. The bacilli are seen singly and in groups intracellularly as well as extracellularly lying free outside the cell. The bacilli inside the cell are usually present in parallel bundles of 50 or more. Acid-fast bacteria are bound together by a lipid-like substance known as glia. These masses of bacteria are known as globi. The parallel rows of bacilli in the globi present a \"cigar bundle\" appearance. These are present inside the large undifferentiated histiocytes, which have a foamy appearance. These are known as Virchow's lepra cells or foamy cells. Culture So far, M. leprae has not been cultivated in vitro either in bacte-riological media or in tissue culture. The ICRC (Indian Cancer Research Center) bacillus is an example of an acid-fast bacillus and was first isolated from a leprosy patient employing human fetal spinal ganglion cell culture. This bacillus was reported in 1962 from the Indian Cancer Research Center, Mumbai, and has been adapted for growth on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium. However, its relation to M. leprae is uncertain, and many studies have suggested that ICRC bacillus is not M. leprae but may be a variant of Mycobacterium, belonging to Mycobacterium avium intra-cellulare group.Experimental animal models: Many attempts have been made to develop a suitable experimental animal model for M. leprae. These include the following:Footpads of mice: Shepard, in 1960, was the first to culture lepra bacilli in the footpads of mice kept at a low temperature of 20\u00b0C. The mouse footpad inoculation method is now being used as a standard procedure for experimental works by using M. leprae. Intradermal inoculation of lepra bacilli into the foot-pads of mice results in development of granuloma at the site of inoculation in 1-6 months. The mouse footpad model has been used to test (a) the maximum required concentration of antileprosy drugs and (b) sensitivity of the bacilli to new ant-ileprosy drugs.Thymectomized mouse: A thymectomized mouse is an experi-mental animal model, in which cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is suppressed by thymectomy on administration of antilymphocytic serum. In such mice, inoculation of M. leprae produces a generalized infection similar to that of leproma-tous leprosy. Thymectomized irradiated mice model has also been used to detect small numbers of live lepra bacilli and is also used to detect persistent disease following treatment by chemotherapy.Nine-banded armadillo: The armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is another animal highly susceptible to infection with M. leprae. In armadillos, M. leprae cause a generalized infection with exten- sive multiplication of the bacteria. M. leprae in these animals produces a lesion typical of lepromatous leprosy and survives for about 400 days in infected armadillos. This animal is now being used as the most important source of lepra bacilli for genetic studies including development of vaccine. and infections by Mycobacterium organisms resembling M. leprae have also been observed in some wild armadillos held in captiv-ity in Texas and Mexico.Other animals: Other animals that have been used for experi-mental infection by M. leprae include slender loris, Indian pangolin, and Korean chipmunks. M. leprae shows the longest generation time among all bacteria requiring 12-13 days to double in experimental infected mice as compared to about 14 hours in case of M. tuberculosis and about 20 minutes in case of coliform bacilli. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: M. leprae remains viable in warm humid environment for 9-16 days and in moist soil for 46 days. They also remain viable on exposure to ultraviolet light for 30 minutes and to direct sunlight for 2 hours. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure The genomic sequence of M. leprae has been mapped and completed recently. The genes responsible for its major protein have been cloned and sequenced. One important finding is that M. leprae retains genes for formation of mycobacterial cell wall. The cell wall components of M. leprae stimulate the production of IgM antibodies and cell-mediated immune response, and also moderate the bactericidal activity of macrophages. The cell wall of M. leprae like that of other mycobacteria consists of four layers: Peptidoglycan is the innermost layer, which gives the bacte-ria rigidity and shape. Lipoarabinomannose-B (LAM-B) is a layer next to peptido-glycan layer. A dense palisade of characteristic long-chain fatty acid known as mycolic acid is the third layer attached to LAM-B membrane. A layer composed of mycosides is the outermost fourth layer of the cell wall. Phenolic glycolipid (PGL)-1 is the major component of the outermost layer of the cell wall. Antigenic structure M. leprae contains a wide variety of mycobacterial anti-gens. LAM-B is a major antigen of M. leprae. LAM-B is highly immunogenic and induces a high level of serum antibodies. It is distinct from lipoarabinomannose of M. tuberculosis. PGL-1 is the major antigen component of the outermost layer of the cell wall, which is composed of mycosides. The anti-gen suppresses CMI and protects M. leprae from the action of host cell enzymes. The polysaccharides component of PGL-1 antigen induces development of higher antibodies in patients with leprosy.Protein antigens: M. leprae consists of a large number of protein antigens. The major protein antigens include (a) 65-kDa heat shock proteins, ( b) 28-kDa protein, and (c ) 18-kDa protein. 1. The 65-kDa heat shock protein induces a humoral anti-body response in the initial phase of M. leprae infection. This antibody response continues to persist during various stages of disease including reactional stage. 2. The 28-kDa antigen protein is the superoxide dismutase of M. leprae . The protein stimulates a higher antibody response in the lepromatous leprosy than in the tuberculoid leprosy. The antigen also produces even higher antibody response in type 1 reaction. 3. The 18-kDa protein is one of the most important anti-gens, which produces both humoral and cell-mediated responses in a person. All types of leprosy excep t tubercu- loid leprosy show a high level of antibodies in the serum against 18-kDa antigen. Pathogenesis and Immunity Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease exclusively of humans. Superficial peripheral nerves, skin, mucous mem-branes of the upper respiratory tract, anterior chamber of the eye, and testis are most commonly affected. Virulence factors M. leprae is an obligate intracellular acid-fast bacillus with an affinity for macrophages and Schwann cells. The virulence of M. leprae is mainly due to: Its capabilities for intracellular multiplication and growth and Host's immune system that influences the clinical form of the disease (Table 43-1). Phenolic glycolipid-1: PGL-1 is a prominent surface lipid found on the outermost layer of the cell wall. This lipid is specific to M. leprae and is the best-studied virulence factor of M. leprae (Table 43-1). PGL-1 binds to C3 component of the Virulence factors Biological functions Phenolic glycolipid-1 (PGL-1) Protects the lepra bacillus from oxidative by removing hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions The intracellular location of the bacteria Makes them resistant to killing by phagocytesTABLE 43-1 Virulence factors of phagocytosis mediated by CR1, CR3, and CR4 receptors found on the cell surfaces. PGL-1 protects the lepra bacillus, once inside the phagocytic cells, from oxidative killing by macrophages by removing hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. Pathogenesis of leprosy The pathogenesis of the disease leading to tissue dam-age caused by M. leprae infection depends on the following factors: CMI of the host, Multiplication and extent of spread of lepra bacilli, Development of immunological complications such as lepra reaction leading to tissue damage, and Development of nerve damage and its sequelae. Leprosy is primarily transmitted by infected nasal secretions. Infections by a very large number of lepra bacilli lead to leproma-tous leprosy. A strong cell-mediated response, however, results in mild form of the disease with low bacterial load and involve-ment of only few nerves. Therefore, CMI is mainly found in mild form of disease and decreases with the severity of the disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also play important role in the pathogenesis of leprosy. TLRs, such as TLR-1 and TLR-2, are found on the surface of Schwann cells, especially in patients with tuberculoid leprosy. M. leprae activates this receptor on Schwann cells, which is suggested to be responsible for the activation of apoptosis genes and which enhances the onset of nerve damage seen in the mild disease. A sudden increase in T-cell immunity is also responsible for type 1 reversal reactions. Activation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the deposition of immune complexes in tissues with neutrophilic invasion results in type 2 reaction. Skin and peripheral nerves are commonly involved in lep- rosy. Although bacilli are also found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, no clinical signs of dysfunction of these visceral organs are noted. The destructive lesions in leprosy, even in most advanced cases, are limited to the peripheral nerves, skin, and upper respiratory passages above the larynx, anterior chamber of the eye, testis, hands, and feet. Higher body temperature or sys-temic signs of toxicity are absent, although the lepra bacilli are found in the peripheral blood during the disease. Classification of leprosy Ridley and Jopling (1966) introduced a system of classifica-tion of leprosy on the basis of clinical, histopathological, and immunological findings. This classification is used to differen-tiate types of leprosy and helps in determining the prognosis following treatment with antileprosy therapy. They classified leprosy into five groups: (a) tuberculoid (TT), (b) borderline tuberculoid (BT), (c) borderline (BB), (d) borderline leproma-tous (BL), and (e) lepromatous (LL). Lepromatous leprosy and tuberculoid leprosy are the two extreme or polar forms of the disease.Key Points Lepromatous leprosy: This form of leprosy is seen in persons with low CMI. The lepra bacilli are seen in large numbers inside the cells or outside the cells. This is known as multibacillary disease. The patients are highly infectious to others. Since CMI is absent, lepromin test is negative. Tuberculin sensitivity may be negative or suppressed in untreated lepromatous leprosy, but it becomes positive fol-lowing the treatment. In contrast, the humoral immunity is stronger in leproma-tous leprosy and is characterized by strong humoral anti-body responses. High levels of antibodies are found in the serum. Autoantibodies are also frequently found. The skin lesions are usually bilaterally symmetrical and nonanesthetic. Tuberculoid leprosy: This is other end of the spectrum which is seen in patients with stronger CMI. Bacilli are scanty or few in the lesions, hence are of minimal infectivity to others. Lepromin test is positive. Tuberculin sensitivity is positive. The humoral antibody response is weak, hence antibodies in the serum is rare. Skin lesions are few and the prognosis is good. The Indian classification of leprosy\u2014borderline tuberculoid, borderline, and borderline lepromatous\u2014usually represents type of leprosy, which shows characteristics of both tubercu-loid and lepromatous leprosy. These lesions may progress to either lepromatous or tuberculoid type of lesions depending on the strength of immunity. The lesions heal spontaneously in about 75% of affected persons. Purely neuritic leprosy is an additional form of leprosy described recently. This form is characterized by asymptomatic peripheral neuropathies without any skin lesions. These cases are negative for the bacteria. Host immunity M. leprae infection induces development of antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunities in the infected host. The CMI is only protective against the disease. The progression of the disease is primarily dependent on the CMI. The CMI is intact in the tubercular leprosy, whereas it is lacking or minimal in lepromatous leprosy (Fig. 43-1). The infected persons with tuberculoid leprosy show a strong delayed hypersensitivity reaction to lepromin. The macrophages phagocytose the bacilli and destroy them. Immunogenetics of leprosy Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II serological typing has shown an association of tuberculoid leprosy with DR2 in Indian population. DRB1-1501 and -1502 are the predominant subtypes of DR2 associated with lepromatous leprosy. These two subtypes are implicated in presentation of pathogenic pep-tides of mycobacteria. DQ1 presentation has been be associated with an immunosuppression gene for M. leprae, since lepromatous leprosy and borderline leprosy have shown an increased frequency of DQ1. In tuberculoid leprosy, M. leprae peptides probably bind selectively to HLA allele forms (HLA-DR2) as well as other positively associated DR antigens and stimulate T-cell clones that result in a harmful immune response. Complete anergy to native heat shock proteins is characteristically seen in leproma-tous leprosy. Clinical Syndromes Leprosy M. leprae causes leprosy, a chronic granulomatous disease. The clinical manifestations of leprosy depend on immune status of the host and spread of the bacilli. It is classified into five groups as: (a) tuberculoid leprosy, ( b) borderline tuberculoid leprosy, (c) mid-borderline leprosy, (d) borderline lepromatous leprosy, and (e) lepromatous leprosy. The incubation period varies from 6 months to 40 years or longer. The mean incubation period for tuberculoid leprosy is 4 years and for lepromatous leprosy is 10 years.Tuberculoid leprosy: Skin lesions are few. These are usu-ally circular, or serpiginous, sharply demarcated and often hypopigmented. These lesions may have raised and erythem-atous border with a dry scaly appearance in the center with complete anesthesia. The skin lesions are commonly found on the face, limbs, buttocks, or elsewhere but are not found in the axilla, perineum, or scalp. Neural involvement is common in tuberculoid leprosy. The ulnar, peroneal, and greater auricular nerves are involved, lead-ing to tender, thickened nerves with subsequent loss of func-tion. Damage of the nerve can result in wrist drop or foot drop.Borderline tuberculoid leprosy: Lesions in this form of leprosy are similar to those seen in the tuberculoid leprosy, but are smaller and more numerous. Skin lesions are few, asymmet-ric, and with nearly complete anesthesia. Peripheral nerves are thickened and involved asymmetrically. This form of leprosy may remain at this stage or can regress to the tuberculoid form; or it can progress to lepromatous form.Mid-borderline leprosy: Skin lesions in this type of leprosy consist of numerous unequally shaped plaques that are less well defined than in the tuberculoid types. These skin lesions are distributed asymmetrically (Fig. 43-2, Color Photo 46). Anesthesia is moderate, and the disease can remain in this stage, can improve, or worsen.Borderline lepromatous leprosy: Skin lesions are moderate to numerous. They are slightly asymmetrical with slight or no anesthesia. Peripheral nerves are enlarged moderately and sym-metrical. Like the other forms of borderline leprosy, the disease may remain in this stage, improve, or worsen.Lepromatous leprosy: The skin lesions include macules, nodules, plaques, or papules. The skin lesions are extensive and are bilaterally symmetrical. They are most severe at the cooler parts of the body. This form of disease is associated with dis-figurative lesions. The skin of the face and forehead becomes thickened and corrugated, giving rise to typical leonine face. The lateral part of the eyebrows may be lost. Other disfigur-ing lesions include pendulous ear lobes, hoarseness of voice, involvement of cornea (Color Photo 47), perforation of the nasal septum, and of testis leading to sterility and gynecomastia are other complications. Diffuse hyperanesthesia involving peripheral parts of extremi-ties also occur due to involvement of the neural tissue. Differential features of various forms of leprosy are summa- rized in Table 43-2.Tuberculoid Leprosy Large macular lesions in cooler regions of the skin Not very infectious CMI intact Lepromatous Leprosy Extensive erythematous lesions with destruction of skin Very low CMI Highly infectiousAs disease progresses FIG. 43-1. Comparison of tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy. FIG. 43-2. seen over Chapter 43366 BACTERIOLOGY Lepra reactions The course of leprosy may be interspersed with reactional stage, which occurs in one-third of the patients. These reactions are of allergic nature and are acute inflammation of the disease and are known as lepra reactions. These reactions are consid-ered a medical emergency, requiring immediate treatment and management. Such leprous reactions include: (a) lepra type I (reversal) reaction, (b) lepra type II reaction or erythema nodo-sum leprosum (ENL), and (c) lucio phenomenon.Lepra type I reaction: Lepra type I reaction is a type IV cell-mediated allergic hypersensitivity. This reaction is seen mostly in patients with borderline leprosy, occurring spontaneously or more often during chemotherapy. These reversal reactions usually suggest a shift toward tuberculoid form after start of chemotherapy. This type I response is precipitated by puberty, pregnancy, and childbirth. This reaction usually occurs during the first 2 months of therapy to up to 12 months. These reac-tions are characterized by development of skin erythema with edema and tenderness of peripheral nerves.Lepra type II reaction: Lepra type II reactions are type III humoral hypersensitivity reactions with systemic inflam-matory response due to deposition of immune complexes. This condition occurs in 20% of patients with lepromatous leprosy and in 10% of patients with borderline leprosy. This reaction occurs after a few years of therapy and relapse inter-mittently over several years. Appearance of crops of painful erythematous nodules on the skin and subcutaneous tissue is the characteristic manifestation. Fever, malaise, arthralgia, neuralgia, iridocyclitis, arthritis, and proteinuria are other symptoms.Lucio phenomenon: Lucio phenomenon is an unusual form of type II reaction. The condition manifests as cutaneous hemorrhagic infarct in patients with diffuse lepromatous lep-rosy. This condition is commonly documented in Mexico and Central America. Epidemiology Leprosy is a disease prevalent worldwide. Geographical distribution The worldwide prevalence of leprosy is /H11021 1 case/10,000 popula- tion. Most cases of leprosy are found in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Fifteen endemic countries in these areas have a prev-alence of /H110221 case/10,000 populations. Leprosy is most endemic in Brazil, Angola, Central African Republic, Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Nepal, and India. Approximately 74% of these cases are found in these nine countries. Lepromatous leprosy is more prevalent in Africa, while tuberculosis is more frequent in Asia. In India, leprosy is present in all states and territories. Orissa and Bihar have a higher prevalence of more than 5 cases/1000 population, whereas Haryana has the least (0.1/1000 population). Overall, the prevalence of the disease has decreased since the introduction of short multidrug therapy in 1982. Habitat In infected host, M. leprae is found in large number in infected nasal secretions of patients with lepromatous leprosy. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Leprosy is an exclusively human disease. Humans are the prime reservoir of M. leprae. Nine-banded armadillo, chimpanzee, and mangabey monkeys are the three animal species known to be important animal reservoirs of leprosy. Leprosy is not a highly infectious disease. Lepromatous forms of the disease, but not the tuberculoid form, is infectious. Nasal secretions from patients with lepromatous leprosy are important source of infection. Very large numbers of lepra bacilli are shed in the nasal secretions. As high as 8 /H11003 10 8 bacilli can be discharged during a single act of nose blow of the patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy. Inhalation of infectious aerosol and skin contact with respi- ratory secretions or wound exudates are the most important routes of infection in leprosy. The following observations sup-port transmission of infection through the respiratory route: Large numbers of morphologically intact lepra bacilli are demonstrated in the nasal discharges. The organisms have not been detected on the surface of the skin. Tuberculoid leprosyBorderline tuberculoid leprosyBorderline 43-2 Differential 12:19:40 Lepra bacilli survive for several hours or days outside the human host. Experimental transmission of leprosy has been achieved by aerosols containing M. leprae and by topical application in immunosuppressed mice. Leprosy is usually not spread by means of direct contact through intact skin, though close contacts are more susceptible. Lepromatous leprosy is more common in men than women, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Tuberculoid leprosy predom-inates in children. The disease is rare in infants. Laboratory Diagnosis The diagnosis of leprosy is essentially clinical. Laboratory diagnosis of leprosy is essentially based on demonstration of acid-fast M. leprae in the skin smears by microscopy. They are helpful in making definitive diagnosis of leprosy. This is supplemented by skin test and newer molecular diagnostic techniques. Specimens In lepromatous leprosy, lepra bacilli are always found in large numbers in the skin and in the nose. Therefore, smears col-lected from the nasal mucosa, skin lesions, and ear lobules are the specimens of choice for microscopy. Occasionally, the spec-imens may be collected from lymph nodes and affected nerves in lepromatous leprosy. In tuberculoid leprosy, the bacilli are not found in these specimens.Skin smears: The skin smears are collected from the leprous lesions, such as nodules, thick papules, and areas of infiltration. In cases of patches, the samples are obtained from the edge of the lesion rather than from the center. In patients with only diffuse infiltrations, skin smears are collected from five to six different sites including the skin over the ear lobes, buttocks, forehead, cheeks, and chin.Slit and scrap method: The skin smears from these sites are collected by slit and scrap method. In this method, the skin is pinched up and raised between the thumb and index finger of the left hand, which squeezes out blood from that part, thereby minimizing bleeding when a cut is made. Then with the help of a scalpel, a cut about 5 mm is made on the pinched skin, deep enough to get into the infiltrated layers. After wiping of blood or lymph that may have exudated, the blade of the scalpel is turned at right angle to the cut and the sides and bottom of the cut are scraped with point of the blade several times in the same direction, so that the tissue fluid and pulp but not blood are collected on one side of the blade. Obtained fluid and tis-sues are thickly spread on a slide and stained by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) technique.Nasal smears: Smears from the nasal patches are collected by scraping material from the mucous membrane of the internal nasal septum, particularly from inferior turbinate folds of the nasal septum. This mucous membrane is then spread on a slide and a uniform smear is made, which is stained by ZN method as mentioned earlier. Microscopy The slit-skin smears, nasal smears, or smears from other speci-men on the slide are stained by using the ZN method and partially decolorized with 5% instead of 20% acid. In a positive, stained smear, red-colored acid-fast bacilli are seen on examination by oil immersion lens (Fig. 43-3, Color Photo 48). The smears are graded based on the numbers of bacilli as men-tioned in Table 43-3. Bacillary index and morphological index are two indices, which are based on demonstration of M. leprae in smears from skin or nasal discharges. These two indices are useful for: Demonstrating viability of organisms, Assessing amount of infection, and Assessing the progress of patients after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Bacillary index: The bacillary index or BI is an expression of the extent of bacterial load. It is calculated by counting six to eight stained smears under the 100/H11003 oil immersion lens. This index is obtained by totaling the number of plusses (plus scored in all the smears and divided by the number of the smears). For example, if six smears showed a total of 12/H11001, the bacillary index will be 2. For this index, a minimum of four skin lesions, a nasal swab, and both ear lobes are examined. The bacillary index is usually affected by the thickness of the film, depth of the skin incision, and thoroughness of the scrap (Table 43-3).Morphological index: The uniformity of the bacilli is used as a criterion to differentiate live bacilli from dead bacilli in stained smears. It is calculated by counting solid stained bacilli out of the total number of bacilli counted. The lepra bacilli that stain uniformly with carbol fuchsin as solid acid-fast rods are believed to be viable, and the bacilli that stain irregu-larly are considered dead and degenerated. The percentage of uniformly stained bacilli in the tissues is known as morpho-logical index (MI). This index is a useful method for assessing the response of patients of leprosy with antileprosy agents, and is more use-ful than the bacteriological index (BI). A decrease in the MI indicates better response of the patients to chemotherapy, whereas a decrease in MI followed by an increased MI indicates FIG. 43-3. Slit-skin smear poor response to chemotherapeutic agents due to development of drug resistance in the bacteria. The other methods that are also useful in detecting viable lepra bacilli include (a) fluorescent diacetate-ethidium and (c) macrophage-based assays. Key Points Nasal smears are positive in lepromatous leprosy and borderline leprosy but are negative in tuberculoid leprosy, mid-borderline leprosy, and borderline tuberculoid leprosy. Examination of nasal smears is useful to know whether a leprosy patient is infectious or not. The lepra bacilli usually disappear more rapidly from the nose than from the skin lesions following chemotherapy. Skin biopsy is useful for the diagnosis and proper classification of lep-rosy. The samples are usually obtained from the edge of the lesion; a biopsy smear or scalpel may be used for the purpose.Nerve biopsy: Nerve biopsy is a very useful method in the diagnosis of leprosy: This is useful to differentiate lepromatous cause of thickened nerves from other nonlepromatous causes of thickened nerves in people residing in endemic areas for the disease. This is useful to rule out other diseases, such as polyradiculoneu-ropathy, hereditary neuropathies, or polyarteritis nodosa. This is the only method to confirm diagnosis in cases of leprosy with pure neuropathic forms. The nerve biopsy occasionally shows abnormalities, even in con-tacts of patients with leprosy.Biopsy Lepromin test The lepromin test is used to study host immunity to M. leprae. The test was first described by Mitsuda in 1919. The test is an intradermal skin test performed by using lepromin antigen, which is a suspension of killed M. leprae obtained from infected human or armadillo tissue.Antigen: Originally, crude antigen obtained from human lepromatous tissue rich in M. leprae was used as antigen. This antigen was first prepared by Mitsuda in 1919 by using anti-gens extracted from skin lesions of lepromatous patients. This antigen known as standard Mitsuda lepromin con-tains 4.0 /H11003 10 7 M. leprae per mL, which have a shelf life of 2 years when stored at 4\u00b0C. Recently, the standard lepro-min antigen is being prepared from armadillo derived lepra bacilli antigen: Bacillary lepromin is another type of antigen, which contains more of bacillary components and less of tissue components. Dharmender's antigen is an exam-ple of such antigen. This antigen was first prepared by Indian scientist Dharmender by separating the bacilli from finely ground lepromatous tissue and treating with chloroform. The suspension is then evaporated to make it dry and then washed with ether to remove the lipids. The antigen, finally, is reconstituted in phenol saline for use. However, more recently, soluble antigens from M. leprae have also been used as antigens in the skin test.Test: Lepromin skin test is performed by intradermal injection of lepromin antigen into the forearm. Two types of reactions are observed after the test. First, early or Fernandez reaction and second, late or Mitsuda reaction.Early or Fernandez reaction is observed after 48 hours of injection. Positive reaction is characterized by the appearance of a localized area of inflammation with congestion and edema measuring 10 mm and more in diameter during 24-48 hours of injection. These lesions disappear within 3-4 days. The positive Fernandez reaction, like tuberculin reaction indicates delayed type of hypersensitivity to antigens of M. leprae or mycobacteria that cross-react with M. leprae. Positive reaction suggests that the patient has been infected by leprae bacilli during sometime in the past.Late or Mitsuda reaction is characterized by development of a nodule at the site of inoculation after 3-4 weeks of injection (Fig. 43-4). The nodule subsequently may undergo necrosis followed by ulceration. The ulcer takes several weeks to heal. Positive Mitsuda reaction is the manifestation of CMI, which indicates that the immune system is capable of inducing an efficient cell-mediated response. This Mitsuda reaction is positive in tuberculoid leprosy. Key Points The lepromin test is used mainly to: determine the type of leprosy, being positive (suggests resistance to disease) in tuberculoid leprosy and negative (suggests a lack of resistance to the disease) in lepromatous leprosy patients; monitor response of leprosy patients to treatment with chemotherapy. A positive reaction indicates a good prog-nosis while a negative test suggests a very bad prognosis; evaluate host resistance to leprosy.Examination by oil immersion fieldNumber of AFB Interpretation bacilli/10 in every 3/H11001 1 Field 10-100 bacilli in every field 4/H11001 1 Field 100-1000 bacilli in every field 5/H11001 1 The lepromin test is not used to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy. It is also not useful to indicate prior contact of the person with leprae bacilli. Healthy people residing in areas non-endemic for leprosy with no chance of contact with the bacilli may show a positive lepromin reaction. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis of leprosy is based on demonstration of antibodies to M. leprae, specific PGL-1 antigens. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination test are used to detect serum antibodies. The serology is useful primar-ily in patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy, as most (90%) of patients have higher levels of serum antibodies. The serology, however, is less useful for diagnosis of paucibacillary disease, because serum antibodies are present in only 40-60% of such patients. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying DNA that encodes 65- and 18-kDa M. leprae proteins and repetitive sequences of M. leprae is being used to detect and identify M. leprae in clinical specimens. PCR is used to monitor treatment, diagnose relapses, or determine the need for chemotherapy. The technique is most useful in cases of leprosy showing atypical clinical or histopathological features but positive for acid-fast bacilli. It is not useful for diagnosis of cases when acid-fast bacilli are not detected by light microscopy.Treatment The management of leprosy depends on treatment by chemo-therapeutic agents, immunotherapy, and physical, social, and psychological rehabilitation. Chemotherapy The goals of chemotherapy against leprosy are to (a ) stop infection, (b ) reduce morbidity, (c ) prevent complications, and (d ) eradicate the disease. Dapsone was the first effec- tive chemotherapeutic agent used against leprosy. Earlier it was used as a monotherapy, but it resulted in development of resistance against the drug by lepra bacilli. Hence since 1981, the World Health Organization (WHO) has advo-cated multiple drug therapy (MDT) against leprosy, as in tuberculosis.Multiple drug therapy (MDT) against leprosy: The MDT quickly decreases contagiousness of the disease, reduces relapse and reactions, and reduces disabilities. Moreover, MDT pre-vents dapsone resistance. The duration of treatment varies from 6 months to 2 years. The recommendations of WHO for treatment of leprosy in adults are as follows: 1. Single skin lesion: A single dose of the drug which includes rifampicin 600 mg, of loxacin 400 mg, and minocycline 100 mg. 2. Paucibacillary disease: Dapsone 100 mg daily and rifampi-cin 600 mg once a month giv en for 6 months. 3. Multibacillary disease: Rifampin (rifam picin) 600 mg once a month, dapsone 100 mg daily, clofazimine 300 mg once a month, and 50 mg daily are given for 1 year. A minimum 2 years follow-up for paucibacillary and 8 years for multibacillary cases is required to detect any relapse. Treatment schedule for children consists of dapsone (2 mg/kg) daily, clofazimine (6 mg/kg) once a month under supervision and 1 mg/kg daily self-administered, and rifampin (10 mg/kg) once a month. Reactions during treatment with MDT are a major problem. These reactions need urgent treatment, failing which they can give rise to irreversible deformities. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of anti-inflammatory measures are important. MDT is not stopped during reactions and continued at full doses without interruption. Immunotherapy Many immunotherapy agents have been evaluated for treat-ment of leprosy. These include immunomodulatory drugs, transfer factor, acetoacetylated M. leprae, and delipidified cell components of M. leprae. These agents have shown to enhance CMI, which results in increased killing and rapid clearing of dead lepra bacilli. Immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy has shown to be more beneficial, better toler-ated by patients, and is not associated with increased lepra reactions. FIG. 43-4.

III Chapter 43370 and Control The preventive and control measures include: (a) early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy and surveillance of contacts, (b) health education, (c) vaccines, and (d) chemoprophylaxis. Early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy and surveillance of contacts No skin or serologic tests are available to identify a carrier of leprosy. It is essential to monitor household contacts of patients with lepromatous disease annually for 5 years after diagnosis. Health education It is important in prevention and control of leprosy in popu lation. Vaccines Attempts have been made to develop and evaluate vaccines against leprosy. The antileprosy vaccines can be used as both immunoprophylactic and therapeutic agents. The vaccines that have been evaluated currently include the Mycobacterium The BCG vaccine has shown variable results in confer- ring protection against certain populations; therefore, it is not widely used. However, repeat immunization with BCG has shown to confer further protection. Both Mycobacterium w and Mycobacterium ICRC vaccines are used in India. Mycobacterium ICRC vaccine was prepared in 1979 and contains gamma-radiation-inactivated ICRC bacilli. Uses of these vaccines\u2014both in mouse model and human studies\u2014have shown better results. Chemoprophylaxis Many studies using one or more antileprosy drugs (dapsone, acedapsone, and rifampicin) as chemoprophylaxis against leprosy have failed to show any significant protection against leprosy. Therefore, at present, detection and MDT for all patients with leprosy is the useful method for early prevention of leprosy. Mycobacterium lepraemurium M. lepraemurium was first described by Stefansky as the caus-ative agent of leprosy in rats in 1901 at Odessa. The rat leprosy was found in 4-5% of slaughtered rats investigated during an attack of human plague. The condition, subsequently, has been documented with variable incidence from different countries of the world. M. lepraemurium resembles M. leprae and is found in the mononuclear cells of the subcutaneous tissues, lymph nodes, and in the nodules in the lungs and liver of the infected rat. However, both M. lepraemurium and M. leprae are not related species, and they differ from each other as shown by DNA studies. M. lepraemurium is cultivated with difficulty in Ogawa's egg-yolk medium (pH 5.8-6.3) at 37\u00b0C and also in rat fibro-blasts cell lines. M. lepraemurium in rats causes rat leprosy, which is characterized by two forms: glandular form and muscu-locutaneous form. Enlarged, hard, and whitish inguinal, axillary, and cervical lymph nodes are found in the glan-dular type, and ulceration and loss of hair are found in the musculocutaneous type. The bacteria do not cause disease in humans. A 25-year-old male attended Dermatology OPD and complained of hypopigmented patches on limbs and few on the but-tocks. On examination, the ulnar nerve was found to be tender and thickened. Skin and nasal secretion were nega-tive for acid-fast bacilli. Lepromin test was positive. The condition was diagnosed as leprosy. Diagnose the type of leprosy patient is suffering from. Describe the laboratory methods for diagnosis of the condition. Discuss the antibiotic regimen for treatment of the condition. Describe the vaccines available against the disease.CASE STUDY Chap-43.indd 370 5/14/2012 12:19:40 PM44 Introduction Spirochetes have been classified in the order Spirochaetales. They vary in size from 5 to 500 /H9262 m in length. Many of them are free-living saprophytes, while a few are obligate parasites. They may be aerobic, anaerobic, or facultative. Spirochetes show common morphological properties. They are thin, helical (0.1-0.5 /H11003 5-20 /H9262 m), and Gram negative. They are also elongated, motile, and flexible bacteria, twisted spirally along the long axis, giving these bacteria the name spirochetes (Spira meaning coiled, chait meaning hair). The presence of endoflagella is the characteristic feature of spirochetes. Endoflagella are the polar flagella situated between the outer membrane and cell wall, and are responsible for spiral shape and motility of the spirochetes. Spirochetes exhibit three types of motility: (a ) flexion and extension, (c ) translatory Spirochaetales is subdivided into two families: Spirochaetaceae and Leptospiraceae. genera Treponema and Borrelia include pathogenic species, which cause diseases in humans. Members of the genus Cristispira are found in molluscs, while Spirochetes are saprophytes found in sewage and water. Family Leptospiraceae contains only one genus Leptospira, which consists of species pathogenic to humans. The spirochetes causing disease in humans are summarized in Table 44-1. Treponema The generic name Treponema is derived from the Greek word Trepos, meaning to turn and nema, meaning thread. The trepo-nemes are short and slender spirochetes with fine spirals and pointed ends. Some of them are pathogenic for humans, while others occur as commensals in the mouth, intestine, and genitalia. Pathogenic members of the genus include Treponema pallidum (with three subspecies) and Treponema carateum. All these species: are morphologically identical, produce same serological responses in infected humans, and are sensitive to penicillin. These species, however, differ in their: clinical manifestations, natural history of the disease they cause, and epidemiological features. As for recent nomenclature and taxonomical studies, species T. pallidum consists of yaws, this book, T. pallidum subspp. palli- dum is referred to as T. the sake pallidum T. pallidum is the causative agent of syphilis, the most common sexually transmitted disease. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology T. pallidum shows the following morphological features: T. pallidum is a thin, coiled spirochete. It measures 0.1 /H9262m in breadth and 5-15 /H9262m in length. It has six to ten sharp and angular coils, which are present at regular interval of 1 /H9262m. It is actively motile. Endoflagella are responsible for motility of the bacteria. It shows three types of motility: flexion of the whole body, backward and forward movement, and rota-tion around the long axis. As the Treponema moves, it shows a series of secondary curves, which appear and disappear but its primary spiral structure remains unchanged. T. pallidum is too thin to be seen by microscopy in specimens stained by simple Gram or Giemsa staining. It is stained by silver impregnation method, which makes the bacteria Treponema, disease Leptospira PMSection III Chapter 44372 BACTERIOLOGY silver compounds during the pro- cess of staining. Levaditi's method (Fig. 44-1) and Fontana's method are the examples of silver impregnation staining methods, which are useful for staining tissue sections and blood films, respectively. Dark ground or phase contrast microscopy is useful for dem-onstrating the morphology and motility of live T. pallidum. T. pallidum on election microscopy shows a trilaminar cyto-plasmic membrane surrounded by a cell wall. The latter con-tains peptidoglycan that confers the cell its shape and rigid-ity. The cell wall is surrounded by an outer membrane layer. Three, occasionally four flagella known as endoflagella, responsible for motility of bacteria, originate from each end of the cell and extend toward the opposite end of the cell in the space between cell wall and outer membrane layer. These endoflagella do not extend beyond the cell wall outside but remain always confined within the outer membrane layer. Culture T. pallidum does not grow in artificial culture media. T. pallidum had been maintained for a long time by subculture in animals.Nichole's strain of T. pallidum : It is a pathogenic strain, which has been maintained for several decades by serial passage in rab- bit testes. This strain was isolated in 1913, originally from the brain of a fatal case of a patient with general paralysis of insane. This strain is most commonly used for diagnostic and research purposes in the laboratory. Strains of T. pallidum have been main- tained for a short period in cell lines, such as Eagle and McCoy cell lines supplemented with fetal bovine serum and reducing agent. Key Points phagedenis (earlier known as Reiter's examples of treponemes. These treponemes can be grown in Smith-Noguchi medium or in digest broth enriched with serum under strict anaerobic conditions. Reiter's strain is widely used for preparation of antigen for use in group-specific treponemal tests for diagnosis of syphilis. Other properties Sensitivity to physical and chemical agents: T. pallidum is a very delicate bacterium. It is readily killed by drying or heat-ing at 41-42\u00b0C for 60 minutes, at 0-4\u00b0C for 1-3 days. They are also readily killed on contact with distilled water, soap, arsenic compounds, mercuric compounds, bismuth compounds, and common antiseptics. T. pallidum strains can be preserved for laboratory use by many methods. It can be stored frozen in a medium containing 5% glycerol at 70\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen at /H11002130\u00b0C for 10-15 years. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure T. pallidum is antigenically complex. Infection by the bacteria induces production of at least three types of antibodies against (a) cardiolipin antigen, ( b) group-specific antigens, and Cardiolipin antigen The cardiolipin antigen is a hapten and is chemically a diphosphatidyl glycerol. This hapten elicits the production of an antibody, known as reagin antibody, in blood of patient suf-fering from syphilis. This cardiolipin antigen is demonstrated in T. pallidum, but it is not known whether the reagin antibody is produced by cardiolipin that is present in the treponema or by the cardiolipin that is released from damaged tissues following infection by treponema. Demonstration of the reaginic antibodies in the serum against the cardiolipin antigen forms the basis of standard non-specific tests for syphilis (e.g., VDRL, Kahn, and Wasserman). T. pallidum group-specific antigen T. pallidum group-specific antigen is protein in nature. It is found in T. pallidum as well as in nonpathogenic cultivable treponemes, such as Reiter's treponeme. This antigen induces the production of antibodies in the serum, which are found in patients with syphilis. Reiter's protein complex complement fixation test, a test used in syphilis serology, employs this anti-gen for detection of serum antibodies patients with syphilis. T. pallidum species-specific antigen Species-specific treponemal antigen is probably polysaccharide in nature. This antigen induces the development of antibodies, which can be detected in serum of the patients suffering from syphilis. The specific treponemal test, such as T. pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test, detects antibodies by using these antigens. Pathogenesis and Immunity T. pallidum is a strict human pathogen. Virulence factors The virulence of T. pallidum has recently been studied by clon-ing of T. pallidum genes in Escherichia coli and demonstrating pallidum LEPTOSPIRA 373 various proteins. Although many proteins have been isolated from pathogenic treponemes, the exact role of these pro-teins in pathogenesis of the disease still remains unclear. The possible virulence factors of T. pallidum include the following (Table 44-2):1. Outer membrane protein: Outer membrane protein of T. pallidum appears to play an important role in virulence of the bacteria. It promotes adherence of T. pallidum to the surface of host cells, thereby facilitating the infection.2. Enzyme hyaluronidase: This enzyme, produced by only facilitate perivascular infiltration.3. Fibronectin: Host cell fibronectin forms a coating on the surface of pathogenic Treponema, thereby preventing it from phagocytosis by macrophages. Pathogenesis of syphilis T. pallidum causes disease by invasion and multiplication at the site of infection, then spreading via circulation and producing disseminated disease. Immune response of the host is believed to be responsible primarily for tissue destruction and for caus-ing pathogenic lesions observed in patients with syphilis. On sexual contact, T. pallidum from infected partner is passed to another partner through intact mucous membrane or through minor skin abrasions. The organisms invade the skin at these lesions and multiply at the site of infection. Chancre is the primary lesion, which develops at the site of infection. Subsequently, the treponemes get transmitted in the blood stream and produce disseminated lesions (papular skin rashes, mucous patches in the oropharynx, etc.). During the course of infection, the condition may prog- ress to the late stage of the disease and possibly all tissues are affected by T. pallidum. Every stage of the disease\u2014whether pri-mary, secondary, or late\u2014represents localized multiplication of the treponemes and destruction of the tissues. Host immunity The treponemes rapidly penetrate the intact mucous membrane or minor skin abrasions and within a few hours enter the lym-phatics and blood to produce a systemic infection. Treponemal antigens induce the production of specific treponemal anti-bodies and nonspecific reaginic antibodies and relapsing fever. These also induce development of cell-mediated immunity. Immunity in syphilis is incomplete. For example, both humoral antibodies and cell-mediated immunity prevent the formation of chancre, a primary lesion on reinfection with T. pallidum, but they do not clear the organisms from the sites of infection. Their failure to kill the organism, possibly: is due to the presence of outer layer of the Treponema, which lack immunogenic molecules or it may be due to downregulation of helper T cells of the TH1 class. Clinical Syndromes T. pallidum causes following clinical syndromes: 1. Venereal syphilis (transmitted by sexual contact) 2. (congenital syphilis and occupational syphilis) Venereal syphilis Syphilis, if remains untreated, progresses through these dis-tinct characteristic stages as follows:Primary syphilis: This condition occurs within 3 weeks of sexual contact with an infected host. Chancre is the primary lesion seen during this stage of the disease (Fig. 44-2). It is a single or solitary lesion with a surrounding areola. The edge and base of the ulcer have a button-like consistency on pal-pation. The lesion occurs on penis or on scrotum of 75% of men and on the vulva, cervix, or perineum of more than 50% of women suffering from syphilis. The chancre is highly infec-tious. The exudates of T. pal-lidum bacteria.Secondary syphilis: Secondary syphilis occurs 2-10 weeks after the primary chancre and is most florid 3-4 months after infection. This stage of the disease is characterized by the Virulence factors Biological functions Outer membrane proteins Promote adherence of T. pallidum to the surface of host cells Enzyme hyaluronidase Facilitates perivascular infiltration Fibronectin Prevents FIG. and Leprology . 2nd III Chapter mucocutaneous lesions, which are discrete, macu-lar pink to red, and measure 3-10 mm in diameter. The cutaneous lesions may vary from macular to papular, pustular, and nodular type. The papules in the moist area of the skin of the body folds, especially about the anus (Color Photo 49) and genitalia, subsequently become broad, flat, and pink in color, leading to the formation of so-called condylomata lata. The lesions are found in the entire body including the palms, sole, and other sites. This condition is associated with mild symptoms of head- ache, nausea, fever, and pain in the bones. Painless generalized lymphadenopathy is seen in nearly 85% of the patients.Tertiary syphilis: The condition develops within 3-10 years of infection. Gumma is a typical pathological lesion found on the skin, in the mouth, and in the upper respiratory tract. Gummatous lesions may be multiple or diffuse, but are usually single lesions, which measure from 1 cm to sev-eral centimeters in diameter. This tertiary lesion contains few spirochetes and represents manifestations of delayed hypersensitivity. Cardiovascular syphilis, chronic granulomatous and menin- govascular manifestations, and neurosyphilis (Tabes dorsalis, general paralysis of insane) are the other manifestations of syphilis, which occur several decades after the infection. Nonvenereal syphilis Congenital syphilis and occupational syphilis are example of nonvenereal syphilis.Congenital syphilis: It is the most severe outcome of syphilis in humans. The infection occurs by vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy. If the mother is suffering from secondary syphilis and not treated for the same, a higher proportion of infants are affected compared to untreated early latent syphilis. In more than 40% of untreated mater-nal infection, T. pallidum causes late abortion, still birth, and death. Deaths in neonates may occur due to secondary bacte-rial infection, fulminant hepatitis, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The infants suffering from congenital syphilis are born usually without any overt clinical manifestation of the disease. Poor feeding and rhinitis may be the earliest signs of congeni-tal syphilis. Manifestations of the late onset congenital syphilis include neurosyphilis and involvement of the eighth cranial nerve, teeth, and bones.Occupational syphilis: It is a condition that may occur in medical and paramedical workers handling a case of secondary syphilis. The lesion develops usually on the palm of infected health workers and may also occur on other exposed body part. Epidemiology Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease found worldwide. Geographical distribution Syphilis occurs worldwide, mostly in large cities. The disease is extremely common in areas of dry, hot climates. Also, it is common in areas of poor economic status, education, and personal hygiene. The condition is prevalent in parts of Africa (e.g., Sudan, Southern Rhodesia, South Africa), parts of the Middle East (e.g., Nomadic/Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria), and parts of Asia (e.g., Turkey, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific) and India. Habitat T. pallidum inhabits the genital tract of infected males and females. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection T. pallidum is a strict human pathogen and does not naturally occur in any animal species. Humans are the only natural hosts. Infected human hosts secreting T. pallidum in serous tran-sudates from moist lesions, such as primary chancre, condy-loma latum, mucous patch, etc., are the sources of infection. Transmission of syphilis occurs: Primarily through sexual contact by inoculation of the spirochetes through mucosal membranes and abrasions on epithelial surfaces. By vertical transmission transplacentally. Vertical transmis-sion of early syphilis during pregnancy results in a congeni-tal infection in at least 50-80% of exposed neonates. By transfusion of T. pallidum-contaminated blood. Unprotected sex, promiscuous sex, and intravenous drug use are the major risk factors for syphilis. Doctors, nursing staff, and other healthcare workers are at occupational risk. Syphilis in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a problem increasingly recognized recently. Concomitant HIV and syphilis are common. Serological tests for syphilis may be modified by the presence of HIV, usu-ally resulting in extremely high antibody titers, which do not decrease in response to adequate treatment. Laboratory Diagnosis Since the clinical manifestations of the syphilis are protean, laboratory tests play an important role to confirm diagnosis of the disease. Specimens Specimens for microscopy include serous transudates from moist lesions, such as primary chancre, condyloma latum, mucous patch, etc. Serum is used for serodiagnosis, and cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) is used for diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Microscopy Dark-field microscopy is useful for diagnosis of primary, sec-ondary, or congenital syphilis by demonstration of treponemes in the clinical specimen. Dark-field microscopy is particularly helpful for diagnosis early in the disease before the appear-ance of serum antibodies. T. pallidum is identified by its slender spiral structure and slow movement. Dark-field microscopy, although useful, has many limitations. First, it is reliable only when examined by an experienced microscopist. Second, the method is of low sensitivity because as high as 10 4 bacteria/mL Chap-44.indd 374 5/14/2012 3:33:41 PMSection LEPTOSPIRA 375 of the exudates need to be present for demonstration by dark ground microscopy. Specimens from oral cavity cannot be used because sapro- phytic nonpathogenic treponemes are present as normal flora of the oropharynx. Direct antigen detection Direct fluorescent antibody T. pallidum (DFA-TP) is a sensitive and better method for direct detection of treponemal antigen in the exudates for diagnosis of syphilis. The test using fluores-cent-tagged T. pallidum antibodies is used to detect treponemal antigen directly in the acetone-fixed smears of the exudates. The test is 85-92% sensitive. Culture Since T. pallidum cannot be cultured on artificial medium, culture is not used for diagnosis of syphilis. Serodiagnosis Serology is the mainstay in the diagnosis of syphilis. It is exten-sively used for diagnosis of the condition in most of the labo-ratories. The serological test depending on the nature of the antigen used can be classified as (a) nontreponemal tests and (b) treponema-specific tests. Nontreponemal tests Nontreponemal tests are nonspecific serological tests used for the diagnosis of syphilis. These tests are also called standard tests of syphilis (STS). This group of tests use nontreponemal antigen (known as cardiolipin) and detect reagin antibodies. Key Points Reaginic antibodies The reaginic antibodies are produced against lipid anti-gens present on the surface of treponemes, or produced as a result of damage of the infected host cells during early stage of the disease. The reaginic antibodies appear 7-10 days after appearance of the primary chancre or 3-5 weeks after active infection in primary syphilis. The antibodies also develop in syphilitic patients with secondary and latent diseases. These antibodies do not appear in early primary syphilis, latent acquired syphilis of long duration, and late con-genital syphilis. Therefore, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and other tests may show false negative reactions during these conditions. Prozone phenomenon occurs (a) in approximately 2% of patients with secondary syphilis, (b) in patients with congeni-tal syphilis, and (c) in pregnant women. High level of reaginic antibodies in these conditions may give rise to false negative reaction with undiluted serum. Repeating the test with several dilutions of the patient serum excludes this phenomenon. Wasserman complement fixation test, Kahn's tube floccula- tion test, VDRL test, and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are the examples of STS.1. Wasserman complement fixation test : This was the first sero- logical test used in 1906 for serodiagnosis of syphilis. The test originally employed a watery extract of the lesion of a syphilitic fetus as the antigen. Subsequently, this antigen was substituted by an alcoholic extract of ox heart tissue supplemented with lecithin and cholesterol. This antigen was finally replaced by using cardiolipin antigen, a purified lipid extract of the bovine heart tissue supplemented with lecithin and cholesterol. The test, which was used as an important test in earlier days, now is no longer used.2. Kahn's tube flocculation test: This was the first flocculation test used by Kahn. But the test is no more used nowadays.3. VDRL test: VDRL test is a slide flocculation test used widely for the diagnosis of syphilis. The test is so named because it was developed first in the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, USPHS, New York. This is a simple and more rapid test, which uses cardiolipin antigen with added lecithin and cholesterol. In this test, the serum is inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and a measured volume of serum is placed on a special cav-ity slide. The cardiolipin antigen after preparation is added to serum sample on a slide and is rotated on a VDRL rotator for a specified period of 4 minutes. The reaction is read under a low-power objective of microscope. In a positive test, the car-diolipin antigen reacts with reagin antibodies present in the infected serum and forms visible clumps. In a negative test, car-diolipin continues to remain as uniform crystals in the serum. The result of the test is reported as reactive, weak reactive, or nonreactive depending on the extent of the formation of the clumps. The antibody titer of the serum can also be determined by testing on serial dilutions. The reciprocal of the end point is considered as the titer (for example reactive 8 dilutions or titer 8). VDRL test can also be performed on CSF samples. Unlike serum samples, CSF samples are not heated prior to the test. The VDRL test becomes positive 4-5 weeks after expo-sure to T. pallidum and 1-2 weeks after appearance of chancre. The VDRL test is a highly sensitive test. Sensitivity of the test depends on the stage of the disease: The test is 60-75% sensitive in primary syphilis. The titers of antibodies, however, are relatively low. The test is 100% sensitive in secondary syphilis, and the serum reaginic antibody titers vary between 16 and 128 or more. High antibody titers may be found in patients developing gummatous lesions and neurovascular or cardiovascular complications. The test is usually negative in tertiary or third stage of syphilis. This test is negative in early primary syphilis, latent acquired syphilis, and late congenital syphilis. Quantitation of the sera is useful to monitor activity of the disease and is of prognostic value. The quantitative estima-tion of reaginic antibodies is a good prognostic marker used for treatment of syphilis. A fourfold decrease in titer following therapy suggests adequate therapy, whereas a fourfold increase in titer of reaginic antibodies following therapy suggests reinfection BACTERIOLOGY The reaginic test becomes negative 1 year after successful therapy in primary syphilis, 2 years after successful therapy in sec-ondary or congenital syphilis, and 5 years after successful therapy in late syphilis. In some cases of neurosyphilis, this reaginic test may become negative with serum but positive with the CSF. The main disadvantage of VDRL test is that it shows biologi- cal false positive (BFP) reactions.Biological false positive reactions: BFP reactions are defined as pos-itive reactions observed with test using cardiolipin antigen but are negative with specific test using treponema antigen. These results are not due to technical faults. They represent antibody responses to nontreponemal cardiolipin antigens found in other tissues. BFP reactions are classified as acute or chronic reactions. The reactions that become negative within 6 months are called acute reactions, while those that are found for a lon-ger period are called chronic reaction. Acute BFP reactions are typically seen in (a) acute bacterial or viral infections, (b) injuries, or inflammatory conditions and (c) in early HIV infection. Chronic false positive reactions last for more than 6 months and are seen in (a) patients with parenteral drug use, (b) autoimmune or connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, (c) aging, and (d) hypergammaglobu-linemia, (e) also seen in other infectious conditions, such as tropical eosinophilia, malaria, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, leprosy, and relapsing fever (Table 44-3). The BFP reactions can usually be ruled out by using trepo-nema-specific test. The VDRL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): It is a modification of VDRL test which is being used to detect both IgM and IgG antibodies separately in the patient serum. This test is used mainly for large-scale screening of patient serum.4. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test : RPR test is a popular test used for diagnosis of syphilis by demonstrating reaginic antibodies. The test uses VDRL antigen containing finely divided carbon par-ticles suspended in choline chloride. The latter destroys inhibitory factors in the serum, thus avoiding the need to heat the serum before testing. Use of this antigen produces a clearer and well-defined flocculation reaction easily observed by the naked eye. The RPR test is used for testing serum or plasma, but not for the CSF. Automated reagin test is a modification of RPR test which is used for screening of large number of serum samples. Treponema-specific tests The Treponema-specific tests measure antibodies specific for T. pallidum. These tests use (a) live T. pallidum strains (T. pallidum immobilization test), (b) killed T. pallidum ( T. pallidum aggluti- nation test, T. pallidum immune adherence test, and fluorescent treponemal antibody test), or (c) T. pallidum extracts test was the first specific treponemal test, which was introduced in 1949. This test detects the treponemal antibodies in patient's serum, which immobilize motile virulent T. pallidum. The test is performed by incubating live T. pallidum strains with test serum in the presence of complement. If the serum contains treponemal antibodies, the treponemes become immobilized, which can be demonstrated under dark ground microscope. The test when introduced was the most specific serological test for diagnosis of syphilis. But because of its complexity and difficulty in maintaining live treponemal strains, this test is no longer used and is replaced by newer tests, such as TPHA and fluorescent pallidum suspension inactivated by formalin. The test is performed by mixing the formalin inactivated suspension of T. pallidum with patient's serum. If antibodies are present in the serum, it leads to agglutination of treponemal antigen, which can be demonstrated by dark ground microscopy. However, the test is no longer used, because it is non-specific and is associated with false positive reactions.T. pallidum immune adherence test: In this test, a suspension of inactivated treponemes is incubated with test serum, complement, and fresh heparinized whole blood from normal individuals. If antibodies are present, treponemes are found to adhere to the erythrocytes. If antibodies are absent, the treponemes do not adhere to the erythrocytes. This test is also not used nowadays.Fluorescent treponemal antibody test: FTA test is the most specific and popular test used for diagnosis of syphilis. FTA is an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test, which uses acetone fixed smears of T. pallidum on the slides. The test is performed by adding a drop of test serum to the smear on the slide followed by washing and re-incubating the smear with fluorescent labeled antihuman immunoglobulin. The slide is examined under a fluorescence microscope. Demonstration of fluorescent treponemes is suggestive of a positive FTA test. FTA absorption (FTA-Abs) is a modification of FTA test, which shows high sensitivity and specificity. In this test, patient's serum is first absorbed with a sonicated extract T. phagedenis ( Reiter's treponeme) to remove group-specific antibodies. The test is almost as specific as the TPI test and is considered as a standard reference test in syphilis serology. Acute BFP reactions Acute bacterial or viral infections Injuries or inflammatory conditions Early HIV infection Chronic false positive reactions Patients with parenteral drug use Autoimmune or connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus Aging Patients with hypergammaglobulinemia Other infectious conditions, such as tropical eosinophilia, malaria, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, leprosy, and relapsing feverTABLE 44-3Biological false positive reactions standard tests 5/14/2012 3:33:41 is primary syphilis, 100% secondary syphilis, and 95% tertiary syphilis. The test is highly specific (92-99%). The test shows occasional false positive reactions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cirrhosis, and hypergammaglobulinemia. The IgM FTA-Abs test is another modification of FTA-Abs used to detect serum IgM antibodies in congenital syphilis. This test is used to differentiate seropositivity due to passively transferred IgG maternal antibodies to the fetus from IgM anti-bodies found in utero extract of T. pallidum as antigen. TPHA is now been modified to perform in microtiter plates and is referred to as microtiter hemagglutination T. pallidum (MHA-TP) test. This test is performed by incubating the serial dilution of the patient's serum with erythrocytes sensitized with T. pallidum antigen in a microtiter plate. If antibodies are present, hemagglutination of RBCs occur (Fig. 44-3, Color Photo 50). The serum samples before testing for TPHA are reabsorbed with a diluent containing Reiter's and sheep erythrocytes. Key Points TPHA TPHA is as specific as FTA-Abs but less sensitive than FTA-Abs in primary syphilis. It is also equally sensitive to FTA-Abs in secondary and late syphilis. After successful therapy, the hemagglutinating antibodies continue to persist in the serum for a longer time; hence this test is of no prognostic value. The negative TPHA virtually excludes diagnosis of syphilis except during early stage of the disease and also eliminates the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. TPHA is the most widely used treponemal test available commercially. It is simple, economical, and does not require any expensive sophisticated equipment.Enzyme immunoassay: EIA uses ultrasonicated T. pallidum antigen coated on tubes or ferrous metal beads as solid-phase carrier for antigen. The serum antibodies are detected by an enzymatic reaction. The test is available commercially. All the treponemal tests are not completely specific for syphilis. They also show false positive reactions in patients with other spirochetal diseases, such as leptospirosis, relapsing fever, Lyme disease, pinta, yaws, and rat-bite fever. The sensitivity of common tests performed for the diagnosis of syphilis is summarized in Table 44-4. The test accuracy of various diagnostic methods in syphilis is presented in Table 44-5. Treatment Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of all the stages of syphilis. A single intramuscular dose of benzathine penicillin G (50,000 units/kg, not to exceed 2.4 million units) is effective for treatment of primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis. No reports of T. pallidum showing resistance to penicillin have been documented. Doxycycline or tetracycline may be used for non-pregnant patients allergic to penicillin. Jarish-Herxheimer reac- tion is a noted complication observed following therapy with antibiotics. It is characterized by chills, rigors, and increase in temperature, decrease in blood pressure, and tachycardia. This reaction occurs due to production of endotoxin and other toxic products released following rapid killing and lysis of the bacteria. Prevention and Control Avoidance of sexual contact with infected partners avoids trans-mission of infection. Use of condoms during sexual intercourse or antiseptics (such as potassium permanganate) or prophylac-tic use of antibiotics may minimize the risk of transmission of the disease. The use of penicillin prophylaxis, however, carries the danger that it may suppress the primary lesion without eliminating the infection. Nonvenereal Treponematosis The condition includes three distinct entities, such as endemic syphilis, yaws, and pinta. These conditions are found in several parts of the world associated with poor socioeconomic condi-tion and poor is a nonvenereal treponemal infection reported from different parts of the world. The condition, also known as Bejel in the Middle East, njovera in Zimbabwe, dichuchwa in Bechuanaland, Skerjevo in Eastern Europe, and siti in Zambia, is caused by T. pallidum subspp. endemicum. The condition has also been documented from India. The disease is transmitted from person-to-person by the use of contaminated utensils. The disease is commonly seen in young children. The initial lesions, such as primary chancre, are rarely seen. Secondary manifestations of syphilis are usually seen, which include lesions like oral papules and mucosal patches. Late manifestations of the disease include gummatous lesions of skin, bones, and nasopharynx. The laboratory diagnosis and treat-ment of endemic syphilis are similar to those of venereal syphilis. Yaws Yaws is a nonvenereal treponemal disease caused by T. pertenue. The condition also known as Pian, Parangi, etc., is prevalent in the primitive tropical parts of central Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The condition is also documented in India from Andhra Pradesh and Madhya T. pallidum. The pathogen causes yaws, which is characterized by an extragenital papule, which subsequently enlarges and breaks down to form an ulcerating granuloma. Late manifestations of the disease include destructive lesions of the skin, bone, and lymph nodes. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with infected skin lesions. Laboratory diagno-sis and treatment are similar to that of venereal syphilis. Pinta Pinta is a contagious disease of the skin caused by T. carateum . Pinta, also known as carate, mal del pinto, is endemic in Central and South America and the neighboring islands. An extragenital papule is the primary skin lesion observed in the condition. Small pruritic papules develop on surface of the skin after an incubation period of 1-3 weeks. These lesions do not ulcerate, but enlarge and persist for months to years before resolving. The condition, if remains untreated, progresses to form disseminated recurrent and hypopigmented lesions leading to scarring and disfigurement. Pinta spreads by direct contact with infected lesions. Laboratory diagnosis and treatment are same as for syphilis. Nonpathogenic Treponemes Nonpathogenic treponemes are a as commensals on the buccal and genital mucosa. They are also found on the surface of gastric and colonic epithelium in humans and animals. These an oral treponeme, which is easily cultivable on artificial medium. T. phagedenis is also known as Reiter's and Kazan strain, and T. refringens is also known as Nichol's strain. Borrelia Borreliae are Gram-negative bacilli, which are larger than other spirochetes. They measure 0.2-0.5 /H9262m in breadth and 3-30 /H9262m in length. They are motile and stained readily with aniline dye, such as Giemsa and Wright stain. The genus Borrelia consists of many species, which are found as commensals on buccal and genital mucosa. Members of the genus Borrelia cause two important diseases in humans: Epidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever is caused by Borrelia recurrentis, whereas endemic relapsing fever is caused by as many as 15 species of Borrelia. recurrentis B. recurrentis is the causative agent of relapsing fever, which manifests as one or more relapses of fever after the subsidence of primary paroxysm of fever.Diagnostic test Method Test accuracy Microscopy Dark field microscopy Less sensitive; test is reliable when examined immediately Direct fluorescent antibody method Highly specific Serology VDRL Sensitivity high in secondary stage and less in primary stage and late syphilis RPR Sensitivity high in secondary stage and less in primary stage and late syphilis FTA-Abs Highly specific and sensitive TPHA Highly specific and sensitive Molecular methods Polymerase chain reaction Specific; helps to distinguish between the various subspecies of T. pallidum DNA amplification Specific VDRL, Venereal Chapter 379 Properties of the Bacteria Morphology B. recurrentis shows the following morphological features: B. recurrentis has an unequal spiral-shaped structure with one or both the ends pointed. It measures 8-20 /H9262m in length and 0.2-0.4 /H9262m in breadth. It possesses 15-20 endoflagella per cell and 5-10 loose uneven spiral coils. The spiral coils are coarser and more irregular than those of treponemes and leptospires. It is Gram negative. It can be stained by Wright and Giemsa stain for demonstration by microscope. It is actively motile in fresh blood preparation, moves in forward and backward waves, and exhibits cork-screw like motility. Culture Borrelia is microaerophilic. The bacteria grow at optimum tem-perature of 28-30\u00b0C. They have complex nutritional require-ments, hence are difficult to grow on artificial media. They can grow in chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo. Mice or rats are highly susceptible to infection. Primary isolation of bacteria from clinical specimens can be made by intraperi-toneal inoculation of specimens in these laboratory animals. After inoculation, borreliae appear early in the blood and also are found in the brain for a longer time. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Antigenic variation is a unique property exhibited by Borrelia in humans. DNA rearrangement in linear plasmid present in Borrelia appears to be responsible: For antigenic variations shown by the bacteria and For causing relapse, characteristically seen in the relapsing fever caused by the bacteria. Pathogenesis and Immunity B. recurrentis is an invasive bacterium. It enters the skin and causes disease. Virulence factors The ability of B. recurrentis to undergo antigenic shift and escape from immune clearance of the host is the main virulence factor attributed to the bacteria. The antigenic shift or antigenic varia-tions exhibited by the bacteria are primarily responsible for peri-odic febrile and afebrile stages observed in the relapsing fever. Pathogenesis of relapsing fever B. recurrentis penetrates the skin, reaches the blood circulation and invades various organs in the body and cause the disease. After invasion of blood by bacteria, Borrelia-specific IgM antibodies agglutinate Borrelia and cause complement- mediated lysis. This leads to rapid clearing of Borrelia from the blood stream. Borrelia present in the internal tissue alters their serotype-specific outer proteins through gene rearrangement and exhibits a new antigen. The IgM antibodies produced against old antigens are not effective against the Borrelia pathogens exhibiting new antigenic variation. The host immunity responds again by producing specific antibodies against these new antigens and clears the organism from the circulation. Patients recover after a number of relapses due to development of humoral immunity. Host immunity Host immunity is characterized by the development of specific humoral immunity against Borrelia. The humoral immunity contributes to recovery in a patient after a number of relapses. Clinical Syndromes fever. manifestations of epidemic louse-borne and endemic tick-borne relapsing fever are essentially similar. The incuba-tion period is usually 7 days. Two or more episodes of high fever, headache, and myalgia are the hallmarks of the disease. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are the associated symptoms. These symptoms correspond to the bacteremic phase of the disease when Borrelia is found in large numbers in patient's blood (Fig. 44-4). The fever subsides after 3-7 days when the Borrelia is cleared from the circulation. After an afebrile period of 4-7 days, bac-teremia occurs and fever reappears. The Borrelia reappears in the blood during relapse of the fever. The condition ultimately subsides after 3-10 relapses. Key Points Relapsing fever A single relapse is the characteristic of epidemic louse-borne disease and is usually associated with high morbidity of 4-50%. Repeated relapses are common in endemic tick-borne dis-eases and are usually associated with low mortality of less than 5%. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Epidemic louse-borne relapsing fever now has disappeared with improvement in hygiene and the use of insecticides. It is an important disease only in north-eastern Africa, especially in the islands of Ethiopia and in South America. Endemic tick-borne relapsing fever has worldwide distribution and is endemic in western states of the United States. Chap-44.indd 379 5/14/2012 3:33:42 PMSection III Chapter 44380 BACTERIOLOGY Habitat B. recurrentis is found in the blood stream and also in the spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, and bone marrow of the infected patients suffering from relapsing fever. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the only reservoir of epidemic relapsing fever. No extra-human reservoir is known. The infection is transmitted only from person to person. Persons suffering from relapsing fever are the source of infection. Human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis) is the vector of the disease. No extrahuman reservoir is known. The Borrelia organisms are found only in the hemolymph of the lice. They are not excreted in saliva or excreta. Hence, the infection is transmitted by them being crushed and rubbed into the absorbed skin. They are not transmitted by bite of the lice. Endemic tick-borne relapsing fever is a zoonotic disease trans-mitted from animals to humans, rodents, small mammals. Soft ticks (Ornithodoros species) are the main vectors of the disease. Unlike the louse-borne infection, B. recurrentis pro-duces a disseminated infection in ticks. However, the vector survives from the infection and becomes reservoir of the infec-tion by transovarian transmission. The Borrelia organisms are found in all parts of the body of tick; hence, they are secreted in the saliva and in excreta. Therefore, the infection is transmitted to human by the bite of the ticks. Several species of the genus Ornithodoros act as reservoir in different parts of the world. Ornithodoros tholozani, Ornithodoros crossi, Ornithodoros lahorensis, and the fowl persicus are the vectors in India. Soft ticks are primarily nocturnal feeders. They feed while the host is sleeping and remain attached for only a few minutes. Hence, the bite of the tick goes usually unnoticed.Laboratory Diagnosis Specimen Blood collected from a patient during fever, but not from afebrile patient, is a useful specimen. Microscopy A wet mount preparation of the blood examined by dark-field or phase contrast microscopy is a useful method for direct observation of Borrelia. The organisms are identified by their dashing movements. Borrelia organisms can also be demonstrated in peripheral blood smear stained with Giemsa or Wright stains. Staining is the most sensitive method for diagnosis of 70% or more patients of louse-borne relapsing fever. Culture Cultures are not carried out routinely for isolation of Borrelia from clinical specimens. This is because Borrelia organisms have complex nutritional requirements for their growth and they grow very slowly on these media. Animal inoculation Animal inoculation is a more sensitive method. This test is per-formed by inoculating a mouse intraperitoneally with 1-2 mL of blood from the infected patient. The blood is collected from the tail vein of the mice after 1-10 days. Blood is examined for the presence of Borrelia daily for 2 weeks.1 2 3ExposureTemperatureSpecific antibody producedWeeks Sweating, weakness Rigor Headache MyalgiaRigor Headache MyalgiaRigor Headache MyalgiaSweating, weakness Borrelia in blood undergoes antigenic phase variation; hence, serological tests are not useful in the diagnosis of the condition. Treatment Tetracycline or erythromycin is most effective for treatment of relapsing fever. Doxycycline is usually recommended for chil-dren and pregnant women. Prevention and Control Prevention of louse infiltration and the use of insecticide are the measures that prevent louse-borne relapsing fever. Prevention of tick-borne relapsing fever consists of wearing protective clothings, use of insect repellants, and avoidance of ticks and their natural habitat. No vaccine is available for relapsing fever. Borrelia vincenti B. vincenti is a m in length and 0.2-0.6 /H9262 m in breadth. It is Gram negative and is usu- ally stained with Giemsa and Leishman stain. B. vincenti is an obligate anaerobe found as normal commensal in the mouth. The bacteria under certain predisposing conditions (such as malnutrition and viral infections) produce a condition known as Vincent's angina. Vincent's angina is fusiform bacilli (Fusobacterium fusiforme). It is characterized by formation of ulcer on the mouth and on tonsillar areas. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by demon- stration of B. vincenti and fusiform bacilli in stained smears of exudate from the lesion. This bacterium is grown with diffi-culty on enriched media anaerobically. Penicillin and metronidazole are effective for treatment of the condition. Borrelia burgdorferi B. burgdorferi, a newly identified Borrelia species, is the causative agent of Lyme disease. Lyme disease was first demonstrated in children in 1975, during an outbreak of arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut, in the United States. The causative agent of the fever was isolated by Burgdorfer in 1982 after whom the spe-cies burgdorferi is named. B. burgdorferi is a fastidious bacterium, which measures 4-30 /H9262m in length and 0.2 /H9262m in breadth. It is helical and Gram negative. It is a microaerophilic spiro-chete, which can be grown on BSK (Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly) medium at 33\u00b0C after incubation for 2 weeks or longer. Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks. The incubation period varies from 7 to 14 days. After bite of the tick, B. burgdorferi is inoculated through the skin and then spreads locally. The local spread of the bacteria causes erythema migrans, a rash seen in approximately two thirds of the cases. This skin rash may be a confluent patch of erythema or may have central clearing. The lesion begins as a small macular papule and becomes larger over the next many weeks and forms a large area of lesion of 5-50 cm in diameter. The patient may also complain of fever, chills, myalgias, and headache during early stage of the disease, with or without rash. Subsequently, during a period of time ranging from days to months, the bacteria spread through blood circulation and cause a disseminated disease. This disease is characterized by the presence of multiple erythema migrans, systemic complica-tions (fever, myalgias, arthralgia, malaise, and headache) and even septic meningitis; this disease usually develops 3-10 weeks after the tick bite. The pathogenesis of these late manifesta-tions is poorly understood. It is not known whether the live organisms cause these manifestations or these manifestations occur due to an antigenic cross-reactivity to Borrelia antigens. Lyme disease has been reported from USA, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. Lyme disease is a zoonotic disease. Rodents, bear, and other mammals are the natural reservoir hosts. Hard ticks (ixodid ticks) are the vectors of the disease. The infection is transmitted by the hard tick from mice to humans and occur by regurgita-tion during tick bite. Individuals exposed to hard ticks are at increased risk for Lyme disease. Clinical diagnosis of the condition may be made by the presence of erythema migrans in the early stage of the disease. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is primarily serological. Serodiagnosis depends on demonstration of specific antibod-ies in the serum, which persist for many years even after eradi-cation of the infection. ELISA and IIF are the most common serological tests employed for the diagnosis of the disease. Western blot is used to confirm the specificity of serum pos-itive by ELISA or IIF. Serology is positive in one-third of the patients with the early disease, in 90% of patients with early disseminated disease, and in all the patients with late disease. Microscopy is not recommended because B. burgdorferi is rarely seen in clinical specimens. Culture is also not used, because the bacteria are difficult to culture. Amoxicillin, tetracycline, cefuroxime, or ceftriaxone are effective for the treatment of Lyme disease. Avoidance of exposure to ticks and use of insecticides are the useful methods for prevention of the disease. Leptospira Leptospires are finely coiled, thin, motile, and obligate aerobes. Their flagella help them to burrow deep into infected tissues. Classification The leptospires belong to the genus Leptospira, the family Leptospiraceae, and the order Spirochaetales. The nomencla-ture and taxonomy of the Leptospira has undergone a lot of revisions, making review of the literature often confusing. Chap-44.indd 381 5/14/2012 3:33:42 PMSection III Chapter 44382 BACTERIOLOGY Traditionally, the genus Leptospira has been grouped by serological properties and by their pathogenicity into two spe-cies: the pathogenic Leptospira interrogans and nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa. On the basis of shared antigens, these species were further divided into serogroups, serovars, and strains. Pathogenic species, L. interrogans currently includes more than 250 serovars. However, the classification is not consistent with recent classification based on nucleic acid analysis. The current classification based on nucleic acid analysis divides L. interrogans and L. biflexa complex into 12 species. These species are further subdivided into serogroups, serovars, and strains on the basis of microscopic agglutination tests (MAT): L. interrogans complex includes pathogenic leptospires that cause leptospirosis. L. biflexa consists of nonpathogenic leptospires and includes more than 63 serovars. L. biflexa is so called because of its double curved structure (Biflexa: twice bend). These are mostly free-living saprophytes found in moist environmental areas but are not associated with disease in humans and animals. Leptospira interrogans Complex L. interrogans complex includes pathogenic leptospires that cause leptospirosis. The disease, often referred to as swamp fever, mud fever, or swine herd's disease, is the most common zoonosis in the world. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology L. interrogans shows the following morphological features: L. interrogans are thin, delicate, coiled spirochetes measuring 6-20 /H9262m length and 0.1 /H9262 m in breadth. They are actively motile by means of two periplasmic flagella, each present at opposite end of the bacteria by continually spinning on the long axes. They possess tightly coiled spirals and hooked ends, resem-bling the handle of an umbrella. They stain poorly with aniline dyes but stain well with silver impregnation methods, such as Levaditi's (Fig. 44-5) and Fontana's method of staining. Culture L. are obligate aerobes. They use fatty acids and alco-hols as source of carbon and energy. They grow at an optimum temperature of 25-30\u00b0C and optimum pH of 7.2-7.5. Key Points Leptospires are unique spirochetes\u2014they can be grown in artificial medium. They grow on special media enriched with rabbit serum or bovine serum albumin. Korthoff's medium, Stuart's medium, and Fetcher's medium are frequently used media for culture of Leptospira. Ellinghausen, McCullough, Johnson, and Harris (EMJH) medium is a semisynthetic medium commonly used nowa-days for the culture of leptospira. Leptospira can be grown on the chorioallantoic membrane of 10-20 days' old chick embryo. The bacteria are demonstrated in the blood of the allantoic sac 4-5 days' after inoculation. Animal inoculation is a useful method for obtaining pure culture of Leptospira. The bacteria are inoculated intraperito-neally in guinea pigs followed by collection of blood from the heart 10 minutes after inoculation. Culture of the heart blood yields pure colonies of L. interrogans. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Leptospira are readily killed by heating at 50\u00b0C for 10 minutes and at 60\u00b0C for 10 seconds. They are destroyed by acidity of gastric juice in 30 minutes and also by the bile. They are also readily destroyed by chlorine and commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants. They die rapidly in acidic urine, in salty or brackish water, and in nonaerated sewage. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Leptospira organisms show a considerable degree of antigenic cross-reactivity. A genus-specific somatic antigen is present in all Leptospira; on the basis of which, leptospires are classified into serogroups and serotypes. This has been divided further on the basis of DNA homology into serogroups, serovars, strains, etc. Pathogenesis and Immunity L. interrogans is an invasive bacterium. Virulence factors Direct invasion and multiplication in the blood and tissue is the main virulence determinant of Leptospira. Although direct inva-sion of leptospires may cause tissue damage, it is now observed Fontana's stain showing Leptospira FIG. 44-5. LEPTOSPIRA 383 that the degree of multiorgan tissue injury does not correlate with number of leptospira in infected tissues. Therefore, it is suggested that other factors, such as the endotoxin, hemolysin, and lipase, may also contribute to pathogenicity of Leptospira. However, the exact virulence factors of leptospira are not known. The factors responsible for causing injury to host tissues remain unclear and appear to be a complex interaction of many factors. Pathogenesis of leptospirosis The severity of the leptospirosis depends on (a) host immunity, (b) virulence of infecting strain, and (c) the number of infect-ing leptospires. After Leptospira enters the body through various sites, it multiplies in blood and tissues, resulting in leptospirae-mia. Leptospira can spread to any part of the body, but affects primarily the liver and kidney. In the kidney, the bacterium causes interstitial necrosis and tubular necrosis. Subsequently, the bacterium causes tubular damage, hypovolemia due to dehydration, and altered capillary permeability causing renal failure. In the liver, it caus es centrilobular necrosis and hepa-tocellular dysfunction leading to jaundice. Leptospira may also invade skeletal muscle, causing edema and focal necrosis. Host immunity Humoral immunity plays an important role in clearance of leptospires from the circulation. Immune reactions of the host to leptospira appears to be responsible for many complica-tions, such as meningitis and other clinical manifestations seen during the later stage of the disease. Clinical Syndromes L. interrogans causes leptospirosis, which occurs as anicteric leptospirosis and icteric leptospirosis. The incubation period varies from 2 to 30 days, but is usually about 10-14 days. Anicteric leptospirosis Approximately, 90% of infections with L. interrogans manifest as a mild anicteric (absence of jaundice) form of the disease. These clinically inapparent infections are diagnosed only by demon-stration of specific leptospira antibodies in the patient serum. Icteric leptospirosis Approximately 10% of the patients develop icteric manifesta-tions of the disease, otherwise known as Weil's disease. The disease is characterized by the development of jaundice. The disease shows two distinct phases: septicemic and immune (leptospuric). These two phases of illness are continuous and indistinguishable. First stage is the septicemia or leptospiremia stage . This stage is so called because during this phase, Leptospira organ-isms are usually isolated from the blood, CSF, and most tissues by culture. This stage is characterized by a nonspecific influenza-like illness with fever and myalgias. This phase lasts for 4-7 days. The first stage is followed by 1-3 days' period of improvement during which the temperature falls down and the patient becomes afebrile and relatively asymptomatic. Immune or leptospuric stage: The second stage starts with the recurrence of fever. This stage is called immune or leptospuric stage, because circulating antibodies may be detected in serum or leptospira may be isolated from the urine, but not from blood or CSF. This stage occurs as a result of body's immune response to infection. This stage is character-ized by the diseases affecting specific organs, such as meninges, liver, kidney, and eye. Aseptic meningitis is the most important clinical mani- festation. Profound jaundice, renal dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, hepatic necrosis, and hemorrhagic diastases are other severe manifestations. Mortality is very high (5-10%) with Weil's syndrome. It may be as high as 22% in cases of Weil's syndrome associated with hepatorenal involvement and jaundice, and in older patients. Epidemiology Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic bacterial disease throughout the world. Geographical distribution Leptospirosis is distributed worldwide, occurring with the greatest frequency in the tropics. This is not found in the polar regions. The condition is much more common in the Cannabian islands, the Pacific islands, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia including India. Habitat In an infected host, leptospires are found to multiply in blood and any organ of the body but most commonly in the liver, kidney, and meninges. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Wild mammals are the pri-mary reservoirs of infection. Leptospires infect as many as 160 mammalian species including rats, dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, rac-coons, and other animals. Rodents are most important res-ervoirs, and rats are the most common source of infection worldwide. Leptospirosis in animals is usually a subclinical infec-tion. Leptospires are found for a long period in kidney of these animals; as a result, animals excrete a large number of leptospires in their urine without showing any evidence of clinical disease. Urine of the infected animals containing a large number of leptospires is the most important source of infection. Direct contact with the infected urine or urine-contaminated inani-mate objects results in human infections. Animal bedding, soil, mud, and aborted tissues are examples of such inanimate objects contaminated with infected urine. The infection is transmitted to humans: Through intact mucous membrane or conjunctiva; Through minor abrasions on the surface of the skin, water-logged skin, Chap-44.indd 383 5/14/2012 of aerosolized body fluids; and By congenital infection (from infected mother to fetus through placenta). The leptospires survive in soil for as many as 24 days and in fresh water for as many as 30 days. Differences between lepto-spires and treponemes are summarized in Table 44-6. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Blood, urine, and CSF are used most commonly for demonstra-tion of leptospires by microscopy or culture. Microscopy Dark-field microscopy is employed for direct demonstration of motile leptospires in wet mount preparation of blood speci-men. The method is useful for detection of leptospires in the blood specimens early in the disease, but not in the late stage. The dark-field microscopy, however, is relatively insensitive and also shows false positive results. Protein filaments from eryth-rocytes and other blood artifacts can be easily mistaken for Leptospira. Gram stain or silver impregnation staining methods are not useful to detect leptospires. Antigen detection Direct fluorescent antibody assay is available for detection of leptospira antigen directly in blood or CSF. The method, how-ever, is not widely used due to difficulty in availability of this test. Culture Isolation of the organism in culture of blood, CSF, and urine establishes the specific diagnosis of leptospirosis. The positiv-ity of the culture depends upon the time of collection of blood: Blood culture may be negative if collected too early or too late. Positivity is possible if the specimen is collected 4 days after the onset of symptoms. CSF culture is positive when specimen is collected within first 10 days, and urine culture remains positive for several weeks after the initial infection. The specimens are cultured on Fetcher's, Stuart's, or EMJH media supplemented with neomycin and 5-fluorouracil. The culture bottles are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days and thereafter in the dark, at room temperature for 2 weeks. The cultures are examined every third day for leptospires by examining in dark ground microscope. Primary isolation requires a longer period of incubation for many weeks to months. The identification of leptospira isolates is made by agglu- tination tests using type-specific sera. The identification of isolates in particular serogroups, serovars, etc., is cumbersome, hence is not carried out in routine laboratories, but at reference laboratories. Animal inoculation Leptospires can be isolated by animal inoculation. Blood is the usual specimen, which is inoculated intraperitoneally into young guinea pigs. If blood contains virulent L. interrogans, the guinea pig develops fever, jaundice, and dies within 8-12 days with hemorrhages into the veins and serous cavities. Serodiagnosis Serological tests are increasingly used for diagnosis of leptospi-rosis. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the traditional gold standard, available only at reference laboratories, for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis.MAT: This test depends on the ability of the patient's serum to agglutinate live leptospires obtained by culture. The MAT test uses a battery of live leptospires serovars commonly prevalent in the area endemic for the disease. The MAT uses a battery of antigens taken from common (frequently locally endemic) leptospire serovars prepared from the leptospire strains cultured on the media. The test is performed by mixing the leptospira antigen with serial dilutions of patient's sera and interval; ends of the spirals are pointedTightly coiled regular spirals with hooked ends; the interval and amplitude of spirals is 0.5 /H9262m each Number of endoflagella 3-4 at each pole 1 at each pole Motility Actively motile with flexion and extension; translatory and cork-screw like rotatory motilityRotation around long axis forward and backward and bending and flexion Mode of infection Sexual contact, intimate cutaneous contact, blood transfusion, and transplacentalWater contaminated with rodent urine suggestive of leptospirosis. A fourfold rise in convalescent serum is also considered positive. The MAT is highly sensitive (92%) and specific (95%). The MAT shows false negative reaction with serum speci-mens collected in immune phase of the disease and in patients treated with antibiotics. The MAT may show false positive reactions with serum from the cases of Lyme disease, Legionella infection, and syphilis. Other serological tests: There is another group of sero-logical tests, which detect serum-specific antibodies without the exact infective serovars. Nonpathogenic L. biflexa Patoc I strain is employed as antigen in these tests. Examples of such tests are the microscopic slide agglutination test, indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), the leptospirosis immuno-globulin test, and the Leptospira immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA. IgM ELISA is of value for diagnosing new infections within 3-5 days. IHA is also rapid and simple method for diagnosis of the condition. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of leptospirosis. The test is yet to be avail-able for routine use. Diagnostic tests for leptospirosis are summarized in Table 44-7. Treatment Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of treatment of leptospirosis. Oral doxycycline is the drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated Leptospira infection, not requir-ing hospitalization. Intravenous penicillin or ampicillin is recommended for hospitalized patients. Streptomycin, tetracycline, or erythromycin is indicated for patients allergic to penicillin.Prevention and Control Preventive measures include detection of cases and detection of common source of infection. Disinfection of water supplies, rodent control, and wearing of protective clothings control transmission of the disease. Leptospire infection in livestock is controlled by improved sanitation, immunization of animals, and proper veterinary care. Recently, human vaccines are available against leptospiro- sis. These vaccines are recommended only for high-risk work-ers. These vaccines are serovar specific and usually given every year.Diagnostic test Method Test accuracy Microscopy Gram stain Organisms too thin to be detected Dark field examination Insensitive, nonspecificSilver impregnation stain Insensitive, nonspecificDirect fluorescent antibodyInsensitive, specific Culture Blood Positive during first 10 days Cerebrospinal fluid Positive during first 10 days Urine Positive after first week Serology Indirect hemagglutination Insensitive, nonspecificSlide agglutination Insensitive, nonspecificELISA Diagnostic tests for Leptospirosis A 28-year-old hair dresser complained of a painless small ulcer on the penis during the last 2 weeks.

How will you demonstrate the causative bacteria in the clinical specimens? What are the virulence factors of the bacteria? What are the antibiotics used for treatment of the condition?CASE STUDY Chap-44.indd 385 5/14/2012 3:33:43 Acholeplasmataceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Anaplasmataceae; of which, most mycoplasma causing human infections belong to the family Mycoplasmataceae. Family Acholeplasmataceae includes mostly saprophytic mycoplasmas; these mycoplasmas do not require sterols as growth factor. Family Spiroplasmataceae includes mostly mycoplasmas, which are parasites of arthropods and plants; they require sterols as their growth factor. Family Anaplasmataceae contains mycoplasmas that are strict anaerobes and are found in the intestinal tract of cattle and sheep. Classification The family Mycoplasmataceae includes parasite mycoplasmas, which require cholesterol or other sterols as growth factors. It consists of two genera\u2014Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. At least 13 species of genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma are known to colonize or cause diseases in humans. The genus Mycoplasma contains the pathogens that use glu- cose or arginine, but do not utilize urea. The genus contains over 90 species. These species occur as commensals, para-sites, and pathogens of a variety of plant insects and mam-malian hosts. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most important species known to cause other pathogens that are commonly associated with human infections. The genus Ureaplasma includes the organisms that utilize urea. Genus Ureaplasma consists of 5 species of which Urea-plasma urealyticum is the most important species isolated from infections of genital and respiratory tract in humans (Table 45-1). Mycoplasmas are prokaryotes, but they differ from prokaryotes by having a unique cell membrane that contains sterols. Also, the mycoplasmas do not have a cell wall. Mycoplasma pathogens when first discovered were thought to be viruses or L form of bacteria.Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma Mycoplasma pneumoniae M. pneumoniae is the most important species causing upper respiratory tract disease. It is also known for causing walking pneumonia or primary atypical pneumonia. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Mycoplasmas show the following morphological features: Mycoplasmas are very small bacteria measuring 150-250 nm in dimension. They do not have a cell wall and typically their cell membranes contain sterols. Many mycoplasma can pass through 0.45 /H9262m filter, hence were once believed to be viruses. However, they differ from viruses in the following properties: They contain both ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribo-nucleic acid (DNA). They are able to grow on cell-free media in vitro. They show both intracellular and extracellular parasitism in vivo. Mycoplasma species was also considered to be L form of bac- teria because they lack a cell wall. However, they differ from bacteria including L forms in the following properties: They have sterols in the cell membrane. They do not show any reversion to structure with cell walls.Bacteria Diseases Mycoplasma pneumoniae Upper respiratory tract diseases, lower respiratory tract infections, and primary atypical pneumonia Mycoplasma hominis Pelvic inflammatory disease and postpartum fever Mycoplasma fermentans Opportunistic infections in patients with HIV Mycoplasma pirum Septicemia in patients with HIV Mycoplasma salivarium Infection 45MYCOPLASMA UREAPLASMA 387 They do not share any DNA homology with other bacteria. They have genome with a low molecular weight. They have low guanine and cytosine contents. The absence of cell wall makes Mycoplasma resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, and other anti-biotics that interfere with the synthesis of the cell wall. Mycoplasma species typically show pleomorphism and occur as granular and filaments of various sizes. The filaments are slender of varying length and show true branching. They multiply by binary fission. However, genomic repli-cation and cell division are often asynchronous, resulting in production of multinucleate fragments and other body forms and chains of beads. They do not possess flagella or pili, but some Mycoplasma species including M. pneumoniae show gliding motility on liquid-covered surfaces. Mycoplasma organisms stain poorly by Gram stain and are Gram negative. They are better stained by Giemsa and Diene stain. Culture Mycoplasmas are aerobic and facultative anaerobes. M. pneu-moniae is an exception, which is a strict aerobe. They grow at 37\u00b0C and at pH range of 7.3-7.8. 1. PPLO broth: Pleuropneumonia-lik e organism (PPLO) broth is a medium widely used for isolation of myco-plasma. This medium is supplemented with 20% horse serum, 10% yeast extract, and glucose. Phenol red is used as a pH indicator. The high concentration of animal serum (horse serum) is used as a source of exogenous sterols (cholesterol and other lipids). Addition of agar makes the medium solid. The medium is supplemented with penicil-lin, ampicillin, and polymyxin B to inhibit growth of con-taminating bacteria, and amphotericin B is used to inhibit contamination with fungi. 2. PPLO agar: The PPLO bro th is solidified by addition of agar. The mycoplasmas are typically slow growers with a generation time of 1-6 hours. Mycoplasmas on PPLO agar produce small colonies, typically described as a fried-egg appearance, which consists of a central, opaque, granular area of growth surrounded by a flat, trans-lucent, peripheral area. Initially, the mycoplasmas multiply within the agar to produce opaque, ball-shaped colonies that grow up to the surface of the agar and then spread around it, forming a translucent peripheral zone. Colonies may be seen with a hand lens, which is best studied after staining by Diene's method. By this staining, the fried-egg appearance colonies of myco- plasma appear highly granular, with the center of the colonies stained dark blue and the periphery of the colonies staining light blue. The agar in the medium appears clear or a slightly violet. Mycoplasma other than M. pneumoniae becomes colorless after a period of time, because it reduces the methylene blue. M. pneumoniae unlike other Mycoplasma species are very slow- growing bacteria. They require 1-4 weeks to produce colonies on agar. M. pneumoniae does not produce fried-egg appearance colonies but instead produces a colony known as mulberry-shaped colonies. These colonies do not show any thin hallow unlike that of fried-egg appearance colonies. Most Mycoplasma colonies produce a zone of hemolysis on blood agar. Mycoplasmas do not have the capability to synthe-size cholesterol and related sterols; hence these are supplied from outside for growth of mycoplasmas. They also lack the ability to synthesize purines and pyrimidines. Biochemical reactions Mycoplasmas show the following biochemical 1. pneumoniae and other species ( M. fermentans, M. genitalia, and M. agalactiae) utilize glucose and other carbohydrates as the major source of energy. 2. M. salivarium and other species ( M. orale, M. hominis, and M. fermentans) utilize arginine as a major source of energy. 3. Mycoplasma are chemo-organotrophs, the metabolism being mainly ferment ative. The liquid culture medium used for fermentation reaction is supplemented with glucose, arginine, and urea, and phenol red as an indicator. Mycoplasma species fermenting carbohydrate utilize glucose to produce lactic acid, resulting in formation of acidic pH. Arginine-utilizing Mycoplasma species produce ammonia, CO 2, and adenosine triphosphate by metabolism of arginine. Ammonia production leads to change of the medium to alkaline. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Myco- plasmas are readily killed by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The bacteria are sensitive to antiseptic solutions, such as cyclo-heximide and cetrimide, which inhibit their growth. They are resistant to UV light and photodynamic action of methylene blue, hence M. pneumoniae can grow in presence of 0.002% of methylene blue in agar, while many other Mycoplasma species are inhibited at this concentration. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Membrane glycolipids and proteins are the major antigenic determinants of the mycoplasmas. Membrane glycolipid anti-gens show cross-reaction with human tissues and other bacte-ria. These antigens are identified by complement fixation tests. Glycolipids with similar antigenic structure have been demon-strated in neurons in human brain. The antibodies against M. pneumoniae glycolipid may cross-react with brain cell, therefore, causing damage to neuronal cells. This cell damage possibly is Chap-45.indd 387 5/14/2012 12:18:24 PMSection III Chapter 45388 BACTERIOLOGY neurological manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection. M. pneumoniae possesses two major surface proteins including the adhesion protein P1, which is responsible for attachment of bacteria to cell structures. These protein anti-gens are identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The P1 protein induces production of antibodies, which not only react with P1 protein but also react with anti-genic determinants of RBCs, leading to lysis of erythrocytes in autoimmune disease process. Pathogenesis and Immunity Mycoplasmas are primarily extracellular pathogens that adhere to surface of ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells. Virulence factors The adhesion protein called P1 is the key virulence factor of the Mycoplasma. The bacteria usually do not cause invasion of the blood to produce systemic manifestation of the disease.P1 antigen: P1 antigen is a membrane-associated protein, which helps in adhesion of mycoplasmas to epithelial cells. This protein or adhesin combines specifically with sialated gly-coprotein receptors present at the base of the cilia on epithelial surface. This same receptor is also present on the surface of the erythrocytes. The antibodies against P1 antigen can also act as an autoantibody against RBCs causing their agglutination. Pathogenesis of Mycoplasma infections Following attachment, Mycoplasma cause direct damage to the epithelial cells in which first cilia and then ciliated epithelial cells are destroyed. Loss of the cells interferes with normal functioning of the upper respiratory tract. This results in the lower respiratory tract to become infected with microbes and mechanically irritated. The mechanical irritation causes persis-tent cough typically seen in patients with respiratory infection caused by M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae behaves as a super antigen. This causes migra- tion of inflammatory cells to the site of infection and produces cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. These cytokines help in clearing of the bacte-ria and of the disease. The bacteria usually do not cause invasion of the blood to produce systemic manifestation of the disease. Mycoplasma rarely penetrates the submucosa except in rare cases of immunosuppression or following instrumentation. In these conditions, they may invade the blood stream and cause infection in different organs of the body. Host immunity M. pneumoniae infection does not induce any protective immu-nity. Individuals suffering from M. pneumoniae infection are susceptible to reinfection by the bacteria. The P1 antigen induces production of antibodies. These antibodies are found in nearly 50% of patients infected with M. pneumoniae. The anti-body against P1 antigen is an autoantibody that cross-reacts with antigen I of RBCs and is not protective.Clinical Syndromes M. pneumoniae primarily causes respiratory infections in humans. Respiratory infections Majority of the respiratory infections are mild and self- limiting. M. pneumoniae causes (a) upper respiratory tract infections, (b) lower respiratory tract infections, and (c) primary atypical pneumonia.Upper respiratory tract infections: M. pneumoniae typically causes mild upper respiratory tract infections. The condition is characterized by low-grade fever, malaise, and headache. Nonproductive cough is a typical manifestation, which appears 2-3 weeks after exposure. The cough is initially nonproductive but may later produce small to moderated quantities of spu-tum, which may become mucopurulent and even blood tinged in more severe cases.Lower respiratory tract infections: These include tra-cheobronchitis and bronchopneumonia. The condition is characterized by primary infection of bronchi with infil-tration of bronchial epithelial cells by lymphocytes and plasma cells.Primary atypical pneumonia: The condition is also known as walking pneumonia. Incubation period varies from 2 to 3 weeks. Patients suffering from atypical pneumonia usually do not appear ill. Hence, the illness is often referred to as walking pneumonia. The pharynx is affected, becomes edematous but without any cervical adenopathy. The condition is associated with presence of patchy bronchopneumonia seen on the chest X ray. Disparity between physical findings and radiological evidence of chest is the hallmark of infection. The infection is usually self-limiting. In 5-20% of patients, pleural effusion may occur. Extrapulmonary infections Extrapulmonary manifestations are not rare. Cardiac abnormal-ities, such as myocarditis and pericarditis are the most frequently reported extrapulmonary manifestations. Other manifestations include neurological abnormalities, otitis media, and erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). M. pneumoniae infec- tions tend to cause much more severe disease in: children suffering from immunosuppressive disease; individuals with sickle cell anemia, functional asplenia and children with Down syndrome. Subclinical infection may occur in 20% of adults (Fig. 45-1). Epidemiology Geographical distribution M. pneumoniae infection is distributed worldwide. The organ-ism is responsible for up to 20% of community-acquired pneu-monia, which requires hospitalization. M. pneumoniae infection occurs both in epidemic and in endemic forms. The condition Chap-45.indd 388 5/14/2012 12:18:24 PMSection III Chapter 45MYCOPLASMA AND UREAPLASMA 389 is widely documented in the European countries and in the United States. The exact information on M. pneumoniae infec- tion is not available from the developing countries. However, the results of few seroprevalence studies indicate that the con-dition may be endemic in many of the developing countries. Habitat M. pneumoniae is a strict human pathogen. The bacteria inhabit the upper respiratory tract in an infected host. They are usu-ally present in the mucosa, residing extracellularly on the upper respiratory tract. Reservoir, host, and transmission of infection Humans are the usual host of M. pneumoniae and thus signifi-cant reservoir of infection. Patients with active infection are more likely to transmit M. pneumoniae infection. M. pneumoniae is most commonly transmitted by close contact through nasal secretions. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of aero-solized droplets. Person-to-person transmission usually occurs among college students and military recruits who live together in close proximity. M. pneumoniae is usually associated with pneumonia, and highest rate of infection is found in children between 9 and 10 years, and also in young adults. Infection is common among school-going children. In recent years, the infection is also being increasingly docu- mented in people older than 65 years. In this old population, M. pneumoniae is responsible for causing nearly 15% of commu-nity-acquired pneumonia and is second pathogen next only to Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia. Key Points M. pneumoniae infection is uncommon in infants. Individuals with sickle cell disease and immunosuppres-sion are at increased risk for systemic infection caused by M. pneumoniae and may develop pleural effusion and pro-found respiratory distress.Laboratory Diagnosis Initial treatment of M. pneumoniae infection is based on clinical diagnosis of the condition. The definite diagnosis of the condi-tion usually takes 3-4 weeks. Hence, treatment is started with-out waiting for the result of laboratory tests. Specimens Respiratory specimens include throat washings, bronchial washings, and expectorated sputum. Tracheal washings are more useful than sputum specimens, because most patients with respiratory tract infections do not produce any sputum as they have a dry and nonproductive cough. The specimens are collected and transported to the laboratory immediately. If delay is anticipated, they are usually inoculated in suitable transport media, such as SP4 transport medium to prevent desiccation. The specimens can be stored at /H1100270\u00b0C if these cannot be sent immediately to the laboratory after collection. Microscopy Microscopy is of no value in diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infec- tions. Mycoplasmas are stained poorly, because they lack cell wall. Direct antigen detection Antigen capture immunoassay has been used for direct detec-tion of M. pneumoniae in sputum specimen with high sensitivity and specificity. Direct immunofluorescence, counter-current immunoelectrophoresis, and immunoblotting with monoclo-nal antibodies are the tests used for detection of antigen in clinical specimens. Culture Bacterial culture is of little practical value because of its fastidious growth requirements and need for 3-4 weeks for culture. Isolation of M. pneumoniae from clinical specimens by culture confirms the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae respiratory ill-ness. The specimens are inoculated into mycoplasma medium, as PPLO agar supplemented with serum (source for ste-rols), glucose, pH indicator, yeast extract (source for nucleic acid precursor), and antibiotics and antifungal agents (to inhibit bacteria and fungi). On this medium, M. pneumoniae grows very slowly and colonies are demonstrated at 37\u00b0C. The growth is facilitated by incubation in the presence of 95% N 2 and 5% of CO2. The bacteria produce small colonies with homogenous appearance, typically described as mulberry-shape colonies. Identification of bacteria The identifying features of M. pneumoniae colonies are summa-rized in Box 45-1. They are identified by the following tests.Color change: The colonies are identified by noting a color change from red to yellow of phenol red due to fermentation of glucose resulting in the production of acid, which makes pH of the media acidic.U. urealyticum UrethritisU. urealyticum Endometritis 45-1. Infections Mycoplasma and method, the Diene stain (diluted 1:10 with distilled water) is added directly to the plate containing sus-pected colonies of Mycoplasma. The plate is then immediately rinsed with distilled water to remove the stain. This is followed by decolorizing the medium by adding 1 mL of 95% ethanol and keeping it for 1 minute. The plate is rewashed with dis-tilled water and is allowed to dry. After drying, the colonies are observed under low power of the microscope. By Diene staining, the fried-egg appearance colonies of Mycoplasma appear highly granular, with the center of the colonies stained dark blue and the periphery of the colonies staining light blue. The agar in the medium appears clear or slightly violet. Mycoplasma other than M. pneumoniae becomes colourless after a period of time because it reduces the methy-lene blue. The colonies identified are confirmed by inhibition of their growth with specific M. pneumoniae antisera.Hemadsorption test: The test is performed by flooding M. pneumoniae colonies grown on surface of agar with 2 mL of 0.2-0.4% suspension of guinea pig erythrocytes in Mycoplasma growth medium. The plate is incubated at 35\u00b0C for 35 minutes followed by washing with 3 mL of Mycoplasma growth medium by gently rotating the plate. The washing fluid is gently removed by aspiration with a pipette. M. pneumoniae colonies adsorb guinea pig erythrocytes, which is facilitated at 37\u00b0C. M. pneumoniae colonies adsorbing erythrocytes on their surface are demonstrated under the microscope. The colonies are observed under 40/H11003 magnification.Tetrazolium reduction test: The test is based on the principle that M. pneumoniae has the ability to reduce triphenyl tetra- zolium, a colorless compound, to formazan, a red-colored compound. This test is performed by flooding the colonies of M. pneumoniae on agar with a solution of 2-p-iodophenyl- 3-nitrophenyl-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride and incubating it at 35\u00b0C for an hour. In a positive test, M. pneumoniae colonies appear reddish after 1 hour and may appear purple to black after 3-4 hours of incubation. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis is based on demonstration of specific antibodies in serum using Mycoplasma antigens. M. pneumoniae glycolipid antigen extracted by chloroform and methanol is also widely used for serodiagnosis of atypical pneumonia. Complement fixation test and ELISA are the tests frequently used.Complement fixation test: A fourfold rise in complement- fixing antibody titer or a single titer of 1:64 or more is sug-gestive of recent infection. The complement-fixing antibodies appear after 7-10 days of infection and reach the peak after 4-6 weeks of infection. The complement-fixing antibodies are demonstrated in approximately 80% of the cases.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: IgM ELISA is most frequently used test. IgM ELISA is used to detect specific IgM antibodies in a single serum specimen. This test has a specific-ity of 99% and sensitivity of 97%. Recently, a quantitative, rapid, single-specimen, membrane-based ELISA has been evaluated as a rapid diagnostic method for demonstration of either IgM or IgG antibodies. The results for this test can be obtained within 30 minutes of performing the test.Nonspecific serological tests: These tests are called nonspecific because they do not use specific Mycoplasma antigen; instead they use cross-reacting and nonspecific anti-gens. These tests include Streptococcus MG agglutination test and cold agglutination test. Streptococcus MG agglutination test: In this test, a heat-killed suspension of Streptococcus MG is used as antigen. The antigen is mixed with serial dilution of patient's unheated serum. The agglutination is observed after overnight incu-bation at 37\u00b0C. An antibody titer of 1:20 or more is sugges-tive of M. pneumoniae infection. Cold agglutination test : In this test, human O group eryth- rocytes are used as antigen. This is based on the principle that autoantibodies that agglutinate human O group cells at low temperatures appear in most of the cases of atypical pneumonia. The test is performed by collecting patient's blood, which should never be refrigerated before separa-tion of serum because agglutinins are readily absorbed by homologous RBCs at low temperatures. The patient's serum is mixed with equal volume of 0.2% washed suspension of human O erythrocytes. The suspension is incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight and observed for clumping. The clumping is dis-associated at 37\u00b0C. The titer of 1:32 or more is suggestive of M. pneumoniae infection. The cold agglutinins usually appear in more than 50% of the cases by the second week of inf ection and reach a peak at 4-5 weeks. The antibody titer thereafter declines rapidly, and test becomes negative in about 5 month. A fourfold rise in cold agglutinin titer of the paired serum and convalescent sera, or single titer of 1:32 is suggestive of M. pneumoniae infection. The noted dis-advantage of this test is that this is a nonspecific test, because the cold agglutinins are also demonstrated in sera of other diseases, such hemolytic anemia. 1. Very small bacteria; poorly stained with Gram stain but stain well with Diene stain. 2. A color change from red to y ellow of phenol red. 3. Colonies stained directly by applying Diene stain. 4. Colonies positive for hemadsorption test. 5. Colonies positive for tetrazolium reduction test. 6. The colonies identified are confirmed by inhibition of their growth with specif ic M. pneumoniae antisera. 7. On agar, mycoplasmas produce having a \"fried egg\" appearance with an opaq ue central zone of gro wth within the agar and a translucent peripheral zone on the surface.Box 45-1 Identifying features of Mycoplasma Recently, a seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using 60S ribosomal DNA has been developed for demonstration of P1 adhesin in protein for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. These tests are of high sensitivity and specificity. They have added advantage of detecting M. pneumoniae infections at an early stage. Disadvantage of the test is that it is expensive and is available only in few laboratories. Treatment Therapy with antibiotics is usually not necessary for treat-ment of upper respiratory tract infection caused by M. pneu-moniae. However, treatment with antibiotics may be helpful for management of Mycoplasma pneumonia, because it reduces duration of illness and also reduces the number of Mycoplasma in clinical specimen. It also reduces the symptoms, enhances resolution of pneumonia, and facilitates recovery from the disease. Pneumonia is usually a self-limiting disease and is not life-threatening in most patients. M. pneumoniae remains susceptible to tetracyclines and eryth- romycin, because these antibiotics act on the mycoplasmas by inhibiting synthesis of protein. Tetracycline has the additional advantage of also being active against most other mycoplas-mas and chlamydiae, the common causes of nongonococcal urethritis. Mycoplasma organisms are resistant to penicillins and cepha- losporins, because these antibiotics act on the cell wall, which is lacking in mycoplasmas. Prevention and Control Isolation of the patients infected with M. pneumoniae is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease. Antibiotic prophylaxis with tetracyclines or erythromycin is also useful. No vaccine is available against Mycoplasma infections. Genital Mycoplasma Species M. hominis and Mycoplasma genitalis are the genital Mycoplasma species, which inhabit the mucosa of the urogenital tract. Mycoplasma hominis M. hominis facultative anaerobe is relatively a fast-grow-ing Mycoplasma, which grows within 1-4 days. The bacteria meta- bolize arginine but do not utilize glucose. M. hominis typically produces large fried-egg appearance colonies on Mycoplasma medium. Inhibition of the growth of the bacteria with specific antisera to M. hominis is used to differentiate it from other geni-tal mycoplasmas. The clinical manifestations by genital myco-plasmas vary depending on the type of infection: M. hominis is associated with infection of genitourinary tract and reproductive disease. M. hominis causes genital infection, which may result in diverse manifestation, such as salpingi-tis, pelvic abscess, puerperal infection, septic abortion. It also causes nongenital infections, such as septic arthritis, peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis, and brain abscess. It may also cause primary atypical pneumonia and meningi-tis in newborns. The incidence of colonization by genital mycoplasmas increases after puberty and is related to the sexual activity. M. hominis col- onizes in approximately 15% of sexually active men and women, while Ureaplasma colonizes 45-70% of sexually active women. M. hominis organisms unlike other mycoplasmas are resistant to erythromycin and occasionally to tetracyclines. Clindamycin is use-ful to treat infections caused by such resistant strains of M. hominis. Mycoplasma genitalis M. genitalis has also been implicated as a cause of nongonococ-cal urethritis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). M. genitalis is primarily a pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause occasional infection in the genitourinary and respiratory tract. It is a very difficult organism to be isolated by culture. Their isolation may require more than 2-4 months of incubation. These genital Mycoplasma species have been isolated more fre- quently from African American than from white men and women. Colonization of infants by Mycoplasma species usually occurs dur- ing passage of the baby through the birth canal. Colonization with these genital mycoplasmas occurs only up to 2 years. Since genital mycoplasmas have been transmitted sexually, avoidance of sexual activity or the use of proper safety proce-dures prevents the disease caused by these genital mycoplasmas. Ureaplasma urealyticum U. urealyticum is a genital pathogen, which is associated with the urogenital tract of humans and animals. It is one of the most important causes of nongonococcal urethritis. The bac-teria require supplementation with urea for their growth. Mycoplasma medium supplemented with urea, which is highly buffered to prevent alkalinity of the medium, is useful for growth of U. urealyticum. U. urealyticum typically hydrolyzes urea as essential growth factor for the bacterium. The bacteria like those of mycoplasmas produce very minute colonies measuring 15-50 /H9262m in size. Hence, they were earlier called T strain or T strain Mycoplasma. This human T strain Mycoplasma is now redesignated as U. urealyticum. U. urealyticum is sexually and causes chorioamnionitis, prematurity, vaginitis, cervicitis, acute sal-pingitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Ureaplasma organisms are most frequently isolated from infants, particu-larly girls. The bacteria also cause urethritis, proctitis, pneumonia is a term used to distinguish from typi-cal pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Earlier any patient with sudden onset of fever, chills, pleuritic pain, and expectoration of blood-tinged sputum was believed to present with typical pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae. The patients not showing these characteristic manifestations were referred to as having atypical pneumonia. M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are three important agents responsible for atypical pneumonia. In this condition, these pathogens are usually not isolated from sputum by rou-tine culture methods. Beta-lactam antibiotics are usually ineffective against Mycoplasma because of the absence of cell wall, and these anti-biotics usually act by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall. Penicillin and cephalosporins are ineffective against all these pathogens because they do not show intracellular penetration in these pathogens. A 3-year-old boy attended the Medicine OPD with symptoms of sudden onset of fever, chills, pleuritic pain, and expectora-tion of blood-tinged sputum. Routine bacteriological culture was negative. Serum for cold agglutination test was positive. Diagnose the disease. What are the other laboratory tests used for the diagnosis of the condition? List other pathogens causing the disease. What are other genital mycoplasmas known to cause human infections?CASE STUDY Chap-45.indd bacilli. They are considered to be transitional forms between bacteria and fungi. Like bacteria they possess cell wall, contain-ing muramic acid. They also possess prokaryotic nuclei and are susceptible to antibiotics. But like fungi, they form delicate filaments called hyphae similar to the hyphal form in fungi. These hyphal forms are seen in bacteria isolated by culture and are also seen in clinical specimens. The actinomycetes include a wide range of bacteria, which are found in soil and putrefied vegetables. They are also found in humans and animals. The actinomycetes include anaero-bic or facultative anaerobic bacteria belonging to the genus Actinomyces. Furthermore, depending on the presence or absence of mycolic acids in the cell wall, aerobic actinomycetes can be broadly classified into two groups as follows: 1. Actinomycetes with mycolic acids: This Mycobac- teriaceae, Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, and Gordonia. Members of all these genera stain poorly with Gram stain and are partially acid fast. 2. Actinomycetes without mycolic acid: This group includes man by actinomycetes are summarized in Table 46-1.Actinomyces Actinomyces israeli is the most common Actinomyces causing human measure 0.5-1 /H9262m in diameter. They often grow in filaments that separate into bacillary and coccoid filaments. Culture Actinomyces organisms are facultative anaerobes. They grow better under anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions at an optimum temperature of 35-37\u00b0C. Presence of 5-10% CO 2 facilitates the growth. Actinomyces species grow slowly; they need a longer incubation period of 3-4 days. A. israeli may require even 7-14 days for growth.1. Brain heart infusion agar: Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar or heart infusion agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated rabbit, sheep, or horse blood is the enriched medium used frequently for Actinomyces. On these media, in anaerobic to Actinomycetes species Cervicofacial species Primary cutaneous nocardiosis, bronchopulmonary infection, and secondary central nervous system infection Rhodococcus species Pulmonary infections and opportunistic infections (traumatic endophthalmitis, peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis, and post-traumatic skin infection) Gordonia species Opportunistic infections Tsukamurella species III Chapter 46394 BACTERIOLOGY the form colonies with a characteristic molar-tooth appearance.2. Liquid media: Heart infusion blood and thioglycollate blood supplemented with 0.1-0.2% sterile rabbit serum are the examples of liquid media used for culture of Actinomyces species. Pathogenesis and Immunity Actinomyces species are present as normal flora of the oral cavity and also in the lower gastrointestinal tract and female genital tract of human hosts. Key Points The actinomyces by themselves are not virulent, but they require the presence of devitalized or dead tissue and a break in the continuity of the mucosal membranes to facili-tate their invasion into deeper tissues and cause infection. Establishment of human infection by Actinomyces always requires the presence of companion bacteria. These companion bacteria help in initiation of infection by producing a toxin or enzyme or by inhibiting host immunity. These companion bacteria are believed to act as copatho-gens that enhance the virulence of Actinomyces. is established by Actinomyces , the immune system of the infected human host stimulates an intense inflammatory response in the form of a suppurative granulo-matous and fibrotic reaction. Infection by Actinomyces typically spreads contiguously and invades surrounding tissues and organs. Finally, the infection results in the production of drain-ing sinus tracts, which contain lot of damaged tissue. Bacteria from this site may disseminate through blood circulation to distant organs. Clinical Syndromes Actinomyces causes actinomycosis. Actinomycosis Actinomycosis is a subacute and chronic bacterial infection characterized by contiguous spread and suppurative and gran-ulomatous inflammation. The condition is associated with the formation of multiple abscesses and development of sinus tracts discharging white to yellowish granules, known as sul-phur granules. Actinomycosis manifest as thoracic the abdomen pelvis.Cervicofacial actinomycosis: It is the most common mani- festation in humans comprising about two-thirds of reported cases. The infection occurs in the cervicofacial region, which typically occurs following oral surgery in patients with poor oral hygiene. Initially, the condition manifests as a swelling of the soft tissue of the perimandibular area and subsequently, during the course of the infection, the disease spreads directly into the adjacent tissues and leads to formation of fistulas. These fistulas or sinus tracts discharge purulent material containing yellow granules, known as sulfur granules. If left untreated, this condition may spread to the blood and eventu-ally to the brain and to the orbit.Thoracic actinomycosis: This condition is responsible for 15-20% of cases of actinomycosis. It is caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions containing Actinomyces and occasion-ally during perforation of the esophagus. The condition also occurs by direct spread from an actinomycotic lesion of the nape of the neck or the abdomen, or through blood circulation from other distant sites. The condition commonly presents as a pulmonary infiltrate or mass involving the lung. The condi-tion, if left untreated, can spread outwardly through the pleura, pericardium, and chest wall, ultimately leading to the forma-tion of multiple sinuses that discharge sulfur granules.Actinomycosis of the abdomen and pelvis: This condition accounts nearly 10-20% of reported cases. The ileocecal region is the most common site involved in the condition. The condi-tion typically presents as a slowly growing tumor. The infection subsequently spreads and involves abdominal organs includ-ing the abdominal wall, leading to the formation of draining sinuses. Actinomycosis of pelvis is commonly associated with prolonged (for many years) use of intrauterine contraceptive devices. The infection spreads directly from uterus to pelvis. Epidemiology Actinomycosis is distributed worldwide. The condition is more common in rural areas and in farm workers. The condition is seen more commonly in individuals with poor dental hygiene and in the people with low socioeconomic conditions. Men are affected more commonly than women (male to female ratio is 4:3) with the exception of pelvic actinomycosis. Majority of the cases are reported in young and middle-aged patients. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis is made by direct detection of Actinomyces in specimens by microscopy and by isolation of organism by culture. Specimens The specimens include sputum, bronchial secretions and dis-charges, and infected tissues. All these specimens may con-tain large number of sulfur granules. The sulfur granules are also present on the dressings removed from a draining sinus tract. It is essential to transport these specimens immediately to the laboratory for processing, preferably under anaerobic conditions. Microscopy Sulfur granules are white to yellow and vary in size from minute specs to large granules. These granules are separated from pus and Chap-46.indd 394 5/14/2012 12:17:57 PMSection III Chapter 46ACTINOMYCETES 395 other specimens and are collected directly from draining sinuses. These are crushed between two slides and are stained by Gram or Ziehl-Neelsen staining method, using 1% sulfuric acid for decol-orization. The stained smears on microscopic examination show Gram-positive hyphal fragments surrounded by peripheral zone of swollen, radiating, club-shaped structures presenting a sun-ray appearance. These club-shaped structures are Gram positive, acid fast, and are believed to be antigen complexes. Culture Sulfur granules or pus-containing Actinomyces are immediately cultured under anaerobic conditions at 35-37\u00b0C for up to 14 days. The specimens are inoculated on blood agar, BHI agar, and into thioglycollate broth incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C. A. israeli produces large (0-5 mm in diameter), white, smooth, entire or lobulated colonies resembling molar tooth after 10 days of anaerobic incubation. Identification of bacteria Actinomycetes colonies are identified by microscopy, biochem-ical reactions, direct fluorescent antibody test, and gel immu-nodiffusion test (Box 46-1). The latter two tests are very useful to differentiate A. israeli from other actinomycotic species and filamentous anaerobes that produce similar type of granules in the tissues. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probes and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have been evaluated and used with high sensitivity and specificity for accurate identification of Actinomyces species in clinical specimens. Treatment High-dose penicillins or tetracyclines given over a pro-longed period are the mainstay of therapy for actinomycosis. Metronidazole, and and cloxacillin do not have activity against Actinomyces species. Surgical therapy is included for more extensive and compli-cated cases of actinomycosis.Prevention and Control Good dental hygiene and oral hygiene are important in preven-tion of the disease. Nocardia Nocardia are aerobic actinomycetes that are ubiquitous in the soil, decaying organic matter, and water. Classification The genus Nocardia has been classified into 10 species on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA. These species can be differ-entiated on the species frequently associated with human infections. Nocardia species also cause infection in animals, including bovine mastitis in cattle and nocardiosis in horses. History Nocardia infection was first described by French veterinarian Edmund Nocard in a pulmonary and cutaneous disease of cattle. The genus Nocardia is named so in honor of the scientist. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology Nocardia show the following features: Nocardia are Gram-positive bacilli showing a branching, beaded, and filamentous form. They stain poorly with Gram stain and appear to be Gram negative with intracellular Gram-positive granules. Nocardia organisms like that of mycobacteria contain mycolic acid in their cell wall. They are usually weakly acid fast. Acid fastness is a property of Nocardia by which it can be differ-entiated from other similar bacteria, such as actinomycetes. Culture Nocardia are strictly aerobic bacteria. They readily grow on com-monly used routine media, such as nutrient agar, Sabouraud's BHI extract agar. Presence of 5-10% of CO 2 facilitates the growth of the bacteria. Nocardia are slow-growing bacteria and, therefore, need prolonged incubation of 7 days or more for their culture and isolation in the media. Nocardia on these media produces colonies varying from dry to waxy and white to orange in color. Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar is a selective medium used for isolation of Nocardia from the specimens potentially contaminated with other bacteria. Biochemical reactions Nocardia are catalase positive and they use sugars oxida-tively. They produce acid from glucose and they utilize urea. 1. Gram-positive bacilli. 2. Nonmotile, nonsporing, and non-acid-fast bacilli. 3. Produce molar-tooth shaped colonies. 4. Species identification is made by direct fluorescent antibody test and gel immunodiffusion test. 5. Facultative anaerobes grow best under anaerobic or micro-aero-philic conditions with the addition of 5-10% CO 2.Box 46-1 features of are summa-rized in Table 46-2. Pathogenesis and Immunity Nocardia species are opportunistic pathogens. Nocardia causes suppurative necrosis with the formation of abscesses at the site of infection. These species cause following infections: Cutaneous nocardiosis arises from the local trauma into the surface of the skin, which facilitates entry of the organ-ism into subcutaneous tissues. Pleuropulmonary disease occurs most commonly due to inhalation of infectious aerosols. This condi-tion is most commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, including the patients with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndome) and the patients receiv-ing immunosuppressive therapy. The condition is also common in patients with chronic pulmonary disease such as emphysema, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, etc. The infection begins after colonization of the oropharynx by inhalation of infective aerosols. This is followed by aspira-tion of pleural secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Disseminated infection is usually secondary to pleuropul-monary infection that has occurred earlier in the lungs. The disseminated infection occurs most commonly in individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy or with underlying immunocompromised diseases. The patients who have received organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplantation and patients with cirrhosis, lymphoretic-ular malignancies, and SLE (systemic lupus erythemato-sus) are more susceptible to infection. N. asteroides is the most important species causing approxi-mately 90% of human infections. Clinical Syndromes Clinical manifestations of disease caused by Nocardia depend on the site of infection. Nocardia causes following infections: Primary cutaneous nocardiosis Primary cutaneous infection and lymphocutaneous infection. Cutaneous infec-tion may occur through wound contamination or by trauma. Usually feet and hands are involved.Cutaneous infection: Actinomycotic mycetoma is the impor-tant lesion of cutaneous infection. Cutaneous infection may occur through wound contamination or by trauma. Usually feet and hands are involved. This condition is a painless chronic infection of the skin, characterized by subcutaneous swelling, suppuration, and presence of multiple sinuses. This is an invasive and destructive infection in which underlying bone and connective tissues are destroyed. As the infection progresses, multiple sinuses open to the surface of the skin with exudation or pus. The pus typically contains sulfur granules, which consist of filamentous Nocardia bound together by cal-cium phosphate.Lymphocutaneous infection: The condition is characterized by the presence of cutaneous nodules and ulcers associated with lymphadenopathy. The lymphadenopathy also may occasionally drain purulent pus. Bronchopulmonary infection Bronchopulmonary infection is one of the important clinical manifestations in most patients with nocardiosis. Presence of inflammatory endobronchial masses, localized or generalized abscesses are the manifestations of the condition. The condition is associated with formation of cavities, abscesses in the lungs, and pleural effusion. Cough with production of sputum and fever are the common symptoms. Clinically, this condition can-not be distinguished from infections of other microbial etiology. Secondary CNS infection The condition manifests as chronic meningitis or as manifesta-tion of single or multiple abscesses in the brain. CNS nocardiosis presents as slow, progressing mass lesion and is found in 20-40% of disseminated nocardial infection. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Nocardial infections are reported worldwide, but no reliable estimates are available. Habitat Nocardia are distributed in the soil rich in organic matter. They are present as transient pathogens in humans. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Nocardia spp. that colonize the normal humans usually do not cause any infection in the same host. Nocardia organisms are exogenous pathogens. The infection is acquired by inhalation of infective aerosols or by penetration through Chapter 46ACTINOMYCETES 397 Pulmonary and disseminated nocardiosis are increasingly found in the immunocompromised individuals. The infections are much more common in patients with HIV or patients who have received organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplantation and in patients with cirrhosis, lymphoreticular malignancies, and SLE. The condi-tion is also more common in patients with chronic pulmonary dis-ease, such as emphysema, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, etc. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of nocardiosis depends on the demon-stration of Nocardia by microscopy and isolation by culture. Specimens Nature of the clinical specimens depends on clinical presen-tation of nocardiosis. Sputum is a frequently used specimen. Other specimens include respiratory secretions, skin biopsies, or pus from the abscesses. Microscopy Diagnosis is made by demonstration of branching actinomy-cotic filaments in pus or in multiple sputum specimens by microscopy. Smears from the specimen are stained by Gram or Ziehl-Neelsen method. Key Points The granules collected from the cases of mycetoma are very useful for diagnosis: The granules of N. brasiliensis, N. asteroides, N. caviae are soft, white, and measure 0.5-1 mm in size. The granules crushed between two slides are stained with Gram staining and are examined for demonstration of Gram-positive thin filaments. The granules are first collected from pus specimens with an inoculating needle and then washed with saline. These granules are then stained with Giemsa or Ziehl-Neelsen method for presence of typical filamentous hyphae (Fig. 46-1, Color Photo 51). Culture Pus, sputum, and granules are cultured on nutrient agar, Sabouraud's agar and are incubated at 36\u00b0C for up to 3 weeks. Colonies on these media may appear as early as 7 days. Identification of bacteria The colonies are identified on the basis of Gram-positive and weekly acid-fast positive filamentous bacilli and with other biochemical properties. All the species of the genus Nocardia ( N. asteroides com- plex, N. brasiliensis, and N. asteroides complex including N. asteroides, N. farcinica, and N. nova) are identified by using a battery of biochemical tests (Table 46-2). Treatment Sulfonamides are the drug of choice for the treatment of nocardiosis. Sulfadiazine is useful for treatment of CNS infections. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are consid-ered better than sulfadiazine. Nocardia are susceptible carbapenems, as imipenem and cilastatin, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and amikacin. Prevention and Control Prophylactic antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be of some value in prevention of the disease. Rhodococcus The genus Rhodococcus organisms are Gram-positive and strict aerobic actinomycetes. The cell wall of Rhodococcus organisms is similar to those of mycobacterium by containing mycolic acid and tuberculostearic acid, which makes the bacteria acid fast. The genus contains 20 species out of which at least seven species are known to cause disease in humans. Rhodococcus equi, formerly known as Corynebacterium equi, is the most human pathogen. R. equi is a pleomor-phic Gram-positive coccobacillus showing some degrees of branching. It is weakly acid fast. Rhodococcus grows well on routinely used media aerobically. On blood agar, on pro-longed incubation at room temperature, the bacteria produce colonies resembling those of Klebsiella, with production of pink pigments. The bacteria do not ferment carbohydrates and show a variable biochemical reaction. R. equi is an intra-cellular pathogen, which multiplies in macrophages. This causes granulomatous reaction, resulting in the formation of abscess. The bacteria cause invasive pulmonary disease, such as pneumonic and lung abscess. Subsequently, the infection may spread to distant sites of the body causing meningitis, pericarditis, etc. FIG. 46-1. Granules stained with Ziehl-Neelsen opportunis- tic infections, such as traumatic endophthalmitis, peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis, and post-traumatic skin infection. The diagnosis of the condition is made by demon-stration of weakly acid-fast and Gram-positive pleomorphic bacilli in clinical specimens. Definitive diagnosis by culture is often difficult. Rhodococci are difficult bacteria to treat, par-ticularly in immunocompromised patients. They are resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Treatment with vancomy-cin or combination of effective. Gordonia and Tsukamurella Genera Gordonia and Tsukamurella are usually present in soil. They were earlier classified with Rhodococcus, because of their morphological similarities to it. These bacteria contain mycolic acid in their cell wall and are acid fast. Genus Gordonia organisms are rare opportunistic pathogens, which cause infec-tion in humans. They have been associated with pulmonary and cutaneous infections. Tsukamurella has been associated with catheter infections. Thermophilic Actinomyces They are a group of bacteria that are commonly found in decaying vegetations. Thermoactinomyces, Saccharopolyspora, and Saccharomonospora are some important genera been associated with occasional human infections.Tropheryma whippelii Tropheryma whippelii is an actinomycete known to cause Whipple's disease. The bacterium is yet to be cultured. It is usually identified by molecular techniques. Whipple's disease manifests as abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, lymphadenopa-thy, pigmentation of the skin, and arthralgia. The condition is diagnosed by demonstration of the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive inclusion bodies found inside macrophages of the lamina propria of the small intestine. Detection of bacte-rial genome by PCR in intestinal tissue confirms the diagnosis. Dermatophilus Dermatophilus is an actinomycete that causes an exudative derma-titis affecting skin of the hands and feet. The condition is com-monly seen in individuals who are in close contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. These pathogens are susceptible to commonly used antibiotics, such as penicillins and aminoglycosides. Dermatophilus is commonly found in the soil. Oerskovia Oerskovia is an actinomycete that causes opportunistic infection in humans. The bacterium is associated with cervicofacial infec-tions, catheter-associated bacteremia, traumatic endophthalmitis, CNS shunt infections, and infection in patients undergoing long-term peritoneal dialysis. They are usually resistant to antibiotics. A 55-year-old man attended the dental OPD with a swelling of the soft tissue of the perimandibular area with sinus tracts discharging purulent material. The material containing yellow granules was sent to the microbiology laboratory for iden-tification. Microscopy of smears made from granules showed Gram-positive hyphal fragments surrounded by peripheral zone of swollen, radiating, club-shaped structures presenting a sun-ray appearance.

Important bacteria 0.5 /H9262 m) Gram-positive bacillus with a tendency to occur in chains. Typically, the bacteria show a slow tumbling type of motility by means of peritrichous flagella at 22-25\u00b0C, but are nonmotile at 37\u00b0C. The bacterium is aerobic or microaerophilic. It grows between 35 and 37\u00b0C and in the presence of reduced oxygen tension and 5-10% CO 2. It is nonsporing, noncapsulated, and non- acid fast. L. monocytogenes grows on ordinary medium, but grows better on blood agar and tryptose phosphate agar. The bacteria on blood agar after 24 hours incubation produce smooth, round, translucent, easily emulsifiable, and nonpig-mented colonies. On blood agar, they produce a narrow zone of weak beta hemolysis. Due to this hemolysis, the colonies of L. monocytogenes may be confused with those of group B streptococci. L. monocytogenes differs from group B strepto- cocci by following tests: 1. It is motile, catalase positive, and shows positive CAMP (Christie, Atkins, and Munch-Pe terson) reaction and nega- tive hippurate hydrolysis test. 2. In CAMP reaction, L. monocytogenes produces a block type of hemolysis unlike that of arro w-head hemolysis pro- duced by B ferments sugars like glucose, salicine, and aesculin with production of acid. It is MR (methyl red) and VP (Voges-Proskauer) test positive but oxidase, urease, indole, and H 2S negative. Hemolysin, a protein, is an important virulence factor of L. monocytogenes. This is also known as his-tolysin . Histolysin is an extracellular, oxygen-labile, and choles- terol-sensitive of molecular weight 60,000 shows antigenic cross-reactivity with pneumolysin and streptolysin O.L. monocytogenes of infections in preg- nant women, neonates, adults, and elderly people. The bac-teria in nonpregnant ladies may cause asymptomatic or mild febrile illness. However, infection in pregnant ladies may cause abortion or stillbirth of the child. In nonpregnant females, asymptomatic infections of the genital tract may lead to infertility. L. monocytogenes in adults may cause men-ingitis, meningoencephalitis, septicemia, endocarditis, and brain abscess. Patients receiving immunosuppressive ther-apy, suffering from immunosuppressive disease, are more susceptible to the infection. L. monocytogenes may cause occu-pation-related infections in poultry workers, butchers, and veterinarians. Due to direct contact with infected animals or birds or other products, these people may develop cutaneous infections. L. monocytogenes is distributed worldwide. It occurs as a saprophyte in soil, water, and sewage. It is also widely prevalent in different mammals or birds, fish, ticks, and crustaceans. The bacteria have been isolated from milk, cheese, and other milk products. The infection is transmitted by: ingestion of milk, milk products, and other food prepara-tions contaminated with the bacteria; direct contact with infected animal or animal products; and inhalation of contaminated dust. Many outbreaks of listeriosis caused by food contaminated with Listeria have been documented in Europe and North America. Nosocomial outbreaks of Listeria have also been documented in hospitals. Key Points Laboratory diagnosis of listeriosis depends on the isolation of L. monocytogenes from clinical specimens by culture: Cervical and vaginal secretions, meconium, blood, cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), amniotic fluid, placenta, and biopsy are frequently used specimens for diagnosis. Gram staining of the CSF smear is useful for detection of bacteria. This is positive in nearly 50% of the cases. Specimens are cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, and tryptose phosphate agar and incubated for 24-72 hours at 35-37\u00b0C. Isolation of bacteria is much more increased by cold enrichment. In this method, the specimens are stored in thioglycolate broth or tryptose phosphate at 4\u00b0C, and subcultures are carried out at weekly intervals for 1-6 months.Miscellaneous Chap-47.indd ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole. Cephalosporins are not useful for infections caused by Listeria. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae E. rhusiopathiae is a slender, straight or slightly curved, Gram-positive bacillus with a tendency toward formation of long filaments. It is nonmotile, nonsporing, and noncapsulated. It is catalase negative. It ferments glucose and lactose, producing acid but no gas. It is H 2S negative. It is MR, VP, indole, urease, and nitrate reduction test negative. It is aerobic and facultative anaerobic. The growth is improved in the presence of 5-10% CO 2. It can grow on nutrient agar and also on blood agar. After 24-48 hours of incubation, it produces convex and translucent colonies surrounded by a variable zone of alpha-hemolysis. On tellurite agar, it produces black colonies. E. rhusiopathiae occurs as a saprophyte in soil, food, and water. It occurs as a natural parasite of swines, mice, rabbits, turkeys, and many other animals. E. rhusiopathiae in humans causes septicemia, endocardi- tis, and erysipeloid. The latter is a localized infection of the skin that resembles streptococcal erysipelas. These cutaneous lesions are painful, edematous, and erythematous. They usu-ally occur on the hands or fingers of persons handling animals, fish, or animal products. The cutaneous lesions are usually associated with arthritis, lymphopharyngitis, or lymphadenitis. Diagnosis of the condition is made by the isolation of E. rhusiopathiae from pus and other clinical specimens by culture. The bacillus is sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin, motile due to presence of peritrichous flagella. They are strict aerobes and do not ferment sugars. They are usually oxi-dase positive. A. faecalis occurs as a saprophyte in water and soil contaminated with putrefied decayed organic matter. The bacteria are also found as commensals in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals. The bacterium causes urinary tract infection, infantile gastroenteritis, and typhoid-like fever in humans. Chromobacterium violaceum C. violaceum is a Gram-negative bacillus. It is catalase and oxidase positive but indole and urease negative. It is a motile bacterium due to presence of polar and lateral flagella. It is aerobic and facultative anaerobic. It grows on nutrient agar producing a nondiffusible violet pigment, which is soluble in ethanol and insoluble in chloroform and water. C. violaceum is found as saprophytes in water and soil, and in tropical and subtropical countries. Intestinal and genitourinary infections and septicemic illnesses with pneumonia are rare human infec-tions associated with the bacteria. The bacillus is sensitive to erythromycin, tetracycline, carbenicillin, and nonmotile bacterium. It is catalase and oxidase positive and weakly fermentative. It can grow on ordinary medium, such as nutrient agar. It produces smooth, circular, and glistening colonies after 24 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. On incubation at room temperature for 48 hours, it produces yellow, nondif-fusible pigment on the nutrient agar. F. meningosepticum is a ubiquitous saprophyte present in soil, water, food stuff, and moist environment. It can cause opportunistic infections and also neonatal meningitis in premature infants and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. In immunocompetent adults, it causes a mild illness. Novobiocin, rifampicin, clindamycin, and cefoxitin are effective granulomatous disease, which involves the genital and inguinal part of the infected host. C. granulomatis was first discovered by Donovan in 1905. He demonstrated the characteristic intracellular bodies in stained smears of pus from ulcer of a patient suffering from donovanosis, a sexually transmitted disease first described in India by Mac Leod. C. granulomatis is a small Gram- negative coccobacillus, which measures 1-2 /H11003 0.5-1.5 /H9262 m in size. The bacterium often shows bipolar staining, giving rise to safety-pin appearance. It is a capsulated bacterium but is nonmotile, nonsporing, and non-acid fast. It can be grown with difficulty on egg yolk medium or modified Levinthal agar. The bacterium grows readily in the yolk sac of embryo-nated egg. C. granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, which has an incubation period of few weeks to months. The condition manifests as the presence of subcutaneous nodules on geni-tal organs or in inguinal area. Subsequently, these nodules suppurate and break down, leading to formation of painless granulomatous lesions. Granuloma inguinale is seen in Caribbean islands and New Guinea. The condition is a sexually transmitted disease, transmitted through sexual contact. These organisms are found in the cytoplasm of histiocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes or remain free outside the cell. These are called Donovan bodies. About 1-25 bacteria can be found within a mononuclear phagocyte. Chap-47.indd 400 5/14/2012 12:17:25 PMSection III Chapter 47MISCELLANEOUS BACTERIA 401 Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by demon- strating these characteristic Donovan bodies within mono-nuclear phagocytes. Specimen is collected by scraping the border of the ulcerative lesion and making a smear on a glass slide. The smears are stained with Giemsa or Wright stains. In the stained smear, the body of the bacillus is stained blue and the capsule is stained pink. Tetracyclines, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa- zole are effective for treatment condition. Streptobacillus and Spirillum Streptobacillus moniliformis and Spirillum minus are the natural pathogens of rodents. Both these agents cause a same condi-tion called rat-bite fever. Streptobacillus /H9262m) that stains poorly with Gram staining. The bacteria may appear as a string of beads containing granules. The bacterium may lose its cell wall and readily develop into L forms. S. moniliformis is an aerobe and facultative anaerobe and highly fastidious bacterium. It is catalase, oxi-dase, indole, urease, and nitrate negative. It ferments glucose with production of acid but no gas. The bacterium is a slow grower. It grows on enriched media supplemented with 15% blood, 20% horse or calf serum, or 5% ascitic fluid. It produces discrete, granular or smooth, gray colonies after 3 days of incu-bation at 35-36\u00b0C in a humid aerobic condition. S. moniliformis causes rat-bite fever, a condition characterized by relapsing fever, rash, and arthralgia. Incubation period varies from 2 to 10 days. The condition manifests with sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgias followed by a petechial rash and arthritis. In untreated cases, relapses are common. Rat-bite fever is usually caused by the bite of a rat or occasionally by the bite of a mouse, cat, squirrel, or dog. The disease also occurs without rat bite and is believed to occur due to ingestion of raw meat or water contaminated by excreta of the rat. This condition is known as Haverhill's fever or erythema arthricum epidemicum. Key Points Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by culture of the bacillus from blood or other body fluids. Serological tests, such as indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, complement fixation test, and agglutination test are frequently useful for diagnosis. All these tests use S. moniliformis as antigen. A serum titer of 1:80 or more, or a fourfold rise between acute and convalescent sera is considered diagnostic of the disease. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for treatment of cases of rat-bite fever. Cephalosporins, erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline are also used to treat the condition.Spirillum minus S. minus is a short, spiral, Gram-negative bacillus and measures 0.2-0.5 /H11003 3-5 /H9262 m in size. It is with the pres- ence of 1-5 amphitrichous flagella. The bacteria stain poorly with Gram stain, but stain better with Giemsa or Fontana stains. S. minus also causes rat-bite fever similar to that caused by S. moniliformis , but with few differences in the clinical manifestations: Rat-bite fever caused by S. minus has a long incubation period of 2-4 weeks. The condition may manifest as suppuration of the rat-bite wound, and the onset of fever is associated with regional lymphadenopathy. Mortality is relatively less (6%) in untreated cases. Other clinical manifestations of rat bite are similar to that caused by S. moniliformis. S. minus organisms like the S. moniliformis are found in the nasopharynx of rats and other small rodents. They are transmitted to humans by the bite of these animals but not by contaminated water or milk as seen with S. moniliformis. Dark field microscopic examination of blood, pus, or lymph node aspirate is useful to demonstrate S. minus. Microscopy of Giemsa- or Wright-stained blood smear is also useful. Animal inoculation is a frequently used method for diagnosis. In this method, clinical specimens are inoculated intraperitoneally into rodents following which these pathogens can be demon-strated in the blood and the peritoneal fluid of these rodents, 1-3 weeks after inoculation. Serology is not useful. Rat-bite fever caused by S. minus can be treated with both penicillin and tetracycline. Table 47-1 shows a comparison between rat-bite fever caused by Streptobacillus and Spirillum species. Legionella Legionella are ubiquitous aquatic saprophytes present world-wide. Many of these species are found in the environment and are also associated with human infections. L. pneumophila is an important species, which causes both community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. History Legionella as the causative agent of pneumonia was first identi-fied in 1976 during the annual convention of American Legion held at a hotel in Philadelphia. The infection was believed to be transmitted from the contaminated water in the hotel's air con-ditioning system. A total of 182 cases were detected; of which 29 patients died because of the disease. The disease was charac-terized by fever, cough, and chest pain, leading to pneumonia and often death of the patient. This condition was referred to as Legionnaire's disease, and the causative agent isolated from the fatal cases was designated as L. pneumophila. Family Legionellaceae consists of one genus, Legionella which contains 39 genetically defined species and more than Chap-47.indd 401 5/14/2012 12:17:25 PMSection III Chapter 47402 BACTERIOLOGY 60 serogroups. Many of these species cause infections in humans. Legionellosis is the term used for infections caused by different Legionella species. Legionnaire's disease is the term used to describe the pneumonia caused by L. pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila L. pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, as well as of Pontiac fever. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology L. pneumophila shows following features: L. pneumophila is a small, slender, pleomorphic, Gram- negative bacillus. L. pneumophila organisms in clinical specimens stain poorly with Gram staining. They can by stained better by silver impregnation method using Dieterle silver stain. It measures 0.3-0.9 /H11003 2-5 /H9262m with pointed ends and tendency to form filaments in culture on solid media. It is motile by means of one or more polar or subpolar flagella. It is nonsporing and non-acid fast. Culture L. pneumophila is a strict aerobe, grows at an optimum temper-ature of 35\u00b0C and an optimum pH of 6.9. It is nutritionally fastidious and grows on the medium supplemented with iron salts and L-cysteine. Buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar : The agar containing buffered charcoal, yeast extract, and cysteine is a useful medium for growth of L. pneumophila. It is a slow-growing bacterium and may take 3-5 days to produce visible colonies. The colonies on BCYE agar are circular, gray, or gray-blue and low convex with a slightly irregular margin. Under the microscope, the colonies typically have a ground glass appearance. Biochemical reactions L. pneumophila shows following biochemical properties: It is mostly nonfermenter and derives its energy from the metabolism of amino acids. It does not ferment any sugars and is urease and nitrate test negative. It is catalase positive, oxidase variable, and liquefies gelatin. It hydrolyzes starch and hippurate. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: L. pneumoph-ila is readily killed by 70% ethyl alcohol, 2% glutaraldehyde, and 1% formaldehyde. It is also killed by residual chlorine (5 ppm of chlorine) in chlorinated water in 1 minute, by 1.25 ppm of chlorine in 15 minutes, and by 0.65 ppm of chlorine in 1 hour. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure On the basis of direct immunofluorescence and slide aggluti-nation tests, a total of 15 serogroups (1-15) of L. pneumophila have been identified. Of these, three serogroups (1, 4, and 6) are primarily associated with human disease. Nearly, 80% of the cases of legionellosis disease caused by L. pneumophila are believed due to serogroup 1. L. pneumophila possesses both flagellar and somatic antigens. obligate or facultative intracellular pathogen. Virulence factors The capability of the bacteria to multiply in macrophages and their ability to prevent phagolysosome fusion are the main determinants of virulence of the bacteria. L. pneumophila organisms possess many virulence factors, such as protease, hemolysin, and cytotoxin. Protease is an important virulence factor, which plays an important role in causing infection.Streptobacillus moniliformis Spirillum minus Incubation period Short (10 days) Long (15 days) Symptoms High fever, headache, chills, myalgia, rash, arthritis, arthralgia; and recurrent fever if untreatedFever, headache, chills, rash, lymphangitis, lymphadenitis; and recurrent fever if untreated Diagnosis Culture and serology Dark ground microscopy, microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood smear, and animal inoculation Antibiotic therapy Penicillin (L forms not sensitive to penicillin). Both forms sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline.PenicillinIn case of endocarditis, addition of an aminoglycoside Mortality Higher if untreated (10%) Lower if untreated (6%)TABLE 47-1 Comparison of rat-bite disease The bacteria infect human monocytes and alveolar macro-phages. The bacteria multiply in macrophages and mono-cytes by binding complement to an outer membrane porin protein and subsequent deposition of C3b, a component of the complement on the surface of the bacteria. This facilitates them to combine with CR3 complement receptors on phago-cytes and enter the cell through endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the bacteria are not killed because they prevent fusion of phagolysosome. Subsequently, the bacteria multiply in large numbers in the intracellular vacuoles and produce many enzymes, such as phosphatase, lipase, nuclease, and proteo-lytic enzymes. Subsequently they lyse and kill the infected host cell. Host immunity Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the host immunity by preventing the intracellular growth of Legionella spp. Sensitized T cells stimulate the increased antimicrobial activity of parasitized macrophages. Humoral immunity plays a minor role. Clinical Sydromes L. pneumophila causes two distinct clinical entities\u2014Legionnaire's disease and Pontiac fever. Legionnaire's disease Incubation period varies from 2 to 10 days. Pneumonia is the primary manifestation of Legionnaire's disease with multilob-ular consolidation, inflammation, and abscesses in the lung. Fever, chills, dry or nonproductive cough, and pleuritic or non-pleuritic chest pain are the common symptoms of the disease. Hemoptysis is rare. The condition becomes more severe and is associated with much morbidity and high mortality if not treated immediately. Decreased pulmonary function, pulmonary fibrosis or scarring, abscess formation in the lungs, and fulminant respiratory failure are the important complications of pul-monary disease. Progressive respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in patients with Legionnaire's disease. The mortality may be as high as 80% in untreated patients. It may be nearly 50% in nosocomial infections of patients with underlying diseases. Extrapulmonary mani-festations include myocarditis, pericarditis, and prosthetic valve endocarditis. They also include peritonitis and acute renal failure. Pontiac fever Pontiac fever is a mild, self-limiting condition. The condition presents as fever and myalgia that resolve without treatment. Table 47-2 compares the Legionnaire's disease and Pontiac fever caused by L. pneumophila. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Legionnaire's disease is prevalent worldwide. This is respon-sible for 2-15% of all community-acquired pneumonia that requires hospitalization. Habitat L. pneumophila is an obligate intracellular pathogen found in alveolar macrophages in the infected human host. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection L. pneumophila is a saprophyte widely found in aquatic environments. The bacteria have been isolated from a variety of man-made water environments, such as hot water system in hotels and hospitals, cooling water system, air conditioning cooling tow-ers, shower heads, industrial coolants, and respiratory ventilators. The factors that contribute to the presence of these bacteria in these environments include (a) stagnation of water, (b) tem-perature of water varying from 25 to 40\u00b0C, and (c) presence of free-living amoeba, such as Acanthamoeba and Bartonella species, Legionnaire's disease Pontiac fever Incubation period 2-10 days 1-2 days Disease More severe, much morbidity, and causes death if therapy not started promptlyMild febrile illness, minimal morbidity, and causes no death if resolved spontaneously Mortality Higher if delay in treatment (15-20%) Negligible (less than 1%) Antibiotic therapy Needed Not needed, self-limited Distribution Epidemic and sporadic Epidemic Reservoir No animal or human reservoir No animal or human reservoir Source Contaminated water source Contaminated water source Pathogenesis Legionellae engulfed by monocytes and survive as intracellular parasites.Subsequently, and kill infected host cellPathogenesis not well understoodTABLE 47-2 Comparison of Legionnaire's disease and 5/14/2012 12:17:25 PMSection support the growth of Legionella. Therefore, contami-nated water is the primary source of infection. Transmission to humans occurs by the following routes: Inhalation of aerosolized mist from contaminated water source, which is contaminated with either the bacteria or free-living amoeba infected with the bacteria. Nosocomial infection is transmitted through aspiration, contaminated water, or respiratory equipments. Infection is also transmitted by the use of nebulizers, humidifiers, and other instruments that have been washed with contaminated tap water. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Animals also do not play any role in transmission of the infection. The elderly people, people with chronic heart or lung diseases, and the patients who are in immunocompromised state or are receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at greatest risk for the disease. This is because of their depressed cell-mediated immunity and altered pulmonary functions. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Sputum, lung fluid, pleural fluid, transtracheal aspirations, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are the respiratory specimens frequently used for the diagnosis of the condition. Blood is also used for culture. Microscopy Gram staining of the sputum or other respiratory specimens may show many leukocytes, but the organisms are rarely demonstrated. Bacteria, if found, are very poorly stained. Dieterle silver or Gimenez stain can be used to demonstrate bacteria. Direct antigen detection Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test is a sensitive method to detect Legionella spp. in sputum and other specimens. This test uses fluorescent-labeled monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies produced against Legionella species. This is a rapid test; result can be obtained within 2-4 hours. The test shows a high specificity of 96-99% using the monoclonal antibodies. However, this test has a low sensitivity. The sensitivity of DFA depends on the presence of a large number of bacteria in specimen. Therefore, sensitivity is increased if samples from lower respiratory tract are used. Positive DFA test becomes negative in 4-6 days of treatment. Culture Isolation of Legionella spp. from sputum or other respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage, transtracheal aspiration, and bronchoscopic specimens) by culture is the definitive method for diagnosis of Legionella infection. Blood culture shows very low sensitivity.BCYE agar is the medium most frequently used for culture of the bacteria. The bacteria produce small colonies after 3-5 days of incubation on BCYE agar at 35\u00b0C presence CO 2. Bronchoalveolar lavage, transtracheal aspiration, and bronchoscopic specimens increase the sensitivity of the culture. However, blood culture shows very low sensitivity. Serodiagnosis IFA test and ELISA are the most commonly used antibody-based serological tests for the diagnosis of Legionella infection. IFA titer of 1:256 or more on a single serum is diagnostic. A fourfold or greater increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum to 1:128 or greater in titer is also con-sidered diagnostic of the disease. Antigen detection ELISA, radio immunoassay (RIA), and the latex agglutina-tion test are used to detect Legionella lipopolysaccharide anti-gen in the urine and respiratory specimens. The antigens are demonstrated in more than two-thirds of the patients during 1-3 days of clinical disease. The urinary antigen detection is rel-atively rapid and simple and can even detect antigen excreted in patients who are on antibiotic therapy. Disadvantage of the test is that it can detect only L. pneumophila (serogroup 1 antigen). The antigens continue to be present in urine even for months after the infection has resolved. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a specific method for detection of Legionella spp. in urine, serum, and bronchoalveo-lar lavage fluid. The main advantage of this method is that it can detect infections caused by Legionella species other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Treatment Erythromycin or tetracycline is useful for treatment of community-acquired infections. Fluoroquinolones, such as doxycycline, telithromycin, and azithromycin, are recom-mended for treatment of severe cases. Beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides are not useful. Prevention and Control Hyperchlorination of water and superheating of water to 70-80\u00b0C has proved to be of value in preventing the disease. Complete elimination of bacteria from water, however, is difficult. Bartonella Members of the genus Bartonella are very small Gram-negative bacilli transmitted by arthropods. The bacteria are Gram-negative aerobic bacilli and are fastidious in growth. They cause Chap-47.indd 404 5/14/2012 12:17:25 PMSection III Chapter 47MISCELLANEOUS BACTERIA 405 infections in mammalian host by invading endothelial cells and red blood cells. Bartonella species are found in a variety of animal hosts and are typically present without evidence of the disease. The genus Bartonella consists of 11 species, of which five are associated with human diseases (Table 47-3). Bartonella bacilliformis B. bacilliformis is the causative agent of Oroya fever, an acute febrile illness consisting of severe anemia. This condition was first identified in the mountainous parts of Peru in 1870 during the laying of railway lines from Lima to Oroya in Peru. The outbreak of Oroya fever killed 1000 of workers associated with this railway project. B. bacilliformis are short Gram-negative coccobacilli measur- ing 0.3-0.5 /H11003 1.0-1.7 /H9262m. The bacteria occur singly, in pairs, in chains, or in clumps. They are motile by the presence of as many as 10 flagella at one pole of the bacteria. They are aerobic and require an optimum pH of 7.8 and optimum temperature of 25-28\u00b0C for their growth. Oroya fever is restricted in its geographical distribution and is mainly confined to Peru, Columbia, and Ecuador in South America. The laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by demonstration of intracellular bacteria in blood smear stained by Giemsa. The bacteria are found in the cytoplasm. Bacteria can be isolated from blood in enriched blood agar. Penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chlorampheni- col are effective for the treatment of B. bacilliformis infection. Use of insecticides, such as DDT to kill the sand fly prevents transmission of the disease. Bartonella quintana B. quintana was earlier known as Rochalimaea quintana as a causative agent of trench fever or five-day fever. This condi-tion was first recognized in the soldiers fighting in trenches in Europe during the first World War. The causative agent was earlier identified as a rickettsia and named Rickettsia quin-tana because it caused a five-day fever (from quintana, means fifth), a synonym for trench fever. The organism subsequently was found not to be a rickettsia and differed from latter by its ability to grow in cell-free media, such as blood agar, hence was separated into a new genus Rochalimaea. Currently, it has undergone further taxonomical classification and has been reclassified as B. quintana. B. quintana is a small Gram-negative bacillus (0.3-0.5 /H11003 1.0-1.7 /H9262m) and is nonmotile. It grows slowly on sheep or rabbit blood agar at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO 2. It requires prolonged incubation of 1-2 weeks to produce demonstrable colonies. B. quintana is transmitted by the body louse. The lice become infectious 5-9 days after feeding on a trench fever patient, after which the lice remain infectious throughout their life and excrete organisms in their feces. The infected lice when bites a new host defecates on surface of the skin. When this feces comes in contact with minor scratches or abrasions on the surface of the skin, the bacteria present in the feces enter the skin and initiate the infection. Trench fever has an incubation period of 14-30 days. The condition can vary from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection. Severe headache, fever (giving the name of the disease as five-day fever), chills, weakness, and severe pain in the back and legs are the common manifestations of symptomatic cases. The condition is also associated with the presence of rashes on the chest, abdomen, or back. The infection does not cause death of the patient, but can produce a very severe debilitating illness.Trench fever is an exclusively human disease. No animal reser-voir for this disease has been identified. The disease is transmit-ted from humans to humans by the human body louse vector. Key Points Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolation of the bacte-ria from patient's blood on blood agar after 2 weeks of incubation. The organism can also be demonstrated in lice after allowing the healthy lice to feed up on the patient (xenodiagnosis). Weil-Felix test used for diagnosis of rickettsial infection is negative in trench fever. The condition can be treated with gentamicin alone or with erythromycin. Bartonella henselae B. causative agent of cat-scratch disease. The dis-ease follows scratches and bite of the cat or with the bite of cat fleas. B. henselae is a small Gram-negative bacillus measur-ing 2.0-2.5 /H11003 0.5-0.6 /H9262m. Like other Bartonella on chocolate agar or Columbia agar supplemented with 5% sheep or rabbit blood. B. henselae produces dry white cauli-flower-like colonies after 5-15 days of incubation at 35-37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2. B. henselae typically causes cat-scratch disease. It is a benign con- dition characterized by regional lymphadenopathy and fever. The cervical and axillary lymph nodes are most commonly affected. Usually, single lymph node is affected in 50% of the cases. B. henselae also causes bacillary angiomatosis, a condition resembling Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS. The skin, lymph nodes, or liver and spleen are primarily involved in this con-dition. The bacteria also cause subacute bacterial endocarditis.Bacteria PMSection III Chapter 47406 BACTERIOLOGY Laboratory diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of clusters of B. henselae in lymph node biopsy smears stained with Warthin Starry impregnation stain. The bacteria can also be isolated by cul-ture on chocolate agar or Columbia agar enriched with sheep or rabbit blood on incubation for 3 weeks or more. Gentamicin and erythromycin are effective for the treatment of the condition. Capnocytophaga Members of the genus Capnocytophaga are filamentous Gram- negative bacilli. They are slow-growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and require presence of CO 2 for their growth. The genus is classified into two groups: (a) dysgonic fermenter 1 (DF-1) and (b) dysgonic fermenter and Capnocytophaga sputigena, which are found as members of the normal flora of oropharynx in humans. These species have been associated with periodon-titis and bacteremia. They occasionally cause severe systemic disease, such as endocarditis in immunocompromised host. DF-2 group bacteria are found only in dogs and not in humans. Most Capnocytophaga strains are resistant to aminoglycosides but are sensitive to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, fluoroqui-nolones, and Corynebacterium vaginalis or Haemophilus vaginalis. Since the bacterium does not require X and V growth factors, it has been shifted from the genus Haemophilus and has been placed in the genus Gardnerella. The bacterium is present as a commensal in the male urethra and vagina. G. vaginalis are small, pleomorphic, Gram-negative rods, which are sometimes Gram variable. They are nonsporing, nonmotile, and noncapsulated. G. vaginalis causes nonspecific vaginitis and cervicitis, frequently in association with anaero-bic vaginosis. The condition is characterized by foul-smelling vaginal discharge with a fishy odor and acidic pH. High vaginal swab or endocervical swab with exudate material is the specimen required for diagnosis of the condi-tion. The specimens are transported in the Stuart medium. Gram staining of the smear shows Gram-variable small bacilli and presence of clue cells. These clue cells are the vaginal epithelial cells covered with many small Gram-variable rods. The bacteria is cultured on a blood agar and incubated anaer-obically at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours for colonies. The colonies of G. vaginalis are identified by Gram staining, negative catalase test, and positive hippurate hydrolysis test. G. vaginalis is sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim. It is resistant to gentamicin, nalidixic acid, and colistin. Metronidazole is the drug of choice. A 29-year-old software engineer working in Peru for the past 1 year came back to India with complaints of myalgia, arthral-gia, headache, severe anemia, and also hepatosplenomegaly. Routine laboratory studies were negative. Blood smear stained by Giemsa stain showed intracellular bacteria. Blood culture showed colonies, which were identified as Bartonella bacilliformis. Diagnose the disease. What are the other laboratory t ests used for diagnosis of the disease? How will you treat the condition? Is this condition present in India?CASE STUDY Chap-47.indd multiply within cytoplasm of cells. They have very small genome composed of 1-1.5 million base pairs. These organisms, because of their small size, were once thought to be viruses. Nevertheless, these organisms are bacteria because they show following characteristics: 1. They have typical Gram-negative cell walls. 2. They contain both DNA and RNA, enzymes for the Kreb's cycle, and ribosomes f or protein synthesis. 3. They multiply by binary fission. 4. They are susceptible to antibiotics. Ricke ttsiae are primary pathogens of arthropods, such as lice, fleas, ticks, and mites. In these hosts, they are found in their intestinal tract. They are usually transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors, such as lice, mites, ticks, etc. Coxiella burnetii causing Q fever is an exception, which is transmitted usually by airborne droplets. They also infect humans in whom they are found in the reticuloendothelial cells and vascular endothelium. Classification Rickettsiae are a group of bacteria that phylogenetically occupy a position between bacteria and viruses. These pathogens are included in the order Rickettsiales, tribe Rickettsiae, and family Rickettsiaceae. Family Rickettsiaceae comprises Rickettsia, Orientia, and Ehrlichia. Earlier the genus Coxiella was included in the family Rickettsiaceae but now has been excluded from it, because unlike other genera of the family Rickettsiaceae Coxiella organisms are not primarily obligate intracellular parasites. They can grow in cell-free media. Rickettsiae are strict intracellular parasites, but their intracellular locations vary. Rickettsia and Orientia are free in cyto-plasm, whereas Coxiella and Ehrlichia are found in cytoplasmic vacuoles. These bacteria synthesize proteins and produce adenos-ine diphosphate by tricarboxylic acid cycle. The exact reason why these bacteria grow inside cells is not understood. It is suggested that these bacteria are energy parasites, which use ATP in host cell till it is available. They also use available host amino acids and host cell coenzyme A and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Cell wall of all the four genera is typical of Gram-negative bacteria. They have lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidogly-can layer. The LPS shows weak endotoxic activity. The bacteria are nonmotile, they do not have any flagella, and instead are surrounded by a loose slime layer. Rickettsiae that cause human diseases are summarized in Table 48-1. Genus Rickettsia Rickettsia organisms cause a wide variety of diseases varying considerably in severity from self-limiting illness to fulminat-ing, life-threatening infection. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology They are small, Gram-negative coccobacilli varying from0.3-0.6 to 0.8-2 m in size. They are nonmotile and noncapsu- lated. They are stained poorly with Gram stain but are stained well with the following: deep red with Machiavello and Gimenez stain and bluish purple with Giemsa and Castaneda stain. Culture Rickettsiae fail to grow on cell-free media. They usually grow inside the cell, usually in the cytoplasm (most Rickettsia) or in the nucleus of the cell (Rickettsia causing spotted fever). Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia, pox Rickettsia conori Boutonneuse fever (i.e., Kenya tick bite fever, African tick typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, Indian tick typhus, and Marseilles fever) Orientia sibirica North Asian Human Chapter 48408 They grow well at optimum temperature of 32-35 /H11034C. They grow in various cell lines, in the developing chick embryo, and also in many laboratory animals.Cell lines: They grow on HeLa, Hep2, Detriot-6, mouse fibro-blasts, and other continuous cells lines. Cultures in the cell lines are used primarily for the maintenance of Rickettsia but are not useful for primary isolation of Rickettsia from clinical specimens.Chick embryo: In the developing chick embryo 5-6 days old, Rickettsia spp. grow well in the yolk sac. The inoculated eggs are incubated at 35/H11034C for most Rickettsia spp. and at 33/H11034C for spot-ted group. The yolk sac is widely used as a source of Rickettsia for preparation of rickettsial antigens and vaccines. Rickettsia shows poor growth on chorioallantoic membrane.Laboratory animals: Guinea pigs and mice are the commonly used laboratory animals for isolation of Rickettsia organisms from animal specimens. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: The extra-cellular Rickettsia organisms are very delicate microorganisms. They are rapidly killed by heating at 56 /H11034C and also at room temperature. They are destroyed by usual strength of antiseptics, such as hypochlorite, 1% ethanol, 2% formaldehyde, 5% hydro-gen and 70% ethanol. They are preserved at /H11002 70/H11034C or in a lyophilized state. They are preserved better in a special medium known as SPG medium containing sucrose, potassium phosphate, and glutamate, and also in the skimmed milk. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Rickettsia possesses three different types of antigens as follows: 1. Group-specific antigen: This is a soluble antigen present on sur face of the organisms. This is extracted from rickett- sial pathogens by antigen: Species-specific or strain-specific antigen (e.g., scrub typhus) is present in the cell wall of the bacteria. 3. Alkali-stable polysaccharide antigen: This is a sur face anti- gen found in some species of Rickettsia and in some strains of Proteus species (Proteus OX19, OX2, and OXK). This sharing of antigen between Rickettsia and Proteus forms the basis of Weil- Felix test, which is employed for diagnosis of rickettsial infec-tions by demonstration of antibodies using Proteus strains. Typhus Fever Group Typhus refers to a group of infectious diseases that are caused by different rickettsial organisms. These are of three types. 1. Epidemic or louse-borne typhus caused by Rickettsia prow azekii. 2. Relapsing louse-borne typhus or Brill-Zinsser's disease by R. prowazekii. 3. Endemic or f lea-borne murine typhus caused typhi.Rickettsia prowazekii R. prowazekii the causative agent of epidemic typhus, also called louse-borne typhus. This condition is an acute febrile illness transmitted by human body louse Pediculus humanus corporis. R. prowazekii is named after the scientist Von Prowazek who died of the typhus fever while studying the disease. This typhus fever is an ancient disease and has been reported from all parts of the world. This disease was widely prevalent in Russia and in Eastern Europe. This disease was also respon-sible for Napolean's defeat in Russia in 1812. This was one of the three diseases responsible for misery and sufferings during the Irish famine of 1845-1850. Properties of the Bacteria R. prowazekii organisms like other rickettsiae are small, Gram-negative, intracellular bacteria. They stain poorly with Gram stain, but stain best with Giemsa or Gimenez stain. Like other rickettsiae, they can grow in various tissue cultures (HeLa, Hep2, Detriot-6, mouse fibroblasts, and other continuous cells lines) and in yolk sac of embryonated egg. Other properties Like other rickettsiae, they are susceptible to various physical and chemical agents, as described earlier. Pathogenesis and Immunity R. prowazekii is an invasive bacterium, which characteristically multiplies in endothelial cells of the blood vessels, leading to vasculitis. Virulence factors The capability to multiply inside the cell is important mecha-nism of the disease process caused by R. prowazekii. Adhesins are the most important virulent factor of rickettsia. These are outer membrane proteins, which facilitate the entry of rick-ettsiae into the host cells. Once inside the cells, they remain, multiply, and accumulate in large numbers before lysing the host cell. Pathogenesis of rickettsial infections After inoculation from the infected sites, the rickettsiae reach the circulation, multiply, and cause rickettsemia. Rickettsiae are localized in the endothelial cells of small arterial capillary and venous vessels. At these sites, they multiply and cause endothelial cellular hyperplasia resulting in multiorgan vas-culitis. The process may end in thrombosis and development of small nodules. Thrombosis of supplying blood vessels may cause gangrene of the extremities, ear lobes, nose, and genitalia. The vasculitis process also may result in increased vascular permeability with consequent edema, loss of blood volume, hypoalbuminemia, osmotic pressure, and Brill-Zinsser's disease is an example of a recrudescent case of typhus fever, which is observed in some people. The exact mechanism responsible for the recrudescence is not known. Clinical Syndromes R. prowazekii causes epidemic typhus and recrudescent typhus. Epidemic typhus Incubation period varies from as low as 2-3 days to an aver-age period of 8 days. Epidemic typhus is characterized by high fever, severe headache, and chills. Appearance of a petechial or macular rash on the fourth or fifth day\u2014first starting on the trunk and then spreading over to the extremities but without affecting the face, palms, and sole\u2014is the characteristic feature of the condition. This rash is seen in nearly 40% of patients. The patient if left untreated may become stuporous and delirious. The name typhus is derived from the word \"typhus\", meaning cloud or smoke, which denotes cloudy state of con-sciousness in the disease process. Myocarditis and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction are the noted complications of epidemic typhus. The disease is associated with mortality rate as high as 60% in old or debilitated persons. Recrudescent typhus This condition was seen in some patients treated with antibiot-ics and has been apparently cured of the disease. R. prowazekii in such patients may persist in their body tissues, may reemerge, and cause a recurrence of typhus fever months, years, or even decades after antibiotic treatment. This condition is called recrudescent typhus. This disease was first noticed by Brill in 1988, and R. prowazekii were isolated from the areas in 1934. Hence, the disease is also called Brill-Zinsser disease. Improper or incomplete antibiotic therapy, poor general health, and malnutrition are some of the risk factors that may predispose a person to recrudescence. The presentation of this disease is less severe and mortality is much lower than the epidemic typhus. Epidemiology Epidemic typhus is a disease known since ancient times. Geographical distribution Epidemic typhus is present in Central and South America, Africa (Ethiopia and Nigeria), Northern China, and in India. Habitat R. prowazekii organisms are obligate intracellular parasites of humans and arthropod hosts. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the primary reservoir of the epidemic typhus and are the sources of infection. The lice become infected with R. prowazekii after feeding on a person suffering from typhus fever or from Brill-Zinsser disease. Body louse, P. humanus corporis, is the arthropod vector of epidemic typhus. Occasionally, the head louse P. humanus capitis may transmit the infection, but not the pubic louse. R. prowazekii, the causative agent of typhus, lives and multiplies in the ali mentary tract of louse. The bacteria are excreted in feces within 3-5 days of infection. The lice are the only arthro-pod vector for rickettsial infection, which die after the infec-tion (Fig. 48-1). Infection is transmitted to humans when a rickettsia-harboring louse bites a human during a blood meal. Typically, lice defecate while feeding. When the host scratches the bite, the louse is crushed and the contaminated louse feces are inoculated into the minute lesions of the bite wound. From the infected sites the rickettsiae reach the circu-lation, multiply, and cause rickettsemia. Rarely, infection may also be transmitted through the conjunctiva or through inhala-tion of aerosols of dry louse feces. The disease epidemic typhus is much more common among people living in crowded and unhygienic conditions, which facilitate spread of the body lice from one person to another. Such condition is commonly seen during wars, famines, and natural disasters as people live closely together. Laboratory Diagnosis Diagnosis of rickettsial diseases, including epidemic typhus caused by R. prowazekii, is made by isolation of rickettsia in ani-mal models or by serological tests. Culture Rickettsiae are highly infectious pathogens; therefore, isolation of these pathogens from clinical specimens is carried out only in the laboratory equipped with high safety provision. Key Points Rickettsiae isolation is carried out in male guinea pigs or mice by inoculating the clinical specimen intraperitoneally (Table 48-2). After inoculation, the animals are observed for 3-4 weeks. The response of animals to different rickettsial infections may vary: R. prowazekii infection produces fever without any testicu-lar inflammation. Infection with R. typhi, R. conori, and R. akari develops fever and tunica reaction. Rickettsia causing rocky mountain spotted fever causes fever and scrotal necrosis in guinea pigs. The guinea pigs may even die of the disease. Smears from peritoneum, tunica, and spleen of the infected animals may be stained by Giemsa and Gimenez methods to detect these pathogens. Rickettsiae may be isolated by growing in the cell culture. They grow better on Vero cells, in three and half days. The rickettsiae in these infected cell lines are identified by immunofluores-cence, using group-specific and strain-specific monoclonal antibodies. Isolation of rickettsia in the eggs or chick embryos is usually not followed for primary isolation of rickettsia from clinical specimens. Chap-48.indd a heterologous agglutination test used since long for diagnosis of rickettsial infections. The test detects antirickettsial antibodies that cross-react with O anti-gens of certain nonmotile strains of Proteus test becomes positive 10-20 days after infection; sera from epidemic typhus strongly react with OX19 antigen and weakly agglutinate with OX2 antigen. They do not agglutinate with OXK antigen. Weil-Felix test is negative or weakly reactive in Brill-Zinsser disease. Reactions of Weil-Felix test in other rickettsial infections are summarized in Table 48-3. Complement fixation test, hemagglutination, indi- rect immunofluorescence, latex agglutination, and tests, which employ rickettsial anti-gens for demonstration of rickettsial antibodies for diagnosis of rickettsial infections including R. prowazekii. Of these meth-ods, the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test is the method of choice for diagnosis of epidemic typhus.Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to detect rickettsia in blood or tissue for early diagnosis of the condition. Treatment Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are the drugs of choice for the treatment of epidemic typhus. Antibiotic therapy in combination with treatment of louse infestation of the human host is effective. Prevention and Control Control of human lice population and sanitation are the effec-tive measures to control epidemic typhus. Vaccines A live vaccine containing attenuated \"E\" strain of R. prowa-zekii is available and is recommended for use in high-risk population. Rickettsia typhi R. typhi is the causative agent of endemic or murine typhus. Properties of the Bacteria and Pathogenesis and Immunity The morphology, cultural characteristics, and pathogenesis of the disease caused by R. typhi are similar to that caused by R. prowazekii. Infection with R. typhi can confer immunity to subsequent infection. Clinical Syndrome The typhus fever caused by R. typhi is a milder disease than the epidemic typhus and has a shorter duration. The incubation period varies from 7 to 14 days. The condition has a sudden onset of symptoms with fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. A rash develops on third to fifth day of infection in approximately Rickettsial diseases louseEpidemic or louse borne 48-1. Transmission EHRLICHIA, AND COXIELLA 411 half of the infected patients. The rash is typically present on the chest and abdomen but may spread to palms and soles. Untreated course of the disease may last up to 3 weeks. The endemic typhus differs from epidemic in being a mild illness of shorter duration, associated with few complications and case fatality rate less than 1%. Epidemiology The murine typhus occurs in many parts of the world par-ticularly in subtropical temperate coastal areas. The condi-tion occurs mainly in sporadic forms. Rats (Rattus rattus), mice, and cats are the natural reservoirs of infection. Humans are the accidental hosts. Rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) or cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis ) are the main vectors responsible for the transmission of disease. Endemic or flea-borne murine typhus is transmitted from rats to rats by a rat flea and accidentally to humans by the feces of infected fleas. Fleas become infected by feeding on the mice, cat, or other natural host. These infected fleas may subsequently transmit the disease to humans during act of biting. During bite, they transmit the disease by direct inoculation or indirect inoculation of the infected feces into the site of the bite. The cat flea C. felis may also transmit the disease. The infection can also be transmitted by inoculation or inhalation of aerosolized infectious specimens. The infection may also be transmitted by ingestion and food contaminated with infected rat urine or flea feces. Laboratory Diagnosis Weil-Felix test used for diagnosis of epidemic typhus is also used for the diagnosis of endemic typhus. IFA test using R. typhi-specific antigen is used as a specific test for serodiagnosis of endemic typhus. A single titer of 1:128 or a fourfold rise in antibody titer in paired sera is diagnostic of the disease. R. typhi is differentiated from R. prowazekii by Neil Mooser reaction and by partial DNA homology. Key Points Neil Mooser or tunica reaction Performed in an adult male guinea pig. The specimens (e.g., blood from the case of endemic typhus or R. typhi culture) are inoculated intraperitoneally. The animal is observed for the development of fever and a characteristic scrotal inflammation. In a positive test, the scrotum becomes enlarged and the testis cannot be pushed back into the layer of tunica vaginalis. This reaction is known as Neil Mooser or tunica vaginalis reaction. R. typhi shows positive Neil Mooser reaction. R. prowazekii shows negative Neil Mooser reaction (Table 48-2). Treatment Tetracycline, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol are highly effective in the treatment of endemic typhus.Prevention and Control Control of endemic typhus is difficult because the fleas caus-ing the disease are distributed widely. The control measures are essentially based on the control of rodent population and flea population in the area endemic for disease. Spotted Fever Group Spotted fever group of rickettsial diseases include: Rocky Mountain spotted fever caused by Rickettsia rickettsiae, Rickettsial pox caused by R. akari, and Boutonneuse fever (i.e., Kenya tick-bite fever, African tick typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, Indian tick typhus, and Marseilles fever) caused by R. conori. Rickettsiae of this group possess a common soluble group antigen. They also multiply in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. All these species except R. akari are transmitted by ticks. A total of 12 species of rickettsiae have been associated with humans causing spotted fever and seven species have been isolated from arthropod vectors. R. rickettsiae is the most common species belonging to the spotted fever group and is responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rickettsia rickettsiae R. rickettsiae causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the most seri-ous type of spotted fever. Rocky Mountain spotted fever was the first among the spotted fever group to be described. This dis-ease was earlier called as Mediterranean disease and later bou-tonneuse fever by Connor who described this condition for the first time in 1910. Megaw in 1917 first described this disease in the foothills of Himalaya in India. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology, culture, biochemical reactions, and other properties of R. rickettsiae are similar to those of other rick- ettsial pathogens. They are small intracellular bacteria, which multiply in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. They stain poorly with Gram stain, but stain well with Giemsa or Gimenez stain. Pathogenesis and Immunity R. rickettsiae like other rickettsiae multiply within the endo-thelial cells of the small blood vessels and invade the blood streams. Subsequently, they cause vasculitis and vascular lesions, which are found in almost all organs but are com-monly found in the skin and in the adrenal glands, liver, heart, and CNS. The condition progresses to hypoalbunemia, hyponatremia, and hypovolemia due to loss of plasma into the tissues. Chap-48.indd 411 5/14/2012 12:16:34 PMSection III Chapter 48412 BACTERIOLOGY Clinical Syndrome R. rickettsiae cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Rocky mountain spotted fever Incubation period is 7 days. The condition is characterized by development of fever, severe headache, chills, and myalgia. A rash may develop after three or more days and typically appears initially on wrist, ankles, and palms and soles and then spreads to the trunk. The rash is maculopapular early in the disease but may later become petechial and hemorrhagic. This is a serious disease associated with many complica- tions, such as respiratory failure, encephalitis, and renal fail-ure. The patient may die within 5 days of onset of symptoms. The overall mortality rate is nearly 4% despite effective anti-biotic therapy. The deficiency of enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is usually associated with more severity of infection. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Rocky Mountain spotted fever is distributed in southern Canada, Central America, Mexico, and parts of South America. R. rickettsiae, causing the condition, is the most common rick-ettsial pathogen in the United States. Habitat R. rickettsiae is an intracellular pathogen of endothelial cells and blood vessels of humans. The bacteria are also found in ticks. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Ticks are the natural hosts, reservoirs, and vectors of R. rickettsiae. Different tick hosts are associated with the infection in different parts of the world. These vectors include the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni ) in the western United States and western Canada, the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis ) in the eastern Canada and eastern United States, and Lone star tick ( Amblyomma americana) in the southwestern United States. Rickettsia multiplies in these ticks and is transmitted transovarially to the next gen-eration (Fig. 48-2). R. rickettsiae is transmitted to humans through saliva during the bite by a tick. It usually takes 6 hours of attachment and feeding before rickettsiae are transmitted to the host. Infection can also be transmitted occasionally by scratching and rubbing infectious tick feces into the abraded skin. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include skin biopsy for antigen detection and serum for serodiagnosis. Culture R. rickettsiae can be isolated in embryonated egg or tissue cul-tures, but cultures are rarely attempted because of associated risk of infection. Direct detection of rickettsial antigen Direct detection of R. rickettsiae in skin biopsy specimens of the rash from infected patients by direct fluorescent antibody test using the specific antirickettsial antibodies is a rapid and specific method for confirming diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. This test is recommended for its use prior to therapy or within the first 48 hours after the antibiotic therapy. Serodiagnosis Definite diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is made by employing serological tests that detect R. rickettsiae immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. IFA and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are new serological tests that are used for early diagnosis of the condition. The IFA is most commonly used test. This test uses group- specific heat-labile proteins and the LPS antigens of scrub typhus group. Therefore, the test is not species specific. The IFA is 95-100% sensitive and 100% specific. Demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute and convales-cent sera or demonstration of antibody titre of 1:64 or more in a single serum is diagnostic of the disease. These antibod-ies are detected in the serum 2-3 weeks after the onset of the disease and remain in the serum after a very long period of time. Tick Tick biteEpidemic or tick borne Larva FIG. 48-2. Transmission of tick-borne Diagnosis PCR has been used to detect R. rickettsiae DNA in the skin biopsy specimens of the rash with good sensitivity and high specificity. Treatment Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin are effective against R. rickettsiae. Prevention and Control The use of protective clothing and insect repellents and avoid-ance of tick-infested areas are preventive measures against R. rickettsiae infection. No vaccine is available against the Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Other Rickettsial Species in theSpotted Fever Group Six other rickettsial species in the spotted fever group have been associated with human disease. These include tick-borne dis-eases, such as boutonneuse fever caused by R. conori, Australian tick typhus caused by Rickettsia australis, and Siberian tick typhus caused by Rickettsia siberica. All these rickettsial patho- gens are maintained in wild animals and ixodid ticks. Humans are the accidental hosts. The clinical diseases produced by these rickettsiae are similar to the Rocky Mountain spotted fever but are relatively milder. Rickettsia akari Rickettsial pox caused by R. akari is prevalent worldwide. It has been reported from Russia, South Africa, and Korea. Common house mouse (Mus musculus) is the natural reservoir. R. akari is transmitted from mouse to mouse by the bite of the mouse mite (Liponyssoides sanguineus). The infection in the mite is trans-mitted to the progeny transovarially (Fig. 48-3). The incubation period is 7 days. The condition manifests by development of papule at the site of the bite by the mite. Subsequently, the papule progresses to an ulcer and then it leads to the formation of eschar. This is followed by develop-ment of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia in 3-10 days. A generalized papular vesicular rash usually appears 3-4 days after the emergence of fever. The illness lasts for a short dura-tion of 10-14 days, after which recovery occurs. Complete heal-ing of rash occurs within 2-3 weeks without treatment. The rickettsial pox is clinically is a mild form of infection. Like other rickettsial infections, diagnosis of the condition is clinically supported by serology. This disease is differentiated from other rickettsial infections by: The presence of an eschar at the site of bite of mouse mite, The presence of a vesicular pustular eruption, and A negative Weil-Felix reaction. Rodents are the natural host of the mite transmitting rickettsial pox in different parts of the world. Treatment with doxycycline or chloramphenicol is highly effective for rickettsial pox infections. The epidemiology of rickettsial species causing human diseases is summarized in Table 48-4. Genus Orientia Genus Orientia contains tsutsugamushi formerly known as R. tsutsugamushi, is the causative agent of scrub typhus. The condition is transmitted to humans by the mite Leptotrombidium akamushi and also pos- sibly by Leptotrombidium deliense . Four stages of development usually take place in the life cycle of the mite. Of these stages, only larval stage (chigger) is infectious to humans and other mammals because these stages require blood meal for further development. O. tsutsugamushi shows a remarkable antigenic heterogene- ity. Three major serotypes are recognized. These are Kart, Gili, and Kata types. The organism is transmitted to humans by chiggers that live and reproduce in the soil and in the scrub vegetation. Rickettsial pox R. akari Caused by the bite of a mite that has a small rodent reservoir Eschar (thick crust) at site of bite, and papulovesicular rashRocky Mountain spotted fever R. rickettsii Maintained in wood and dog tick population Causes high fever, malaise, and prominent rash Complication (if untreated): Vascular disturbances Myocardial failure Renal failure FIG. 48-3. Comparison of rickettsial pox and Rocky Mountain spotted 413 5/14/2012 12:16:34 PMSection III Chapter 48414 is restricted in its geographical distribu- tion. The condition is present in the western Pacific regions, Australia, and Eastern Asia. Once the mice are infected, they act as reservoir of O. tsutsugamushi. Rats, mice, and larger mam-mals are the usual hosts. Humans are the accidental hosts. The mites feed on the blood of animals only once during the cycle of development, hence are not believed to be an impor-tant reservoir for human diseases. The infection is transmit-ted from rats to the progeny by transovarial transmission. Scrub typhus is a mild and self-limiting disease, but if untreated it has a fatality of 7%. The incubation period on an average varies from 10 to 12 days. The condition manifests with severe headache, fever, myalgia, and rash. The maculopapular rash develops initially on the trunk and later on the limbs, and is present in nearly 50% of the patients. In untreated patients, fever disappears after 2-3 weeks. Splenomegaly, CNS complica-tions, generalized lymphadenopathy, and heart failure are the complications of this condition. Tetracyclines, doxycycline, or chloramphenicol are highly effective in treatment of scrub typhus. An effective vaccine is not available. Use of insect repellants and wearing protective clothings to avoid exposure to chiggers prevent the disease. Genus The bacteria multiply in the cytoplasm of infected phagocytic cell as mulberry-like clusters called morula. The genus Ehrlichia consists of three species that cause infec-tions in human. These are (a) Ehrlichia sennetsu granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The genus Ehrlichia is named after the scientist Paul Ehrlich. The first case of Ehrlichia infection in humans was reported in Japan in 1954. The cases resembled glandular fever with the serum positive for antibodies against the agents of canine ehrlichiosis. The causative agent isolated from the cases was named E. sennetsu. Sennetsu is a Japanese word, meaning glandular fever.Properties of the Bacteria Ehrlichia are small intracellular bacteria. They stain poorly with Gram stain, but stain well with Giemsa or Gimenez stain. They multiply in phagosomes of infected cells. Culture and other characteristics are same as described for rickettsia. Pathogenesis and Immunity Ehrlichia are intracellular pathogens. Intracellular location of these pathogens protects them from immune response of the host. Inside the cell, they are able to prevent fusion of phago-some with lysosome of monocytes or granulocytes, hence are not lysed by the host's antibody response. Clinical Syndromes Ehrlichia species cause three clinical ( a) sennetsu locytic Sennetsu fever Sennetsu fever is caused by E. sennetsu. The condition presents typically as an acute febrile illness and resembles glandular fever. Cervical lymphadenopathy, atypical lymphocytosis, and increase in number of peripheral mononuclear cells are the typical manifestations of the disease. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis This condition is caused by E. chaffeensis, which infects mostly monocytes. Human diseases are associated with headache, malaise, and myalgia after 1-3 weeks of tick bite. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes are other mani-festations. Rash is found in only 20% of the patients. Mortality due to condition is less than 5% and is seen primarily in patients with immunocompromised status and also in elderly patients. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis This condition is caused by E. phagocytophila as well as Ehrlichia ewingii, which infect mostly granulocytes. This condition is characterized by a febrile illness having similar manifestations to that of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. The condition is asso-ciated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia similar to that in human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Sennetsu fever is a tick-borne disease restricted to Japan. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is distributed mainly in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and south-central parts of the United States. There are areas in which lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) are found in large numbers. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is distributed in the Northeast and Species Vector Reservoir Disease Rickettsia prowazekiiLouse Humans Epidemic typhus and Brill- Zinsser disease flea Rat Endemic Queensland typhusTABLE 48-4Epidemiology Chapter 48RICKETTSIA, ORIENTIA, EHRLICHIA, AND COXIELLA 415 Central Atlantic states and in midwestern states of the United States and also in the Europe. Habitat Like other rickettsia, Ehrlichia is found as obligate intracellular parasite in infected hosts. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Ehrlichiosis are tick-borne diseases. Ticks are the vectors for all Ehrlichia species causing diseases in humans and ani- mals. White tick deer and domestic dogs are reservoirs for E. chaffeensis, and the bacteria are transmitted by the lone star tick (A. americanum). Dogs are the vectors for E. ewingii. The lone star tick also transmits the infection. Small mammals, such as white-footed mouse, chipmunks, and whorls are the reservoirs for E. capillaris, Ixodes are the vectors for the pathogen. Reservoirs are not known for sennetsu fever. It is an exception, which is transmitted by ingestion of raw fish infected with flukes but not by ticks. The epidemiology of Ehrlichia species causing human diseases is summarized in Table 48-5. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstration of the patho-gen by microscopy and isolation by culture. Microscopy Human ehrlichiosis may be diagnosed by microscopy. Giemsa-stained smear of blood films shows morulae, the intracellular form of the bacteria and is the diagnostic of the disease. However, this method has low sensitivity. Morulae are detected only in less than 10% of patients with human monocytic ehrlichiosis and in 20-80% of patients with human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Culture Isolation of Ehrlichia by culture is frequently used for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis. Serodiagnosis The IFA is used to demonstrate specific antibodies in the serum by using Ehrlichia antigen prepared from the cell culture. The limitations of serological tests are that they cannot differenti-ate between E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis infections because they are antigenically closely related. Molecular Diagnosis Molecular methods, such as DNA probes and PCR are used for specific diagnosis of E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis infections. Treatment Doxycycline is the drug of choice for treatment of human ehrlichiosis. Chloramphenicol and fluoroquinolones are not that effective. Prevention and Control Use of insect repellants, wearing protective clothings, etc., are the preventive measures against bites by ticks. Effective vaccine is not available. Genus Coxiella The genus Coxiella was originally classified with rickettsia because the bacteria showed features of a rickettsial pathogen. Like rick-ettsiae they (a ) stain poorly with Gram staining, (b ) multiply intracellularly in eukaryotic cells, and ( c) are transmitted by arthro- pods. Coxiella differs from rickettsiae by the following features: 1. They are not transmitted by arthropod vectors but are transmitted by inhalation or ingestion. 2. They show relatively more resistance to actions of dry heat. The genus Coxiella now has been separated from rick ettsiae and is placed in the group Protobacteria along with other genera, such as Legionella and Francisella. This is because Coxiella was found to be more closely related to these two genera. The genus Coxiella includes the species C. burnetii, which causes Q fever. Species Vector Reservoir Disease Ehrlichia sennetsu No tick vector; ingestion of raw fish infected with flukesUnknown Sennetsu fever Ehrlichia chaffeensis Lone star tick White domestic Monocytic ehrlichiosis Ehrlichia causative agent of Q fever, a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to humans. Q fever was first studied in an experimental infection of guinea pigs by inoculation of blood from patients suffering from typhus-like fever to guinea pigs by Derrick in 1935. As the etiological agent of the disease was not known, the condition was referred to as query or Q fever. Subsequently, Burnett identified the causative agent as a rickettsial, after which the pathogen was named as Rickettsia burnetii. Cox in the United States demonstrated the agent in ticks and named it Rickettsia diaphorica. Later, both the rickett-sial strains were shown to be identical. The organism is now named as C. burnetii and reclassified in the group Protobacteria. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. burnetii shows following features: C. burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium. It is pleomorphic and measures 1 /H11003 0.3 /H9262m in size. The bacterium is Gram negative, but stains poorly with Gram staining. These bacteria like other rickettsiae stain best with Giemsa or Gimenez stains. Culture C. burnetii primarily infects the monocytic macrophage cell. It multiplies in phagolysosomes of the infected cell. It grows well in various cell lines and in the yolk sac. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Coxiella are most resistant pathogens to heat and dryness. They are not completely killed at 60/H11034C or by 1% phenol in 60 minutes. Hence, pasteurization by holding method is not effective method for killing C. burnetii, but the flash method is effective. The bacte- ria survive for a month in meat and for a year or more in dried feces at 4/H11034C. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Characteristically, Coxiella exists antigenically in two forms: (a) phase 1 antigen and (b) phase 2 antigen.Phase 1 antigen: It is a cell wall LPS antigen with a complex carbohydrate structure. This antigen usually prevents inter-action of antibodies with surface protein. Coxiella in phase 1 antigen is highly infectious. Phase 1 is highly immunogenic and elicits a strong antibody response to both 1 and 2 antigens.Phase 2 antigen: This occurs by following repeated passage in yolk sac in which the LPS is modified by exposing the surface proteins to antibodies. In this phase, the surface proteins act with host antibodies. Coxiella occurring in phase 2 is a less infective form of the bacterium.C. burnetii either in phase 1 or phase 2 do not show any antigenic sharing with rickettsia or Proteus bacillus antigen. Therefore, Weil-Felix test is not useful for detection of C. burnetii infection. The antibodies in serum of Q fever do not react with Proteus antigens used in the Weil-Felix test. Acute stage of Q fever is characterized by the presence of antibody titers against phase 2 antigen, whereas chronic dis-ease is characterized by presence of antibodies against both phase 1 and phase 2 antigens. These high titers of antibodies appear to be responsible for pathological changes in various organs during the disease. The cell-mediated immunity is asso-ciated with recovery from the clinical illness. Pathogenesis and Immunity C. burnetii causes infection by penetrating through abraded skin, mucosa, lung, or intestinal tract. They typically grow and multiply in acidic environment of fused phagosome and lysosome. Phase 1 form of C. burnetii is protected from the action of antibodies. Coxiella affects lungs and heart valves and has also been found in macrophages in the lungs and in vegetations of heart valves. The bacteria also cause granulomatous changes in retic-uloendothelial organs, such as liver, spleen, etc. Host-mediated pathogenic mechanisms are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Q fever. Clinical Syndrome C. burnetii causes Q fever, which can occur in acute or chronic forms. Q fever Incubation period is 20 days. The acute stage of Q fever mani-fests as sudden onset of severe headache, high fever, chills, and myalgia. The bacteria produce a respiratory infection mimicking the atypical pneumonia. They also cause hepatosplenomegaly, which is found in approximately half of the patients. The chronic form of Q fever has a long incubation period varying from months to years. Onset of the disease is usually insidious. Subacute endocarditis on a previously damaged heart valve or a prosthetic heart valve is the most common manifestation of the condition. Hepatitis and meningoenceph-alitis are the other manifestations of the disease. Uncomplicated acute disease is a self-limiting disease, which lasts for 1-2 years. Complications in chronic diseases may increase mortality rate to as high as 30-60%. Epidemiology Q fever like other human rickettsial infection is a zoonotic dis-ease transmitted from infected animals to humans. Geographical distribution C. burnetii infection is common in domestic livestock in many parts of the world. C. burnetii infection in birds and animals has been documented by serological studies. Sporadic cases of human infections have been reported. Chap-48.indd 416 5/14/2012 12:16:34 PMSection III C. burnetii are intracellular pathogens in infected livestock and also in humans. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Q fever is a zoonosis distributed worldwide. Farm animals, such as sheep, cattle, and goats as well as cats, dogs, and rabbits are primary reservoirs of infection. Ixodid ticks are responsible for transmitting the disease to rodents and domestic animals and for maintaining infection in these animals. C. burnetii infection in ticks is transmitted transovarially to progeny. Coxiella are excreted in the feces and survive in dried feces over a long period of time. In infected animals, Coxiella are excreted in the milk and particularly in their prod- ucts of conception during parturition of these animals. These bacteria contaminate surroundings of the animals, where they remain as potential source of infection to humans for months. Key Points Ticks do not play any role in the transmission of Q fever from infected animals to humans. Humans acquire diseases by inhalation of infected aerosols. They also possibly acquire the disease from consumption of milk infected with C. burnetii. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Laboratory Diagnosis C. burnetii can be diagnosed by isolation of the bacteria from clinical specimens in guinea pigs, mice, and developing chick embryo. But isolation of the bacteria by these methods is not attempted, because these procedures are biohazardous and are also not required. Serodiagnosis Serology is the mainstay of diagnosis of Q fever. Serological tests include immunofluorescence test, complement fixation test, and ELISA. All these tests detect IgM or IgG antibodies by using phase 1 and 2 antigens. Serodiagnosis of acute Q fever is made by demonstration of (a ) IgG titer of 1:200 or more, or IgM titer of 1:50 or more in a single serum specimen, or (b ) a fourfold rise of antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. The IgG antibodies are present in serum for more than 1 year in 90% of patients, whereas IgM antibodies are present only for 2 weeks and become negative after 2 weeks. Serodiagnosis of chronic Q fever is made by demon- stration of high antibody titer against phase 1 and 2 anti-gens. Antibodies against phase 1 antigen are always higher. Weil-Felix test is not used for diagnosis of Q fever. Molecular Diagnosis PCR is currently evaluated to detect C. burnetii in clinical specimens; however, it still remains to be a research tool and is not widely used in the diagnosis. Treatment Treatment with tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, is effective for acute Q fever. A combination of a tetracycline and cotri-moxazole or rifampicin for a prolonged period is essential for treatment of subacute endocarditis and other chronic diseases caused by C. burnetii. Prevention and Control Preventive measures for Q fever include: Wearing protective clothing (mask, gloves) while handling carcasses and animal hides, Pasteurization of milk by flash method instead of holder method, and Isolation of facilities for parturition of animals. A 30-year-old farmer from Himachal Pradesh attended the Medicine OPD with symptoms of fever, headache, and appearance of rashes over surface of the body. He gave the history that the rash appeared on fifth day of the fever, which first appeared on trunk and then spread to the extremities. On examination, the rashes were found to be maculopapular. These rashes were not found on the face, palm, and sole. Serum was sent for febrile agglutination tests. Widal and stan-dard agglutination test for brucellosis were negative. Paul-Bunnell test was also negative. ELISA for HIV was also negative. Weil-Felix test showed agglutination with OX19 and OX2 but not with OXK. What is the most probable diagnosis? What are the other tests that can be carried out to diagnose the condition? How will you treat the condition? Is this condition found in India?CASE STUDY Chap-48.indd 417 12:16:34 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 49 Introduction The taxonomy of Chlamydia has undergone extensive revision recently on the basis of genomic studies of this microorgan-ism. Chlamydia is included in the order Chlamydiales, which contains one family Chlamydiaceae. Previously, the family con-sisted of a single genus Chlamydia been reclassified into two genera: Chlamydia and Chlamydophila. The species C. trachomatis is included in the genus Chlamydia, whereas C. psittaci and C. pneu-moniae are included in the new genus Chlamydophila. In addi- tion, there are other species that are uncommon human pathogens, which have been placed in either of the two genera. Chlamydia Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular parasites of humans and animals with marked affinity for the squamous epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Species causing human infections are summarized in Table 49-1. The chlamydiae were once considered viruses due to their filterability through 0.45 /H9262m filter and due to their failure to grow in cell-free media. Earlier they were named Psittacosis lymphogranuloma trachoma (PLT) viruses or PLT agents. However, the Chlamydia shows the following properties of bacteria by which they differ from viruses: 1. They contain both DNA and RNA. 2. They possess cell wall as that of Gram-negative bacteria. 3. They contain prokaryotic by Chlamydia species 4. They multiply by binary fission. 5. They produce and synthesize their own nucleic acid, lipids, and proteins. 6. They are suscep tible to a wide range of antibiotics, such as tetracy clines, erythromycin, macrolides, and rifampicin. General Properties The chlamydiae morphologically distinct forms: elementary body and reticulate body.Elementary body: The elementary body (EB) is a small, extracellular, infective form. It is a round particle measuring 300-400 nm in size. The cell wall possesses a rigid trilaminar structure as seen in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria lack peptidoglycan layer found in other bacteria. However, their outer membrane proteins due to the presence of extensive cross-linked protein of the outer membrane confer rigidity to the cell wall. The chlamydiae do not multiply in the EB form, but are infectious. They cause infections by binding to receptors on the epithelial cells and stimulate uptake of the bacteria by infiltration.Reticulate body: The reticulate body (RB) is a large, nonin-fectious form of Chlamydia. It measures 500-1000 nm in size. It is metabolically active and replicating form of Chlamydia. The extensive cross-linked proteins that confer rigidity are absent in the RBs. Hence, this form of Chlamydia is osmotically fragile and friable. This form, however, is protected by its intracellular location. A genus-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is present in the cell wall of Chlamydia. This LPS can be detected by a comple-ment fixation test (CFT) and species-specific and strain- specific outer membrane protein. Growth and Multiplication The Chlamydia multiplies by a characteristic growth cycle that takes place within susceptible host cells (Fig. 49-1). Elementary bodies are the infective form, which initiate the cycle. The infec-tion is initiated by the attachment of the EB to the microvilli of susceptible epithelial cells followed by penetration into the host cell. Inside the host cells, EB remains within the cytoplas-mic phagosomes in which EBs begin to multiply. The fusion of EB containing phagosome with cell wall lysosome is prevented; thus intracellular killing of EB is inhibited. This phagolyso-somal fusion is usually prevented in the host cells with the intact outer membrane. Chap-49.indd 418 5/14/2012 12:16:00 PMSection III Chapter 49CHLAMYDIA AND CHLAMYDOPHILA 419 Within 6-8 hours after entering the cell, the EBs within the phagosome are transformed to large, metabolically active RBs. These RBs synthesize their own proteins and nucleic acids but lack the ability to produce their own high-energy phosphate compound. The chlamydiae are called energy par-asites because of this deficiency. Some strains of Chlamydia also depend on the host for the requirement of their amino acid. The RBs multiply by binary fission, which continues for next 18-24 hours. The developing phagosome with accumulated reticulated bodies within the host cell is called the inclusion body. The mature inclusion body contains nearly 100-500 EBs, which can be readily demonstrated by various staining proce-dures. Ultimately, the host cell ruptures, releasing the EBs. In C. trachomatis infection, the release of EBs occurs within 70-96 hours. The release of the host cell is marked by the presence of a scar. The release of EBs in C. psittaci infection occurs within 48 hours by lysis of the host cell leading to severe damage of the infected host cell.Chlamydiae during the active growth express the Chlamydia- specific LPSs on the cell surface of the infected host cell. These LPSs expressed on the outer surface of the cell are highly anti-genic and induce immunological and inflammatory responses. The properties that differentiate the three Chlamydia spe- cies are summarized in Table 49-2. These species differ in their (a) growth characteristics, (b) antigens, (c) nucleic acid profile, (d) plasmids, and (e) nature of the inclusion body. Chlamydia trachomatis C. trachomatis is a strict human pathogen. Properties of the Bacteria Morphology C. trachomatis are Gram-negative bacteria. However, they can be stained better by Giemsa, Castaneda, Machiavello, or 1 2 46Attachment ReleaseEntry 3 Differentiation to RB5 Differentiation to RBs Multiplication to RBsEB progeny spread to adjacent cellParasite specific endocytosisEB attaches to specific receptor on host cell 9-10 hours 20 hours FIG. 49-1.

EB is an extracellular infectious particle. It is small and spher- ical and measures 800-1200 nm in diameter. These inclusion bodies in the infected cells, such as conjunctiva, urethra, and corneal smears can be demonstrated after staining with Giemsa, Castaneda, or Machiavello methods. These inclusion bodies are large-sized particles, which can be easily demonstrated under light microscope. These bodies consist of glycogen matrix, hence are demonstrated on staining with Lugol's iodine. Reticulate body is metabolically active and replicating form of Chlamydia. Culture C. trachomatis grows better in various tissue cultures, using nonreplicating stationary-phase cells. The bacteria can grow in a few cell lines, such as HeLa-229, McCoy, BHK-21, and buffalo green monkey kidney cells. McCoy and HeLa cells are frequently used for the isolation of the bacteria. C. trachomatis can be grown by inoculation into embryo- nated eggs and also by experimented infection in animals, such as mice. Chlamydia spp. grow in yolk sac of 6-8 days old chick embryo. The growth of chlamydia is demonstrated by the pres-ence of elementary and inclusion bodies as well as group-spe-cific complement-fixing antigen in the yolk sac. C. trachomatis strains differ in their infectivity (L1, L2, and L3) and cause infection in mice when injected intracellularly. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents: Chlamydiae are heat-labile bacteria and are readily killed within minutes by heating at 56 \u00b0C. They are susceptible to ethanol, ether, phenol, formalin, iodine, potassium permanganate, sodium hypochlorite, silver nitrite, and chlorite. They remain fully viable for several days at 4\u00b0C. Moreover, they can be preserved at /H1100270\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen for a long period. Cell Wall Components and Antigenic Structure Chlamydiae possess three types of major antigens: (a) antigens, (b) species-specific antigens, and This is a heat-stable, complement-fixing, and genus-specific antigen. It is an LPS-protein complex resembling the LPS of Gram-negative bacilli. It is present in EBs and RBs. The antigen can be extracted by ether, chloroform, or methanol. The anti-gen is identified by CFT. Species-specific antigen This antigen is present at the envelope surface and is species specific. This antigen is present in all the strains of Chlamydia. Serotype-specific antigen This antigen is present only in a few species of chlamydiae. They are located in the major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) and are useful for intraspecies typing of Chlamydia species. Typing of species On the basis of these antigens, Chlamydia species are classi- fied into various serovars and serologic variants. C. trachomatis has been subdivided into three biological variants known as biovars: (a) trachoma nitis. These biovars on the basis of antigenic differences in the MOMPs have been further classified into 20 serotypes. The trachoma biovar consists of 13 serotypes (A, B, Ba, C, D, Da, E, F, G, H, I, Ia, J, Ja and K). The LGV biovar consists of only five serotypes (L1, trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes diseases of many systems in humans. Virulence factors The ability to multiply intracellularly in the infected cell is the key mechanism of virulence of C. trachomatis. The bacteria pre-vent fusion of phagolysosome with cellular liposomes, thereby preventing intracellular killing of the bacteria by the host cell. Repeated infections caused by C. trachomatis contribute to pathology seen in the infected eye in trachoma. Pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infection C. trachomatis causes disease mainly by ( a) direct destruction of infected host cells during multiplication and (b ) inducing inflammatory responses in the host. C. trachomatis enters the host through minute abrasions or injuries in the skin. The bacteria react specifically with the receptors that are found on the non-ciliated columnar, cuboidal, or transitional epithelial cells. These epithelial cells are typically found on the mucous membranes of the conjunctiva and genitourinary system, such as urethra, endocervix, endometrium, fallopian tract. The mononuclear phagocytes found in the lymphatic system. The pathological lesions are typically found in the lymph nodes draining the site of pri-mary infection. Granuloma is characteristic pathological lesion. Subsequently inflammatory process spreads to other surrounding tissues and finally rupture of the lymph nodes leads to the formation of abscess or sinus tracts. Infections with trachoma serovars are associated with severe inflammatory reaction consisting of neutrophils, lympho cytes, and plasma cells as seen in case of trachoma. Host immunity Infections with C. trachomatis do not induce any long- lasting immunity. Instead reinfection by C. trachomatis typically Chap-49.indd Chapter 49CHLAMYDIA AND CHLAMYDOPHILA 421 produces a strong inflammatory response with severe tissue damage. Such responses are responsible for causing loss of vision in patients with chronic ocular infections and sterility and sexual dysfunction in patients with genital infections. Clinical Syndromes C. trachomatis causes a variety of diseases. It is an important cause of genital and ocular infections worldwide. C. inclusion conjunctivitis, (c) neonatal conjunctivitis, (d) infant most commonly responsible for the condition. LGV is a sexually transmitted disease that affects the cervix, urethra, salpin-ges, and epididymis. Incubation period varies from 1 to 4 weeks. Key Points A small painless papule or ulcerative lesion is the primary lesion, which appears on the external genitalia in patients with LGV. Penis in male, fourchette in females, and rectum in homo-sexuals are the common sites of infection. Occasionally, primary lesions may be found on the extragenital sites (e.g., fingers and palms). The absence of pain in ulcers is the typical manifestation, which differentiates the ulcers from the painful ulcers found in herpes simplex virus infection and syphilis. Fever, headache, and myalgia are the other associated symp-toms. Inflammation and swelling of the lymph nodes draining the primary site of infection is the next stage of the disease. The regional lymph nodes, such as inguinal lymph nodes in males and intrapelvic and pararectal lymph nodes in females, are most commonly involved. These lymph nodes become painful, enlarged, fluctuant, and finally may rupture with the forma-tion of draining fistulas. Such lymph nodes are called buboes. Fever, chills, anorexia, headache, and myalgia are the other associated manifestations. Proctitis is a common manifestation in women with LGV (Color Photo 52). This occurs due to lymphatic spread of the bacteria from the infected cervix or the vagina. Proctitis also occurs in men, resulting from lymphatic spread from the urethra or following anal intercourse. In untreated cases of LGV, the infection may progress to a chronic ulcerative stage leading to development of ulcers, strictures, fistula, or genital elephantiasis. In some other cases, the infection may resolve at this stage. Ocular LGV C. trachomatis conjunctivitis. It is a condition char-acterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva associated with periauricular, submandibular, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Trachoma Trachoma is a communicable disease of the eye caused by C. trachomatis serotypes A, B, Ba, and C. This is a condition characterized by follicular hypertrophy, papillary hyperplasia, pannus formation, and in late The condi-tion begins in patients with follicular conjunctivitis with diffuse inflammation that affects entire conjunctiva. Subsequently, the condition progresses with the formation of pannus, which indicates invasion of blood vessels of cornea and finally loss of vision. The loss of vision is the most important and serious complication of trachoma. Adult inclusion conjunctivitis Adult inclusion conjunctivitis results from the infection with C. trachomatis strains associated with genital infection (A, B, Ba, and D-K). This infection is more frequently seen in sexually active adults. The condition can also occur in neonates. A uni-ocular and less commonly binocular red eye, ocular marked hyperemia, papillary hypertrophy, and a predominant follicular conjunctivitis are the important manifestations. The condition if untreated progresses to a chronic remittent course, keratitis, and possible iritis. Neonatal conjunctivitis This is the neonatal form of inclusion conjunctivitis. The con-dition develops in infants acquiring the infection from infected birth canal. The infection is usually seen in infants born to pregnant mothers who have chlamydial infections of the cervix. Incubation period varies from 5 to 12 days. Swelling of the infant's eyelid, hyperemia, and purulent discharge characterize the condition. Conjunctival scarring and corneal vasculariza-tion occurs in untreated infections of long duration. Infant pneumonia Infant pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis is seen in infants between 4 and 16 weeks of age. It is one of the most common causes of pneumonia in the newborns. This infection is seen in 60% of neonates born to infected mothers. The incubation period is variable but usually takes 2-3 weeks after birth. The condition is characterized by respiratory symp-toms, such as rhinitis with cough and wheezing. Child is usually afebrile during the disease. Urogenital infections Urogenital infection is the most common infection caused by C. trachomatis. Approximately, 80% of infected females and 50% of infected males are asymptomatic. Genital chlamydiasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease Chap-49.indd 421 5/14/2012 12:16:02 PMSection III Chapter 49422 urethritis), epididymitis, proctitis, and a mucopuru-lent cervicitis, endometritis, and salpingitis. Ascending infection can result in pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, and perinephritis. Chlamydial infection with C. trachomatis; especially serotype C is shown to be at a risk of developing cervical cancer, nearly 6.5 times more than in women without infection. Key Points Reiter's syndrome is a triad of recurrent conjunctivitis, polyarthritis, and urethritis or cervicitis, and is most commonly associated with genital infection caused by C. trachomatis. This condition is seen in both men and women. Approximately, 50-60% of patients with Reiter's syndrome have a genital infec-tion with C. trachomatis at onset of arthritis. EBs have been demonstrated in synovial fluid of patients suffering from arthritis. Epidemiology C. trachomatis is distributed worldwide. Geographical distribution LGV caused by C. trachomatis is highly prevalent in Asia, Africa, and South America. The disease occurs sporadically in Europe, Australia, and North America. LGV is responsible for 10% of genital ulcer disease in developing countries. Genital chlamy-diasis and gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae may often coexist. These two pathogens are the most common causes of epididymitis in sexually active adult men. Trachoma is world-wide in distribution and nearly 500 million people are infected worldwide. The infection is endemic in the Middle East, Africa, Far East, and India. The condition is responsible for blindness in 7-9 million patients. Trachoma is particularly prevalent in these countries because of overcrowding, poor sanitation, and poor personal hygiene. All these factors facilitate transmission of infection. Moreover, C. trachomatis is the common cause of infant pneumonia worldwide. Habitat C. trachomatis is a strict human pathogen. It is found in the conjunctiva and genitourinary tract in an infected host. C. trachomatis also inhabits the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of humans. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the only natural host of C. trachomatis and thus are only significant reservoir of infections. Ocular discharges from infected cases are the common source of eye infection for tra-choma. Occasionally, respiratory discharges and human feces can be a source of infection. Trachoma is transmitted by eye-to-eye contact through (a) droplets, (b ) contaminated hands, and (c ) contaminated clothings. All these methods facilitate transmission of ocu-lar discharges from the eyes of infected children to those of normal children. Trachoma is also transmitted by inoculation of respiratory droplets or by ingestion of food and water con-taminated with human feces. Genital discharges are the source of infection for adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Adult inclusion conjunctivitis is usually transmitted by orogenital contact and also by autoinoculation. Although rare, eye-hand transmis-sion has been reported for adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Inclusion conjunctivitis in the newborns is acquired by the infants born vaginally from mothers who are infected with C. trachomatis. C. trachomatis eye infection occurs in approxi- mately 25% of infants whose mothers' genital tract is infected with C. trachomatis. Infected genital discharge is also the source of infection for pneumonia of the newborn. Pneumonia develops in 10-20% of infants during their birth through an infected birth canal. Chlamydial genital infections are usually caused by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Laboratory Diagnosis Various approaches are there for laboratory diagnosis of chla-mydial infections as mentioned below. The sensitivity of these methods, however, depends on (a) the nature of the disease, (b) site of infection from where the specimen is collected, and (c) the population of the patient examined. Specimens Specimens from urethra, cervix, rectum, oropharynx, and conjunctiva are the frequently collected specimens. In addition, other specimens such as, blood, respiratory secretions, sputum, lung, and other tissues are collected and examined. Pus from bubo is also useful for diagnosis of LGV. Microscopy Laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection is made by micro-scopic examination of various clinical specimens for dem-onstration of chlamydial inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies can be demonstrated in specimens stained by Giemsa, Castaneda, Machiavello, or Gimenez stains. C. trachomatis infec- tions of conjunctiva, urethra, and cervix are diagnosed by demonstration of typical reniform inclusion bodies surround-ing the nucleus in the stained smear of conjunctiva, urethra, and cervical smears. Key Points Iodine staining of conjunctival scrapings is a simple and rapid method for diagnosis of TRIC. Iodine stains the gly-cogen matrix of inclusion bodies of C. trachomatis. However, iodine staining is a method of poor sensitivity and is positive only in certain stages of development of inclusion bodies in infected cells. This is more useful for demonstration of chla-mydial inclusion bodies in the cell cultures inoculated with clinical specimens. Chap-49.indd 422 5/14/2012 12:16:02 PMSection III 49CHLAMYDIA AND CHLAMYDOPHILA 423 Culture Isolation of C. trachomatis in cell cultures is the more spe-cific method for diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection. Clinical specimens are inoculated in different cell lines for isolation of Chlamydia. The sensitivity of the cell cultures for isolation of C. trachomatis is increased by ( a) pretreatment with cycloheximide (i.e., a metabolic inhibitor, which inhibits the metabolism of host cells) and (b ) use of irradiated cell lines (treated McCoy cells are most commonly used cell lines for isolation of C. trachomatis). C. trachomatis infection in cell culture is demonstrated by the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies. These are detected by the use of iodine stains or fluorescence-conjugated antibod-ies. The culture methods are difficult and expensive. These are specifically preferred for isolation of C. trachomatis from rectal specimens, because noncultural methods are usually negative. The culture shows a sensitivity of 50-90% and specificity of 99%. Antigen detection Chlamydial antigen can be detected in clinical specimens by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining and enzyme immu-noassay (EIA). Antibodies prepared against either the Chlamydia MOMP or the cell wall LPS are used to detect antigens in clinical specimens by these two methods. Both DFA staining and EIA are approximately 80% sensitive and 95% specific. Both the methods, however, are labor inten-sive and require trained personnel. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis is based on detection of antibodies against C. trachomatis in serum. Patients with LGV show a very high level of serum antibodies. Antibody-based tests are useful for diagnosis of LGV. CFTs, microimmunofluorescence (MIF), and ELISA are employed to detect specific antibodies in the sera: CFT uses a genus-specific LPS antigen for detection of anti-bodies. A single serum showing a high antibody titer of 1:256 or more, or a fourfold increase in antibody titer of a paired sera sample is highly suggestive of LGV. MIF test is a specific test, which utilizes the species- and serovar-specific antigens, such as Chlamydia MOMPs. Con-firmation of LGV is carried out by the MIF test. ELISA is a genus-specific test that uses LPS antigen like CFT. The antibodies-based serological tests are of limited value in diagnosis of urogenital infections caused by C. trachomatis. This is because antibody titers cannot differentiate between recent and past infection, since antibodies are present in circulation for a long period of time. Detection of IgM antibody by ELISA, however, is very useful for diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumonia in infants. Frei's skin test Frei's test is an intradermal skin test used for the diagnosis of LGV. A heat-inactivated C. trachomatis LGV serovar grown in the yolk sac of embryonated egg is used as antigen and 0.1 mL of anti-gen is injected intradermally in the forearm and a control antigen prepared from uninfected yolk sac is injected in the other forearm.Frei's skin test is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which positive reaction is shown by development of an inflammatory macule, measuring /H11022 7 mm in diameter, on the test arm after 2 days. The nodule reaches maximum size within 4-5 days. The skin test becomes positive 2-6 weeks after infection and remains positive for several years. However, nowadays skin test is rarely used for diagnosis. Molecular Diagnosis Molecular diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection is made by DNA probes and PCR (polymerase chain reaction). DNA probes are currently available, which detect the presence of a species-specific sequence of 16S rRNA. This method is not highly sensitive. PCR is used for diagnosis of infection with a reported sensitivity of 80-90% and specificity of 99%. The method is useful specifically for testing urine specimens, but is less sensitive for detection of the bacteria in genital swabs collected from infected women. Treatment Azithromycin is the drug of choice for treatment of genital chla-mydial infections. This antibiotic has the advantage of being given in a single dose regimen and has high tolerability and few contraindications. Tetracyclines are usually recommended for treatment of patients with LGV for at least 3 weeks. Children below 9 years, pregnant women, and patients unable to tolerate tetracyclines are treated with a macrolide, such as erythromycin or azithromycin in combination with sulfisoxazole. Doxycycline for 7 days or fluoroquinolone (e.g., ofloxacin) for 7 days is also effective for treatment of genital and ocular infections. Erythromycin given for 10-14 days is very useful for treatment of conjunctivitis in infants and infant pneumonia. Erythromycin may be administered orally and topically for treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum. Local application and oral administration of erythromycin and tetracycline given for several weeks are effective for treat-ment of trachoma. Prevention and Control Although it is difficult to prevent C. trachomatis infection, the morbidity (such as, blindness associated with trachoma) can be prevented by immediate treatment at early stage of the disease and by taking measures to prevent re-exposure to the bacteria. Chlamydial genital infections are prevented by using safe sexual practices and by prompt treatment of symptomatic patients and their partners. Chlamydophila C. pneumoniae was first isolated from the conjunctiva of a child in Taiwan in 1965 and subsequently from throat of a patient with pharyngitis in 1983. These organisms were initially believed to be C. psittaci strains TWAR (from Taiwan acute respiratory), Chap-49.indd 423 5/14/2012 12:16:02 PMSection III Chapter 49424 BACTERIOLOGY because they produced inclusion bodies in cell cultures similar to those produced by C. psittaci. Taiwan isolate was designated as TW-183, and the pharyngeal isolate was designated as AR-9. These two strains were initially believed to be related to psittaci strains, but later on were found to be different. These two organ-isms were then classified as Chlamydia pneumoniae but now have been reclassified and finally placed in a new genus Chlamydophila. Chlamydophila pneumoniae C. pneumoniae is the third pneumonia follow-ing Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. It is an important cause of respiratory disease in older children and adults worldwide. C. pneumoniae causes mostly asymptomatic infections. Pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia are the common manifestations of symptomatic cases in severe respiratory tract infection. C. pneumoniae is also a strict human pathogen and does not have any animal reservoir. Infection is transmitted by respira-tory secretions from person to person without any avian or animal host. Approximately, 2-3 lakh cases of C. pneumoniae occur every year, and most of these cases occur in adults. Diagnosis of infection is made by demonstration of C. pneumoniae antigen in specimens by enzyme immunoassay or DFA test. Diagnosis by culture is not done as C. pneumoniae grows poorly in cell cultures. Serodiagnosis is carried out by using CFT, ELISA, or MIF. Antibodies have been demonstrated in sera of more than 50% of people. PCR is also used to detect bacterial genome in the specimen. Tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromy- cin are given for 10-14 days for treatment of C. pneumoniae infection. Control of C. pneumoniae infection is difficult.Chlamydophila psittaci C. psittaci is the causative agent of psittacosis, a disease of parrots and psittacine birds which can be transmitted to humans. The disease was first observed in parrots, hence named psittacosis (Greek word psittakos means parrot). A similar disease of nonpsittacine birds was called ornithosis (Greek word ornithos means bird). Now both the conditions are called psittacosis. Infection in birds may occur as asymptomatic or symp- tomatic. Symptomatic infection may manifest as respiratory infection, diarrhea, and emaciation. In the infected birds, the bacteria are present in the blood, tissue, and feathers and are also excreted in the feces, nasal discharges, aerosols, etc. C. psittaci can be transmitted from birds to humans as well as sheep, cows, and goat. Humans acquire the infection mostly from psittacine birds, such as parrots, parakeets, cockatiels, and macaws. They get infected by inhalation of dried bird drop-pings, urine, or respiratory secretions of these infected birds. Human infections are mostly occupational, and veteri- narians, poultry workers, pet-shop workers, pigeon farmers, etc. are at increased risk for this infection. Person-to-person transmission is rare. Ingestion of poultry birds also does not cause any infection. Laboratory infection is well documented. C. psittaci in humans causes a clinical syndrome, which var- ies from a mild influenza-like illness to a fatal pneumonia. Incubation period varies from 5 to 14 days. Headache, high fever, chills, malaise, and myalgia are the symptoms at the initial stage of the illness. Nonproductive cough, rales, and con-solidation are the respiratory manifestations. The untreated cases may be severe and progress to encephalitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, and even death (Fig. 49-2). Psittacosis caused by C. psittaci Affects lower respiratory tract, causing fever, dry cough, flu- like symptoms, and bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltration There may also be enlargement of liver and spleen Pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, or intestinal pneumoniaCommunity acquired respiratory infection caused by C. pneumoniae FIG. 49-2. Clinical manifestations caused 49CHLAMYDIA AND CHLAMYDOPHILA 425 Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is based mainly on the serological tests. Demonstration of a fourfold rise in antibody titer in the paired acute and convalescent sera by the CFT is suggestive of C. psittaci infection. MIF test is a specific test used to confirm the diagnosis.Levinthal-Cole-Lille (LCL) inclusion bodies: These are demon-strated in mouse brain, yolk sac, cell cultures, and in infected cells including alveolar macrophages from patients suffering from C. psittaci infection. These inclusion bodies are not stained by iodine, and are more diffuse and irregular. They are not inhibited by sulfadiazine or cycloserine. C. psittaci can be grown in cell cultures, such as L cells after 5-10 days of incubation, but is not used routinely. Tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromy- cin are useful for treatment of C. psittaci infection. Infection is prevented by controlling it in birds.

Their small size allows them to pass through filters that are used to retain back bacteria in contaminated fluids. Hence, they were first described as filterable agents. Viruses, like other microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, and parasites), are the infectious agents that are associated with disease in humans. The viruses unlike other infectious agents are obligate intracel-lular parasites, i.e., they absolutely require living host cells in order to multiply. In addition, viruses replicate by assembly of the individual components rather than by binary fission. The viruses show the following features: 1. They are filterable agents. 2. They are obligate intracellular parasites. 3. They contain a single type of nucleic acid, i.e., either DNA or RNA, but no t both. 4. The virion of the virus particle consists of a nucleic acid genome packaged into a protein coat (capsid), which itself is some times enclosed by an envelope of lipid, proteins, and carbohydrates known as envelope. 5. They multiply inside the living cells by using the synthesiz-ing machinery of the host cell. 6. They replicate by the assembly of the individual com-ponents and do not replicate by division, such as binar y fission. 7. They have a few or no enzymes for their own metabo-lism. They always use host cell machiner y to produce their components, such as viral messenger RNA (mRNA), protein, and identical copies of the genome. The differences between bacteria and viruses are summarized in Table 50-1. The viruses affect a wide range of hosts. There are viruses that infect invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, protists, fungi, and even bacteria. In medical microbiology, we are concerned mainly with viruses that infect either humans or bacteria. The viruses that infect bacteria are known as bacteriophages or phages. Morphology of Viruses The extracellular, infectious viral particle is called the virion: It is a complete, fully developed infectious viral particle composed of nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat. The latter protects it from the environment and is a vehicle of transmission from one host to another. The viruses are classified on the basis of differences in structure of these coats. The virion may be enveloped by being surrounded by a mem-brane or may be nonenveloped, without being surrounded by a membrane. The virion may also contain essential or accessory enzymes or other proteins.General Properties of Viruses Character Typical bacteria Rickettsiae Chlamydiae Viruses Intracellular parasite No Yes Yes Yes Cellular organization Yes Yes Yes No Plasma membrane Yes Yes Yes No Replication by binary fission Yes Yes Yes No Growth on inanimate media Yes No No No Pass through bacteriological filters No No Yes Yes Possess both DNA and RNA Yes Yes Yes No ATP-generating metabolism Yes Yes No No Ribosome Yes Yes Yes No Sensitive to antibiotics Yes Yes Yes No Sensitive to interferon No No Yes YesTABLE 50-1 Comparison of bacteria, rickettsiae, chlamydiae, 5/15/2012 10:01:43 AMSection IV Chapter 50430 VIROLOGY Size The clinically important viruses vary widely in their size (Fig. 50-1). They range from as small as 20-nm viruses (picor-naviruses) to as large as 300-nm viruses (poxvirus). Passing the viruses through collodion membrane filter with different pore sizes was the earliest method of determining the size of the virus. Subsequently, ultracentrifugation method was used to determine the size of the viruses by calculating from the rate of sedimentation of virus in the ultracentrifuge. Electron microscopy is the most recent method for determining the size as well as the shape of the virus. Structure and Symmetry of Virus Viral structure The virion consists of a nucleic acid core, the genome, surrounded by a protein coat, the capsid (Fig. 50-2). The capsid together with the enclosed nucleic acid is known as the nucleocapsid. Some viruses are surrounded by envelopes. The capsid The nucleic acid of a virus is surrounded by a protein coat called the capsid. Each capsid is composed of a large number of protein subunits (polypeptides) called capsomeres, which form its morphological units. The polypeptide molecules compos-ing the capsomeres are of a single type in some viruses, while in other viruses several types may be present. The arrangement of capsomeres is characteristic of a particular type of virus. Key Points Functions of capsid Symmetrically arranged polypeptide molecules of capsid form an impenetrable shell around the nucleic acid core. The capsid facilitates entry of viral genome into the host cells by adsorbing readily to cell surfaces. The capsid of the virus protects its nucleic acid from the activity of nuclease enzymes in biological fluids and thereby facilitates attachment of virus to target cells in the host. The structure of the viral capsid is best demonstrated by X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. On the basis of capsid structure, the viruses can be classified into different morpho-logical types as follows:Helical viruses: The helical viruses appear rod-like and may be rigid or flexible. The viral genome is found within hollow cylin-drical capsid that has a helical structure. The examples of heli-cal viruses include rabies virus, Ebola hemorrhagic virus, etc.Polyhedral viruses: The polyhedral viruses appear as many- sided viruses. The viruses consist of capsids in the shape of an icosahedron. It is a regular polyhedron with 20 triangular faces. The capsomere of each face forms an equilateral triangle. Adenovirus is an example of polyhedral virus in the shape of icosahedron.Enveloped viruses: The helical and polyhedral viruses when covered by envelope are called as enveloped helical or enveloped polyhedral viruses, respectively. Influenza virus is an example of enveloped helical virus, and herpes simplex virus is an exam-ple of enveloped polyhedral virus.Complex viruses: Some viruses, such as viruses of bacteria (e.g., bacteriophages), have complicated structures and are called complex viruses. The detailed structure and function of bacteriophages are described in Chapter 54. The envelope In some viruses, the capsid is covered by an envelope, such viruses are called enveloped viruses. All of the negative-stranded RNA viruses are enveloped. The viruses that lack envelope are called nonenveloped or naked viruses. Properties of the envel-oped and naked viruses are summarized in Tables 50-2 and 50-3, respectively.Animal cell (red blood cell - 7 m)Virus (Rhinovirus - 20 nm)Bacterial cell (Escherichia coli 2 \u00d70.5 m) FIG. 50-1.

Chap-50.indd 430 5/15/2012 10:01:46 AMSection IV Chapter 50GENERAL PROPERTIES OF VIRUSES 431 The virion envelope usually consists of lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins. It has a membrane structure similar to cellular membrane of the host cell. The viral envelope does not con-tain any cellular proteins, even though viruses are released from the host cell by an extrusion process that coats the virus with a layer of host cell plasma membrane that becomes the viral envelope. In most cases, the envelope contains proteins that are determined and encoded by viral nucleic acid. The lipid compo-nent of the envelope is usually of host cell origin. Depending on the virus, the envelopes of the viruses may or may not be covered by spikes. The spikes are glycoprotein-like projections on the outer surface of the envelope. Most spikes act as viral attachment protein (VAP). The VAP that binds to red blood cells is called hemagglu-tinin. The ability of certain viruses, such as influenza virus to agglutinate red blood cells is due to the presence of these hemagglutinins. The process is called hemagglutination and it forms the basis of hemagglutination inhibition test used in the viral serology. The VAPs in some viruses perform different functions, such as neuraminidase activity of influenza virus, fusion glyco-protein of paramyxovirus and C3b receptor associated with herpes simplex virus. The structural components of envelope remain biologically active only in aqueous solutions and are readily destroyed by drying or on treatment with acids, detergents, and solvents, such as ether, leading to inactivation of virus. They are rapidly killed in stomach due to sensitivity of enveloped components to gastric acidity. Therefore, most of the enveloped viruses are usually transmitted through body fluids, such as blood, respi-ratory droplets, tissue exudates, etc. Viral symmetry Three types of symmetry are observed depending on the arrangement of the capsid around the nucleic acid core (genome). These are (a) icosahedral (cubical), (b) helical, and (c) complex symmetry.Icosahedral symmetry: Two types of capsomeres constitute the icosahedral capsule. They are the pentagonal capsomeres or the vertices (pentons) and hexagonal capsomeres making up the facets (hexons) (Fig. 50-3). There are always 12 pentons, but the number of hexons varies with the virus group. Each penton has fivefold symmetry (pentamer or pentagon) in the shape of an equilateral triangle. This pentamer symmetry is found in simple viruses, such as the picornaviruses and par-voviruses. In picornaviruses, each pentamer is made up of five protomers, each of which is composed of three subunits of four different proteins. The hexamer symmetry is usually found in large capsid virions, such as herpesviruses and adenoviruses. Hexons are made up of certain structurally distinct capsomeres between the pentons at the vertices. The presence of hexon extends the icosahedral and is called an icosadeltahedral. The adenovirus nucleocapsid has 12 pentons and 240 hexons, nucleocapsid has 12 pentons and 150 hexons sur-rounded by an envelope.

The viruses with helical structure usually appear as rods and their capso-meres self-assemble on the RNA genome into rods extending to the length of the genome. These capsomeres cover and protect the RNA. The tubular nucleocapsid structure may be rigid as in tobacco mosaic virus, but may be pliable and may be coiled on itself in case of some other animal viruses. Helical nucleo-capsids are usually demonstrated within the envelope of most negative-stranded RNA viruses.Complex symmetry: Some viruses may not exhibit either ico-sahedral or helical symmetry but instead may exhibit a complex symmetry. For example, poxvirus shows a complex symmetry. Shape Most of the enveloped viruses are round or pleomorphic with exception of poxvirus and rhabdovirus. Rhabdovirus is a bullet-shaped virus, whereas poxvirus is brick shaped. Viral Nucleic Acid, Proteins, and Lipids Viral nucleic acid The genome of the virus consists of either DNA or RNA but never both (Fig. 50-4). The DNA can be single stranded or dou-ble stranded. Depending on the virus, the DNA can be linear or circular. The RNA can be either positive sense (/H11001) like mRNA or negative sense (/H11002), double stranded (/H11001//H11002), or ambiguous (containing /H11001 and /H11002 regions of RNA attached to it). In some RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus, the RNA genome is in several separate segments, each segment encoding an individual gene. The total amount of nucleic acid may vary from a few thousand nucleotides to as many as 250,000 nucleotides. Viral proteins and lipids Viruses contain proteins, which constitute capsids. The viral protein protects the nucleic acid as well as determines the antigenic specificity of the virus. In addition, the enveloped viruses contain lipids, which are derived from the host cell membrane. Susceptibility to Physical and Chemical Agents Disinfectants The viruses are usually more resistant than bacteria to chemi-cal disinfectants. Most viruses are relatively resistant to phenol. The oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, hypochlorite, and organic iodine compounds, are most active antiviral disinfectants. Formaldehyde and /H9252-propiolactone are also active virucidal agents, which are commonly used for preparation of killed viral vaccines. The chlorination of drinking water is useful for kill- ing most of the common viruses with exception of hepatitis A and polioviruses. These two viruses are relatively resistant to chlorination. Temperature Most of the viruses with few exceptions are highly heat labile. They are inactivated within seconds at 56\u00b0C, within minutes at 37\u00b0C, and within days at 4\u00b0C. The viruses such as influenza, measles, and mumps are very labile and may survive outside the host only for a few hours. Other viruses, such as polio and hepatitis A, are relatively much stable and may survive for many days, weeks, or even months in the environment.

The viruses are stable at low temperature. They can be stored by freezing at /H1100235\u00b0C or /H1100270\u00b0C. Lyophilization or freeze-drying is useful for long-term storage of the viruses. The poliovirus is an exception, as it does not withstand freeze-drying. pH The viruses usually remain viable in a pH range of 5-9, but are sensitive to extremes of acidity and alkalinity. Rhinoviruses are very susceptible to acidic pH, while enteroviruses are highly resistant. Lipid solvents Ether, chloroform, and detergents are active against envel-oped viruses but are not active against nonenveloped, naked viruses. Radiations The viruses are readily inactivated by sunlight, ultraviolet (UV) radiations, and ionizing radiations. Replication of Viruses The replication of viruses in the host cell depends upon the synthesis mechanism of the host cell for manufacture of differ-ent viral components. The genetic information for viral multi-plication is present in the viral nucleic acid. Multiplication of viruses follows the basic pattern of bacteriophage multiplica-tion, but has several important differences (Box 50-1). The multiplication of viruses, both DNA- and RNA- containing viruses, is divided into six phases as follows: (i) attachment, (ii) penetration, (iii) uncoating, (iv) biosynthesis, (v) maturation, and (vi) release (Fig. 50-5).Attachment Attachment or adsorption is the first event in the infection of the cell by a virus. The viruses have attachment sites that attach to the complementary receptor sites on the host cell surface. These receptor proteins in the virus are distributed on surface of the virus. These receptor proteins vary from one virus to another (Table 50-4). For example, in influenza virus these receptor proteins are the spikes present on the surface of the envelope, whereas in adenovirus these receptor proteins are small fibers present at the corner of the icosahedron. The attachment sites of the virus bind specifically to the complementary receptors on the surface of the host (Table 50-5). These receptor sites on the cell vary depending on the nature of the virus: Rabies virus binds specifically to the acetylcholine receptors found on neural cells HIV-1 binds specifically to the CD4, a 60-kDa glycoprotein on the surface of mature T lymphocytes. Influenza virus binds specifically to sialic acid residue of glycoprotein receptor sites on the surface of respiratory epithelium. Susceptibility of the host to virus infection, therefore, depends upon the presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface.

Release of virus.Box 50-1 Steps in viral replication Chap-50.indd 433 5/15/2012 10:01:47 AMSection IV Chapter 50434 VIROLOGY Penetration Depending on their nature, whether enveloped or nonenvel-oped, the viruses penetrate into cell by different mechanisms: A nonenveloped virus enters the cell by a process known as endocytosis. The endocytosis is an active process by which nutrients and other molecules are brought into a cell. This process is also known as viropexis. The enveloped viruses enter the cell by an alternate method called fusion, in which the viral envelope fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the capsid into the cell cyto-plasm. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a classical example of an enveloped virus, which enters the host cell by this method. Uncoating Uncoating is the process of separation of viral nucleic acid from its protein core. This process apparently varies depending on the nature of the virus causing infection: With most viruses, the uncoating is accomplished by the action of lysosomal enzymes present inside the phagocytic vacuoles and Golgi vesicles of the host cell. These lysosomal enzymes degrade the protein of the viral capsid. In some other viruses, uncoating is caused exclusively by enzymes present in the host cell cytoplasm. In case of poxvirus, the uncoating is effected by the action of a specific enzyme encoded by the viral DNA, which is synthesized soon after infection. Biosynthesis The sites of viral synthesis depend on the type of virus, whether RNA virus or DNA virus. Biosynthesis of DNA viruses DNA viruses replicate their DNA in the nucleus of the host cell by using viral enzymes. However, they synthesize their capsid and other proteins in the cytoplasm by using host cell enzymes. Subsequently, the proteins enter into the nucleus and assem-ble with the newly synthesized DNA to form virions, and then these virions are transported along with endoplasmic reticu-lum to the membrane of the host cell for release. Most of the DNA viruses (herpesvirus, papovavirus, adenovirus, and hepad-navirus) synthesize their nucleic acid in the host cell nucleus. Poxvirus is an exception, because all of its components are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Biosynthesis of RNA viruses The RNA viruses multiply in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The major differences among the multiplication process of various RNA viruses lie in how mRNA and viral RNA are produced, as follows: 1. In Reoviruses, the double-stranded RNA is transcribed to mRNA by viral polymerase. 2. Single-stranded RNA viruses are classified into two catego-ries, depending on the method of mRNA transcrip tion. In positive strand (/H11001 strand, positive sense) RNA virus, the viral RNA itself acts as the mRNA. The viral RNA is trans-lated directly into viral proteins in host cell cytoplasm. In the negative strand (/H11002 sense) RNA viruses, the RNA is anti- sense, with polarity opposite to that of mRNA. They pos-sess their own RNA polymerase for transcription of mRNA. 3. The single-stranded RNA genome of Retroviridae shows a unique replication. First, the RNA genome is con verted into an RNA-DNA hybrid by the viral enzyme reverse transcrip-tase (RNA-directed DNA polymerase). The double-stranded DNA is synthesized from the RNA-DNA hybrid, after which it is integrated into the host cell chromosome. Inte-gration of viral DNA into the host cell may lead to transfor-mation of the cell and development of malignancies. Maturation The assembly of the protein capsid is the first step in viral maturation. The capsids of many enveloped viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are enclosed by Virus VAP Adenovirus Fiber protein Epstein-Barr virus gp 350 and gp 220 Human immunodeficiency virus gp 120 Influenza A virus HA Measles virus HA Rabies virus G protein Reovirus Epstein-Barr virus C3d complement receptor CR2 (CD21) in B cell Human immunodeficiency virus CD4 molecule coreceptor in helper T in epithelial epithelial cells Herpes simplex virus Immunoglobulin superfamily protein in many cells Rabies virus Acetylcholine receptor in neuron Influenza A virus Sialic acid in epithelial cells Parvovirus B19 Erythrocyte P antigen in erythroid precursorsTABLE 50-5 Examples receptors in host cells Chap-50.indd 434 5/15/2012 10:01:47 AMSection IV Chapter 50GENERAL PROPERTIES OF VIRUSES 435 envelopes, which consist of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. During maturation, the envelope protein is encoded by the viral genes and is incorporated into the plasma membrane of the infected host cell. In contrast, the envelope lipids and carbohydrates are encoded by host cell genes, but not by viral genes, and are present in the plasma membrane. The envelope develops around the capsid by a process called budding. The assembly of various viral components into virions may take place in the nucleus (e.g., herpesvirus and adenoviruses) or cytoplasm (e.g., picornaviruses and poxviruses). The nonenveloped viruses are present intracellularly as fully developed viruses, but in case of enveloped viruses, only the nucleocapsid is complete. Subsequently, nucleocapsid is surrounded by an envelope, which is derived from the host cell membrane during the process of budding. Release Release of the completed viruses is the last step in the replica-tion of viruses. In case of animal viruses, the release of progeny virions usually occurs without cell lysis. The host cell is unaffected and goes on dividing to the daughter cells, which continue to release virions. Progeny virions are released into the surrounding environment and may affect new host cells. Budding does not immediately kill the host cell and in some cases the host cell survives. Nonenveloped viruses, however, release through rupture in the host cell plasma membrane. This type of release usually results in the death of the host cell. A single infected cell may release a large number of daughter virions. The time taken for a single cycle of replication is about 15-30 hours. In a cycle of replication, the virus cannot be dem-onstrated inside the host cell from the stage of penetration till the appearance of mature daughter virions. This period is known as the eclipse stage. Abnormal Replicative Cycles During replicative cycles of virus, many types of abnormal replicative cycle do occur. These are as follows:Incomplete viruses: Due to defect during assembly of viral components, some of the daughter virions that are produced may not be infective. Example of such incomplete virus is the influenza virus that shows a high hemagglutination titer but with a low infectivity. This is known as von Magnus phenomenon.Pseudovirions: Pseudovirions are the viruses that occasion- ally enclose host cell nucleic acid instead of viral nucleic acid. These, therefore, are noninfective and lack the capability to replicate.Abortive infections: In this type of infection, the virus com- ponents may be synthesized but the maturation is defective. The progeny virions are either not released or are noninfectious. This type of infection occurs due to infection of the wrong host cells by the virus.Defective viruses: Some of the viruses that are genetically defective do not produce fully formed virions. They produce fully mature virions only in the presence of helper viruses which supplement the genetic deficiency in the defective viruses. Hepatitis D virus and adeno-associated satellite viruses are the examples of defective viruses, which replicate only in the pres-ence of helper viruses, such as hepatitis B virus and adenovirus, respectively. Viral Genetics The viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens. They repli-cate only in a living host cell. Viruses, like other living beings, obey the law of genetics. The viruses show variation in their genomic structure by two principal methods\u2014mutations and recombination. Mutation Mutation is the most important mechanism of genetic modification in viruses. Mutations occur spontaneously and readily in viral genomes causing frequent changes in the nucleic acids. This results in production of new viral strains showing properties different from parental or wild-type virus. Mutations occur during every viral infection; the frequency of mutations being about 10 /H110024 to 10/H110015. New variants of strains are identified by their nucleotide sequence, antigenic differences, or by differences in their structural or functional properties. Mutations in the essential genes of virus cause inactivation of the virus. This is known as lethal mutation. However, mutations in the other genes alter antigenicity and pathogenicity of the virus and induce drug resistance in viruses. Mutations in viruses may be induced by mutagens, e.g., irradiation or chemical agents, such as 5-fluorouracil, or even may occur spontaneously. Lethal mutations Mutations in essential genes are known as lethal mutations. Mutations in viruses lead to formation of various mutants, which show new functional or structural proteins. This leads to formation of new viral mutants, which are difficult to iso-late because the virus cannot replicate. Selective removal or loss of a portion of the viral genome and subsequent loss of func-tion that it encodes leads to the formation of deletion mutant.Other mutations may produce: Attenuated emutants\u2014variant strains that cause less seri-ous infections in humans and animals. Host range mutants\u2014variant strains showing differences in the tissue type and species of target cells affected by viruses. Plaque mutants\u2014variant strains showing difference in their size or their appearance in infected host cells. Conditional mutants\u2014e.g., temperature-sensitive or Chapter 50436 VIROLOGY Recombination Genetic recombination may occur when two different but related viruses infect a cell simultaneously. This leads to extramolecular genetic exchange between two viruses, leading to production of a progeny virion that possesses genes from both the viruses. Genetic recombination may occur between (a) two active infectious viruses, (b) one active and another inactive virus, and (c) two inactive viruses. Following types of genetic recombination may occur when a host cell is affected by two viruses: 1. Intramolecular recombination 2. Reassortment 3. Reactivation Intramolecular recombination Intramolecular recombination occurs between two closely related DNA viruses. For example, infection of the host cell by two closely related herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 produces recombinant, new hybrid strains. These new hybrid strains possess genes from both viruses: type 1 and 2. This process has also been observed in closely related RNA viruses. For example, recombination of Sindbis and eastern equine encephalitis virus has led to the formation of western equine encephalitis virus, another togavirus. Reassortment Reassortment is another process of genetic recombination. It occurs between viruses with segmented genomes, such as influenza virus A and B (8 segments), Reoviridae (10-12 segments), Bunyaviridae (3 segments), and Arenaviridae and Birnaviridae (2 segments). An exchange of segments occurs between these viruses, resulting in production of new hybrid strains. Synthesis of new strains of influenza A by coinfection with a virus from different species is an example of genetic recombination by reassortment that occurs in nature. Reactivation It is of two types: (a) cross-reactivation or marker rescue and (b) multiplicity reactivation.Cross-reactivation (marker rescue): This occurs between an active virus and a related inactive virus, resulting in a progeny possessing one or more genetic traits of the inactivated virus. For example, in influenza virus, when a new epidemic strain (e.g., strain A1) that does not often grow well in eggs as compared to the established strain is grown in eggs along with a standard strain (e.g., strain A2) inactivated by UV irradiation, it results in production of a new hybrid strain. The hybrid strain may have antigenic properties of strain A2 but genetic characteristics of A1. Such viruses have been evaluated widely in production of influenza vaccines. Marker rescue is also used to map the genome of herpes simplex virus.Multiplicity reactivation: This is a phenomenon in which live virus may be produced when a cell is infected with two or more (high multiplicity) virus particles of the same virus, each of which has suffered lethal mutation in a different gene due to UV irradiation. Thus from the total genetic pool, it may be possible to obtain a full complement of undamaged genes, resulting in production of infectious virion progeny. Therefore, there is a potential danger of multiplicity reactivation occurring following the administration of UV-irradiated vaccine. So UV irradiation is not a safe method of producing inactivated virus vaccine. Nongenetic Interaction between Viral Gene Products Nongenetic interaction between viral gene products takes place in following four ways: (a) complementation, (b) phenotypic mixing, (c) genotype mixing, and (d) interference. Complementation Complementation is a functional interaction between the gene products of two viruses, when two viruses (one or both of which may be infective) infect a cell simultaneously. In this process, their gene products, such as proteins and enzymes, comple-ment action of each other so as to have increased yield of one or both viruses. This occurs even between unrelated viruses. In this process, a defective virus strain can be rescued by the replication of another mutant or by a wild-type strain. For example, adenovirus is defective in simian cell but it can be rescued by SV40. The SV40 virus can grow in monkey cells and produce a gene product that adenovirus needs, thereby comple-menting replication of adenovirus. Phenotypic mixing In this process, virus products from cells infected with different virus strains may be phenotypically mixed and have the proper-ties of one strain but the genome of other. This is not a stable variation; on subsequent passage, the capsid will be found to be of the original type only. In phenotypic mixing, when the nucleic acid of one virus is surrounded by the entire capsid of the other virus, it is called transcapsidation. Pseudotypes are produced when transcapsidation occurs between different types of viruses, but this is rare.Key Points Temperature-sensitive mutants can grow only at a low tem-perature (28-37\u00b0C). This is due to a mutation in the gene for an essential protein that allows viral replication only at low temperature. These temperature-sensitive mutants are used extensively for the study of viral genetics and are also evalu-ated for possible use in live viral vaccines. Chap-50.indd 436 5/15/2012 10:01:47 AMSection IV Chapter 50GENERAL PROPERTIES OF VIRUSES 437 Genotypic mixing All the viruses of vertebrates are haploid except retroviruses which are diploid; but sometimes several nucleocapsids may be enclosed within a single envelope. This phenomenon of genotypic mixing is known as polyploidy. No recombination between the genomes of the virus takes place, and it is not a stable change. Interference Interference denotes inhibition of growth of one virus in a host cell when it is simultaneously infected with another virus. Interferon is the most important mediator of interfer-ence. Autointerference is another type of interference, in which a high multiplicity of infection inhibits production of infectious progeny. In contrast, mixed infections sometimes increase the yield of one virus and produce well-marked cytopathic effects in the cell lines. This phenomenon is called enhancement. Nomenclature and Taxonomy of Viruses The initial classification of viruses was haphazard and was based on the symptomatology of the disease they caused or on the sites of their isolation. They were classified as (a) pneumo-tropic, those affecting the respiratory tract (e.g., influenza and common cold); (b) neurotrophic, affecting the nervous system (e.g., poliomyelitis and rabies); (c) dermatotropic, affecting the skin (e.g., smallpox and chickenpox); and (d) viscerotropic, affecting visceral organs (e.g., hepatitis, yellow fever). This system of classification was convenient but not scientifically acceptable, because the same virus may cause more than one disease depending on the tissue affected. Since 1966, a systematic classification of viral taxonomy and nomenclature was carried out with the formation of International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Since then, ICTV has been introducing systematic approach for classification and nomenclature of the viruses. The ICTV has been grouping viruses into families based on ( a) type of nucleic acid they possess, (b) means of replication, and (c) morphology (e.g., presence or absence of membrane envelope). The suffix virus is used for genus names, viridae for family names, and ales for order names. In formal usage, the family and genus names are used in the following manner: for example, fam-ily Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, human rabies virus. A viral species is a group of virus that shares the same genetic informa-tion and ecological niche. These viral species are designated by descriptive common names, such as human herpesvirus, with subspecies, if any, designated by a number (e.g., HHV-1). Depending on the type of nucleic acids viruses possess, they are classified into two groups: deoxyriboviruses, which contain DNA (DNA virus) and riboviruses, which contain RNA (RNA virus). DNA viruses associated with human diseases are divided into six families (Table 50-6). The RNA viruses associated with human diseases are classified into at least 13 families (Table 50-7).DNA Viruses These belong to the following families (Table 50-6):Adenoviridae: The members of the family Adenoviridae are medium-sized viruses measuring 20-90 nm in size. These viruses are nonenveloped, icosahedral viruses with 252 cap-someres. They are so named because they were first isolated from adenoids. These viruses are mostly associated with acute respiratory diseases.Poxviridae: These are large-sized, brick-shaped viruses mea- suring 300 /H11003 240 /H11003 100 /H9262 in size. They have a complex structure with a core containing a single linear molecule of double-stranded DNA genome. The pox (pox: pus-filled lesions) viruses are associated with skin lesions. The viral components are syn-thesized and assembled in the cytoplasm of infected host cells.Herpesviridae: These are medium-sized icosahedral nucleo- capsid viruses (100 nm) containing 162 capsomeres. They are enveloped viruses containing linear, double-stranded DNA. They are named after spreading (herpetic) appearance of cold sores. The viruses multiply in the nucleus of the host cells.Papovaviridae: These are small (40-55 nm) viruses con- taining double-stranded DNA with 72 capsomeres. They are nonenveloped viruses. They replicate in the nucleus of host cell along with host cell chromosome. This may cause host cells to proliferate, resulting in a tumor. Papovaviruses are acronyms to papillomas (warts), polyomas (tumors), and vac-uolation viruses).Hepadnaviridae: Hepadnaviridae (hepa: liver; dna: DNA core) are so named because they cause hepatitis and contain DNA as genome. These viruses differ from other DNA viruses by synthe-sizing their DNA by copying RNA using reverse transcriptase. Human hepatitis B virus, an important virus associated with human disease, is included in this family. RNA Viruses These belong to the following families (Table 50-7):Togaviridae: These viruses include arboviruses and alphavi- ruses. Most of these viruses multiply in arthropods as well as in vertebrates. Togaviridae (toga: envelope) are enveloped viruses containing single-stranded RNA genome. These viruses are small spherical viruses nm in size.Rhabdoviridae: Rhabdoviruses (rhabdo: are enveloped, measure 130-300 /H11003 20 nm in size, and contain a are icosahedral, nonenveloped viruses double-layered capsid enclosing 10-12 segments of double-stranded RNA. Their name is derived from the first letters of respiratory, enteric, and orphan. When first discovered, the viruses were not associ-ated with any diseases, hence were called orphan viruses. These viruses are now known to cause respiratory and intestinal infections. Chap-50.indd 437 5/15/2012 10:01:47 transcrip- tase) viruses are so because characteristically they possess the enzyme, reverse transcriptase RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. They are icosahedral, enveloped viruses measuring 100 nm in size. Many of these viruses are asso-ciated with tumors in infected hosts. One of the genera, Lentivirus includes the subspecies HIV-1 and HIV-2, of aquired immunideficiency syndrome (AIDS).Picornaviridae: Picornaviruses small) are the small- est viruses, measuring 20-30 nm in size. They are nonenvel-oped, icosahedral viruses genome. These nm) viruses. They are spherical and elongated, enveloped viruses consisting of single-stranded but segmented (eight segments) RNA genome. Influenza virus is the only virus of medical importance belonging to this group.Paramyxoviridae: These are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses measuring 150 nm in size. They contain nonsegmented, single-stranded, linear RNA. Three genera have been described: ing 90-100 nm in size. Uukuvirus, Phlebovirus, and sizes (50-300 nm). They contain electron-dense, chro-mosome-like particles giving a sandy appearance; hence they are named arenaviruses (arena: sand).Calciviridae: These are naked nonenveloped viruses. They are small and spherical, and measure 35-39 nm in size. They show 32 cup-shaped depressions arranged in symmetry.Filoviridae: They are long filamentous, enveloped viruses with variable sizes. They contain single-stranded RNA genome. The Marburg and Ebola virus are the viruses of medical importance. Prions Prions are infectious particles, which can transmit a disease. These prions are composed chiefly a protein without any detect-able nucleic acid.

The term prion was coined by Prusiner for proteinaceous infectious particles. Unlike conventional viruses, the prions apparently have no virion structure or genomes and evoke no immune response in the infected host. These are extremely resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfectants, and radiation. The prions are causative agents of slow viral infections, such as subacute spongiform encephalopathy. After long incubation period of years, they produce a progressive dis-ease that causes damage to the central nervous system, lead-ing to subacute spongiform encephalopathy. The detailed description of prions and slow virus diseases is provided in Chapter 69.Family Genera (Members) Shape Size (nm) Molecular Paramyxoviridae Respirovirus (Sendai Rubulavirus (mumps virus), stranded, linear, negative sense, and nonsegmented Orthomyxoviridae Influenzavirus A (human influenza A virus), Influenzavirus B (human influenza B virus), and Influenzavirus C (human influenza C virus)Spherical 80-120 5 Single stranded, segmented, linear negative sense. virus) and Lyssavirus 4 Single stranded, nonsegmented negative-sense RNA Filoviridae Filovirus (Ebola virus and Marburg /H11003 80 4 Single stranded Bunyaviridae Orthobunyavirus (California encephalitis virus and La Crosse Retroviridae and hepatitis A virus)Icosahedral 25-30 2.5 Single stranded and positive sense Toga viridae Rubivirus (rubella virus) and alphavirus (Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, and Semliki forest virus)Icosahedral 60-70 4 Single stranded Flaviviridae Flavivirus (yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus), pestivirus, and hepatitis C virus (human hepatitis C virus)Spherical 40-50 4 Single stranded Calciviridae Norovirus (Norwalk virus), lagovirus, and vesivirusIcosahedral 35-40 2.6 Single strandedTABLE Properties of RNA viruses Viroids Viroids are protein-free fragments of single-stranded, circular RNA that cause disease in plants. The term viroids was coined by Triener (1971) to describe a new subclass of subviral agents having a genome very much similar to those of known viruses; they consist of very short pieces of naked RNA: 300-400-nucle-otides long with no protein coat. The RNA does not code for any proteins. The low-molecular-weight RNA is resistant to heat and organic solvents but sensitive to nucleases. So far, viroids have been identified as pathogens of only plants; these were first identified in the potato spindle tuber disease. The viroids are yet to be linked to any disease in humans. Chap-50.indd 439 5/15/2012 10:01:47 AMMycobacterium Leprae43 51 Introduction Viruses cause infection of the host first by breaking the natural protective mechanisms of the body, then evading the immune system of the host, and finally by killing off the host cells and triggering immune and inflammatory responses. The outcome of viral infection depends upon response of the host to infec-tion by a virus and on the nature of the host-virus interaction. Viruses replicate only inside the living cells; hence, the primary pathogenic manifestations are seen at the cellular level. Stages of Viral Infections Viruses initiate infection and may cause disease through many defined stages. These include (a) entry into the body, (b) initia-tion of infection at a primary site (infection of the target tissue), (c) replication of virus (Fig. 51-1) and spread to secondary site, and ( d) manifestations of the disease. Entry into the Body Entry of the viruses into the body is the first step of viral infections. The skin is the best barrier to infections. In addi-tion to the skin, mucus, ciliated epithelium, gastric acid, bile, tears, etc. confer basic natural protection against many viruses. The viruses enter the body through the respiratory tract, skin, conjunctiva, alimentary tract, and genital tract to initiate the infection by breaking these natural barriers to infection. Respiratory tract Many viral infections are caused by entry of virus through the respiratory tract. The viruses enter the respiratory tract by droplets containing the viruses expelled from the nose and Pathogenesis of Viral Infections By cytolysis no envelope UncoatingBy buddingforming NucleusReceptor Host cell aroundnucleic acid Capsid shedReplication Synthesis of viral mRNA (direct or via host machinery), synthesis of viral protein and nucleic acidAttachmentEnveloped virus AssemblyReleasePenetration FIG. 51-1.

Some viruses, after entry into body, are confined to the respiratory tract where they multiply and produce local dis-eases. These are known as respiratory viruses. Examples of these viruses are influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and Coxsackie virus A. Other viruses after entry, initially multiply at the site of respiratory tract followed by hematogenous or lymphatic spread to other sites of the body. At these sites, the viruses replicate in large numbers and cause systemic manifesta-tions of the disease. The examples of such viruses include measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Skin Many viruses enter the skin through abrasions or breaks in the skin. Molluscum contagiosum, cowpox, vaccinia, and vari-ola viruses enter the skin through minor lesions and produce cutaneous lesions at the site of entry. Other viruses, such as papilloma virus, enter the skin through minor injuries on the surface of skin, arboviruses by bite of insects, rabies virus by the bite of dogs and other animals, and hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by injection. Conjunctiva Some viruses may enter through the conjunctiva and may cause the disease. For example, adenovirus causes local mani-festations and measles virus causes systemic manifestation of the disease by entering through the conjunctiva. Alimentary tract The viruses also cause infection by entering through the alimentary tract, which is another important route of infec-tion by viruses. The viruses, such as rotaviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, hepatitis viruses, and other gastro-intestinal viruses cause infections of the gastrointestinal tract and produce disease. Rotaviruses, on ingestion, are carried to the intestinal tract in which they initiate the infection. Rotavirus is restricted to the gut, producing a local disease. Other viruses, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, and hepatitis viruses, on the other hand, initiate infections through the alimentary tract, replicate locally, and then are transported to other sites for subsequent replication and spread to target tissues, produc-ing systemic manifestations of the diseases. Natural barriers against viral infections include (a) the acidity of the stomach, (b) the alkalinity of the small intestine, and (c) secretory enzymes found in the saliva and pancreatic secretions. Intestinal mucus and secretory IgA antibodies are important and offer partial protection to the intestinal tract. Enveloped viruses usually fail to establish infection in the gastrointestinal tract, because these are destroyed by bile secreted in the gastrointestinal tract. Genital tract Viruses are also transmitted through sexual contact and enter the body through the genital tract. HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus are sexually transmitted and do not produce any local lesions in the genital tract but produce systemic manifestations. Papilloma viruses and herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are also transmitted sexually and produce lesions locally in the genital tract and perineum. Congenital infections Few viruses may cause congenital infection in fetus in utero being transmitted from the infected mother. Rubella and cytomegaloviruses are the viruses that are more commonly associated with congenital infections. Depending upon the age of the fetus, these viruses may cause malformations or even fetal death and abortion. Initiation of Infection at Primary Site (Infection of the Target Tissue) The viruses, on entry into the human host, may remain at the primary site of infection, replicate, and cause infection of the target tissue. The specificity of the virus-attachment proteins and tissue-specific expression of receptors during replication are two important properties of viruses to cause infection of target tissues. Key Points Many viruses cause infection in the oral mucosa or upper respiratory tract. Replication of viruses at the primary sites may be accompanied by clinical symptoms. Some viruses, on the other hand, may disseminate to other tissues through blood stream, lymphatic system, and neu-rons (secondary sites) and cause a systemic infection. Replication of Virus and Spread to Secondary Site The viruses are spread in the body mainly by the blood stream and the lymphatic system. Transport of virus in the blood is known as viremia. After multiplication in the lymph nodes, the virus enters the blood stream, resulting in primary viremia. In the blood stream, the virus may exist either free in the plasma or it may be ingested by the lymphocytes or macrophages. In macrophages, the viruses may die or replicate or may be car-ried by the mononuclear phagocytic system to the spleen and liver. Replication of the viruses in macrophages, in the endo-thelial lining of blood vessels, or in the spleen and liver results in production of viruses in large numbers. This leads to mas-sive spillover of the virus into the blood stream, causing sec-ondary viremia. This heralds the onset of clinical symptoms of viral infections including the prodromal phase in eruptive Chap-51.indd 441 5/14/2012 12:28:15 PMSection IV Chapter 51442 VIROLOGY fever. Subsequently, it is carried by blood stream to reach target organs (skin, brain, liver, etc.) in which the viruses replicate producing characteristic distinctive lesions. Viruses enter the brain or central nervous system (a) through the blood stream, (b) through the infected cerebrospinal fluid or meninges, and/or (c) through the infection of the peripheral and sensory (olfactory) neurons. Manifestations of the Viral Diseases The clinical manifestations of viral diseases depend on the complex interaction of virus and host factors. The outcome of the infection, that is, the disease manifestation depends on the: Age, general health, and immune status of the person, Dose of the infective virus, and Genetics of the host and the virus. After the host is infected by the virus, the immune status of the host plays an impor-tant role and determines the outcome of viral infection whether it will be an asymptomatic infection, a benign disease, or a life-threatening disease. Viral Pathogenesis at the Cellular Level The host cells show a variety of different responses to viral infection depending on the virus causing the infection and type of the cell infected. Moreover, the outcome of infection is determined by the properties of the virus and the cell. The host cells may be (a) permissive, (b) semipermissive, and (c) nonpermissive. A permissive cell is a cell that allows replication of a partic- ular type of strain of virus by providing biosynthesis com-pounds, such as transcriptional factors and posttransla-tional enzymes. A nonpermissive cell does not provide any biosynthesis com- pound, hence does not support replication of the viruses. A semipermissive cell may support some but not all the stages in viral infection. Replication of virus in cell may cause a broad spectrum of effects, ranging from nonapparent cellular damage to rapid cell destruction. Some viruses may cause cell death or even cell lysis. For example, polioviruses cause death of cells (cytocidal effect) and even lysis of the cells (cytolysis), molluscum contagio-sum cause proliferation of cells, and oncogenic viruses cause malignant transformation of cells. Some other viruses may cause alterations in cells' morphol-ogy, functional properties, malignant transformation, or antigenicity (Table 51-1). In some conditions, viruses infect cells and replicate indepen-dently within the cells without causing any cellular injury to the infected cells. This is known as steady state infection. In cell cultures, the virus produces demonstrable cellular changes in the infected cells known as cytopathic effects (CPEs).The cellular changes produced by the virus may be due to many factors. These cellular changes may be caused (a) by viral take-over of macromolecular synthesis of proteins and enzymes by viruses instead of host cell, (b) by accumulation of virus pro-teins or particles, or (c) by alteration or disruption of cellular structure. Production of early or nonstructured viral proteins often inhibits the production of host protein and synthesis of host DNA. The accumulation of large amounts of viral proteins or particles in the infected cells may lead to the modification or disruption of the cellular architecture. At the cellular level, depending on the nature of the virus and the cell infected, the virus infection in a cell can produce any of the three infections (Fig. 51-2): 1. Failed infection (abortive infection) 2. Cell death (lytic Infection) 3. Infection without cell death (persistent viral infection) Abortive Infection Some viruses cause failed or abortive infections in which those viruses do not multiply, therefore disappear from the cell. Lytic Infection Some viruses cause cell death or lytic infection. This occurs due to replication of virus in infected cell, which kills the target cell. The cellular injury caused by viruses may be due to combina-tion of several factors. Viruses adopt different mechanisms (Table 51-2) for preventing cellular growth and causing cell death as follows: Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis HSV, poliovirus, togaviruses, and poxviruses cause cell death by inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. These viruses during replication produce proteins that inhibit synthesis of cellular DNA and/or RNA. These viruses also produce other proteins, which break down host cellular DNA to components that serve as substrates for replication of viral genome.

Cell fusion Infections of cells with certain viruses cause the cells to fuse, resulting in the production of giant multinucleated cells. Infection by paramyxoviruses, herpes viruses, and retroviruses results in the expression of glycoproteins on the cell surface. This triggers the fusion of neighboring cells, resulting in the formation of large multinucleated giant cells called syncytia. Formation of syncytia facilitates spread of the virus from cell-to-cell and allows the virus to escape from the lytic effect of antibodies. The cell-to-cell fusion of infected cells is of two types: 1. Fusion from without: In this type, cell fusion occurs in the absence of new pro tein synthesis (e.g., Sendai viruses and other paramyxoviruses). 2. Fusion from within: In this type, cell fusion req uires new protein synthesis (e.g., HSV). Infection by viruses causes a variety of changes in infected cells as follows: Certain viruses cause alterations in the cytoplasm of infected cells, or lead to expression of virus-coded antigens on the surface of infected cells. For example, respiratory syncytial virus causes fusion of adjacent cell membrane, resulting in polykaryocytosis or formation of syncytia. The infected cell may confer new properties on the cells. For example, infection by influenza virus results in the appearance of viral hemagglutinin on infected cell surfaces, leading to hemadsorption or adsorption of erythrocytes to the cell surface. Some viruses cause apoptosis in the infected cells. Apoptosis is a process leading to cellular suicide that facilitates the release of viruses from the cell. Certain viral infections produce characteristic changes in the properties and appearance of target cells. For example, measles viruses, mumps viruses, adenoviruses, cytomega-loviruses, and aberra-tions and degradations. Infection by adenovirus types 12 and 31 and HSV cause marginated chromatin ring in the nuclear membrane. Transformation Transformation is an irreversible genetic process caused by the integration of viral DNA with the DNA of the host cell. Infection of cells with certain viruses causes transfor-mation of normal cells to malignant cells. The viruses that stimulate uncontrolled cell growth causing the transforma-tion of immortalization of the cell are known as oncogenic viruses.VirionHost cellPersistence of viral genome in host cell with no production of progeny virus Host genome Reactivation of latent virus after months or years in the future Abortive viral infections in which no progeny viruses are producedProductive viral infections where the host cell is not killed, although progeny virus is releasedViral infection that results in a latent viral state in the host cellViral infections resulting in host cell death and production of progeny1 2 3 4 FIG. 51-2.

The DNA oncogenic viruses infect semipermissive cells, which express only selected viral genes but do not produce complete virus. Key Points Most oncogenic DNA viruses integrate with host cell chro-mosome during transformation. For example, Epstein-Barr virus causes transformation of the cells by stimulating cell growth and inducing the expression of an oncogene (cell's bcl-2 oncogene) that prevents apoptosis or programmed cell death. Other viruses, such as adenovirus, papilloma virus, and SV40 induce expression of the genes, such as P53 and neu-roblastoma gene product which encode proteins that bind and inactivate all growth regulatory proteins. Loss of P53 gene makes the cell more susceptible to mutation, thus releasing the mechanisms that inhibit the cell growth. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) is the only oncogenic retrovirus, known to cause oncogenesis in humans. It encodes a protein (tax ) that transactivates gene expression, including genes for interleukin-2 and other growth-stimulat-ing lymphokines. The virus continues to produce virus in the transformed cells. Leukemia associated with HTLV-1 develops very slowly, 20-30 years after infection. Cytopathic effect Cytopathic effect, or CPE, is a term that denotes any visible change in the appearance of target cells infected by viruses. Some viruses can be tentatively identified by the nature of CPE in cell culture, as well as by the types of cells in which these viruses cause CPE.Inclusion bodies: Inclusion bodies are the characteristic histological feature in virus-infected cells reflecting the change in the appearance of the target cells. They may result from virus-induced changes in the membrane or chromosomal structure. They also represent the sites of viral replication or accumulation of viral capsids. Inclusion bodies are the struc-tures with distinct size, shape, location, and staining properties that are found in virus-infected cells. The inclusion bodies may be found in the nucleus (e.g., herpes virus), cytoplasm (e.g., pox-virus), or both (e.g., measles virus). Intranuclear inclusion bodies are of two types: Cowdry type A and Cowdry type B. Cowdry type A inclusion bodies are of variable size, and are produced by infection with herpes virus and yellow fever virus. Cowdry type B inclusion bodies are often multiple and more circumscribed, and are produced by adenovirus and poliovi-rus infection. Owl's eye appearance are typical intranuclear inclu-sion bodies demonstrated in cytomegalovirus infection (Fig. 51-3). These inclusion bodies may be acidophilic, which appear as pink structures when stained with Giemsa or eosin methy-lene blue stains. They may be basophilic as produced by some viruses, such as adenovirus (Table 51-3).Key Points Demonstration of inclusion bodies is characteristic of a par-ticular viral infection; presence of such bodies facilitates labo-ratory diagnosis: Negri bodies are the intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the neural cells and are pathognomic of rabies. Guarnieri bodies are small, multiple inclusions found in vaccinia-infected cells. Bollinger bodies are large inclusions seen in fowl pox. Molluscum bodies are very large inclusion bodies seen in the molluscum contagiosum infected cell . Persistent Viral Infection The persistent viral infection is characterized by viral infection without cell death. The persistent viral infection is caused by slow and gradual release of viruses from the infected cell through exocytosis or through budding from plasma membrane. The persistent viral infections may be ( a) nonlytic and productive (chronic), (b) latent, limited production of viral FIG. 51-3. Cytomegalovirus inclusion body (/H110031000).

HSV typically causes a latent infection in neurons that lack the machinery to transcribe the immediate early viral genes essential for viral replication. But stress and other stimuli activate successful replication of virus, resulting in the infection. Certain DNA viruses may cause infection of the cell, resulting in a latent or immortalizing infection. This occurs due to the failure of biosynthesis machinery of viruses for transcribing all the viral genes. The specific transcription fac-tor needed of such a virus may be expressed in growing cells or in specific tissues, or after treatment with hormones or cytokines. Host Response to Viral Infections The main goal of the host response in viral infection is (a) to eliminate the virus and (b) to eliminate the infected cells har-boring or replicating the virus. The host responds by immuno-logic and nonspecific means. The immune response is the best and most important means of controlling virus infections. Immunity in Viral Infections Protection against viral infections is induced by both humoral and cell-mediated immunities. Infection by the virus and sub-sequent replication induces immunity in the host against a wide range of virus antigens including the viral internal and surface antigens, nonstructural antigens, and early proteins (Table 51-4). Humoral immunity The humoral immunity mediated by antibody plays an impor-tant role against (a) infections caused by extracellular viruses and (b) viremias caused by those viruses. The humoral immu-nity also inhibits multiplication of cytolytic viruses. The cir-culating IgG and IgM antibodies are effective against viruses in blood and tissue spaces while IgA plays an important role against viruses replicating on the mucosal surfaces. The antibodies act against viruses in many ways: They prevent adsorption of virus to the cell receptor at the primary site of infection. They also cause rapid degradation of viruses and also prevent release of the viral progeny from infected cells. The antibodies in combination with complement cause damage to the enveloped viruses resulting in cytolysis of virus infected cells. The antibodies against surface antigens are usually more effec-tive than against internal antigens. The antibodies produced against surface antigens also vary in their ability to reduce infectivity of viruses. For example, the antihemagglutinin anti-bodies produced against hemagglutinin antigen of influenza virus neutralizes infectivity of the influenza virus, while anti-neuraminidase antibodies against neuraminidase antigen are not effective in neutralizing the infectivity of the virus. The antineuraminidase antibody however is helpful in preventing the release of virion progeny from infected cells. Humoral antibodies, although are protective, in some instances may cause injuries to host cells and contrib-ute to pathogenesis of disease. For example, antibodies in combination with complement initiate an immune complex disease in infections caused by hepatitis B virus and rubella viruses. Interferons and lymphokines stimulate flu-like symp-toms in respiratory virus infections and in viremia caused by arboviruses. Cell-mediated immunity Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a very important role in viral infections: CMI is essential for lysis of target cells in the infections caused by enveloped viruses and also in noncytolytic infec-tions caused by hepatitis A virus. Individuals with deficient cellular immunity are more susceptible to infection by viruses, such as herpes virus, measles virus, and poxvirus. CMI also plays a major role in recovery from viral infections. A deficient CMI results in failure to resolve the infection, which may lead to persistent viral infection, chronic disease, and even death of the patient. Viruses Pathology Immune mediators Enveloped viruses Delayed type hypersensitivity and inflammation T cells, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes arboviruses Flu-like symptoms Interferon, lymphokines Dengue virus Hemorrhagic disease T cell, antibody, complement Hepatitis B virus, rubella Immune complex disease Antibody, complement Human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, measles virus, influenza virusImmunosuppression T Chapter 51446 VIROLOGY CMI also contributes to pathogenesis of diseases by inducing T-cell-induced inflammatory and hypersensitiv-ity reactions. For example, CMI-induced inflammatory response is responsible for the typical clinical manifesta-tion of measles and mumps rather than cytopathologic effect of viruses. In dengue hemorrhagic fever, antigen-specific T cells and specific antibodies induce significant inflammatory and hypersensitivity damage to infected endothelial cells, leading to hemorrhage. Antigen-specific T cells are also responsible for inducing postinfection cytolysis in the infection caused by enveloped viruses, such as measles virus. T cells, macrophages, and polymor-phonuclear leukocytes induce a delayed type hypersensi-tivity and inflammation in many viral infections caused by enveloped viruses. Infection by some viruses is usually associated with suppressed host immunity; for example, infection by measles virus causes a temporary depression of delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin antigen and infection by HIV causes a depressed CMI following depletion of CD4/H11001 helper T cells. Once infected by a virus, it usually confers a lifelong immu- nity to reinfection. In some viral infections, such as influenza or common cold, the immunity is not lifelong, because the infection is caused by antigenically different strains of the same virus. Nonimmunological responses These include many factors as follows:Age: Age is the most important factor in determining the sus-ceptibility of the host to viral infections. Most viral infections are common and are more serious in the persons at extremes of age, such as infants, children, and elderly population. Infants and children are more susceptible to a variety of respiratory and exanthematous viral diseases. They are prone to more seri-ous disease caused by paramyxovirus, respiratory infections, etc. Similarly, the elderly people are susceptible to new viral infections (the new strains of influenza A and B virus) and reactivation of the latent viruses (e.g., varicella zoster virus).Poor nutrition: Poor nutrition or malnutrition affects the immune system of the infected person because tissue- regenerating capacity is usually decreased in a person with malnutrition. In such persons, some viral infection (such as measles) causes immunosuppression, thereby facilitat-ing replication of viruses in large numbers. This results in a serious disease associated with more serious and fatal complications.Genetic make up: Genetic make up of a person also plays an important role in determining the outcome of viral infection. Genetic differences in immune response genes and genetic defects in other genetic loci affect the susceptibility of the host to viral infection as well as the severity of infection.Body temperature: Fever is a common manifestation of many viral infections. Fever acts as a natural defense mechanism against virus infections as many of the viruses are inhibited by a higher temperature above 39\u00b0C.Interferons Interferons are a family of glycoproteins produced by cells on induction of infection by viral or nonviral microbial agents. These interferons show antiviral activity by inhibiting protein synthesis. Clinical Manifestations of Viral Diseases The clinical manifestations of viral diseases depend on complex interaction of virus and host factors: 1. The age, general health, and immune status of the person. 2. The dose of the infective virus. 3. The genetics of the host and the virus. After a host is inf ected by virus, the immune status of the host plays an important role and determines the outcome of viral infection\u2014whether it will be an asymptomatic infection, a benign disease, or a life-threatening disease.Incubation period: Incubation period is the time taken by the virus to spread from the site of entry to the organs of viral replication and then to the target organs for production of lesions. The duration of incubation period, therefore, depends on the (a) time taken for the site of entry, (b) multiplication, and (c) lesions. The incubation period for many viral diseases is variable: 1. It is short (1-3 days) in the infections caused by respiratory viruses or gastroenteritis caused by enteric virus, in which both the site of entr y and lesions are the same. 2. Incubation period on the other hand is longer in sys-temic (usually 10-20 days) diseases in which viruses enter through the respirator y or alimentary tract and produce lesions in different target tissues away from the site of entry. But in some systemic viral diseases, such as yellow fever or dengue fever, it may be relatively shorter (5-6 days). 3. Incubation period may still be longer (2-6 months) in hep-atitis B virus infection or ev en years in slow virus infection. Incubation periods of common DNA and RNA viruses viral infections are summarized in Tables 51-5 and 51-6, respec-tively. In some viral infections, the incubation Incubation period (days) Adenovirus B 50-150 (warts) 446 5/14/2012 12:28:15 PMSection IV Chapter 51PATHOGENESIS OF VIRAL INFECTIONS 447 proceed without symptoms, causing asymptomatic infections or may cause nonspecific early symptoms known as the pro-drome. Incubation period is the important initial period before the manifestation of characteristic symptoms of the disease. During this period virus replicates in the body of the host but has not reached the target tissue or caused sufficient damage in tissues of the host to cause the disease. The severity of the viral disease depends on the site of viral infection and on the immunopathological responses induced following the viral infection. It may be (a) an inapparent infec-tion, ( b) an acute infection, or (c) a chronic or persistent infec- tion. Inapparent infection is usually caused if: (a) the infection is controlled before the virus reaches the tar-get tissues, (b) the inf ected tissue is not damaged, (c) the tissue is damaged but it is rapidly repaired, or (d) the severity of damage is below a functional threshold for the particular disorder . The inapparent infections are detected usually by serological tests detecting specific viral antibodies in the infected host. Epidemiologically, the patients with inapparent or asymptom-atic infection serve as the major source of infection. The onset of acute or chronic viral disease depends on the ability of the immune system of the infected host to control and resolve the viral infection. If the immune system acts rapidly, the infection may result in acute disease; or if the immune system fails to act effectively or slowly, it may result in chronic viral dis-ease. Slow virus infections have typically long incubation period of many years before progressing to manifestation of the disease. Epidemiology Geographical Distribution Geographical distribution of the viral infections depends on (a) the presence of vectors for the transmission of disease, (b) cofactors facilitating the transmission of disease, and (c) the presence of susceptible population in the particular area. For example, the presence of suitable arthropod vectors for a particular virus in large numbers increases the risk of high prevalence of viral disease in that community. Viral diseases also show seasonal differences; for example, enteric viruses are more prevalent in the summer due to poor hygiene and use of contaminated water because of shortage of water supply. Similarly, respiratory viruses are more prevalent during winter due to overcrowding, which facilitates the spread of the viruses. The viral infection in a community may occur as an (a) outbreak, (b) epidemic, or (c) as pandemic: The outbreak of a viral disease usually occurs from a com- mon source, for example, infected food, and is seen only in clusters of people. Epidemics of viral infection, in contrast, occur in a large geographical area. An epidemic usually occurs due to intro-duction of a new strain of virus into an immunologically susceptible population, e.g., influenza epidemic. Pandemics are usually worldwide epidemics resulting from the introduction of a new virus, e.g., HIV. Pandemics of influenza have occurred as a result of introduction of new strains of influenza viruses. Reservoir and Sources of Infection Infected humans are usual reservoirs of viruses. They serve as source of infection for other susceptible hosts (HIV, poliomy-elitis, etc.). For many other viral diseases, animals also act as reservoirs. Viral infections transmitted from these animal reser-voirs to humans are called zoonotic viral diseases; for example, rabies is a zoonotic viral disease, and the infection is transmit-ted from the infected dogs, bats, foxes, cats, etc., to humans. Mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies are the arthropods that act as vectors for transmission of togaviruses, flaviviruses, bunyaviruses, and reoviruses. These viruses, hence, are called as arboviruses (from arthropod-borne viruses). Asymptomatic patients are the important source of infection. In HIV and varicella zoster virus infections, the viruses are usually released before the manifestations of the symptoms. Viruses changing the antigenic structure of their genome, e.g., influenza and HIV, infect a large number of immunologically naive population. Rhinovirus and other viruses with many different types similarly cause infection in a large number of susceptible persons. Transmission The mode of transmission of virus depends on (i) the site of viral replication and secretions and (ii) presence or absence of envelope in the viruses: 1. The site of viral replication and secretions: The viruses that replicate in the intestinal tract are excreted in the f eces and are transmitted by fecal-oral route (e.g., picornavirus and reovirus). The viruses that replicate in the respiratory tract, such as influenza virus, are secreted in aerosol drop-lets, hence are transmitted by inhalation.Diseases 12:28:15 PMSection IV Chapter 51448 VIROLOGY 2. Presence or absence of envelope in the viruses: The env eloped viruses are relatively fragile viruses, which require presence of intact envelope for their infectivity. These viruses are usually transmitted by respiratory drop-lets, saliva, mucus, blood or semen, organ transplantation, and by ingestion. Many of the enveloped viruses, since they are sensitive to the presence of acid and detergent, are destroyed rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract of the infected humans and hence are not transmitted by fecal-oral route. Hepatitis B virus and coronavirus are excep-tions, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route. Nonenveloped viruses are relatively sturdy viruses. These can resist drying, extremes of pH and temperature, and the effects of detergents. These nonenveloped viruses, therefore, with-stand the acidity of the stomach and lytic effect of bile in the intestine as well as they withstand mild disinfectants and insufficient sewage technique. Therefore, these viruses are gen-erally transmitted by the respiratory and fecal-oral routes and also often by contaminated objects (fomites). Hepatitis A virus is a common example of enveloped virus transmitted by fecal-oral route. Rhinoviruses and many other nonenveloped viruses are the examples of viruses that are transmitted by contact with fomites, such as handkerchief, towels, bed linens, etc. Prevention of Viral Diseases The viral diseases can be prevented and spread of viruses can be controlled by (a) adoption of good hygiene, (b) by control of the vectors, and (c) by immunization of the population. Immunization of the population by vaccines is the best means for the control of many diseases. Vaccines are available against many viral diseases (poliomyelitis, rabies). These protect the population against infection by viruses. Chap-51.indd 448 5/14/2012 12:28:15 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 52 bacteria, are obligate intracellular pathogens that use biosynthesis mechanisms and enzymes of the host cells for replication. Hence, it was feared that it may not be possible to inhibit viral replication without also being toxic to host cells, but currently newer antiviral drugs are used successfully for treatment of few viral diseases without causing much of toxicity or serious side effects. The first antiviral drugs to be used were like selective poisons that targeted cells with intensive DNA and RNA synthesis. Recently used antiviral drugs, however, act specifically against virus-coded enzymes or structures of the virus that are impor-tant for replication of the viruses. Marboran was the first antiviral drug used clinically for effective treatment of poxvirus infection in 1960. The compound was used successfully against eczema vaccina-tum and smallpox. Subsequently in 1962, an antineoplastic agent idoxuridine was found to be effective for treatment of herpetic eye infection, and amantadine (a molecule with an unusual structure) was found effective for treatment of influenza A virus. In 1970s, acyclovir (ACV) was used most successfully for treatment of herpes virus infection by administer-ing the drug parenterally. Subsequently, many antiviral agents have been distributed for use against many viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Box 52-1). 1. Herpes simplex virus 2. Varicella zoster virus 3. Cytomegalovirus 4. Human immunodeficiency virus 5. Influenza A virus 6. Respiratory syncytial virus 7. Hepatitis A, B, and C viruses 8. Papillomavirus 9. PicornavirusBox 52-1 List of viral infections against which antiviral drugs are availableMechanism of Action of Antiviral Drugs Recently, many antiviral drugs have been developed against viruses that are associated with high morbidity and mortal-ity in humans. These viruses provide potential targets dur-ing the cycle of replication for action by antiviral drugs. The viral infection may be inhibited at the level of (i) attachment, (ii ) penetration and uncoating, (iii ) transcription of viral nucleic acid, (iv ) translation of viral mRNA, (v ) protein synthe- sis, (vi ) replication biosynthesis and nucleoside scavenging, and (viii ) assembly and release of viral progeny. Mechanisms of action of antiviral agents against the possible targets are summarized in Table 52-1. Classification of Antiviral Drugs The antiviral compounds vary greatly in complexity and include nucleoside analogs, synthetic oligonucleotides, oligo-saccharides, and also natural products of plants and some inor-ganic and organic compounds. The antiviral agents available against viruses can be classified as: (a ) nucleoside Nucleoside Analogs Numerous analogs of naturally occurring nucleosides have been synthesized in the laboratory for their possible use against viruses. These nucleoside analogs that act by inhibiting the enzyme viral polymerase are generally activated by phos-phorylation by cellular or viral kinases.Antiviral Agents Key Points Nucleoside analogs cause selective inhibition of viral replication: by binding better to viral DNA polymerase, rather than to the cellular DNA polymerase; and by being utilized more extensively in virus-infected cells due to the more rapid synthesis of DNA in infected cells. Chap-52.indd 449 5/14/2012 12:27:45 PMSection IV analog. from the nucleoside guanosine by having an acyclic (hydroxyethoxymethyl) chain instead of a ribose or deoxyribose sugar. The ACV has selective action against herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella virus. It acts the viral enzyme thymidine kinase, encoded by these herpes viruses. The ACV is used for treatment of HSV infections, such as HSV encephalitis, disseminated herpes, and other serious life-threatening manifestations of herpes infections. The compound inhibits HSV replication in infected host cells but is ineffective to resolve the latent HSV infection. The ACV at higher doses is also effective against varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. The compound is less effec-tive against this virus because ACV is phosphorylated less efficiently the valyl that is well absorbed. Its bioavailability is 2-5 times more than ACV and is usually recommended for the treatment and suppression of genital herpes infection. Penciclovir Penciclovir is a guanosine analog. It has a higher affinity for HSV thymidine kinase than ACV but has a lower affinity for HSV DNA polymerase than ACV. It acts by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and also as a chain terminator. It is used for the treatment of genital herpes infection. Penciclovir is effective for treatment of both HSV and VZV. After administration, the drug is available in more quantity and persists for a longer time in infected cells than ACV. The penciclovir also has some antiviral activity against cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Ganciclovir Ganciclovir is a guanine nucleoside, chemically related to ACV. It differs from ACV in having a single hydroxymethyl group in the acyclic side chain. It acts as a chain terminator in subse-quent termination of viral DNA replication. It is highly effec-tive against all herpes viruses including cytomegalovirus. It is more active against cytomegalovirus (CMV) than ACV. It is more useful in treating severe CMV infections in immunocom-promised hosts, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ganciclovir resistance is a noted problem of therapy with ganciclovir.Virus Antiviral drug Mechanism of action Herpes simplex virus Acyclovir uncoatingNeuraminidase inhibitor Hepatitis C virus Interferon alpha Inhibits protein synthesis Respiratory syncytial virus Ribavirin Blocks capping of viral mRNATABLE 52-1 Mechanisms of action of antiviral drugs Chap-52.indd PMSection IV Chapter 52ANTIVIRAL AGENTS Azidothymidine (AZT) is the synthetic analog of thymidine and was the first useful antiviral agent to be reported for treat-ment of HIV infection. It acts by blocking the synthesis of pro-viral DNA by inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase. The latter is 100 times more susceptible to inhibition by AZT than host cellular DNA polymerase. Azidothymidine is widely used for treatment of HIV infec-tion. It is currently used for the management of HIV with reduced CD4 T-cell counts (400-500 or less) to prevent pro-gression of the disease. It is also used for treatment of pregnant HIV-infected women. It has been shown to reduce or prevent the trans-mission of HIV from the mother to the baby. The drug, however, is toxic and costly. Emergence of resistance to AZT is also a worrisome problem. Ribavirin Ribavirin is a synthetic analog of the nucleoside guanosine. Ribavirin triphosphate is the active form of the drug. It dif-fers from guanosine by having a base ring, which is incomplete and is open. Ribavirin is effective against many DNA and RNA viruses. It acts mainly by preventing replication of the viruses by inhibiting nucleoside biosynthesis, mRNA capping, and other processes essential for viral replication. When administered as an aerosol, ribavirin has been shown to be effective for treatment of severe respiratory syncytial viral infection in children and for treatment of severe influ-enza and measles in adults. Intravenous ribavirin is also effective for treatment of infections caused by influenza B virus and Rift Valley virus, and Lassa, Crimean-Congo, and other hemorrhagic fevers. Ribavirin in combination with interferon-alpha (IFN-/H9251) is shown to be effective against the infection caused by hepa-titis C virus. Dideoxynucleosides Dideoxynucleosides the analogs of nucleosides, have been synthesized for use against HIV. These agents act by inhibiting HIV replication by blocking the enzyme reverse transcriptase. These compounds inhibit the enzyme reverse tran scriptase by preventing DNA chain elongation. These com-pounds are usually recommended for the treatment of AIDS in patients not responding to therapy with AZT. These are also used in combination with AZT for treatment of the AIDS cases. Other Nucleoside Analogs These consist of a number of compounds fluorouracils, and adenine arabinoside. are They inhibit synthesis and rep-lication of viruses: by inhibiting the synthesis of thymidine, a nucleic acid essential for synthesis of viral DNA or by replacing thymidine with itself in the viral DNA. These are effective against viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), replication of which is associated with synthesis of large volume of viral DNA. Idoxuridine Idoxuridine was the first antiviral drug to be used for treat-ment of HSV but now has been replaced by trifluorothymidine and fluorouracil. These two compounds are more effective and less toxic for treatment of HSV. Fluorouracil is also used for topical treatment of warts caused by human papilloma viruses. Adenine arabinoside Adenine arabinoside is a adenosine. It differs from adenosine in having arabinose instead of ribose as the sugar moiety. It was used as an impor-tant antiviral agent for treatment of herpes virus infection until ACV become available. Recently, many other nucleoside analogs have been evaluated as antiviral agents for treatment of infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus, and herpes viruses. Non-Nucleoside Polymerase Inhibitors Non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors include foscarnet and related phosphonoacetic acid. These inhibitors inhibit replica-tion of viruses by binding to the pyrophosphate binding site of the DNA polymerase to block binding of nucleotides. Foscarnet specifically inhibits DNA polymerase of all herpes viruses and reverse transcriptase of the HIV. The compound has also shown antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus. Nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz are the other non- nucleoside polymerase inhibitors with different mechanisms of action. They bind to sites on the enzyme different from the substrate. These compounds are usually given in combination with other nucleoside analogs to delay or prevent emergence of drug resistance in HIV. Protease Inhibitors Saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and amprenavir are some of the examples of protease inhibitors. These agents act specifically on the unique structure of HIV protease, which is essential for the production of a functional HIV. Human immunodeficiency virus strains showing resistance to these drugs occur through mutation of the HIV protease. Hence, a combination of protease inhibitor with AZT and a nucleoside analog is usually recommended to reduce replication of viruses to minimum undetectable levels. Chap-52.indd 451 5/14/2012 12:27:46 (Adamantanamine hydrochloride, symmetrel) and rimantadine are anti-influenza drugs useful for treatment of influenza virus infections. These are not effective for treat-ment of influenza B or C viruses. These act specifically against influenza A virus by their ability to bind and to block protein channel by the matrix protein (M2) of the influenza A virus. Resistance to these drugs occurs due to mutations, resulting in changed M2 matrix protein or hemagglutinin protein. Amantadine and rimantadine are useful in reducing sever- ity of influenza A infection if taken within 48 hours of expo-sure. They are also useful as prophylactic agents in treatment of influenza A infection. Amantadine is also used for treatment of Parkinson's disease. The drug, however, is toxic to the central nervous system. Zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are the anti- viral compounds with clinical efficacy against both the influ-enza A and B viruses. They are potent inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase. Without production of the enzyme neuramini-dase, the hemagglutinin of the virus binds to sialic acid on other viral particles, forming clumps and thereby preventing release of virus particles. In several clinical trials, both the agents have demonstrated efficacy with minimal side effects. If taken within 48 hours of infection, these drugs reduce the duration of illness. Interferon There are three classes of interferon: (i) interferon alpha (IFN-/H9251), (ii) interferon beta (IFN- /H9252), and (iii) interferon gamma (IFN-/H9253). IFN-/H9251 occurs as at least 15 subtypes, the genes for which show 85% homology. Interferons are produced by leu-kocytes and many other cells in response to infection by virus, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), endotoxin, and mutagenic and antigenic stimuli. The dsRNA is a potent stimulator. The viruses that replicate slowly and viruses that do not inhibit syn-thesis of host proteins are usually good inducers of the inter-ferons. IFN-/H9253 differs from other interferons in being released as lymphokines from activated T cells, natural killer cells, and occasionally from macrophages. Interferons exert antiviral effect by several pathways as follows: 1. They cause increased expression of class I and class II MHC (major histocom patibility com plex) glycoproteins, thereby facilitating the recognition of viral antigens by immune system. 2. They activate the cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, the cells with the ability to destro y virus- infected targets. 3. They directly inhibit replication of viruses. Interf erons are now being increasingly used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C virus carriers who are at risk to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The interferon when given with ribavirin has proved to be more effective than interferon alone for treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. Currently, synthetic IFN-/H9251 is actively used against hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; papilloma virus; HSV; and rhinovirus. It is also condylomata acuminatum. Chap-52.indd 452 5/14/2012 12:27:46 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 53 Introduction The clinical manifestations may be protean and nonspecific for many of the viral infections. However, they provide a clue in the diagnosis of viral infections by exclusion of common bacterial, parasitic, fungal diseases, etc. Laboratory diagnosis, therefore, plays an important role in confirming viral etiology of sus-pected viral diseases. Laboratory diagnosis for viral diseases is performed to: 1. Confirm the viral etiology of diseases for which antiviral chemotherapeutic agents are a vailable. 2. Screen blood donors for blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), e tc., to prevent transmission of infection by transfu- sion of blood and blood-borne products contaminated by viruses. 3. Define the viral disease process. 4. Perform seroepidemiological studies of viral infections. 5. Monitor and detect epidemics of serious virus infections, such as influenza, encephalitis, and poliom yelitis, etc., ear- lier so as to initiate appropriate control measures to pre-vent further spread of these diseases. Methods of Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections can be carried out by many methods. These methods include ( a) demonstration of virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the cells, (b) direct detection of viruses, (c) virus isolation and viral assays, (d) detection of viral proteins and other enzymes, (e) detection of viral genome, and (f) viral serology (Fig. 53-1). Demonstration of Virus-Induced CPEs in the Cells Many viruses produce characteristic morphological changes in the cells they infect. These changes are known as CPEs, and the viruses causing the CPEs are known as cytopathogenic viruses. The characteristic CPEs include (a) change in cell morphology, such as rounding of cells or rounding and aggregation of cells, (b) syncytia formation, and (c) inclusion bodies formation. Replication of virus in infected cells may cause round-ing, refractility, degeneration, and nuclear pyknosis.

Approaches for laboratory diagnosis of viral infections. may finally lead to complete or partial cell lysis as well as vacuolation, as seen in picornaviruses. Viruses, such as adenoviruses, may cause rounding of cells and aggregate to form grape-like clusters. Viruses, such as paramyxovirus, varicella zoster, cause for-mation of syncytia containing several (up to 100) nuclei in infected cells. These syncytia are multinucleated giant cells formed by fusion of virus-infected cells with neighboring or uninfected cells. Inclusion bodies are intranuclear or cytoplasmic bodies pro-duced by viruses in infected cells. They are produced as a result of histological changes in infected cells caused by viral components. These are also produced as a result of virus-induced changes in cell structures. These inclusion bodies can be demonstrated on staining by light microscopy. These inclusion bodies may be acidophilic Chap-53.indd 453 5/14/2012 12:27:08 PMSection IV Chapter 53454 VIROLOGY or basophilic, small or large, round or irregular; and single or multiple. These bodies may be present either in nucleus or cytoplasm, or in both. Many viruses produce different types of inclusion bodies. For example, rabies virus produces intracyto-plasmic inclusion bodies called Negri bodies in neural tissue of the brain. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) produces intranuclear owl's eye inclusion bodies (Color Photo 53) in infected cells or in cell sediments excreted in the urine of the patient infected with CMV. Human herpes viruses produces Cowdry type A inclusion bodies. Measles virus produces inclusion bodies that are seen both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of infected cells (Table 53-1). Direct Detection of Viruses Viruses can be detected directly in clinical specimens by elec-tron microscopy (EM), fluorescence microscopy, and light microscopy. Electron microscopy Electron microscopy is the most commonly used method for direct detection of virus in clinical specimens for diagnosis of many viral diseases. EM can be used to detect distinctive viruses or viral structures directly in appropriate clinical specimens or in biopsy for diagnosis of viral infections. EM is not a routinely used test for detection of viral infection and is performed only in the laboratories equipped with electron microscope. Key Points Electron microscopy is used for detection of: rotaviruses and herpes virus in stool samples, herpes virus in brain biopsy specimens, and poxvirus in vesicle fluid. virus in cell Fluorescence fluorescence microscopy (DFA), using specific monoclo-nal or polyclonal antibody, is employed to detect viral antigens Approaches Methods Demonstration of virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the cellsCharacteristic CPEs include (a) change in cell morphology, such as rounding of cells, or rounding and aggregation of cells, (b) syncytia formation, and (c) inclusion bodies formation Direct detection of viruses Electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and light microscopy Virus isolation Animal inoculation, embryonated egg inoculation, and cell culture Detection of viral proteins and other enzymesThe enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), direct immunofluorescence assay, RIA, etc. Detection of viral genome DNA probes, dot blot or Southern blot analysis, Northern blot or RNA:DNA probe hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), (RT PCR) Viral serology Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, neutralization test (NT), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, ELISA, RIA, latex agglutination test (LAT), and Western blotTABLE 53-1 Laboratory procedures for diagnosis of viral infections on the cell surface or within the cells infected by viruses. The viral antigens can be detected (a) in the acetone-fixed cell smears, (b) in the frozen tissue sections of the cells from virus-infected cells, and (c) also in vesicular fluid. The DFA test has been employed for: antemortem diagnosis of rabies by detection of rabies-virus antigen in smears from the face or nape of the neck; demonstration of viral antigens in brain biopsy specimens of herpes simplex encephalitis and subacute sclerosing encephalitis; and by adenoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and orthomyxoviruses. Light microscopy Viral antigens in infected cell cultures are demonstrated by immunoperoxidase staining. Virus Isolation Demonstration of virus in appropriate clinical specimens by culture establishes diagnosis of viral diseases. Isolation of virus is always considered as a gold standard for establishing viral etiology of a disease. Collection of appropriate clinical speci-mens depends on type of the viral disease. For example, cere-brospinal fluid (CSF) is the specimen of choice for diagnosis of viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by arboviruses, picornavirus, or rabies virus. Blood is the speci-men frequently examined for diagnosis of HIV and hepatitis B, C, and D infections and other blood-borne viral infections. The tests of other clinical specimens to be collected for diagnosis of other types of viral diseases are summarized in Table 53-2. Timing of collection of specimen is important. The speci- mens collected early in the acute stage infection\u2014before the shedding of virus is stopped\u2014are most important. For exam-ple, enteroviruses are present in the CSF for only 2-3 days after the onset of CNS manifestations. Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus are found in lesions only within first 5 days of onset of symptoms and respiratory viruses are present in respiratory secretions during only first 3-7 days of onset of symptoms. Chap-53.indd 454 5/14/2012 12:27:10 PMSection IV Chapter 53LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF VIRAL DISEASES 455 Immediate transport of the specimen to laboratory for pro- cessing also facilitates better isolation of virus from clinical specimens. The viruses are usually heat labile, and the clini-cal specimens may be infected secondarily by contamination with bacteria and fungi. Hence, clinical specimens for viruses are usually transported and stored on ice. They are transported in special transport media that contain antibiotics to inhibit bacterial and fungal contaminants and also contain proteins, such as serum albumin or gelatin. Some of the viruses, such as influenza virus, HSV, and VZV lose their infectious titer when clinical specimens are stored at room temperature or kept fro-zen at /H1100220\u00b0C. Most of the viruses can be cultivated in (a) exper-imental animals, (b) embryonated eggs, or (c) tissue culture. Animal inoculation Mouse is most frequently used for isolation of viruses by animal inoculation. In addition, rabbits, hamsters, newborn or suckling rodents are also used. Experimental animals are rarely used for cultivation of viruses but play an essential role in study of pathogenesis of viral infections and that of viral oncogenesis. Intracerebral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intranasal routes are various routes of inoculation. After inoculation, the animals are observed for signs of disease or death. The infected animals are then sacrificed and infected tissues are examined for the presence of viruses by various tests, and also for inclusion bodies in infected tissues. Furthermore, infant (suckling) mice are used for isolation of coxsackie virus and rabies virus. Embryonated eggs Embryonated eggs were used initially for the growth of viruses. Embryonated chick egg was used first for cultivation of viruses by Goodpasture in 1931. The method further developed by Burnet was used for cultivation of viruses in different sites of the embryonated egg. Usually, 8-11 days' old chick eggs are used for culture of viruses. The viruses are isolated in different sites of the egg, such as yolk sac, amniotic cavity, and allantoic cavity, and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) (Fig. 53-2).System Direct examination Isolation Serology Respiratory system Nasopharyngeal aspirate (IF, EM) Throat swab, throat washings Paired sera CNS Brain biopsy (IF, EM), CSF (EM, IF) Feces, blood (for arbovirus), CSF, and brain biopsy Paired sera Skin Vesicular/pustular fluid swabs Paired sera Liver Serum and feces Blood (for yellow fever) Serum Congenital infections Nil Throat swab, products of conception Single sera (mother and baby) Gastro-intestinal tract Stool (antigen detection, EM for rotavirus) Not cultured Paired sera (ELISA) IF, immunofluorescence; EM, electron microscope; ID, immunodiffusion; LM, light microscopy.TABLE 53-2 Laboratory specimens for diagnosis of viral infections Chorioallantoic membrane Amniotic cavity Shell Shell membrane Allantoic membrane Yolk sac AlbumenAir sac FIG. 53-2. Embryonated egg inoculation. Many of these viruses cause well-defined and characteris- tic foci, providing a method for identification, quantification, or assessing virus pathogenicity. The embryonated egg is also used for growing higher titre stocks of some viruses in research laboratories and for vaccine production.Yolk sac: Yolk sac inoculation is used for cultivation of Japanese encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis, and West Nile virus. It is also used for growth of chlamydia and rickettsia.Amniotic cavity: Inoculation in the amniotic cavity is used mainly for primary isolation of influenza virus.Allantoic cavity: Inoculation in the allantoic cavity is used for serial passages and for obtaining large quantities of virus, such as influenza virus, yellow fever (17D strain), and rabies (Flury strain) viruses for preparation of vaccines. For production of rabies virus, duck eggs were used due to their bigger size than that of hen's egg. This helped in production of large quanti-ties of rabies virus, which are used for preparation of the inacti-vated non-neural rabies vaccine.Chorioallantoic membrane: Inoculation of some viruses on CAM produced visible lesions known as pocks. Each infec-tious virus particle produces one pock. The pox viruses, such as variola or vaccinia are identified by demonstration of typical pocks on the CAM inoculated with the pox virus. Nowadays, in a virology laboratory, chick embryo inocula-tion has been replaced by cell cultures for routine isolation of viruses. Chap-53.indd 455 5/14/2012 12:27:10 PMSection IV Chapter 53456 VIROLOGY Tissue culture Cell culture is most widely used in diagnostic virology for culti-vation and assays of viruses. The tissue culture was first applied in diagnostic virology by Steinhardt and colleagues in 1913. They maintained the vaccinia virus by culture in tissues of rabbit cornea. Subsequently, Maitland (1928) used cut tissues in nutrient media for cultivation of vaccine viruses. Enders, Weller, and Robins (1949) were the first to culture poliovirus in tissue cultures of nonneural origin. Since then, most of the virus had been grown in tissue culture for diagnosis of viral dis-eases. Different types of tissue cultures are used to grow viruses. Tissue culture can be of three different types as follows: Organ culture This was used earlier for the isolation of some viruses, which appear to show affinity for certain tissue organs. For exam-ple, coronavirus, a respiratory pathogen, was isolated in the tracheal ring organ culture. In this method, small bits of the organs are maintained in vitro for days and weeks preserving their original morphology and function. Nowadays, organ cul-ture is not used. Explant culture In this method, components of minced tissue are grown as explants embedded in plasma clots. Earlier, adenoid tissue explant cultures were used for isolation of adenoviruses. This method is now seldom used in virology. Cell culture Cell culture is now routinely used for growing viruses. In this method, tissues are dissociated into component cells by treat-ment with proteolytic enzymes (trypsin or collagenase) followed by mechanical shaking. The cells are then washed, counted, and suspended in a growth medium containing essential amino acids and vitamins, salts, glucose, and a buffering system. This medium is supplemented by up to 5% of fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cell suspension is dispensed in glass or plastic bottles, tables, or Petri dishes. On incubation, the cells adhere to the glass surfaces and divide to form a confluent monolayer sheet of cells covering the surface within a week (Fig. 53-3). The cell culture may be incubated either as a stationery culture or as a roller drum culture. The latter is useful for growth of some fastidious viruses due to better aeration by rolling of the culture bottle in special roller drums. The cell cultures are clas-sified into three different types based on their origin, chromo-somal characters, and number of generations for which they can be maintained, as follows (Table 53-3):Primary cell culture: These are a culture of normal cells obtained freshly from the original tissues that have been cultivated in vitro for the first time and that have not been subcultured. These cell cultures can be established from whole animal embryo or from selected tissues from adult, newborn, or embryos. These cells have the normal diploid chromosomal number and are capable of only limited growth (5-10 divisions) in culture. They cannot be maintained in serial culture, but can be subcultured to obtain large number of cells. Monkey kidney cell culture (Fig. 53-4, Color Photo 54), human embryonic kidney cell culture, and chick embryo cell culture are the common examples of primary cell culture. Primary monkey kidney cell cultures are highly useful for the primary isolation of myxovirus, paramyxovirus, many enteroviruses, and some adenoviruses.Diploid cell strains: Diploid cell strains are of a single cell type that retains their original diploid chromosome number and karyotype. However, they have specific characteristics and compositions and are usually composed of one basic TABLE 53-3 Cell lines in common use Cell lines Examples Primary cell culture Rhesus monkey kidney cell culture Human amnion cell cultureChick embryo fibroblast cell culture Diploid cell strains Human embryonic lung cell strain (WI-38) Rhesus embryo cell strain (HL-8) Continuous cell linesHuman carcinoma of cervix cell line (HeLa)Human epithelioma of larynx cell line (Hep-2)Human carcinoma of nasopharynx cell line (KB)Human synovial carcinoma cell line (McCoy)Sternal marrow cell line (Detroit-6)Human conjunctiva (C), intestine (I), liver (L), and kidney (K) cell line (Chang C/I/L/K)Vervet monkey cell lineBaby hamster kidney cell line (Vero)Transformed cells A tissue is treated with enzymes to separate the cellsCells are suspended in culture mediumNormal cells grow as a monolayerCell cultures FIG. 53-3.

They are usually fibroblasts and can be cultured for maximum 50 serial passages before they undergo senescence (die off) or undergo a significant change in their characteristics. Diploid cells derived from human fibroblasts are useful for isolation of some fastidious viruses. They are also used for production of vaccines; for example, WI-38 human embryonic lung cell stem is used for the cultivation of fixed rabies virus, and human fetal diploid cells for isolation of adenovirus, picornaviruses, HSV, CMV, and VZV.Continuous cell lines: Continuous or immortal cell lines are cells of a single type, which are derived from cancerous tissue and are capable of continuous serial cultivation indefinitely without senescing. The cells are usually derived from diploid cell lines or from malignant tissues and have altered and irregular number of chromosomes. Immortalization may occur spontaneously or can be induced by chemical mutagens, tumorigenic viruses, or oncogens. Hep-2, HeLa, and KB derived from human carcinoma cervix, human epithelioma of larynx, and human carcinoma of nasopharynx and other cell lines are excellent for recovery of a large number of viruses. These cell lines have been used extensively for the growth of a number of viruses. These cell lines are usually stored at /H11002 70\u00b0C for use when necessary or are maintained by serial subculture. The type of cell line used for virus culture depends on the sensitivity of the cells to a particular virus; for example, Hep-2 cell line is excellent for the recovery of respiratory syncytial viruses, adenoviruses, and HSV. Most of the viruses can be isolated by using one of these cell lines. Growth of viruses in cell cultures can be detected by the following methods: Cytopathic effect : Many viruses can be detected and initially identified by observation of the morphological changes in the cultured cells in which they replicate. The CPE pro-duced by different types of viruses are characteristic and help in the initial identification of virus isolates. Nuclear shrinking, vacuoles in the cytoplasm, syncytia forma-tion, rounding up, and detachment are the examples of alteration of morphology of the cells. Most CPEs can be demonstrated in unfixed and unstained monolayer of cells under low power of microscope. For example, adenoviruses produce large granular changes resembling bunches of grapes, SV-14 produces well-defined cytoplasmic vacuola-tion, measles virus produces syncytium formation, virus produces discrete focal degeneration, and enterovi-ruses cause crenation of cells and degeneration of the entire cell sheet. Hemadsorption: Hemadsorption is the process of adsorp- tion of erythrocytes to the surfaces of infected cells which serves as an indirect measurement of viral protein synthe-sis. This property is made use of to detect infection with noncytocidal viruses as well as the early stage of cytocidal viruses. Viruses, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, mumps virus, and togavirus, when infect cell lines code for the expression of red cell agglutinins, which are expressed on the infected cell membrane during infections. These hem-agglutinins bind some erythrocytes to the infected cell sur-face. Sometimes, viruses can be detected by agglutination of erythrocytes in the culture medium. Heterologous interference: This property is used to detect viruses that do not produce classic CPEs in the cell lines. In this method, the growth of non-CPE-producing virus in cell culture can be tested by subsequent challenge with a virus known to produce CPEs. The growth of the first virus will inhibit infection by the cytopathic challenge virus by inter-ference. For example, rubella virus usually does not produce any CPE, but prevents the replication of picornaviruses, which is inoculated as a cytopathic challenge virus. Transformation: Oncogenic viruses that are associated with formation of tumors induce cell transformation and loss of contact inhibition in the infected cell lines. This leads to surface growth that appears in a piled-up fashion producing microtumors. Examples of such oncogenic viruses that pro-duce transformation in cell lines are some herpes viruses, ade-noviruses, hepadanoviruses, papovavirus, and retroviruses. Light microscopy: Viral in infected cell cultures are demonstrated by staining virus-infected cells of tissue sec-tions with specific viral antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase. This is followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide along with a benzidine derivative substance. In a positive reaction, a red insoluble precipitate is deposited on the cell line, which is demonstrated by examination under ordinary light microscope. Immunofluorescence: Direct immunofluorescence using specific antibodies is frequently used to detect viral antigens in inoculated cell lines for identification of viruses. Electron microscopy : The viruses can also be demonstrated in infected cell lines by EM. Viral Assays The virus content of a specimen can be assessed either by estimating total virus particles count or by assay of infectivity of viruses. FIG. 53-4. Normal monkey kidney cell lines (/H110031000). Chap-53.indd 457 5/14/2012 12:27:10 PMSection IV Chapter 53458 VIROLOGY Total virus particles count Electron microscopy and hemagglutination are the two meth-ods used for estimation of total virus particles.Electron microscopy: EM is useful to count virus particles directly in a negatively stained viral suspension. In this method, the virus suspension is mixed with a known concentration of latex particles, and the number of virus particles in the suspen-sion is estimated by a ratio between the virus and latex particles demonstrated by EM.Hemagglutination: Quantitation of hemagglutinating viruses is carried out by determination of hemagglutination titers. Although it is not a sensitive method, it is used as a convenient method of virus assay. For example, approximately, 10 7 influ- enza virions are essential to produce microscopic agglutination in cultured cells. Assay of infectivity of viruses Quantitative and quantal assays are the two types of assays, which are carried out to determine assay of infectivity of viruses.Quantitative assay of infectivity: Quantitative assay is used to estimate the presence of actual number of viable infectious viral particles in the inoculum. Two methods are available for the purpose, which include plaque assay in monolayer cell culture and pock assay on chick embryo CAM. (a) Plaque assay: It was introduced by Dulbecco in 1952 as a modification of bacteriophage plaq ue assay. This is based on the principle that each infectious viral particle gives rise to a localized focus of infected cells that can be visual-ized by the naked eye. Such foci are called plaques, and each plaque indicates an infectious virus. The test is performed by adding a viral inoculum to a monolayer of culture cells in a bottle or Petri dish. After sometime, this allows adsorp-tion of viruses. The liquid medium is removed and replaced with a solid agar gel to ensure that the spread of progeny virus is confined to the immediate vicinity of infected cells. (b) Pock assay: Viruses that form pocks on C AM can be assayed by counting the number of pocks formed on the inoculated CAM. Each pock on CAM arises from a single virus particle. This is known as pock assay. Vaccinia and carried out to quantitate a virus by quantitating the virus particles in animals, in embryonated eggs, or in tissue culture. This method of assay of infectivity only indicates the presence or absence of infectious viruses, but it does not indi-cate actual number of viruses. The endpoints used for infec-tivity titrations are estimated by the ( a) development of CPE in cell cultures, (b) production of hemagglutination in allan-toic fluid of embryonated egg, or (c) death of experimentally infected animals. The titer of virus is usually expressed as the \"50% infectious dose (ID 50)\" per mL, which indicates the high- est dilution of the inoculum that initiates detectable symp-toms, antibodies, or other responses in 50% of inoculated test animals, eggs, or cell cultures.Detection of Viral Proteins and Other Enzymes During replication of viruses in host cells, viral proteins, antigens, and other enzymes are produced. These viral products and com-ponents can be detected by many methods including biochemical, immunological, and molecular methods in clinical specimens. (ELISA), direct immu- nofluorescence assay, and radioimmunoassay (RIA) are widely used methods. These methods are used for detection and identi-fication of viruses and viral antigens in clinical specimens, as well as in cell cultures. These tests use specific monoclonal or mono-specific antibodies that are raised against specific viral antigens. Identification and quantification of specific virus can also be carried out by detection and assay of characteristic viral enzymes. For example, detection of reverse transcriptase in serum or cell culture suggests the presence of a retrovirus. Similarly, demonstration of hemagglutinins or hemadsorption in the cell culture indicates the presence of influenza virus. Detection of Viral Genome The unique genomic structure and genetic sequences are the most important characteristics of the type and family of virus. Therefore, recently molecular methods are increasingly used for diagnosis of viral diseases. The restriction endonucle-ase fragment lengths from the genome of DNA viruses, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2 or the electrophoretic pattern of RNA viruses, such as influenza and reo viruses are considered as genetic fingerprints for these viruses. The methods for detection of viral genome include (a) DNA probes, (b) dot blot or Southern blot analysis, (c) Northern blot or RNA:DNA probe hybridization, (d) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and (e) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR). Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe The DNA probes are highly sensitive and specific tools used for detection of virus in clinical specimens even in the absence of replication of virus. In this method, two strands of the target DNA in clinical specimens are first separated and then allowed to hybridize with a labeled single-stranded DNA probe. Enzyme-labeled or fluorescent-labeled DNA probes with sequences complementary to unique nucleic acid sequences of a viral genome can be used for detecting a virus. The hybridized labeled probe, after hybridization, can be detected by enzymatic or fluorescence method depending on the label used. The commercially available DNA probes are available for detection of CMV, papillomavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus in clinical specimens. In situ hybridization is also used for the detection of integrated or nonintegrated copies of viral genomes in fixed permeability biopsy specimens in persistent infections or viral malignant conditions. DNA probe is especially useful for: studying the expression of specific viral genomes on the different cell types; Chap-53.indd 458 5/14/2012 12:27:11 PMSection IV Chapter 53LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF VIRAL DISEASES 459 Viral Serology Viral serology is based on detection of specific viral antibod-ies in serum of the infected human host. A wide number of serological tests are used for demonstration of specific viral antibodies in patient's sera. These include hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, neutralization test (NT), indirect fluores-cent antibody (IFA) test, ELISA, RIA, latex agglutination test (LAT), and Western blot. The detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody in serum indicates a recent primary infection. This is because IgM antibodies appear in the serum during first 2 or 3 weeks of primary infection. A fourfold increase in the antibody titer between the serum collected during the acute phase of the disease and during the convalescent phase, 2-3 weeks after acute phase, is suggestive of seroconversion. An anamnestic or secondary antibody response occurs during reinfection or recurrence of viral infection later in life. The serum antibody titer usually remains high in individuals who suffer frequent recurrence of the disease, such as herpes virus. HI test is used for detection of viruses that agglutinate red blood cells of chickens, guinea pigs, human, or other mammals. Antibodies present in serum prevent viruses to bind and to agglutinate the new blood cells. The HI test is used for diagnosis of infections caused by orthomyxoviruses. NT is based on inhibition of infection by the antibody and that of CPEs of the viruses in tissue culture cells. The neu-tralization antibody response is usually virus and strain spe-cific. The highest dilution of serum preventing infectivity is 50% of virus. Serum mixture tested is considered as the titer of the test. ELISA is most commonly used for screening of blood samples for hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV. IFA, RIA, and LAT are also used for diagnosis of many common viral infections. Western blot is most commonly used to confirm infection caused by HIV, initially diagnosed by ELISA. Key Points The viral serology has following uses: It is used to identify the virus and its strain or serotype. It is used to determine whether viral infection is an acute or chronic infection, or primary infection or reinfection. It is used for diagnosis of viral infections that cause dis-eases of long duration. It is used for diagnosis of infections caused by viruses that are difficult to culture. The limitations of serological tests in viral diseases are the following: 1. The presence of antiviral antibody in serum only indicates infection but canno t determine whether it is recent or old. Demonstration of IgM antibodies or demonstration of a fourfold increase in the antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera indicates only recent infection. 2. The serological tests may be associated with false-positive or false-negative reactions. The serological cross-reaction ma y occur between different viruses, giving rise to false- positive reactions. Formation of immune complexes in serum may give rise to false-negative reaction as observed in viral infection caused by hepatitis B virus. detecting, in clinical specimens, viral genomes that do not provide any CPE or for which no serological test are avail-able; and detecting slowly replicating or nonproductive viruses, such as human papilloma virus or CMV. Southern blot analysis Southern blot analysis or dot blot is used to detect viral genomes in clinical specimens. In this method, the viral genome or restriction endonuclease cleavage fragments of the genome are blotted onto nitrocellulose papers and then detected on the paper by their hybridization to DNA probes. Northern blot analysis Northern blot analysis or RNA:DNA probe hybridization is a method also followed for detection of viral genomes. In this method, electrophoretically separated viral RNA are transformed onto a nitrocellulose paper and then detected by their hybridization to DNA probes. Polymerase chain reaction It is a DNA amplification system that allows a millionfold amplification of a target sequence of nucleic acids, at least 100,000-folds in a few hours. This method is useful for diagnosis of viral infections caused by HIV-1, HIV-2, CMV, human papilloma virus, HSV, hepatitis B, morbillivirus, echovirus, rhinovirus, measles virus, rotavirus, etc. The PCR is useful specifically for detection of: latent and integrated sequences of viruses, such as retrovi-rus, herpes virus, papilloma viruses, and other viruses and viruses present in low concentration in clinical specimens. Chap-53.indd 459 5/14/2012 12:27:11 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 54 Introduction Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses. They are the viruses that infect bacteria. They are obligate intracellular parasites that multiply inside bacteria by making use of some or all of the host biosynthesis machinery. They are also called phages. These extra- chromosomal genetic elements usually survive outside a host cell due to the presence of a nucleic acid genome surrounded by a protein coat. Phages occur widely in nature in close association with bacteria and are distributed widely in the soil, feces, and in other substances in the environment. They are associated with transmission of genetic material from one bacterium to another. The activities of bacteriophage were first described by Twort in 1915, who described it as an infectious agent that distorted the appearance of the colonies of staphylococci. Subsequently, d'Herelle in 1979 demonstrated the lytic activities of the culture filtrate on bacterial colonies. He suggested that the lytic agent was a virus and gave it the name bacteriophage (phage: to eat). Morphology Most of the phages consist of single, linear, and double-stranded DNA genome (Fig. 54-1). This genome is surrounded by a protein coat known as phage capsid. Large phages usually consist of a head and a tail. The head encloses the genome, and the tail is used as an organ of attachment as well as the conduit Bacteriophages through which phage DNA passes into the host cell. best-studied phages are the T-even phages (T2, T4, the bacteria Escherichia coli. These phages are tradition-ally considered as the prototype for describing the morphology of bacteriophages. Phages are tadpole-shaped with a hexagonal head and a cylindrical tail. Head: All phages contain a head structure, which can vary in size and shape. It is icosahedral (20 sides) or filamentous in shape. The size of the head measures between 28 and 100 nm in length. The capsid of bacteriophage head encloses a com-partment that contains the nucleic acid, which in most of the phages is a double-stranded DNA molecule. This DNA is protected against degradation by environmental nucleases by virtue of its location inside the bacteriophage head. However, a group of phages that specifically infect male strains of E. coli contains only RNA. The capsid or protein coat of a virus is composed of individual proteins known as capsomeres. Tail: Many but not all phages have tails attached to the phage head. The tail consists of a hollow tube through which the nucleic acid passes during infection. The tail of complex phage like T4 is surrounded by a contractile sheath, which contracts during infection of the bacterium, and a terminal tail plate. The spikes and tail fibers both originate from the tail plate and specifically bind to receptors on the outer membrane of the bacterial cell wall. Key Points Phages vary considerably in their morphology. Phages that are spherical or filamentous and that possess single-stranded DNA or RNA have also been described. Phages show high host specificity. They usually inhabit the intestinal microbial flora of humans and animals. They pass through filters, which hold back the bacteria. These are inactivated by boiling. Life Cycle Phages exhibit two different types of life cycle: Lytic cycle: also known as virulent cycle. In this cycle, intra-cellular multiplication of the phage results in the lysis of host bacteria, resulting in release of progeny virions. Lysogenic cycle: also known as temperate cycle. In this cycle, phage DNA becomes integrated with the bacterial genome and replicates with the bacteria synchronously without causing any harm to the host cell.HexagonalheadDNA core Tail fibers ProngsBase plateTailDemarcationbetween headand tail IV Chapter 54BACTERIOPHAGES 461 cell. During this period, the synthesis of bacterial proteins, DNA, and RNA stops. It is noteworthy that phage DNA, head proteins, and tail proteins are synthesized separately in the bacterial cell.Assembly and maturation: The protein subunits of the phage head and tail aggregate spontaneously to form the compact capsid. The DNA is condensed into a compact poly-hedral shape and packaged into the head. The assembly of the phage component into the mature infective phage particles is known as maturation.Release of progeny phages: New mature progeny phages are released by lysis of the bacterial cells. During the replica-tion of phages, the bacterial cell wall is weakened by lysozyme. Finally, the cell wall bursts as a result of osmotic pressure. This is known as lysis from within. The interval between the infection of a bacterial cell and the first release of mature daughter phages is known as the latent period. The interval between the entry of phage nucleic acid into the bacterial cell and the appearance of the first infec-tious intracellular phage particle is known as the eclipse phase. The average yield of daughter phages from the infected bacterial cell is known as the burst size. The period during which the num-ber of infectious phages released rises is known as the rise period. Lytic cycle is enumerated by a plaque assay. A plaque is a clear area, which results from the lysis of bacteria. Each plaque arises from a single infectious phage. Lysogenic Cycle Infection with every phage does not result in lysis of the host cells. Unlike virulent phages, which cause lysis of the host cell, some phages (such as temperate phages) integrate into the genome of the bacterial chromosome without causing any lysis of the bacteria. The integrated phage nucleic acid is known as the prophage. The prophage behaves like a segment of the host chromosome and multiplies synchronously with it. This phenomenon is known as lysogeny. The bacterium that carries a prophage within its genome is called lysogenic bacterium and such phages are called lysogenic or temperate phages.Lytic Cycle The lytic cycle of a virulent bacteriophage shows the stages of (a) adsorption, (b) penetration, (c) synthesis of the phage com-ponents, and (d) release of progeny phages.Adsorption: Adsorption is the first stage and is a specific process. This stage depends upon the susceptibility of the bac-terium to the specific phages. The specificity of the phage is determined by the presence of chemical receptors on surface of the bacteria. Adsorption occurs by random collision and is dependent upon concentration of both susceptible bacteria and the phage. It is a very rapid process and under optimal con-ditions is completed within minutes. The sites of the receptors for bacteriophage in bacteria are different and may be situated in different layers of the cell wall or on the surface structure. For example, bacteriophage recep-tors are found on the outer membrane of the cell wall of E. coli, in the Vi antigen of Salmonella, in glycosylated teichoic acid of Bacillus subtilis, and in portions of outer membrane of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Adsorption is a specific biochemical reaction; hence bac- teriophages can infect only certain host bacterial cells. This process is so specific that it is used to classify bacteria within a given species. Bacterial strains having the same bacteriophage receptors are classified together. When the numbers of phages adsorbed is less, it may only affect the permeability of the mem-brane. Lysis of the host cell occurs only if an adequate number of phages invade the bacterium. Infection usually does not occur in the absence of adsorption. However, infection of the bacterium directly by naked phage nucleic acid can occur, and this process is known as transfection.Penetration: Adsorption is followed by penetration of phage nucleic acid into the bacterial cell. Phages with contractile tails behave as hypodermic syringes, injecting the phage DNA into the bacterial body through the hollow core (Fig. 54-2). Penetration through the cell wall is facilitated by an enzyme lysozyme present in the tail core that produces a hole on the bac-terial cell wall. The phage DNA then passes through the central tail core into the host cytoplasm, while the empty protein capsid remains attached to the cell surface. More than one phage can adsorb to a host cell and inject its DNA. If more bacteriophages are adsorbed, they make so many holes in the cell wall that it causes lysis of the cell, a phenomenon called lysis from without . The empty head and tail of the phage, after penetration, remain outside the cell surface as the empty shell or ghost. After entry, the phage DNA is rearranged to a circular form, and this process is known as circulation of phage DNA.Synthesis of phage components: Synthesis of phage compo-nents begins immediately after penetration of the phage nucleic acid. Early proteins are the first products to be synthesized. These early proteins include the enzymes, such as nucleases, synthetic enzymes, and RNA polymerase. These early proteins are essen-tial for the building of complex molecules peculiar to the phage. Subsequently, late proteins are synthesized, which include (a) protein subunits of phage, (b ) structural proteins necessary for the virion self-assembly, (c ) enzymes involved in maturation, and (d ) proteins used in the release of bacteriophages from the Process of injection of phage DNA into host cell Injection ofphage DNA Host cell FIG. 54-2. Process of injection of phage DNA into host cell. 461 5/14/2012 12:26:42 PMSection a temperate phage, the DNA from the temperate phage enters the host cell, which inside the cell forms a circle and by a single recombinant event becomes inte-grated into the DNA of the bacterium. The host bacterial cell, now called the lysogenic cell, replicates the phage DNA or pro-phage every time it divides. Sometimes, during the multiplica-tion of lysogenic bacteria, the phage may become excised from the bacterial chromosome. The excised prophage can initiate a new lytic cycle resulting in release of daughter phage parti-cles. These daughter phage particles also infect other bacterial cells and make them lysogenic. This is known as spontaneous induction of prophage. All lysogenic bacteria on exposure to ultraviolet rays, hydrogen peroxide, and nitrogen mustard can also be induced to shift to the lytic cycle. A lysogenic bacterium is resistant to reinfection by the same or related phages. This is called as superinfection immu-nity. During lysogeny, the prophage confers certain new proper-ties on the lysogenic bacteria. This is known as lysogenic or phage conversion. The examples of phage conversions are as follows: 1. Phage-mediated conversion of somatic antigens of Salmo-nella: This occurs when a large number of tem perate phages of Salmonella modify antigenic properties of somatic O For example, Salmonella Anatum h:1,6) antigenic formula (3,15:e, h:1,6), which is an antigenic formula of Salmonella Newington. 2. Toxigenicity of Corynebacterium diphtheriae : The presence of prophage be ta (/H9252) is responsible for production of toxin in C. diphtheriae. Removal of the prophage makes the bacte- ria nontoxigenic. Similarly, nontoxigenic C. be made with /H9252 phage. 3. Toxicity of Clostridium botulinum: To xin production in C. botulinum type C and D is determined by the presence of phages CE/H9252 and DE/H9252, respectively. Elimination of the phages abolishes the toxigenicity of the bacillus. 4. Transduction: Bacteriophages ma y act as carriers of gene from one bacterium to another. This is known as transduc-tion. This phenomenon has been described in many bac-teria and is recognized as one of the main mechanisms of transfer of genetic material among bacteria in nature. This has been discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Table 54-1 summarizes the comparison of multiplication of bacteriophages and viruses.Uses of Bacteriophages Bactriophages have following uses: They are convenient model for study of virus host interaction. They play an important role in transmission of genetic information by process of transduction. They are used as cloning vectors for genetic manipulations. They are used for phage typing. Bacteriophage Typing Different strains of a serologically or otherwise identical species of bacteria are susceptible to one or more different bacterio-phages. When a suspension of phages is deposited on the lawn culture of a susceptible bacterium, an area of clearing occurs after incubation due to lysis of the susceptible bacteria by the phages. These zones of lysis are called plaques. The shape, size, and nature of plaques are characteristic for different phages. Since a single phage particle is capable of producing one plaque, plaque assay can be used for titrating the number of viable phages in preparation. On the basis of this phenomenon, many bacterial species can be divided into various phage types. Phage typing has been used in epidemiological study of infec-tions or outbreaks caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, and many other bacteria. Different phages are available, which show difference in their specificity for genus, species, or strains. Examples are (i ) genus-specific bacteriophages for Salmonella, (ii) specific bacteriophages for all members or strains of Bacillus anthracis, and (iii) for all members of V. cholerae bio-type classical (e.g., Mukherjee's phage IV). all strains but not V. cholerae biotype Eltor. Phage typing of S. aureus is a pattern method in which a set of standard phages is employed for intraspecies typing of staphylococci. A strain of Staphylococcus may be lysed by a num- ber of phages. Hence, the phage type of a strain is designated by the number of the different phages that lyse it. Phage typing of Salmonella Typhi is carried out by using prophage, which is active against only fresh isolates of S. Typhi possessing the Vi antigen.

These viruses, which belong to family Poxviridae, include a large group of DNA viruses that are morphologically similar and share a common nucleocapsid protein. Classification The family Poxviridae, based on whether they infect insect or vertebrate hosts, has been classified into two subfamilies, Chordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae. The subfamily Chordopoxvirinae contains viruses that infect vertebrate hosts and include eight genera, of which at least four genera cause diseases in humans. These genera are as follows:Orthopoxvirus: The genus Orthopoxvirus includes the pox- viruses of the viruses of ungulates that may cause occasional infections in humans. These viruses are orf viruses, pseudocowpox virus, deerpox viruses, and bovine papular stomatitis virus.Yatapoxviruses: These include tanapox viruses and yabapox viruses that are found mainly in Africa.Molluscipoxviruses: These include molluscum contagiosum virus.Most of the poxviruses that cause diseases in humans belong to the genera Orthopoxvirus and Parapoxvirus. Smallpox and molluscum contagiosum viruses are specific human patho-gens, whereas other poxviruses cause rare zoonotic infections in humans. The poxviruses causing infections in humans are listed in Table 55-1. Variola (Smallpox) Virus Smallpox caused by variola virus has been eradicated from the world in 1980 following an intensive worldwide campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the possible use of smallpox virus as an agent of bioterrorism is the main concern now. Properties of the Virus Morphology Variola virus shows following features: The variola virus is a large, brick-shaped virus measuring 300 /H11003 200 /H11003 200 nm, almost visible by light microscopy. The virion consists of protein (90%), lipid (5%), and DNA (3%). The viral genome consists of a large, double-stranded, linear DNA that is fused at both ends. The DNA measures 130-375 kbp in size and has a terminal loop. The extracellular virion possesses two envelopes, while the intracellular virus has only one envelope. The outer envelope Poxviruses Virus Diseases Variola Smallpox Vaccinia Used for smallpox vaccinationIn patients with eczema causes eczema vaccinata and in patients with immunodeficiency causes progressive vaccinia Monkeypox A disease similar to smallpoxCowpox A localized disease, such as milker's node Orf Localized lesion, such as a single chronic granulomatous lesion with a central ulcer Molluscum contagiosumA self-limiting condition with localized lesions of the skinCauses chronic and extensive skin lesions in patients with HIV Tanapox Localized lesions, such as a single, pock-like vesicular lesion on the skin Yabapox Localized lesions the extracellular virion consists of host cell lip-ids and several virus-specific proteins including hemagglu-tinins. These virions consist of a large number of proteins (more than 100), at least 10 of which show enzymatic activity needed for replication of the genome. The virus consists of many enzymes that facilitate in the syn-thesis, polyadenylation, and methylation of viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Viral replication Poxvirus replication is complex. Among the DNA viruses, they are unique in that the complete replication cycle of the virus occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The virus encodes the enzymes required for mRNA and DNA synthesis essential for genetic replication. The virus encodes and carries all proteins necessary for synthesis of mRNA. The virus also encodes pro-teins for other functions, such as DNA synthesis and immune escape mechanisms. Finally, the virions are assembled and acquire their envelopes by budding from the cell membrane as they are released from the cell. Other properties Susceptibility to physical and chemical reagents: Variola virus is most stable at low temperature and low humidity. It remains viable for months at room temperature, if protected from sunlight and in the cold or when freeze-dried for years. It is resistant to action of 50% glycerol and 1% phenol. Even though enveloped, the virus is not susceptible to ether, hence is not inactivated by ether. It is susceptible to ultraviolet light and other irradiations and is also readily inactivated by forma-lin and oxidizing disinfectants.Antigenic properties: Smallpox virus has a single serotype, which was responsible for successful vaccination against the disease. All poxviruses including vaccinia viruses have a common nuclear pro-tein antigen. These poxviruses contain at least 20 different anti-gens, such as LS antigen, agglutinogen, and hemagglutinin. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Chick embryo Both variola and vaccinia viruses grow in the chick embryos. They produce pocks on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of 11-13 days' old chick embryo within 48-72 hours. Key Points Variola virus produces small, shiny, white, convex, non-necrotic, and Vaccinia viruses produce larger, irregular, necrotic, pock lesions, some of which may be hemorrhagic. Cell culture Variola virus can be grown in chick embryo cells, monkey kidney, and HeLa cells. Unlike the vaccinia virus, which produces cytopathic effects (CPEs) rapidly within 24-48 hours, the variola virus produces CPEs very slowly. The CPEs consist of Guarnieri bodies, which are eosinophilic inclusion bodies that consist of aggregation of virus parti-cles in matrix. These can be demonstrated in stained preparations. Laboratory animals Variola virus causes experimental infection only in monkeys. Intranasal infection of monkeys by variola virus causes smallpox in monkeys with generalized skin lesions. Scarification of cornea of rabbit with variola virus causes keratitis with demonstration of characteristic Guarnieri bodies in the stained smears of cornea. Pathogenesis and Immunity Pathogenesis of small pox Smallpox caused by variola virus is acquired by respiratory route through inhalation of nasal, oral, or pharyngeal drop-lets. The infection can also be acquired by direct contact with infected skin or fomites. The virus enters the human host though the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The poxviruses encode many proteins, which initially stimu-late host cell growth and then lead to cell lysis and viral spread, thereby facilitating their replication in the cells, lysis of infected cells, and viral spread. The virus replicates at the site of inoculation and spreads to lymph nodes draining the site of mucosal entry. The virus replicates in the lymphoid tissues, causes transient viremia, and infection of the reticuloendothelial cells. This is followed by a secondary phase of multiplication in these cells, lead-ing to a secondary viremia. This results in clinical manifesta-tions of the disease, which manifests as fever and other toxic manifestations. The viruses then enter the skin, localize in the blood vessels of the skin, and produce characteristic rash of the smallpox. The rash is due to the replication of virus in the skin followed by the damage caused by cytotoxic T cells, damaging the virus-infected cells. Host immunity Variola infection is characterized by development of both humoral and cellular immunities. Humoral immune response includes the appearance of hemagglutination inhibition (HI), complement fixing (CF), and neutralizing (NT) antibodies within first to third week of infection. The HI and CF antibody levels usually decrease within a year, whereas NT antibod-ies persist longer, for many years and decades after infection. Humoral antibodies are not protective. Cell-mediated immu-nity plays an important role in controlling and resolving the disease. Virus-specific T cells control the spread of viruses by causing lysis of infected cells in the reticuloendothelial cells in the skin. An attack of smallpox gives complete protection against reinfection. Vaccination confers immunity, which lasts about 10 years. Chap-55.indd 464 5/14/2012 12:26:08 PMSection IV Chapter 55POXVIRUSES 465 Clinical Syndrome Variola virus causes smallpox, the disease which is now extinct. Smallpox The incubation period varied from 10 to 14 days. The prodro-mal phase, which correlated with the phase of viremia, was the first to appear. Onset of disease was sudden. The condition manifested as sudden onset of fever, severe headache, nausea, pharyngitis, body malaise, and backache. An exanthematous rash would appear on the palate, tongue, and pharynx during the later part of the prodromal stage. The smallpox rash was characterized by skin lesions that are in the same stage of evolution, unlike those lesions seen in chickenpox. The lesions in chickenpox appear in successive waves and in various stages, such as vesicles, pustules, and scabs. The skin lesions first appear on the face and extremities and then spread centrifugally to the trunk. These lesions begin as macules and then develop into papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusts during a period of approximately 17 days. The lesions heal with formation of characteristic scarring. Overwhelming toxemia was the usual cause of death in patients with smallpox. There were two variants of small-pox: variola major and variola minor. The variola major was associated with a fatality rate of 25-30%, while variola minor was associated with a low fatality rate of less than 1%. In addition, flat smallpox and hemorrhagic variola were the unusual mani-festations of smallpox in some patients, and were usually fatal. Epidemiology The world is free of smallpox. Geographical distribution The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was detected in Somalia in 1977. The last recorded case in humans, which was due to an accidental laboratory infection, was reported in England in 1978. The WHO in 1980 declared that smallpox was eradicated from the world. At present, the only remaining known virus isolates are stocked in the laboratories at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and at the Vektor Institute in Russia. However, during 1990s, it was learned that the smallpox virus has been used by some countries in their biological warfare program. It is not known how many countries still possess the virus in their laboratories. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Smallpox was a highly infectious disease. Respiratory secretions and exudates of the skin lesions were the most common sources of infection. The disease was most commonly transmitted by inhalation of respiratory droplets from smallpox patients. The patients were highly infectious during the first week of rash, once fever had started. The features of the smallpox that con-tributed to its total eradication are summarized in Box 55-1. Laboratory Diagnosis Smallpox was usually diagnosed clinically. The main criteria for clinical diagnosis of smallpox included: febrile prodromal phase occurring 1-4 days before the onset of rashes; characteristic smallpox lesions of the skin (deep, firm, round), which could be umbilicated or confluent; and skin lesions in same stage of development on any part of the body. Specimens Skin lesions, such as vesicular fluid, were the specimens of choice. Microscopy Electron microscope, if available, was used for direct demonstration of typical virus particles in clinical specimens. It was useful to differentiate a smallpox virus from that of the chickenpox. The Guarnieri bodies, the characteristic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, can be demonstrated in stained preparation of the clinical specimens by light microscopy. 1. Smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination program due to the availability of an effective vaccine. 2. A safe, stable, economical, and easy to administer smallpox vaccine was available. 3. Presence of scar indicated the successful vaccination against smallpox. 4. There was only a single serotype of variola virus; hence immunization by vaccines protected against all cases of smallpox. 5. Human and other animal poxviruses share common antigenic determinants. Safe vaccines prepared from animal poxviruses could also be used for vaccination against humans. 6. Smallpo x exhibited strict host specificity to humans. Humans were the only reservoirs of infection. No animal reservoirs or vectors w ere incriminated. 7. The clinical manifestations of smallpox were consistently typical; hence cases could be detected and diagnosed easily. 8. These facilitated detection of human cases of smallpox and implementation of preventive measures to prevent transmission of infection to o ther suscep tible human hosts. 9. Subclinical infections did not occur and also chronic carriage of the virus did not occur. The source of infection was a patient with smallpo x who could be easily de tected in the community and treated, and preventive measures were ensured.Box 55-1 Features of the smallpox that contributed to its total eradication Chap-55.indd 465 5/14/2012 12:26:08 PMSection IV Chapter 55466 VIROLOGY Isolation of the virus Isolation of the virus in the laboratory is carried out by inocula-tion in the chick embryo and in cell culture. This is necessary for rapid and accurate identification of poxvirus infections.Embryonated egg: Inoculation of vesicular fluid into the CAM of the chick embryo is a reliable method for detection and identification of variola virus. The virus produces characteristic pocks after 48-72 hours of inoculation. The variola pocks are smaller, whereas vaccinia pocks are centers. The tenapoxvirus, molluscum contagiosum, and the Parapoxvirus do not show any growth on the CAM.Cell culture: Human and nonhuman primate cells, such as monkey kidney and HeLa cells, are used for isolation of virus from clinical specimens. Viruses are detected by the presence of Guarnieri bodies, the characteristic CPE produced by the vari-ola virus. Unlike the vaccinia virus, which produces the CPE rapidly within 24-48 hours, the variola virus produces the CPE very slowly. Tenapoxvirus and parapoxviruses grow poorly, whereas mol- luscum contagiosum does not grow at all in the cell cultures. Serodiagnosis Serological tests were useful to confirm the diagnosis of poxvi-rus infection. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and HI, CF, and NT tests are available for demonstration of serum antibodies that appear after first week of infection. Treatment No specific antiviral agents are available against variola virus. Methisazone is of some value against some poxviruses. It is rec-ommended only for chemoprophylaxis but not for treatment. Vaccinia immune globulin is recommended for treatment of all complications except postvaccinated encephalitis. Although smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, concern still exists about the possible occurrence of smallpox through bioterrorism. Prevention and Control Smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by success-ful immunization program. Empirical preventive measures against smallpox had been used in India and China even before the first millennium. The practice of variolation carried out by intentional inoculation with some virulent strains of variola to prevent against variola infection spread from India to the Old World and subsequently East Europe in the eighteenth century. This procedure of variolation became very popular in Europe till it was replaced by vaccination introduced by Jenner 1796. The variolation conferred lifelong immunity in vaccinated individuals. It was a risky procedure and was associated with a mortality rate of approximately one-tenth of that seen in indi-viduals with naturally occurring disease. Moreover, inoculated individuals were capable of transmitting smallpox to suscep-tible individuals for sometime after variolation.In 1960s, the WHO formulated a concept program for global eradication of smallpox. The disease was then present in 44 countries with a global incidence of around 10 million cases annually. By use of highly potent and stable vaccine, rapid iden-tification of outbreaks, and carrying out ring vaccination in all contacts of a person who are infected (refer the box \"Vaccine\"), the disease was finally eradicated in 1977 when the last case of endemic smallpox was detected in Somalia. Vaccines The smallpox vaccine is a live preparation of vaccinia virus propagated on the skin of cows. The vaccine is applied by scari-fication, which causes a local pustule that subsequently heals with formation of scab. Subsequently, the virus is grown on the skin of calves to reduce the risk of transmitting syphilis and other diseases during vaccination. Originally, Edward Jenner inoculated with pustular material containing the cowpox virus. Vaccinia virus used as a vaccine replicating at the site of inoc- ulation produces local erythematous maculopapules. These lesions subsequently vesiculate and finally heal by producing a scab over a period of 10-14 days. Finally, resolution of the lesions takes place by formation of pustule followed by scaling and healing. The resolution of the disease is associated with development of immunity to variola infection that persists for up to 10 years. Vaccinia Virus Vaccinia virus is unique in that it is an artificial virus and does not occur in nature as such. Vaccinia virus was used as the smallpox vaccine. Edward Jenner originally used the cowpox virus for vaccination against smallpox. During subsequent years, the original virus strain was maintained by means of arm-to-arm inoculation, and was maintained as dry material on threads. Over a period of time, the virus mysteriously under-went some permanent changes from its original cowpox form in the strain of vaccinia now used in vaccines. This vaccinia virus could be readily differentiated from fresh isolates of cowpox and smallpox viruses. Vaccinia virus is now being extensively studied in greater detail than variola, as it is safer to work with (Fig. 55-1). The virus is also being used as a vector for development of recombinant vaccines. Both vaccinia and variola viruses show similarity in their morphology. They, however, can be differentiated by their growth properties and host range. Key Points Vaccinia virus can be cultured in vitro on CAM. The virus is iden-tified by its characteristic pock lesion on the CAM. The vaccinia virus produces relatively larger, irregular, flat, and necrotic lesions, some of which may be hemorrhagic (Table 55-2). Vaccinia virus has recently been shown to be closely related to the New World orthopoxviruses, Cantagalo, and Aracatuba viruses. Chapter 55POXVIRUSES 467 Vaccinia virus, which is used for vaccination, can also cause infection in humans. Vaccinia causes infection by accidental inoculation of the skin. At the site of inoculation, the lesion begins as maculopapular rash, progressing to vesicles, pustules, and finally leading to formation of scab. The lesion heals with formation of marked scarring. Vaccinia virus in patients with eczema causes eczema vaccinata in patients with immuno-deficiency causes progressive vaccinia. Monkeypox Monkeypox can cause infection in humans and produce a disease similar to smallpox. This virus was first isolated in 1958 from captive monkeys in Copenhagen. First human infection with this virus was described in the early 1970s. Cases of monkeypox have been described as a rare zoonotic infection in West and Central Africa, especially in Zaire. The subsequent cases of monkeypox were reported in North America in 2003. The origin of the infection was traced to exotic rodents imported from Africa. Monkeypox infection is acquired by handling infected animals, such as monkeys and squirrels. Person-to-person transmission is unusual. Clinically, monkeypox cannot be distinguished from smallpox. The condition manifests with development of a generalized pustule, rash, fever, and toxemia. Electron micros-copy is useful to demonstrate the virion particles in clinical spec-imens for diagnosis of the condition. Buffalopox Buffalopox, believed to be caused by vaccinia virus, occurs among buffaloes in India. In the infected buffaloes, the viruses produce pustular lesions on the teats and udders of lactating buffaloes. The individuals, such as milkmen, coming in con-tact with these infected buffaloes suffer from the infection. The lesions usually develop on the hands and faces of the milkmen. Buffalopox appears to be distinct from variola and vaccinia viruses. Smallpox vaccine does not confer protection against infection by buffalopox. Cowpox Human infection with cowpox is usually an occupational hazard. Cowpox resembles antigenically variola and vaccinia viruses but can be differentiated by the hemorrhagic lesions it produces on CAM and rabbit skin. Cowpox infection in cows produces ulcers on the teats and udders. It may spread to other cows and humans during the process of milking. Natural cowpox infection has also been noted in wild animals kept in zoos including cheetahs and ele-phants and also in domestic cats. Rodents or cats but not cows have been suggested as the primary host of cowpox infection. Milker's node or paravaccinia is an occupational disease acquired by humans during the process of milking of infected cows. The common lesions include small ulcerating nodules (Fig. 55-2). The condition presents as painful and hemorrhagic lesions on the hands and face (Color Photo 55) associated with pyrexia and other constitutional disturbances. The virus is distinct from cowpox and grows in bovine kidney cell culture, but not in embryonated eggs. Orf Orf is an infection of humans caused by virus of contagious pustular dermatitis of sheep and goats.

Chap-55.indd 467 5/14/2012 12:26:08 PMSection IV Chapter 55468 VIROLOGY occurs a single chronic granulomatous lesion with a cen-tral ulcer. The lesions usually present on hands, forearm, or occasionally on the face. The lesions heal without forming any scars. The virus resembles paravaccinia virus morphologically. Molluscum Contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus unique to humans. The virus is spread by close contact, often through sexual contact. The virus causes a disease of the skin usually seen in children and young adults. It causes small, pink, papular pearl-like benign tumors of the skin or mucous membranes. These lesions are present on the epidermis and occur on most parts of the body except on soles and palms. Lesions are more commonly found on the trunk and anogenital areas. This is a self-limiting condi-tion and the condition generally resolves over a period of time. Molluscum contagiosum in patients with HIV may cause chronic and extensive skin lesions. Sections of the nodular lesions show hyaline acidophilic inclusion bodies called molluscum bodies. Their bodies are large and measure 20-30 /H9262m in size and are composed of large numbers of virion particles embedded in a protein matrix. These inclusion bodies can be seen in the cells of stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum (Fig. 55-3). Humans are the only susceptible host. The virus cannot be grown in embryonated eggs, tissue cultures, or animals. Tanapox Tanapox virus was first isolated from the cases of febrile illness that occurred along the Tana river in Kenya during 1950s. The virus produces single, pock-like vesicular lesion on the skin, which usually do not progress to form pustules. This lesion is most commonly seen on the upper part of the body. The virus is acquired by insect bite from monkeys and other wild animal reservoirs. It is antigenically not related to other poxviruses. The virus grows in human and monkey tissue culture but does not grow in embryonated egg. Yabapox Yabapox virus produces large benign tumors in monkeys. It causes benign histiocytomas 5-20 days after muscular or sub-cutaneous inoculation to monkeys. Such lesions have been reported in persons handling affected monkeys. FIG. 55-2.

Molluscum contagiosum inclusion bodies (/H110031000). All doctors and nurses want to be vaccinated by smallpox vaccine in a hospital because of a sudden threat of bioterrorism this year. Since there is a limited supply of smallpox vaccine, the hospital authorities formulate a guideline to vaccinate only those medical and paramedical staff who were not vaccinated earlier. Which year the vaccination by smallpox vaccine was stopped in India? Which age population in India will be most susceptible group to smallpox in case of a potential threat of bioterrorism? After vaccination, at what point the staff receiving the smallpox vaccine will be considered to be fully protected from smallpo x? How will you diagnose smallpox that occurs in susceptible persons in the laboratory?CASE STUDY Chap-55.indd 468 5/14/2012 12:26:09 family Papovaviridae consists of papovaviruses, which are a group of viruses containing small, enveloped, icosahedral cap-sid with a double-stranded, circular DNA. The term papova is derived from the first two letters of the names of the viruses (pa, papillomaviruses; po, polyomaviruses; and va , vacuolating agents). The family is divided into two genera Papillomavirus and Polyomavirus. Currently, the genus Papillomavirus is separated into a new family Papovaviridae, and the genus Polyomavirus into a new family Polyomaviridae. The papovaviruses encode proteins that promote cell growth. They induce both lytic infections and tumors (benign or malig-nant). These viruses are capable of causing lytic, chronic, latent, or transforming infections depending on the host cells infected. Human Papillomaviruses Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causative agents of papillomas, which are the benign tumors of squamous cells or warts on the skin. These are also associated with cancerous con-ditions in humans, such as cervical carcinoma. HPVs causing diseases in humans are summarized in Table 56-1. Classification Based on DNA homology, tissue tropism, and association with oncogenesis, the HPVs have been classified into 16 groups (A-P), containing at least 70 types.Properties of the Virus Morphology Human papillomaviruses show following features: They are double-stranded DNA virus without any envelope. The viruses are slightly larger than polyomaviruses and mea-sure 50-55 nm diameter. They have an icosahedral capsid, composed 72 capsomeres. The viral genome is a supercoiled, double-stranded DNA composed of approximately 3000 base pairs (bp). The DNA encodes seven to eight early genes (E1-E8) and two late (L1 and L2) genomes. All these genes are present in a single strand, that is the \"/H11001 \" strand. Two of the early genes E6 and E7 are implicated in carcinogenesis, whereas E1 and E2 partici-pate in DNA replication. Viral replication Papillomaviruses show tropism for epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. The viruses during their rep-lication in epithelial cells are dependent on the specific fac-tors that are present in sequential differentiated states of epithelial cells. The early genes of the virus are responsible for growth of cells and facilitate replication of viral genome during cell division. The virus-induced cell growth causes thickening of the basal and prickle cell layer of stratum spinosum. The late genes encode for the expression of structural proteins, which are present in the differentiated upper layers of the skin. This causes the tissues to be excreted with the dead cells of the upper layer. Antigenic and genomic properties The HPVs show a widespread diversity. Based on the homology between their genomes, more than 100 distinct HPVs have been recognized. Certain HPV types show distinct predilection for infecting certain tissues. Approximately 30 types of HPVs infect the genital tract: HPV-6 and HPV-11 causing the genital warts. HPV types 1-6 primarily cause skin warts. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Human papilloma viruses do not grow on any cell culture. Hence, cell cultures are not useful for diagnosis of HPV infections.Papovaviruses Virus Diseases Papillomavirus Skin wartsBenign head and neck tumorsAnogenital wartsCancerous conditions (oral premalignant lesions and oral squamous intraepithelial cervical neoplasia cancer)Recurrent Chapter 56470 VIROLOGY Pathogenesis and Immunity Human papilloma viruses show high degree of host specific-ity. They show a high predilection for the skin and also for mucous membrane. HPV infection is acquired by close con-tact, and the infection is initiated by infections of the skin or mucous membranes. Tissue tropism and manifestation of the disease depend on the HPV type that causes disease (Table 56-2). Pathogenesis of human papilloma virus infections After infection, the virus replicates in the squamous epithe-lium of the skin to cause warts and in the mucous membrane to induce epithelial proliferation, such as oral, genital, and conjunctival papillomas. The warts occur as a result of virus-caused cell growth and thickening of the basal and prickle lay-ers of the stratum spinosum as well as the stratum granulosum. The presence of the koilocytes is the hallmark of the HPV infections of the skin. These koilocytes are the enlarged keratocytes with well-demarcated halos surrounding small nuclei. The HPV infection always causes a localized infection and the warts usually resolve spontaneously possibly as a result of immune response.Key Points Certain types of HPV are associated with dysplasia and may become cancerous with the action of cofactors. Human papilloma virus-16 and HPV-18 are known to cause cervical papillomas and dysplasia. Integrated HPV DNA, rather than plasmid-like DNA, had been demonstrated in more than 85% cases of cervical carcinoma. The E6 and E7 proteins of these two viruses have been identified as oncogenes. These oncogenes have been found to interfere with the normal function of regulatory proteins, such as p53, p16, and TRb, thereby facilitating the outgrowth of the tumors cells. Human papilloma virus has also been associated with devel- opment of oral premalignant conditions as well as malignant conditions in humans. HPV-16 as well as HPV-18, HPV-33, and HPV-35 have been linked with (a) verruciform proliferation in the oral cavity, (b) oral premalignant lesions, and (c) oral squamous cell carcinoma. Host immunity The exact mechanism responsible for resolution of papillomas is not known. Cell-mediated immunity, however, appears to play an important role in the resolution of the disease. The con-ditions that depress cell-mediated immunity, such as in patients with HIV and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, give rise to exacerbation of HPV infection and leads to more severe manifestation of the disease. Clinical Syndromes Human papilloma virus infection causes: (a) cutaneous warts, (b) benign head and neck tumors, (c) genital warts, and (d) cancerous conditions in humans (Table 56-2). Cutaneous warts Cutaneous warts are commonly caused by HPV-2, HPV-4, and HPV-7. Warts usually develop on the hands and feet after incuba-tion period of 3-4 months depending on the HPV type and the site of infection. They may appear flat, plantar, or dome shaped. The plantar and flat warts are most common in children and young adults. Wart is usually a benign and self-limiting condi-tion, which resolves during the course of time. Benign tumors of head and neck These include oral papilloma, laryngeal papilloma, and conjunctival papilloma. Oral papillomas are usually single but may be multiple. They are sessile, verrucous, and white with raised borders. These lesions usually appear on the lips, hard palate, or gingiva. Focal epithelial hyperplasia or Heck disease is commonly caused by HPV-13 and HPV-32. This condition manifests as multiple, smooth, and sessile nodules present on the mucosal surface of the lower lip or on the buccal mucosa. This condition was described in North American Cutaneous syndromesSkin warts:Plantar wart 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 7, 26, 29 Flat wart 3, 10, 27, 28, 41 Epidermodysplasia verruciformis 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21-25, 36, 38, 46 Warts in organ transplant patients 75, 77 Hand warts of meat and animal handlers7 Mucosal syndromesBenign head and neck tumors:Laryngeal papilloma 6, 11 papilloma 11 Keratoacanthoma 37Anogenital warts:Condyloma acuminatum 1, 16, 30, 44, 45Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cancer11, 16, 18, 31, in children, caused by HPV-6 and HPV-11. This is the most com-mon benign epithelial tumor of the larynx. Genital warts Genital warts or condyloma acuminata is caused by HPV-6 and HPV-11. The condition typically manifests as solitary or multiple cerebriform and pink lesions, which appear more commonly on the nonkeratinized mucosa than on the keratin-ized mucosa. These genital lesions may also spread to the oral cavity during sexual activity involving orogenital contact. Cancerous conditions Certain types of HPV\u2014commonly, HPV-16 and less frequently, HPV-18, HPV-33, HPV-35\u2014have been associated with oral premalignancy and malignancies in humans. These conditions are associated with verruciform proliferations in the oral cavity. Oral premalignant lesions and oral squamous cell carcinoma caused by HPV-16 and HPV-18 are most commonly associated with intraepithelial cervical neoplasia and cancer. The condi-tions progresses from mild to moderate neoplasia to severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ during a period of 1-4 years. Epidemiology Geographical distribution HPV infections are found worldwide. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Human papilloma viruses have been detected in the oral cavity of estimated 6-10% of children and adolescents, and in 5-80% in healthy adults. HPVs are found in genital secretions and skin shed-dings, which contain virus. Infected humans are the main source of infection. Asymptomatic shedding of viruses in body secretions facilitates transmission of infection to other human hosts. The infections are transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact and by genital contact. They are transmitted: most commonly by sexual contact (HPV-16, HPV-18); by direct contact through abrasions in the skin and mucosa; and by passage through infected birth canal as for laryngeal papilloma (types 6 and 11). Laboratory Diagnosis The diagnosis of wart is made by histopathological examina-tion. Demonstration of hyperplasia of the prickle cells and excessive production of keratin (hyperkeratosis) is diagnos-tic of the condition. Human papilloma virus infection can be detected by the demonstration of round coalesced cytotic squamous epithelial cells occurring in clumps in Papanicolaou smears. Cell cultures are not useful, because HPVs do not grow in cell lines. Serology is rarely used. The typing of virus isolates may be carried out by immunohistochemical detection of HPV structural proteins.Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are more sensitive techniques for detection of HPV in cervical swabs of tissue specimens. Treatment Warts are regressed during the course of time over a period of months to years. The warts can be removed by surgical cryo-therapy, electrocautery, or chemical reagents. Prevention and Control No specific preventive measures are available against HPV infection. Avoidance of direct contact with infected warts may prevent transmission. Safe sexual practice will be useful to prevent sexual transmission of HPV. Polyomaviruses Simian virus 40 (SV40) is the prototype polyomavirus studied extensively for eliciting different properties of the virus. The human polyomaviruses, such as BK and JC viruses, usually cause asymptomatic infection in humans. Polyomaviruses (poly, many; oma, tumor) are smaller viruses than papillomavi-ruses, measuring 45 nm in diameter. They are nonenveloped viruses with a 72-capsomere icosahedral capsid. Viral genome is a double-stranded DNA containing less nucleic acid, approximately 5000 bp. The genomes of poly-omaviruses (BK, JC, and SV40) are similar to each other. The genome is divided into early, late, and noncoding regions. The early region codes for nonstructural transformation pro-tein, while the late region codes for three viral capsid proteins, such as VP1, VP2, and VP3. The noncoding region contains the site of the origin of DNA for replication. Differences between HPV and polyomaviruses are summarized in Table 56-3. Different polyomaviruses show different host specificities. Human polyomaviruses, such as JC and BK, probably enter through the respiratory tract, and then subsequently infect lymphocytes and the kidneys. The BK viruses cause latent infec-tion of the kidney and of B cells. The pathogenesis of the human polyomavirus infection in humans depends on the immune status of the host. In the immunocompetent host, the replica-tion of viruses is inhibited. Suppression of immunity in patients receiving organ transplantation or suffering from AIDS results in reactivation of latent JC and BK viruses. In these patients, reactivation of viruses leads to shedding of viruses and symp-tomatic infection. The reactivation of BK viruses causes severe urinary tract infection with excretion of the virus in urine. Reactivation of JC viruses causes viremia and spread of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS), causing infection of the CNS. Chap-56.indd 471 IV the polyomaviruses (BK, JC, and SV40) are known to cause tumor in animals, such as hamsters. These viruses, how-ever, are not associated with any tumors in humans. Primary infection by human polyomaviruses is mostly asymp- tomatic in immunocompetent host. In immunocompromised host, the tissues are reactivated causing many serious diseases. Both JC and BK viruses are ubiquitous. Most people are infected by these two viruses by the age of 15 years. Both the viruses are probably transmitted by respiratory route. BK virus is associated with hemorrhagic cystitis in the bone marrow recipients. It also causes urethral stenosis in patients receiving kidney transplant. JC virus was first isolated from the brain of a patient with Hodgkin's disease, who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a subacute demyelin-ating disease of the CNS and is usually fatal. This disease occurs usually in immunocompromised patients including the patients with AIDS, Hodgkin's disease, and chronic lym-phocytic leukemia. The SV40 shows oncogenic potential in newborn hamsters, but is not associated with any human disease. The SV40, however, has a public health importance. Earlier, some batches of polio vaccines, which were prepared in the simian cell culture were contaminated with undetected SV40 virus in the primary monkey cell cultures. However, no SV40-related tumors have been reported so far, although many people were vaccinated with these SV40 contaminated polio vaccines. Electron microscopy is useful to detect JC virus in brain tissue from the cases of PML and from urine of kidney transplant recipients. Immunoperoxidase and in situ immunofluorescence are rapid detection methods for detection of viral antigen in brain tissue obtained by biopsy or at autopsy. BK polyomavirus is isolated from urine by culture in human diploid fibroblasts; JC virus is isolated from urine and brain tissue by culture in human fetal glial cell culture. Hemagglutination inhibition test is performed to differentiate these two viruses. No specific antiviral treatment is available for polyomavirus infections in humans. Prevention of polyomavirus infection is difficult due to ubiquitous presence of these viruses. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe and PCR are newer, sensitive methods for detec-tion of BK virus and JC virus in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, or biopsy tissue.Properties 8/H11003103 bp 5/H11003103 bp Coding information On one strand On both strands Oncogenic potential Yes Uncommon Result of natural infection Benign tumor Inapparent Target tissue Surface epithelia Internal organs Transform cells in vitro Rarely Yes Genome in transformed cells Episomal in warts; integrated in carcinoma Integrated Viruses infecting humans Human papillomavirus BK and JC viruses; SV40 Clinical syndromes warts laryngeal multifocal leukoencephalopathy and nephropathy in Differences between human papillomaviruses and human polyomaviruses A 35-year-old female commercial sex worker with history of sexual contact with many clients is diagnosed to be suffering from cervical cancer.

They exhibit many common features, such as similar morphology of virions, basic mode of replication in the host cells, and capability to establish latent and recurrent infections. All herpesviruses are structurally similar. The herpesviruses measure 120-200 nm in diameter. The virus has a characteristic morphology and consists of four distinct structural elements: ( a) DNA core, (b) capsid, (c ) tegument, and (d ) envelope. The DNA core consists of a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule with molecular weight varying from 125 to 229 kilobase pairs (kbp). The core is surrounded by an icosahedral capsid containing 162 capsomeres. This is enclosed by a glycoprotein-containing envelope. Between the envelope and capsid is an amorphous structure called tegu-ment, which contains viral proteins and enzymes that initiate replication. Envelope is the outermost component and is composed of lipids. It is derived from the modified host cell nuclear mem-brane through which the naked virions project during replica-tion. It carries surface spikes about 8 mm long. As enveloped viruses, the herpesviruses are sensitive to fat solvents, such as alcohol, chloroform, ether, and bile salts. Herpesviruses replicate in the host cell nucleus, and both replication and assembly occur in the nucleus. The herpes-virus encodes for several glycoproteins that facilitate viral Herpesviruses Subfamily Scientific name Common name Site of latency Alphaherpesvirinae herpesvirus 1 2 type 2 Neurons Varicella virus Neurons Gammaherpesvirinae Human lymphocytes in secretory Human herpesvirus 6 Human B cell lymphotrophic virus tissue Human herpesvirus 7 RK virus Lymphoid tissueTABLE 57-1 Classification of human herpesvirusesattachment, fusion, and immune evasion. The virus buds from nuclear membrane and is released by exocytosis and cell lysis. Classification Herpesviruses are ubiquitous. All human herpesviruses are included in the family Herpesviridae, which is divided into three subfamilies based on viral characteristics, pathogen-esis of the disease, and clinical manifestation of the disease (Table 57-1). At least eight important herpesviruses are known to cause infection in humans (Table 57-2). They are officially designated as human herpesvirus types 1-8, but the common names are still used. Herpes Simplex Virus Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are extremely host-adapted viruses that can cause a wide variety of illness in infected human hosts. There are two types of the HSVs: ( a) herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and (b) herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Both the types are closely related in their DNA homology, anti-genic determinants, and tissue tropism and disease symptoms, but differ in epidemiology. HSV-1 is transmitted primarily by contact with infected saliva, whereas HSV-2 is transmitted by sexual contact or by genital tract infection to newborn from an infected mother. Chap-57.indd 473 5/14/2012 12:24:22 PMSection IV Chapter 57474 VIROLOGY Properties the Morphology Herpes simplex viruses show following features: The HSVs like other herpesviruses are large, enveloped, icosadeltahedral viruses. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are structurally and morphologically similar. They, however, are distinguished antigenically by using type-specific monoclonal antibodies, restriction endonuclease patterns of their genome DNA, and the site of lesions. The virus contains a dsDNA. The genomes of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar in organization and show a higher degree of sequence homology. They, however, can be differentiated by restriction enzyme analysis of viral DNA. The unique feature of the DNA genome is that it encodes for as few as 80 polypeptides. Half of the proteins are required for replication of viruses, whereas other proteins help in interaction of the viruses with different host cells and immune response. HSV encodes for at least 11 glycoproteins that serve as (a) viral attachment proteins (gB, gC, gD, gH), (b) fusion proteins (gB), (c) struc-tural proteins, (d) immune escape proteins (gE, and gI), and (e) other fractions. Viral replication Herpes simplex virus (HSV) grows very rapidly in infected cells, requiring only 8-16 hours for completion. The virus infects most types of cells in human hosts and usually causes lytic infections of the fibroblasts and epithelial cells. After entry into the cell, the virion is uncoated, genome is released, and the genome DNA enters into the nucleus. The mRNA is tran-scribed by host cell RNA polymerase and then translated into early nonstructural proteins. Subsequently, the viral DNA poly-merase replicates the genome DNA, during which synthesis of early proteins is stopped but synthesis of late structural pro-teins begins. These late proteins are transported to the nucleus where assembly of virion occurs. The virion acquires its envelope by budding through the nuclear membrane. It also causes latent infections of neurons Human herpesviruses Diseases Herpes lymphoma, CMV infection in immunocompetent adult hosts HSV-6 sarcoma, body cavity lymphoma, and Castleman diseaseTABLE 57-2 Human infections caused by human herpesviruses by the presence of multiple copies of HSV-1 DNA in the cytoplasm of infected neurons. Other properties Like other enveloped viruses, HSVs are sensitive to treatment with acid, fat solvents, detergents, and drying. They are readily inactivated in the conditions prevalent in the gastrointestinal tract. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Chick embryo The virus grows on the chorioallantoic membrane of the embryonated egg and produces small, white, shining, non-necrotic pocks measuring less than 0.5 mm in diameter. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 show cross-reaction. Cell culture Herpes simplex virus grows in a variety of primary and contin-uous cell lines. The viruses grow readily on HeLa cells, Hep-2 cells, human embryonic fibroblasts, and rabbit kidney cells. Key Points HSV typically produces Cowdry type A acidophilic inclu-sion bodies, which are well-defined foci with heaped-up cells in the infected cell lines. Many strains of HSV also produce syncytial and giant cells in the infected cells. The virus kills the cells rapidly in tissue culture. A cell line that expresses beta galactosidase after infection with HSV is a new approach for isolation and identification of the virus in the cell lines. Addition of a chromotropic substrate allows the detection of enzymes in the infected cell. Pathogenesis and Immunity HSV shows three unique 57HERPESVIRUSES 475 Neurovirulence: The viruses have capacity to invade and multiply in the nervous system. Latency: Establishment and maintenance of latent infec- tion in the nerve cell ganglion is the unique property of the virus. HSV-1 affects most commonly the trigeminal ganglion, whereas HSV-2 affects the sacral nerve root ganglion (S2-S5). Reactivation: Reactivation and replication of latent HSV can lead to overt or covert recurrent infections and excretion of HSV. Reactivation can be caused by a variety of stimuli, including fever, trauma, emotional stress, sunlight, etc. In immunocompetent patients, HSV-1 reactivates more frequently in the oral cavity rather than on the genital parts, but HSV-2 reactivates eight to ten times more frequently in the genital parts as compared to orolabial infection. In immunocompromised patients, reactivation by either HSV-1 or HSV-2 is more frequent and more severe. The viruses cause disseminated infection in individuals with HIV-related disease and in people with impaired T-cell immunity, such as organ transplant recipients. Pathogenesis of herpes simplex virus infection Herpes simplex virus causes disease by direct cytopathologic effects. The infection is initiated by direct contact and depends on the infected tissues whether oral, genital, or brain, etc. The infection occurs by inoculation of virus into susceptible muco-sal surfaces, such as the oropharynx, conjunctiva, or cervix or through small abrasions on the skin. The viruses infect cells of ectodermal origin, the cells com- ing in contact with infected material, such as saliva or genital secretion. Viruses replicate at the site of entry in the skin or mucous membrane. The neuroinvasiveness (the ability of virus to invade the brain), neurotoxicity (ability to multiply in the brain and destroy the brain), and its latency (ability to remain in a nonreplicating stage in the dorsal root ganglia of the cen-tral nervous system, or CNS) are the properties of HSV that influence the course of infection in an infected host. The virus multiplies locally with cell-to-cell spread. The virus replicates in the infected cells at the base of the lesion and infects the innervating neuron. Subsequently, the viruses travel by retrograde transport to the ganglion, such as the trigemi-nal ganglion for HSV-1 and the sacral ganglion for HSV-2. The virus then returns back to the initial site of infection and may cause inapparent infection or produce vesicular lesions. Thin-walled umbilicated vesicles\u2014the roof of which breaks down, leaving tiny superficial ulcers\u2014are the typical lesions caused by HSV. These vesicles heal without forming any scars. The vesicle fluid contains infectious virions. After this retrograde axonal flow from neurons, the viral genomes become latent in the ganglia, particularly those of the trigeminal (HSV-1) and sacral (HSV-2) nerves. No viral par-ticles are produced during this phase of latency. Also, latent infection in neurons does not cause any demonstrable damage in neurons. This latency phase may be reactivated periodically in some individuals, causing recurrent oral and genital lesions. Various stimuli, such as physical or emotional stress, trauma, fever, and sunlight can induce a recurrence in which the virus travels back down the nerve, leaving lesions to develop at the skin, at the same spot each time. These stimuli trigger reactivation: by facilitating viral replication in the nerve, by inhibiting cell-mediated immunity (CMI) transiently, or by inducing both the mechanisms. Thus, recurrences or reactivation of infection can occur in the pres-ence of specific antibodies. However, the recurrent infections are more localized, less severe, and of short duration than the primary infection, due to presence of past memory immune responses. Host immunity Immunity is type specific, but some cross-protection may occur. In primary HSV infection, the immunity is characterized by the appearance of specific antibody responses within a few days, followed by a cellular immune response in the second or third week of infection. Humoral antibodies to HSV-1 increase with age, starting at childhood during which HSV-1 is usually acquired. Antibodies to HSV-2 appear in sexually mature adults, correlating with their degree of sexual activity. The antibodies usually do not prevent recurrence of disease, but reduce the severity of clini-cal disease. Immunity is incomplete, and both reinfection and reactivation occur in the presence of circulating antibodies. CMI plays an important role in conferring immunity to HSV infection and facilitates recovery from the infection. Hence, the virus tends to cause more frequent and severe infec-tions in the patients with altered CMI, such as HIV and other CMI-deficient diseases. Tissue damage occurring in HSV infection is due to a combi- nation of viral pathology and immunopathology. These immu-nopathologic effects of CMI and inflammatory responses are the major causes of symptoms seen during the disease. Clinical Syndromes Herpes simplex virus causes a wide variety of clinical manifes-tations. The clinical manifestations depend on (a) the age of patient, (b) immune status of the host, (c) previous immunity of the patient to autologous or heterologous viruses, (d) anti-genic type of the virus, and (e) anatomical site of involvement. Generally, HSV-1 produces the lesions above the waist, and HSV-2 produces lesions below the waist. HSV-1 infection is normally associated with orofacial infections and encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 is associated with genital infections. Primary infection with either virus is typically associated with systemic signs, prolonged duration, increased severity of illness, and more complications. HSV-1 infections HSV-1 can cause a wide variety of clinical entities. These include (a) acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, (b) acute gingivosto- matitis is the manifestation of primary HSV-1 infection occurring in children between 6 months and 5 years. Saliva from infected child or an adult is the source of infection. This condition has an incubation period of 3-6 days. The condition has an abrupt onset with high temperature. Gingivitis is the most impor-tant manifestation with marked lip swelling and erythematous and friable gums. Vesicular lesions appear on the oral mucosa, tongue, and lips. These lesions subsequently rupture and coalesce together, leaving behind ulcerated plaques. The acute disease lasts for 5-7 days, and the symptoms subside in 2 weeks. Viral sheddings from the saliva may continue for 3 weeks or more.Acute herpetic pharyngotonsillitis: HSV-1 causes pharyngi- tis and tonsillitis in adults more frequently than gingivostoma-titis. The condition manifests as fever, malaise, headache, and sore throat. The vesicular lesions on the tonsils and the pos-terior pharynx usually rupture to form ulcers. Associated oral and labial lesions can be found in less than 10% of the patients.Herpes labialis: Herpes labialis is the most common clinical manifestation of recurrent HSV-1 infection (Fig. 57-1, Color Photo 56). Pain, burning, and tingling sensation at the site of infection are presenting features. An intraepidermal vesicle that later becomes pustular and ulcerate is the typical lesion. Usually, two or less recurrences manifest each year in most patients. But in some patients, even monthly recurrence is seen.Herpes encephalitis: Herpes encephalitis is an acute febrile disease that is usually caused by HSV-1. This may be a manifestation of primary or recurrent infection with the virus. The infection may have an insidious or an abrupt onset. Focal neurological manifestations, such as seizures, hemiparesis, aphasia, and paresthesia may be seen during acute condition. In some patients, the infection may rapidly progress from stupor to coma to death, without having any localized neurological symptoms.Eczema herpeticum: Eczema herpeticum is seen in children with active eczema. The vesicular lesions appear briefly on previ-ous eczematous areas with extensive ulceration. Subsequently, the infection may be disseminated by blood to the adrenal glands, liver, and other organs, resulting in fatal consequences.Herpetic whitlow: Herpetic whitlow is an infection of the finger caused by entry of the virus through cuts or abrasions on the skin. The condition often occurs in doctors and nurses who are exposed to patients with HSV infection and to patients who have genital infection. The vesicular lesions are usually produced on the skin of the finger but may also be seen on the skin of the head and neck. HSV-2 infections HSV-2 causes (a) genital herpes, (b) neonatal infection, and (c) aseptic meningitis.Genital herpes: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 but can also be caused by HSV-1. The latter causes less than 10% of genital infections. Most primary genital infections are asymp-tomatic. The clinical manifestations of primary genital herpes caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 are similar, but recurrences are more common with HSV-2. In symptomatic men, the herpetic vesicles appear in the glans penis, the prepuce, shaft of the penis, and sometimes on the scrotum, thighs, and buttocks. Herpetic proctitis involv-ing the perianal area and rectum are seen in the persons who engage in anal intercourse. In women, the vesicles appear on the vesti-bule, and introitus. leaving behind extremely painful ulcers. Cervicitis, urethritis, and dys-uria may also be present in some women. In both men and women, the primary infection may be asso- ciated with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. In both the sexes, the ulcerative lesions persist from 4 to 15 days until crusting and re-epithelization occur. The virus continues to shed in the ulcerative lesions for more than 12 days. Recurrent genital herpes are more common with HSV-2 as compared to HSV-1. The condition is shorter in duration and less severe than the primary genital herpes. Recurrent genital herpes in men may present as one or more numbers of clustered vesicles on the shaft of the penis, prepuce, or glans. Relatively, pain is mild and urethritis is uncommon. The lesions heal in 7-10 days. In women, the vesicular lesions are found on the labia majora, labia minora, or perineum. These lesions are very painful. Fever and constitu-tional symptoms are uncommon. The lesions heal in 8-10 days.Neonatal infection: Neonatal infection is a most serious and usually fatal disease caused mostly by HSV-2. It usually occurs due to shedding of HSV-2 from the cervix during vaginal deliv- ery. It can also occur from an ascending in-utero infection dur-ing a primary infection of the mother. The infection can also be acquired postnatally from family members or hospital staff. Since CMI is poorly developed in neonates, the virus causes a disseminated disease with involvement of liver, lung, as well as the organs of the CNS. The condition has a high mortality of 80%. Progression of the infection to the CNS results in mental retardation or neurological disabilities even with treatment, or may finally lead to death.Aseptic meningitis: Aseptic meningitis may occur as a com- plication genital HSV-2 infection.

Chap-57.indd 476 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57HERPESVIRUSES 477 Differences between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections are sum- marized in Table 57-3. Epidemiology Herpes simplex viruses are distributed worldwide. Geographical distribution HSV-1 infection is more common than HSV-2 infection. By the age of 30 years, 80% individuals in high socioeconomic status and 80% in a low socioeconomic status are seropositive. Serum antibodies to HSV-2 begin to appear at puberty, cor-relating with degree of sexual activity. The HSV-2 infection is a major problem in the United States. It has been estimated that five of every 12 adults are infected with HSV-2. A total of 45 million individuals are infected, with up to 1 million newly infected people added every year. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Herpes simplex virus infections are exclusively human diseases. Humans are the only natural reservoirs. No vectors are involved in transmission of the disease. An infected person is a lifelong source and reservoir of the virus. Vesicle fluid, saliva, and vagi-nal secretions are the important sources of infection for both types of HSV. HSV-1 infection is transmitted orally through saliva. It is usually transmitted by oral contact, such as by kissing or by sharing of the toothbrushes or other saliva-contaminated items. The HSV infection can also occur following mouth-to-skin contact, with the virus entering through minor abrasions in the skin. Autoinoculation may also cause infection of the eye.Key Points HSV-2 HSV-2 is transmitted through sexual contact with infected person. The infection can also be transmitted from an infected mother to a child at birth and by autoinoculation. The virus is inactivated readily at room temperature and by drying; hence transmission by aerobes or fomites is most unusual. Children are at risk for acquiring HSV-1 infection, whereas sexually active people are at increased risk to HSV-2 infection. Medical and paramedical staffs on coming in contact with oral and genital secretions are at increased risk for acquiring herpetic whitlow. Immunocompromised individuals and neonates are at high risk for developing life-threatening disseminated disease. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include saliva, vesicle fluid, conjunctival fluid, corneal scraping, skin swab, skin scrapings, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Microscopy Light microscopy of the stained infected cell may show bal-looning of cells, ground glass nuclei and eosinophilic intra-nuclear inclusions, and multinucleated giant cells. Electron microscopy can be used for direct demonstration of virions in the negatively stained smears of the ganglia Sacral primary infection Young children Young adults Diseases: Vesicular lesions in the skin Above the waist Below the waist, especially the genitalia Gingivostomatitis Common Rare Pharyngotonsillitis Common Rare Keratoconjunctivitis the CNS Encephalitis Meningitis Infection in neonates Rare Skin lesions and disseminated infections Infection in immunocompromised hosts Dissemination to visceral organs No dissemination Transmission of infection Contact (often saliva) Sexual Growth on CAM Small pocks Large pocks Growth in chick embryo fibroblast Replicates poorly Replicates well Laboratory animals Less neurovirulent More neurovirulent Recurrence Less chance of recurrence More recurrence irrespective of site Resistance to antiviral agents in culture Less resistant More resistant HSV-1, herpes simplex virus detection Direct enzyme immunoassay and direct fluorescent anti-body test are useful to demonstrate HSV antigens directly in vesicular fluid, tissue smear, or biopsy. Isolation of the virus A definitive diagnosis of HSV infection is made by isolating the viruses in cell cultures.Cell culture: For culture, scrapings of skin vesicles and muco- sal lesions are collected, transferred immediately in a vial trans-port medium, and are carried to microbiology laboratory. After inoculation, HSV produces cytopathic effects (CPEs) within 1-3 cells, Hep-2 cells, and human embryonic fibroblasts. These cells become enlarged and appear ballooned. Some virus strains, particularly HSV-2, cause fusion of infected cells, leading to formation of syncytium. Immunofluorescent staining of infected tissue culture is useful to confirm the diag-nosis within 24 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a use-ful tool to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2. Isolated HSV can be typed by biochemical, immunological, and molecular methods. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis is of little value for diagnosis of primary HSV infection. It is mainly used for epidemiological studies. It is used only to determine postexposure to HSV. It is not useful for diagnosing recurrent infections because rise in antibody titer does not usually correlate with recurrent disease. Also, the serological tests cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies due to cross-reactivity. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe and PCR are useful for demonstration of viral genome directly in vesicular fluid, skin scraping, CSF, and other specimens for diagnosis of the disease. PCR shows a higher sensitivity (95%) for detection of HSV-1 DNA in the CSF specimen. PCR is also used to detect asymptomatic shedding or HSV in skin lesions, but is not cost-effective. PCR is also being increasingly used for diagnosing HSV infection of brain by examining the brain biopsy specimen. HSV-1 and HSV-2 types can be distinguished from each other by using (a) type-specific antibody, (b) DNA probe analysis, and (c) PCR. The DNA maps of restriction enzyme fragments of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are unique, hence can be detected or identified by DNA probe analysis and PCR. Other tests Histology Tzanck smear: It is useful for the cytological identification of viruses in the scraping obtained from the base of the vesicular lesion. In this procedure, the vesicular lesion is aseptically ruptured, and the base of the lesion is scrapped with a scalpel. The scraping from the base of the lesion is smeared on a glass slide, air dried, fixed, and usually stained with Giemsa or Wright stain. Demonstration of typical giant cell or Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusion bodies in the stained smear is diagnostic of HSV infection. This method shows variable sensitivity of 40-80% for diagnosis of HSV. Laboratory tests for diagnosis of HSV infections are summarized in Table 57-4. Treatment Herpes simplex virus infections are among other few non-HIV viral infections that can be treated with antiviral therapy. Treatment with specific antiviral chemotherapy is used to (a) prevent disease and recurrence, (b) treat the infection, and (c) to reduce the clinical course of infection.Acyclovir: It is a synthetic acyclic purine nucleotide analog, which is most commonly used to treat HSV infection. Acyclovir is useful: to diminish shedding of viruses, to decrease rate of clinical recurrences, and to suppress recurrent genital infections. Oral therapy with acyclovir is usually recommended for primary orolabial and genital HSV infections, which are non-life-threatening. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for life-threatening and serious HSV infections, such as encephalitis, infections in immunocompromised patients, and occasional severe orolabial or genital cases.Diagnostic methods Diagnostic features MicroscopyTzanck smear Presence of multinucleated giant cells with faceted nuclei and homogenously stained ground glass chromatin (Tzanck cells) Light microscopy and direct enzyme immunoassayHSV antigens on HeLa Hep-2 within 1-3 days SerologyELISA, CFT, and neutralization testNot useful for primary infection; only used for seroepidemiological studies Molecular diagnosisDNA probe and PCR Detects viral genome directly in vesicular fluid, skin scraping, CSF, and other specimens. Standard assay for specific diagnosis of HSV infections of the central nervous systemTABLE 57-4Laboratory tests for diagnosis of herpes simplex 57HERPESVIRUSES 479 Famciclovir and valacyclovir are other antiviral agents used against HSV. Prevention and Control Prevention of genital HSV infection is difficult because most transmission occurs during subclinical viral shedding. Nevertheless, abstinence from sexual intercourse while the patients have prodromal symptoms or lesions or use of con-doms may be useful. But these methods are not fully protec-tive. Prevention of transmission of HSV from mother to infant is also difficult due to presence of asymptomatic primary or recurrent genital infection. In such infected mothers, trans-mission can be prevented by avoiding vaginal delivery and instead delivering by caesarian section. At present, no vaccine is available for use against HSV. Herpesvirus Simiae: B Virus Herpesvirus simiae, recently designated as Cercopithecine her-pesvirus 1, was isolated in 1934 by Sabin and Wright from the brain of a laboratory staff, who died from ascending myelitis following bite by an apparently healthy monkey. This virus was named as B virus from the initial of the name of this patient. Since then many cases have been reported in the literature. Herpesvirus simiae is similar to HSV in many properties. These two viruses are antigenically related, though the anti-body against HSV does not protect against herpesvirus simiae infection. Herpesvirus simiae in monkeys usually causes asymptomatic infection. In symptomatic cases, it is associated with formation of vesicles on the buccal mucosa. The lesion ulcerates, shedding the viruses in the ulcer exudate. The infection in humans is usually acquired by bite of the monkeys. In some cases, it is acquired by handling infected monkey tissues. In humans, the disease is usually fatal. Neurological sequelae are seen in the patients who rarely sur-vive from the condition. Varicella Zoster Virus Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes Chickenpox is acquired by transmission from an infected host to a susceptible host, whereas herpes zoster occurs as a result of reactivation of the latent virus. Contact with a case of zoster or chickenpox may transmit chickenpox but not herpes zoster. Properties of the Virus Varicella zoster virus (VZV) shows following features: The virus has the smallest genome of all the human herpesviruses. It is an enveloped, dsDNA virus showing many similarities with the HSV. The virus like that of the HSV encodes an enzyme thymidine kinase and is susceptible to antiviral drugs. It produces char-acteristic blister-like lesions and also has the ability to cause latent infections of nervous and recurrent disease. However, unlike HSV, VZV is transmitted mainly by the respiratory secretions. VZV shows a replicative cycle similar to that of HSV. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Varicella zoster virus grows readily in cultures of human fibro-blasts, human amnion, or HeLa cells. These cell cultures show an apoptotic effect similar to that seen in HSV-infected cells, but the lesions are less marked than those produced by HSV. Also, the CPE appears after a longer incubation period. In culture, the viruses remain associated with the cells and are not found free in the media. The virus does not grow in chick embryos or in experimental animals. Pathogenesis and Immunity Chickenpox is the primary disease, whereas herpes zoster repre-sents reactivation of a previous infection. Pathogenesis of varicella zoster virus infections Primary VZV infection occurs in humans when the virus comes into contact with the mucosa of the respiratory tract or con-junctiva. From these sites, the virus enters the blood stream and lymphatic system to the cells of the reticuloendothelial sys-tem. After 11-13 days, a secondary viremia occurs and the virus spreads throughout the body and to the skin. In tissues, VZV spreads from cell to cell via direct contact to produce its effects. After primary infection, the virus migrates along the sen- sory nerve fibers to the satellite cells of the dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerve ganglia, where it becomes latent. This latency may be permanent, or the virus may become reactivated in old adults or in patients with impaired cellular immunity. On reac-tivation, the virus replicates and spreads along the nerve fibers to the skin, known as herpes zoster or shingles. Host immunity CMI is important in controlling the infection. It limits the pro-gression of the disease and results in early resolution of the dis-ease. The virus causes a disseminated life-threatening and more serious disease in immunocompromised patients with a defi-cient CMI. Depression of the CMI during life in the old age may cause recurrence of VZV and may cause herpes zoster. Humoral antibodies also play an important role by limiting the spread of the virus in the circulation. CMI also contributes to the immu-nopathology and symptomatology in the infected host. In some infected adults, it is responsible for more severe manifestations and more extensive cell damage than seen in children. Immunity following varicella is lifelong; the individual does not suffer from varicella again, but can suffer from herpes zoster despite having immunity to varicella. Immunity is in herpes zoster. Chap-57.indd Varicella causes following two clinical and (b) herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella childhood exanthemata along with measles, rubella, rubeola, and fifth disease. Chickenpox is a benign illness of the childhood, which is characterized by an exanthematous varicella rash that occurs following infection with VZV. Incubation period is about 2 weeks. The condition is nor- mally asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, the condition man-ifests as fever and maculopapular rash that progresses within a few hours to thin-walled vesicle on an erythematous base. This vesicle, which is the hallmark of chickenpox, is characteristi-cally surrounded by a red ring. The vesicle, which measures approximately 2-4 mm in diameter, becomes a pustule within 12 hours and begins to ulcerate, after which scabs appear. Successive crops of vesicles appear over 2-5 days and as a result at any given time all stages of the lesions are seen on the skin. Key Points The skin lesions are characteristically centripetal in distribution. They are more commonly present on the trunk than on the extremities. Typically, they are also present on the scalp. On the mucous membrane, lesions typically occur in the mouth, conjunctiva, and vagina. All these features help to distinguish chickenpox from many other exanthematous diseases. Secondary bacterial infection followed by scarring is the noted complication in the children. Primary infection in adults is generally more severe than in children. The vesicles heal more slowly; secondary bacterial infections and scarring are more common. The accompanying fever is more prolonged and higher. Interstitial pneumonia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and Reye's syndrome may occur in some of the patients. In pregnancy, VZV tends to cause more serious disease if the mother has not been infected during the childhood. The virus crosses the placenta and causes congenital infection in the fetus. Congenital malformation with hypoplasia of limbs, cho-rioretinitis, and scarring of skin are seen in the fetus infected during pregnancy. Herpes zoster Herpes zoster is a recurrence of latent varicella infection acquired many years earlier. This occurs due to reactivation of the VZV, which has remained latent in one or more sensory gan-glia following primary varicella many years earlier. The viruses travel down along the sensory nerve to produce painful vesicles in the areas of the skin (dermatome) innervated by the nerves from the affected ganglia. Severe pain in the area innervated by the nerve preceding the appearance of chickenpox-like lesion is the hallmark of the disease. The rashes are usually restricted to a dermatome. For example, if thoracic nerve supplies are affected, rashes appear most commonly on the chest walls. The rashes are distributed on the scalp and forehead when the ophthalmic nerve of trigeminal ganglion is affected. In more than 50% of the cases, the eye is affected, leading to corneal ulceration, anterior uveitis, and stromal keratitis. The accompanying pain and herpetic neuralgia is very much severe for up to a few weeks and occurs in about half of the patients over 60 years of age. The pain may persist for months, which may even require surgical ablation of the ganglion. Zoster of the seventh nerve ganglion may cause Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This is caused by reactivation of virus involving the facial and auditory nerves. Vesicular lesions may develop on the pinna, tragus, in the auditory canal, and on the tympanic membrane. The patient may have nystagmus, vertigo, or facial nerve palsy resembling Bell's palsy. Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syndrome caused by VZV. The condition is characterized by persistence of recurrent pain lasting 30 or more days after the acute infection. This con-dition occurs in more than 30% of patients, in the older people aged 65 years and above. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is the most serious and devastating form of acute herpes zoster (Color Photo 57). The condition occurs due to reactivation of the fifth cranial (tri-geminal) nerve. This condition may appear weeks to months after resolution of other symptoms. Postherpetic neuralgia and long-term sequelae are common in this condition.Varicella zoster virus infection in immunocompromised patients: The virus causes more lesions, and a progressive and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients and in neonates. The defective CMI in these patients facilitates rapid dissemination of the virus to the brain, lungs, and liver, thereby causing a fatal infection. The condition may occur fol-lowing primary infection by varicella or by reactivation of latent disease. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Varicella zoster virus is a highly infective pathogen distributed worldwide. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Chickenpox is exclusively a human disease. No animal reser-voirs are present. A chickenpox or herpes zoster patient is the source of infection. Varicella zoster virus is shed mainly in the respiratory secretions and also in the vesicular lesions of the skin. The infectivity is maximum during the early stage of the disease when the virus is shed in large numbers in respiratory secretions. The buccal lesions and vesicular fluid, which are rich in virus content, are highly infectious and are sources of infec-tion. Scabs do not contain any viruses, hence are noninfectious. Chickenpox is transmitted primarily by inhalation of respiratory secretions. The infection may also occur by direct Chap-57.indd 480 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57HERPESVIRUSES on the skin. Herpes zoster is a reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus infection, hence is not acquired from an infected patient. Chickenpox is mainly a disease of children. In herpes zos- ter infection, people of all ages are affected. The incidence of the disease, however, increases with age, due to the decrease in immune functions that occurs during aging. Laboratory Diagnosis In almost all the cases, diagnosis of chickenpox and herpes zoster is always clinical. Specimens These include skin lesion specimens, respiratory secretions, or organ biopsy. Direct antigen detection Direct fluorescent antibody test employing antibodies against viral membrane antigen (fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen; FAMA) is used to detect membrane antigen of the virus directly in the skin scrapings and biopsy specimens. The coun-tercurrent immunoelectrophoresis using zoster immune serum is also used to detect antigen directly in the vesicular fluid. Isolation of the virus Specimens from buccal or skin lesions collected during early stage of the disease are cultured on human amnion, human fibroblast, and HeLa or Vero cells. The VZV produces a CPE similar to that of HSV, but is less conspicuous and takes a long time to develop. Serodiagnosis Both indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay are employed to detect serum antibodies against VZV. These tests are useful mainly for epidemiological studies rather than for diagnosis of individual cases. Molecular Diagnosis PCR is a highly sensitive method for detecting of viral genome in skin scrapings or biopsy specimens. Other tests Histology: The Tzanck smear is useful to detect Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions and syncytia in VZV-infected cells. Treatment Antiviral drugs are available for treatment of VZV infections. These are acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir. Treatment with these agents is usually recommended for adults and immunocompromised patients with varicella infection and for patients with herpes zoster infections. Antiviral therapy is usu-ally not indicated for treatment of varicella infection in children.Prevention and Control Prevention of transmission of varicella infection in children is difficult. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin Varicella immunoglobulin from herpes zoster. High-risk peo-ple, such as immunosuppressed patients, are protected from serious disease by administration of varicella zoster immuno-globulin (VZIg). The immunoglobulin is also used for treat-ment of medical and paramedical personnel exposed to virus, as well as for treatment of newborns of infected mothers showing symptoms within 5 days of delivery. It is, however, not useful as a therapy for treatment of patients suffering from active vari-cella or herpes zoster disease. Vaccines A live attenuated varicella vaccine (Oka strain) is being used for protection against VZV. This vaccine was developed by Takahashi in Japan 1974 by attenuating strains of the varicella virus by serial passage in human and guinea pig fibroblast cell lines. The vaccine is given in a single dose for children aged 1-12 years and in two doses at 6-10 weeks' interval for older children. The vaccine is safe and protective. It stimulates the produc-tion of protective antibody and CMIs. The vaccine even confers protection in immunodeficient children. It is also used as a prophylactic agent for treatment of people even after exposure to VZV. Epstein-Barr Virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or human the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. Epstein-Barr virus is also the first virus known to be associated with human malignancies, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, other B-cell lym-phoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. It also causes other lymphoproliferative disorders in immunodeficient individuals. Epstein-Barr virus is a gamma herpesvirus belonging to subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. It shows very limited host specificity. Properties of the Virus Morphology Epstein-Barr virus shows following features: It is an enveloped DNA virus. It consists of a genome, a cap-sid, and an envelope. The genome consists of a 172 kbp, linear dsDNA. It is surrounded by an icosahedral capsid composed of capso-meres. Both the capsid PMSection IV Chapter 57482 VIROLOGY nucleocapsid, are enclosed by an envelope containing gly-coproteins. The envelope is derived from the outer nuclear membrane of host cell and contains many proteins, which are expressed for different types of infections. The viral capsid antigen (VCA) is the most important anti-gen present in the capsule and is of diagnostic importance. Neutralizing antibodies are produced against the viral membrane antigen. The early antigens (EAs), Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA), lymphocyte-determined membrane antigen, and viral membrane antigens are other antigens of diagnostic importance. The EBV enters B lymphocytes at the site of receptor for the C3 component of the complement. The virus replicates in cyto-plasm of the infected epithelial cells and the replicative cycle is similar to that of HSV. Antigenic and genomic properties Based on differences in the latency nuclear antigen genes, EBV consists of two types EBV-1 and EBV-2, also known as type a and type b strains, respectively. Both the types cause the same degree of clinical illness. They are prevalent throughout the world and can simultaneously infect the same person. Other properties Epstein-Barr viruses are sensitive to the action of ether and bile salts. They are relatively fragile and do not survive for a longer period outside the human body fluids. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility The virus can grow in human embryonic lung fibroblast cul-ture. The CPE produced by the virus is focal and is associated with refractile ballooning of the cells. The CPE unlike other viruses takes two or more weeks to develop. Pathogenesis and Immunity Epstein-Barr virus in humans can cause either of the following types of infections: 1. Primary infections by replication of viruses in B cells and epithelial cells. 2. Latent infection of B cells and presence of competent T cells. 3. Transformation of B cells to immortal plasmacytoid cells leading to malignancies. Pathogenesis of Epstein-Barr virus infection Epstein-Barr virus infection first occurs in the oropharynx and then spreads to the blood causing infection of B lympho-cytes. The virus is, therefore, present in large numbers in oro-pharyngeal secretions. Hence, the infection is most commonly transmitted through infected saliva often as a result of kissing. Therefore, the infectious mononucleosis is also commonly called as the kissing disease. Host immunity The virus infection induces a strong immune response, com-prising circulating antibodies against many virus-specific proteins, cell-mediated immune responses, and production of lymphokines. The humoral immunity is characterized by the appearance of IgM antibodies first against the viral membrane antigen, followed by the IgG antibodies, which persist for life. These antibodies against viral membrane antigen confer lifelong immunity against the second attack of infectious mononucleosis. The CMI plays an important role in controlling chronic infection and limiting primary infection. Clinical Syndromes EBV is associated with (a) infectious mononucleosis, (b) EBV-induced tumors, and (c) EBV infection in immunocompro-mised host. Infectious mononucleosis This is a clinical syndrome that represents the immunopatho-genic response of the host to infection with EBV. It is the classic syndrome associated with primary EBV infection in adolescents and young adults. EBV is the causative agent in approximately 90% of cases of acute infectious mononucleo-sis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is most commonly associated with EBV-negative cases of infectious mononucleosis. The condition is most often asymptomatic in children younger than 4 years. In symptomatic cases in adolescents and in adults, the condition is characterized by high fever, sore throat, headache, myalgia, nausea, and abdominal pain. The condition is associated with pharyngitis, generalized lymph-adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and fatigue. The symptoms are usually present for 2-3 weeks. But fatigue, which is the major complaint, continues to persist. Epstein-Barr virus infection rarely causes death in immu- nocompromised patients but may cause neurological compli-cations (meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, etc.), upper airways obstruction, or splenic rupture. Epstein-Barr virus-induced tumors Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with a number of tumors. Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma caused by EBV is a poorly differentiated monoclonal B cell lymphoma of the jaw. It is the most common tumor of childhood in Africa associated with both EBV and falciparum malaria. Plasmodium falciparum malaria causes stimulation and proliferation of polyclonal B cells in the presence of EBV infection. The malaria parasite also alters response of T lym-phocytes to EBV, apparently contributing to pathogenesis of the tumor. Chap-57.indd 482 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57HERPESVIRUSES 483 Key Points Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with nasopharyn-geal carcinoma endemic in Asia and is common in males of Chinese origin. EBV DNA can be demonstrated in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Epstein-Barr virus is also associated with Hodgkin's lym-phoma and most non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. EBV genome Reed Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus infection in immunocompromised host The virus causes most severe diseases in patients who are immunocompromised. In these patients, the EBV causes sev-eral syndromes and proliferation disorders including Duncan syndrome, ataxia telangectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and common variable immunodeficiency. Epidemiology Epstein-Barr virus infection occurs worldwide, but since it is not a reportable infection, the exact prevalence of infection is not known. Geographical distribution The viral infection is of relatively low transmissibility and does not occur as epidemics. It has been estimated that by age of 5 years, approximately 50% of the population in the United States is infected by EBV. The same appears to be true for other developed countries. In developing countries, 90% of children below 5 years are believed to experience an asymptomatic EBV infection. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Epstein-Barr virus infection is exclusively a human disease. Humans are the only known reservoirs of the virus. It is pres-ent in oropharyngeal secretion, saliva, peripheral blood, or lymphoid tissue of the infected human host. Saliva is the main source of infection. The saliva of people with active infection as well as people with reactivation of a latent infection constitute major source of infection. More than 90% of EBV-infected peo-ple intermittently shed the virus in their saliva throughout the life even when totally asymptomatic. The virus causes lifelong infection. The infection is transmitted by: saliva through close oral contact during the act of kissing; sharing of items, such as drinking glasses, cups, tooth-brushes, etc.; blood transfusion and by bone marrow transplantation, but rarely. The possible association of cofactors is suggested to play an important role in the geographical distribution of EBV-associated tumors. Malaria has been suggested as an important cofactor in the progression of chronic or latent EBV infection to acute Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa. The genetic predisposi-tion of the people in China or the presence of cofactors in the food or environment is believed to be important in facilitating the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in people living in certain parts of China. Immunocompromised people, such as patients with AIDS, transplant recipients, and genetically immunodeficient peo-ple are at high risk for lymphoproliferation disorders caused by EBV. Laboratory Diagnosis The laboratory diagnosis of EBV-induced infectious mononu-cleosis is based on the three classic criteria: Presence of lymphocytosis. Presence of at least 10% atypical lymphocytes in peripheral blood smear. Presence of heterophilic antibodies and antibodies to viral antigens. These criteria are supplemented by direct detection of viral antigens or EBV genomes in clinical specimens. Specimens These include lymphoid tissues, nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissue and saliva (for direct detection of viral antigens or EBV genomes), and blood (for serological tests) and peripheral blood (for blood smear). Direct antigen detection Direct immunofluorescent antibody using specific viral anti-bodies is used to detect EBV in clinical specimens. Isolation of the virus EBV can be isolated from saliva, peripheral blood, or lym-phoid tissue by transformation of normal human lympho-cytes obtained from umbilical blood. However, the procedure is tedious and time-consuming, hence seldom used. Attempt has also been made to culture \"spontaneously transformed\" B lymphocytes from EBV DNA or virus-infected patients. Serodiagnosis Epstein-Barr virus infection stimulates production of a wide range of antibodies including the heterophilic antibodies. These heterophilic antibodies are IgM antibodies that recog-nize Paul-Bunnell antigen on sheep, horse, and bovine RBCs. Therefore, serum from patients with acute mononucleosis agglutinates sheep, or bovine erythrocytes. Heterophile antibody test Paul-Bunnell test: Paul-Bunnell test was first described by Paul and Bunnell for demonstration of heterophile antibodies in patients with infectious mononucleosis in 1932. This heterophile antibody, which is an IgM antibody, is not directed Chap-57.indd 483 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57484 VIROLOGY against EBV or EBV-infected cells, but is produced due to polyclonal activation of B cells by EBV. Such heterophilic antibodies are also found in serum sickness during drug reaction and naturally occurring antibodies to the Forssman antigen. These antibodies are absent or present in a very low titer in serum of healthy individuals. The human blood to be tested is first absorbed by guinea pig kidney and then it is tested for agglutination activities that are directed against horse, sheep, or cow erythrocytes. The serum is inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and in dou-bling dilution is mixed with equal volume of a 1% suspension of sheep RBCs. The test is incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours and is examined for agglutination. A serum titer of 100 or greater is considered a positive test and is suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. Differential absorption of agglutinin with guinea pig and cow red cells is necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis. Cow RBCs absorb infectious mononucleosis heterophile anti-bodies from serum but not Forssman antibodies. Guinea pig kidney cells absorb Forssman antibodies, but not the infectious mononucleosis heterophile antibodies. Both guinea pig kidney cells and bovine RBCs absorb the antibodies produced in serum sickness. A serum titer of 1:100 after adsorption with guinea pig cells is considered positive and is suggestive of acute infectious mononucleosis. The heterophile antibodies are present in serum of 40-60% of patients with infectious mononucleosis in the first week of illness and in 80-90% of cases by the third or fourth week. These heterophile antibodies are usually present for 3 months but may persist for even as long as a year.Monospot test: Monospot test is a rapid slide agglutination test, which uses either horse RBCs or bovine RBCs. Bovine RBCs are more specific for acute infectious mononucleosis heterophile antibodies; hence they do not require differential absorption. Monospot test shows a specificity of 63-80%. It may show rare false positive reaction in patients with lymphoma or hepatitis.EBV-specific antibody tests Epstein-Barr virus infection is characterized by development of specific antibodies against different viral antigens, which appear during different stages of infection. Antibodies are pro-duced against viral capsid antigens (VCA), early Viral capsid anti-gen and membrane antigens are produced late in the lytic cycle, whereas EBNA is expressed in the latently infected cells. EAs are always expressed early in the lytic cycle. Indirect immunofluorescence test, ELISA, and Western blot are frequently used methods to detect antibodies against these antigens. Demonstration of IgM VCA antibodies as well as antibod-ies against EAs in the serum indicates current infection with EBV. Demonstration of IgG VCA antibodies indicates past infection. Demonstration of antibodies to EBNA antigens is also sug-gestive of past infection. Serological profile of EBV infections is summarized in Table 57-5. Other tests Complete blood count: Presence of atypical lymphocytes is the characteristic feature of infection with EBV. Usually 20-40% of lymphocytes are atypical. These atypical lympho-cytes of Downy type III are larger and have a less dense mucus than normal lymphocytes. Lymphocytosis (more than 50% lymphocytes) is seen in approximately 80-90% of patients. Lymphocytosis is well marked during the second or third week of illness and persists for 2-6 weeks. Treatment No specific treatment is available against acute infectious mononucleosis. Acyclovir has little activity against EBV; it may be useful in high doses for treatment of life-threatening EBV infections. Treatment of the condition is mainly symptomatic. Serological parametersPatient's clinical status Acute primary PMSection IV Chapter 57HERPESVIRUSES 485 Prevention and Control Prevention and control of infection is difficult due to wide-spread prevalence of the virus and intermittent shedding of the virus by the infected individuals throughout the life. Avoidance of contact with saliva and avoidance of kissing children on the mouth are some of the preventive measures. No vaccine is available against EBV infection. Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus or human herpesvirus 5 (HSV-5) of mononucleosis syndrome in symptomatic infec-tion in immunocompetent hosts. It causes pneumonia and more serious diseases in immunocompromised patients than in other individuals. The name is originated from the word cytomegalo (large cell virus) and is derived from the swollen cells containing large multinuclear inclusions that characterize these infections. Classification Cytomegalovirus is a member of the Betaherpesvirinae in the subfamily Herpesviridae. The virus shares similar common fea-tures in the structure, genome, and potency to cause latent and persistent infections like those of other herpesviruses. Properties of the Virus Morphology Cytomegalovirus shows following features: CMV is the largest herpesvirus measuring 150-200 nm in size. It has the largest genome of all the herpesviruses, ranging from 230 to 240 kbp. It is a double-stranded linear DNA virus with 162 hexagonal protein capsomeres surrounded by a lipid membrane. CMV is the only beta herpesvirus that has the only class E genome, similar to that present in HSV. Replicative cycle of CMV is similar to that of other herpesvirus, except that some of the immediate early proteins of the CMV are translated from mRNAs incorporated into the infected cells by the parental virion, but are not translated from the mRNAs synthesized in the newly infected cells. Antigenic and genomic properties Human CMV has a single serotype. It does not show any antigenic cross-reaction with CMV of other mammalian species. It shows only minor antigenic cross-reaction with simian CMV. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Human CMV replicates only in human cells. The virus grows only in diploid human fibroblast cell culture but not in epi-thelial cell culture. CMV grows very slowly in these cell lines, taking as long as 4-6 weeks to produce characteristic CPEs. The CPE includes foci of swollen refractile cells with cytoplasmic granules, which can be demonstrated by staining. In a stained smear, these cells show multinucleated giant cells containing acidophilic inclusions in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Pathogenesis and Immunity CMV is a lytic virus, which produces the CPE in vitro and in vivo. The pathogenesis of CMV infection is similar to that of other herpesviruses in many ways. Pathogenesis of CMV infection The virus infects the epithelial cells of the salivary glands, caus-ing a persistent infection and shedding of viruses in the salivary secretion. Activation and multiplication of the virus in the kid-ney and secretory glands facilitate secretion of CMV in urine and other body secretions including serum and milk. CMV infection is acquired by coming in contact with blood, tissue, and most body secretions containing viruses. On enter-ing the human host, CMV primarily affects epithelial cells and causes infection of those cells. Subsequently, CMV infection progresses to establish persistent and latent infection in T cells, macrophages, and other cells and in different organs, such as the kidney and heart. In the infected cells, CMV infection produces characteristic enlarged cells with viral inclusion bodies. This histopathologi-cal change, most commonly referred to as owl's eye, is considered diagnostic of the CMV infections. These histological findings, however, may be minimal or absent in infected organs. Host immunity Immunity to CMV involves both humoral immunity and CMI. CMI is more important and essential (a) for resolution of infec-tion and (b) also for controlling progression of CMV infection. The production of cytotoxic T cells against CMV is very crucial in CMI response to control the infection. CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes play an impor- tant role in protection after primary infection or reactivation of latent disease. Studies have shown that patients who do not develop CMV-specific CD4 or CD8 cells are at higher risk for developing CMV pneumonitis. Suppression of CMI, which is caused by therapy with corticosteroid or infection with HIV, induces reactivation of the latent viral infection. Recent Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe for Epstein-Barr early antigens has been used to detect and identify the EBV mRNA in the nuclei of EBV-infected lymphoid cells. PCR has been developed to detect EBV DNA in plasma during acute infectious mononucleosis. This EBV DNA levels decline during convalescence. They are not demonstrated in latently infected individuals. Chap-57.indd 485 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57486 VIROLOGY studies have also shown that many viral gene products appear to modulate host inflammatory response and are responsible for symptoms of the disease. The humoral immunity is characterized by development of CMV IgM antibodies during 4-7 weeks of infection. These neutralizing antibodies are directed mostly against an envelope glycoprotein gB. More than 50% of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum are found to be produced against glyco-protein gB. Antibodies are also produced against other viral proteins, such as pp153, pp28, and pp65. The antibodies have some role in control of severe disease, but do not prevent trans-placental infection, which can occur even in pregnant mothers who are CMV seropositive. Clinical Syndromes CMV causes (a) congenital CMV acquired CMV infection, (c) CMV infection in immunocompromised patients, and (d) CMV infection in immunocompetent adult hosts. Congenital CMV infection CMV is the most common viral cause of congenital infection. The infection is acquired by fetus by transmission of virus through placenta from mother's blood. The infection can also be an ascending infection from the cervix of the mother during recurrence of infection. The congenital infection may be classi-fied as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Asymptomatic congenital CMV infection occurs in infants born to women who have preexisting immunity to CMV. These infants appear normal at birth but are at risk of developing growth retardation and other neurodevelopmental abnormali-ties during later stage of life. Cytomegalic inclusion disease is the manifestation of the symptomatic congenital CMV infection, which usually occurs in women who acquire primary CMV infection during preg-nancy. The disease is characterized by microcephaly, intrace-rebral calcification, hepatosplenomegaly, and rash. Mental retardation and unilateral or bilateral hearing loss are the most common consequences of cytomegalic inclusion disease in adults. Approximately, 10% of affected infants show clinical evidence of disease at birth. Acquired CMV infection Acquired CMV infection occurs postnatally as follows:Perinatal CMV infection: This condition usually occurs following exposure to infected genital secretions in the birth canal or to milk during breast feeding. Most perinatal infec-tions are asymptomatic. Some infants may manifest lymph-adenopathy, hepatitis, and pneumonitis. However, these patients do not show any neurological or neurodevelopmental complications.CMV mononucleosis: CMV mononucleosis is a disease of young adults acquired by person-to-person transmission. This condition is transmitted by blood transfusion or organ trans-plantation. Fever and severe malaise are typical symptoms. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish CMV mononucleosis from EBV-induced mononucleosis.Transfusion-acquired CMV infection: This condition occurs following transfusion of infected blood after an incubation period of 20-60 days. This condition is mostly asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, clinical manifesta-tions of transfusion-acquired CMV are to CMV mononucleosis. CMV infection in immunocompromised host CMV is the most important opportunistic agent in immuno-compromised hosts, in whom it causes a variety of clinical syn-dromes. These include life-threatening intestinal pneumonitis, gastrointestinal diseases, retinitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, and varieties of other CMV syndromes. Patients receiving organ transplants are severely affected by the disease. CMV infection in immunocompetent adult hosts CMV produces mononucleosis syndrome, a condition similar to EBV-induced mononucleosis in immunocompetent adult hosts. CMV is a sexually transmitted disease. The infection is transmitted by contaminated genital secretions. Epidemiology CMV infection is worldwide. Geographical distribution Many serological surveys have shown CMV to be present in 42-100% of the people depending on socioeconomic condition. In developing countries, infection of children is most common with a seroprevalence for CMV to be 100% very early in child-hood. In developed countries, infection of the young adults is more common; more than 50% of young adults are seropositive in many developed countries. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the natural hosts. An infected human is the only reservoir of CMV infection. No animal reservoirs are pres-ent for this virus. Cytomegaloviruses are found in the urine, blood, saliva, tears, throat swab, stool, semen, milk, amniotic fluid, cervical and vaginal secretions, and tissue obtained for transplantation. Saliva, tears, urine, and breast milk are the common sources of infection for baby or child. Cervical secretions are the source of transmission of infection to neonates. Blood, organ graft, and semen are the other sources of infection in adult popula-tion. Transmission of CMV occurs in a variety of ways: Early in life, infection is transmitted to infants through the placenta, through infected birth canal, and also through breast milk. Infection to young children is most commonly transmitted by saliva. Chap-57.indd 486 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57HERPESVIRUSES 487 In adults, infection is transmitted sexually through semen and cervical secretions. Infection is also transmitted through the blood transfusion and organ transplantation. CMV causes latent infection; hence reactivation may result in disease in patients who are immunocompromised. These patients include those with HIV and those receiving organ and bone marrow transplantation. Immunodeficiency caused by antineoplastic compounds and ionizing radiation may also cause reactivation of CMV infection. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Different body secretions, such as saliva, urine, throat washing, blood, CSF, cervical secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tissue bits are the specimens that can be used for the culture. Direct antigen detection Direct immunofluorescence test using specific fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies has been used to detect CMV pp65 and pp67 proteins of the virus directly in the clini-cal specimens, such as blood leukocytes. These proteins are typically expressed only during replication of the virus in the tissues. Key Points Antigen detection tests are very useful for detection of sub-clinical disease in immunocompromised patients at high risk. These are also useful to initiate specific antibiotic therapy in transplantation. Isolation of the virus Cell culture is the definitive method for establishing diagno-sis of CMV infection. Body fluids or organ tissues are usually cultured on human diploid fibroblast cell lines and are incu-bated for development of the characteristic CPEs for at least 4-6 weeks.Shell vial assay: Though cell culture is highly sensitive, but takes a longer time of 4-6 weeks for identification of virus. To avoid that, shell vial assay is carried out for rapid detection of viruses. This is an adaptation of tissue culture, which pro-vides result more rapidly. In this method, the clinical speci-men is added to a vial containing a monolayer of cell line. The shell vial is centrifuged at a low speed and incubated for 24-48 hours. The tissue culture medium is removed, and the cells are stained using fluorescent-labeled anti-CMV antibod-ies and examined by a fluorescent microscope. The positive shell vial assay is the presumptive evidence of active CMV infection and has been found to be as sensitive as traditional tissue culture. Serodiagnosis ELISA is a frequently used test to detect CMV IgM antibodies developed early during the course of illness and during reac-tivation of latent CMV infection. A fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer is diagnostic. The serology is useful for primary CMV infection, but not reliable for diagnosis of congenital CMV infection. Molecular Diagnosis PCR has been developed to detect CMV DNA in tissue or body fluids, such as spinal fluid and amniotic fluid. The test is highly sensitive and becomes positive even before the viremia in those who are receiving organ transplants. Other tests Histology: The presence of an enlarged cell that contains a dense, central owl's eye and basophilic intranuclear inclusion body is the characteristic feature of the cell infected by CMV. These cells are found in most tissues of the body and in the urine. These inclusion bodies can be readily seen on staining with hematoxylin-eosin or Papanicolaou's staining. These cells are found in most tissues of the body and in the urine. Treatment Ganciclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of CMV. It is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA synthesis and also has activity against HSV, VZV, and human herpesviruses 7 and 8. Ganciclovir treatment is useful for gastrointestinal disease in patients who have received organ transplants and also those who are HIV positive. Ganciclovir has also been used as a prophylactic treatment of CMV disease in patients who have received transplants. This is given to all patients who have posi-tive finding on serology and also to those who show evidence of ongoing replication. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are the major adverse effects associated with ganciclovir therapy. In addition, foscarnet is another drug, which has been used to treat the infection that is resistant to ganciclovir. Prevention and Control Sexual transmission of CMV can be prevented by following safe sexual practices, such as using condoms. Transmission of virus is also reduced by regular screening of blood and organ donors for CMV seronegativity. Prophylaxis with ganciclovir prevents reactivation of latent CMV infection in immunocompromised patients. No vaccine is available for CMV. Human Herpesvirus 6 Human herpesvirus 6 (HSV-6) was first isolated from the peripheral blood of patient with AIDS in the year 1986. HSV-6 like EBV and CMV is lymphotrophic and ubiquitous. Chap-57.indd 487 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMSection IV Chapter 57488 VIROLOGY is believed to persist chronically in salivary gland tissue in some of the adults. The virus is spread by the saliva, which is the main source of infection. Like other herpesviruses, HSV-6 causes a latent infection in T cells and monocytes. The replication of the virus in CD4/H11001 T lymphocytes is controlled by CMI. The reac-tivation of the virus occurs in immunocompromised patients (patients with AIDS or other immunosuppression disorders). HSV-6 causes roseola infantum, a febrile infection that affects young children. The virus may also cause mononucleosis syn-drome and lymphadenopathy. Human Herpesvirus 7 Human herpesvirus 7 (HSV-7) was first isolated from periph-eral CD4 cells of healthy persons in 1990. HSV-7 like HSV-6 has also been isolated from saliva of healthy adults and has been implicated as one of the causative agents of rubeola infantum and febrile seizures in children. The virus has also been associated with acute hemiplegia of childhood, hepatitis, and respiratory tract infections. Human Herpesvirus 8 Human herpesvirus 8 (HSV-8) is associated with Kaposi's sar-coma and also with body cavity lymphoma and Castleman disease. DNA sequences of HSV-8 have been identified in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. This virus, also known as KS-associated herpesvirus, is believed to be important in causing and/or maintaining lesions in Kaposi's sarcoma. The lesion in Kaposi's sarcoma begins as red purple or dusky area that enlarges into a plaque and progresses subsequently into a tumorous growth. T-is condition is observed most commonly in immunosuppressed patients but also occurs in children, although rarely. A 21-year-old college student attended medicine OPD with history of sore throat, low-grade fever for several days, followed by swollen cervical lymph nodes and increasing fatigue. Blood film examination revealed lymphocytosis with atypical cells. The serum for heterophile antibodies was positive by Paul-Bunnell test. Name the most likely diagnosis of the condition. What are the other laboratory tests that can be performed to diagnose the condition? Describe the methods of transmission of the condition. Describe the preventive measures for the condition.CASE STUDY Chap-57.indd 488 5/14/2012 12:24:24 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 58 Introduction Adenoviruses cause a variety of sporadic and epidemic dis-eases in humans including acute respiratory disease, pharyn-goconjunctival fever, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, acute hemorrhagic cystitis, and more recently adenoviral infections in immunocompromised hosts. Of most recent interest is the role of adenoviruses as vectors in gene therapy. The virus is being used to deliver DNA for gene replacement therapy in few genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis. Adenovirus Classification Adenoviruses belong to the family Adenoviridae, which consist of a group of medium-sized, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that multiply in the nucleus of the infected cell. The family consists of two distinct genera: Mastadenovirus and Aviadenovirus consisting of mammalian and avian adenovi-ruses, respectively. The genus Mastadenovirus comprises at least 49 serotypes, which infect humans. All these human serotypes have been divided into six groups (A-F) on the basis of their DNA homology and other physical, chemical, and biologic properties (Table 58-1). Properties of the Virus Morphology Adenoviruses show following are double-stranded 80-110 diameter. The adenovirus genome is a linear double-stranded DNA with terminal protein. DNA contains terminal incorporated lipids of more than 100 base pairs, rendering the single-stranded DNA to form pan-handle-shaped molecules. The viruses have icosahedral nucleocapsid with a diameter of 70-90 nm. Adenoviruses have a characteristic morphology. They are the only viruses having a fiber protruding from each of the 12 vertices of the capsid. The capsid is composed of 252 capsomeres, which con-sist of hexons and pentons. Of these 252 capsomeres, 240 hexons make up the 20 triangular faces of icosahedron and 12 pentons form the bases. An apical fiber, 9-31 nm in length and 62 kDa in molecular mass, projects from each penton. This apical fiber helps to bind specifically adenoviruses to receptor sites on the host cells. The fiber contains the viral attachment proteins and can act as a hemagglutinin. The penton base and fiber are toxic to cells. The type-specific antigens are present in the pentons and also in the fibers. Viruses encode proteins to promote messenger RNA (mRNA) and DNA synthesis including its own DNA polymerase. Viral replication Adenoviruses attach to surface of the cells by their fibers, then penetrate the cell, and once inside the cell, uncoat the viral DNA. The viral DNA is then transported into the nucleus of the cell and initiates replication cycle. Host cell DNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the early genes leading to formation of functional mRNA. Then in the cytoplasm, the early mRNA is translated into nonstructural proteins. In the nucleus, after viral DNA replication, late mRNA is transcribed and then translated into structural virion proteins. This is followed by assembly of virions in the nucleus and release of virions by lysis of the cells, but not by budding.Adenoviruses Groups Serotypes Hemagglutination with red cells Oncogenicity in hamsters Transformation of cells A 12, 18, 31 Rat (partial) High /H11001 B 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 21, 34, 35 Monkey (complete) Weak /H11001 C 1, 2, 5, 6 Rat (partial) None or low /H11001 D 8-10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22-30, 32, 33, 36-39, 42-47Rat (complete) None but can transform cells /H11001 E 4 Rat (partial) None or low /H11001 F 40, 41 Rat (partial) None /H11001TABLE 58-1 Classification of human adenoviruses and genomic properties Viral group-specific antigen is present on the inner surface of hexon capsomere. These group antigens can be detected by immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Type-specific antigen is located on other region of the hexon and on the fiber. The fiber protein is the main type-specific antigen. Fiber determinant (gamma) is a type-specific hemagglutinin. Serotypes are identified by neu-tralization test. Key Points Human adenoviruses are classified into six groups (A-F), also called subgroups or subgenera based on the properties, such as (i) DNA fragment analysis, (ii) fiber length hemagglutina-tion, and (iii) oncogenic potential. These subgroups are further classified into 49 different serotypes based on the differences in their penton bases and fiber proteins, which determine the nature of tissue tropism and disease. Other properties Adenoviruses are relatively stable and remain viable for about a week at 37/H11034C but are readily inactivated at 50/H11034C. They are resistant to ether and bile salts. They resist drying, detergents, gastrointestinal tract secretions including acid, protease, and bile, and even mild chlorine treatment. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Human adenoviruses are highly host specific; hence laboratory animals are not susceptible to infection by the virus. Cell culture Human adenoviruses can be grown only in tissue cultures of human origin. They grow well on monolayer of HeLa, Hep-2, KB, and human embryo kidney cells. Cytopathic changes are observed after 1-4 weeks of inoculation and consist of cell rounding and aggregation into grape-like clusters. Infected cells swell, become ballooned, and show intranuclear inclu-sions in stained preparations. Pathogenesis and Immunity Tissue tropism of the specific groups or serotypes of adenovirus strain determine the type of disease caused by adenoviruses in humans. Pathogenesis of adenovirus infections Adenoviruses are transmitted mainly by respiratory or feco-oral contact between humans. They infect the conjunctiva or the nasal mucosa. They may multiply in conjunctiva, pharynx, or small intestine, and then spread to preauricular, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes, where epithelial cells are infected. Adenoviruses may cause three different types of interaction with the infected cells. These are (a) lytic infection, (b) latent infection, and (c) transforming infection.Lytic phase: Adenoviruses infect mucoepithelial cells in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and conjunctiva or cor-nea, causing damage of these cells directly. After local replication of the virus, viremia follows with subsequent spread to visceral organs. Dissemination occurs more commonly in immunocom-promised patients than in the immunocompetent individuals.Latent infection: The adenovirus has a unique ability to become latent in lymphoid and other tissues, such as adenoids, tonsils, and Peyer's patches. The exact mechanism of latency of adenoviruses in these tissues is not known. These latent infec-tions can be reactivated in patients infected with other agents or in the patients who are immunocompromised.Oncogenic transformation: Some adenoviruses belonging to groups A and B have the property for oncogenic transforma-tion in rodent cells. During oncogenesis, the multiplication of adenovirus is inhibited followed by integration of viral DNA into the host DNA. After integration, adenoviruses produce EIA proteins, which target rodent cells by altering cellular transcrip-tion, finally leading to transformation of rodent cells. However, oncogenesis of human cells has not been demonstrated. Host immunity Adenovirus infection is characterized by development of an effective and long-lasting immunity against reinfection. Both cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral immunity are important. CMI plays an important role in limiting prolifera-tion and outgrowth of adenoviruses. Therefore, different dis-ease is seen in persons whose CMI is immunocompromised. Serum antibodies play an important role for resolving ade-novirus infection. Resistance to clinical disease is believed to be directly related to the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies. The antibodies protect the person from reinfection with the same serotype but not other serotypes. Moreover, ade-novirus infection confers lasting immunity to reinfection with the same serotype. Clinical Syndromes Adenoviruses primarily infect children. Adults are also infected. Certain serotypes of adenovirus are associated with specific syndromes. Respiratory infections are caused by low-numbered serotypes (1, 2, 3, 5, and 7) and gastrointestinal infection by high-numbered serotypes (40, 41, 42) (Table 58-2). Incubation period varies from 5 to 8 days. Major clinical syndromes caused by the human adenoviruses are as follows: Respiratory diseases Acute respiratory disease: This disease is caused by adeno-virus serotypes 4 and 7. Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, and sore throat are the typical symptoms, which last for 3-5 days. This syndrome most often affects military recruits living in crowded conditions.Pharyngoconjunctival fever: This syndrome occurs primarily in school-going children. Fever, sore throat, coryza, and red eye are the classic presentations of the condition. These symptoms Chap-58.indd 490 5/14/2012 12:23:48 PMSection IV Chapter 58ADENOVIRUSES 491 may precede ocular findings, or they may not be present. Acute conjunctivitis may occur as a separate entity with or without pharyngitis. The condition is usually self-limiting. This condi-tion is caused predominantly by serotypes 3, tract diseases: Bronchiolitis, croup, lar- yngitis, and cold-like symptoms are the other respiratory tract diseases caused by adenoviruses. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis This is a highly contagious condition and has an insidious onset of unilateral red eye. Subsequently, both the eyes are involved. Patients complain of photophobia, tearing, and pain. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present in some children. Inflammation of the conjunctiva may persist for a week, accom-panied with residual scarring and visual impairment. The con-dition may occur as an epidemic, which is usually caused by serotype 8 and less often by serotypes 19 and 37. Gastroenteritis and diarrhea These conditions are most commonly associated with serotypes 40 and 41, but other serotypes may also be involved. The enteric adenovirus infection is a common cause of infantile diarrhea in day-care centers. The condition manifests as fever and watery diarrhea, which resolves within 1-2 weeks. Other manifestations Adenoviruses have also been associated with acute hemor-rhagic cystitis caused by serotypes 11 and 21, intussusception in young children, pertussis-like illness, musculoskeletal disor-ders, and genital and skin infections. Adenovirus infections in immunocompromised host These infections are caused by multiple serotypes of adeno-viruses. These serotypes cause disease during the posttrans-plant period in the patients who have received hematopoietic Disease Serotypes Acute respiratory disease 4, 7, 14, 21 Acute febrile pharyngitis Endemic Epidemic1, 2, 5, 63, 4, 7 Pneumonia 1-3, 7 Pharyngoconjunctival fever 3, 4, 7 Acute follicular conjunctivitis 3, 4, 11 Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 19, 37 Gastroenteritis and diarrhea 40, 41 Intussusception 1, 2, 5 Acute hemorrhagic cystitis 11, 21 Disseminated infection 5, 34, 35, 43-47TABLE 58-2Diseases associated with various serotypes of adenovirusesstem cell transplant. Patients receiving stem cell transplanta-tion and with T-cell deletion and lymphopenia are at risk for serious adenovirus infections. Infections in these patients may cause variable manifestations, but include hemorrhagic cystitis, pneumonia, nephritis, and gastroenteritis. Infection occurs either by reactivation of old infection or by exogenous transmission from other infected hosts. Adenovirus serotypes associated with various human illnesses are summarized in Table 58-2. Epidemiology Adenovirus infections are found worldwide. Geographical distribution More than one serotypes of virus may produce the same clinical syndrome, and one serotype of virus may cause clinically dif-ferent diseases. Adenoviruses 1-7 are the common serotypes worldwide and are responsible for most cases of adenovirus-associated infections. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Adenovirus infections are exclusively human infections. No animal reservoirs are present. Infected symptomatic as well as asymptomatic humans who excrete adenoviruses intermit-tently in their respiratory secretions and also in their stool are the sources of infection. The infection is transmitted from person-to-person directly by aerosol droplets, feco-oral route, direct inoculation of conjunctiva by contaminated fingers, contaminated fomites including towels and medical instru-ments, and swimming in improperly disinfected swimming pool. Overcrowding, poor hygiene, and close contact facilitate trans-mission of infection. Adenovirus typically affects children, starting from infants to school-going ones, though children of any age may be affected. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Specimens used depend on the nature of the clinical illness caused by adenoviruses. These include throat swab, nasopha-ryngeal aspirate, Certain serotypes of enteric adenoviruses may be seen directly in stool specimens by electron microscope. These serotypes (40, 41, 42) are difficult to grow in cell cultures, hence are referred to as noncultivable adenoviruses. Chap-58.indd 491 5/14/2012 12:23:48 PMSection IV Chapter 58492 VIROLOGY Direct antigen detection ELISA or direct fluorescent antibody test using specific anti-bodies raised against adenoviruses is used to detect viral anti-gen in feces and nasopharyngeal secretions. Isolation of the virus Isolation of the virus by cell culture establishes the specific diagnosis of the condition. Viruses from clinical specimens may be isolated on primary human embryonic kidney cells, HeLa, Hep-2, and KB cells. The viruses within 2-20 days pro-duce a lytic infection with characteristic inclusion bodies. Primary human embryonal kidney cells support growth of many fastidious adenoviruses. The viral antigens in the cell cul-ture can be detected by direct immunofluorescent test using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The viral isolates are usually classified into subgroups by hemagglutination with rat and monkey erythrocytes. Further serotyping is carried out by neutralization test. Serodiagnosis Serology is rarely used for diagnosis of the cases. It is usually used for epidemiological studies. They are also used to confirm causative role of a fecal or respiratory tract isolate by identify-ing its serotype. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to identify enteric adenovirus serotypes 40, 41, and 42 directly in stool specimens, which do not grow in cell cultures. These methods are also used to detect, type, and group adenovirus isolates in tissue culture and stool specimens.Treatment At present, no specific antiviral agents are available for treatment of adenovirus infections. Ribavirin has been used with variable success in treatment of adenovirus infections in immunosuppressed hosts. Vaccines Three live, nonattenuated vaccines against serotypes 4, 7, and 21 are available for use as oral vaccines. Each of the three vaccines is monovalent, and each vaccine contains only one serotype. These vaccines are given orally in a gelatin-coated capsule, which protects the live virus from inactivation by stomach acidity. The virus is released in the intestine, where it rep-licates and induces neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine strain does not spread from person to contacts. The vaccine is available for only military recruits in the United States and is not available for civilian use. Adeno-Associated Viruses Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are small, icosahedral viral particles measuring 20-25 nm in diameter. They are so called because they can multiply only in cells simultaneously infected with adenovirus, but cannot multiply independently because they lack enough DNA. These viruses have been classified in the genus Dependovirus. Four serotypes (1-4) have been recog-nized, of which types 1, 2, and 3 are of human origin and type 4 is of simian origin. The pathogenic role of the human sero-types of AAVs is not clear. A 3-year-old child in a nursery school suffered from a mild respiratory tract infection. Subsequently, many other children studying in the same nursery also suffered from the same illness. A viral infection is suspected. Name the adenovirus types frequently associated with this illness. List other types of adenoviruses and the diseases caused by them. Describe the laboratory methods for diagnosis of the condition. Describe the vaccines available against the condition.CASE STUDY Chap-58.indd 492 5/14/2012 12:23:48 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 59 Introduction Parvoviruses are the smallest of the DNA viruses belonging to the family Parvoviridae. They are icosahedral, nonenvel-oped viruses containing a single-stranded DNA. Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is the only known parvovirus that is pathogenic for humans, and it shows tropism for erythroid progenitor cells. Classification The family Parvoviridae consists three genera: Dependovirus, Parvovirus, and Erythrovirus. The genus Dependovirus consists of poxviruses, which are defective and replicate only in association with a second helper virus. They neither cause illness by themselves nor alter the infec-tion caused by helper viruses. These are usually found in association with an adenovirus, hence are known as adeno-associated viruses. These viruses do not cause any disease in humans. The genus Parvovirus includes animal viruses of veterinary importance, such as feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvovirus. The genus Erythrovirus consists of B19, the only member of the Parvoviridae family known to cause disease in humans. The diseases associated with B19 are summarized in Table 59-1.Parvoviruses TABLE 59-1 Human infections caused by B19 virus Disease Manifestations Flu-like illness Malaise, Infection in pregnant in a no adverse effects; nonimmune mothers: hydrops infection Chronic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia Transient acute (\"fifth disease\"\u2014it was fifth of the six classified exanthematous diseases of childhood), a mild viral illness of children, and polyarthralgia-arthritis syndrome in immuno-competent adults. Properties of the Virus Morphology B19 viruses show the following properties: B19 viruses are extremely small viruses, measuring 18-26 nm in diameter. They possess a nonenveloped, icosahedral viral genome contains a single-stranded 4000-6000 bases in length. The genome is negative-strand DNA, but there is no virion. The genome encodes for many proteins, which include three structural, one major nonstructural, and several smaller proteins. Viral replication B19 virus shows tropism for (a) bone marrow cells, (b) erythroid cells from fetal liver, and (c) erythroid leukemia cells. Replication of virus occurs in the nucleus. The single-stranded DNA genome has hairpin loops at both of its ends, which facil-itate double-stranded areas for the cellular DNA polymerase to start synthesis of the progeny genomes. The cellular RNA polymerase synthesizes viral mRNA from the double-stranded DNA intermediate. This is followed by assembly of virions in the nucleus. Viral replication results in cell death. Antigenic properties Only one serotype of B19 virus is known to occur. Other properties B19 virus is highly resistant to inactivation but can be inacti-vated by formalin, beta propiolactone, and oxidizing agents. The viruses withstand heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and are stable between pH 3 and 9. Chap-59.indd 493 5/14/2012 5:51:45 PMSection IV Chapter 59494 VIROLOGY Pathogenesis and Immunity B19 virus shows a tropism for two types of cells: (a ) red blood cell (RBC) precursors and (b ) endothelial cells in the blood vessels. Pathogenesis of parvovirus infections The virus infects rapidly dividing erythrocyte precursors, such as bone marrow cells, erythroid cells from fetal liver, and ery-throid leukemia cells, and destroys these cells after infection, thereby causing aplastic anemia. Infection of the endothelial cells in the blood vessels leads to erythema infectiosum. It has been demonstrated that the B19 virus first enters through the nasopharynx or upper respiratory tract and then spreads to the blood, causing viremia. The virus then infects mitotically active erythroid precursor cells in bone marrow and establishes the infection. The virus enters susceptible cells through the P blood antigen receptors on the erythrocyte precursors. Inside the red cells, the virus enters the nucleus, starts replicating, followed by killing of the red cells. The production of RBCs is stopped for approximately 1 week due to killing of the erythroid precursor cells by the viruses. The initial stage is associated with flu-like illness caused by large viremia. The viruses are shed in the oral and respiratory secretions and even cross the placenta. Subsequently, viremia is controlled by the production of specific antibodies against B19 virus. The rash and arthralgia present the second stage of the disease and is believed to be immunologically mediated. This stage coincides with the disappearance of B19 virus from the circulation, appearance of B19 virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, and finally the formation of immune complexes. Host immunity The disease exhibits two stages: initial stage is flu-like illness and second stage is appearance of rash and arthralgia. Host immunity to B19 virus infection is primarily antibody medi-ated. The circulating antibodies stop the viremia and are impor-tant for resolution of the disease. The role of cell-mediated immunity in conferring immunity to B19 virus is unknown. Clinical Syndromes B19 virus causes following clinical syndromes: (a) flu-like illness, (b) erythema infectiosum or fifth disease, (c) infection in pregnant women, and (d) chronic B19 infection. Flu-like illness B19 virus most commonly causes a flu-like illness. Malaise, headache, myalgia, and rhinorrhea are the common symptoms. Erythema infectiosum or fifth disease B19 virus is an additional causative agent of erythema infec-tiosum or fifth disease, the condition seen most commonly in children. The infection begins with nonspecific symptoms, followed by appearance of a distinctive rash on fifth day of infection. A bright red rash develops on both cheeks that appear as they have been slapped. The rash then appears on the trunk, which spreads gradually toward the arms and legs. The condition usually subsides within 1-2 weeks.Aplastic anemia: Transient but severe aplastic anemia can occur in children with chronic anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and spherocytosis (aplastic crisis) after infection with B19 virus. Gloves and sock syndrome is another serious complication caused by B19 virus. In this syndrome, erythematous exanthema appears on the hands and feet, with a well-defined margin on the wrist and ankle joints. Infection in pregnant women If the B19 virus causes reinfection in a pregnant mother who is infected earlier by the same virus and is already immune to the virus (showing positive B19 antibodies), then no adverse effects are seen in the fetus. In nonimmune seronegative preg-nant mothers, B19 virus infection is increasingly associated with risk for fetal death. The infection may cause severe anemia in the fetus and subsequently, the fetus may develop signs of high-output cardiac failure (hydrops fetalis). B19 virus, however, does not cause any congenital anomalies in the fetus. Chronic B19 infection This infection occurs in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with HIV, those receiving immunosuppressive ther-apy, and transplant patients. Chronic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are the common manifestations. Epidemiology Geographical distribution B19 virus is distributed worldwide. The exact data on seroposi-tivity in population world over is not known. Approximately, 90% of adults older than 60 years are seropositive in the United States. Similar data from other parts of the world are lacking. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection B19 virus infection is strictly a human disease. Humans are the only reservoir. Viruses are excreted in respiratory samples, which are the primary source of infection. The infected patient is conta-gious from 24 to 48 hours before developing prodromal syndrome till the appearance of rash. The infection is transmitted by: vertical transmission during birth; respiratory route through respiratory secretions; and percutaneous exposure to blood and transfusion of blood and blood products (pooled RBCs, platelets, intravenous immunoglobulins, etc.). Laboratory Diagnosis Demonstration of specific IgG and IgM antibodies in the serum is useful for of erythema assay), RIA and IFA (indirect fluorescent anti-body) for demonstration of IgG and IgM antibodies are avail-able. In pregnant women, the serum positive for IgG and IgM antibodies indicates B19 virus infection within 7 days to 4 months and a possible risk to fetus. Positive IgG but negative IgM result indicates only past infection, hence no risk to fetus. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is available to demonstrate B19 virus genome in the blood. The positive result suggests viremia or infection.Treatment No specific antiviral therapy is available for treatment of B19 virus infection. Prevention and Control No specific measures are available for prevention of the infec-tion. Development of a vaccine against B19 virus is undergoing phase I clinical trial. A 31-year-old man with HIV was admitted to a hospital with aplastic anemia. The serum was positive for B19 viral genome by PCR. What is the most likely route of transmission? What are the clinical manifestations of B19 virus infection in children and in pregnant women? Describe the laboratory methods for diagnosis of B19 virus infection.CASE STUDY Chap-59.indd 495 5/14/2012 5:51:46 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 60 Introduction The family Picornaviridae is one of the largest families of viruses and includes a large number of very small ( pico: measuring small; rna: RNA virus) RNA viruses. They are nonenveloped viruses measuring 27-30 nm in size. The capsid is a naked icosahedral made up of 60 protein subunits. The genome consists of a single linear molecule of single-stranded RNA. The genome RNA is unusual, because it has a protein at the 5 /H11032 end that serves as a primer for transcription by RNA polymerase. Classification The family Picornaviridae consists of more than 230 members and is divided into five genera: Enterovirus , and Hepatovirus ) are the important viruses, which cause disease in humans. Two other genera (Arthrovirus and Cardiovirus) are of veterinary importance and cause foot-and-mouth disease in cattle and meningoencepha-lomyelitis in mice. The picornaviruses causing human infec-tions are summarized in Table 60-1. The important features of picornaviruses are summarized in Table 60-2. Enteroviruses Human enteroviruses consist of at least 72 serotypes, include poliovirus types 1-3, coxsackieviruses and entero-viruses 68-71. Originally hepatitis A virus (enterovirus 72) was included in this group but has been reclassified as a hepatovi-rus in the genus Hepatovirus (Chapter 66). The capsids of the enteroviruses are very resistant to environmental conditions and the conditions in the gastro-intestinal tracts. They can remain viable for several weeks in feces at room temperature. They also remain viable for a year at /H1100220 to /H11002 70\u00b0C and for months at 4\u00b0C. The virus may sur- vive heat at 60\u00b0C in food stuffs and also holder method of pasteurization. The enteroviruses are also rapidly inactivated by 0.3% formaldehyde, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, drying, or ultraviolet light. The enteroviruses are readily killed by moist heat at 50-55\u00b0C, and they are also inactivated on exposure to ether, chloroform, and deoxycholate. A higher concentration of chlorine is necessary in water to inactivate the virus in the presence of organic matter, because the latter diminishes the activities of residual chlorine. Most enteroviruses are host specific; they infect only one or a few related species. Poliovirus Poliomyelitis is an enteric infection caused by polioviruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route. The worldwide preva-lence of poliomyelitis has decreased by more than 99% due to improved socioeconomic conditions and availability of vaccines. Properties of the Virus Morphology Polioviruses show the following features: Poliovirus was the first animal virus to be purified and obtained in crystalline form. The viruses are spherical particles about 27 nm in diameter (Fig. 60-1). The virion is composed of 60 subunits, each consisting of four viral proteins (VP1-VP4). The viral protein VP1 contains the major antigenic site for combination with type-specific neutralizing antibodies. The viral genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA, which can be directly translated by host ribosomes to form a polyprotein, which is divided into 11 different proteins. Viral replication Polioviruses are cytolytic; they replicate in cytoplasm of the host cell. Polioviruses show high host specificity restricted to primates, which include both humans and nonhuman pri-mates, such as monkeys and apes. This is due to presence of a specific receptor that is present only on primate cell mem-brane. However, purified viral RNA without the capsid protein can enter and replicate in many nonprimate cells by avoiding the cell membrane receptors. The virion causes infection first by binding to the spe- cific receptor on the cell membrane and enters the cell. Once inside the cell, the virion uncoats by removing the capsid and releases the RNA genome. The RNA serves as the mRNA and is translated into a very large polypeptide known as noncapsid 2, 5-7, Encephalitis 2-6, 8, 10 Herpangina 5, 10, 16 Hand-foot-and-mouth disease 4, 9 Hepatitis 9, 16 Pneumonitis of infants 18, 20-22, 24 Diarrhea 21, 24 Cold 24 Acute hemorrhagic infants, pericarditis 5 Exanthemas and hepatitis 1, 3-5 Cold 4, 5 Pneumonia 3, 4 Diabetes mellitus Echovirus 1-34 Aseptic meningitis and diarrhea 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 30 Paralysis 2, 6, 9, 19 Encephalitis 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 16, 18 Exanthemas1, 6, 9 Pleurodynia 1, 6, 9, 19 Myocarditis and pericarditis 4, 9, 11, 20, 25 Cold 4, 9 Hepatitis 11 Generalized disease of infants Enterovirus 68 Pneumonia 70 Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis 71 Pulmonary edema, herpangina, aseptic Rhinoviruses /H11022 100 Common coldTABLE 60-1 Human infections caused picornaviruses Virus Antigenic types Serotypes Stability at acid pHOptimal temperature for growth (\u00b0C)Sites of isolation Nose Throat Intestine Poliovirus 1-3 3 Stable 37 /H11002/H11001 /H11001 Coxsackie 23 Stable 37 Chap-60.indd 497 5/14/2012 12:22:43 PMSection IV Chapter 60498 VIROLOGY viral protein. Subsequently, the viral protein is utilized by the viral enzyme protease to form capsid proteins of the progeny virions as well as several noncapsid proteins including the RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase initiates the synthesis of progeny RNA genomes. This is followed by assembly of the progeny virions by coating of the genome RNA with capsid proteins in the cell cytoplasm. The release of progeny virions occurs by the lysis and death of the cells, but not by budding from the cell membrane. Antigenic properties The polioviruses have been classified into three serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) on the basis of neutralization test. The p rototype strains for type 1 poliovirus are Brunhilde and Mahoney strains, for type 2 poliovirus are Lansing and MEFI strains, and for type 3 poliovirus are Leon and Saukett strains. Type 1 is the most common poliovirus and causes most epi-demics of poliomyelitis; type 2 strain is usually associated with endemic infections, whereas type 3 strains occasionally cause epidemics. Two antigens, C (coreless or capsid) and D (dense) are recognized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or precipitation test. The C antigen, also known as heated or H antigen is associated with the empty, noninfec-tious virus. It is less specific and reacts with heterotypic sera. The D antigen, also known as the nature or N antigen is asso-ciated with the whole virion. It is more specific and is type specific. Antibodies against D antigen are protective; hence the potency of injectable polio vaccine is measured in terms of D antigen unit. Other properties Poliovirus is sensitive to heat and is readily inactivated at 55\u00b0C for 30 minutes. It is also sensitive to formaldehyde and oxidiz-ing disinfectants. The viruses are readily destroyed by chlo-rination in water, but the presence of organic matter delays inactivation. Polioviruses are resistant to lipid-soluble agents (ether, chlo- roform, and bile), proteolytic enzymes of the intestine, and detergents. They survive in feces for months at 4\u00b0C and for years at /H1100220\u00b0C. They survive for days to several weeks in feces at room temperature depending on the environmental condi-tions, such as temperature, moisture, acidity, etc. Polioviruses are killed by lyophilization. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Cell culture Polioviruses grow readily in cell lines of primate origin. They can be cultured on monkey kidney cell lines, human amnion, HeLa, Hep-2, MRC-5, and other cell lines. The consist of cell retraction, increased refractivity, cytoplas-mic granularity, and nuclear pyknosis and are observed within 48 hours of inoculation. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies may be demonstrated in stained preparation of the infected cell lines. Well-formed plaques develop in infected monolayers with agar overlay. Laboratory animals Cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys are commonly used animals. They can be experimentally infected by intracerebral or intra-spinal inoculation. Cynomolgus monkeys and chimpanzees can also be infected orally. Laboratory-maintained strains may grow in rodents and chick embryos. But fresh isolates of poliovirus cannot grow in these hosts. Pathogenesis and Immunity Poliovirus is transmitted by the fecal oral route on ingestion of contaminated water. The viral particles initially multiply in the nasopharynx and the gastrointestinal mucosa. The virions are resistant to acidity of stomach and to lytic activi-ties of the protease and other enzymes of the intestinal tract and bile. Pathogenesis of poliomyelitis On entering the body, the virus infects and multiplies in the tonsils and Peyer's patch of the ileum. It then spreads to regional lymph nodes and enters the blood, causing a primary viremia. On continued infection and multiplication of virus in the reticuloendothelial cells, it invades the blood stream again and causes secondary viremia. During this period of viremia, the poliovirus crosses the blood-brain barrier or gains access to the brain by infecting skeletal muscle and traveling up on the nerves to the brain as in rabies virus. Poliovirus shows tissue tropism by specifically combining with neural cells. It recognizes a receptor present on the anterior horn cells of ( a) the spinal cord, (b ) dorsal root ganglia, and (c ) motor neurons. On combination at these sites, the poliovirus causes destruction of the motor neurons, anterior horn, and brain stem. The destruction of motor neurons leads to paralysis of the muscles innervated by those neurons. Paralysis is not caused by the virus infect-ing the muscles. The poliovirus also infects the brain stem, VP1 to VP4) PMSection IV Chapter poliomyelitis associated with respiratory paralysis. Poliovirus causing the pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS) is usually responsible for causing symp-toms of poliomyelitis. Immune mechanisms do not play any role in pathogenesis of the disease. Host immunity Host immunity in poliomyelitis is mostly dependent on the humoral antibodies. Both the serum and secretory antibod-ies play an important role in conferring protection against poliomyelitis. Serum IgM antibodies appear within a week of infection and persist for nearly 6 months. IgG antibodies, which develop subsequently, persist lifelong. The neutralizing antibodies in the blood protect against disease by the same serotype of poliovirus. These antibodies, however, do not prevent infection of the intestinal neuron and excretion of virus in the feces. Secretary IgA antibodies provide mucosal immunity against the virus (a) by preventing intestinal infections and ( b) by preventing shedding of virus. The IgA antibody in the breast milk protects the infants from infection. Therefore, the poliomyelitis tends to be more severe and shedding of virus is more prolonged in the infected human host with altered humoral immune response. Cell-mediated immunity plays little or very insignificant role in the immunity against poliovirus. Host immunity is type specific. However, there is a significant amount of cross- protection between type 1 and 2 and type 2 and 3 poliovi-ruses. There is little or no cross-protection between type 1 and 3 strains. Clinical Syndromes Poliovirus causes a wide spectrum of illness in unvaccinated people, such as (a) asymptomatic illness, (b) abortive polio-myelitis, (c) nonparalytic poliomyelitis, (d) paralytic polio, and (e) postpoliomyelitis syndrome. Incubation period is usually 10 days but may vary from 4 days to 4 weeks. Asymptomatic illness Most patients (90-95%) infected with poliovirus develop inap-parent infection and are asymptomatic. This asymptomatic illness is caused as a result of viral infection confined to the oropharynx and the intestine. Abortive poliomyelitis Abortive poliomyelitis is the minor illness occurring in approximately 5% of infected people. This is a febrile illness characterized by fever, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Neurological symptoms are typically absent. The duration of this illness is usually less than 5 days. Nonparalytic poliomyelitis Nonparalytic poliomyelitis also known as aseptic meningitis is caused by invasion of virus into the CNS. The symptoms of nonparalytic poliomyelitis are similar to those of abortive poliomyelitis but are more intense. Stiffness of the posterior muscles of the neck, trunk, and limbs is present in addition to the symptoms of the minor illness. This condition occurs in 1-2% of infected patients. Paralytic polio This is the major illness, which occurs in 0.1-2% of individuals infected with poliovirus. This is the most severe manifestation of poliomyelitis and appears 3-4 days after the abortive polio-myelitis has subsided. This condition is caused due to invasion of virus from blood to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and the motor cortex of the brain. Depending on the various tissues or organs affected and the intensity of neuronal infec-tion, poliomyelitis may be of two types, as follows:Paralytic poliomyelitis: Paralytic poliomyelitis or spinal paralysis is characterized by spinal paralysis involving one or more limbs. Asymmetrical flaccid paralysis with no sensory loss is the typical manifestation. This condition is caused mostly by poliovirus type 1. This condition is seen in some of the vaccinated individuals following vaccination. This occurs due to reversion of the attenuated vaccine virus types 2 and 3 to virulence types. In this condition, there may be paralysis of only one limb, such as one leg or there may be complete flaccid paralysis of both the legs and hands. The condition may prog-ress to death or may recover completely with residual paralysis.Bulbar poliomyelitis: This is caused due to involvement of the cranial nerves, most commonly 9th, 10th, and 12th. This condition tends to be more severe with involvement of the mus-cles of the pharynx, vocal cords, and respiration. The condition may cause death in 75% of the patients. Postpoliomyelitis syndrome This condition is sequelae of poliomyelitis, which may develop 20-40 years after infection with poliovirus. This condition is seen in 20-80% of patients who have recovered from poliomy-elitis. Recurrence of weakness or fatigue is observed in this con-dition, and it usually involves the muscles that were initially affected by the poliovirus. Epidemiology Poliovirus mainly affects children. However, individuals of any age may also develop the disease. Key Points Most epidemics of paralytic poliomyelitis are caused by poliovirus type 1, less commonly by type 3. Poliovirus type 2 is a common cause of paralytic polio-myelitis in India and is the causative agent of illness in Western countries. Chap-60.indd 499 5/14/2012 12:22:44 PMSection IV Chapter 60500 VIROLOGY Geographical distribution Polio continues to remain a major public health problem in developing countries. Six countries have been identified as endemic for poliomyelitis in the year 2003. These include Afghanistan, Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, and India. Significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of poliomyelitis in India. Efforts have been recently maximized to eliminate poliovirus infection in the very near future. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Natural infection occurs only in humans. Infected humans excreting poliovirus in their stool are the major reservoir of infection. Infected stool containing poliovirus is the major source. The viruses secreted in throat secretions during early stage of the illness may also be another source of infection. The poliovirus is transmitted: primarily by the fecal-oral route by ingestion of food and water contaminated with human feces. by inhalation or through fomites contaminated with respi-ratory secretions. Poor sanitation, low socioeconomic status, and crowded living conditions facilitate transmission of infection. Immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV infec-tion, B cell dysfunction, and IgA deficiency are particularly at high risk of developing poliomyelitis when exposed to poliovirus. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Stool, throat swab, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the speci-mens used for isolation of the viruses. Viruses can be isolated from feces for more than 30 days during the illness and from the throat swab during the first few days of the illness. The virus is isolated rarely from the CSF specimens. Microscopy Microscopy of the CSF shows a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis with the presence of 25-500 cells/mm 3. The virus is rarely demonstrated in the CSF. Isolation of the virus Isolation of viruses from clinical specimen by tissue culture is the most specific method in the diagnosis of poliomyelitis.Cell culture: Virus isolation from feces and throat swab is car-ried out by cultivation on monkey kidney, human amnion, HeLa, Hep-2, Buffalo green monkey (BGM), MRC-5, and other cell cul-tures. The cytopathic effects produced by the virus are observed within 48 hours. These consist of cell retraction, increased refractivity, cytoplasmic granularity, and nuclear pyknosis. Identification of serotype is carried out by performing neutral-ization test. Differentiation of a wild virulent virus strain from that of an attenuated vaccine strain can be done by virulence test in the monkeys and by performing polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR). Isolation of poliovirus from feces does not indicate a diagnosis of poliomyelitis, as large numbers of asymptomatic ill-nesses are seen. Hence, isolation of poliomyelitis virus from feces needs to be interpreted carefully along with clinical presentation of the disease. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis is based on demonstration of a fourfold increase in the antibody titer of the serum collected at the time of acute illness and the period of convalescence. Neutralization or complement fixation test is carried out to demonstrate anti-bodies. Neutralizing antibodies appear early and are present throughout life. However, serodiagnosis is less frequently used for diagnosis of poliomyelitis. Molecular Diagnosis PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of poliomyelitis. The test, however, is not widely available in the developing countries. Treatment No antivirals are available for the treatment of poliomyelitis. Prevention and Control Poliovirus vaccines are the key component in prevention of polio and have played an important role in the effort to eradi-cate polio worldwide. Vaccines Two types of vaccines used are as follows:Inactivated polio vaccine: Inactivated polio vaccine or Salk vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1956 for immuniza-tion against poliomyelitis. The vaccine contains formalin- inactivated strains of the three serotypes of the poliovirus grown in monkey kidney cell culture. The vaccine is given to children by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections in three doses. The vaccine is given at 2 months, 4 months, and at school entry, which is usually at 4 years. It does not cause development of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis (VAP). The injection of the vaccine elicits the production of higher IgG antibody titers in the serum, but it does not stimulate the production of detectable level of secretory IgA in the gut, hence does not prevent alimentary tract infection. The main advantage of this vaccine is that since it uses killed viruses, it can be safely used for immunization in immunocompromised hosts. The disadvantages of this vaccine are that (a) it is not as immunogenic as oral polio vaccine, (b) it does not induce local mucosal immunity in the gut, and (c) it needs to be adminis-tered parenterally, which shows poor compliance.Live attenuated oral polio vaccine: Live attenuated oral polio vaccine or Sabin vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin in the year 1962. It contains live attenuated strains of the three serotypes of poliovirus cultured in monkey kidney cells or human diploid cells. The vaccine is given orally, which causes Chap-60.indd 500 5/14/2012 12:22:44 PMSection IV Chapter 60PICORNAVIRUSES 501 Key Points Coxsackie A virus produces generalized myositis, flaccid paralysis followed by death within a week in suckling mice. Coxsackie B virus produces patchy focal myositis, spastic paralysis, localized lesions in the liver, myocardium, pan-creas, and brain, and brown fat pads. The structure and morphology of the coxsackieviruses and the RNA genome are similar to those of poliovirus. But unlike poliovirus, they can infect mammals other than primates. Replication cycle is similar to that of poliovirus. Coxsackie A viruses consist of 24 serotypes and are associated with diseases involving vesicular lesions, such as herpangina. Coxsackie B viruses consist of six serotypes and are most frequently associated with myocarditis and pleurodynia. Coxsackie A viruses show tropism for skin and mucous membranes, whereas coxsackie B viruses show predilection for visceral organs, such as liver, heart, pancreas, and pleura. Both the viruses infect anterior horn cells of the motor neurons and meninges and cause paralysis. They replicate first in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract from where they spread by the blood circulation. Host immunity is IgG-antibody mediated and is type specific. Coxsackievirus infection occurs worldwide. Humans are the only natural hosts. The viruses are transmitted primarily by fecal-oral route. Diseases Caused by Coxsackie A Diseases specifically caused by coxsackie A viruses include the following:Herpangina: This condition is caused by coxsackie A virus serotypes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. The infection is most commonly Vaccine Advantages Disadvantages Live (oral) vaccine Effective Risk of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis in vaccine recipients Lifelong immunity Not safe for administration to immunodeficient patients Induction of local immunity Unstable\u2014to be stored in cold conditions Induction of herd immunityEase of administrationNo need for repeated booster vaccineCheapUseful in epidemics Killed (parenteral) vaccine Effective Lack of induction of secretory antibody Stable Booster dose needed for lifelong immunity Safe in immunodeficient patients Costly No risk of vaccine-related disease No community protectionNot useful in epidemicsTABLE 60-3 Advantages and disadvantages of polio vaccinesCoxsackieviruses Coxsackieviruses are so named, because the viruses were first isolated in Coxsackie village in New York, United States, by Dandruff and Sickel in the year 1985. These viruses based on the pathological changes produced in suckling mice are classified into two groups: coxsackieviruses A and coxsackieviruses B.Vaccines natural infection. It elicits production of both local secretory IgA antibodies in the pharynx and alimentary tract, and humoral IgG antibodies in the serum. The virus lacks the capability to multiply in the CNS, hence is non-neurovirulent. The vaccine virus is excreted for several weeks in the feces during which the vaccine virus spread may occur to close contacts, inducing or boosting immunity in them. The first dose of vaccine is given to infants at age of 1\u00bd months along with DPT. Second, third, and fourth doses of vaccine are given when children are raised to 2\u00bd, 3\u00bd, and 16-24 months, respectively. Oral polio vaccine has been used since the 1960s. This vaccine has been mainly responsible for significant decrease in prevalence of disease throughout the world. The advantages of this vaccine are many: first, it induces local mucosal immunity; second, it provides appropriate herd immunity, and finally, it is cost-effective, especially in developing countries. The major disadvantage of this vaccine is the loss of efficacy of the vaccine due to improper cold chain. Association of the vaccine with VAP is another major disadvantage. Although the virus content in this vaccine is attenuated, it may become neurotropic and may produce dis-ease similar to wild type virus. The risk of VAP has been estimated at between 0.5 and 3.4 cases per million. Advantages and disadvantages of Sabin and Salk vaccines are summarized in Table 60-3. Recently, a new monovalent oral poliovi-rus type I vaccine (MOPVI) has been introduced. This is used to elim-inate some of the last poliovirus reservoirs in the endemic countries. The vaccine is contraindicated in children who are immunocompro-mised and also in those whose caretakers are immunocompromised. Chap-60.indd 501 5/14/2012 12:22:44 PMSection IV Chapter 60502 VIROLOGY seen in children between 1 and 7 years. The symptoms include sudden onset of fever, sore throat, and difficulty in swallow-ing. The classical finding is a painful vesicular eruption of the oral mucosa around the soft palate and uvula. Less commonly, these lesions may be found on the hard palate. The condition is self-limiting. The viruses are isolated from the lesions or from the feces.Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: This is a vesicular exan- thema usually caused by coxsackievirus serotypes 5 and 16. This is mainly a disease of children, seen most commonly in patients younger than 10 years. After an incubation period of 3-6 days, the infection begins with prodromal symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, and anorexia. After 12-36 hours, vesicular eruptions appear on the hands, feet, and oral cavity. This is a self-limiting condition and the illness subsides in a few days. Diseases Caused by Coxsackie B Diseases specifically caused by coxsackie B viruses include the following:Pleurodynia: This condition, also known as epidemic myalgia or Bornholm disease, is caused by coxsackie B virus serotypes 3 and 5. This condition is an acute illness, which manifests with a sudden onset of fever accompanied by muscular pain and pain in the chest and abdomen. The pain is spasmodic in nature. The condition usually lasts for 4 days but may relapse again after the condition has been asymptomatic for several days.Myocarditis: This is a serious condition caused by coxsackie B virus, mostly in newborn infants. Shortness of breath, dull or sharp chest pain, and fever are the common manifestations of the condition. This is a life-threatening condition mostly in newborns. In adults, the condition presents with myocardial infection with fever. The condition is associated with a high morbidity. Diseases Caused by Coxsackie A and B Diseases caused by both coxsackie A and B viruses include aseptic meningitis.Aseptic meningitis: The condition is caused by coxsackie A serotypes 2, 4, 7, and 9 and by coxsackie B viruses. The labora- tory diagnosis of coxsackievirus infection is made by isolation of the virus from the feces or from lesions by intracerebral or intra-peritoneal inoculation into a 1-da y-old mouse. Identification of the virus is carried out by histopathology study of the infected mouse after sacrifice. Some of the coxsackieviruses can also be isolated by culture in human diploid embryonic lung fibro-blasts, BGM, and HeLa cell lines. Cytopathic effects resemble those of polioviruses but develop more slowly, beginning as foci of rounded refractile cells, which die and fall off the glass. Differences between coxsackieviruses A and B are summarized in Table 60-4. Echoviruses Echoviruses were originally isolated from the feces of an indi-vidual who had no clinical illness and caused a cytopathic effect in the cell culture. The prefix ECHO is an acronym for enteric cytopathogenic human orphan viruses (ECHO viruses). They were earlier called \"orphans\", because these viruses were not associated earlier with any disease but now they are known to cause a variety of human illnesses. The echoviruses resemble other enteroviruses in their properties. They are classified into 32 serotypes (1-34 except 10 and 28) on the basis of their type-specific neutralization cap-sid antigen. Some serotypes of echoviruses (types 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 24, 29, 30, and 33) cause hemagglutination of human red cells. Agglutination of red cells is followed by elu-tion, making the red cells inagglutinable by echoviruses or cox-sackieviruses but not by myxoviruses. All echoviruses grow in human and monkey kidney cell lines, producing cytopathic effects. Humans are the natural hosts for these viruses. Echoviruses are found in the intestinal tract of the infected humans. The infection like other enterovirus is transmitted by fecal-oral route. Most of the echoviruses cause asymptomatic infections in humans, but some of them have been associated with many clinical syndromes. Nonspecific febrile illness associated with rash, headache, and common-cold-like symptoms is caused by many serotypes of echoviruses. Aseptic meningitis is also caused by echoviruses. Some strains of echovirus have been associated with gastroenteritis (serotype 8) and respi-ratory diseases in children (serotypes 1, 11, 19, 20, and 22). Laboratory diagnosis of echovirus infection is made by isolation of viruses from feces, throat swab, or CSF. They are cultured using human diploid embryonic lung fibroblast and human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. The growth of the virus is detected by cytopathic changes, which is similar to that of other coxsackieviruses.

Of these, enterovirus 69 does not cause any human diseases, but rest of the three enterovi-ruses cause diseases in humans. Type 68 causes pneumonia and bronchitis, type 70 causes acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), and type 71 causes meningoencephalitis and paralysis. Enterovirus 70 Enterovirus 70 is the causative agent of acute hemorrhagic con-junctivitis (AHC). The condition was first recognized in 1969 in Ghana and Indonesia. Subsequently, the condition spread widely, involving several parts of Japan, England, Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Southeast Asia including India. Coxsackievirus A 24 has also been known to cause the similar disease. AHC is a highly contagious ocular infection, which can cause large-scale epidemics. Transmission is facilitated by over-crowding and nonsanitary conditions. The infection is trans-mitted directly from finger or fomite to eye. The condition is most prevalent in adults between 20 and 50 years. The incubation period is about 24 hours, and the onset is abrupt. The most common symptoms include pain in the eyes, burning sensation, swelling of the eyelids, and foreign body sensation in the eye. Photophobia and watery discharge may also be found in some cases. The other eye becomes infected a few hours after infection of the first eye. Fever, mal-aise, and headache are the nonspecific symptoms. AHC is a self- limiting condition. The symptoms typically improve by second or third day of infection, and the recovery is complete within 7-10 days. Isolation of the virus is made by culturing in human diploid embryonic kidney and HeLa cell lines. Rhinoviruses Rhinoviruses are the most important causative agents of com-mon cold and upper respiratory tract infections. Earlier, many viruses isolated from the cases of common cold were known as common cold viruses, Salisbury viruses, or Muri viruses. Now all these viruses have been given the name rhinoviruses (rhino referring to the organ specifically affected). Rhinoviruses are small RNA viruses, morphologically resem- bling other picornaviruses. They grow better in vivo at a tem-perature of 30\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C, a property that contributes partially for predilection of these viruses for the cooler envi-ronment of the nose and conjunctiva. The rhinoviruses have been classified into more than 102 serotypes on the basis of a type-specific antigen in their capsids. Rhinoviruses differ from other picornavirus in being more acid labile and more heat stable. They are inactivated at a low pH below 5 and become completely inactive at pH 3. They are relatively stable at 20-37\u00b0C and can survive on environmental surfaces, such as door knobs, for several days. Some serotypes may survive heating at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour. They are resistant to 20% ether and 5% chloroform but are sensitive to hypochlorite and aldehyde. Differences between enteroviruses and rhinovi-ruses are summarized in Table 60-5. Rhinoviruses grow at 37\u00b0C in cell lines of human or simian origin in the presence of good oxygenation, low pH (7 or less), and low temperature. They can grow in human embryonic tracheal epithelial, human diploid cell lines, and HeLa cells, but without producing conspicuous cytopathic effects. Some strains grow well in both monkey and human cell lines and are designated as M strains, and those that grow only on human cells are known as H strains. Infection is transmitted to other susceptible human hosts by nasal secretions expelled from the nose of a patient during sneezing and coughing. Infection can be initiated by as little as one infectious viral particle. During the acute phase of illness, nasal secretions contain approximately 500-1000 infectious virions/mL of secretions. Also, these secretions may contami-nate hands, fingers, handkerchiefs, or paper tissues, and the normal susceptible hosts who come in contact with these con-taminated surfaces acquire the virus. The virus enters through the nose, mouth, or eyes and causes infections of the upper respiratory tract including the throat. The infection occurs mostly by multiplication of the virus in the nose. The onset and severity of the symptoms usually correlate with the quantity of viruses excreted in the nasal secretion and the time of viral shedding. Infected cells release bradykinin and histamine, which cause a running nose. The progression of infection is limited by an interferon which is produced in nasal secretion in response to the nasal infections. However, the cytokines produced during infection can pro-mote the spread of the virus by enhancing the expression of inter-CAM-1 viral receptor. Host immunity in rhinoviruses is characterized by both humoral and cell-mediated immunities. Humoral immunity is characterized by the production of both nasal secretory IgA and serum IgG antibodies within a week of infection. The cell- mediated immunity does not play any important role in controlling rhinovirus infection. Immunity is transient and Property nm single Polypeptides VP1-VP4 VP1-VP4 Optimum temperature for growth37 \u00b0C3 3\u00b0C Effect of acid Stable (pH 3.9) Density in usually serotype specific. Therefore, one attack of com-mon cold by rhinovirus does not confer immunity against subsequent attacks due to presence of numerous serotypes of the virus. Rhinoviruses are the major cause of common cold and are responsible for more than 50% of all colds worldwide. Other viruses which may also cause common cold include coronaviruses, coxsackieviruses A21 and A24, echoviruses 11 and 20, and parainfluenza viruses. Rhinovirus causes common cold after an incubation period of 2-4 days. The condition begins as an upper respiratory infec-tion with sneezing, soon followed by a running nose ( rhinorrhea). Rhinorrhea then increases and is associated with symptoms of nasal obstruction. Mild sore throat, headache, malaise, fever, and rigor sometimes accompany rhinovirus infection. Usually, symptoms subside in about a week, but in some cases the cough and nasal symptoms may persist for 7-10 days or longer. The clinical manifestations of the common cold are characteristic; hence laboratory diagnosis may not be necessary. Infected humans suffering from acute illness are the only reservoirs and sources of rhinovirus that cause common cold. Asymptomatic people also play an important role in transmit-ting the infection even though they shed few viruses in their respiratory secretions. Rhinovirus is transmitted mainly by two routes: first, by direct inhalation of infectious droplets and second, by direct contact with hands or fomites contaminated with respiratory droplets. Contaminated hands appear to be the major route of transmission, and direct person-to-person contact is the major mode of spread of infection. Common cold occurs most commonly in infants and in children and occurs most frequently in the early autumn and the late spring in people living in tem-perate climates. The nonenveloped rhinoviruses are extremely stable and survive on external objects, such as fomites for many hours, thereby facilitating transmission of infection. Laboratory diagnosis is made by isolation of the virus from nasal washing by culture on human diploid fibroblast cells (e.g., WI-38 at 33\u00b0C). The rhinoviruses are identified by their typical cytopathic effects and demonstration of acid lability. Serotyping of the strains is performed with the use of pools of specific neutralizing antisera. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic. No vaccine is available against rhinovirus. Hand washing and disinfection of contaminated objects are the best methods of preventing transmission of the virus. Hepatitis A Virus Hepatitis A virus, formerly known as enterovirus, has now been accorded the status of a separate genus Hepatovirus of the family Picornaviridae. The virus is discussed in detail in Chapter 66. A 7-year-old girl came to a hospital with flaccid paralysis of right leg. Her parents provided the history of paralysis for the past 2 weeks. On examination, no sensory loss was elicited in the affected right leg. The girl was suspected to be suffer-ing from paralytic poliomyelitis. On enquiry, the parents gave the history of the girl receiving oral polio vaccine during her childhood. What is the cause of vaccination failure in this girl? What are the countries in the world in which polio still continues to be endemic? What are the mechanisms of pathogenesis of poliomyelitis? How would the diagnosis be confirmed in the laboratory?CASE STUDY Chap-60.indd 504 5/14/2012 12:22:44 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 61 Introduction The term myxovirus was coined for a group of enveloped RNA viruses that have the ability to adsorb onto mucopro-tein receptors on erythrocytes, causing hemagglutination. It included influenza, mumps, parainfluenza, and Newcastle disease viruses. Classification All these viruses were grouped under myxovirus (myxa meaning mucus) due to their affinity to mucins. The influenza, mumps, parainfluenza, and Newcastle disease viruses were initially grouped in this class. However, two separate families were created subsequent to the recognition of clear differences between these viruses. These two fami-lies are: Orthomyxoviridae, consisting of influenza viruses, and Paramyxoviridae, consisting of parainfluenza, mumps, measles, respiratory syncytial, and Newcastle disease viruses. Differences between orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are summarized in Table 61-1. The genus Orthomyxovirus includes influenza viruses, the causative agents of worldwide epidemics of influenza. Human diseases associated with influenza virus are presented in Table 61-2.

They cause influenza, an acute respiratory disease, with well-defined systemic symptoms. Influenza is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory tract that occurs in sporadic, epidemic, and pandemic forms. Properties of the Virus Morphology Influenza viruses show following features: Influenza viruses are spherical or filamentous, enveloped particles 80-120 nm in diameter. Influenza virus is composed of a characteristic segmented single-stranded RNA genome, a nucleocapsid, and an envelope (Fig. 61-1). The viral genome is a single-stranded antisense RNA. The genome consists of an RNA-dependent RNA which transcribes the negative-polarity genome into mRNA. The genome, therefore, is not infectious. The viral RNA has a molecular weight of 5 million daltons and a length of 13,600 nucleotides. Characteristically, it is segmented and consists of seven or eight segments. These segments code for different proteins which are NS1, NS2, NP, M1, M2, M3, HA, and NA. The genome is present in a helically symmetric nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope. The envelope has an inner membrane protein layer and an outer lipid layer. The mem-brane proteins are known as matrix or M protein and are composed of two components M1 and M2. Chap-61.indd 505 5/14/2012 1:05:40 PMSection IV Chapter 61506 VIROLOGY Two types of spikes or peplomers project from the envelope: (a) the triangular hemagglutinin (HA) peplomers and (b) the mushroom-shaped neuraminidase (NA) peplomers. Viral replication Influenza virus, hepatitis delta virus, and retroviruses are the only RNA viruses that have an important stage of their replica-tion cycle in the nucleus. Infection of the host cell begins by adsorption of the cell by influenza virus, which is mediated through the HA. HA is first cleaved by an extracellular protease to a modified HA that actually mediates the attachment of the virus to the cell surface. Once inside the cell, the virus uncoats within the endosome.In the nucleus of the host cell, the virion RNA polymerase transcribes the eight-genome segments into eight viral mRNAs. Most of the viral mRNAs, however, move out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into viral proteins. Some of the viral mRNAs continue to remain in the nucleus and serve as the templates for synthesis of the negative-strand RNA genomes for the progeny virions. In the nucleus also, two proteins, namely, nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein are synthesized, which then bind with the RNA genome of the viral progeny and form a complex, which is subsequently trans-ported to the cytoplasm. Matrix protein mediates the interaction of the nucleocapsid with the envelope, and finally, the virion is released from the cell by budding from the cell membrane at the site where the HA and NAs are present. Antigenic and genomic properties Influenza viruses have two types of antigens:Group-specific antigens: The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antigen, or the \"soluble\" antigen, or the internal antigen is the group-specific antigen. Influenza viruses are divided into types A, B, and C on the basis of variation in this nucleoprotein antigen.Type-specific antigens: The surface antigen, or \"viral\" anti-gen, or \"V antigen\" is composed of two virus-encoded proteins, HA and NA, which are the type-specific antigens (Fig. 61-2).Hemagglutinin: HA is a trimer and is composed of two poly-peptides, HA1 and HA2, responsible for hemadsorption and of structure of an influenza virus.

The triangular-shaped HA is inserted into the virus membrane by its tail end. The distal end, which contains five antigenic sites (designated as HA1-HA5), is responsible for binding of virion to host cells. Influenza viruses adsorb many avian and mammalian eryth- rocytes. Hemagglutinin binds with the neuraminic acid (sialic acid) cell receptor, the cell surface glycoprotein receptor, and initiates the infection in the host cell. Adsorption of erythro-cytes occurs at 4\u00b0C, but at 37\u00b0C there is detachment of the red cells due to destruction of the glycoprotein receptors by the viral enzyme, neuraminidase. The hemagglutinin agglutinates certain red blood cells, which is inhibited by the neutralizing antibodies. This forms the basis of the hemagglutination inhi-bition test used in the serodiagnosis of influenza. Hemagglutinin has potency to undergo antigenic variations. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, undergo radical changes in antigenic shift. In antigenic drift, only minor changes take place in the composi-tions of HA antigenic sites.Neuraminidase: The NA is a glycoprotein and tetramer. It consists of 100 mushroom-shaped spikes.The mushroom-shaped NA is inserted into the virus membrane by its hydro-phobic tail end. The distal end contains antigenic as well as enzymatically active sites. The NA causes hydrolysis of N-acetyl neuraminic acid or sialic acid residues present on the glycoprotein receptors on red cells, hence causes elution or detachment of the cells adsorbed to virion particles. The func-tion of the neuraminidase is to cleave the neuraminic acid and to release progeny virions from the infected host cells. The neuraminidase also degrades the mucus layer, thereby exposing the epithelial membrane of the respiratory tract for infection by the virus. All the strains of influenza A, B, and C share the common internal proteins, such as nucleoproteins and membrane proteins. They, however, differ in their surface proteins, such as HAs and NAs. The influenza viruses are further subdivided into subtypes, A0, A1, A2, and A3, and these subtypes into strains. Antigenic variations Antigenic variation is a unique feature of influenza virus. The surface antigens HA and NA show variations and are primarily responsible for antigenic variations exhibited by influenza viruses. The internal RNP antigen and M protein are stable, hence do not contribute to the antigenic varia-tions. Antigenic variations are of two types: antigenic drift.Antigenic shift: The abrupt, drastic, discontinuous change is called the antigenic shift. This occurs due to major antigenic changes in HA or NA antigens, and is caused by replacement of the gene for HA by one coding for a completely different amino acid sequence. The antigenic shift is characterized by alteration of virtually all the antigenic sites of the HA. This occurs inde-pendently in the HA and NA.Antigenic drift: The gradual, sequential, regular antigenic change in influenza virus is known as antigenic drift. This occurs due to minor antigenic changes in the HA or NA occurring at frequent intervals. This is caused even by a single mutation affecting HA glycoprotein. The antigenic drift is characterized by changes in certain epitopes in the HA, while others are being conserved. Differences between antigenic shift and antigenic drift are summarized in Table 61-3. Key Points Influenza A virus shows maximum antigenic variations. Influenza B virus does not undergo antigenic shift because influenza B virus is the only human virus for which there is no animal source of new RNA segments. However, influ-enza B virus undergoes antigenic drift. Antigenic variation never occurs in type C influenza virus. Gene reassortment Because the influenza virus genome is segmented, genetic reassortment can occur when a host cell is infected simultane-ously with viruses of two different parent strains. This process of genetic reassortment accounts for the periodic appearance of the novel types of influenza A strains that cause influenza pandemics. Influenza viruses of animals, such as aquatic birds, chickens, swine, and horses show high host specificity. These animal viruses are the source of the RNA segments that encode the antigenic shift variants that cause epidemics among humans. For example, if a person is infected simultaneously by an avian and human influenza strains, then it is possible that a genetic reassortment could occur in infected cells in humans. The reassortment could lead to emergence of a new human influenza A virus, the progeny of which will contain a mixture of genome segments from the two strains (e.g., a new variant of human influenza A virus bearing the avian virus HA) (Fig. 61-3). Many studies have conclusively demonstrated that the aquatic birds (such as water fowl) are a common source of these new genes. The pigs act as mixing vessels, where these virulent genes of water fowl mix with the genome of influenza virus giving rise to new variant of influenza virus.Antigenic shift Antigenic drift Abrupt, drastic, and discontinuous variation in antigenic structureGradual, sequential, and regular variation at periodic intervals Results in a different strain Related to predecessor strainResults in a new strain Not related to predecessor strain Antigenic drift is due to mutation and selectionAntigenic shift is due to gene reassortment Responsible for epidemics of influenzaResponsible for epidemics as well pandemics 1:05:41 PMSection IV Chapter 61508 VIROLOGY Designation of influenza viruses Influenza virus type A can be classified into subtypes based on the variations in their surface antigens (Table 61-4). The WHO proposed a new system of classification in 1971 and was later modified, which takes into account the nature of both the surface antigens. According to this, the complete designation of a strain will include the (a ) type, (b ) place of origin, (c ) serial number, and (d) year of isolation followed by (e ) antigenic subtypes of the HA and NA in parentheses. For example: influenza A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) indicates that influenza was first originated from Singapore and was isolated for the first time in the year 1957. The HA and NA antigens are H2 and N2 as shown in the parentheses. Other properties Influenza viruses are inactivated by ether, formaldehyde, phe-nol, salts of heavy metals, and common chemical disinfectants. Heating at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes inactivates most strains of the virus. Influenza viruses are resistant to slow drying. They remain viable in dust up to 2 weeks, at /H1100270\u00b0C for a longer period, and by freeze-drying indefinitely.Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Influenza viruses are isolated from respiratory secretions by growing in chick embryos or tissue cultures (monkey kidney or baboon kidney cell lines). Chick embryos The influenza viruses grow in the allantoic and amniotic cavity of the chick embryos. After an incubation period of 3 days, the fluid is tested for hemagglutination activities of the viruses. Cell culture Cell lines are widely used for culture of influenza viruses. They can grow in several primary and continuous cell lines. Rhesus Monkey kidney cell lines (LLC-MK2) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) are the continuous cell lines frequently used to isolate influenza viruses. Laboratory animals Human influenza virus causes experimental infections in a variety of animals. Intracerebral inoculation of mice by neuro-trophic strains produces fatal encephalitis. It causes an acute respiratory disease on intranasal inoculation in ferrets. Pathogenesis and Immunity Influenza virus is transmitted from person to person primarily in droplets released by sneezing and coughing. Pathogenesis of influenza Inhaled influenza viruses reach lower respiratory tract, tra-cheobronchial tree, the primary site of the disease. They attach to sialic acid receptors on epithelial cells by HA pres-ent on the viral envelope. Relatively few viruses are needed to infect lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract. Neuraminidase of the viral envelope may act on the N-acetyl neuraminic acid residues in mucus to produce liq- uefaction. In concert with mucociliary transport, this lique-fied mucus may help spread the virus through the respiratory tract. Infection of mucosal cells results in cellular destruction and desquamation of the superficial mucosa. The resulting edema and mononuclear cell infiltration of the involved areas are accompanied by symptoms including nonproductive cough, sore throat, and nasal discharge. Although the cough may be striking, the most prominent symptoms of influenza are systemic: fever, muscle aches, and general prostration. The virus remains localized to the respiratory tract; hence viremia does not occur. In an uncomplicated case, virus can be recovered from respi- ratory secretions for 3-8 days. Peak quantities of 10 4-107 infec- tious units/mL are detected at the time of maximal illness. After 1-4 days of peak shedding, the titer begins to drop, in concert with the progressive abatement of disease.RNA genome segments reassorted New strain of influenza virusHuman influenza virusChicken influenza virus Lung cell FIG. 61-3.

Pure viral pneumonia of this type is a severe illness with a high mortality. Virus titers in secretions are high, and viral shedding is prolonged. In most cases, however, pneumonia associated with influenza is caused by bacteria, principally pneumococci, staphylococci, and Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria can invade and cause disease, because the preceding viral infection damages the normal defenses of the lung. Host immunity Antibody is the primary defense in immunity to reinfection. IgA antibody, which predominates in upper respiratory secretions, is less persistent than secretory IgG, but contributes to con-fer immunity. Secretory IgG antibody, which predominates in lower respiratory secretions, appears to be the most important. Antibodies provide long-lasting immunity against the infecting influenza strain. Only antibodies directed against HA is able to prevent infection. Antibodies against HA neu-tralizes the infectivity of the virus, thereby preventing the dis-ease. Antibodies against NA do not neutralize infectivity but reduce severity of the disease. They act presumably by impair-ing the action of NA against N-acetyl neuraminic acid residues in the virion envelope and thus promoting virus aggregation. The antibodies against the internal ribonucleoprotein group- specific antigen do not confer any immunity. Immunity to influenza virus is strain-specific and lasts for many years. Recurrent cases of influenza are caused primarily by antigenically different strains. The role of cell-mediated immu-nity in conferring protection against influenza is not clear. Clinical Syndrome The virus causes classic influenza syndrome. Influenza syndrome Incubation period is short (1-3 days). The classic influenza syndrome is a febrile illness of sudden onset, characterized by tracheitis and marked myalgias. Headache, chills, fever, mal-aise, myalgias, anorexia, and sore throat appear suddenly. The body temperature rapidly rises to 101-104\u00b0F (38.3-40.0\u00b0C) and respiratory symptoms ensue. Nonproductive cough is characteristic. Sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction are common. Patients may also report photophobia, hoarseness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They appear acutely ill and are usually coughing. Minimal to moderate nasal obstruc-tion, nasal discharge, and pharyngeal inflammation may be present. Lung examination is usually normal. The viruses mostly cause subclinical infections. They do not display the classic syndrome described above. Moreover, the influenza syndrome is uncommon in children and is not seen in infants. A given patient may exhibit symptoms including pre-dominantly sneezing, nasal obstruction, and nasal discharge (common cold); nasal obstruction, discharge, and sore throat (upper respiratory illness); sore throat with erythema (phar-yngitis); hoarseness (laryngitis); or cough (tracheobronchitis). Fever may be absent. Complications Secondary bacterial infections: Life-threatening influenza is often caused by secondary bacterial infections with staphy-lococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pneumonia may develop as a complication and may be fatal, particularly (a) in elderly persons above 60 years with underlying chronic disease, (b ) in people with impaired resistance (chronic cardiore- spiratory disease, renal disease, etc.), and ( c) in pregnant women. Central nervous system complications: Guillain-Barre syn- drome characterized by encephalomyelitis and polyneuritis is a rare complication of influenza virus infection. This condition was documented in the United States in the year 1976, following extensive vaccination with inactivated H3N2 influenza virus.Other complications: Reye's syndrome is a noted compli-cation of influenza B infection. The condition is seen most commonly in young children and is associated with degenera-tive changes in the brain, liver, and kidney. Epidemiology Influenza occurs worldwide. Geographical distribution Influenza viruses cause epidemic, endemic, and pandemic influenza. Influenza A virus causes epidemics and occasionally pandemics; influenza B virus only causes epidemics; and influ-enza C viruses only cause minor respiratory illness and do not cause any epidemics. Influenza epidemics have been recorded throughout the history. The worst of these was the 1918 pan-demic, which caused about 20 million deaths worldwide and about 500,000 deaths in the United States. In temperate cli-mates, the epidemics typically occur in the winter and cause considerable morbidity in all age groups. Influenza occurs throughout India. The worst, severe pandemic in the year 1918-1919 (Spanish flu) caused nearly 10 million deaths in India. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Infected humans are the main reservoir of infections for influenza A virus. Respiratory secretions of infected persons are the important source of infection. The virus is excreted in respiratory secretions immediately before the onset of ill-ness and for 3-4 days thereafter. Wild aquatic birds are known reservoirs of influenza A. They secrete the viruses in their feces, which contaminates ponds and lakes. The virus is spread from person-to-person primarily by air-borne respiratory droplets released during the acts of sneezing and coughing. Influenza B virus only causes epidemics. Infection is from humans-to-humans. No animal reservoir hosts are known. Chap-61.indd 509 5/14/2012 1:05:42 PMSection IV Chapter 61510 VIROLOGY Influenza C virus only causes minor respiratory illness and does not cause any epidemics. Influenza epidemics and pandemics Influenza epidemics are of two types. Yearly epidemics are caused by both type A and type B viruses. The rare, severe influ-enza pandemics are always caused by type A virus. Antigenic shift and antigenic drift are the two different mechanisms responsible for producing the strains that cause these two types of epidemics.Antigenic shift: A major change in one or both of the surface antigens, a change that yields an antigen showing no serologic relationship with the antigen of the strains prevailing at the time is called antigenic shift. Antigenic shift has been demon-strated in type A influenza virus only. Influenza A virus causes epidemics and occasionally, pan- demics. Pandemics are caused by the virus strains undergoing antigenic shift. Antigenic shift variants appear less frequently, about every 10 or 11 years. It is demonstrated that pandemic strains are the recombinant strains, originated from some ani-mal or bird reservoir, either spreading to humans directly by host range mutation or as a result of a recombination between human and nonhuman strains. The pandemic strains also show the capability to spread rapidly among the population. The completely novel antigens that appear during antigenic shift are acquired by genetic reassortment. The donor of the new antigens is probably an animal influenza virus. Type A viruses have been identified in pigs, horses, and birds, and animal influ-enza viruses possessing antigens closely related to those of human viruses. Fourteen distinct HA and nine NA antigens are known. Since continued surveillance of animal influenza viruses in recent years has failed to discover new antigens, these may represent the full variety of major influenza virus surface antigens (subtypes).Antigenic drift: Repeated minor antigenic changes, on the other hand, generate strains that retain a degree of serologic relationship with the currently prevailing strain. This is called antigenic drift. The epidemics are caused by influenza A virus undergoing antigenic variations due to antigenic drift result-ing from mutations and selections. Antigenic drift variants occur very frequently, virtually every year. This is responsible for emergence of the strains that cause yearly influenza epidem-ics. When persons are reinfected with drift viruses, the serum antibody responses to the surface antigens that are shared with earlier strains to which the person has been exposed are fre-quently stronger and of greater avidity than are the responses to the new antigens. This phenomenon, which has been called \"original antigenic sin\" is sometimes useful in serologic diagnosis. Antigenic drift represents selection for naturally occurring vari-ants under the pressure of population immunity. Influenza A is generally more pathogenic than influenza B. Influenza A is a zoonotic infection and more than 100 types of influenza A viruses have been described which infect birds, pigs, horses, dogs, and seals. The 1918 pandemic of influenza that resulted in millions of human deaths worldwide is believed to have originated from a virulent strain of H1N1 from pigs or birds (Table 61-5). H5N1 bird flu The H5N1 flu, caused by an avian subtype influenza virus, which has been associated with bird flu in the domesti-cated birds, can be transmitted from birds to humans. The H5N1 was first described in Hong Kong in 1997. Human infections caused by this virus were established in only 18 individuals of which six died. Since then, sporadic cases of H5N1 infection continued to be described in southern China. An epidemic of bird flu occurred in domesticated birds in Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam, in January 2004. More than 240 human cases have been documented and more than 140 persons have died due to the poultry outbreaks and bird-to-human transmission. Most deaths have been reported in Vietnam and Indonesia. Sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur since the 2004 outbreak even outside Southeast Asia, including Turkey. Till now, no conclusive evidences are available to show the human-to-human transmission of H5N1. However, scientists are concerned that a slight mutation could con-vert H5N1 to a strain that would be easily transferred from human-to-human. Such a strain, it is believed, could poten-tially spread rapidly and cause a catastrophic worldwide pan-demic. Hence, efforts are currently underway to develop an effective vaccine against H5N1. In addition, the number of drugs that are effective against influenza are being increas-ingly evaluated. Ribavirin has shown activity when tested in animal models. Another avian subtype, H9N2, was described in two young children in March 1999. However, after that despite concern, no further outbreak of H9N2 infection has been documented. Experts are also concerned that a virulent strain of H9N2 influenza similar to H5N1 flu may mutate to allow human-to-human infection and that such a strain may possess the combination of transmissibility, infectivity, and lethality.Period of Swine H1N1 virus 1977 1977-1978H1N1 Reappearance of H1N1 virus (resembling 1950 strain)Progressive antigenic drift Swine H1N1 virusTABLE of antigenic 5/14/2012 PMSection IV Chapter 61ORTHOMYXOVIRUSES 511 novel H1N1 swine origin influenza virus (SOIV) H1N1 emerged in 2009 to produce the first human influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Within 1 year, this virus spread to 214 countries and caused more than 18,000 confirmed deaths worldwide. First described in April 2009, the novel swine origin influenza virus emerged due to a \"triple-reassortment\" of influenza viruses of avian, swine, and human origin. This led to the popular term \"swine flu\" being used for this virus. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus is composed of (a ) PB2 and PA segments from North American avian viruses; (b ) the PB1 segment of the of the H1 sub- type), nucleoprotein (NP) and NS segments derived from classical swine H1N1 viruses, and the neuraminidase (NA; of the N1 subtype), and (d ) M segments of Eurasian \"avian-like\" swine viruses. Unlike previous strains of influenza virus, the novel swine origin influenza virus did not have a predilec-tion for populations more than 60 years of age. Rather, more number of younger people less than 40 years of age were found to be affected. A small percentage of those affected were found to develop pneumonia or acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome. The number of cases decreased greatly by May 2010, and the pandemic was officially declared to be at an end in August 2010. For diagnosis of H1N1 influenza, testing of samples like nasopharyngeal swabs or oropharyn-geal swabs is essential. Real time RT-PCR for viral nucleic acid is the recommended method for its diagnosis, and other rapid tests like antigen detection were not found to be useful. The treatment for severe cases of H1N1 influenza is the neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. Two types of influenza vaccines have been developed against H1N1 influenza\u2014a trivalent inactivated vaccine and a live attenuated influenza vaccine, which can be administered intranasally. Laboratory Diagnosis During an epidemic of influenza, the clinical diagnosis can be made, but definitive diagnosis depends on the laboratory methods. Specimens Specimens include nasal or throat washings or sputum for viral antigen and viral RNA, throat gargles for isolation of viruses, and serum for viral antibodies. Direct antigen detection A rapid, specific diagnosis of influenza is made by demonstrating viral antigens directly on cells obtained from the nasopharynx. Immunofluorescence (IF) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using specific monoclonal antibodies are used commercially to detect viral antigen. The results of the rapid tests are useful to start treatment with the NA inhibitors within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. Isolation of the virus Throat gargles are the specimen of choice. The specimen is collected in saline broth or a buffered salt solution and is sent immediately to the laboratory, or if delayed is stored at /H110024\u00b0C. The virus is isolated from the specimen by inoculation into embryonated eggs or into certain cell cultures.Egg inoculation: The specimen is inoculated into the amni-otic cavity of the chick embryo. After incubation at 35\u00b0C for 3 days, the amniotic fluid and allantoic fluid are harvested and tested for the presence of viral HA. This is carried out by using fowl and guinea pig red cells in parallel and incubating at room temperature and at 4\u00b0C. Usually, influenza A viruses aggluti-nate only guinea pig cells, influenza B both fowl and guinea pig red cells, and influenza C agglutinate only fowl cells at 4\u00b0C. If the test is positive, the isolate is then typed by a serological test (e.g., hemagglutination inhibition test) using specific anti-sera to types A, B, and C.Cell culture: Influenza virus is usually isolated from respira-tory secretions by growing in tissue cultures (monkey kidney or baboon kidney cell lines). The cell cultures are incubated at 33\u00b0C in the roller drums in the presence of trypsin, but without serum. Virus growth in tissue cultures is detected by direct demon- stration of viral antigen in infected cell cultures by IF or by testing for hemadsorption with human O, fowl, and guinea pig red cells. In a positive hemadsorption test, red cells adhere to the virus budding from infected cells. If the culture tests positive, serologic tests with specific antisera may be used to identify the virus. Serodiagnosis Demonstration of a rise in serum antibody titer between acute-phase and convalescent-phase sera by test is diag-nostic of infection. The acute-phase sera are collected within a few days of illness and the convalescent sera 7-10 days after the illness. Complement fixation tests (CFTs) with RNP antigens of influenza types A, B, and C and also the CFTs with V anti-gens are employed for demonstration of rising antibody titer in the paired sera samples. Hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme neutralization test, radial immunodiffusion test, and ELISA are the other tests also used for demonstration of antibodies. However, none of these techniques are useful to identify all infections. Various approaches followed for laboratory diagnosis of influenza are summarized in Table 61-6. Molecular Diagnosis Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is used recently for the detection of viral nucleic acid in the nasopha-ryngeal cells for diagnosis of influenza. Treatment Amantadine and rimantadine are the specific antiviral agents available for treatment of influenza. These drugs are effective against influenza A virus but not against influenza B virus. Chap-61.indd 511 5/14/2012 1:05:42 PMSection IV Chapter 61512 VIROLOGY These drugs when given within 1-2 days of the onset of illness, reduce severity of the disease and also hasten the disappearance of fever and other symptoms. The drugs are recommended for prevention of influenza in elderly unimmunized population in whom the influenza can cause a life-threatening infection. Emergence of viral resistance can occur during treatment. Zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are newer drugs for treatment of influenza and are effective against both influenza A and B viruses. These are the NA inhibitors, which act by inhibiting the release of viruses from infected cells. These drugs also prevent the spread of virus from one cell to another. Relenza is used in the form of nasal spray, whereas Tamiflu is given orally. Prevention and Control This is based on the following: 1. Immunoprophylaxis by vaccines 2. Chemoprophylaxis Immunoprophylaxis by vaccines Influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are most common pre-vailing human influenza viruses. The trivalent vaccine used worldwide contains influenza A strains from H1N1 and H3N2, along with an influenza B strain. Influenza virus vaccines have been used for about 40 years to prevent influenza, primarily influenza A and B. Following types of vaccines are used:Inactivated vaccines: Initially inactivated vaccines were used. The viruses for these vaccines are grown in chick embryos, inac-tivated by formalin, purified to some extent, and adjusted to a dosage known to elicit an antibody response in most individu-als. The vaccines contain the strains of types A and B viruses that are believed most likely to produce epidemics during the following winter. The vaccine is administered parenterally. One or two doses are required, depending on the immune experience of the pop-ulation with related antigens. The vaccines are recommended especially for persons at high risk, especially those over 65 years of age and those with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases.Local and systemic reactions to the vaccine are minor and occur in the first day or two after vaccination. In some persons, the vaccine may cause reactions allergic to egg proteins pres-ent in the vaccine. The killed vaccines do not induce formation of secretory antibodies in the secretory mucosa, although they elicit production of specific protective antibodies in the serum.Live attenuated vaccines: Live attenuated vaccines are now being developed as alternatives to inactivated vaccines. These vaccines induce production of specific secretory antibodies in respiratory mucosa. Earlier, the live vaccine used the viruses that were attenuated by repeated egg passage and was given by intranasal instillation. But these vaccines often failed to protect the children from clinical disease. Recently, temperature-sen-sitive (ts) mutant strains have been used in the live attenuated vaccine preparations. These avirulent mutants are able to grow at 32-34\u00b0C in the nasopharyngeal secretions, but not at 37\u00b0C in the lungs. These vaccines are useful to protect the children from clinical disease. Table 61-7 summarizes vaccines available against influenza virus. Vaccines Recombinant vaccines: Recombinant vaccines using recombinant strains are now being evaluated in influenza. Recombinant strains are produced by hybridization between the ts mutants and new antigenic variants of the strains. These strains carry the surface antigens of the new vari-ants and growth properties of the old established strains. The recombinant vaccines are indicated most importantly for immunoprophylaxis of a new strain of influenza virus, threatening to cause pandemics of influenza. Chemoprophylaxis Chemoprophylaxis by amantadine and rimantadine hydrochlo-ride has been shown to be more successful. These two drugs effectively prevent infection and illness caused by type A, but not by type B viruses (because they lack M2 components). The persons with high risk can be protected by administering in a Method Test Detection Direct antigen detection IF, ELISA Influenza virus antigen in respiratory secretions Virus isolation Cell culture Primary monkey kidney cell,Madin-Darby canine kidney cell, and hemadsorption to infected cellsLimited cytopathic effects Presence of HA protein on cell surface Chick embryo Allantoic and amniotic cavity Fluid is tested for inhibition, Hemadsorption serum antibody titer Molecular diagnosis RT-PCR Viral nucleic acid in the nasopharyngeal cells ELISA, reaction.TABLE 61-6 infection Chap-61.indd 512 5/14/2012 1:05:42 PMSection IV Chapter 61ORTHOMYXOVIRUSES 513 There was a scare of bird flu infections in poultry birds in Maharashtra during 2006.

These antiviral agents prevent about 50% of infections and about 67% of illnesses under natural conditions. When administered for 10 days to household contacts of a person with influenza, these drugs protect up to 80% of the persons from illness. Side effects are greater for amantadine but are lim-ited to the central nervous system. Chap-61.indd 513 5/14/2012 1:05:42 PM62 Introduction Paramyxoviruses are roughly spherical-shaped viruses and usually vary in size from 100 to 300 nm. Sometimes, long filaments and giant forms of the virus measuring up to 800 nm are also found. These viruses consist of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome enclosed in a helical nucleocap-sid a pleomorphic envelope. Paramyxoviruses resemble orthomyxoviruses in morphology but are larger, sur-face spikes are different, and their genomes are not segmented (see Table 62-1). Classification The family Paramyxoviridae consists of three important genera (Morbillivirus, Paramyxovirus, and Pneumovirus), which contain important human pathogens responsible for causing most of acute respiratory infections and contagious diseases of children and infants. Paramyxoviruses The genus Morbillivirus includes the measles virus. The genus Paramyxovirus includes parainfluenza and mumps virus. The genus Pneumovirus includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is responsible for majority of acute respiratory infections in infants and children. The nucleocapsid is associated with the nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase phosphoprotein (P), and larger (L) protein. The NP maintains genomic structure, the P facilitates RNA synthesis, and the L protein is an RNA polymerase. The nucleocapsid surrounded by envelope has the matrix (M) protein at its base. The virion envelope contains two glycoproteins, a fusion (F) protein and a viral attachment protein called hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN), hemagglutinin (H), or G protein. The F protein facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell mem-branes, and HN promotes adsorption of the virus to the host cell surface. The F protein is activated by proteolytic cleav-age, resulting in the production of F1 and F2 glycopeptides held together by disulfide bond to express membrane-fusing activities. The binding of the HN, H, or G protein on the virion enve- lope to these cell surface glycoproteins containing sialic acid is the first step in the replication of paramyxoviruses. This is followed by the fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the cell, promoted by the F protein of the virion envelope. In addition, paramyxovirus also induces cell-to-cell fusion, resulting in production of multinucleated giant cells. Paramyxoviruses associated with human diseases are summa-rized in Table 62-1. Measles Virus Measles is a highly communicable acute viral disease charac-terized by fever, conjunctivitis, and pathognomonic Koplik's spots. It is one of the five classic exanthematous diseases of the childhood; others being chickenpox, rubella, roseola, and fifth disease. General Properties Morphology Mumps syncytial virus Up per respiratory tract infection, common cold; lower respiratory tract illness, resulting in bronchiolitis or pneumonia in infants Nipah virus Encephalitis Hendra virus Zoonotic paramyxovirusSevere respiratory disease and respiratory tract disease in children and adults Human metapneumovirus Respiratory pathogen first detected using a is often pleomorphic, measur-ing 120-250 nm in contains a negative-sense RNA genome. The helical nucleocapsid is surrounded by an envelope carrying H and F protein on its surface. The virus causes hemagglutination of monkey erythrocytes, but it is not followed by elution as the virus does not produce any neuraminidase activity. Viral replication Measles virus replicates in the cell cytoplasm. The virus first adsorbs cell surface by its hemagglutinin, then enters the cell, and uncoats inside the cytoplasm of the cell. The viral RNA polymerase transcribes the negative-strand genome into mRNA. Multiple copies of mRNAs are produced, each of which is translated into specific viral proteins. This is followed by the assembly of nucleocapsid, and the virus is released by budding from the cell membrane. Antigenic and genomic properties The measles virus has only one serotype and infects only humans, not any other mammals. The virus is antigenically uniform; it shares antigens with canine distemper virus. Other properties The measles virus is heat labile. It is readily inactivated by ether, formaldehyde, high temperature, and ultraviolet light. The virus is stabilized by molar MgSO 4 following which the virus resists heating at 50\u00b0C for 1 hour. Virus Isolation Culture The measles virus is very difficult to grow, although it can be grown in primary human or monkey kidney cell cultures. The isolates can be adapted for growth on HeLa or Vero cell lines. Characteristic cytopathological effects include multinucle-ated giant cells with cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusion bod-ies. Warthin-Finkeldey cells are the multinucleated giant cells produced by measles virus in lymphoid tissue of the patients. These giant cells are produced as a result of the F proteins in the spikes. Pathogenesis and Immunity Measles is highly contagious and is spread from person to person by aerosols. It enters the susceptible host by the respira-tory route. Pathogenesis of measles The virus initiates infection and replicates locally in the trachea and bronchial epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. After 2-4 days, the virus spreads systemically in lymphocytes, perhaps carried by pulmonary macrophages, and causes viremia. Wide dissemination of the virus causes infection of the conjunctiva, respiratory tract, urinary tract, lymphatic system, blood ves-sels, and the central nervous system (CNS). The characteristic rash seen in measles is caused primarily by cytotoxic T cells attacking the measles virus-infected epithelial cells in the skin. Key Points Encephalitis is one of the most important sequelae of the infection caused by measles. The virus causes: encephalitis by direct infection of the neurons; immune-mediated conditions, such as postinfectious mea-sles (SSPE) caused by an infective mutant of measles, produced during the acute stage of the disease. Host immunity Measles causes immunosuppression, characterized by decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes (both B and T cells) and depres-sion of their response to activation by mitogens. Also, the con-dition is associated with marked decrease in interleukin-12 production and leads to antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses that are present for weeks to months after the acute infection. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays an important role to control measles infection. Therefore, measles virus in individu-als with deficiency in cellular immunity causes progressive and often fatal giant cell pneumonia without a rash. The antibodies do not have any role in conferring protection against measles virus, because the viruses spread from cell to cell. However, maternal antibodies in infants protect against measles during first 6 months of life. Immunosuppression caused by measles in the infected indi- viduals may predispose individuals to bronchopneumonia, a severe bacterial infection and a major cause of measles-related mortality among young children. Nevertheless, one attack of measles confers lifelong immunity. Clinical Syndromes Measles virus is associated with the following clinical syn-dromes: period varies from 8 to 12 days. Measles is a highly contagious febrile illness. The prodromal phase is character-ized by high fever, malaise, anorexia, conjunctivitis, cough, and coryza. Koplik's spot is the typical pathogenic lesion found in the mucous membrane.Koplik's spots: These are bluish gray specks or grain sub-stance on a red base, which usually appear on the buccal mucosa opposite the second molar. They appear at the end of Chap-62.indd 515 5/14/2012 1:05:06 PMSection IV Chapter 62516 VIROLOGY prodrome, just before the appearance of rash. These Koplik's spots may also appear on the mucous membrane of the con-junctiva and vagina. Koplik's spots usually appear after 2 days of illness. These spots, which last for 24-48 hours, are pathog-nomonic of measles. Their presence establishes the diagnosis of measles. An erythematous maculopapular rash appears within 12-24 hours of appearance of the Koplik's spots. The rash usu- ally begins on the face, then spreads extensively and appears on the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles and lasts for about 5 days. Desquamation of the rashes except those of palms and soles may occur after 1 week. Patients appear highly sick during the first or second day of the appearance of the rash. The rash is typically absent in patients with defective CMI. Generalized lymphade-nopathy and mild hepatomegaly may also occur in some patients.Complications of measles: Complications include otitis media, bronchopneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), and diarrhea. Bronchopneumonia is a most serious condition and is responsible for 60% of deaths caused by measles virus. Hepatitis, encephalitis, and SSPE are the rare complications. Encephalitis is one of the most dangerous complications and occurs approximately in one of every 1000 patients. Measles causes death mostly in children younger than 5 years. It causes high mortality in (i) infants between 4 and 12 months and (ii) children who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other diseases. Atypical measles Atypical measles is a syndrome that has been described in peo-ple who were infected with measles virus after immunization with the older, killed measles vaccine used during 1963-1977. This condition also occurs, but rarely, in individuals vaccinated with attenuated virus vaccine. The condition is characterized by a prolonged high fever, pneumonitis, and the rash. The rash characteristically begins peripherally and may be urti-carial, maculopapular, hemorrhagic, or vesicular. The condi-tion appears to be immune mediated and to occur as a result of hypersensitivity to measles virus in a partially immune host. This condition is associated with a low measles antibody titer early in the course of infection but a very high measles IgG anti-body titer during the of the CNS caused by persistent measles infection. It is the most serious and late neurological sequelae of mea-sles that affects the CNS. The disease is characterized by the development of behavioral and intellectual deterioration and seizures after many years (mean incubation period is 10.8 years) of infection by measles. The condition occurs in about seven in every 1 million patients. The condition occurs most commonly in children who were initially affected when they were younger than 2 years. The condition is associated with the presence of an extremely high measles antibody titer in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).Epidemiology Measles is a disease reported throughout the world. Geographical distribution Epidemics of measles occur every 2-3 years. Approximately, 30 million cases of measles are reported annually, most cases being from Africa. The condition has also been well docu-mented in the America, Europe, Eastern Mediterranean region, Western Pacific region, and Southeast Asia. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Measles is exclusively a human disease. Infected respiratory droplets are the primary source of infection. Patients are infec-tious from 3 days before the onset of illness until the rash desquamates. Infectivity is maximum at the prodrome and diminishes rapidly with the onset of the rash. The infection is transmitted from person to person by inhalation of large drop-let aerosols produced during the act of coughing and sneezing. Children with immunodeficiency due to leukemia, cortico- steroid therapy, or HIV are at increased risk for infection regard-less of their status of immunization. Unvaccinated people are also at risk. The condition is most commonly seen in children living in crowded condition. Laboratory Diagnosis The clinical manifestations of typical measles cases are so char-acteristic that the diagnosis is self-evident. The laboratory diag-nosis is frequently helpful to diagnose atypical measles and to differentiate from rubella. Specimens Respiratory specimens, conjunctival specimens, urine, blood, and brain tissues are the frequently used specimens. The respiratory specimens and blood collected during the prodromal stage and the period following until 2 days after the appearance of the rash are the specimens of choice for isolation of viruses by culture. Microscopy Demonstration of multinucleated giant cells, measuring up to 100 nm in diameter, in Giemsa-stained smears is diagnos-tic of measles (Fig. 62-1, Color Photo 58). These giant cells can be demonstrated in biopsies of Koplik's spots, nasal secretion smears, and in dermal rashes. Direct can be nasal secretions, pharyngeal secretions, or in urinary sediments by direct immunofluores-cence antibody test. Isolation of the virus The measles virus is difficult to isolate, but it can be grown in primary human or monkey kidney cell cultures. The virus pro-duces cytopathic effects (CPEs) very slowly, usually 1 week after 516 5/14/2012 1:05:06 PMSection IV Chapter 62PARAMYXOVIRUSES 517 inoculation. The viral antigen appearing in the infected cell cultures, however, can be detected much earlier by using direct immunofluorescence antibody test. Serodiagnosis Sandwich capture IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM ELISA) is the quickest method to diagnose acute measles by detection of IgM antibodies in the serum. The IgM antibod-ies begin to appear in the serum on the third day after appear-ance of rash and remain positive 30-60 days after illness in most individuals suffering from measles. The test is therefore positive during these days. IgM ELISA is highly sensitive (nearly 100%) during this period of illness. The IgM antibody is usually not positive in the first 2 days after appearance of rash; in some individuals, IgM antibodies may become negative 30 days after the onset of rash. Demonstration of more than fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera confirms diagnosis of measles. IgG antibodies usually appear 4 days after the onset of rash and persist for a longer period even after the patient has been cured of the illness. Demonstration of unusually high titer of measles antibody in the serum and CSF is diagnostic of SSPE. Treatment Ribavirin given either intravenous or in aerosol form is being now evaluated to treat severely affected adults and immuno-compromised individuals with acute measles or SSPE. Measles virus has been shown to be susceptible to ribavirin in vitro. However, the drug is yet to be used for regular treatment of cases of measles, since no controlled trials have been conducted to test the efficacy of the drug in patients with measles. Prevention and Control Measles vaccine along with mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is currently used for universal immunization of children. Serum human gamma globulin, if administered within 6 days of exposure to measles, may prevent or attenuate the disease. This is of immense value in children with immunode-ficiency, in pregnant women, and in others at increased risk to measles. Vaccines Measles vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, which now uses Schwartz and Moraten attenuated strain of the original Edmonston B strain. The first dose of vaccine is given to children older than 12 months in the United States, but are used for children aged 9 months in developing countries like India with high endemicity. The second dose of the vaccine is given usually to school-going children aged 4-6 years. Immunization with two doses of vaccine has shown a sero-conversion of 99% after 1 year. Parainfluenza Virus Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are the pathogens that primarily affect young children; in whom the viruses cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The nomenclature and taxonomic relationship of HPIVs have changed consider-ably over the last decade. These are now composed of five sero-types: HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4a, and HPIV-4b. Respirovirus HPIV-3) and the genus of the viruses (HPIVs) following features: HPIVs are pleomorphic viruses measuring 150-200 in contains a single-stranded, nonsegmented, nega-tive-sense RNA genome with nucleoproteins P and L. It is surrounded by a helical nucleocapsid, which contains glyco-protein spikes. The surface spikes consist of H, N (neuraminidase), and F proteins. Both H and N proteins are present on the same spike, whereas the F protein is present on a separate spike. The F protein mediates the formation of multinucleated giant cell. Viral replication Viral replication of the parainfluenza viruses is similar to that of measles virus. Antigenic and genomic properties The 62518 VIROLOGY Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Cell culture Human parainfluenza viruses grow in primary monkey kidney (PMK) cells (Rhesus and African green monkeys). The virus also grows in continuous monkey kidney cell lines (LLC-MK2), which is excellent for continuous passage and almost as good as PMK cells for primary isolation. Pathogenesis and Immunity Human parainfluenza virus infection is limited to respiratory tract. Respiratory epithelium appears to be the important site of virus binding and subsequent infection. Pathogenesis of human parainfluenza viruse infection The virus adsorbs to the respiratory epithelial cells by spe-cifically combining with neuraminic acid receptors in the cell through its hemagglutinin. Subsequently, the virus enters the cells following fusion with the cell membrane, mediated by F1 and F2 receptors. The virus replicates more rapidly than mumps and measles viruses in the cell cytoplasm and causes formation of multinucleated giant cells. These giant cells, each of which contains two to seven nuclei, usually develop late in the infection. The virus also causes the formation of single and multilocular cytoplasmic vacuoles and basophilic or eosino-philic inclusions. The virus causes inflammation of the respiratory tract, lead- ing to secretions of high level of inflammatory cytokines, usu-ally 7-10 days after initial exposure. Airways inflammation, necrosis, and sloughing of respiratory epithelium, edema, and excessive mucus production are the noted pathological features associated with HPIV infections. Host immunity Humoral immunity plays a major role in defense against HPIVs. The antibodies are produced against both surface glycoproteins (HN and F) of the virus. Neutralizing antibodies to all the five types of the viruses are seen in most of the children at the time of birth; but the titer falls rapidly after 6 months. Most children and adults develop detectable level of neutralizing antibodies in the serum following natural infection with the virus. Secretory IgA antibodies also appear to play an important role. The CMI appears to play some role in containing the dis-ease, as HPIV infection tends to be more severe in persons with defective CMI. Immunity to HPIV is long-lasting, but reinfection may occur many times throughout the life, most probably due to the pres-ence of multiple serotypes of HPIV. Clinical Syndromes Human parainfluenza viruses cause croup, bron-chiolitis tracheobronchitis, and some other infections. Croup Croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is a heterogeneous group of illnesses that affects the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The condition manifests as fever, obstruction, and expiratory stridor. HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and com-mon causes of croup; of which HPIV-1 is the most common. Pneumonia HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 are responsible for most cases of human parainfluenza pneumonia. Fever, rales, and evidence of pulmo-nary consolidation are the common symptoms. Bronchiolitis and tracheobronchitis Bronchiolitis is caused by all the five types of HPIV, but HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 are the most common causes. Most cases of bronchi-olitis occur in infants. The condition manifests as fever, expira-tory wheezing, tachypnea, and rales. HPIV-3 is more commonly associated with tracheobronchitis HPIV-1 HPIV-2. Other infections Otitis media, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and coryza are the other infections caused by HPIV. Epidemiology Human parainfluenza viruses are ubiquitous. Geographical distribution HPIVs (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4) have worldwide distribution. HPIV-1 is usually associated with epidemics of the disease. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Parainfluenza viruses cause disease exclusively in humans. No animal reservoirs are present. Respiratory secretions from the infected humans are the source of infection. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of respiratory droplets or by direct person-to-person contact with infected secretions. Key Points HPIV-1 causes the largest, most common outbreaks of parainfluenza virus infections. Outbreaks of infection with HPIV-2 usually follow HPIV-1 infection. HPIV-3 infections cause outbreaks mainly in spring and summer. HPIV-4 is infrequently isolated. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal aspirations, washings, and detection The ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, and fluoroimmuno-assays are used to detect HPIV antigen directly in urine speci-mens. These methods are sensitive and specific. Shell viral assay is a sensitive method for rapid demonstration of the virus. Isolation of the virus Cell culture: The virus can be isolated from clinical speci-mens by culture in PMK and LLC-MK2 cell lines. The CPEs are rarely demonstrated during primary isolation of the virus in tissue culture with exception of HPIV-2. The latter causes formation of syncytium in the infected cells. Hemadsorption inhibition using guinea pig erythrocytes is also used for detection of virus antigen in cell lines within 3-10 days of incubation. Serodiagnosis Hemagglutination inhibition, neutralization, ELISA, and Western blot are frequently used antibody-based serological tests for diagnosis of HPIV infection. A fourfold rise in antibody titer of acute and convalescent sera is diagnostic of acute infection. Molecular Diagnosis A multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed for simultaneous detection of HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3 genome in clinical specimens. Treatment Ribavirin has been shown to be effective against HPIV infection in vitro. Uses of ribavirin aerosols or systemic therapy for treat-ment of HPIV infection in children and adults who are severely immunocompromised have shown mixed results with uncer-tain clinical benefit. Prevention and Control Live attenuated vaccine is available. Field trials of formalin-killed whole HPIV (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, and HPIV-3) have proved to be ineffective in children. These vaccines failed to protect against natural infection by parainfluenza virus. Mumps Virus Mumps is an acute infectious disease of children, character-ized by acute, nonsuppurative, painful swelling of the salivary glands, caused by mumps virus. Properties of the Virus Morphology Mumps virus shows following features: Mumps virus is a typical paramyxovirus containing a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA surrounded by an envelope. It has two major surface glycoproteins: (a) one with both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and (b) the other with cell-fusion protein. The hemagglutinin agglutinates the RBCs of fowl, guinea pigs, humans, and many other species. The hemagglutina-tion is followed by hemolysis and elution at 37\u00b0C. The F protein is responsible for fusion of lipid membrane of the virus to the host cell. Viral replication Viral replication is similar to that of measles virus. Antigenic and genomic properties Only one antigenic type of mumps virus is known. Neutralizing antibodies are produced against the hemagglutinin. It has an internal nucleocapsid soluble (S) antigen, which is detected by the complement fixation test. Other properties The mumps virus is a heat-labile virus. It is sensitive to heat and rapidly inactivated at room temperature. Treatment with form-aldehyde, ether, or ultraviolet light also inactivates the virus. The virus can be stored for a longer period by lyophilization at /H1100270\u00b0C. Virus Isolation Cell culture The virus grows well in PMK tissue culture, Hep-2 cells, and H292 cells. The CPE consists of multinucleated giant cells and acidophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. The growth of virus in the cells can be detected by direct immunofluorescence and hemadsorption. The virus also grows well in amniotic cavity of 6-8 days' old embryonated egg. Pathogenesis and Immunity Pathogenesis of mumps Infection by mumps virus begins after the entry of the virus into the respiratory tract. The virus then replicates locally and disseminates by blood circulation to target tissues, such as the CNS and salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands. The virus causes infection of the parotid gland either through Stensen's duct or by viremia. such as parotid glands, show desquamation of necrotic epithelial cells lining the ducts. The virus replicates in these target tissues and then causes a secondary phase of viremia. The virus is spread by viremia throughout the body to kidneys, testes, ovary, pancreas, and other organs. Infection of the CNS, especially meninges, causes Chapter 62520 VIROLOGY Host immunity Humoral immunity is characterized by the appearance of anti-body against the soluble S antigen and hemagglutinating anti-bodies. The antibody against S antigen is the first to appear, within 3-7 days after the onset of symptoms. The hemagglu-tinating antibodies directed against hemagglutinin confer lifelong immunity against mumps virus. CMI is essential for control of infection. This also contributes to pathogenesis of the disease and is responsible partially for the symptoms observed during the course of clinical illness. Immunity in mumps is lifelong. Clinical Syndrome Mumps virus causes mumps. Mumps The incubation period is long and varies from 12 to 25 days. Most of the infections are asymptomatic. The onset of mumps is sudden. Key Points Fever, headache, and earache are the initial symptoms. These symptoms are followed by painful swelling of the parotid gland. Initially, it may be unilateral but may become bilateral later. The condition is accompanied by fever, local pain, and tenderness. Epididymo-orchitis is the second most common manifes-tation in adults, which is usually preceded by parotitis. Orchitis may occasionally cause testicular atrophy and sterility.Complications of mumps: Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent complication of mumps in childhood. Other rare complications include oophoritis, mastitis, pancreatitis, thy-roiditis, arteritis, thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia. Death due mumps is rare. Epidemiology Mumps is a highly communicable disease, occurring worldwide. Geographical distribution Mumps continues to remain endemic in many countries throughout the world, as the mumps vaccine is used in only 57% of the countries. In the absence of vaccination program, it often occurs as epidemics in children 5-15 years of age. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Humans are the only natural hosts of the mumps virus. No animal hosts are present. The infected patients are the source of infection. A patient remains infectious usually from 9 days prior to the onset of parotid swelling as long as 7 days after onset of the swelling. The infection is transmitted by direct person-to-person contact and also by inhalation of respiratory droplets. The unvaccinated people and immunocompromised people are at more risk to infection by mumps virus. Laboratory Diagnosis Diagnosis of mumps is usually clinical. The laboratory diagno-sis is useful for diagnosis of atypical infection or manifestation of mumps without typical symptoms. Specimens The specimens include the saliva, urine, secretions from Stensen's duct, and the CSF. The virus is present in the saliva for 4-5 days, in the CSF for 8-9 days, and in the urine for 15 days after the onset of the symptoms. Isolation of the virus Egg inoculation: Egg inoculation is another method, but is a less sensitive method than the cell culture. The viruses can be detected in the amniotic fluid, after inoculating 6-8 days' old embryonated egg. The virus is identified fluid 5-6 be isolated from clinical speci-mens by inoculation into monkey kidney cells, human amnion cells, or HeLa cells. The growth of the virus in monkey kidney cells is detected by the presence of multinucleated giant cells. The CPE may take as long as 1-2 weeks to appear. Virus growth in the cells can be detected much earlier by hemadsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes adsorbing the surface of virus-infected cells. Immunofluorescence test is also a very rapid test used to 1 2 3 4 5Entry into respiratory tract Spread to local lymph nodes Spread to distant lymph nodes and spleen Viremia Generalized spread to salivary and other glands, and to other body sitesDisease Incubation periodDays5 10 15 62PARAMYXOVIRUSES 521 detect viral antigen in the infected cells as early as 2-3 days after inoculation. Serodiagnosis The hemagglutinin inhibition, immunofluorescence assay, and ELISA are used for demonstration of viral antibodies in the serum. Detection of mumps-specific IgM antibody by IgM ELISA indicates recent and active infection. A fourfold increase between acute and convalescent phases in serum IgM antibody levels confirms the diagnosis of mumps. Treatment No specific antiviral agents are available against mumps. Prevention and Control To achieve and maintain high immunization levels, primarily in infants and young children, is the principal strategy to pre-vent mumps. Vaccines An effective live attenuated vaccine is available against mumps. The vaccine consists of the Jeryl-Lynn strain of mumps virus attenuated by serial passage in eggs and chick fibroblasts. The vaccine confers 95% protection, which lasts for as long as 12 years. The vaccine is recommended for use in children of both sexes, at 12 months of age. The vaccine can be given to all asymptomatic HIV-infected children at the same age. It is given as a part of MMR vaccine. The vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with severe febrile illness. Respiratory Syncytial Virus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respira-tory tract infection in infants and young children. Properties of the Virus Morphology Respiratory syncitial virus shows following features: It is pleomorphic and measures from 150 to 300 nm in size. It has a small nucleocapsid, measuring 13 nm in diameter, unlike large nucleocapsid (18 nm) of other paramyxoviruses. The viral envelope contains a surface glycoprotein G, by which it is attached to the cell surface of the host cells. It contains F protein but lacks both H and N proteins. The F protein induces the fusion of the infected cells with adjoining cells, resulting in the formation of large multinu-cleated syncytia, from which the virus derives its name. Differences between morphology of RSV and other paramyxo-viruses are summarized in Table 61-1. Viral replication Viral replication is similar to that of measles virus. Antigenic and genomic properties The virus is antigenically stable. It has only one antigenic sero-type with the subtypes A and B. Subtype A appears to be more virulent than the subtype B. Other properties The virus is highly labile; it is easily inactivated by dryness at room temperature and by acid. It is preserved by lyophilization. Virus Isolation Cell culture Respiratory syncytial virus is difficult to grow in cell culture in PMK or in human cell (HeLa cells, Hep-2) lines. Formation of large multinucleated syncytia is the characteristic CPE produced by the virus, but slowly in 2-10 days. Pathogenesis and Immunity Respiratory syncytial virus infection is restricted to the respira-tory tract. The virus initiates infection in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. Spread of the virus down the respi-ratory tract occurs by cell-to-cell transfer of the virus along the syncytia from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respira-tory tract, resulting in pneumonia. The virus usually does not cause any viremia or systemic spread. The virus causes necrosis of the small airway epithelium, plugging of the lumens with exudates, and edema, leading to obstruction of the normal air-ways of the young infants. The host's immune response plays a major role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis observed during the period of illness. Host immunity Humoral antibody plays a minimal role in the host immunity against RSV. Maternal antibodies do not protect the infant from infection. CMI appears to play an important role in recov-ery from infection. Natural infection by RSV does not prevent reinfection by the virus. Clinical Syndromes Respiratory syncytial virus primarily causes infection of the respiratory tract, ranging from common cold to pneumonia. Common cold The illness begins with infection of the upper respiratory tract, which manifests as common cold with marked rhinorrhea (running nose). This condition is most common in older chil-dren and adults. Incubation period varies from 4 to 5 days. Bronchiolitis In infants, RSV causes a more severe lower respiratory tract illness, resulting in bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Clinically, the condition presents as cough, coryza, wheezing, rales, and Bronchiolitis is usually self-limiting, but may cause a serious disease in premature infants, in immu-nocompromised hosts, and in individuals with underlying lung diseases. Reinfection with the virus occurs throughout the life. However, with advancing age and recurrent infection, the RSV infection is confined more to the upper respiratory tract than the lower respiratory tract. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Respiratory syncytial virus infection is prevalent worldwide. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Respiratory syncytial virus is highly contagious. Humans are the only hosts. Infected patients are the source of infection. They continue to excrete viruses for several days or weeks in their respiratory secretions. The infection is transmitted: usually by inhalation of large droplet aerosols, coughed out by the patient during the act of coughing or sneezing. also by direct contact with contaminated hands and fomites. The virus is highly prevalent in young infants and children, with a peak incidence in 2-8 months' old infants. Virtually all children are infected by RSV by the age of 4 years. The viral infection is usually seasonal and mostly occurs during winter. Nosocomial infections caused by the virus are frequent in nurs-eries and pediatric ward. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include respiratory secretions obtained by washing, suc-tioning, or swabbing of the nasopharynx. Direct antigen detection The viral antigens in the nasal washings or nasopharyngeal aspirates can be detected by using ELISA or direct immunoflu-orescence antibody test using specific monoclonal antibodies. Isolation of the virus The virus can be isolated from clinical specimens by inocula-tion of HeLa cells, Hep-2 cells, or monkey kidney cells. After 2-10 days of incubation, RSV is identified by the character-istic syncytium formation in the cells. Direct immunofluo-rescence can also be used to detect viral antigen in infected cells. Serodiagnosis The ELISA is used for demonstration of antibodies in the serum. Demonstration of a fourfold or more increase in the antibody titer of acute and convalescent sera confirms the diagnosis of infection.Treatment Ribavirin, antiviral agent, has been recom-mended for the aerosolized treatment of children with severe RSV disease. This has shown beneficial effect by decreasing the duration of illness and decreasing the shedding of viruses in respiratory secretions. Prevention and Control Passive immunization with anti-RSV immunoglobulin has proved beneficial for use for prophylaxis in high-risk infants such as premature babies or babies with chronic lung dis-ease. The anti-RSV immunoglobulin is a pooled polyclonal human immunoglobulin product with high titers of RSV antibodies. Attempts to use a vaccine against RSV have been proved unsuccessful to date. Previously, a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was used in children, but the children who received this vaccine developed more severe disease than those who were exposed to natural RSV infection; hence, this vaccine is no lon-ger used. Recently, a live attenuated RSV vaccine that can be used as nasal spray is under evaluation. Nipah Virus Nipah virus was reported to be the causative agent of encephali-tis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998 and 1999. People rearing pig populations were increasingly susceptible to encephalitis to this previously unrecognized virus. No specific antiviral agent or vaccine is available against Nipah virus. Hendra Virus Hendra virus is a recently described, new paramyxovirus. Hendra virus was first isolated from the cases of severe respi-ratory disease in Hendra, Australia, in 1994; hence the name Hendra virus. Infection is transmitted from infected horses to humans. Fruit bats are the natural reservoir. No specific antivi-ral agent or vaccine is available against Hendra virus. Human Metapneumovirus Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly described virus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The virus was first reported as a cause of respiratory illness in children in 2001. The clinical manifestations of HMPV are closely similar to that of RSV infection in children. Human metapneumovirus like other members of the family Paramyxoviridae is a single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is a respiratory pathogen and is associ-ated as the cause of respiratory tract disease in children and adults worldwide. The virus appears to be prevalent worldwide. The first report of virus in 2001 demonstrated that all Dutch children by the Chap-62.indd 522 5/14/2012 1:05:07 PMSection IV Chapter 62PARAMYXOVIRUSES 523 age of 10 years were seropositive for the virus. Similar studies conducted in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Israel have shown the high seroprevalence of HMPV antibodies in the population. Infants, elderly persons, and immunocompromised individuals appear to be more susceptible to infection by the virus. The virus is an important cause of respiratory tract infec- tion in children, particularly in infants. It causes a disease, clinical manifestations of which are very much similar to those caused by human RSV. It causes a clinical disease, which ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe cough, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. The condition is also associ-ated with high-grade fever, vomiting, and myalgia. The virus also causes RSV-like diseases in adults, especially in those with chronic obstructive lung disease. The virus is very difficult to grow in cell culture, and cur- rently, serodiagnosis tests are not widely available for diagnosis of the condition. PCR appears to be the most specific test for diagnosis of the condition by examination of respiratory secre-tions. These include nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. No specific antiviral treatment is available for HMPV infection. Hence, the treatment is majorly supportive. No vaccine is currently available for HMPV infection. Characteristics of various genera in the family Paramyxoviridae are summarized in Table genera in family Paramyxoviridae A 3-year-old girl attended the Pediatrics OPD with complaints of high fever, malaise, anorexia, conjunctivitis, cough, and coryza. Parents of the child gave the history of appearance of red-colored rash initially on the face and then spreading to the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. On examination, bluish gray specks on a red base were found on the buccal mucosa opposite the second molar. What is the clinical diagnosis of the condition? Are there any laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis of the condition? Is the child contagious, and how is the virus transmitted? What are the vaccines available to prevent the condition?CASE STUDY Chap-62.indd 523 5/14/2012 1:05:07 PM63 Introduction The family Reoviridae is divided into nine genera, of which only four genera cause human diseases. These genera are Orbivirus, Orthoreovirus, Rotavirus, and Coltivirus. Other genera infect only the plants, insects, and fish. The Reoviridae viruses are non-enveloped viruses with double-layered protein capsids. The inner capsid layer shows well-defined subunits, whereas the outer layer of some viruses (e.g., rotaviruses and orbiviruses) lacks these well-defined structures. The genome consists of a 10-12- segmented double-stranded RNA with a total genome size of 16-27 kbp. The virus core contains many enzymes essential for transcrip-tion and capping of viral RNA. These viruses are unusually resis-tant to heat, a wide pH (3.0-9.0), and to lipid solvents but are sensitive to 95% ethanol, phenol, and chlorine. Reoviruses asso-ciated with human diseases are listed in Table 63-1. Orbiviruses Orbiviruses are primarily animal pathogens that cause disease mainly in animals. They are so named for their ring-shaped (Latin word orbi: ring) structure. These viruses are differenti-ated from the orthoreoviruses by their protein structure and their transmission by arthropod vectors.

The orbi-viruses are nonenveloped viruses with two-layered capsids. The genome consists of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA. The virion measures 70-80 nm in diameter. Unlike other reoviruses, the orbiviruses are sensitive to low pH. The orbiviruses mainly cause disease in animals, such as sheep, cattle, goats, and wild ungulates. They are associated with African horse sickness in horses, donkeys, and dogs; blue tongue disease in sheep; and epizootic hemorrhagic feverin deer. Only few of orbiviruses are linked to disease in humans. Kemerovo virus has been implicated in neurological infections in Russia and Central Europe. Lebombo virus, a virus isolated in Africa, has been implicated with clinical disease in humans. Orbiviruses cause a severe flu-like disease, encephalitis, and polyradiculitis in humans. Fever, headache, and myalgia are the common manifestations. Rarely, the cases are complicated by other neurological manifestations. Till date, fewer than 50 cases of orbivirus infection in humans have been reported from Africa, South and Central America, Russia, and Eastern Europe. No case is reported from India. Humans acquire infec-tion by the bite of arthropod vectors including mosquitoes, ticks, gnats, and midges. Oklahoma tick fever or Kemerovo or Lipovnik virus infections are transmitted by bite of ticks, specifically Ixodes ticks. However, bite of mosquitoes transmits orbivirus infections in Africa and South America. Orbivirus infections are mostly asymptomatic. Changuinola virus has been implicated in a single documented case of an acute self-limited febrile illness in Panama. The disease is transmitted by Phlebotomus flies. Orungovirus found in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa causes an acute illness characterized by head-ache, fever, and myalgia. The virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Oklahoma tick fever, reported in Oklahoma and Texas in the United States, is transmitted by ticks. The condi-tion manifests as fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. The diagnostic facilities for orbivirus infections are available only in a few reference laboratories. Key Points The virus can be isolated by culture in Vero or baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells and by inoculation in suckling mice. Complement fixation test, neutralization test, and enzyme immunoassays are used for serodiagnosis of orbiviral infec-tions. A fourfold rise in antibody titer in acute and conva-lescent sera is suggestive of orbivirus infections. ELISA for detection of virus-specific IgM antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid is useful for diagnosis of patients with neu-rological complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis. Chap-63.indd 524 5/14/2012 1:04:35 PMSection IV Chapter 63REOVIRUSES 525 No specific antiviral agents are available. Use of insect repel- lants, protective clothing, and avoidance of tick bite prevent transmission of orbivirus infections. Coltiviruses Coltiviruses resemble the orbiviruses in their morphology and in having two capsids. The genome consists of a 12-segmented double-stranded RNA. The coltiviruses associated with human disease include Colorado tick fever, Salmon River virus, Banna virus, Beijing virus, Gansu virus, and Eyach virus. Colorado Tick Fever Virus Colorado tick fever is an acute viral infection transmitted by the bite of wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni ) caused by Colorado tick fever virus. Colorado fever was so named because the illness was believed to occur predominantly in Colorado and was used to distinguish this clinical illness from that of Rocky Mountain spotted fever caused by Rickettsia species. The causative agent of this fever was recognized as a virus in 1946. Colorado tick fever virus is a double-stranded RNA virus surrounded by two capsids. The virus contains 12 RNA seg-ments. The virus infects and replicates in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver of rhesus monkey, but without producing any histological abnormalities. The virus has been shown to replicate in erythroid precursor cells without severely damaging them and is present in mature red blood cells. Colorado tick fever occurs almost exclusively in the Western United States and in Canada. The disease is transmitted by the bite of wood tick, D. andersoni. Larval and nymphal stages of D. andersoni ticks usually transmit the virus among all rodents, but only adult ticks transmit the virus to humans. The ticks acquire the infection on feeding an infected viremic host. The infected ticks subsequently transmit the virus through their saliva during act of feeding on a new susceptible host. Squirrels, rabbits, and deer are the natural animal hosts for the virus. The virus generally causes a nonspecific febrile illness. The incubation period is short and varies from 3 to 6 days. The clinical manifestations of the acute condition are characterized by the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache with retro-orbital pain, malaise, nausea, and occasionally vomiting. A rash is generally absent by which Colorado tick fever is differentiated from the Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The fever is typically biphasic (i.e., with two episodes of fever), each of which lasts 2-3 days, separated by a remission of approxi-mately equal duration. In most cases, the febrile period is followed by moderate to marked weakness and malaise. Complications are rare, but may include hepatitis, pericarditis, epididymo-orchitis, atypical pneumonitis, encephalitis, and aseptic meningitis. Viruses are present in the erythrocytes during the first 2 weeks of disease. This is followed by a period during which the viruses infect and replicate within the erythropoietic cells. In the infected red blood cells, the viruses can live for the life of the cells, which is nearly 120 days. A single attack of infection usually produces lifelong immunity.Laboratory diagnosis of Colorado tick fever is established by isolation of the virus from the erythrocyte fraction of the whole blood. The virus has been shown to persist in erythrocytes for as long as 120 days. The virus has also been found in the cerebro-spinal fluid of patients with no apparent encephalitis or menin-gitis. The virus isolation, however, takes nearly 1-2 weeks. Neutralization test in suckling mice, tissue culture neutral- ization, immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay are various serological tests used for demonstration of antibodies in the serum for diagnosis of the condition. A fourfold increase in titer of the specimen during the acute phase and convales-cent phase is demonstrated in nearly all patients. Key Points Direct fluorescent antibody method is a rapid and the most useful method for demonstration of viral antigen directly on the surface of erythrocytes in a blood smear. A new RT-PCR has been used nowadays to detect viral genome in the red blood cells and to establish diagnosis of the condition as early as from the first day of the symptoms. No specific antiviral treatment is available for Colorado tick fever. The condition is usually self-limited and can be prevented by avoiding contact with the wood tick. Orthoreoviruses Orthoreoviruses are nonenveloped viruses, measuring 80 nm in diameter. It is composed of an inner protein shell, i.e., core and an outer protein shell known as outer capsid. The inner core is com-posed of three major lipids, /H9253 1, /H92532, and /H9268 2, and many minor pro- teins. The core consists of a 10-segmented double-stranded RNA. The reoviruses have three serotypes, namely, type 1, 2, and 3, based on neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition test. All these serotypes share a common complement fixation antigen. The reoviruses are very stable. They are stable to heat, to a wide range of pH, and are also stable in aerosols. Reoviruses can be cultured in monkey kidney cells, HeLa cells, and mouse L-cell fibroblast. Human volunteers' studies have failed to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between reoviruses and human ill-ness. So far, reoviruses have been linked with upper respiratory infection, fever, enteritis, and febrile exanthema in children. All three serotypes of the virus have been recovered from healthy children and from children with minor febrile illness, diarrhea, or enteritis. The exact method of transmission of reoviruses is not known. Since viruses are isolated most frequently from the feces, the infection appears to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Recent studies have shown the potential of reovirus as an oncolytic virus and have shown the susceptibility of trans-formed cell to reovirus replication. It has been demonstrated that normal nontransformed cells were resistant to the virus. Reovirus causes oncolysis (apoptotic cell death) in a wide variety of cancer cells and tumors. Results of many studies have shown a possible role of reovirus in the treatment of brain and leptomeningeal metastasis from Chap-63.indd 525 5/14/2012 1:04:36 PMSection IV Chapter 63526 VIROLOGY breast cancer. The beneficial role of reovirus in reducing the sequential spinal and leptomeningeal metastasis from medul-loblastoma has also been suggested. The laboratory diagnosis of the human orthoreovirus infection can be made by: The isolation of the virus and detection of the viral anti-gen and RNA genome in various clinical specimens, such as feces, throat swabs, and nasopharyngeal specimens. The serological tests, such as hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, or virus neutralization to demon-strate antibodies. These serological tests are used primarily for epidemiological studies. No specific treatment is available for orthoreovirus infection. No preventive measures have been suggested due to the lack of definitive association of orthoreovirus with human disease. Rotavirus Rotavirus is the most common agent of gastroenteritis in child-ren aged 6 months to 2 years. Properties of the Virus Morphology Rotavirus shows following features: The rotavirus has a distinctive morphological appearance by negative stain EM. The virus measures 70 nm in diam-eter and possesses three-layer icosahedral capsid without an envelope. The sharply defined circular outline of the outer capsid gives the appearance of the rim of a wheel placed on short pokes radiating from a wide arm. This appearance gives the virus the name \"rota\" (Latin word which means wheel). The genome consists of a segmented double-stranded RNA genome. The outer shell is composed of a major glycopro-tein with a molecular weight of 34,000 Da. This protein is known as viral protein (VP7). It also consists of a minor trypsin-sensitive protein with a molecular weight of 84,000 Da. This protein is now designated as VP4, which was earlier called VP3. The minor shell or core protein of the virus core consists of four proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP6. The NS35, Rotaviruses replicate in cytoplasm of the host cell. Infection of the cell begins by attachment to the cell surface at the site of beta-adrenergic receptor. After entry into the cell, the virion uncoats and in the cytoplasm the RNA-dependent RNA poly-merase mRNA from each of the 10-11 segments. These mRNAs encode a variety of structural and nonstructural proteins. RNA polymerase is one of those proteins that syn-thesizes minus strands, which become a part of progeny virus. Capsid proteins, subsequently, form an incomplete capsid around the minus strands. Later on, the plus strands of progeny genome segment are synthesized. Finally, the virions are released by lysis of the cell. Antigenic and genomic properties Human and animal rotaviruses have been classified into differ-ent serotypes, groups, and subgroups. Human rotaviruses have been classified to a total of 11 G serotypes primarily based on the VP7 (glycoprotein G) G2, G3, or G4 have been identified with a majority of infections and are designated as serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. There are six different HRP-P types. P type 1 is usually associated with G type 1, 3, or 4, whereas P type 1b is usually associated with a type 2. Rotaviruses are classified into seven groups (from A to G) based on the antigenicity of VP6 and the electrophoretic mobil-ity of the genomic segments. Human disease is caused mostly by group A and occasionally by group B and C rotaviruses. Other properties Rotaviruses are relatively stable at low temperature. They are also stable at extremes of pH (3.5-10) and also to repeated freezing and thawing. Treatment with proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, enhances the infectivity of the virus. Virus Isolation Culture Human rotaviruses are also difficult to grow. They do not grow readily in cell cultures. Rotavirus growth is facilitated if the viruses are pretreated with proteolytic enzyme, trypsin, and if low levels of trypsins are included in tissue culture medium. This causes cleavage of outer capsid protein of the virus and thereby facilitates uncoating. Pathogenesis and Immunity Rotavirus is transmitted by feco-oral transmission. Pathogenesis of rotavirus diarrhea Rotavirus survives the acidic environment in the stomach and initiates infection in the mucosal cells of the small intestine. It does not cause infection in mucosa of the stomach and large intestine. After absorption, the viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the enterocytes and damage their transport mechanism. Non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) of the rotavirus may act as a viral enterotoxin, which causes secretion of fluids by stimulating a signal transduction pathway. The toxin induces influx of calcium ion into enterocytes and release of neuro-nal activators, and alters sodium and glucose absorption. The resulting diarrhea is due to impaired sodium and Chap-63.indd 526 5/14/2012 1:04:36 PMSection IV Chapter 63REOVIRUSES 527 glucose absorption, as damaged cells on the villi are replaced by nonabsorbing immature crypt cells. The rotavirus after replicating in the cell causes damage to the cell. The damaged cells are released into the lumen of intes-tine, releasing large quantities of viruses in the diarrheic stool. It takes around 3-8 weeks for restoring the normal function of the cell. Hence, the rotavirus produces watery diarrhea similar to that seen in cholera. Host immunity Rotavirus infection is characterized by the presence of high quantity of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the intestinal secre-tions. The IgA plays an important role in conferring the gut immunity against rotavirus. It protects newborns up to the age of 6 months. The serum antibodies usually reduce the severity of the disease, but not necessarily prevent reinfec-tion. Even a small quantity of a virus may cause infection and diarrhea in the absence of specific antibodies in the serum. Clinical Syndrome Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea in infants and young children. Diarrhea The incubation period is short being less than 48 hours. The condition manifests commonly as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally dehydration. Vomiting is usually of short duration and can occur before or after the onset of diarrhea. The diarrheic stool may be watery, green, or yellow but does not contain mucus. Rotavirus diarrhea is a self-limiting disease, and patients recover completely within 5-10 days without any complications on sequelae. Also, rotavirus has been reported as an agent of traveler's diarrhea in adults. The virus has also been reported to cause gastroenteritis in adults. Epidemiology Rotavirus is found worldwide. The virus is an important cause of diarrhea in infants and young children between 3 and 5 years of age. The viruses are excreted in the diarrheic stool of the chil-dren 2-5 days after the start of diarrhea. The infected children are the common source and reservoir of infection. The virus is transmitted from person-to-person by fecal-oral route. The virus is resistant to environmental condition, hence sur-vives well on fomites, as well as on hands. The rotavirus diar-rheal disease shows a seasonal variation; the disease being more common in autumn, spring, and winter. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimen Diarrheic stool is the specimen of choice for demonstration of rotavirus and viral antigens. Microscopy Rotavirus can be demonstrated in stool by direct electron microscopy (EM) and by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). Key Points Direct EM is a rapid method for detecting rotavirus in the fecal specimen. EM detects typical 70-nm cart-wheel-shaped viruses in the stool. The sensitivity of this method, however, is low. On-grid IEM is a three times more sensitive and reliable method than the conventional EM for demonstration of rotaviruses in the stool. Direct antigen detection Enzyme immunoassay, such as Rotazyme and latex agglutina-tion test, are useful tools to detect rotavirus antigen directly in the stool for diagnosis of diarrheal illness. This is a method used for routine diagnosis of rotavirus diarrhea. Isolation of the virus Rotaviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture, hence are not routinely used for diagnosis of rotavirus diarrhea. Treatment No specific antiviral therapy is available for rotavirus infec-tion. The treatment of the condition is mostly supportive. It consists of restoring the fluid loss in dehydrated patients. Oral rehydration fluid using glucose and electrolyte solution is currently preferred than the intravenous fluids to restore the hydration. Intravenous fluids are used only in severely dehydrated children. Prevention and Control Few vaccines have been evaluated to protect children from rotavirus diarrhea. Improved personal hygiene including hand washing and isolation of known cases of rotavirus are the best modes of control of the rotavirus diarrhea. Vaccines A rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus tetravalent vaccine (RRV-TV; Rota shield) is a recent vaccine being used since 1998. The vaccine consists of a polyvalent preparation consist-ing of the VP7 protein of each of the four clinically important serotypes with the attenuation phenotype of the rhesus rota-virus. This has been successful in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea in two different studies conducted in Finland with protection rates of 80-91%. In developing countries, such as Peru and Brazil, the efficacy of this vaccine has been less impressive, varying between 20% and 30% protection rates in children.

It causes rabies, a rec-ognized zoonotic disease worldwide. Rabies is the most fatal infection in humans. No specific antirabies agents are useful, once clinical signs or symptoms develop. Classification The family Rhabdoviridae is classified into two genera: Lyssavirus and Vesiculovirus . The genus Lyssavirus consists of more than 80 viruses and includes a rabies serogroup, which consists of 10 viruses including the classic rabies virus. The rabies virus is the prototypical human Lyssavirus pathogen. Other viruses included in this group are Mokola virus, Duvenhage virus, Obodhiang virus, Kotonkan virus, Rochambeau virus, European bat Lyssavirus types 1 and 2, and Australian bat Lyssavirus. These viruses rarely cause human disease. The genus Vesiculovirus includes vesicular stomatitis virus and other viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates. Rabies Virus Rabies virus causes rabies, a viral infection of the central and peripheral nervous systems that causes encephalitis with or without paralysis. It is mostly fatal. Properties of the Virus Morphology Rabies virus shows following features: It is a bullet-shaped virus with one end rounded or conical and the other end planar or concave (Fig. 64-1). It is a negative-sense, nonsegmented, single-stranded RNA virus measuring approximately 60 /H11003 180 nm. It is composed of an internal protein core or nucleocapsid, which contains the nucleic acid. It also consists of an outer envelope, a lipid-containing bilayer covered with trans-membrane glycoprotein spikes. The nucleocapsid shows helical symmetry, containing a linear negative-sense RNA with an RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase. The rabies virus. The genome encodes for production of five proteins associ-ated with either the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or the viral envelope. The L (transcriptase), N (nucleoprotein), and NS (transcriptase-associated) proteins comprise the RNP complex, together with the viral RNA. These proteins are aggregated together in the cytoplasm of virus-infected neurons and consti-tute Negri bodies, the characteristic histopathological finding of rabies virus infection. The M (matrix) and G (glycoprotein) proteins are associated with the lipid envelope. The G protein forms the protrusions that cover the outer surface of the virion envelope and is the only rabies virus protein known to induce virus-neutralizing antibody. Viral replication Rabies virus replicates in the cytoplasm. It causes infection by combining with the acetylcholine receptor of the cell surface. The virus then enters the cell, uncoats, and the viral RNA polymerase synthesizes five mRNAs that encode viral proteins. The virus-encoded RNA polymerase facilitates the replication of the viral genomic RNA, which is followed by assembly of the genomic RNA with virion proteins to form the nucleocapsid. Finally, the virions bud from plasma membrane by budding through the cell membrane, during which they acquire their envelopes. Chap-64.indd 529 5/14/2012 1:03:39 PMSection IV Chapter 64530 VIROLOGY Antigenic and genomic properties Rabies viruses of humans and animals are of single antigenic type. Rabies virus contains the following antigens:G protein: The glycoprotein or G protein is present on the surface spikes present on the outer lipoprotein envelope of the virion. It mediates the attachment of virus to the acetylcho-line receptors of neural tissues. The G protein is important in pathogenesis and virulence of the virus. It is strongly antigenic and elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies, which are protective. It also induces hemagglutination-inhibiting anti-bodies and stimulates cell-mediated immunity. G protein is a antigen.N protein: Nucleoprotein or N protein is a group-specific antigen. It shows cross-reaction with some rabies-related viruses. It is antigenic and produces antibodies, which are not protective but are of diagnostic value. These antibodies can be demon-strated by serological tests, such as immunofluorescence (IF) test for the purpose of diagnosis.Other antigens: These include membrane proteins, glyco-lipid, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Typing of strains Rabies viruses may be typed as fixed or street viruses. The fixed viruses are the viruses that by several intracerebral passages in animals or cell culture undergo certain changes, such as they show a fixed incubation period of 6-7 days. The street viruses are those viruses that are isolated from natural human and animal infections and show a variable incubation period of 1-12 weeks. The monoclonal antibodies and genetic sequencing are now being used to differentiate and type street rabies viruses. Typing of street viruses has been found to be helpful in identifying viral variants originating in major host reservoirs throughout the world. This is also found to be useful to suggest the likely sources of human exposure when a history of definitive animal bite was otherwise missing from a patient's case history. Differences between fixed and street viruses are summarized in Table 64-1. Other properties Rabies virus possesses hemagglutinating property. The virus agglutinates goose erythrocytes at 0-4\u00b0C and at pH 6.2. Rabies virus is sensitive to ethanol, iodine, soap, quaternary ammo-nium compounds, detergents, ether, chloroform, acetone, etc. It is inactivated by formalin, phenol, beta-propiolactone, ultraviolet radiation, and sunlight. It can be inactivated at 50\u00b0C Street virus Fixed virus Virus is isolated from natural human or animal infection Virus is isolated after several serial intracerebral passages in rabbits Can cause fatal encephalitis in laboratory animals after a long incubation period of 1-12 weeksNeurotropic but much less infective. Can cause fatal encephalitis in laboratory animals after a short and fixed incubation period of 6-7 days Negri bodies can be demonstrated in the brain of infected animals Negri bodies cannot be demonstrated in the brain of infected animalsCannot be used for vaccine production Can be used for vaccine productionTABLE 64-1 Differences between street and fixed rabies virusesfor 1 hour or at 60\u00b0C for 5 minutes. It can also be inactivated on exposure to CO 2. The virus is resistant to drying and cold. It survives at 4\u00b0C for weeks; hence viruses can be preserved by storing at /H1100270\u00b0C or by lyophilization. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Embryonated egg The rabies virus grows in the yolk sac of the chick embryo. The rabies vaccine strains, such as Flury and Kelev strains, are grown in the yolk sac. Cell culture Rabies virus can grow in several primary and continuous cell cul-tures. These are WI-38, BHK (baby hamster kidney)-21, and chick (CER) chick embryo fibroblast, and porcine, mouse, or hamster kidney cell lines. The fixed virus strains are adapted to grow in vero and human diploid cell lines. The cyto-pathic effect produced by the virus in the cell lines is minimal. Laboratory animals Mouse is the animal of choice. Intracerebral route is the fre-quently used route of infection. Intracerebral inoculation causes encephalitis, and the inoculated mouse die within 5-30 days. Pathogenesis and Immunity Rabies virus has a broad host range. The virus can infect all mammals, although certain mammals (such as dogs, foxes, wolves, and bats) are important for transmission of infection. Pathogenesis of rabies The virus may enter the peripheral nervous system directly at the site of bite. In some cases, however, it may replicate in muscle tissue after entering the host, remaining at or near the site of introduction for most of the incubation period. However, the precise sites of viral sequestration remain unknown, since neither the antigen nor the virus can usually be found in any organ during this phase. The virus infects the sensory neurons and moves rapidly by axonal transport centripetally to the central nervous system (CNS) for replication. During its transport within the neurons, it is protected from the host immune system. The virus travels along the axons at a rate of 12-24 mm in a day to enter the Chap-64.indd 530 5/14/2012 1:03:40 PMSection IV Chapter 64RHABDOVIRUSES 531 spinal ganglion. Its multiplication in the ganglion is indicated by the onset of pain or paresthesia at the site of the inoculum, which are the first clinical symptom and a hallmark finding. From here, the virus spreads quickly, at a rate of 200-400 mm/day, into the CNS, and the spread is marked by rapidly progressive encephalitis. Thereafter, the virus spreads to the periphery and salivary glands (Fig. 64-2). During the course of infection, encephalitis develops, associ- ated with the death of neurons and demyelination. Acidophilic intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusion bodies are found in infected neurons, which is important for laboratory diagnosis. Host immunity Production of cytokines (such as interferon), induced during rabies virus infection or vaccination, has been reported to abort the disease if it occurs shortly after viral infection. Recently, it has been demonstrated that animals immunized with puri-fied RNP complexes or recombinant nucleoprotein vaccines resisted lethal challenge with rabies virus. However, the role of N protein in protection, illness, or recovery is unclear. Clinical Syndrome Rabies virus causes rabies, the most fatal infection in humans. No specific antirabies agents are useful, once clinical signs or symptoms develop. Rabies In general, four stages of rabies are recognized in humans. These are (i) incubation, (ii) prodromal period, (iii) acute neuro-logic period, and (iv) coma; which subsequently lead to death.Incubation period: The average period of incubation is 20-90 days. Rarely, incubation lasts as long as 19 years. In more than 90% of cases, incubation is less than 1 year. During the incubation period, the virus travels from peripheral areas to the CNS. The patients remain asymptomatic during the period. The incubation period is less than 50 days if the patient is bitten on the head or neck or if a heavy inoculum is trans-ferred through multiple bites, deep wounds, or large wounds. A person with a scratch on the hand may take longer to develop symptoms of rabies than a person who receives a bite on the head. The rabies virus is protected from the immune system during this period and no antibody response is observed.Prodromal period: The virus enters the CNS during the pro- dromal period. The duration of this period is 2-10 days. The period is characterized by nonspecific symptoms and sign Paresthesia or pain develops at the inoculation site and is pathognomonic for rabies. Paresthesia occurs in 50% of cases during this phase and may be the patient's only presenting sign. Other symptoms may include malaise, anorexia, head-ache, fever, chills, pharyngitis, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and depression.Acute neurologic period: This period is associated with objec-tive signs of developing CNS disease. The duration is 2-7 days. Furthermore, it presents with the following conditions:Furious rabies: Patients develop agitation, hyperactivity, restless- ness, thrashing, biting, confusion, or hallucinations. After several hours to days, this becomes episodic and interspersed with calm, cooperative, lucid periods. Furious episodes last for less than 5 minutes. Episodes may be triggered by visual, auditory, or tac-tile stimuli, or they may be spontaneous. Seizures may occur. 1 23 45678 Replication in dorsal ganglion Virus inoculated by dog biteSkinSalivary glandsEyeDescending infection via nervous system to eye, salivary glands, skin, and other organsInfection of spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and other brain structures Rapid ascent in spinal cord Virion enters peripheral nervous system Viral replication in musclesPassive ascent via sensory fibers FIG. 64-2. Pathogenesis of rabies humans. Chap-64.indd 531 Hydrophobia and aerophobia are pathognomonic for rabies and occur in 50% of patients. Attempting to drink or having air blown in the face produces severe laryngeal or diaphragmatic spasms and a sensation of choking. This may be related to a violent response of the airway irri-tant mechanisms. Even the suggestion of drinking may induce hydrophobic spasm. Autonomic instability is observed, including nerve involvement with diplopia, facial palsy, and optic neuritis. This phase may either end in cardiorespiratory arrest or progress to paralysis.Paralytic rabies: It is also known as dumb rabies or apathetic rabies, because the patient is relatively quiet compared to a per-son with the furious form. Paralysis develops from the outset. Fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity are prominent. Paralysis is symmetric and may be either generalized or ascending and may be mistaken for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Calmness and clar-ity gradually deteriorates to delirium, stupor, and then coma.Coma: The patient may go into coma within 10 days of onset; but duration is variable. Coma leads to respiratory failure within a week of neurologic symptoms. Hypoventilation and metabolic acidosis predominate. Acute respiratory distress syn-drome is common. Without intensive supportive care, respi-ratory depression, arrest, and death occur shortly after coma. Most cases result in death within 14 days because of compli-cations, despite intensive supportive care. Recovery is very unlikely. A few reports indicate that those patients who sur-vived had pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis supported by most advanced life-support system. Epidemiology Rabies is a recognized zoonotic disease worldwide. Geographical distribution Rabies has been recognized for over 4000 years. Today it is found in most countries, except many Australian islands, Great Britain, Japan, Hawaii, and most of the Caribbean islands. The risk of rabies is highest in countries with hyperendemic canine rabies, including most of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Rabies is endemic in India. It has been estimated that more than 30,000 people die of rabies in India every year. More than 70,000 people in India receive antirabies vaccination per year. With the dog population of over 16 million, the problem of rabies is huge. The virus is usually transmitted from a rabid animal to humans mostly by bites or other forms of traumatic contacts. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Rabies is a zoonotic disease. Dogs are the important reservoir of infection. Other animal reservoirs include silver-haired bats, eastern pipistrella, raccoons, skunks, foxes, or cats, ferrets, cattle, opossums, fowl, etc. Foxes are more infectious than dogs and other animals, because larger amounts of virus (up to 10 6 infectious doses/mL) are present in their saliva. The virus is excreted in saliva of infected dogs, foxes, wolves, jackals, vampire bats, raccoons, and skunks. The virus is found in the salivary gland of these infected animals. Infected saliva or infected CNS tissue, including corneal transplants in humans, are the sources of infection. The virus is transmitted to humans by following ways: Bite of a rabid dog or other infected animals is the main route of transmission of infection. Contact of saliva with broken skin or with mucous mem-branes, exposure to aerosolized secretions from an infected animal, and contact with unpasteurized milk from dairies are very uncommon modes of transmission. Corneal transplants: The only documented cases of rabies caused by human-to-human transmission occurred in eight recipients of transplanted corneas. Currently, donated cor-neas are not accepted if the donor died from encephalitis that may be consistent with rabies. In India, few such cases have also been documented. With the exception of corneal transplants, man-to-man infec-tion is rare. Laboratory Diagnosis in Humans Specimens Saliva, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, urine, and skin and brain biopsy are the frequently used specimens for diagnosis of rabies. Microscopy Demonstration of Negri bodies by microscopy is the character-istic histopathological feature of rabies (Fig. 64-3, Color Photo 59). Impression smears of the human brain tissue collected at postmortem are stained by Seller's technique for demonstra-tion of Negri bodies. The stain contains methylene blue alcohol as fixative and basic fuchsin as staining reagent. Key Points Negri bodies are demonstrated in 80% of human cases of rabies. Therefore, failure to demonstrate Negri bodies in neural tissue does not rule out the diagnosis of rabies. Negri bodies are made up of a finely fibrillar matrix and rabies virus particles. They appear as intracytoplasmic, round or oval, purplish pink structures with characteristic basophilic inner gran-ules on staining by Seller's technique. They measure 3-27 /H9262m in size. They are found in the neural tissues and are found more in the cerebellum and hippocampus. They are not found in non-neural tissues, such as corneal specimen, saliva, or skin. Chap-64.indd 532 5/14/2012 1:03:41 PMSection Negri neural tissue (/H110031000). Direct Antigen Detection Viral antigens can be demonstrated in the corneal smear, skin biopsy collected from the face or neck, and saliva (antemortem) or in the brain tissue (postmortem) for diagnosis of rabies. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test using specific mono-clonal antibodies is a specific method to demonstrate rabies antigen in clinical specimens. Isolation of the virus Viruses can be isolated from brain tissue, CSF, saliva, and urine by culture in cell lines or in animals.Culture: Isolation of virus in cell lines (WI-38, BHK-21, and CER) is a sensitive method. The cytopathic effect produced by the virus is minimal; hence, the presence of virus in the inoculated cell cultures is made by demonstration of viral anti-gen within 2-4 days. The DFA test using monoclonal rabies antibodies tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate is a fre-quently used specific method to demonstrate the antigen.Animal inoculation: Mouse is the animal of choice. CSF, saliva, and urine are inoculated intracerebrally. The inoculated mice are observed for the signs of clinical illness. After death of the mice or after 28 days of inoculation, the brain tissues are examined for the presence of Negri bodies by microscopy or for viral antigen by the DFA test. Serodiagnosis Rabies antibodies are found in the serum as well as in the CSF of human cases. A high titer of antibodies is found in the CSF. Antibodies in the serum are demonstrated by a rapid fluores-cent focus inhibition test titer in which results are positive in 50% of cases. In the CSF, positive antibody titers (2-25% of serum titer) are found after the first week of illness. Molecular Diagnosis Polymerase chain reaction is being increasingly evaluated for the diagnosis of rabies. The nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) on saliva and CSF can be used for rapid diagnosis as early as 2 days after symptom onset. The NASBA technique on urine samples may be used in the future. Other tests WBC count ranges from normal to elevated, with 6-8% atypical monocytes. Albuminuria and sterile pyuria may be observed. Respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation develops in the prodromal and early acute neurologic phases, which is followed by respiratory acidosis as respiratory depression progresses. In the CSF, after the first week of illness, 80% monocytosis is observed. Protein and glucose test results are normal. Antemortem diagnosis of human rabies Until recently, most of the cases of rabies were fatal and patients used to die of the rabies. But with intensive support care and better management of patients, few cases have survived. Hence in such situations, laboratory methods for antemortem diag-nosis of rabies in humans are proving to be more useful. Key Points Corneal smears, skin biopsy from nape of the neck or face, and saliva are the usual specimens. Diagnosis is made by demonstration of rabies virus antigen by IF or the viral DNA by molecular methods. Nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) on saliva and CSF can be used for rapid diagnosis as early as 2 days after symptom onset. Laboratory Diagnosis in Animals Laboratory diagnosis of rabies in dogs and other animals is useful to assess the risk of infection and to monitor postexpo-sure prophylaxis in humans bitten by the animals. Specimens The brain of the dead animal is the specimen of choice. The brain is collected carefully from the dead animal. Part of the specimen is collected in 50% glycerol saline (preservative) for isolation of virus. The other part of the brain including the hip-pocampus and cerebellum (abundant in Negri bodies) is col-lected in fixative for demonstration of Negri bodies. Microscopy Impression smears of the brain tissue are stained by Seller's technique for demonstration of Negri bodies. This is still a useful method in the laboratories lacking facilities for cell cul-ture and antigen detection methods. Direct antigen detection Demonstration of viral antigens in the infected brain tissue and in saliva of the animal by DFA is a useful method for diagnosis of rabies in animals. Detection of antigen in the saliva shows whether the animal was excreting the virus in the saliva or not. Isolation of the virus Viruses can be isolated from animal brain issue and saliva by culture in cell lines or in animals, as described earlier for diag-nosis of human rabies. Chap-64.indd 533 5/14/2012 1:03:41 64534 VIROLOGY Treatment No specific antirabies agent is available. Although until recently rabies was considered to be invariably fatal, it has now been demonstrated that complete recovery can occur from estab-lished rabies with intensive supportive care and management of complications. Prevention and Control Specific prophylaxis in rabies, depending upon whether given before or after exposure can be discussed as pre-exposure pro-phylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis. Pre-exposure prophylaxis Pre-exposure prophylaxis is given to persons at high risk, such as dog handlers, other animal handlers, and veterinarians. This is achieved by use of cell culture vaccines, which are more safe. Pre-exposure prophylaxis requires three doses of cell culture vaccines, given on day 0, 7, 21, or on day 0, 28, and 56. A booster dose is recommended after 1 year, and then one dose every year. Animal control and vaccination strategies now have stronger roles than postexposure prophylaxis in preventing the spread of rabies. Postexposure prophylaxis Postexposure prophylaxis is started immediately after exposure to infection. After exposure to possibly infected dog or other rabid animals, immediate preventive actions are taken up, which consist of (a) local treatment, (b) confirmation whether or not the animal is rabid, (c) administration of hyperimmune serum, and (d) antirabies vaccine.Local treatment: This involves prompt cleaning of the wound. Animal bites deposit the virus in the wounds. The wound should be immediately scrubbed with soap and water followed by treatment with quaternary ammonium compounds, such as Cetavlon, tincture, or aqueous solution of iodine or alcohol.Confirmation whether or not the animal is rabid: This can be made by clinical observation of suspected dog. If dog is still healthy 10 days after biting human, rabies is extremely unlikely. Diagnosis can also be made by demonstration of the Negri bodies in brain tissues at autopsy or viral antigens in the brain tissue or saliva.Administration of hyperimmune serum: Passive immuni- zation is carried out by administering purified equine rabies immune globulin (ERIG) and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG). Administration of HRIG is promptly made to ensure passive immunization against rabies. The recommended dose of HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight. Fifty percent of the dose is given into the wound and 50% intramuscularly. It is usually given before or simultaneously with the first dose of the rabies vaccine. It is not given after injection of rabies vaccine. The recommenda-tions for postexposure prophylaxis are presented in Table 64-2.Antirabies vaccine: Rabies is the only disease where postexpo- sure vaccination is employed extensively and successfully. This is due to long incubation period of the disease. The chances of preventing the rabies are more when vaccination is given to humans as early as possible after exposure. Since the time of Pasteur's successful use of a rabies vaccine obtained from des-iccated preparation of spinal cord of rabbits in the year 1885, a wide variety of vaccines are being used worldwide to protect humans against rabies even after infection with the virus. Of late, neural-tissue vaccines are gradually being replaced by cell culture vaccines that are grown in human diploid cells and then inactivated with propiolactone (refer the box Vaccines). The list of such vaccines with their advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table 64-3. Vaccines Cell culture vaccines: These vaccines include human diploid cell vaccine, purified chick embryo cell vaccine, and purified vero cell vaccines. All these cell culture vaccines are equally effective and safe. The dosage schedule is same for children and adults. These are given intramuscularly or subcutaneously in the deltoid region in adults and on the anterolateral side of the thigh in children. Postexposure prophylaxis requires a course of five to six doses, starting as soon as possible. These are given, on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 30, and optionally, 90. The first dose on the day 0 is combined with an injection of human hyperimmunoglobulin (20 IU/kg). Vaccination with complete dosages gives virtually complete protection, for at least 5 years. During this period of 5 years, if any further exposure occurs, only one or two booster doses (on days 0, 3) may be given. After 5 years, a full course of five injections is given if the patient is again exposed to infection. Rabies-Related Viruses The genus Lyssavirus consists of more than 80 viruses includ-ing the rabies virus, which is the prototypical human Lyssavirus pathogen. Other viruses included in this group rarely cause human disease.Category I Touching, feeding of animals or licks on intact skin No exposure Therefore, no treatment if history reliable Category II Minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding or licks on broken skin Nibbling of uncovered skin Use vaccine alone Category III Single or multiple transdermal bites, scratches or contamination of mucous membrane with saliva (i.e., licks) Use immunoglobulin plus vaccine Use vaccine alone *According to the World Health Organization Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Virus The virus is classified as Lyssavirus serotype 4. The virus has been reported in bats from Southern Africa and many European countries. The first human case was reported in 1971 from South Africa, who died of clinical rabies after being bitten by a bat. Mokola Virus The virus is classified as Lyssavirus serotype 3. The virus has been isolated from many domestic and wild animals (shrew, cat, and dog) in Africa. It was first reported from shrews in Africa in the year 1968. Later, the virus has been isolated from animals in many European countries. The first report of human infection was from two children with CNS infection.Lagos Bat Virus The virus is classified as Lyssavirus serotype 2. The viruses have been reported from bats and cats in Nigeria and Central Africa. The virus was initially isolated in 1956 from the pooled brains of frugivorous bats from Lagos island, Nigeria. The virus causes a rabies-like illness following intracerebral inoculation in infected monkeys. Other Rabies-Related Viruses Other viruses, such as Rochambeau virus and Australian bat Lyssavirus have been reported to cause occasional rabies-like fatal disease in humans. Obodhiang and Kotonkan viruses have only been reported from mosquitoes in Sudan and Ibadan. No human infection by these viruses has been documented.Type of vaccine Advantages Disadvantages Neural vaccines (Semple vaccines, beta-propiolactone vaccine, and infant brain vaccine) Cheap and economical Poor immunogens Encephalitogenic Associated with serious risk of neurologic complications Non-neural vaccines: Egg vaccines (duck egg vaccine, live attenuated chick embryo vaccine: Flury strain\u2014LEP vaccine, HEP vaccine) Cheap immunogenic vaccines (HDC vaccine from WI-38, MRC-5) Highly antigenic Free from side effects Very expensive Primary cell culture vaccines grown on chick embryo, hamster and dog kidney cells and continuous cell culture vaccines grown on vero cells Highly immunogenic Economical No particular disadvantage Subunit vaccines: Surface glycoprotein cloned and recombinant vaccine Very protective Safe Still in experimental stagesTABLE 64-3 Different rabies vaccines: advantages and disadvantages A 35-year-old hunter from rural India came with sore throat and had trouble in swallowing. The man was treated as usual with antibiotics by a local physician. That night, the man began to pace and spit frequently, his facial muscles twitched uncontrollably, and he became anxious and fearful. He was hospitalized. Physicians thought he might be suffering from a drug overdose or viral encephalitis. Although he remained alert for several days, he became increasingly agitated, he vom-ited, his body temperature rose to 106\u00b0F, and he died. His friend on enquiry revealed that the victim had a tussle with a dog while he was hunting 2 months ago. What is the possible cause for his death? What are the reservoirs for the organism? What are the presenting symptoms in case of this suspected infection? How can you confirm this condition in laboratory?CASE STUDY Chap-64.indd 535 5/14/2012 1:03:41 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 65 Introduction Arboviruses are RNA viruses that are transmitted by arthro-pods. The word arbovirus is an acronym for arthropod-borne viruses that are transmitted by arthropods, from one verte-brate host to another. Arbovirus is a collective name for a large group of viruses of which about 100 are known human patho-gens. Most of the arboviruses causing infections in humans are zoonotic, with humans acting as accidental host. Humans play an important role in the maintenance or transmission of the virus in the cycle. Yellow fever virus and dengue virus are two exceptions, which are not zoonotic. The viruses multiply in tissues of the arthropod host without producing any disease. Some arboviruses are maintained in nature by transovarian transmission in arthropods. Dengue, Japanese encephalitis Eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile fever, and sandfly fever are some of the major arbovirus diseases distributed worldwide. In India, the most important arbovirus infections are JE, chikungunya fever, dengue, Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Chandipura fever, and encephalitis. Classification Arboviruses were named initially, according to the disease they cause, such as yellow fever virus, or depending upon the place from where they were first isolated, e.g., West Nile fever and St. Louis encephalitis. Taxonomically, most arboviruses and roboviruses are recently classified families, namely, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. Most viruses of medical importance are included in the family Togaviridae, some belong to family Flaviviridae, and some to reoviruses, and rhab- with human infections are summarized in Table 65-1. Important Properties of Arboviruses The Viruses Togaviruses Togaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. They are spheri-cal, 17 nm in diameter, and have an Human with human infections surrounded by an envelope. They replicate in cytoplasm of the infected host cell, and after assembly in the host cell they show budding through the cell membrane. All viruses are serologi-cally related. Togaviruses are divided into two families: alpha-viruses and rubiviruses. The major togaviruses are chikungunya, viruses, Mayaro, O/H11032nyong-nyong, Semliki Forest, and Sindbis viruses. Most of these viruses are transmitted by mosquito arthropods to humans. Flaviviruses Flaviviruses are similar to togaviruses in that they are also single-stranded RNA viruses and have an icosahedral nucleo-capsid surrounded by an envelope. They differ from togavi-ruses in being small, only 40-50 nm in diameter; in contrast, the togaviruses are relatively large and have a diameter of 70 nm. The flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and assembly of viruses occurs within endoplasmic reticulum. All (80-120 in diameter), and have a triple-segmented and a single-stranded RNA. They have a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope. They replicate in the cytoplasm, and the assembly of the Chap-65.indd 536 5/14/2012 1:02:55 PMSection IV Chapter 65ARBOVIRUSES 537 virion occurs by budding on smooth membrane of the Golgi system. The members of the family Bunyaviridae are are nonenveloped viruses. The genome consists of a double-stranded RNA of 10-12 segments. Replication and assembly of the virus occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Reoviruses are divided into two genera: Coltivirus and Orbivirus. Coltiviruses include Colorado tick fever virus, transmitted by ticks. Orbiviruses include African horse sickness virus and blue tongue virus. Rhabdoviruses Rhabdoviruses include the vesiculoviruses, which are transmit-ted by either mosquitoes or sandflies. Vesicular stomatitis virus and Chandipura viruses are the common examples. Life Cycle The life cycle of the arboviruses is characterized by their abil-ity to multiply in both the vertebrate hosts and blood-sucking arthropods. Nevertheless, for effective transmission to vectors, the virus must be present in sufficiently higher number in the blood stream of the vertebrate hosts, which can be taken up in small volume of blood ingested during bite of the arthropod. After ingestion, the virus replicates in the gut of arthropods and then spreads to other organs including the salivary gland. Only the females of the species serve as the vector of the virus, because female species require blood meal for production of the progeny. Most of these viruses in their life cycle show an extrinsic incubation period in the vectors, during which viruses are replicated sufficiently in the vector and are present in suf-ficient numbers in the saliva to transmit infection to the verte-brate host. The extrinsic period for most of the viruses ranges from 7 to 14 days. Some arboviruses are transmitted by vertical transmission through transovarial passage from a mother tick to baby ticks. Key Points Humans in transmission cycle of arboviruses are usually the dead-end hosts. Usually human-to-human transmission of infection by the arthropods does not take place due to very low titer of viruses present in the human blood. In some diseases, such as dengue and yellow fever, there is a very high titer of viruses in the blood; hence they act as reservoir of infection of other humans. Disease caused by arboviruses occurs primarily in dead-end host, but neither in the arthropod vector nor in the vertebrate animal that act as the natural host. For example, after infec-tion yellow fever virus causes disease in humans, who are a dead-end host, but causes a harmless infection among the jun-gle monkeys in South Africa, which serve as the natural host for yellow fever virus. Clinical Syndromes Arboviruses cause diseases in humans, which may be one of the following clinical syndromes: 1. Fever with or without maculopapular rash. 2. Encephalitis, often with high mortality. 3. Hemorrhagic fever, also frequently severe and fatal. How ever, there are some arboviruses that can cause more than one syndrome in the infected human host, e.g., dengue virus. Recovery from the disease usually confers a lifelong immunity. Epidemiology Arbovirus infection occurs in distinct geographical distribu-tion and vector patterns. The viruses occur in tropics as well as in temperate countries. They show a tendency to cause sudden outbreak of disease that usually occurs in the adjoining areas between human dwellings in jungle or forest areas. Control Control methods essentially include vector controls and vac-cination. The vaccination has been effective only in yellow fever and a few other diseases but not in most of arboviral diseases. Hence, vector control continues to be a mainstay in prevention of arboviral diseases. Roboviruses A new group of viruses called roboviruses has been described recently. This is an acronym for rodent-borne viral disease, which is transmitted from rodents to rodents and directly from rodents to humans without participation of arthropod vec-tors. Transmission occurs by direct contact with body fluids or excreta of rodents. Hantavirus infection, Lassa fever, and South American hemorrhagic fever are the major rodent-borne viral diseases worldwide. The properties of roboviruses are summa-rized in Box 65-1. Togaviruses Togaviruses are the largest family of arboviruses and contains two genera: Alphavirus and Rubivirus. The genus Alphavirus includes 32 different viruses of which at least 13 viruses are associated with human diseases. They are transmitted mainly by mosquitoes. The genus Rubivirus contains rubella virus that causes rubella, which is not classified Chapter (a) Western encephalitis Venezuelan equine Febrile illness group (a) Chikungunya virus (b) O'nyong-nyong virus (c) Semliki forest virus (d) Sindbis virus (e) Ross river virus 2. Rubivirus A. Rubella virus Alphaviruses Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne arboviruses, which can be classified as febrile illness group and encephalitis group. The febrile group includes chikungunya virus, O'nyong-nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus, and Ross River virus. The encephalitis group includes Western equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Encephalitis group Encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain parenchyma often with secondary meningeal involvement. Western equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan are associated with encephalitis.Western equine encephalitis virus: This virus causes disease more frequently than the eastern equine encephalitis virus, but the infection is less severe. It is a neuropathic Alphavirus, which causes encephalitis and viral symptoms with an associated rash. The virus is spread primarily by the vector mosquito Culex tarsalis. The condition is most commonly seen in the United States and is subclinical. The isolation of the virus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or demonstration of rise in specific antibody titer in the serum confirms the diagnosis. No antivi-ral therapy is available. A killed vaccine is available to protect horses but not humans.Eastern equine encephalitis virus: Eastern equine encepha- litis virus is of the alphaviruses that causes most severe 1.

Broad host range. 7. Neurotropic. 8. Cause neurobehavioral abnormalities.Box 65-1 Important properties of Robovirusesdisease and is associated with highest fatality. The virus is transmitted primarily by Culiseta mosquito. Wild boars are the reservoir host, and horses and humans are the dead-end hosts. The diagnosis is made by isolating the virus or demonstrating a rise in antibody titer in the serum. There is no antiviral therapy. There is a killed virus vaccine for horses, but not for humans.Venezuelan equine encephalitis: This virus is transmitted primarily by Culex and Culiseta mosquitoes. The condition that manifests as a mild systemic infection and may lead to enceph-alitis is prevalent in North and South America. Birds are the reservoir hosts. Febrile illness group Chikungunya virus: Chikungunya virus was first described in humans and Aedes aegypti mosquito from Tanzania in 1954. The name chikungunya means \"doubled up\", which describes the clinical manifestation in which patient lies doubled up due to severe joint pains. The disease is transmitted primarily by A. aegypti mosquitoes. Humans are dead-end hosts and no ani-mal reservoirs are seen. The virus causes a severe disease with a sudden onset of fever, frequent joint pains, lymphadenopathy, and conjunctivitis. Fever typically is biphasic with a period of revision after 1-6 days. The condition is often associated with maculopapular rash. Hemorrhagic lesions were also observed in the patients in Kolkata during 1963. Chikungunya virus was first demonstrated in India in 1963 during extensive epidemic caused by the virus in Kolkata, Chennai, and other areas. Outbreaks of Chikungunya have also been documented at regular intervals along the east cost of India and in Maharashtra till 1960s. In 2006, an outbreak occurred in India with 2500 cases reported. About 70% cases were from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. But often there are no outbreaks. No antiviral therapy or vaccine is available.O'nyong-nyong virus: This virus is restricted to Africa and was first reported from Uganda. The virus, closely related to Chikungunya virus antigenically, is transmitted by Anopheles mosquito.Semliki forest virus: This virus is yet to be associated with any human disease, although serum antibodies against this virus have been demonstrated in African population.Sindbis virus: Sindbis virus was first reported from Culex mosquito in Egypt in 1952. Since then the virus has been reported from other parts of Africa, Philippines, and Australia. Serological evidence of Sindbis virus by demonstration of anti-bodies in the serum has been demonstrated in India.Ross river virus: The virus has been associated with epidemic polyarthritis in Australia. Rubivirus Rubella virus Rubella is not transmitted by any arthropod vector. Rubella virus is described in detail in Chapter originally named as group B arboviruses. They are similar to togaviruses in that they are also single-stranded RNA viruses and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid sur-rounded by an envelope. They are slightly smaller (40-50 nm in diameter) than those of an Alphavirus, and the RNA does not have a polyadenylate sequence. The virus also lacks a con-spicuous capsid structure in the virion. All flaviviruses are serologically related, and antibodies to one virus cross-react with another virus. The genus flavivirus contains more than 70 viruses, of which nearly 13 viruses can cause infection in humans. Most of these infections are transmitted either by mosquitoes or by ticks. However, hepatitis C virus is transmitted neither by mosqui-toes nor by ticks. The flaviviruses causing infections in humans are classified as follows: 1. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses A. Encephalitis viruses (a) St. Louis encephalitis virus (b) Ilheus virus (c) West Nile virus (d) Murray Valley encephalitis virus (e) Japanese encephalitis virus B. Yellow fever virus C. Dengue virus 2. Tick-borne flaviviruses A. Tick -borne encephalitis viruses virus (b) Powassan virus B. Tick-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses (a) Kyasanur forest disease (b) Omsk hemorrhagic fever C. Hepatitis C virus Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses Encephalitis viruses St. Louis encephalitis virus: St. Louis encephalitis virus is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the United States. It is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. Wild birds, such as English sparrows, are the reservoir hosts. Humans are the dead-end host. These viruses are mostly seen in urban areas because these mosquitoes breed in stagnant waste water. The virus causes encephalitis, which is associated with a mortality rate of 10%. Isolation of the virus is difficult; hence diagnosis is mostly based on serology. No antiviral therapy or vaccine is available.Ilheus virus: The virus occurs mostly in South and Central America. The infection is maintained in forests by bats and mosquitoes. The virus usually causes asymptomatic infection and rarely causes encephalitis.West Nile virus: West Nile virus causes encephalitis. The virus is endemic in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Wild birds are the main reservoirs of the virus. The infection is transmitted from wild birds to humans by Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mos- quitoes. Humans are the dead-end hosts. The virus first causes asymptomatic or symptomatic illness in the wild migratory birds. These infected birds contain high titer of the viruses and remain viremic for 1-2 weeks. These serve as important reser-voirs of infection for transmission to humans, horses, dogs, and other small animals after being bitten by mosquitoes. The virus like other arthropod-borne viruses causes vire- mia, crosses blood-brain barrier, and infects the brain paren-chyma causing viral encephalitis. Patients with this virus may present with features of encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, or both. This condition has also been reported from India, and the virus has been isolated from Culex mosquitoes. The virus has been isolated from the brain of these fatal cases of encephalitis in Karnataka in 1980-1981. Mental confusion and disorientation with decreased consciousness are some of the manifestations of patients with encephalitis. The infec-tion usually occurs in summer months when humans, mos-quitoes, and wild migratory birds remain in close proximity outdoors. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by isolation of the virus from blood within the first 2 weeks of infection; the virus cannot be isolated from CSF. Enzyme immunoas-say and plaque reduction utilization test are available for the specific diagnosis of the condition by demonstration of specific antibodies in serum. A fourfold or greater rise of antibody titers between acute and convalescent titer is diag-nostic of the infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also available. No antiviral therapy or vaccine for the virus is available. This is an infection that can be transmitted by transfusion of contaminated blood. Hence, PCR and nucleic acid probes specific for the virus are used to screen the blood for the virus.Murray Valley encephalitis virus: This virus is endemic in New Guinea and Australia. The virus occurs in enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and wild birds. Culex annulirostris is the main vector. The virus was first reported during an epidemic of encephalitis in Murray River Valley in 1951, and hence was called Murray Valley encephalitis virus.Japanese encephalitis virus: JE virus is a flavivirus, which causes JE, the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis. JE virus is a single-stranded RNA virus closely related to St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus. The virus was first isolated in Japan during an epidemic of encephalitis in 1935. The virus initially was called Japanese B encephalitis to distin-guish it from the Japanese A encephalitis virus (Wang Ecunoms type A encephalitis), which had different epidemiological prop-erties. In India, the virus was first reported in 1955, during an outbreak of encephalitis in Tamil Nadu. Birds and pigs are two main reservoir hosts. JE is transmit- ted to humans by certain species of Culex mosquitoes widely prevalent in rice fields in Asia. The disease is spread throughout mostly in rural areas of Asia by culicine mosquitoes, most often Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Natural infection occurs in Ardeid birds, such as herons and egrets, and the virus is transmitted from bird to bird by C. tritaeniorhynchus. Chap-65.indd 539 5/14/2012 1:02:56 PMSection IV Chapter 65540 VIROLOGY Key Points Birds act as a reservoir host from which the virus is trans-mitted to humans through several species of culicine mosquitoes. Pigs are usually the amplifier host. Humans, cattle, buffaloes, and pigs are the vertebrate hosts. C. tritaeniorhynchus is a major vector that has predilection for cattle and bites them in preference to humans or pigs, but since the cattle does not develop viremia, this does not contribute to the spread of the disease. The high cattle to pig ratio in India is a major factor that has been suggested to control infection in India. The bite of infected mosquitoes transmits JE virus to humans. The virus initially replicates at the site of the bite and in the regional lymph nodes. Subsequently, the virus spreads through circulation, causing viremia and leading to inflammatory changes in the reticuloendothelial system, heart, lungs, and liver. Usually, most infections are cleared before the virus infects the central nervous system (CNS) causing subclinical disease. However, neurological invasion can also occur possibly by growth of the virus across vascular endothelial cells, thereby affecting the large parts of brain including the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. Circulating antibodies play an important role in conferring heterologous immunity against JE. Most of the infections are asymptomatic. Only 1 in 250 infections results in symptomatic disease. Most symptomatic infections occur in young children between 2 and 10 years and in elderly people in endemic areas. In nonendemic areas, the infection occurs in all the age groups. Incubation period of JE varies from 4 to 15 days. The condi- tion has an abrupt onset with appearance of symptoms, which include fever, headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and myal-gia, which may last for several days. This is followed by altered state of consciousness, tremors, incoordination, and convul-sions. Seizures develop in two-thirds of people\u2014most often in children, while headache and meningismus are more common in adults. Mortality rate is high; in less-developed areas with poor medical care, the mortality rate may exceed 35%. More than 10,000 reported deaths occur per year due to JE worldwide. The neurological sequelae are severe and can occur in many patients who suffer from the disease. The neurological sequelae include seizure disorder, movement disorder, or motor or cranial nerve paralysis. JE is a seasonal disease with most cases occurring in temper- ate areas from June to September. In subtropical areas, trans-mission begins as early as March and extends until October. Transmission may occur earlier in some subtropical areas, such as Indonesia. Approximately, 35,000-50,000 symptom-atic cases are reported per year worldwide, although this is slightly an underestimation of the true incidence of the disease. Approximately 3 billion people currently live in areas endemic for JE, which extend from India to Maritime, Siberia, and Japan. The disease occurs throughout Asia, but is most prevalent in Southeast Asia. JE in India was first reported from Vellore, Tamil Nadu, and Pondicherry in 1950s. Since then the condition has been reported in all the states and union territories of India. An estimated 378 million people are living at the risk of JE in 12 states, union territories that are frequently affected. Several outbreaks of JE have occurred in Bankura and Burdwan in West Bengal, Dibrugarh Pondicherry, and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. Rapid agricultural development and intensive rice cultivation sup-ported by irrigation systems facilitating breeding of culicine mosquitoes is primarily responsible for the spread of the condition to newer areas in India. An epidemic of JE virus occurred in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India in 2005 and also throughout Nepal. During this epidemic, more than 5000 cases were reported and approximately 1000 deaths were documented. C. tritaeniorhynchus is the most important mosquito spe- cies that transmits JE. This mosquito has a peculiar habit to bite outdoors and is extremely active in the evening and night. These mosquitoes breed in collection of water, typically rice fields, thereby increasing the risk of infections in rural areas. Low-grade, short-term viremia occurs in humans and other mammals; hence these are dead-end hosts for the virus. Pigs are the amplifying hosts, because they have persistent, high-grade viremia and help in transmission of the virus in humans living close to the pig-rearing areas. Laboratory diagnosis of JE is made by isolating the virus from the blood during the first week of illness. The CSF rarely yields virus except in severe or fatal cases. Serodiagnosis is made by using ELISA for demonstration of IgM antibodies in serum or CSF (Fig. 65-1). This test has a high sensitivity, nearing 100%. The test may show false-positive reaction with serum from other febrile illnesses, such as dengue and West Nile fever or with the serum collected after vaccination with yellow fever and JE. The IgM antibodies are present in serum or CSF in approximately three-fourths of patients within the first 4 days after onset of illness and in nearly all the patients after 7 days of illness. Direct fluorescent antibody test is a FIG. 65-1. IgM ELISA for serodiagnosis of Japanese encephalitis. Chap-65.indd 540 5/14/2012 1:02:56 PMSection IV Chapter 65ARBOVIRUSES 541 rapid method for detection of viral antigen directly in the brain tissue. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to demonstrate viral genome in the CSF and blood for diagnosis of JE. There is no specific antiviral therapy available for treatment of JE. Prevention consists of the use of inactivated mouse-brain-derived vaccine using the Nakayama strain. Mosquito eradication and measures to prevent mosquito bite, such as use of mosquito nets, mosquito repellants, and insecticides are useful to prevent transmission of infection. Vaccines Inactivated mouse-brain-derived vaccine using the Nakayama strain: The vaccine is approximately 100% immunogenic after three doses. Two doses of the vaccine are administered at 2 weeks' interval followed by a booster dose after 6-12 months. The vaccine is recommended for persons living in epidemic and endemic areas and for travelers planning to visit these areas. Vaccine is also useful in pig population to prevent epidemics. Yellow fever virus Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne acute febrile illness that occurs in Africa and South America. The disease is not reported in India. Yellow fever virus is the type-specific virus of the family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, enveloped, RNA virus. The envelope consists of a lipid bilayer containing an envelope gly-coprotein and a matrix protein. The single RNA is complexed with a capsid protein. Yellow fever is transmitted by the bite of Ades mosquito. During blood meal, the mosquito deposits the saliva contain-ing the virus into a bite wound. The virus replicates locally and in regional lymph nodes draining the wound. Subsequently, the virus spreads by blood to the bone marrow, liver, myocardium, spleen where further replication of virus occurs. The condition is associated with hemorrhagic manifestations occurring as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation. This occurs due to bleeding from the gastrointestinal mucosa and from abdominal and pleural serous layers. This is associated with reduction in the synthesis of coagulation factor and altered platelet function. The condition progresses to shock and finally death due to mul-tiple organ failure involving liver, kidney, brain, and heart. Host immunity is characterized by the presence of viral neu- tralizing antibodies by the end of the first week during which the virus is rapidly cleared from the circulation. The role of immunity in the pathogenesis of the disease is not known. An attack of yellow fever confers a lifelong immunity. Incubation period is short and varies from 3 to 6 days. No prodromal symptoms occur. As the name suggests, yellow fever is characterized by jaun- dice and fever. This is an illness characterized by an acute onset of fever followed by jaundice within 2 weeks of onset of symp-toms. Typically, symptoms begin suddenly with fever, chill, malaise, prostration, headache, giddiness, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. This may be associated with bleed-ing from the nose, gums, gastrointestinal tract, or skin that usually occurs within a few weeks of illness. Hemorrhagic dia-thesis progressing to disseminated intravascular coagulation is the most important complication of the disease. Multiple organ failure involving liver, kidney, and heart is responsi-ble for death of the patient. Yellow fever is a severe and life- threatening disease. The yellow fever is endemic in South America and in the Caribbean enzootic countries of Africa. Although yellow fever can be transmitted in Asian countries, till now no documented transmission of yellow fever has been reported from Asian coun-tries including India. It has been suggested that previous infec-tion with another flavivirus, such as dengue virus, may confer protection from yellow fever virus. This is the reason suggested for the absence of yellow fever in Asian countries including India. Yellow fever shows following transmission cycles:Jungle (sylvatic) cycle: In this cycle, the mosquito transmits the virus to wild, nonhuman primates; from these hosts, it is transmitted to another mosquito. Humans are the incidental hosts in the cycle. This sylvatic cycle is present in rain forests, and the humans, such as men clearing the trees in the forest are bitten by the mosquito. Aedes species are the main vectors in Africa. Wild Aedes species are the vectors in South America.Urban cycle: This cycle is confined to urban areas in which the mosquitoes transmit the virus to a human host and then it is transmitted to another mosquito. A. aegypti, a domestic mos-quito, is the primary vector.Intermediate cycle: This cycle is confined to Savanna forest area of Africa and is the most common cycle responsible for outbreaks of yellow fever in Africa. In this cycle, the mosquito transmits the virus to wild nonhuman primates and human hosts and then it is transmitted to another mosquito. The yellow fever is transmitted from infected humans to mosquitoes, which are diurnal feeders. Humans suffering from the disease during initial 3-4 weeks of illness are the source of infection. The extrinsic incubation period is 12-21 days. Vertical transmission of yellow fever takes place from female mosquitoes to the female progeny in 1% of cases. This is the important reason for the survival of the virus in dry season. Approximately, 3-10 variants are necessary to infect a mos-quito. Seasonal transmission of yellow fever occurs during mid-rainy season and early dry season in Africa. In South America, this occurs from January to March. An estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever occur in Africa and South America, causing 20,000-30,000 deaths annually. Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever can be made by: Isolation of yellow fever virus from the clinical specimens. Demonstration of IgM-specific antibodies in the serum or demonstration of fourfold or more rise in serum IgG. Detection of yellow fever antigen in tissues by immuno histochemistry Detection of viral genomes by PCR, and Elevated transaminase and bilirubin levels, which are dem-onstrated during the toxic stage of illness. Chap-65.indd 541 5/14/2012 1:02:56 PMSection IV Chapter 65542 VIROLOGY Vaccination is the most widely used preventive measure against yellow fever (refer the box Vaccines). Other preven-tive measures include mosquito eradication program and personal protective measures. The latter include the use of proper clothings, insect repellants, etc., which avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and thereby exposure to yellow fever virus. Vaccines The 17 D strain of yellow fever virus is a widely used attenu-ated live virus vaccine. This avirulent 17 D strain vaccine was recovered during the serial passage of a pantropic strain of yel-low fever virus through tissue culture. The strain that has lost its capacity to induce viscerotropic or neurotropic disease has been used as a vaccine for more than 40 years. The vaccine, which is prepared in eggs and is available as a dried powder, is maintained in cold chain for effective immunization. The vaccine is highly effective. A single dose of vaccine produces neutralizing antibodies\u2014indicator of protection in more than 99% of vaccinated people by 30 days. The vaccine provides immunity mainly for 30-35 years and probably for whole life after a single dose. The vaccine is highly safe, associated with very few side effects. The vaccine is indicated for (a) all the individuals residing in countries endemic for yellow fever and ( b) travelers visiting to the countries South America and Africa. The vaccine is contraindicated for (a) infants below 9 months, (b) pregnant mothers, and (c) individuals with immune deficiency diseases, such as HIV or persons receiving organ transplantation, etc. Dengue virus Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne arboviral ill-ness caused by dengue virus. The name dengue is derived from a Swahili word ki-dinga-pepo meaning a sudden seizure by a Demon. The earliest known documentation of symptoms of dengue-like illness was described in Chinese Encyclopedia dur-ing 265 AD. In 1780, Rauss coined the term \"break-bone fever\" based on description of symptoms reported by patients during Philadelphia epidemics of probably dengue fever. The possible outbreak of dengue fever epidemics were documented sporadi-cally every 10-30 years until World War II. Subsequently, after World War II the dengue fever spread and became worldwide. The first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was described in 1963 in Manila. In 1979-1980, the first reported outbreak of dengue fever occurred simultaneously in Asia, Africa, and North America. Properties of the virus Morphology: Dengue virus is a small, spherical, and enveloped virus. It is a flavivirus having a cubic symmetry and measures 40-50 nm in diameter. It is a single-stranded RNA virus of 11 kb size. It has an icosahedral nucleocapsid and is covered by a lipid envelope. The virus is inactivated by diethyl ether and bile salts, such as sodium deoxycholate.Viral replication: The replication cycle is similar to that of other flaviviruses, such as yellow fever virus.Antigenic and genomic properties: Dengue virus has four The speciation was done by Albert Sabbin in 1944. Each serotype is known to have several different genotypes. Pathogenesis and immunity Humans acquire infection and become infected with the virus by the bite of Aedes mosquito vector. The leakage of plasma caused by increased capillary permeability is the major patho-physiological abnormality that occurs in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Bleeding, which is most important manifestation in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever, is caused due to capillary fragility and thrombocytope-nia, and it manifests by various ways ranging from petechial skin hemorrhages to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. Key Points Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome is seen in most patients who have had prior infection with one or more dengue serotypes. It is postulated that prior infection with one or more dengue serotypes causes the development of low levels of neu-tralizing antibodies as well as high level of non-neutralizing antibodies. In the same patient on reinfection with another serotype of dengue virus, the virus antibody complexes are formed within a few days of second dengue infection. This results in an increase in viral entry and replication of a higher number of mononuclear cells followed by the release of cytokines, vasoac-tive mediators, and few coagulants. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement and is responsible primar-ily for the disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in the patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever. In addition, certain dengue strains particularly of dengue 2 are being considered to be more virulent. This is because more epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been associated with dengue 2 than with other serotypes.Host immunity: Infection with dengue virus confers lifelong immunity. The immunity is serotype specific. Infection by one serotype does not confer protection against other serotypes. The infection with dengue virus of different serotypes may cause a more severe disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Although dengue and yellow fever viruses are antigenically related, infection with dengue virus does not result in significant cross-immunity against yellow fever virus. Clinical syndromes The dengue virus causes classic dengue or break-bone fever characterized by fever, muscle and joint pain, lymphadenopathy, and rash. In addition, it also causes dengue hemorrhagic fever, i.e., a much more severe disease than classic dengue fever with a high fatality rate. Chap-65.indd 542 5/14/2012 1:02:57 PMSection IV Chapter 65ARBOVIRUSES 543 Classic dengue fever: The incubation period varies from 2 to 7 days. The onset of the disease is sudden, which begins as influenza-like illness manifesting as fever, malaise, cough, and headache. The fever, which may be as high as 41\u00b0C, typically begins on the third day and lasts for 5-7 days. The fever is typically biphasic, coinciding with the absence of virus in the blood. A maculopapular rash usually appears on third or fourth day of the illness. The rash lasts for 1-5 days, fading with desquamation. Severe pain in muscles and deep bone pain and joint pain (break-bone fever) are characteristic. Enlarged lymph nodes and leukopenia are also seen. Classic dengue fever is a self-limiting disease. It is rarely fatal and has few sequelae and complications. The convalescent phase may last for 2 weeks.Dengue hemorrhagic fever: Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a most severe manifestation of the disease. The initial classic phase of dengue hemorrhagic fever is similar to that of dengue fever and other febrile viral illnesses. But, subsequently, the condition of the patient suddenly worsens with shock and hemorrhage, especially into the gastrointestinal tract and skin. The hemorrhagic manifestations include bleeding from nose or gums, melena, and hematemesis. This condition shows a high fatality rate as high as 10%. It occurs in children with passively acquired maternal antibodies. It may also occur in a person previously infected with a different serotype of the virus, showing non-neutralizing heterologous antibodies in the serum.Dengue shock syndrome: It is the most severe form of the disease caused by dengue virus. This is most commonly seen in untreated cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The common symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, and restlessness and finally, the patient may die of circulatory failure and shock. When treated, dengue hemorrhagic fever has a mortality rate of 5%; if left untreated, the condition has a mortality rate as high as 50%. Epidemiology Dengue virus is distributed worldwide. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is primarily a disease of children and a leading cause of death in Southeast Asia.Geographical distribution: An estimated 3 billion people living in approximately 110 countries worldwide are at a risk of dengue infection. Every year, approximately 100 million people are infected with dengue worldwide. Dengue hemorrhagic fever occurs in approximately 2.51 lakhs of affected persons.Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection: Humans are reservoirs of the infection. The human host serves as source of viral amplification. Humans are infectious to mosquitoes during viremia for 3-5 days. The infection is transmitted by bite of A. aegypti mosquitoes. After feeding, the virus shows an extrinsic incubation period of 10-14 days in the mosquito, before the mosquito becomes infectious. The mosquitoes are vectors as well as sources of viral amplification. A. aegypti are small and highly domesticated mosquitoes, which breed on artificial water sources, and they prefer to bite humans typically at the back of the neck and at the ankles.The initial epidemics of dengue were documented in urban areas, but with recent increase in epidemics of dengue, the con-dition has spread to suburban and rural areas also. Dengue has been spreading from Southeast Asia to the subtropical and tropical Asian countries, Indian subcontinent including India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, New Guinea, Australia, and several pacific islands. The first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was described in Manila, Philippines in 1953. Subsequently, dengue hemor-rhagic fever has spread more rapidly with epidemics occurring yearly and major outbreaks occurring every 3 years. Currently, dengue hemorrhagic fever is one of the leading causes of death and hospitalization in children in many Southeast Asian countries. Unplanned urban development with population explosion and inadequate public health facility, poor vector control, and increased travel to the endemic areas have contributed for spread of dengue worldwide. Dengue was initially restricted to east coast of India. Subsequently, the virus has affected most parts of India. In India, the first report of dengue included isolation of dengue serotypes 1 and 4 in 1964 followed by serotype 3 in 1968. Since then the reports of dengue have been documented from vari-ous parts of the India including Vellore, Pondicherry, Chennai, Mangalore, Kolkata, Assam, Lucknow, Delhi, and Haryana. The higher incidence of dengue has been reported in children younger than 8 years. An endemic of dengue was reported between September 2001 and January 2002 in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Nearly 8000 cases were officially identified. Subsequently, a major outbreak of dengue was observed in western India during October 2002 to December 2003. The dengue etiology was confirmed by viro-logical and serological studies. Laboratory diagnosis Specimens: Blood collected during first 3-5 days of illness is useful for isolation of virus, and serum is useful for serological tests.Isolation of the virus: Diagnosis of dengue is confirmed by isolation of virus from blood during first 3-5 days of illness. The virus can be isolated in various cell cultures.Serodiagnosis: Serodiagnosis of dengue fever is based on the demonstration of IgM immunoglobulin in a single serum sample or rise in IgG antibodies in paired serum specimens. The IgM capture ELISA (MacELISA) is the most widely used test for demonstration of IgM antibody in the serum. Neutralization test, hemagglutination inhibition, and IgG ELISA are the other serological tests used for diagnosis of the condition. Molecular Diagnosis Recently, an RT-PCR is being used for genomic detection of dengue virus in the clinical specimen, but the test is now restricted only for use in research laboratories. Chap-65.indd 543 5/14/2012 1:02:57 PMSection IV Chapter 65544 VIROLOGY Treatment No specific antiviral treatment is available to treat dengue infection. Prevention and control No vaccine is available for prevention of dengue infection. The preventive measures are based mostly on mosquito- control activities. These include the use of insecticides and clearing the stagnant water and artificial collections of water that serve as breeding ground for the mosquitoes. Personal control mea-sures include wearing good protective clothings and use of mosquito nets, mosquito repellants, etc. caused by Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus is transmitted by the bite of ixodid ticks. This condition, prevalent in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia, is transmitted mainly by the bite of ticks. Transovarial transmission of the virus takes place in ticks and makes it an important reservoir host. Wild rodents and birds are the other reservoirs. Ingestion of infected meat obtained from infected goats may also transmit the infection to humans. Avoidance of tick bite is an important control measure. A formalin-treated Russian spring-summer encephalitis vaccine has also been found to be useful.Powassan virus: Powassan virus is another tick-borne virus causing Powassan encephalitis. This has been reported from Canada and northern United States. Tick-borne hemorrhagic fever Kyasanur forest disease: KFD is an example of tick-borne hemorrhagic fever. This disease is called so, because this was first reported in Kyasanur forest of Karnataka in 1957. The virus was associated with a fatal epizootic, affecting monkeys along with severe illness in some of the villages in the area. The causative virus was isolated from the patients and from dead monkeys. After an incubation period of 3-7 days, the KFD manifests with a sudden onset of fever associated with headache, vom-iting, conjunctivitis, myalgia, and severe prostration. In some of the cases, bleeding through gastrointestinal tract and chest cavity may occur. The condition is associated with a case fatal-ity of 5%. The infection is mostly transmitted by the bite of the tick Haemaphysalis spinigera. The tick also acts as the reservoir host because the virus is transmitted transovarially. The monkeys appear to act as amplifier host, but not reservoir host because monkeys die of the infection. The KFD is mostly localized in distribution and confined to Shimoga district of Karnataka. The disease remained restricted to north Karnataka between 1972 and 1975. Subsequently, the outbreaks of the disease were reported in Velthabelthangadi in South Karnataka between December 1982 and May 1983. During this outbreak, a total of 1142 human cases were reported with 104 deaths. No specific antiviral treatment is available. Prevention of the disease is based primarily on control of ticks and personal protection by using adequate clothings and insect repellants. A killed KFD vaccine is also available for use against the KFD.Omsk hemorrhagic fever: This fever is caused by a virus related to KFD. The condition is transmitted by bites of Dermacentor ticks and it occurs in Russia and Romania. Clinical manifestations of the disease are similar to that of KFD. Hepatitis C virus The virus is not an arbovirus hence has been described in detail in Chapter 66. Bunyaviridae Viruses Bunyaviridae viruses are large, spherical (80-120 nm in diam-eter), and have a triple-segmented and a single-stranded RNA. They have a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope. They replicate in the cytoplasm, and the assembly of the virion occurs by budding on smooth membrane of the Golgi system. Bunyaviridae viruses consist of more than 200 viruses. On the basis of structural and biochemical properties, they are classi-fied into four genera: Bunyavirus, Hantavirus, Nairovirus, and Phlebovirus. All these viruses, with the exception of hantaviruses, are arboviruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, and flies. The hantaviruses, however, are transmitted by rodents. Genus Bunyavirus includes more than 150 members includ- ing La Crosse virus, California encephalitis virus, and Chittor virus. These three viruses are related antigenically and produce similar clinical diseases. These viral infections are transmitted by mosquitoes. Hantaviruses are spherical viruses measuring 90-120 nm in diameter. They include Hantann virus (Korean hemorrhagic fever), Seoul virus, and Sin Nombre virus. All these viruses cause hemorrhagic fever with nephropathy. These viruses are transmitted by close contact with rodents, such as mice and rats, and not by arthropod vectors. Transmission of infection occurs by inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodents. A newly identified hantavirus, the Sin Nombre virus, is the causative agent of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which was first identified in the United States in 1993. The infection is acquired by inhalation of aerosols of rodent excreta. No arthropods are responsible for the transmission of the disease. Genus Nairovirus includes six members consisting of Nairobi sheep disease virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. All these viruses are transmitted by Haemaphysalis ticks. Nairoviruses are primarily pathogenic for sheep. They cause infection in sheep and are responsible for mortality and mor-bidity, thereby causing severe economical loss for the farmers. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is the most important Nairovirus, which Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Chap-65.indd PMSection IV Chapter 65ARBOVIRUSES 545 humans. Ganjam virus is a related virus, which causes infection of sheep in India. Genus Phlebovirus includes more than 36 members including sandfly (Phlebotomus) fever virus and Rift Valley fever virus. All these viruses are transmitted by different arthropods, such as ticks, sandflies, and mosquitoes. As the name suggests, the sandfly fever virus is transmitted by female species of sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi. The sandfly fever virus has 20 serotypes, of which only five cause human disease. These are Sicilian, Naples, Panta Toro, Chagrss, and Candine. Rift Valley fever virus is a primary pathogen of sheep and other domestic animals. This fever was originally described in Rift Valley, Kenya, and hence was designated as Rift Valley fever. Humans are secondarily infected on contact with infected sheep and other domestic animals. Humans acquire the infec-tion from these reservoir animals through the mosquito bites. Bunyaviridae virus is surrounded by an envelope which contains two glycoproteins, G1 and G2. The capsule encloses three unique negative RNAs (large, L; medium, M; and small, S) that are associated with proteins to form nucleocapsid. The Bunyaviridae viruses unlike other negative-stranded RNA viruses do not have any matrix protein. They replicate in the cytoplasm of the infected cell in the same way as that of other enveloped and negative-stranded viruses. Bunyaviridae viruses can infect humans and arthropods. Bite by an arthropod vector, such as mosquito, transmits infec-tion to humans. The virus from the site of infection spreads to the blood causing initial viremia, which may manifest in flu-like symptoms. Further dissemination of the viruses during the phase of secondary viremia may allow the viruses to reach target sites, such as liver, kidney, vascular endothelium, and CNS. In the CNS, many viruses cause and glial damage and cere-bral edema, leading to encephalitis. Other Bunyaviridae viruses, such as Rift Valley fever virus, may cause hepatic infection, whereas hantana hemorrhagic disease and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses cause hemorrhagic tissue destruction accompanied by hemorrhagic neurosis of the kidney. Infection by Bunyaviridae viruses leads to development of both the antibody- and cell-mediated immunities. The anti-body-mediated immunity may control viremia, whereas the cell-mediated immunity and interferon may prevent further spread of the infection. Bunyaviruses usually cause a nonspecific febrile flu-like illness that is indistinguishable from illness caused by other viruses. The incubation period is usually short (48 hours), and the fever lasts approximately for 3 days. California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, and Rift Valley fever cause encephalitis. The condition begins with a sud-den onset after an incubation period of nearly 1 week. Fever, lethargy, headache, and vomiting are the common symptoms. Seizers usually occur in nearly half of the patients with enceph-alitis. The condition may be associated with meningitis. The illness lasts for approximately 7 days. The condition is fatal in less than 1% of patients. The sandfly fever has an incubation period of 3-5 days, after which the patients develop headache, malaise, fever, and nau-sea, which last for 3-4 days.Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever viruses cause hemorrhagic fever. The condition is character-ized by petechial hemorrhage, ecchymosis, hematemesis, and melena. Death 75% patients with hemorrhagic manifestations. The hantavirus typically causes hantavirus pulmonary syn- drome, which is more serious disease consisting of prodromal fever and muscle aches. The condition progresses rapidly to interstitial pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and death within a few days. The hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The cases resemble those of leptospirosis and scrub typhus. Most of the bunyaviruses are distributed in Africa, South America, South-eastern Europe, and southern Asia. The sand-fly fever is distributed in Mediterranean countries and central Asia including India. These viruses are transmitted by arthro-pod vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks, or Phlebotomus flies to rodents, birds, and larger animals, which are the usual reser-voirs of infection. Humans acquire infection from the reservoir animals by arthropod vectors. The arthropods transmit the infection by biting on the skin. Aedes mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of California encephalitis virus and La Crosse virus. Flies, such as sandfly transmit Rift Valley fever virus and Sandfly fever virus. Ticks are the vectors for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Hantaviruses are not transmitted by any vectors; humans instead are infected by close contact with rodents or by inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine. The incidence of the disease caused by bunyaviruses correlates well with the distri-bution of vectors. The disease is more common during sum-mer months. Serodiagnosis is most important in the laboratory diag- nosis of Bunyaviridae virus infection. ELISA for demonstra-tion of serum IgG or IgM antibodies is useful for diagnosis of bunyavirus infections. Demonstration of specific IgM antibody in a single serum or demonstration of a fourfold increase in the IgG antibody titer indicates recent infection. IgM ELISA is used for serodiagnosis of infection caused by hantaviruses. Demonstration of rising titers of hemaggluti-nating antibodies in paired sera is diagnostic of the disease. The ELISA for demonstration of antigen in the blood is also useful for diagnosis of patients with intense viremia, being observed in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, hantana hemorrhagic disease with renal syndrome, and Rift Valley fever. Molecular diagnosis is the recent method. The RT-PCR has been used to detect viral genomes in the tissues during the infection caused by the Sin Nombre and Convict Creek hantaviruses. No specific antiviral therapy is available for bunyavirus infection. Avoidance of close contact of humans with arthro-pod vectors, such as mosquitoes, ticks, or Phlebotomus flies prevents transmission of infection caused by bunyaviruses. Arthropod vector control measures include use of insecticides, wearing protective gloves and clothing, use of net and screens, and control of tick infestation of animals. Control of rodent population minimizes the transmission of infection caused by Chap-65.indd 545 5/14/2012 1:02:57 PMSection IV Chapter 65546 VIROLOGY hantaviruses. Human diseases associated with Bunyaviridae viruses are summarized in Table 65-2. Reoviridae The family consists of four Orbivirus, and Rotavirus) of which only orbiviruses transmitted by arthropods. These viruses have double-stranded RNA genome by which they differ from other arboviruses. Colorado tick-borne virus is the only orbivirus, which causes infection in humans. The virus causes Colorado tick fever transmitted by the tick Dermacentor andersoni . The virus causes natural infection in rodents. The disease is restricted in its distribution to the western United States. The virus causes a self-limiting disease in humans.Kasba, Vellore, and Palyam are the arboviruses that have been isolated from mosquitoes in India. Their association with the disease in humans is yet to be ascertained. Rhabdoviridae The genus Vesiculovirus of the family Rhabdoviridae consists of Chandipura virus, which has been associated with human infection in India. This is an arthropod-borne virus transmit-ted by both sandfly and Aedes mosquito. The virus was first reported from Nagpur in 1967 from the blood of patients during the epidemic of dengue and chikungunya fever. Their pathogenic role in human disease is not known. Ungrouped Arboviruses Wanowri Virus This virus has been isolated from the brain of a girl who died of fever after 2 days in Sri Lanka. The same virus has also been isolated from Hyalomma ticks in India. Bhanja Virus Bhanja virus has been isolated from goats in Ganjam (Odisha) from India. The same virus has been shown to be associated with human infection reported from Yugoslavia.Virus Disease Bunyavirus hemorrhagic fever, and Nairobi sheep disease Hantavirus Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (Sin Nombre virus), shock, pulmonary edemaTABLE 65-2 Diseases associated with Bunyaviridae There was an outbreak of JE in and around Tamil Nadu few years back. As a preventive measure to stop further dissemina-tion of the disease, rural people engaged in pig farming were advised to be away from pig herds and measures were initi-ated for control of mosquito population. What is the basis of advising people to be away from pig population? How is JE transmitted in a community? What are the laboratory tests used for establishing the diagnosis of JE? Is there any vaccine against JE?CASE STUDY Chap-65.indd 546 5/14/2012 1:02:57 PM66 Introduction Hepatitis is a clinical syndrome caused by many pathogens including viruses. There are six medically important viruses that are called hepatitis viruses because their main site of infec-tion is liver. These viruses are hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), and newly described G virus (HGV). Although these viruses infect the liver as common target organ, they however, differ greatly in their morphology, replication pattern, and course of infection. Nomenclature and definitions of different hepatitis viruses, antigens, and antibodies are listed in Table 66-1. These viruses infect the liver and cause distinct clinical pathology by producing characteristic symptoms of jaundice and production and release of liver enzymes in the serum. Most of these diseases spread very fast because infected individuals are contagious not only during stage of manifestation of the disease but also during the phase of incubation. Human infections associated with hepatitis viruses are summarized in Table 66-2. Hepatitis A Virus Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a picornavirus that is most com-monly transmitted by fecal-oral route. It has a relatively short incubation period of 3-4 weeks after which jaundice starts suddenly. It is unique in that it does not cause chronic disease or fatal disease. Properties of the Virus Morphology Hepatitis A virus shows following morphological features: It is a typical enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. It is a small, nonenveloped virus measuring 27 nm in diameter (Fig. 66-1). It has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The HAV was originally designated as enterovirus, but it is recognized as a prototype of Hepatovirus . The naked capsid is more stable than other picornaviruses to acid and other treatment. Viral replication Hepatitis A virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. It has a replicative cycle similar to that of other picornaviruses. Briefly, it combines specifically with a receptor expressed on liver cells and few other cells. However, unlike other picornavi-ruses, it is not cytolytic and is released by exocytosis. Antigenic and genomic properties There is only one serotype in HAV. The virus does not show any antigenic relationship with hepatitis B or other hepatitis viruses. Other properties Hepatitis A virus is highly resistant to environmental factors. It is stable at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour, 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, and 4\u00b0C for weeks. It is stable to acidic pH, at pH 1. It is resistant to Hepatitis Viruses Virus Abbreviations Definition Hepatitis A HAVIgM HAVAbHepatitis A virusIgM antibody to HAV Hepatitis B HBVHBsAgHbcAgHbeAgHBsAbHBcAbHBeAbHepatitis B virusHepatitis B surface antigenHepatitis B core antigenHepatitis B e antigenAntibody to HBsAgAntibody to to HBeAg C virusAntibody to HCV Hepatitis D HDVHDAgHepatitis D virusDelta antigen Hepatitis E HEV Hepatitis E virusTABLE 66-1 Nomenclature and definitions of hepatitis viruses, antigens, and antibodies Virus Diseases HAV Acute hepatitisHBV Acute and chronic hepatitisHCV Acute HCV infection, chronic HCV infection, and cirrhosis and other complications HDV Acute self-limited infection to acute fulminant liver failureHEV Serious infection in womenHGV Coinfection in chronic HBV PMSection IV Chapter 66548 VIROLOGY inactivation by lipid solvents, such as ether and chloroform, to action of detergents, and to drying. The virus is inactivated by formalin (0.35%) at 37\u00b0C during a period of 24 hours and by treatment with peracetic acid (2%) for 4 hours and beta-propiolactone (0.25%) for 1 hour. It is also inac-tivated by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (2 /H9262W/cm 2/minute). The virus is inactivated by routine chlorine treatment of drink-ing water. Virus Isolation and Animal Susceptibility Hepatitis A is the only virus that can be grown in human and simian cell culture. However, it is difficult to grow routinely from feces of infected patients. Pathogenesis and Immunity Hepatitis A virus infection is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and is associated with hepatic injury; however, the patho-genesis of HAV infection is not completely understood. Pathogenesis of hepatitis A virus infection The virus appears to replicate first in the gastrointestinal tract and then spreads to the liver (Fig. 66-2). The viruses in the liver infect hepatocytes and cause damage to hepatocytes. But the mechanism by which HAV causes cytopathic effect is not known. Cytotoxic T cells appear to cause damage to hepa-tocytes; hence once the infection is cleared, the cell damage is repaired and no chronic infection occurs. The classic findings in the hepatocytes include mononuclear infiltrate, balloon-ing, degeneration, and acidophilic (Councilman-like) bodies. The liver pathology caused by HAV cannot be distinguished histologically from that caused by other hepatitis viruses. Host immunity Host immunity is mediated primarily by circulating anti-bodies. Acute infection is characterized by the appearance of IgM anti-HAV, which is detectable at the time of appear-ance of jaundice in the initial stage of infection. But the IgM anti body disappears several months after jaundice. The IgG antibody appears 1-3 weeks after appearance of IgM anti-bodies. IgG antibody appears to provide lifelong immunity against recurrent HAV infection.Clinical Syndrome Hepatitis A virus causes acute hepatitis A, the symptoms of which are similar to those caused by Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Acute hepatitis A The incubation period of HAV is 15-45 days, with an average of 4 weeks. It is relatively short compared to long incubation period of HBV infection. Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, fever, hepatomegaly, jaundice, anorexia, and rash are the most common signs and symptoms of the disease. The condition is also associated with passing of dark-colored urine, pale feces, and elevated serum transaminase levels. Hepatitis A virus infec-tion is usually a self-limiting mild disease and in most cases resolves spontaneously in 2-4 weeks. Hepatitis A virus infec-tion confers lifelong immunity to HAV. Chronic hepatitis or chronic carrier state does not occur with HAV infection. Hepatitis A virus also never causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Acute hepatitis A is relatively more serious and has high mortality in adults than in children. The exact cause for this is unknown. Acute liver failure and cholestatic hepatitis are some of the rare complications. The mortality caused by HAV is very low, approximately 0.01%. Epidemiology Nearly two-thirds of acute cases of hepatitis are caused by HAV. Geographical distribution Hepatitis A virus infection is common in the developing coun-tries of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. High preva-lence of HAV infection has been documented in the Middle East.StoolOral acquisition of HAV Via blood Cross intestine Bile FIG. 66-2.

Humans infected with HAV are the important source of infection. The virus is excreted in the stool during the first 2 weeks of infection, prior to the onset of symptoms; hence the quarantine of patients is not useful. The infected children and adults appear to be noninfectious after the appearance of jaundice. Contaminated food or water is the main source of infection. Wide outbreak can occur from a single contaminated source, such as uncooked vegetables, infected shellfish, and contami-nated food and water (Fig. 66-3). Key Points Hepatitis A virus infection is transmitted primarily by fecal-oral route. Most commonly, the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated water and food including shellfish collected from sewage-contaminated water. The virus is rarely transmitted by blood or blood products because the level of viremia in HAV is low and chronic infection does not occur.Infection with HAV occurs throughout the world but is more common in developing countries, in the areas of low socioeconomic status and poor sanitation. International travelers to areas endemic for HAV, drug addicts using injectable drugs, and homosexual men are at high risk for HAV infection. Close contacts of infected individuals are also at high risk. Infection is not transmitted from infected mother to neonates. Secondary infection occurs at a high rate in household contacts of acute HAV (20%). Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include (a) serum for antibody detection test and (b) liver, bile, stool, and blood for HAV antigen and genome. Direct antigen detection Hepatitis A virus is present in stools during 2 weeks prior to the onset of jaundice and up to 2 weeks after the onset of jaundice. The virus can be demonstrated in the stool during this period by using immunoelectron microscopy. Isolation of the virus Although the virus has been grown in human and simian cell culture, its isolation by culture of feces in the cell line is not routinely done, because the facilities for growing the virus are not widely available. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis of HAV infection depends on the demonstra-tion of specific antibodies in the serum. Serological tests demonstrating these anti-HAV antibodies in the serum are the most widely used to confirm the diagnosis of HAV infection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the method of choice for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum. IgM antibody is the first antibody to appear at the onset of symptoms and continues to persist at a high level for 1-2 months. It usually disappears by 4-6 months but occa-sionally persists longer. Hence, demonstration of IgM anti-body is diagnostic of a recent infection. IgG antibody appears in the serum shortly after the appearance of IgM antibodies and usually increases as the IgM level decreases. A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titers is also diagnostic of infection. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to demonstrate HAV genome in stool as well as in the serum of infected patient. Other tests Liver function tests are highly useful for supplementing the diagnosis of HAV infection. Hepatitis A virus infection is associated with a consistent increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (virus in liver)Virus ingested with saladVegetables eaten raw as salad or inadequately cookedVegetables cultivated on sewage contaminated water containing virusSewage contaminated water FIG. 66-3.

Chap-66.indd 549 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66550 VIROLOGY Increase in ALT and AST levels is nearly 4-100 times more than the normal levels. Increase in serum levels of ALT and AST are usually seen 1 week before. The ALT and AST remain at peak level within 3-10 days after the onset of clinical illness. Serum bilirubin level is also increased, and it increases with the appearance of jaundice. Decrease in serum albumin level and prolongation of prothrombin time indicate a severe hepatocellular infection. Treatment No antiviral therapy is available against HAV infection. Treatment of the condition is always supportive. Prevention and Control Prevention of HAV infection depends on: (a) vaccines, (b) prophylaxis with immune serum globulin, and (c) measures to prevent feco-oral spread of infection. Vaccines Active immunization with vaccines containing formalin- inactivated HAV is available. The vaccine is effective and safe. It is given in two doses, an initial dose followed by a booster dose after 6-12 months. No booster dose is given. Vaccine is recommended for: (a) Use in children over 2 years of age, (b) Travelers to developing countries, (c) Patients with chronic liver disease, and (d) Homosexual men. Ano ther vaccine that cont ains inactivated HAV and recombi- nant vaccine is against both HAV and HBV.. Immunoglobulin Postexposure prophylaxis consists of administration of hepati-tis A immunoglobulin to contacts within 2 weeks of exposure. The immunoglobulin is given in a dose of 0.02 mL administered intramuscularly in a single dose. Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for household contact of infected patients and contact in child-care center during outbreaks. Prevention of fecal-oral spread of infection General prevention measures consist of hand washing, drinking of safe drinking water, and good personal hygiene and sanita-tion. All these contribute to prevention of fecal-oral spread of infection of HAV. Hepatitis B Virus Hepatitis B virus is a major cause of infectious hepatitis worldwide. It is a hepadnavirus, which shows restricted host range and limited tissue tropism. The virus usually causes chronic disease and is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The term serum hepatitis was used after an outbreak of hepati-tis among American soldiers in 1942. The cause of outbreak was linked to yellow fever vaccine that was given to the soldiers which was contaminated by human serum. Blumberg and his colleagues in 1965 described the Australian antigen, which was later called hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). DS Dane in 1970 was first to describe hepatitis B viral particle in human serum by electron microscopy. Properties of the Virus Morphology Hepatitis B virus shows following features: It is a small (3.2 kb), enveloped DNA virus. The genome is a small, circular, partially double-stranded DNA. It is partially double stranded, because its positive strand is incomplete. The complete negative strand possesses four genes: genes S, C, P, and X. The gene S codes for HBsAg and also for HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen). Although HBV is a DNA virus, the gene P codes for DNA poly-merase that has reverse transcriptase activity. Gene X codes for the X protein that has transcription-regulating activity. The virion is a double-walled, spherical structure and measures 42 nm in diameter. It was first demonstrated by Dane in 1970 and so is known as Dane particle. By electron microscopy three types of particles can be seen in the serum from patients with hepatitis B. These are (i) spherical particles measuring 22 nm in diameter, (ii) filamentous or tubular particles with a diameter of 22 nm and of varying length, and (iii) double-walled, spherical structures measuring 42 nm in diameter. The former two particles are antigenically identical and are known as hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg. The latter particle is the complete hepatitis viral particle known as Dane particle (Fig. 66-4). 42 nmVirion (Dane particle) HBsAg polymerase FIG. 66-4. A schematic diagram of Dane particle and hepatitis B surf ace antigen (HBsAg). Chap-66.indd 550 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66HEPATITIS The HBV consists of nucleocapsid which surrounds HBV DNA and DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease activity. The nucleocapsid also encloses a protein attached to genome, which is surrounded by hepati-tis B core antigen (HBcAg). The envelope which encloses the virus consists of HBsAg and also HBeAg. HBsAg: This antigen consists of three glycoproteins, namely S, L, and M. These glycoproteins are all encoded by same gene. The S glycoprotein is the major component of HBsAg, which self-associates into 22-nm spherical particles that are released from the cells. The filamentous particles of HBsAg found in the serum contain large amount of S and only small amount of L and M glycoprotein, and other proteins and lipids. The glyco-protein L is essential for virion assembly and for formation of filamentous particles and retention of the structures in the cell. Viral replication Hepatitis B virus replication shows many unique features. First, the virus shows a well-defined tropism for replication in the liver. Second, although a DNA virus, it encodes reverse transcrip-tase and replicates though RNA intermediates. The virus replicates in the nucleus of the cell. The virus infects hepatocytes, the attachment of which is mediated by HBsAg glycoprotein. The infection is initiated by the binding of HBsAg to serum albumin and other serum proteins, which subsequently causes the virus to infect the liver. Inside hepa-tocytes, the partial DNA strand of the genome is converted to covalently closed circular double-stranded DNA. Later on, this genome is transported to the nucleus of the cell. The DNA acts as a template for all viral transcription including 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA. Subsequently, the genome is enclosed by virus capsular antigen. Within the core, both negative- and positive-strand DNA viruses are synthesized. Finally, the core buds from the membrane, acquiring HBsAg-containing envelope and is released from the infected cell. Antigenic and genomic properties HBsAg is antigenically complex. The HBsAg contains a group-specific antigen termed a and type-specific antigens termed d or y and w or r. Combination of these antigens results in four major subtypes of HBV (adw, adr, ayw, and ayr). These subtypes show distinct geographic distributions: Subtype ayw is common in Asia, Middle East, and western and northern India. Subtype adr is common in South and East India and in Far East countries. Subtype adw is prevalent in Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Subtype ayr is very rare. A total of eight genotypic variants (genotypes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) of HBV have also been described. The prevalence of different genotypes varies in different countries. The infection caused by the genotype C is associated with rapid progression of the disease and poor response to antiviral treatment than caused by genotype D. Other properties Hepatitis B virus is an extremely resistant virus capable of with-standing extreme temperature and humidity. It is stable when stored at /H1100220\u00b0C for 15 years, at /H1100280\u00b0C for 24 months, at 44\u00b0C for 7 days, at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes, and at room temperature for 6 months. HBV, however, is sensitive to higher temperature and is killed rapidly after heating at 100\u00b0C for 1 minute and at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours. HBsAg is a stable antigen. It is stable at pH 2.4 for up to 6 hours, but is associated with loss of infectivity of the virus. HBsAg is also destroyed by treatment with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite within 3 minutes. The HBsAg is, however, not destroyed by ultraviolet irradiation of plasma or other blood products, thereby retaining the infectivity of the virus. Pathogenesis and Immunity The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of hepatitis B infection are primarily due to the interaction of the viruses and host immune system. Pathogenesis of HBV infection Hepatitis B virus, after entering the blood, infects the hepatocytes in the liver with the expression of viral antigen on the surface of infected cells. Cytotoxic T cells, such as activated CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, recognize various HBV-derived proteins present on the surface of hepatocytes resulting in an immunological reaction. Key Points The virus by itself does not cause any cytopathic effect in the infected liver cells. The injury or cytopathic effects most probably occur as a result of cell-mediated injury. The formation of antigen-antibody complexes is respon-sible for some of the symptoms, such as arthralgia, arthritis seen during early stage of the disease. The immune complex is also responsible for some of the complications associated with chronic hepatitis, such as immune complex glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, and vasculitis. A restricted T-cell-mediated lymphocyte response occurs against the HBV-infected hepatitis. A chronic carrier stage with HBV infection is an important event in the pathogenesis of HBV infection. A person with chronic carrier stage has HBsAg persisting in the blood for at least 6 months. This stage is caused by a persistent infection of the hepatocytes that leads to the presence of HBV and HBsAg in the blood. This chronic carrier stage occurs in about 5% of patients with HBV infection in contrast to no chronic carrier stage in patients with HAV infection. Chap-66.indd 551 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66552 VIROLOGY In an infected host whether the person will become a chronic carrier state or will be free of infection depends on the cytotoxic T-cell response. If the cytotoxic T-cell response is strong, the infection is cleared in the person but if the response is inade-quate, the person becomes a chronic carrier. During the chronic stage, the HBV DNA is present in epi- some in the cytoplasm of persistently infected cells, and in some cells the viral DNA is integrated with cellular DNA. Chronic carrier state is more likely to occur when infection occurs in a newborn than in adult. It has been observed that approximately 90% of the infected neonates become chronic carriers. Approximately 20% of HBsAg carriers, nearly 1% of all adult patients infected with HBV, and high percentage of neonates infected with the virus progress to develop hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis. The hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be the result of persistent cellular regeneration that tends to replace the dead hepatocytes. Also it is suggested that the inte-gration of HBV DNA with hepatocytes DNA could activate a cellular oncogene, resulting in loss of control of the growth of hepatocytes. However, the HBV genome has no oncogene which can be responsible directly for causing hepatocellular carcinoma. Host immunity Hepatitis B virus natural infection induces a lifelong immunity. The immunity is primarily mediated by humoral antibodies against HBsAg. Antibodies to HBsAg are protective. These antibodies bind to surface antigens or with the virus and prevent it from interaction with receptors on the hepatocytes. These antibodies appear to neutralize the infectivity of HBV. But the antibodies against core antigen HBcAg are not protec-tive because the antibodies cannot act with HBcAg present inside the cells. Clinical Syndromes Hepatitis B virus is one of the most important causes of acute and chronic hepatitis. The clinical manifestations vary from subclinical hepatitis to symptomatic and icteric hepatitis. The incubation period varies from 6 weeks to 6 months. The clinical manifestations of HBV infection depend on (a) age of infection, (b) immune status of the host, and (c) the level of HBV. Acute hepatitis B virus infection The prodromal or preicteric phase is characterized by gradual onset of anorexia, malaise, and fatigue. During the icteric phase, the liver becomes tender with development of jaundice. Nausea, vomiting, and pruritus with passing of dark-colored urine are the symptoms noted in this stage. Clinical manifesta-tions of acute hepatitis B are similar to that of hepatitis A but with the difference that the symptoms tend to be more severe and life-threatening with HBV infection. The clinical disease associated with acute HBV infection may range from mild disease to a disease as severe as fulminant hepatitis occurring in less than 1% of the patients. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection Chronic HBV infection is one of the major complications of HBV infection. The risk of chronic infection is also higher in those infected at birth (90%) and in patients who are immuno-compromised. Only 5-10% of older children or adults progress to develop chronic infection.Complications of Hepatitis B virus infection: Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the long-term but rare complica-tions of hepatitis B. Perinatal transmission or infection in children is associated with few or no symptoms, but infection has a high risk of becoming chronic. Fulminant hepatic failure is another major complication of HBV infection. This condition occurs in approximately 0.5-1% of HBV-infected patients. The condition progresses to fulminant hepatic failure with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. The case fatality rate of these patients is very high nearing 80%. Patients with chronic HBV infection have a very high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. The cancer appears to be due to repeated episodes of chronic inflammation and cellu-lar regeneration. The cancer that develops an average of 25-30 years after initial infection is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in areas where HBV is endemic. Glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa, varieties of skin manifestations, cardiopulmonary manifestations, and joint and neurologic manifestations are other important complica-tions of HBV infection. Epidemiology Hepatitis B is a major cause of infectious hepatitis worldwide. Geographical distribution Hepatitis B virus is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Nearly, one-third of the world population is believed to be infected with HBV. More than 10% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa and in East Asia are infected with HBV. Approximately, 5-10 lakh persons die annually from HBV-related liver disease. An estimated 250,000 persons die from chronic HBV infection every year in the world. Estimates suggest that 400-500 million people worldwide are HBV carriers. The HBV carrier rate varies from 1% to 20% worldwide. This variation is due to difference in the age of infection and in the mode of transmission. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Individuals with chronic HBV infection are the major reservoir of HBV infections. These people with HBeAg in their serum tend to have high viral titers and thus greater infectivity. Hepatitis B virus is present at a high level in serum. The virions are also present at very low levels in semen, vaginal mucosa, saliva, and tears, and all are infectious. The virus is not detected in urine, stool, or sweat; hence these specimens are not infectious. The hepatitis B virus can be transmitted in the following ways:Perinatal transmission: This is the major route of transmis- sion of the virus worldwide. The transmission occurs from Chap-66.indd 552 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66HEPATITIS VIRUSES 553 infected mother to child due to contact with mother's infected blood during the time of delivery as opposed to transplacental passage of the virus. Although HBV is found in breast milk, the role of breast-feeding in transmission is unclear.Parenteral transmission: This transmission occurs due to transfusion of HBV-infected blood and blood products. This was one of the important modes of transmission before 1970s, but with the starting of screening of blood donors for HBsAg, the rate of blood transfusion associated HBV infection has reduced considerably in India and other parts of the world. Patients with hemophilia, renal dialysis, and those receiving organ transplantation and intravenous drug users remain at increased risk of infection. The risk of acquiring HBV among health workers after needle stick injury from infected individu-als is estimated to be as high as 5%.Sexual transmission of HBV: Hepatitis B virus is transmitted sexually more easily than Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Hepatitis D virus (HDV). The infection is associated with vaginal inter-course, genital rectal intercourse, and nongenital intercourse. However, the HBV is not transmitted by hugging and kissing or by sharing towels, eating utensils, or food. Health workers with exposure to infected blood or body fluids, heterosexual persons with multiple partners, household contact, or sexual partners of HBV carriers are other groups at risk. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis plays an important role to confirm the HBV etiology of hepatitis. Specimen Serum is an important specimen because definitive diagnosis of HBV depends on serological testing for HBV infections. Serodiagnosis Diagnosis of acute infection is made by demonstration of HBsAg as well as HBeAg in the serum. Both HBsAg and HBeAg are the important serum markers of acute HBV. They indicate viral replication. When viral replication slows, HBeAg disappears and anti-HBeAg is detected. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) produced may persist for many years. This is followed by demonstration of IgM antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb). Key Points HBsAg: The antigen appears in blood during incubation period and is detectable in most patients during prodrome and acute phase of the disease. Persistent presence of HBsAg in blood for at least 6 months indicates the carrier state and also indicates the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. It is not detect-able in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.HBsAb: HBsAb is a protective antibody that neutralizes the virus and is usually not detectable during the acute disease since it forms immune complex with HBsAg because it is bound to the large amount of HBsAg present in blood. It is also not detectable in the chronic carrier stage.HBcAb: Demonstration of HBcAb is useful to confirm the diagnosis of HBV infection. Total HBcAb including IgM and IgG antibodies indicates exposure to the virus and viral replication. The HBcAb appears shortly after HBsAg in acute disease and persists for life. Detection of IgM HBcAb is diagnostic of acute HBV infection during window phase. The HBcAb are present in individuals with acute infection, chronic infections, and also in those who have recovered from acute infection. Therefore, the presence of HBcAb IgG does not differentiate between acute and chronic infection. HBcAg is not detectable in the serum, but can be demonstrated in the liver cells by immunofluorescence.HBeAg: HBeAg is present in the blood during the incubation and also during the prodrome and early acute disease. This is also present in certain chronic carriers. The presence of HBeAg indicates a high likelihood of infectivity and transmissibility. Chronic replication of HBV is characterized by the presence of circulating HBsAg, HBeAg usually with HBcAg. Both HBsAg and IgG antibodies to HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBeAg appear during the stage of convalescence. In essence, hepatitis B serology is useful to describe the course and nature of the disease. Acute and chronic HBV infection can be differentiated by the presence of HBsAg and HBeAg in the serum and distribution pattern of the antibodies to the indivi duals' HBV antigen (Fig. 66-5). Interpretation of common serological markers in HBV infection is summarized in Table 66-3. Molecular Diagnosis Hepatitis B virus DNA and DNA polymerase activity are detect-able during the incubation period and early in the disease. HBV DNA levels are typically low or absent in inactive carriers. HBV DNA levels are higher in patients with chronic hepatitis and are associated with increased infectivity. The detection of viral DNA in the serum indicates acute infection. HBV PCR for demonstration of HBV DNA is highly valuable to monitor the treatment of chronic HBV infection with antiviral therapy. This is also useful to identify HBV as the cause of liver infection in HBsAg-negative patients. Other tests These tests include elevation of ALT and AST. High levels are found in acute hepatitis (1000-2000 IU/mL). Estimation of serum bilirubin indicates the intensity of jaundice. Treatment No specific antiviral treatment is available for patients with acute HBV infection. Supportive and symptomatic care continues to Chap-66.indd 553 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66554 VIROLOGY be the mainstay of therapy for most of the patients. Therapy is recommended for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Interferon and nucleoside analogs, such as lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine are the antiviral drugs used widely. These antivi-ral drugs achieve viral suppression as demonstrated by loss of HBeAg in serum and suppression of HBV DNA.Interferons: Interferon-alpha (IFN-/H9251) has been the mainstay in treatment of chronic hepatitis B since its introduction in mid-1980s. Interferon acts by immunomodulation and pre-vents progression of acute hepatitis to chronic stage. It also promotes more rapid resolution of viremia and normalization of serum aminotransferase levels.Nucleoside analogs: These block the replication of viruses by directly blocking the replication of HBV. These nucleoside analogs are highly effective against HBV, and are bioavailable and extremely well targeted. However, neither interferon nor nucleoside analogs cure HBV infection. The goal of antiviral therapy is only to reduce morbidity due to HBV and to prevent complications. Prevention and Control Hepatitis B infection can be prevented by the use of either vaccine or hyperimmunoglobulin or both.Vaccines Hepatitis B infection is one of the major diseases of humans that can be prevented with vaccination. Plasma-derived and recombinant DNA HBV vaccines are the two types of vaccines that use HBsAg to stimulate the production of anti-HBs in noninfected individuals. The vaccines are highly effective with more than 95% of seroconversion. The vaccine for adults is recommended at 0, 1, and 6 months and for infants at the time of birth, at 1-2 months, and at 6-18 months. The vaccine is indicated for all infants and for all people who are at high risk of infection. The high-risk group includes the people who are frequently exposed to blood and blood products, patients receiving multiple transfusion or dialysis, patients suffer-ing from sexually transmitted disease, and intravenous drug users. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) is used for passive immu-nization of patients after or just before the exposure. This immunoglobulin is derived from human plasma and contains high titer of HBsAb. It is prepared from plasma from patients Viral markers HBsAg infection; common indication that the infectionhas become chronicHBeAg + ++++ + FIG. 66-5. Serum hepatitis infection.

Passive immunization with HBIg is recommended for: people who have a history of recent exposure to patient(s) infected with HBV, a household contact with acutely infected patient, sexual contact with an acutely infected patient, and infants born to HBsAg-positive mother. Screening of blood and blood products for HBsAg is important to prevent transfusion-related HBsAg. Hepatitis C Virus Hepatitis C virus is a flavivirus with an RNA genome and is the most important cause of parenteral non-A, non-B hepa-titis (NANBH) worldwide. Prior to identification of the virus, it was known as NANBH to differentiate it from viral causes of nonalcoholic hepatitis. Most patients infected with HCV have chronic liver disease, which progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Properties of the Virus Morphology Hepatitis C virus is the only member of the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae of RNA-containing virus. HCV appears to be closely related to hepatitis D and dengue and yellow fever virus. It resembles flavivirus in structure and organization, and hence has been classified as a new genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae. Hepatitis C virus shows following morpho-logical feartures: It is a spherical, enveloped, 9.4 kb, single-stranded RNA virus with a diameter of 55 nm. The genome is approximately 9500 base pairs that encode 10 structural and regulatory proteins. Structural proteins include the core and two envelope proteins, namely, E1 and E2. These two envelope proteins undergo variation dur-ing infection due to hypervariable regions within their genes. The viruses are ether sensitive and acid sensitive. Viral replication These viruses like other flaviviruses replicate in the endoplas-mic reticulum of hepatocytes. Antigenic and genomic properties Hepatitis C virus shows a considerable degree of genomic variations. There are six major genotypes (genotypes 1-6) and numerous subtypes which differ in their worldwide distribu-tion. Molecular differences between these genotypes are rela-tively large with as little as 55% genetic sequence homology and more than 80 subtypes are described. This genetic variability is the main stumbling block against the effort to develop an anti-HCV vaccine.Key Points Genotype 1 is the main HCV genotype prevalent worldwide and accounts for 40-80% of all isolates. It is associated with more severe liver diseases and high risk of hepatocel-lular carcinoma. HCV genotype 1, particularly 1b as well as genotypes 2 and 3, are usually less responsive to interferon therapy than other HCV genotypes. Genotypes 2 and 3 are also found globally, but to a lesser extent. Pathogenesis and Immunity The ability of HCV to remain cell associated and prevent host cell death is the main determinant of viral pathogenicity, which causes persistent infection in the liver. Presence of closely related but heterogeneous population of virus genome is one of the important factors responsible for persistence of HCV infection in the liver. Pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus infections Hepatocytes and possibly B lymphocytes are the natural targets of HCV. Results of recent studies show that at least 50% of hepatocytes may be infected with HCV in patients with chronic hepatitis. In most infected people, viremia persists and is asso-ciated with a variable degree of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Chronics hepatitis is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration either within the portal tract or in the liver lobule and portal and periportal fibrosis. Portal inflammation, interphase hepatitis, and lobular necrosis are the main histopathological features of chronic hepatitis caused by HCV. Host immunity Immunity to HCV may not be lifelong, and serum antibodies to HCV are usually protective. Cell-mediated immunity, mainly cytotoxic T lymphocytes, contributes primarily to liver inflam-mation and ultimately to tissue necrosis. Clinical Syndromes Hepatitis C virus can cause: (a) acute HCV infection, (b) chronic HCV infection, and (c) cirrhosis and other complica-tions induced by hepatitis. The incubation period of hepatitis C varies from 15 to 60 days with an average period of approxi-mately 8 weeks. Acute HCV infection Most patients with acute HCV infections are symptomatic and do not develop any jaundice. The symptoms of acute HCV infection tend to be mild and may appear similar to those of HBV infections. In symptomatic cases, jaundice occurs in less than 25% of acutely infected patients, whereas hepatomegaly is seen in one-third of cases. But most of the cases (80%) are asymptomatic and do not develop any jaundice. Chap-66.indd 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66556 VIROLOGY Chronic HCV infection Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide. Most patients with chronic hepatitis are asymptomatic and may have nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue or malaise in the absence of hepatic synthesis dysfunction. Cirrhosis and other complications induced by hepatitis C Hepatitis C virus is now a leading cause of hepatitis and cirrhosis. An estimated 20% of patients with chronic hepatitis progress to cirrhosis. This process may take an average of 20 years after initial infection worldwide. Patients with this condition have a secondary risk of liver failure, portal hyper tension, and other complications. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most important complications in 1-5% of patients with underlying cirrhosis. This condition usually develops after 30 years in patients who are chronically infected and have cirrhosis. The increased total number of deaths due to HCV-related complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, has been reported from many countries. Epidemiology Hepatitis C is prevalent worldwide. Geographical distribution More than 3% of world's population is infected with HCV. Worldwide 170 million people are estimated to be infected with HCV. It is the most important cause of parenteral NANBH worldwide. The prevalence rates are reported to be as high as 22% in Egypt due to use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy. The prevalence rates in healthy blood donors are also equally high. Hepatitis C virus is highly prevalent in central Europe, Middle East, Spain, Italy, and Japan. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Hepatitis C is exclusively a human disease. Patients who are infected with the virus are the important reservoir of infection. Blood or blood products and also organs of infected patients are the major sources of infection. Hepatitis C can be transmitted by following methods:Blood transfusion: Blood transfusion is the most important route of transmission of HCV. The current risk of transfusion-derived HCV is estimated to be one case in every 100,000 units transfused.Parenteral transmission: HCV is transmitted parenterally (a) through transfusion of infected blood or blood products, (b) transplantation of organs from infected donors, and ( c) also by sharing of contaminated needles among intravenous drug users. The use of intravenous drugs is most important risk factor responsible for around 50% of both acute and chronic infections.Sexual transmission: Sexual transmission is believed to be responsible for approximately 20% of cases of hepatitis C. The presence of coexisting sexually transmitted disease, such as HIV, appears to increase the risk of transmission.Perinatal transmission: Perinatal transmission is possible and is observed in fewer than 5% of children born to HCV-infected mothers. The risk of perinatal transmission of HCV is higher in children born to mothers who are coinfected with HCV and HIV.Other methods of transmission: Hemodialysis, tattooing, body piercing, and acupuncture with unsterile equipments are other, but less frequent, means of transmission of HCV. Needle stick injury among healthcare workers who are exposed to infected blood accounts for nearly 4% of new infections. The possibility of acquiring HCV after needle stick injury involving an infected patient appears to range from 0% to 7%. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis is most important to establish the spe-cific diagnosis of hepatitis caused by HCV. Serodiagnosis Hepatitis C infection can be confirmed by employing serologi-cal tests to detect antibodies to HCV. Antibodies are directed against core envelope and NS3 and NS4 proteins and tend to be relatively low in titer. Acute HCV antibodies are usually demonstrated in acute infections 6-8 weeks after initial infec-tion. Then antibodies that are produced persist throughout life in chronic infection. ELISAs, including second- and third-generation ELISAs, are useful for screening of serum for anti-HCV antibodies. These assays are highly specific but cannot differentiate acute infec-tion from chronic infection. The ELISA which employs anti-bodies against core proteins and nonstructural proteins 3, 4, and 5 is the most recent third-generation enzyme immunoas-say (EIA). The test can detect antibodies in the serum 8 weeks after the onset of infection. Recombinant immunoblot assay using recombinant HCV antigen is a highly specific test to detect HCV infection. This test, which is more specific than the ELISA, has been used to confirm positive ELISA results. Molecular Diagnosis PCR and branched DNA assays are being used to detect HCV RNA in the serum. HCV RNA testing is the most specific test for HCV infection and useful in diagnosing acute HCV infections before antibodies are developed. This is also helpful to (a) assess the HCV genotype, (b) to confirm false-positive cases, such as autoimmune hepatitis, and (c) to predict the response to interferon therapy. Hepatitis C virus genotyping is a recent method, which is frequently helpful for predicting the likelihood of response and duration of treatment. The genotyping is performed either by direct sequence analysis or restriction fragment length polymorphism. Liver biopsy is the most accurate method to evaluate the extent of HCV-related liver disease. It is usually recom-mended for all patients before the start of antiviral therapy. However, it is generally not used to diagnose HCV.Biopsy Chap-66.indd 556 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66HEPATITIS VIRUSES 557 Treatment A combination therapy of pegylated interferon and antiviral agent ribavirin is the current option of treatment for patients with chronic HCV infections. Other therapeutic options include the use of protease inhibitors, ribozymes, and viral vaccines. Prevention and Control No vaccine against HCV is available. Immunoglobulin is not useful in preventing transmission and, in fact, administration of immunoglobulin has been associated with HCV. Trans-mission of HCV can be prevented by screening and preventing donation of blood, organs, or semen from HCV-positive donors. Differentiating features of HAV, HBV, and HCV are summarized in Table 66-4. Hepatitis D Virus Hepatitis D virus is the smallest of known human pathogens that causes infections in humans. It is an RNA virus, which is structur-ally unrelated to hepatitis A, B, or C virus. Hepatitis D virus is unique in being an incomplete virus and requires the presence of HBV to replicate and infect other hepatocytes. Hence, HDV infec-tion occurs only in those patients who suffer from HBV infection. Hepatitis D virus was first reported by Rizzetho and col- leagues in Italy in 1977. They demonstrated the viral antigen in nuclei of hepatocytes of patients infected with HBV and suggested it to be a new hepatotropic virus delta, or HDV. Hepatitis D virus is a spherical, enveloped virus measuring 85 nm in diameter. It contains a single-stranded negative-sense 1.7 kb RNA. In blood, HDV or delta agent contains delta Ag (HDAg) surrounded by HBsAg envelope. HBsAg is required for HDV replication, but it may be suppressed to undetect-able levels with active HDV replication. The single-stranded RNA is circular and is surrounded by delta-antigen core, which in turn is surrounded by an envelope which contains HBsAg. Delta antigen may occur in two sizes\u2014small (24 kDa) or large (26 kDa). Delta antigen is the only protein coded for HDV RNA, and it is distinct from antigenic determinants of HBV. Key Points Patient may acquire HDV infection in two ways\u2014by coinfection or superinfection. Since both HDV and HBV are transmitted by the same route, a person can be coinfected with HBV and delta agent at the same time. A patient with chronic HBV infection may also be superin-fected with delta agent.Feature Hepatitis A Hepatitis B Hepatitis C VirusDiameter 27 nm 42 nm 50-60 nm Genome RNA DNA Mode of infection Feco-oral Parenteral Parenteral ImmunityHomologous Yes Yes No Heterologous No No No Duration of immunity Probably lifetime Probably lifetime - Clinical featuresIncubation period (days) 10-50 (short) 50-180 (long) 15-160 (long) Onset Acute Insidious Insidious Fever (/H1102238/H11034C) Common Less common Less common Chronicity Rare 5-10% 70-90% Mortality rate (icteric cases) /H110210.5% /H110211-2% 0.5-1% Age incidence Children, young adults 15-29 years, babies Adults Seasonal incidence Peak in autumn Throughout the year Throughout the year Laboratory featuresHBsAg Absent Present Absent IgM levels Elevated Normal to slightly elevated Normal to slightly elevated Duration of amino transferase levels 1-3 weeks 1-6/H11001 months 1-6/H11001 months Virus in feces Present early Absent Absent Carrier state in blood Up to 8 months Up to 5 years \u2014 Association with hepatocellular carcinoma No Low HighTABLE 66-4 Differentiating features of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses Chap-66.indd 557 5/14/2012 1:02:11 PMSection IV Chapter 66558 VIROLOGY Hepatitis D virus causes a more rapid and severe disease with rapid progression in HBV carriers superinfected with delta and HBV. Delta agent replicates in the liver, causing liver damage and cytotoxicity. Chronic HBV carriers superinfected with HDV usually also develop chronic HDV infection. Chronic coinfection often leads to a rapidly progressive subacute or chronic hepatitis, resulting in more rapid progression to cir-rhosis. Delta agent causes damage to liver cells as a result of direct cytopathic effect in combination with underlying immu-nopathology of HBV disease. Hepatitis D virus causes an acute and chronic inflammatory disease of liver. Although HDV can replicate independently within the hepatocytes, it requires HBsAg for its propagation. Death of hepatocytes in the liver may occur as a result of direct cytotoxic effect of HDV or through a host-mediated immune response. Hepatitis D virus is distributed worldwide. It is believed to infect approximately 15 million (5%) of world's 300 million HBsAg carriers. The highest prevalence of HDV has been reported in Italy, North Africa, Middle East, West Africa, and central Asia including China, Japan, Taiwan, and Myanmar. The infection is most common among adults and children. It is observed more commonly among patients with history of intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D virus, like hepatitis B virus, is a blood pathogen and is transmitted mostly by blood and vaginal secretions. It is most commonly transmitted by nonpercutaneous routes, especially by close intimate contact in endemic areas of Mediterranean countries. Infection appears to be more commonly transmitted through contaminated blood and blood products in nonendemic areas of northern Europe and North America. Sharing of contaminated needles in intravenous drug users is believed to be the most common method of transmitting HDV. The sexual and perinatal transmission of HDV is also described. Intravenous drug use and multiple blood transfu-sions are the important risk factors for parenteral transmission of the disease. The incubation period varies from 21 to 45 days but may be shorter in cases of superinfection. The clinical course of disease caused by HDV is varied and ranges from acute self-limited infection to acute fulminant liver failure. Clinically, HDV infec-tion is indistinguishable from other forms of viral hepatitis. Patients coinfected with HBV and HDV show a more severe course of the disease than those infected with HBV alone. Complete clinical recovery and clearance of HBV and HDV coinfection is the most common outcome. Nearly 1% of the patients with coinfections progress to develop fulminant hepatitis resulting in more rapid progres-sion to cirrhosis. Laboratory diagnosis of HDV infection is usually carried out by serological as well as molecular tests: ELISA for HDV antigen is usually positive in 20% of patients. IgM ELISA for demonstration of anti-HDV IgM is positive in early stage of infection, whereas IgG ELISA for anti-HDV IgG is positive during later course of infection. Serum antibodies against HDAg are almost exclusively associated with chronic HDV infection. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method (90%) for detection of HDV RNA in blood in the stage of coinfection. In superinfections, high level of both IgM and IgG anti-bodies as well as high level of HDAg and HDV RNA is demonstrated. No specific therapy is available for treatment of HDV infection of liver. Lamivudine and ribavirin appear to be ineffective against HBV and HDV coinfection. Antiviral therapy with interferon is also ineffective in patients with chronic infections. Vaccination with HBV vaccine protects against subsequent HDV infection. HDV virus is prevented best in the patients already infected with HBV by avoiding the use of HDV-contaminated blood or blood products. Hepatitis E Virus Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the primary cause of enterically transmitted non-A non-B hepatitis virus (NANBH), most commonly seen in developing countries including India. The virus has many similarities with HAV. The virus was first observed during the electron microscopy of feces contaminated with enteric NANBH. Hepatitis E virus is currently classified in the family Calciviridae. It resembles calciviruses, such as Norwalk virus. However, the HEV genome is different from genome of other calciviruses, and analysis of the genome sequence suggests that it is more similar to rubella virus. Therefore, HEV still remains to be classified. It is a nonenveloped, spherical virus measuring 32-34 nm in diameter. The surface of the virion shows indentations and spikes. It is icosahedral. The virus contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, approximately 7.6 kb in size. The viral genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is the largest, which codes for nonstructural protein responsible for viral repli-cation. ORF2 encodes for the capsule. The function of ORF3 is not known. The virus is heat stable. The cloning of viral genome showed HEV to consist of only one serotype. In HEV infection, the IgM antibody titer appears first, which falls rapidly after infec-tion, becoming virtually undetectable within 6 months. Anti-HEV IgG, however, persist longer for more than 6 months. The IgG antibody appears to offer protection against reinfection by HEV. Hepatitis E virus usually causes an acute, self-limiting disease similar to HAV. Earlier it was mistaken for HAV due to clinical and epidemiological similarity. Hepatitis E virus infection, now, has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity, different from the infection caused by HAV. Clinically, HEV infection differs from HAV infection by causing acute disease and by the occur-rence of symptoms much later than those of HAV disease. The incubation period of HEV infection varies from 2 to 9 weeks with an average of 35 days. Hepatitis E virus causes a serious infection in pregnant women. It causes fulminant disease in pregnant women, especially in last trimester of pregnancy and has a high fatality rate of 15-20%. Encephalopathy and disseminated intravascular Chap-66.indd Chapter 66HEPATITIS VIRUSES 559 coagulation are the important causes of death. The rate of ful-minant hepatic failure in infected pregnant women is very high. Hepatitis E virus infection does not appear to cause chronic liver diseases. Infiltration of portal tract by lymphocytes and polymorpho- nuclear leukocytes, balloon hepatocytes, formation of acidophilic bodies, and intralobular necrosis of hepatocytes is the classic pathological finding of HEV infection. Hepatitis E virus is distributed worldwide. It is most commonly found in developing countries. The epidemics of HEV have been recorded in India, Pakistan, Nepal, China, Burma, North Africa, and Mexico. During 1986-1988, one such large outbreak was reported in north-east China affecting nearly 10,000 people. In India, the largest epidemic of HEV occurred in Delhi during the winter of 1955-1956, affecting more than 30,000 persons. Anti-HEV antibodies are observed in serum of as many as 60% of children in India below 5 years of age. Tropical cli-mate, poor sanitation, and poor personal hygiene all contribute to the epidemic of the disease in developing countries. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted primarily by fecal-oral route due to fecal contamination of water in endemic areas. Fecal contaminated water is the important source of infection. The reservoir of HEV is unknown, but it may be transmitted by animals. Key Points The virus is yet to be cultured. The serodiagnosis of HEV infection is carried out by Western blot and EIAs using antigenic domains from ORF2 and ORF3. Detection of anti-HEV IgM and IgG helps to differentiate acute and chronic infections. PCR is also used to detect HEV RNA in serum and stool specimen of infected patients. This test, however, is restricted to few research laboratories. Treatment of HEV infection is mainly supportive. No vaccine is available now for prevention of HEV. Administration of immunoglobulin does not prevent development of clinical disease. Hepatitis E virus infections respond poorly to treatment with serum IgG. Epidemiological features of hepati-tis viruses are summarized in Table 66-5. Hepatitis G Virus Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is similar to viruses of Flaviviridae family, which includes HCV. The flavivirus-like isolates were first demonstrated in Tamarin monkeys inoculated with blood from a surgeon with acute hepatitis in 1995. A similar virus was isolated from another patient during the same year. These viral isolates were designated GB viruses A, B, and C. A similar virus resembling GBVC (GB virus C) was isolated from a patient with chronic hepatitis in 1996. Now the virus has been designated as HGV. Hepatitis G virus is an RNA virus and its genome codes for 2900 amino acids. The virus shows 95% homology at the amino acid level with GB virus and GBVC, a previously described virus. HGV has 20% homology with HCV. Hepatitis G virus is a blood-borne virus, which is transmitted by transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products. HGV coinfection is observed in 6% of chronic HBV infection and in 10% of chronic HCV infection. Although HGV RNA has been demonstrated in patients with acute, chronic, and fulminant hepatitis, patients with multiple transfusions and hemodialy-sis, blood donors, and intravenous drug addicts, its role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis is yet to be elucidated. Therefore, whether or not HGV is actually a pathogen in humans, still remains to be clarified.Virus Mode of transmission Vaccine Immunoglobulins HAV Fecal-oral Available Useful HBV Blood, sexual, at birth Available UsefulHCV Blood, sexual Not available Not useful HDV Blood, sexual Not available Not useful HEV Fecal-oral Not available Not usefulTABLE 66-5Epidemiological features of hepatitis viruses A 25-year-old resident in surgery was admitted to the hospital with jaundice, nausea, and vomiting.

His serum tested for HAV IgM was negative, HAV IgG positive, HBsAg negative, HBsAb positive, HBcAb negative, and HCV-antibody positive. What is the possible hepatitis virus responsible for the condition? What is the most likely method of acquiring this infection? What are the complications of this infection? How can you prevent this infection?CASE STUDY Chap-66.indd 559 positive-stranded, spherical RNA viruses showing a characteristic morphology and unusual mode of replication. The presence of an unusual enzyme\u2014the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase, giving the virus its name (retro meaning reverse)\u2014is the unique feature of the viruses belonging to the family Retroviridae. The enzyme reverse transcriptase prepares a DNA copy of the retroviral RNA genome\u2014initially RNA-DNA hybrid and subsequently forms double-stranded DNA. The DNA copy of the viral genome is known as provirus. The provirus is then integrated into the host cell DNA to become a cellular gene for the rest of the life of the cell. This is in contrast to the classical transcription of the genetic information from DNA to RNA and then to proteins. Baltimore and Tenin were the first to demonstrate that the retroviruses encode an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and replicate through a DNA intermediate. Retroviruses Classification All oncogenic RNA viruses are classified in the family Retroviridae; but all retroviruses are not oncogenic. The family Retroviridae, depending on (a ) the diseases they cause, (b ) tissue tropism and host range, (c ) morphology of virions, and (d ) genetic complexity are classified into three subfamilies, as follows:Oncovirinae: The Oncovirinae or oncoviruses include only the retroviruses that can transform target cells. The viruses depending on their core and capsid, as demonstrated in electron microscopy, are classified further into types A, B, C, or D. These include human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, and HTLV-4).Lentivirinae: The lentivirinae or lentiviruses are slow (lent: slow) viruses associated with neurological and immunosup-pressive diseases in humans as well as in animals. These include human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2), Visna virus of sheep, and caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus of consist of spumaviruses, which contain nononcogenic \"foamy viruses\" (spuma: foam). These viruses are associated with asymptomatic infection in animals but are not associated with any human disease. Retroviruses belonging to these subfamilies associated with human diseases are summa-rized in Table 67-1. The idea that cancer could be caused by a virus was first hypothesized by Peyton Rous (1911), when he transmitted solid tumors (sarcomas) of chicken by transplanting tissue. The belief that retroviruses could be associated with human leukemia was not in favor till discovery of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) in 1970s. This discovery led to increased interest in a potential human lymphotropic virus. In 1960s, Tenin was the first to predict that retroviruses could replicate their RNA genome, by transcribing it into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This observation was supported by results of a study reported separately by David Baltimore. The discovery of reverse transcriptase was revolu-tionary, because it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology that genetic information is passed in one direction from DNA to RNA and then to protein. Baltimore and Tenin were awarded the Nobel Prize for their revolutionary work, which subsequently contributed immensely to the progress and developments in molecular biology. Minna and Gazdar were the first to detect the first human leukemic retrovirus in 1979; but it was Poiesz and Gallo in 1980 who conclusively demonstrated the infectivity, antibody response, and evidence of provirus from the first human T-cell lymphotropic virus, or HTLV-1, isolated from a patient with a cutaneous T-cell malignancy. Subsequently, many human cancers caused by HTLV-1 were reported from different parts of the world. Properties of the Virus Morphology The retroviruses are enveloped, mostly spherical viruses that measure 80-120 nm in size. The envelope of the virus is acquired by budding from the plasma membrane and contains viral glycoprotein. The virus consists of two identical copies of Retroviruses Virus Disease HTLV-1, HTLV-2 Chapter 67RETROVIRUSES 561 linear, single, positive-stranded RNA genome. The virus also contains the cellular transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and the enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase. The tRNAs are used as primers for the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The presence of the enzyme reverse transcriptase\u2014an unusual enzyme, which is RNA-dependent DNA polymerase\u2014is the characteristic feature of retroviruses. The enzyme prepares a copy from RNA to DNA, unlike the classical transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA. Reverse transcriptase prepares a DNA copy of the retroviral RNA genome, which is initially an RNA-DNA hybrid but later forms a double-stranded DNA provirus. Infection with onco-genic retroviruses leads to integration of the provirus randomly with the host chromosome, and it becomes a cellular gene for the rest of the life of the cell. All the proteins of retroviruses are translated from provirus. The genome of the simple retroviruses consists of three major genes that encode glycoproteins of the virus. These are gag, pol, and env genes. The gag gene encodes for group- specific antigens, capsid proteins; pol gene for enzymes polymerase, and env gene for envelope glycopro-teins. Proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein encoded by the env gene leads to production of the viral glycoproteins. For example, the gp160 of HIV is cleaved into gp41 and gp120, is into gp46 and gp21. Long terminal protein repeat sequences are present at the end of the genome. The long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence contains promoters, enhancers, and other gene sequences essential for binding different cellular transcription factors. Transcription of the genome is regulated by the interaction of the host transcription factors with promoter and enhancer elements in the LTR of the genome. The complex retroviruses, HTLV and the lentiviruses includ- ing HIV consist of several accessory genes, such as tat , rev, nef, vif, vpu for HIV. These genes also encode several regulatory proteins that require more complex transcriptional processing than the simple retroviruses. Various retrovirus genes and their functions are summarized in Table 67-2. Antigenic properties Two types of antigens are present in retroviruses. These are group-specific nucleoprotein antigen in the virion core and type-specific glycoprotein antigen in the envelope. Other properties Retroviruses are heat labile, readily destroyed on exposure to heat at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The viruses are also readily inacti-vated on treatment with mild acids, ether, and formalin. They are stable on storage at 30\u00b0C. Pathogenesis and Immunity Provirus and oncogenes are two key components that play very important role in the pathogenesis of tumors induced by viruses. In provirus model , the gene enters the cell at the time of infection by tumor virus. In oncogene model, the genes for malignancy are already present in all cells of the body by virtue of being present in the sperm and egg. The oncogenic viruses have the ability to transform the cells in cultures and induce tumors in animals. The retroviruses may induce tumors by either of the two mechanisms: ( a) by induc- ing or altering the expression of a preexisting cellular gene or (b) by introducing a new transforming gene ( oncogene) into the cellular genome. Oncogenes Oncogenes may be of two types: viral oncogenes and cellular oncogenes.Viral oncogenes: Viral oncogenes are the genes that encode proteins that induce transformation of normal cells into malig-nant cells. The viral oncogenes are usually of host cell origin. These oncogenes encode proteins that promote cell growth. The proteins encoded by oncogenes perform several functions. For example, the ras oncogene encodes a G protein that acts on the cell membrane, whereas myc oncogene encodes a tran- scription factor that acts on nucleus by binding to DNA. Viral oncogenes initiate inappropriate cell growth and malignant transformation, but are not required for the replication of viruses. Viral oncogenes of DNA and RNA viruses are summa-rized in Table 67-3.Virus Gene Function Retroviruses gag Group-specific and cellular genes HIV-1 tat Transactivation of viral and cellular genes HTLV rex Regulation of RNA splicing and promotion of export to cytoplasm HIV-1 rev Regulation of RNA splicing and promotion of export to cytoplasm HIV-1 nef Alteration of cell activation signals and progression to AIDS HIV-1 vif Viral infectivity and promotion of assembly HIV-1 vpu Facilitation of release of virus and decrease of cell surface CD4 HIV-1 vpr (vpx) Transport of complementary DNA to nucleus and arrest of cell growth Retroviruses LTR Promoter, enhancer elements HTLV, IV Chapter 67562 VIROLOGY Cellular oncogenes: Genes resembling viral oncogenes may be of two types: cellular oncogenes and proto-oncogenes. The oncogenes isolated from cancer cells are known as cellular oncogenes (c-onc), while similar genes found in normal cells are called proto-oncogenes. Key Points More than 20 cellular oncogenes have been identified till date. Many cells contain several different cellular onco-genes. Moreover, the same cellular oncogenes are found in a wide variety of diverse species, such as fruit flies, rodents, and humans. Some cellular oncogenes are expressed during normal embryonic development. The proto-oncogenes are found widely in vertebrates. These genes encode proteins essential for cell growth regulation and differentiation. It is postulated that the cellular oncogenes may serve as precursor of viral oncogenes. Both cellular oncogenes and viral oncogenes are similar, but not identical. They differ from each other by their base sequences. Moreover, cellular onco-genes consist of introns characteristic of eukaryotic genes, but viral oncogenes do not contain any of these eukaryotic genes. Transfection is the method of study of oncogenes, which can be demonstrated in mouse fibroblast cell lines, such as NIH 3T3. Foreign DNA is taken up by these cells, incorporated into their genome, and is transfected into the host cells, resulting in the formation of transforming genes. These genes have been shown to be identical with that of cellular oncogenes. Pathogenesis of retrovirus infections Retroviruses (such as HTLV or HIV) carry a fourth gene, namely, tax or tat , next to the env gene. The tax or tat is a transactivating gene that regulates the function of the viral genes. The onco-genic retroviruses may be slow transforming viruses or acute transforming viruses. The slow transforming viruses, such as chronic leukemia viruses, have a low oncogenic potency and induce malignant changes, usually only of blood cells, and that after a long latent period. They replicate normally and do not transform cultured cells. The acute transforming viruses, in contrast, are highly oncogenic. They induce malignancy in infected cells after a short latent period of weeks or months. They transform cells in culture and can cause different types of malignancies, such as sarcoma, carcinoma, and leukemia. Unlike slow transforming viruses, the acute transforming viruses are unable to replicate normally because they carry an additional gene, the viral oncogene (v-onc gene) on their genome, which replaces some of the genes necessary for replication of viruses. The v-onc gene can replicate only if coinfected with a standard helper retrovirus. Therefore, most of these acute transforming viruses are replica-tion defective viruses. Rous sarcoma virus, however, is an exception, which is replication competent. It carries the oncogene src, which can replicate normally, because it consists of all the genomes gag, pol, and env, which are essential for normal replication. Recombination between retroviral and cellular genes, gene amplification and mutations, chromosomal translocation, and promoter insertion are few of the genetic processes that appear to play important role in conversion of benign proto-oncogenes to cancer genes. Clinical Syndromes Humans HTLVs, which are described later, are the viruses that have been associated with T-cell lymphoma and leukemia. Animals Sarcoma and acute leukemia viruses: The sarcoma and acute leukemia viruses cause infection primarily in animals. They are not associated with any human infections. The avian leukosis complex virus includes a group of antigenically related viruses, which induce avian leukosis or sarcoma in fowls.Leukemia viruses: These are slow oncogenic viruses, which induce malignancies after a long latency period of even 30 years. These viruses promote cancerous growth by indirect ways as compared to the oncogene-encoded acute leukemia or sar-coma viruses. These viruses specifically have a tax gene, which is a transcriptional regulator and is capable of activating LTR sequences that enhance expression of cellular growth genes. This leads to uncontrolled cell growth, which may transform the cells neoplastically or promote other genetic changes over a long period of time.Characteristic DNA virus RNA virus Prototype virus SV40 virus Rous sarcoma virus Name of gene Early-region A gene src gene Name of protein T antigen Src protein Location of protein Primarily nuclear, but some in plasma membrane Plasma membrane Function of protein Protein kinase, ATPase activity, binding to DNA, and stimulation of DNA synthesisProtein kinase that phosphorylates tyrosine Required for viral replication Yes No Required for cell transformation Yes YesTABLE 67-3 Viral oncongenes of DNA and RNA viruses Chap-67.indd IV Chapter 67RETROVIRUSES 563 Other viruses: Murine leukosis viruses, which consist of several strains of murine leukemia and sarcoma viruses, are associated with infections in mice. Mammary tumor virus of mice is associ-ated with mammary cancer only in certain susceptible strains of mice having a high natural incidence of breast cancer. Leukosis sarcoma viruses of other animals consist of a large number of viruses that have been associated with leukosis and sarcoma in cat, hamster, rat, guinea pig, and monkey. Epidemiology Retroviruses are documented from different host species worldwide. Retroviruses show host specificity, the specificity being determined mainly by the presence of viral receptors on the host cell surfaces. Retroviruses can be transmitted in two ways: exogenous and endogenous. trans-mitted horizontally. Endogenous retroviruses are transmitted vertically from parents to offspring, and the process is mediated by the provirus integrated with germ line cell genome. This provirus behaves like a cellular gene and is under regulatory control of the host cell. Laboratory Diagnosis Most of the endogenous retroviral infection can be detected by molecular techniques, such as nucleic acid hybridization or by activation after exposure to radiation or chemicals. Treatment No specific treatment is available for the management of retroviral infections. Human T-Lymphotropic Viruses HTLV-1 is one of the six distinct retroviruses known to infect human lymphocytes, others being HTLV-2, HTLV-3, HTLV-4, HIV-1, and HIV-2. HTLV and HIV are two important members of the retrovirus family. Both the viruses are the enveloped viruses. Both have enzyme reverse transcriptase in the virion and two copies of a single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA genome. The HIV virus is described in Chapter 68. Properties of the Virus Morphology HTLV-1 shows following features: It is an enveloped, spherical virus measuring 100 nm in diameter. The virus consists of a single-stranded RNA with diploid genome, which has the property to replicate through DNA intermediary and is able to integrate into host T cell genome as a provirus. The genome contains LTRs, which encode for a large number of polyproteins processed by virally encoded protease and cellular protease into functional peptides. The gene px encodes for Tax and Rex proteins, which regulate gene expression in the virus. The gag gene encodes structural proteins of matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid; pol gene encodes several enzymes, such as polymerase, is morphologically similar to HIV except that it has a centrally located nucleocapsid core in a mature virion. HTLV also differs from HIV by having a unique genome. The genome has the same gag-pol-env motif with LTR sequences as those of HIV, but it differs from HIV by having a fourth sequence (xp), which participates in transcription. Viral replication The HTLV has two important genes tax and rex, which regulate viral replication. The main function of tax gene is transactiva- tion of viral and cellular genes, and that of rex gene is regulation of RNA splicing and promotion of export to cytoplasm.Tax gene: It is a transcriptional activator, which enhances tran- scription of the viral genome from the promoter gene sequences in the LTR. It also activates other genes IL-3, GM-CSF granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor), and the receptor for IL-2. Activation of this gene promotes the growth of infected T cells.Rex gene: It encodes two proteins that bind to structure on the viral mRNA and thereby prevent splicing and promote mRNA transport to the cytoplasm. Later during the course of infec-tion, the rex gene selectively enhances expression of the singly sliced structural genes, which are required in large quantities. HTLV primarily infects CD4/H11001 cells. The virus enters the cell and within the cytoplasm, reverse transcriptase of the virion synthesizes a DNA copy of the genome. The genome is then transported into the nucleus and is integrated with the cell DNA by the virally encoded integrase, resulting in an infection. The host cell RNA polymerase makes viral RNA, and transcrip-tion is upregulated by Tax protein. The latter facilitates transcription of viral genome and Rex protein modulates processing of viral pre-mRNA. The Rex protein controls the synthesis of the gag/ pol mRNA, the env mRNA, and their subsequent transport to the cytoplasm, where they are translated into structural viral pro-teins. Virion genome RNA is also synthesized and transported to cytoplasm. The virus-encoded protease mediates conver-sion of precursor polypeptides into functional structural proteins. The nucleocapsid of the virion is assembled in the cytoplasm and budding takes place at the outer cell membrane. Antigenic and genomic properties Six different HTLV-1 subclasses exist. Each subtype is endemic in a particular geographical area. The oncoviruses include HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3, but only HTLV-1 has been associated with human disease. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 share as much as 50% homology. HTLVs, and IV Chapter 67564 VIROLOGY HTLV-4, have recently been described in a small number of Africans, with no particular illness. Pathogenesis and Immunity HTLV-1 is a lymphotropic virus. The HTLVs are distinguished from HIV as they cause lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas HIV causes lymphocytosis. It enters the host by sexual intercourse, breast feeding, or blood transfusion. Pathogenesis of HTLV infection After entry in humans, the virus spreads through circulation and infects the CD4 helper and DTH (delayed-type hypersensi-tivity) T cells. These T cells are most commonly present in the skin as well as in the neurons. Recent evidences show that glu-cose transporter (GLUT-1) is a supportive receptor for HTLV-1 cell entry. The ubiquitous distribution of GLUT-1 may help explain the viral tropism of HTLV-1. HTLV predominantly infects and integrates lymphocytes. Once the infection is transmitted, the tax gene (which encodes Tax protein) transactivates the cellular genes for T-cell growth factor and IL-2 and their receptors, all of which activate growth in the infected cells. The viruses in the infected cell may remain latent or may replicate slowly for many years and may also induce the clonal outgrowth of particular T-cell clones. There is a long latency period of approximately 30 years before the onset of leukemia. Although the exact mechanism of viral pathogenesis of T-cell leukemia that occurs in 3-5% of individuals is not known, in vitro studies have shown that the tax gene plays an important role. Key Points Tax gene contributes in a number of ways to activities of the cellular genes that either causes cell promotion or inhibits nucleic acid repair mechanism. The gene also inhibits normal apoptosis of lymphocytes and therefore facilitates their growth. It has also been shown that lymphocytic cells tend to accu-mulate damaged DNA and proliferate when tax gene is active. Tax protein plays a very important role in growth of virus and pathogenesis of the disease. It contributes for extensive cell proliferation. It has also been demonstrated that HTLV can spread by cell-to-cell contact without replication, but it is not clear how HTLV crosses the blood-brain barrier to cause neurological sequelae of HTLV infection. Host immunity The immune response to HTLV infection in humans is char-acteristic and depends on whether the patient develops malig-nancies or neuropathy. HTLV infection is characterized by the development of circulating antibodies within 4-8 weeks, which remain positive for the rest of the life. Paradoxically, the patients who have got high level of antibodies appear to be at a greater risk for HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). These antibodies do not confer any protective immunity in patients. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) fails to eradicate HTLV infection possibly due to ability of the virus to spread without replication, through cell-to-cell contact. The CMI through its cytotoxic T-cell lymphocytes appears to contribute to the intra-medullary degeneration of the central nervous system. On the other hand, cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte responses in patients with HTLV are depressed, which leads to increase in the number of transformed cells. Clinical Syndromes HTLV-1 is the causative leukemia Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is seen in approximately 1 in 20 persons infected by HTLV-1 over a period of 30-50 years. The condition is a malignancy of the CD4 helper T cells, which can be acute or chronic. Acute ATL comprises 55-75% of all the ATL cases. Lymphade-nopathy (both in the periphery and within the body cavities) repre-sents the classic form of ATL. Hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcemia, and lytic bone lesions are the other manifestations. Death is caused due to opportunistic infections, pulmonary complications, and sepsis. Chronic ATL is a less progressing degenerative disease that primarily affects the corticospinal tract of the thoracic spinal cord. The incubation period of HAM/TSP can be as short as 3 months when infection is transmitted by blood transfusion, but is usually 3 years. Patients with HAM/TSP may present with weakness and stiffness in lower limbs, urinary inconti-nence, and lower back pain. HTLV-associated uveitis HTLV-associated uveitis is a less frequent manifestation. The condition is associated with the presence of HTLV-infected lymphocytes in vitreous fluid of the eye. HTLV-associated infectious dermatitis HTLV-associated infectious dermatitis is a chronic and severe form of dermatitis seen during childhood. HTLV-2 has not been associated with any lymphoproliferative disease in humans. It is doubtful that HTLV types 3 and 4 cause any human disease. Epidemiology HTLV-1 infection is endemic in Japan, South America, Northern Oceania, and Tropical Africa and in the Caribbean Chap-67.indd 564 5/14/2012 1:00:45 PMSection IV Chapter 67RETROVIRUSES 565 ocean. Few foci of infection have also been documented in Asia in Philippines. HTLV-1 is transmitted from mother to child through breast milk during the act of breast feeding or during child birth. In adults, transmission is primarily through sexual contact. Apparently, a prolonged period of sexual contact is necessary for transmission of the disease. Homosexual contact, however, appears to play less important role in transmission of the disease. Blood transfusion and intravenous drug abuse are also other very important modes of transmission of HTLV-1. Laboratory Diagnosis Biopsy is useful for definitive diagnosis and classification of HTLV. The presence of convoluted nuclei, also known as cloverleaf or flower lymphocytes in the peripheral blood is typical of ATL. Provirus can also be demonstrated in these malignant cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence antibody test, and HTLV-ELISA are serological tests used in diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection. HTLV-ELISA is a frequently used test to demonstrate antibodies in the serum for diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection. The test is widely used to study seroprevalence of HTLV-1 infection in the commu-nity in the highly endemic regions of Japan, the Unites states of America, and Africa. High false positivity is a noted problem with ELISA, particularly in areas of low prevalence. Hence, all HTLV-ELISA-positive cases need to be confirmed with Western blot, immunofluorescence antibody test, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular Diagnosis PCR is useful to distinguish between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infections. It is also useful in infants who are suspected of having false-positive results due to the presence of circulat-ing maternal anti-HTLV antibodies. Treatment No specific treatment is available for the management of HTLV-1 infection. But a limited success has been obtained in chemotherapy of some patients with combination of AZT and interferon-alpha. However, no known regimen increases the survival time of the patients beyond 2 years. Relapse is common.Prevention and Control Preventive measures include health education, which should focus on: (a) avoidance of breast feeding by known infective mothers, (b) use of safe sexual practices by couples, and (c) screening of blood donors for HTLV antibodies. Properties of various re troviruses are summarized in Table 67-4. Endogenous Retroviruses Endogenous retroviruses are those retroviruses that are integrated into and become part of chromosomes in humans and animals. These proviruses are similar to those of HTLV, mouse mammary tumor virus, and other retroviruses that have been detected in humans. These viruses usually lack the ability to replicate because they are poorly transcribed or because of deletion of the insertion of termination codons. Other Oncogenic Viruses Oncogenic DNA viruses are examples of other viruses associ-ated with malignancies in humans and animals. The list of such viruses is summarized in Table 67-4. Examples Characteristics Mouse mammary tumor virus Have eccentric nucleocapsid core in immunodeficiency (HIV-1, HIV-2), virus (sheep), Caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (goats)Slow onset neurological immunosuppression; have Human foamy clinical disease Human placental virus Have retrovirus sequences that are integrated into human genomeTABLE 67-4 Properties of retroviruses A 35-year-old man, resident of an area endemic for HTLV infection, in Japan was admitted with presentation of weakness and stiffness in lower limbs, urinary incontinence, and lower back pain for a period of 3 months. The person gave a history of receiving blood transfusion nearly 2 years back. Serum was positive by HTLV-ELISA. The person was suspected to be suffering from HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. What are the other tests you will perform to confirm the diagnosis? What are the other clinical syndromes associated with HTLV-1 infection in humans? What are the countries in which HTLV-1 infection is endemic? Describe the pathogenesis (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is one of the most devastating epidemics ever recorded in the world. AIDS was first recognized in Los Angeles in 1981, when five cases of Pneumocystis carinii (now called Pneumocystis jir-ovecii) pneumonia in homosexual men and drug addicts were reported. The causative agent of AIDS was first reported by Luc Montagnier and colleagues from the Pasteur Institute, Paris, in 1983. They isolated a retrovirus from a West Asian patient with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and named it Lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). In 1984, Robert Gallo and colleagues from the National Institute of Health, USA, reported isolation of a retrovirus from patient with AIDS and called it human T cell lymphotropic virus-III (HTLV-III). The International Committee on Virus Nomenclature in 1986 gave the name human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, for the same virus. HIV-1 is first isolated virus from the cases of AIDS, and HIV-2 has been isolated from some case of AIDS from West Africa. HIV Virus Classification HIV is a Lentivirus, a sub family of Lentiviridae in the family retrovirus. This family includes the viruses known for (i) poor host immune responses, (ii) latency, (iii) persistent viremia, and (iv) infection of the central nervous system. HIV, like other ret-roviruses, are enveloped RNA viruses, characteristically pos-sessing an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase. Properties of the Virus Morphology HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus, which measures up to 120 nm in diameter (Fig. 68-1). It has a unique three-layered structure: (i) the innermost genome layer, (ii) middle cone-shaped nucleocapsid, and (iii) an outer membrane of glycopro-tein surrounded by lipoprotein envelope.Viral genome: HIV genome is most complex of human ret-roviruses. The genome is diploid and consists of two identical copies of single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. The HIV genome is most complex of human retroviruses. It contains three major genes gag, pol, and env, characteristic of all retrovi- ruses. All these genes encode for the structural proteins. The gag gene encodes for internal capsid and matrix \"core\" proteins (p15, p18, and p24). Of these three proteins, p24 is the major antigen, which is demonstrated in serum of HIV patients during the early stage of infection and persists till the appear-ance of serum antibodies. Detection of p24 antigen in serum, therefore, is of diagnostic value. The pol gene encodes for several proteins, including the enzymes reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease. The enzyme reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA by using the genome RNA as a template. The enzyme integrase inte-grates the viral DNA into the cellular DNA, and the enzyme protease cleaves various viral precursor proteins. The pol gene expresses precursor protein p160, which is cleaved into three proteins: p31, p51, The env gene codes gp160, a precursor glycoprotein that is split to form two envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which form the surface spikes and transmembrane tissue proteins, respectively. Apart from these genes, it also consists of six other regula- tory genes (tat , rev, nef, vif, and vpr) including an additional gene vpu in HIV-1 and vpx in HIV-2. Regulatory genes encode several proteins, which are essen- tial for transcription and invasion of virion into host cells. tat gene is the most important one, which encodes a protein called Tat protein that facilitates viral gene transcription. Tat protein along with other HIV-encoded regulatory pro-tein called Nef suppresses the synthesis of class I MHC Immunodeficiency Chapter 68HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 567 (major histocompatibility complex) proteins, thereby reducing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill the HIV-infected cells. The rev gene encodes another regulatory protein, which controls transport of mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. The functions of the genes are summarized in Table 68-1.Nucleocapsid: The viral genome is surrounded by a nucleo-capsid consisting of proteins. Three enzymes: (i) reverse transcriptase, (ii) integrase, and (iii) protease are located in the nucleocapsid. 1. Reverse transcriptase perf orms two important functions. First, it transcribes the RNA genome into the proviral genome. Second, it also has a ribonuclease H activity, which degrades the RNA when it is in the form of an RNA-DNA hybrid molecule. Degradation of the viral RNA genome is an essential step in the synthesis of double-stranded provi-ral DNA. 2. Integrase is other im portant enzyme, which facilitates integration of proviral DNA into the host cell DNA. 3. Protease is another enzyme, which splits precursor poly-pro teins into functional viral polypeptides. Envelope: The virus is surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope. The lipid component is derived from the host cell membrane and glycoproteins, which are virus coded. The major virus coded envelope glycoproteins are the projecting spikes on the surface and the anchoring transmembrane pedicles. The pro-jecting spikes combine with the CD4 receptors on susceptible host cells, and transmembrane pedicles cause cell fusion. Viral replication HIV replication is similar to that of other retroviruses. The virus binds to the CD4 proteins on the cell surface with the help of its gp120 envelope protein (Fig. 68-2). This protein also interacts with chemokine receptors on the cell surface. Then gp41 of the virus mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane followed by entry of the virus into the cell. CXCR4 and CCR5 are the chemokine receptors, which are very much essential for entry of HIV into CD4/H11001 cells. The T-cell-tropic strains of HIV bind to CXCR4 and the HIV CD4 receptor Helper T cells Lymphocytes Monocytes Dendritic cells HIV infected cell FIG. 68-2. Invasion by HIV. macrophage-tropic strains bind to CCR5. Once inside the cell, after uncoating, the virion RNA-dependent DNA polymerase transcribes the genome RNA into double-stranded DNA, which subsequently integrates with the host cell DNA. Integration is mediated by the viral enzyme integrase. The host cell RNA poly-merase transcribes the viral mRNA from the proviral DNA. The viral mRNA encodes several proteins, which are cleaved by many enzymes. For example, the Gag protein is cleaved by the virus-encoded protease to form the main core protein (p24), the matrix protein (p17), and several smaller proteins. The Pol protein is also cleaved by protease to produce reverse transcrip-tase, integrase, and protease. The Env protein is cleaved by a cellular protease. The immature virions containing the precursor polyproteins are assembled in the cytoplasm, and cleavage by the viral prote-ase occurs as the immature virion buds from the cell membrane, resulting in the production of mature infectious HIV. Antigenic and genomic properties HIV shows two distinct antigens: (a) group-specific antigen and (b) type-specific envelope glycoproteins.Group-specific antigen: The protein p24 is the group-specific antigen present in the core of the virus. p24 is stable and does not show variations. Serum antibodies against p24 antigen are not protective and do not neutralize infectivity of HIV. But p24 is an important serological marker for diagnosis of HIV.Type-specific envelope glycoproteins: gp120 and gp41 are the type-specific envelope glycoproteins, which are pres-ent on the surface of the virus. gp120, which protrudes from the surface, is the most important that combines with CD4 receptors as well as the chemokine receptors on surface of CD4 cells. It shows many antigenic variants due to mutations Gene Gene product Description gag p24 Nucleocapsid core protein p15 Nucleocapsid core protein p55 Precursor core protein p18 gag transcriptase 567 5/14/2012 12:59:55 PMSection IV Chapter 68568 VIROLOGY in the gene that encodes the antigen. V3 loop is the most immunogenic region of the gp120 and also shows significant antigenic variations. Antibodies against gp120 neutralize the infectivity, but the rapid emergence of gp120 variants does not confer protection against new strains; hence it is difficult to produce an effective vaccine. gp41, which is embedded in the envelope, mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane at the time of infection. HIV shows two distinct antigenic types: HIV-1 and HIV-2. The envelope antigens of both the types are different. Their core polypeptide shows some degree of cross-reactivity. HIV-2 is more closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus than to HIV-1. HIV-1 represents the original isolates from Americas, Europe, and other Western countries, whereas HIV-2 isolates are originated from Western Africa. HIV-2 is more closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus than to HIV-1. HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains based on sequence analysis of either gag or env genes have been classified into three groups: M (major/main), N (non-M, non-O/new), and O (other). The M group is the most prevalent group, which causes majority of HIV-1 infections. Group M consists of nine subtypes: A-D, F-H, J, and K; all of which have originated from Central Africa and are prevalent all over the world. Groups N and O include only some HIV-1 isolates from Central Africa, which do not belong to the group M. Other properties HIV is a thermolabile virus. It is readily inactivated at 60\u00b0C in 10 minutes and at 100\u00b0C in seconds. The virus in dried blood, at room temperature (20-25\u00b0C), may survive for up to 7 days. The virus has been isolated from various tissues even up to 16 days at autopsy of the patient infected with HIV. HIV is inactivated by treatment with 50% ethanol, 35% isopropanol, 0.5% lysol, 0.5% formaldehyde, 0.3% hydrogen peroxide, and 10% bleaching powder in 10 minutes. Bleaching powder is an effective disinfectant for use as surface decon-taminant at a concentration of 0.5%, with free chlorine 5 g/L (5000 ppm). A 2% solution of glutaraldehyde is effective for dis-infection of medical instruments. In liquid plasma or in lyophilized blood products, HIV can be inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. It is also inac-tivated at a very low pH (1) and high pH (13). Virus Isolation Cell culture HIV can be cultured by cocultivation of lymphocytes with potentially infected and uninfected mononuclear cells to pro-mote viral replication. Primary isolates of HIV grow very slowly on cell lines compared with laboratory-adopted strains. Virus growth is detected by testing the culture supernatant fluid to demonstrate p24 antigen or viral reverse transcriptase activ-ity after incubation of the culture for an average period of 7-14 days or even larger (28 days).Pathogenesis and Immunity HIV is primarily a sexually transmitted pathogen transmitted by high-risk behaviors, such as unprotected intercourse, male homosexual intercourse, and also by intravenous (IV) drug abuse. The tropism of the HIV for CD4-expressing T-cells and macrophages is the principal determinant of the pathogenicity of HIV. HIV shows tropism for all the cells expressing CD4 anti-gens on their cell surfaces. The CD4 antigens act as receptors for HIV. The virus infects helper T cells and kills them, result-ing in HIV-induced immunosuppression, leading to full-blown AIDS\u2014a key feature of the pathogenesis of HIV infection. This makes the patient most susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancerous conditions, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma. However, the virus does not directly cause any tumor, because HIV genes are not found in these tumor cells. Pathogenesis of HIV infection In the genital tract, infection with HIV begins in Langerhans cells, the dendritic cells that line the mucosa. This is followed by infection of the local CD4/H11001 helper T cells in the genital tract and by the appearance of the virus in the blood 4-11 days after infec-tion. The CD4 receptors are present on CD4 T lymphocytes and also on the cells of the macrophage lineage, such as monocytes, macrophages, and alveolar macrophages of lungs, dendritic cells of the skin, and microglial cells of the brain (Fig. 68-3). gp120 protein is the principal determinant of pathogenicity of HIV. The Vy region of the gp120 determines cellular tropism of the virus. After HIV enters the host, gp120 binds selectively to the CD4 cell surface receptors and CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors expressed on macrophage lineage cells. After gp120 binds to the receptor, the associated gp41 protein initiates the cell membrane fusion. After fusion with the host cell membrane, the virus loses its envelope and reverse transcription of RNA to DNA occurs. The reverse transcrip-tase ribonuclease mediates transcription of the RNA into double-stranded DNA provirus. The provirus is integrated into the genome of the infected cell causing latent infection. The long and variable incubation period of HIV is because of this latency. During the period of latency, there is a high level of viral replication. It is estimated that 10 billion HIV particles are produced and destroyed each day. The gp120 present on the surface of the infected cell leads to fusion of the cells with the formation of multinucleated syncytia. The lysis of fused cells results in replenishment of a large number of uninfected cells from the circulation. HIV also causes accumulation of nonintegrated circular DNA copies of the genome, increased permeability of the plasma membrane, and induction of apoptosis. All these contribute to killing of the infected T cells. In addition, lysis of infected cell releases progeny virions to infect new cells. The CD4 cells are decreased in number, and the CD4:CD8 cell ratio is reversed. Viral infec-tion also suppresses the function of the infected cell without causing structural damage. The virus replicates continuously in the lymph nodes, thereby releasing the virions and infected T cells into the blood. Chap-68.indd 568 5/14/2012 12:59:55 PMSection IV Chapter 68HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 569 During the course of infection, the virus causes a drastic reduc-tion in the number of CD4 T cells, which may occur due to HIV-induced cytolysis, cytotoxin T-cell immune cytolysis, or natural terminal differentiation of T cells. The virus also infects brain monocytes producing multi- nucleated giant cells and significant central nervous system manifestations. The fusion of the HIV-infected cells in the brain and other sites is the key pathological finding. Host immunity HIV is characterized by development of both cell-mediated and humoral immunities against HIV-related proteins.Cell-mediated immunity: Cellular immunity is characterized by the development of cellular responses produced against HIV proteins. Suppression of cell-mediated T-cell immunity is the most profound consequence of HIV infection. CD4 helper T cell, monocytes, and macrophages are important components of CMI against HIV infection. The CD4 helper T cell plays a very important role in the outcome of immune responses. The CD4 helper cells are essential for (a) activation of macrophages and (b) induction of functions of cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells and B cells, and a variety of soluble factors that stimulate growth and differentiation of lymphoid cells. HIV binds directly to the CD4 receptors of the T helper cells, resulting in gradual depletion of the T-cell population. The deficiency or reduction of CD4 T cells leads to depres- sion of cellular immune response and impairment of humoral responses. The reduction of CD4 T cells is responsible for producing delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that leads to opportunistic infections caused by many opportunistic patho-gens. This causes CMI to gradually fail (i) to mount cytotoxic T-cell response to virally infected cells, (ii) to form delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, and (iii) to process new foreign substances presented to the immune system. Monocytes and macrophages also play an important role in the dissemination and pathogenesis of HIV infection. CCR5 chemo-kine receptors are the major HIV coreceptors present on monocytes and macrophages, which appear to be the major cell types infected with HIV in the brain. These cells, therefore, con-tribute immensely for development of neurological manifesta-tions associated with HIV infection. In the lungs, infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages may also play a role in the devel-opment of interstitial pneumonitis observed in some HIV patients. The macrophage-tropic strains of HIV are seen in large number early in the infection, and these strains are responsible even for transmission of the infection. The virus may enter brain through infected monocytes and release toxins to neurons as well as chemotactic factors that lead to infiltration of brain with inflammatory cells. The macrophage-tropic HIV viruses are usually not present, but may be present rarely in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes.Humoral immunity: Humoral immunity is characterized by the development of neutralizing antibodies produced against p24, gp120, gp41, and various proteins in most of the WHITE BLOOD CELL Coreceptor onwhite blood cellHIV Detailed structure of viral surface SUTM CD4 receptor onwhite blood cell FIG. Chap-68.indd 569 5/14/2012 12:59:56 PMSection IV Chapter 68570 VIROLOGY individuals infected with HIV. However, the level of neutralizing activities is low. In adults, antibody to gp120 develops several months after the initial viremia. The development of neutraliz-ing antibodies is associated with slow progression of disease in adults, children, and infants. The HIV escapes from the immune system of the host in many ways (Table 68-2). Key Points HIV escapes from the immune system through its ability: to integrate viral DNA with the host cell DNA, resulting in persistent infection, to undergo high rate of mutation of the env gene, to produce Tat and Nef proteins that downregulate class I MHC proteins required for cytotoxic T cells to recognize and kill HIV-infected cells, and to infect and kill CD4/H11001 helper T cells. Continuous virus reproduction in macrophages and CD4 T cells also main-tains the virus in an immune privileged state. Clinical Syndromes The course of untreated HIV infection is usually 10 years or longer. The disease progresses through the stages of ( a) primary infection, (b) dissemination of virus to lymphoid organs, (c) clinical latency, and (d) a late stage of profound immuno-suppression known as full-blown AIDS. HIV is associated with following clinical syndromes: Acute HIV infection Acute HIV infection is characterized by rapid rise in plasma vire-mia with a concomitant drop in CD4 count after an incubation period of 3-6 weeks. The symptoms of HIV are nonspecific and include low-grade fever, fatigue, malaise, rash, headache, and lymphadenopathy; spontaneous resolution may occur within weeks. HIV antibodies are usually absent in the serum at the onset of illness, but begin to appear after 3-4 weeks of the infec-tion. This condition is referred to as seroconversion illness. Serum antibodies are not demonstrated, but p24 antigen can be demonstrated during the beginning of the infection. Asymptomatic HIV infection This period is followed by an asymptomatic or clinically latent stage during which the patient continues to remain asymptom-atic for several months to years. This stage is characterized by a low level of viral replication and a gradual fall in CD4 count. The serum is positive for HIV antibodies in these patients. Another characteristic of the stage of latency is persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, which may last for several years or a period of asymptomatic infection. During this stage, virus continues to replicate in the lymph node. The persistent generalized lymph-adenopathy denotes the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in two or more noncontiguous extrainguinal sites that persist for at least 3 months in the absence of any current illness or medica-tion that may cause lymphadenopathy. This is a benign condi-tion but may progress to AIDS-related complex (ARC) or AIDS. AIDS-related complex AIDS-related complex is characterized by lymphadenopathy and fever. This has an insidious onset and may be associated with malaise and weight loss. Diarrhea, night sweats, fatigue, and opportunistic infections are the presenting symptoms. The patients with ARC may progress to AIDS in a few months. AIDS AIDS is the end-stage disease of the HIV infection. It denotes the irreversible breakdown of immune system of the host, making the infected host highly susceptible to a wide range of progressive opportunistic infections or unusual malignancies, such as Kaposi's sarcoma. AIDS is characterized by deteriora-tion of immune response as evidenced by CD4 T cell decrease response. The onset of clinical manifestations correlates with: a reduction in number of CD4 T cells to less than 450//H9262L, increased level of virus in the blood, and presence of p24 antigen in the blood. When CD4 count falls less than 200//H9262L, the patient develops full-blown AIDS. This stage is characterized by development of HIV wasting syndrome with weight loss and diarrhea for 1 month. This is also associated with many opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneu-monia, toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other diseases. Patients with AIDS show clinical manifestations in different ways. They can manifest as lymphadenopathy with fever, opportunistic infections, malignancies, and neurological manifestations of HIV, such as dementia.Opportunistic infections: The opportunistic infections are the severe infections induced by the agents that rarely cause serious disease in immunocompetent individuals. These oppor-tunistic infections are the predominant causes of morbidity and mortality among the patients with late-stage HIV infection and full-blown AIDS. These are usually associated with HIV-infected patients when their CD4 cell count falls to less than 200 cells//H9262L. The most common opportunistic infections caused by various pathogens, such as protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and fungi are summarized in Table 68-3. In patients with AIDS, coinfection with DNA virus often leads to enhanced expression of HIV in cells in vitro. Coinfection with herpes virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been shown to contribute to enhance expression of HIV in cells. The CMV Mechanism Method Inactivation of key element of immune defenseInfection of lymphocytes and macrophages Loss of activator of the immune system and delayed type hypersensitivityInactivation of CD4 helper cells Evasion of antibody detection Antigenic drift of gp120Evasion of antibody detection Heavy glycosylation of gp120TABLE 68-2Mechanisms of HIV escape from the immune system of the host Chap-68.indd 570 5/14/2012 12:59:56 PMSection IV Chapter interstitial pneumoniaHIV dementiaTABLE 68-3 Indicator diseases of AIDS has shown to produce a protein that acts as chemokine receptor and facilitates HIV to infect the cells.Malignancies: The patients with AIDS show a marked susceptibility to the development of malignancies. Human herpes virus-8-associated Kaposi's sarcoma is the most noted malignancy associated with AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma is much more common in untreated AIDS patients than in general population. It is a vascular tumor suggested to be of endothe-lial origin, which is found in the skin, mucous membrane, lymph node, and visceral organs. Other AIDS-associated malignant conditions include non- and anogenital cancer. Burkitt's lymphoma has been shown to be even much more common in AIDS patients than in general population.Neurological diseases: AIDS patients are associated with several distinct neurological syndromes. These include AIDS dementia complex, subacute encephalitis, vacuolar myelopa-thy, aseptic meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. AIDS dementia complex is the most common neurological manifes-tation of HIV and occurs due to HIV infection of the microglial cells and neurons of the brain. This condition is characterized by poor memory, inability to concentrate, apathy, automotor retardation, and behavioral changes. leukoencephalopathy are some of the common infectious diseases of the brain associated with patients of AIDS. Indicator diseases of AIDS are summarized in Table 68-3. Pediatric AIDS Pediatric AIDS is an important condition acquired from infected mothers. AIDS in pediatric populations usually occurs: by vertical transmission of HIV from infected mother or by perinatal transmission of HIV through breast-feeding. Children develop clinical manifestations by 2 years of age and subsequently die of AIDS in the following 2 years. The condi-tion is more severe in neonates because the immune system is very poor during the time of birth. Clinical manifestations of AIDS in children include pneumonia, severe oral candidiasis, interstitial pneumonitis, encephalopathy, wasting, general-ized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, growth retardation, and bacterial sepsis. The progression of vertically acquired HIV infection in chil- dren appears to have a trimodal distribution. Approximately, 15% of children have rapidly progressive disease and the remainder have a chronic progressive course or an infection pattern typical of that seen in adults. Children with perinatally acquired HIV infection, if remain untreated, show a very bad prognosis. The progression of the infection is very fast in the first year of life and is believed to be associated with higher viral load of HIV-1 in the blood. The replication of the virus in children shows a different pattern than that seen in adults. Viral RNA load is usually low at birth, but the level of virus then increases rapidly within the first 2 months of life, followed by slow decline at the age of 2 years. Progression of infection from acute HIV infection to AIDS occurs usually at a median 11 years after the infection. Earlier, many of the patients used to die within 1-2 years following diagnosis of AIDS, but now with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and better management of opportunistic infections, the death rates from AIDS have begun to decline significantly. In India, mean duration of sur-vival of a patient after diagnosis of HIV is 7 years 8 months. Epidemiology HIV infection is epidemic throughout the world. Geographical distribution HIV-1 is the most common cause of HIV infection in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. HIV-1 subtypes show differences in their geographical distribution. Subtype A predominates in West Africa; subtype B in the United States, Europe, and Australia; subtype C in India, China, and Southern Africa. HIV-2 is the most common cause of HIV epidemics in West Africa. This virus is also found in European countries. Since the first recognition of AIDS in the United States in 1981, the AIDS has become a worldwide disease, affecting a large number of population. The current estimate of world-wide disease prevalence is more than 38 million HIV infections. Chap-68.indd 571 5/14/2012 12:59:56 PMSection IV Chapter 68572 VIROLOGY As per estimation of the World Health Organization (WHO), 5 million new HIV infections are occurring each year; 90% of which are occurring in developing countries, generally in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The HIV seroprevalence rate among pregnant women is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, which ranges from 35% to 45%. The seroprevalence rate in pregnant women in Asia is 2%, and the vertical transmission of HIV from infected mothers to infants is 24% without breast-feeding. It has been estimated that Indian mothers infected with HIV can have a transmission rate as high as 48% with breast-feeding. More than 4.4 million children are infected worldwide, and the death of 3.2 million children has been reported due to HIV infection.India: The first incidence of HIV infection was documented among sex workers in Chennai, Madurai, and Vellore of Tamil Nadu in 1986-1987. The first case of AIDS was detected in the year 1986 from Mumbai. Since then, HIV infection has been documented from each part of India. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), India has estimated that by the year 2008, nearly 2.4 million people were living with HIV, next only to South Africa. The national HIV prevalence is varied from 0.4% to 1.3%. Distribution of HIV epidemic in India is varied and is based on the prevalence of HIV infection in the high- and low-risk groups. Different states in India have been classified as high-, medium-, and low-prevalence areas. Tamil Nadu, states with HIV prevalence over 1% even in low-risk population. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been shown to occur in India. Various studies have shown a high prevalence of subtype C in India. Nearly 78.4% strains in north India and 95% of strains in Kolkata and south India have been shown to be HIV 1C subtype. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection HIV is primarily a human infection. Humans infected with HIV and AIDS are the reservoir of infection. The high titer of HIV is found in the blood, semen, and vaginal secretions of the infected people; hence these are important sources of infection. The virus is also present in the breast milk of an infected mother.Transmission of HIV infection: HIV infection occurs either by the transfer of HIV-infected cells or free HIV not associated with cells. HIV transmission occurs in following ways (Fig. 68-4):Sexual transmission: HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and constitutes more than 70% of the HIV trans-mission. Sexual transmission is more common in heterosexual women and men than in homosexual men worldwide. Varied sexual behaviors, such as (a) more number of sexual partners, (b) sex with commercial sex workers, homosexuals, and (c) receptive anal sex have been reported to be increasingly associated with HIV infection. The presence of other sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, or herpes simplex virus type 2 infection increases the risk of sexual HIV transmission by more than 100 times. This is due to preexisting inflammation and ulcers caused by these diseases, which facilitate the transfer of HIV through mucosa. The risk to HIV significantly increases with an increase in the number of sexual contact with multiple partners.Transmission by blood transfusion: HIV is also transmitted by transfusion of infectious blood or blood products, such as serum, plasma, and cells from HIV-positive individuals. It can also be transferred by the organs donated from the HIV-positive individuals. HIV among health workers has also been documented following a needle stick injury with contaminated blood. However, the reported cases are relatively few, and the esti-mated risk of transmission is as low as 0.3%.Parenteral transmission: Parenteral transmission occurs largely among IV drug users. Injection users of illicit drugs are commonly infected through the use of contaminated needles. IV drug users constitute a substantial proportion of new cases of HIV in north-eastern states of India, Manipur. The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users in Manipur is increasing rapidly: from 2-3% in 1989 to more than 50% in 1991 and nearly 75% in early 2000. This increase is due to transmission of HIV through sharing of needles when injecting equipment is shared.Mother-to-child transmission: Mother-to-infant transmission can occur by vertical transmission or by perinatal transmission. Vertical HIV infection occurs in the following ways: 1. The fetus in utero can be inf ected by v ertical transmission of virus through the placenta or through the amniotic mem-brane if the membranes are infected or inflamed. Vertical Perinatal transmissionTransplacental transmissionDuring delivery through infected birth canalBreast feeding Contaminated needlesTransfusionSexual contact FIG. 68-4. Transmission of HIV Chap-68.indd 12:59:56 PMSection IV Chapter 68HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 573 transmission is most common during delivery of the baby of the infected mother. The risk of vertical transmission is greatly increased with an increase in duration of contact with the maternal blood and cervical vaginal secretions. 2. Perinatal infection in HIV occurs during the birth process or through breast-feeding. T ransmission of HIV during breast- feeding usually occurs by 6 months. Several studies have shown that nearly one-third to half of perinatal HIV infec-tion in Africa is caused by breast-feeding. Untreated women infect 13% and 40% children in Europe and Africa, respec-tively. Mother-to-infant HIV transmission rate varies between 36% and 40% in India. Relatively, the rate of postnatal transmission in Africa and other developing coun-tries is higher because of the practice of breast-feeding. Sexually active person, both heterosexual and homosexual, IV drug abusers and their sexual partners, and the newborns of HIV-positive mothers are at highest risk for HIV infection. Key Points HIV is not transmitted by touching, hugging, kissing, casual contact, coughing, and sneezing. It is also not transmitted by bite of insects or through water, food, utensils, or by swimming in swimming pools. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection is useful to: 1. Confirm the diagnosis of AIDS 2. Detect the individuals with HIV infection 3. Identify carriers who may transmit infections to others 4. Perform seroepidemiological studies in the community Specimens These include serum and plasma for HIV serology and lympho-cytes for isolation of HIV. Isolation of the virus Virus isolation is not a routinely used method for diagnosis of HIV infection because it is time-consuming and laborious. It is used mostly for research purpose. The virus can be isolated mostly from lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and occasionally from bone marrow, plasma, and other body fluids. In patients with AIDS, high titer of virus is found in the plasma and in lymphocytes than in the peripheral blood. Viruses are found mostly within CD4 cells.Cocultivation: It is the most sensitive method for isolation of virus. It is performed by cocultivating potentially infected and uninfected mononuclear cells to facilitate the replication of HIV. The viral growth in culture fluid is demonstrated by the presence of HIV p24 antigen and HIV reverse transcriptase. The test becomes positive after 7-14 days of culture or even may require a longer period of 28 days. The virus titer in asymptom-atic infection is low, hence may not be positive for virus by culture. Viral culture is useful for detection of high virus titer, which is found early in infection before the presence of HIV antibodies. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis includes demonstration of antibodies and viral antigens. Demonstration of antibodies Detection of specific antibodies to HIV in serum is the most commonly used method for serodiagnosis of patients with HIV and AIDS. Detectable level of antibodies is demonstrated in most individuals within 6-12 weeks after infection and in all the individuals within 6 months of infection. Key Points The time interval before an antibody appears in the serum is known as window period, and it may vary from 3 to 4 weeks. The serum of the patient tested during this period is negative for serum antibodies but positive for viral antigens. The diagnosis of HIV infection is established by demonstration of specific antibodies to envelope glycoproteins gp41, gp120, and gp160 and to viral core p24 antigens. The antibody response against these viral proteins is variable during the pro-gression of HIV infection to AIDS. Antibodies to envelope gly-coproteins persist in the serum, but those directed against Gag protein (p17, p24, p55) decrease. The antibody-based serological testing in HIV is of two types: (a) screening tests and (b) supplementary or comfirma-tory tests.Screening tests: Screening tests are otherwise known as ERS which is an acronym for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), rapid test, and simple test. These tests are usually highly sensitive tests and are used for initial screening of the serum samples for the presence of HIV antibodies.ELISA: ELISA is the most frequently used test for detection of both HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific antibodies in the serum. This test is highly sensitive and specific, and commercial ELISA kits are available, which detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies in the serum. ELISA can also be used for demonstration of anti-bodies in the saliva. This is very useful for testing injectable drug users from whom it may be difficult to collect blood due to collapsed blood vessels. ELISA in HIV serology are of four types: first generation, second generation, third generation, and fourth generation depending on the nature of the antigen used and detecting both antibodies and antigen in the serum (Table 68-4).Rapid tests: Rapid tests include dot blot assay, latex agglutina-tion, gelatin agglutination, HIV spot, and comb test, etc. These tests are simple tests, which can be performed in any laboratory without requiring any expensive instrument or skilled man-power. Moreover, test results can be read rapidly within 30 minutes of receipt of the specimen. Chap-68.indd 573 5/14/2012 12:59:56 PMSection IV Chapter 68574 VIROLOGY Simple tests: These tests are simple, do not require any expensive equipment, and can be performed within 1 or 2 hours.Supplementary or comfirmatory tests: These tests are used as confirmatory tests for detection of HIV antibodies. These tests are designed for a higher specificity than the screening tests, hence are used as the test of choice to verify the results of screening tests. Western blot, line immunoassay, and indirect immunofluorescence assay are the most commonly used sero-logic confirmatory tests.Western blot: It is the most common confirmatory test used in HIV serology. In this test, HIV viral antigens polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These antigens are then blotted onto strips of nitrocellulose paper. These strips are treated with test serum. Antibodies to these HIV proteins, if present in test serum, com-bine with different fragments of HIV and then react with enzyme conjugated antihuman globulin. These strips are washed, fol-lowed by addition of a suitable substrate, which produces colored bands. The position of the colored band on the strip indicates the antigen with which the antibody has reacted (Fig. 68-5). The demonstration of multiple bands indicates a positive test. The test is considered positive if it shows bands against at least two of the three viral proteins, namely, p24, gp41, and gp120 or gp160. The test is also considered positive if multiple bands are seen with multiple proteins, which are encoded by three genes (gag, pol, and env). This represents p24 of gag gene core protein, p31 of pol gene reverse transcriptase, gp41, gp120 or gp160 of env gene surface antigens. The development of bands at one site as with p24 or gp120 is considered equivocal and may happen in early infection and also may be nonspecific. Absence of any band indicates negative test. It was earlier practice to confirm positive result of any one screening test by Western blot, but since the test is cumber-some, expensive, and is not readily available, other strategies are available for confirmation of the cases. So the practice followed now is to perform either two different types of ELISA or an ELISA with any of the rapid tests. If a serum is positive for HIV antibodies by both these tests, the serum is then considered positive for HIV. In case of doubt, serum samples are retested after a period of 1 or 2 months.Other confirmatory tests: Line immunoassay in principle is similar to Western blot; however, it differs from Western blot by having artificial HIV antigens used on the strips than using viral lysis protein separated by polyacrylamide gel electropho-resis. Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) is another test used as a confirmatory test. Demonstration of viral antigen The antibody sandwich ELISA using specific monoclonal anti-bodies to HIV p24 is used to detect the viral capsid core antigen (p24 antigen) in blood. The p24 antigen appears much earlier than HIV antibodies during acute HIV infection, hence can be detected during window period, during which antibodies are not demonstrated in the serum. The p24 antigen appears usually 16 days after infection. The antibody sandwich ELISA using specific monoclonal antibodies to HIV p24 is used to detect p24 antigen. The p24 antigen often becomes undetect-able after HIV antibodies develop in the blood. This is due to formation of immune complexes by p24 with the antibodies. However, p24 antigen may appear later in the course of infec-tion, suggesting a very poor prognosis. Specific tests useful for laboratory diagnosis of HIV infec- tion and AIDS are summarized in Table 68-5.Types of ELISA Source of antigen Antigen/Antibody detection First-generation ELISACultured virus lysate Detection of antibodies Second-generation ELISARecombinant antigen Detection of antibodies Third-generation ELISASynthetic peptides Detection of antibodies Fourth-generation ELISAA mixture of synthetic peptides and recombinant glycopeptidesDetection of both antigens and antibodiesTABLE 68-4 ELISA in HIV FIG. 68-5.

These meth-ods are useful for quantitative estimation of viral load in the plasma. In a positive test, a five- or threefold change in the viral load indicates reliably a significant change in children younger than 2 years or in those older than 2 years, respec-tively. These tests should not be used until the diagnosis of HIV has been confirmed with a nonquantitative serodiag-nostic method because these tests may falsely show low viral loads in individuals who are HIV negative. HIV DNA PCR is a sensitive method for detection of HIV provirus present inside mononuclear cells by employing oligonucleotide directed at highly conserved regions of the virus genome. The advantage of this test is that it can be used to diagnose HIV within 24 hours of infection and it has a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 97%, respectively. The RT-PCR and NASBA for plasma are sensitive methods for detection of HIV-1 subtype B viruses, whereas bDNA method is sensitive for detection of other HIV subtypes. Monitoring status of HIV infection The laboratory monitoring of the status of HIV infection can be carried out by analysis of (i) T-cell subset, (ii) measurement of HIV RNA, and (iii) measurement of B2 microglobulin and neopterin.CD4/H11001 T cell count: This is an important indicator for moni-toring HIV infection. This count reflects the immunological competence of the patients with HIV or AIDS. A rapid decrease in the CD4 count in adults and in infants is a poor prognostic sign and requires the initiation or alteration of antiviral ther-apy. The absolute number of CD4 lymphocytes and the ratio of helper T inducer lymphocytes (CD4:CD8 ratio) are very low in HIV-infected people. The CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio is reversed to 0.5:1 from a normal level of 2:1. If the CD4 count is below 500//H9262L, it indicates progression of the disease and hence requires specific therapy against HIV. When the count falls below 200//H9262L, it indicates a very poor prognosis and shows the increased risk for serious infection of patient, particularly opportunistic infections.Measurement of HIV RNA: HIV RNA level in serum is an important predictive marker of disease progression and are used as prognostic marker to monitor the effectiveness of anti-HIV therapies. The test is also useful for early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to infected mothers.Measurement of B2 microglobulin and neopterin: B2 microglobulin and neopterin can be demonstrated in the serum or urine of HIV-infected people. The titer is low in asymptomatic HIV infection, but is elevated with the progres-sion of HIV disease. Other tests Tuberculin test or other tests for cell-mediated immunity is neg-ative, indicating a depressed cell-mediated immunity. Both IgE and IgA serum levels are elevated in the blood. Hematological parameters are altered in patients with HIV. There is a leukopenia with lymphocyte count less than 400//H9262 L and thrombocytopenia in patients with AIDS. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia is associated with the progression of disease. Hypoimmunoglobulinemia is observed in end-stage disease and is associated with poor prog-nosis. Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in patients with HIV. Anemia occurs in as many as 25% of cases at diagnosis and occurs in 80% of cases after sometime. Neutropenia is observed in 10% of early asymptomatic HIV infections and in 50% of patients with AIDS. Strategies for HIV testing in India The following are the three different strategies followed for HIV testing in India:Strategy 1: In this strategy, test serum is subjected once to ERS test, and if positive the sample is considered as HIV infected and if negative the serum is considered to be free of HIV. For this purpose usually highly sensitive and very reliable diagnostic kits are used. This strategy is used for screening of blood, organ, and tissue before transfusion and transplantation.Strategy 2: In this strategy, a serum sample is considered negative if the first ERS test report reports it so. But if positive, it is retested with a second ERS test based on different antigen preparation and different test principles. The serum specimen if also found positive with second ERS test, it is reported as positive, and otherwise it is considered as negative. This strategy is used for HIV surveillance.Strategy 3: It is similar to strategy 2, but with an added confir-mation by a third ERS test. The third test should be based on different antigen preparation or test principle. A serum show-ing positive result on all three ERS tests is reported positive. The test is considered equivocal if the serum is negative in the third ERS. In such cases, serum specimens are retested on collection after 3 weeks. If this specimen also shows an equivocal result, the person is considered to be negative for HIV antibodies. This strategy is used for diagnosis of HIV infection in asymptom-atic persons. The tests used in second and third strategies are of higher specificity in order to rule out any false positivity. Interpretation of various laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of HIV infections is summarized in Table 68-6. Treatment Antiretroviral treatment is the mainstay in HIV treatment. The goals of antiretroviral therapy are to inhibit replication of HIV and to reduce morbidity and death. Anti-HIV drugs The anti-HIV drugs can be broadly classified as: (a) nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or (c) protease inhibitors. Antiretroviral agents against HIV are summarized in Box 68-1. Chap-68.indd 575 5/14/2012 12:59:56 PMSection Azidothymidine other nucleoside analogs inhibit the enzyme reverse transcriptase and alter their incorporation into DNA to cause chain termination. These agents prevent the spread of the virus to uninfected cells. AZT is recommended for treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic people with CD4 count of less than 500/ /H9262L. This is also recommended for treatment of pregnant women to reduce the possibility of transmission of the virus to the fetus. The toxicity associated with high doses of AZT and the emergence of resistance to AZT is the main disadvantage of monotherapy with AZT. Zidovudine is also used effectively to reduce significant transmission of HIV from mother to infant. The treatment decreases vertical transmission at all levels of maternal viral load.Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): NNRTIs, such as nevirapine, efavirenz, the enzyme by blocking the morphogenesis of the virion by inhibiting the cleavage of the Gag and Gag core polyproteins. This in turn prevents activation of the virion.Protease inhibitors: inhibitors, such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, and amprenavir, prevent the maturation of viral particle during late stage of viral replication. Monotherapy with antiretroviral therapy failed to produce significant clinical benefits including survival of the patient. The failure is partly due to the development of drug-resistant variants of HIV because resistance develops rapidly during monotherapy and cross-resistance between related drugs is also being increasingly reported. Multidrug therapy reduces morbidity due to the disease and death in many patients due to AIDS is delayed. Prevention and Control These include the following steps: (a) health education, ( b) screening of blood and blood products, (c) infection con- trol, and (d) vaccine development.Nucleoside reverse test Rapid tests: dot blot assay, latex agglutination, HIV spot, and comb testScreening test Western blot Confirmation test Indirect immunofluorescence testConfirmation test Antigen detectionp24 antigen Early marker of infection Molecular diagnosisBranched-chain DNA Detection of virus in blood Viral RNA RT-PCR Detection of virus in blood Isolation of virus Test not readily available CD4: CD8 T-cell ratio Correlates of human immunodeficiency virus diseaseTABLE 68-6Interpretation of laboratory tests in diagnosis of Combination of therapy Indinavir/AZT/3TC Ritonavir/AZT/3TC Nelfinavir/AZT/3TC Nevirapine/AZT/ddI Nevirapine/indinavir/3TCBox 68-2 Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)Key Points Therapy with combination of antiretroviral drugs, referred to as HAART, is effective in inhibition of HIV replication. HAART, a strategy similar to the treatment of tuberculosis, has improved efficacy of the therapy, minimized toxicity following therapy, and delayed emergence of drug resis-tance (Box 68-2). It is usually recommended to initiate double and triple drug therapy with two NRTIs Or two NRTIs /H11001 Chapter 68HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 577 Health education Health education plays a key and important role for the prevention of AIDS in the absence of a suitable vaccine. Health education is aimed at behavioral changes and maintenance of a lifestyle that minimizes or eliminates the risk of transmission. Health education includes the following: Safe sexual practice by using a condom, which prevents transmission of the virus. Not sharing unsterile needles or syringes. Information to HIV-positive women regarding the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to infants. Screening of blood and blood products It is essential to screen potential blood donors before they donate blood or blood products before use. The infected per-sons who are tested positive for HIV should refrain from donat-ing blood, plasma, body organs, other tissues, or sperm. The blood of the donors should be screened for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies by screening tests, such as ELISA. Regular screen-ing of blood for HIV antibodies before transfusion has reduced considerably the transmission of HIV by contaminated blood. Infection control Infection control methods include the use of universal blood and body fluids precautions. These universal precautions include wearing protective clothings, such as gloves, masks, gown, etc., and using other barriers to prevent exposure to blood products. These also include disinfection of contaminated surface with 10% household bleach, 70% ethanol or isopropanol, 2% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde, or 6% hydrogen peroxide. Washing clothes in hot water with adequate detergents is effective to kill HIV. Vaccine development A safe and effective vaccine is yet to be available against HIV. An ideal HIV vaccine is that which would: prevent acquisition of the virus by an adult during sexual intercourse, prevent transmission of virus to infants of HIV-positive mothers, and also block the progression of the disease. There are many scientific obstacles to the development of AIDS vaccine. This is mainly due to various problems unique to the HIV as mentioned below: 1. Antigenic diversity and hypervariability of the virus, as the antigenicity of the virus changes readily through mutation. 2. T ransmission of the disease by mucosal route\u2014initial protection should req uire the production of secretory antibodies to prevent sexual transmission and acquisition of the virus. 3. Transmission of the virus by infected cells. 4. Latency of the virus\u2014the virus can be spread through syncytium and remain latent, thereby remaining pro tected from antibodies. 5. Integration of the virus genome into the host cell chromosome. 6. Rapid emergence of viral escape mutants in the host\u2014the high error rate of the viral reverse transcrip tase leads to continuous mutations in the HIV genome. Vaccines Most of the HIV vaccines have been evaluated by using gp120 or its precursor gp160 as immunogen. The gene for this protein has been cloned, expressed in different eukaryotic systems, and developed as a subunit vaccine. In India, the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune is evaluating DNA/H11001 pox virus (canary pox, fowl pox) and MVA (modified vaccinia Ankara), a highly attenuated host-range-restricted strain of vaccinia virus. The vaccine has undergone phase I clinical trial with AAV (adeno-associated virus) AIDS vaccine in 2005. The second AIDS vaccine clinical evaluation is being set up at TRC (Tuberculosis Research Centre), Chennai. A 25-year-old college student, resident of an area endemic for HIV, in Manipur was admitted with several complaints. He had serious bouts of diarrhea with a history of marked weight loss during the past one year. He was found to be a drug addict. His stool samples were positive for oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The serum was tested positive for HIV antibodies by ELISA. The person was diagnosed to be suffering from AIDS. What are the other laboratory tests you will perform to confirm the diagnosis? What are the other opportunistic infections associated with AIDS? How did the boy acquire the infection? What do you mean by the term ART. Describe the recent developments in the field?CASE STUDY Chap-68.indd 577 5/14/2012 12:59:57 PM69 Introduction Slow infectious diseases are a large group of related neurodegenerative conditions, which affect both humans and animals. The diseases are caused by a heterogeneous group of agents consisting of conventional viruses and the unconven-tional agents that are called prions. The term \"slow\" refers to the disease process and not to the replication of the viruses that cause the slow disease. Replication rate of virus is similar to that of most other viruses. A list of slow infectious diseases caused by prions and conventional viruses is presented in Table 69-1. Slow Diseases Caused by Prions The agents causing slow diseases were earlier called as slow virus, infectious protein, infectious amyloids, or crystal protein. These agents are now being named prions, and this term has gained wide acceptance, replacing all the previously used terms. The prions are unconventional agents that are not viruses. Slow Viruses and Prions Agent of deer, mule, and elkVirus VisnaTABLE 69-1Slow diseases caused by prions and conventional virusesKey Points Prions are small protein-containing infectious particles with no detectable nucleic acid. The protein is yet to be characterized fully and appears to be a modified host protein. The diseases caused by prions are a large group of related neurodegenerative conditions, which affect both humans and animals. These diseases belong to a family of diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). There are six kuru, ( e) fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and (f) sporadic fatal insomnia. Animal TSEs caused by prions include ( a) scrapie and visna (diseases of sheep), (b) bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; mad cow disease), (c) transmissible mink encephalopathy, and (d) chronic wasting disease of deer, mule, and elk. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in humans caused by the prions show following characteristics: 1. Long incubation period of several years. 2. Course of illness lasting for months to years. 3. A progressive debilitating neurological syndrome that is invariably fat al. 4. Associated with pathological changes typically restricted to the central nerv ous system (CNS). 5. Absence of specific immunological response in the host. 6. The agents are resistant to conventionally used inactiva-tion methods. History Kuru was the first human disease known to be caused by a slow virus, or prion (1959). This condition was found among \"Fore\" people, a tribe living in the remote highlands of New Guinea. This virus was linked to ritualistic cannibalism prevalent among these tribal people. Hallow (1959) suggested that kuru could be a possible human form of scrapie, a slow viral disease seen in sheep. Gajdusek and his colleagues (1966) first demon-strated that kuru was transferable to chimpanzee after a long period of incubation, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize. Since then many TSEs, linked to slow viruses, are being described both in humans and animals. Chap-69.indd 578 5/14/2012 12:59:13 PMSection IV Chapter 69SLOW VIRUSES AND 579 Properties of the Prions Prions are small protein-containing infectious particles with no detectable nucleic acid. They were suspected to be viruses but otherwise do not conform to the standard definition of viruses. They differ from the viruses in their many properties (Table 69-2). The prions show following characteristics: 1. Prions like viruses are filterable. 2. They apparently lack any virion structure or genome. 3. Unlike viruses, they are unusually resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfect ants, and radiation. 4. They do not elicit any specific immune response in the infected host. Morphology Different hypotheses have been suggested for the makeup of prions. Initially many research workers considered prions to be (a) nucleic acid only, (b) protein only, (c) lacking both protein and nucleic acid, and (d) polysaccharide. Currently, the most widely accepted hypothesis is the \"protein only hypothesis\" first suggested by Griffith (1965) and re-established subsequently by Prusiner to indicate that scrapie is related to a proteinaceous infectious particle (PrP). Prions show following features: The prion does not contain any nucleic acid. It contains an aggregate of hydrophobic glycoprotein, resistant to protease. The protein present in humans and other animals is called cellular prion protein. It is similar to glycoprotein in scrapie known as scrapie prion protein, which has a molecular weight ranging from 27,000 to 30,000 Da. It is similar to scrapie prion protein in its protein sequence but differs from it in being sensitive to protease (scrapie protein is protease resistant) and being present in plasma membrane (scrapie prion protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles). Prion replication In experimental animal studies carried out in chimpanzees, Prusiner demonstrated conclusively that the prion, an aberrant Feature Prion Virus Presence of nucleic acid No Yes Defined morphology No Yes Disinfection by: Formaldehyde No Yes Heat (80\u00b0C) No Most are affected Ionizing and UV radiation No YesDisease: Incubation period Long Depends on virus Immune response No Yes Cytopathologic effect No Yes Inflammatory response No YesTABLE 69-2 Differences between prions and virusesprotein, could cause disease, for which he was awarded Nobel Prize in 1997. Prusiner hypothesis suggests that prions do not contain any nucleic acid. The normal prion protein known as prion protein cellular or PrP C has a significant amount of helical configuration. In its alpha-helical configuration, PrPC is usually sensitive to degradation by the activity of enzyme protease. Disease occurs when the PrP C is reconfigured into the beta- sheet configuration known as prion protein scrapie or PrPSC, which is resistant to degradation by protease. These abnormal proteins are resistant not only to protease degradation but also to radiation, heat, and other agents that destroy proteins. These aggregate into filaments that disrupt neuron functions and cause death of cells. Both the normal alpha-helical form and the abnormal beta-pleated sheet form have the same amino acid sequence but differ in their configuration. Other properties Prions, unlike viruses, are unusually resistant to heat at 80\u00b0C, ultraviolet radiation, and disinfectants, such as formaldehyde. They are, however, inactivated by phenol, ether, sodium hydroxide, and hypochlorite. Prion Isolation Prions cannot be cultivated in any tissue culture or isolated in any experimental animal models. Pathogenesis and Immunity Prion disease is transmitted either orally or transcutaneously. But how the prions reach the CNS, their target, is yet to be understood fully. It is believed that a functional immune system is essential for replication of prions and their transport to the reticuloendothelial cells. In these cells, large amounts of prions are present in the follicular dendritic cells as well as in the sympathetic nerve endings. From these sites, the prions reach the CNS\u2014but how they reach the CNS is still an impor-tant issue. It is suggested that the prions may reach the CNS via splanchnic nerves at the level of the thoracic spinal cord and via parasympathetic fibers connecting with the brain. The other possible route is by the blood circulation. In experimental animal studies carried out in chimpanzees, Prusiner demonstrated that scrapie protein (PrP SC) binds to the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) of the host. PrPC is found in most tissues of the body but is expressed in higher quantities in the CNS particularly the neurons, the main site of action of prions. PrP SC is ingested by neurons and phagocytic cells but continues to remain intact without being degraded. This may contribute to vacuolation of the neuron, a key pathological change observed in encephalitis caused by prions. In addition, accumulation of prions in high concentration causes damage in the brain tissue. These include the formation of amyloid-containing plaques and fibrils, a proliferation and hypertrophy of astrocytes, and fusion of neurons and adjacent glial cells. Pathogenesis and transmission of prion diseases in humans are described in Table 69-3. Chap-69.indd 579 5/14/2012 12:59:14 PMSection IV Chapter 69580 VIROLOGY immunity The prions cause encephalopathy, a condition which denotes a pathologic process in which no tissue inflammation or no immune responses are induced in the host, by which it is dif-ferentiated from that of viral encephalitis. In the symptom-atic patients, a protein called 14-3-3 brain protein has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Clinical Syndromes Slow diseases caused by prions in humans Prions cause following diseases in humans: (a CJD, ) fatal familial insomnia. Kuru: Kuru is a fatal neurological disease described only among Fore tribe inhabiting the highlands of New Guinea. The disease was spread by cannibalistic funeral practice of the tribal population. This involved the ritualistic practice by the closest female relatives and children usually consuming the brain of the person following his or her death. The brain which contained most of the infectious pathogen was the source of infection. Kuru has largely disappeared today because cannibalism has been abolished now among the Fore tribal people. Kuru is a fatal disease characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and tremors. The condition manifests initially as difficulty in walking, followed by cerebellar tremor, hence the name kuru, which means \"trembling in fear\". Eventually the tremor worsens, followed by progressive cerebellar ataxia and eventual death within a year of onset of symptoms. The clinical course lasts for 3 months to 2 years.Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: CJD is the most common prion disease responsible for nearly 85% of all human prion diseases. The condition was described by Creutzfeldt (1920) and Jakob (1921), after whom the disease is named. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a subacute progressive encephalopathy characterized by a rapidly progressive dementia, associated with myoclonic jerks. Memory loss, behavioral changes, and confusion are the common clinical manifestations. The condition is also associated with ataxia, aphasia, visual loss, and hemiparesis. The condition progresses and in the terminal stage of the disease, the patient becomes mute and comatose. The condi-tion is associated with extensive cortical spongiosis, gliosis, and neural loss. The condition is invariably fatal and death occurs in about 8 months.Variant CJD: The vCJD is a new disease affecting mostly adults aged 45 years. The condition was first documented in Britain in 1985. It is BSE zoonoses, probably originating from a double species switch from sheep scrapie to BSE and then from BSE to human variant. The vCJD is believed to be caused by ingestion of BSE-infected beef products contaminated by neural tissues. This is because neural tissues have a much higher concentra-tion of PrP SC compared with any other non-neural tissue. Gerstmann-Str\u00e4ussler-Scheinker syndrome: The condition was originally described in 1936 as affecting humans. The main clinical findings of the condition are slowly progressive limb and truncal ataxia, as well as dementia. Death of the patient usually occurs within 3-8 years of presentation of symptoms.Fatal familial insomnia: Patients with this illness present with intractable insomnia, dysautonomia, dementia, and motor paralysis. Death occurs within 6 months to 3 years following presentation. The clinical presentation of the disease, however, varies widely; hence definitive diagnosis of the condition is made by genotyping.Disease Pathogenesis Transmission Kuru Cannibalism Ingesting or handling brain tissue Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Infectious Contact with or handling prion- containing materialsCuts in the skinTransplantation of contaminated tissue, such as corneaUse of contaminated medical devices, such as brain electrodesPossibly through ingestion of infected tissue Hereditary Mutations in the germ cells Hereditary predilection Sporadic No relationship to any cause Spontaneous PrP C Conversion to PrPSC Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Infection from BSE Probably by eating meat or nervous tissue from animals with mad cow diseaseBlood transfusion Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome Mutations in the PrP gene Hereditary/genetic Fatal familial insomnia D 178N mutation in the PrP gene, with M129 polymorphismHereditary/genetic Sporadic fatal insomnia No relationship to any cause Spontaneous PrP C Conversion to PrPSC Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Central nervous system demylinationTABLE 69-3 Pathogenesis and transmission slow diseases Chap-69.indd 580 5/14/2012 12:59:14 PMSection IV Chapter 69SLOW VIRUSES AND 581 Slow diseases caused by prions in animals Prions cause following diseases in animals: (a) scrapie, (b) bovine encephalopathy, (c) feline spongiform encephalopathy, (d) transmissible mink encephalopathy, and (e) chronic wasting disease of deer, mule, and elk.Scrapie: Scrapie is a prototype prion disease of animals. It is a slow virus disease of the sheep, known for centuries. The infection is transmitted vertically from ewe to lamb and less frequently by direct contact. Incubation period is nearly 2 years. The condition manifests as intense irritation, and to relieve that the infected animals scratch themselves, against trees and rocks, hence the name scrapie. The condition progresses to emaciation and paralysis and finally leads to death of the animal. Autopsy of the infected brain shows spongiform degeneration without inflammation in the brain tissue. The condition has been documented extensively.Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE): Also known as mad cow disease. It is a disease of cattle. The condition has an incuba-tion period of 2-8 years. The disease is relentlessly progressive until the animal dies. The cattle feed containing prion-contami-nated meat and bone meal, which was used as a protein source, was the source of infection for trans mission of BSE to cattle. The causative agent is believed to be originated from either scrapie affected sheep or cattle with unidentified prion-associated slow virus disease. The mad cow disease, documented in 1986, has been described in cattle in the European countries and in the United States. Till 2004, nearly 190,000 confirmed clinical cases of BSE in cattle have been reported worldwide; the majority of which were from the United Kingdom alone.Transmissible mink encephalopathy: Transmissible mink enceph alopathy is a scrapie-like disease of mink. The causative agent is believed to be a strain of scrapie virus, which is trans-mitted to mink by feeding the animals on scrapie-infected sheep meat.Chronic wasting disease of deer, mule, and elk: Chronic wasting disease is a prion disease of deer, mule, and elk. It is a progressive wasting disease of these animals in the United States. Epidemiology Prion-related diseases are rare but worldwide. Geographical distribution Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is rare but is found throughout the world with an incidence of about one case per million populations. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance linked to mutation in the PrP gene is found in nearly 10% cases of familial CJD. Till 2003, a total of 167 definite and probable cases of vCJD have been reported worldwide. Most of the cases of vCJD have been reported in the United Kingdom. The condition is yet to be documented from Asia. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease syndrome and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) in humans are rare but occur in different parts of the world. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection The spongiform encephalopathies caused by prions may be infectious, hereditary, and sporadic. The CJD, GSS, and FFI are inheritable. The CNS has the highest concentra-tion of prion agent, hence is the most important source of infection. Unlike the prion disease, in vCJD, lymphoid tissues show highest concentration of prions. Contaminated blood is another source of infection. Key Points Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is transmitted by: cuts in the skin, transplantation of contaminated tissue (e.g., cornea), use of contaminated medical devices (e.g., brain electrodes), possibly through ingestion of infected tissue, and blood transfusion. Brain surgery patients, transplant patients, and surgeons also are at risk for CJD and GSS disease. Sporadic CJD is a type of infection that refers to the occurrence of disease in the absence of an infectious or hereditary form of the disease. Families with genetic history of the disease have been identified in cases of GSS syndrome. Hosts and pathogenesis of prion-related slow diseases in animals are summarized in Table 69-4. Laboratory Diagnosis The diagnosis of prion diseases is always clinical. It is usu-ally confirmed by the histopathology of the brain tissue showing characteristic histological changes. No serological tests are available, as prions are inert agents and do not elicit any immune response in infected hosts. The prions cannot be detected in the infected tissue by any method including the electron microscopy, antigen detection, and genomic methods, such as DNA probe or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Detection of protein 14-3-3 in the CSF by Western blot is a sensitive and specific method in cases of sporadic CJD and in vCJD. A specific reduction in uric acid level in the CSF has been shown in vCJD but not in sporadic CJD, thus facilitating in the differential diagnosis of vCJD.

Prevention and Control Prions are highly resistant to inactivation by disinfectants used for other viruses, such as formaldehyde, detergents, and ionizing radiations. Hence, the materials from patients with CJD or vCJD must be handled with special care. For prevention of these diseases, special disinfection protocols have been developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These include auto-claving at 15 lbs for 1 hour (instead of 20 minutes) or treatment with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide and 5% hypochlorite solution. Since cases of blood transfusion-associated CJD have been reported, it is a matter of great concern. However, currently no method including PCR is available for demonstration of the agent in the blood. Slow Diseases Caused by Conventional Viruses in Humans Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the three slow diseases caused by conven-tional viruses in humans. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis The is of the CNS caused by persistent measles infection. It is a persistent infection by a variant measles virus that fails to complete its replication. The disease is characterized by the development of behavioral and intellectual deterioration and seizures after many years (mean incubation period is 10.8 years) of infection by measles. This is a serious and late neurological sequel of measles that affects the CNS. The condition occurs in about seven in every one million patients. The condition is associated with the presence of an extremely high measles antibody titer in the blood and CSF. Inclusion bodies, which react with antibodies to measles virus, are present in the affected neurons.Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a fatal demy-elinating disease of the white matter of the brain. The condition is usually fatal. It occurs primarily in persons with compromised cell-mediated immunity, such as patients with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive drugs and anticancer therapy. JC virus or John Cunningham virus (JCV) is the causative agent of PML. The virus following the infection kills oligoden-droglia and causes syncytia in astrocytes. Reactivation of the virus in immunocompromised patients causes activation of latent virus, thereby causing the disease. Changes in mental status, alteration in the vision, and weakness are the initial clinical manifestations. The condition progresses rapidly to blindness, dementia, and coma. The patient usually dies within 6 months. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by PCR for viral genome in the brain tissue or CSF. Serum antibodies to JC are demonstrated in approximately three fourth of normal sera; hence serology is not useful. No specific antiviral treatment is available. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome AIDS caused by human immunodeficiency virus has a long latent period. Hence, the disease is also considered as an example of slow disease with a progressive course and involvement of the CNS. The details of the disease are described in Chapter 68. Slow Diseases Caused by ConventionalViruses in Animals Visna Visna is a disease of sheep caused by visna virus, a lentivirus. It is a single-stranded RNA virus with an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in the virion. Integration of the DNA provirus into the host cell DNA appears to be responsible for persistence of the virus within the host. Clinically, the condition manifests after a long incubation period with a prolonged progressive course. It has an insidious onset with paresis, progressing to total paralysis and death. The viruses are present in the saliva, blood, and CSF of the infected animal. High levels of serum antibodies are present in the serum, but these are not protective. A 45-year-old adult, resident of the United Kingdom, was admitted with presentations of memory loss, behavioral changes, and confusion. Ataxia, aphasia, visual loss, and hemiparesis were the other manifestations. Subsequently, the patient became comatose and died within a week of admission. The patient was strongly suspected to be suffering from CJD. How will you confirm diagnosis of the disease in the laboratory? How this disease is transmitted to humans? What is variant form of CJD? Describe the pathogenesis of prion-mediated diseases. STUDY Chap-69.indd 582 5/14/2012 12:59:14 PM70 Introduction Miscellaneous viruses described in this chapter include a diverse group of viruses that have been increasingly associ-ated with infections in humans. These viruses include rubella virus, Norwalk virus, viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) viruses, arena viruses, and coronaviruses including the most recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Rubella Virus Rubella virus causes rubella, a mild viral disease affecting the skin, lymph nodes, and less commonly, the joint. It also causes congenital rubella syndrome. It is an RNA virus classified as a rubivirus in the family Togaviridae. Properties of the Virus Morphology Rubella virus shows following features: It is a pleomorphic, roughly spherical virus measuring 50-70 nm in diameter. It consists of a single-stranded RNA genome, an icosahedral nucleocapsid, and lipoprotein envelope. The virus unlike measles and mumps viruses has a positive-strand RNA, therefore does not contain any virion polymerase. The envelope contains hemagglutinin peplomers. Viral replication Rubella virus penetrates the cell and uncoats, and the positive-strand RNA genome is translated into several structural and nonstructural proteins. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an important nonstructural protein, which replicates the genome first by making progeny. The virion acquires its envelope from the outer membrane of cell as the virion comes out of the cell. Both replication and assembly of the virion occur in the cyto-plasm of the cell. Antigenic and genomic properties Rubella has only one serotype. Other properties The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of human, chick, goose, and pigeon at 4\u00b0C. The virus is heat sensitive. It is readily inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C, but survives for several years at /H1100260\u00b0C. The virus is inactivated by chemicals, such as beta- propiolactone, formaldehyde, chloroform, and ether. Virus Isolation The virus is grown with difficulty in the cell lines. The virus is not cytolytic but produces limited cytopathologic effects in certain cell lines, such as Vero and RK-13 cell lines. In cell line, the replication of rubella prevents the replication of superinfec-tious picornavirus. This phenomenon is known as heterologous interference, which is made use of in detection of rubella virus. Pathogenesis and Immunity Pathogenesis of rubella Initially rubella virus infects the nasopharynx of the upper respiratory tract and then spreads to local lymph nodes. From there, the virus spreads by the blood throughout the body to the internal organs and skin. The occurrence of mild rash is characteristic. The exact cause of pathogenesis of rash is not known, but may be due to antigen-antibody mediated vasculi-tis. During prodromal period and for nearly 2 weeks after the onset of rash, the infected persons continue to secrete virus in the respiratory droplets. Host immunity Rubella infection is characterized by development of circulat-ing antibodies, which are produced after the phase of viremia and their development correlates with the appearance of the rash. The circulating antibodies limit the spread of the virus in the blood. These antibodies also cross the placenta and protect the newborn from an attack of rubella. Natural rubella infection usually confers lifelong immunity. Reinfection may occur occasionally after the natural disease or vaccination or exposure to the virus. The formation of immune complexes is suggested to contribute to the development of rash and arthralgia associated with rubella infection. Clinical Syndromes VIROLOGY Rubella Incubation period varies from 14 to 21 days. Rubella is a milder and more subtle disease than measles. A three-day maculopap-ular or macular rash, which starts on the face and progresses downward to involve the extremities, is the characteristic pre-sentation in symptomatic cases. The rash typically lasts 3 days. Tender lymphadenopathy that affects all the nodes but most commonly affects suboccipital, postauricular, anterior, and posterior cervical nodes is the hallmark of rubella. In adults, rubella produces a more severe disease with mani- festations of syndrome Congenital rubella syndrome is the most severe and important complication of rubella, which occurs in the fetus of pregnant women without immunity to the virus. The fetus is at major risk until fifth month of pregnancy. Maternal immunity to the virus due to prior exposure or vaccination prevents spread of the virus to the fetus. In the first trimester, 80% of the infants would be affected, and severity of the disease depends on how early the infection occurs. Cataract, mental retardation, and deafness are the most common manifestations of congenital rubella infection. The congenital rubella results in congenital anomalies or even death of the fetus. In addition, the infants infected in utero continue to excrete rubella virus for up to 1 year. These children constitute a public health hazard because they are considered as an exposure threat to nonimmune pregnant women. The virus can be transmitted to pregnant women from children. Epidemiology Humans are the natural host. The disease is prevalent worldwide. In countries where vaccination is not routinely used, epidemics of rubella occur every 6-9 years. Respiratory droplets are the source of infection. The virus is transmitted from person-to- person by inhalation of respiratory droplets. The infection is usually acquired during childhood. Patients are most contagious during the time of appearance of the rash. The viruses are excreted in the pharynx and in the respiratory droplets from 7 days before until 7 days after the rash. The infection is usually acquired during childhood. The infection can also be transmitted transplacentally from mother to fetus, resulting in congenital infection. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens Throat swab in the adult and urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or throat swab in infants with congenital rubella are the fre-quently used specimens. Isolation of the virus Viruses can be isolated in rabbit kidney (RK-13), rabbit cor-nea (SIRC), and Vero cells. The virus produces little cytopathic effects. Key Points In Vero and rabbit cornea cell lines, the virus is usually identified by its ability to interfere with echovirus cytopathic effect. In this method, if the rubella virus is present in the patient's specimen and has grown in cell culture, no cytopathic effect will appear when the culture is superinfected with an echovirus, such as echo 11. Rubella virus grown in cell line can also be detected by detection of antigen in cell lines by direct fluorescent antibody method. Virus isolation is rarely used, because isolation of the virus is difficult. Serodiagnosis The diagnosis of rubella is usually confirmed by demonstra-tion of rubella antibodies in the serum. Demonstration of specific IgM rubella antibodies in a single acute phase serum sample is diagnostic of rubella. Diagnosis can also be made by demonstration of a fourfold or a greater rise in IgG antibody titer between acute phase and convalescent phase using hemagglutination inhibition test or enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). In pregnant women, demonstration of IgM rubella antibodies indicates recent infection. Demonstration of 1:8 or greater titer of IgG antibody in serum indicates immunity and consequent protection of the fetus. Demonstration of rubella virus in amniotic fluid collected by amniocentesis indicates a definite rubella infection in the fetus. The presence of IgM antibodies in the serum of the infant indicates recent infection because IgM does not cross the placenta from the mother as does IgG. Confirmation of diagnosis of congenital rubella syndrome in an infant after 1 year with serology alone is very difficult. Treatment There is no antiviral therapy. Prevention Preventive measures include vaccination and administration of immunoglobulins. Vaccination Prevention of rubella is best carried out by immunization with live attenuated vaccine. The main objective of rubella vaccina-tion program is to prevent congenital infection by decreasing the number of susceptible people, especially children. Vaccination causes a significant reduction of the likelihood of exposure of the pregnant women to the virus (refer the box Vaccine). Immunoglobulins can be given to pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy who have been exposed to a known case of rubella and for whom termination of pregnancy is not an option. Nevertheless, cases of congenital rubella syndrome have occurred in infants born to mothers who received immu-noglobulins shortly after exposure. No adequate treatment is available for pregnant women exposed to rubella. Chap-70.indd 584 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70MISCELLANEOUS Vaccines Live rubella vaccine contains live, cold-adapted RA-27/3 vaccine strain grown in human diploid cells. The virus is usually administered as measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine). The vaccine is very effective and induces long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity. It causes few side effects, such as transient arthralgia in some women. The vaccine also induces production of respiratory IgA, thereby interrupting the spread of virus by nasal droplets. The use of vaccine has resulted in significantly reduced incidence of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome worldwide. This vaccine is usually given subcutaneously to children 15 months of age. It is also recommended for unimmunized young adult women if they are not pregnant and for those women who will not conceive for the next 3 months. It is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in immunocompromised patients. Norwalk Virus Norwalk virus is one of the most common causes of viral gas-troenteritis in adults. Classification Norwalk virus is a calcivirus in the family Calciviridae. The calciviruses are small, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. The calciviruses although show many features similar to those of picornaviruses, they differ from those by having a large genome and by having distinct spikes on the surface. There are two important calciviruses, which cause infection in humans: Norwalk virus and Hepatitis E virus. The latter virus is described in Chapter 66. Properties of the Virus Norwalk virus shows following features: Norwalk viruses are round viruses with a ragged outline. The genome is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA genome. The RNA genome is present a 27-nm naked capsid consisting of one 60,000-Da capsid protein. The genome does not contain any virion polymerase. Ten prominent spikes and 32 cup-shaped depressions can be seen on the virion by microscopy. Viral replication The Norwalk virus replicates in the cytoplasm with release of viral particles on cell destruction. The virus is presumed to replicate in a manner similar to that of picornaviruses. Antigenic and genomic properties The number of serotypes is not known. Other properties Norwalk viruses are stable and can survive with freezing or at temperatures of up to 140\u00b0F. They are also resistant to inactivation by chlorination of water and to drying in the environment. Pathogenesis and Immunity Norwalk viruses are highly contagious. As low as 100 viral particles can establish infection, which is typically limited to the mucosal cells of the intestinal tract. Infection is charac-terized by damage to microvilli in the small intestine, causing malabsorption. The virus-mediated changes in gastric mucosa and delayed gastric emptying cause vomiting. It is a noninvasive virus and does not cause invasion of the colon; therefore leukocytes or erythrocytes in the feces are typically absent. No histopathological lesions are seen in the gastric mucosa. Host immunity Norwalk virus infection confers a brief and short immunity. Recurrent infection occurs throughout life, because of the absence of long-term immunity, lack of cross-strain immunity, and because of the diversity of Norwalk virus strains. Clinical Syndromes Norwalk viruses cause gastroenteritis in adults. The illness in symptomatic cases typically begins after an incubation period of 24-48 hours. The illness is characterized by sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. It is accompanied by low-grade fever, abdominal cramps, and myalgia. Fecal leuko-cytes are absent. Norwalk virus gastroenteritis is short-lived and typically lasts for 24-48 hours. Epidemiology Norwalk virus gastroenteritis is found worldwide in adults. It is a strict human infection, and humans are the major source of infection. The virus is excreted in the vomitus and feces for several weeks after recovery; hence vomitus and feces are important sources of infection. Infection is transmitted from person to person by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the virus. The infection typically occurs in group settings, such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, etc. Laboratory Diagnosis Immunoelectron microscopy is used to detect the virus in the stool. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) or ELISA are also used to detect the virus and viral antigen in the stool. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also being evaluated to demonstrate viral genome in the stool for diagnosis of the cases. Both ELISA and RIA are the serodiagnostic tests frequently used to detect specific antibodies to Norwalk virus in the serum. Chap-70.indd 585 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70586 VIROLOGY Treatment No specific treatment is available for Norwalk virus. Prevention and Control No vaccine is available against the virus. Strict personal hygiene, such as hand washing is useful to prevent the transmission of the disease. Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Most viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are caused by 12 distinct enveloped RNA viruses that belong to four families: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, and Flaviviridae. The manifestations of the disease vary depending upon the agent causing the disease. Circulatory dysfunction, increased vascu-lar permeability, and diffuse hemorrhage, however, are the serious and terminal manifestations of the disease. With recog-nition of outbreak of infection caused by Ebola virus near the city of Kikwik, Zaire (Africa), the condition has now received worldwide attention. Viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by differ-ent viruses show following features: 1. Viral agents are usually arthropod-borne. Mosquitoes are primarily responsible for transmitting the disease. 2. P erson-to-person transmission may occur in many VHFs by direct contact with inf ected patients, their blood, or their secretions and excretions. 3. Rats and mice are the usual animal reservoirs for many of the VHFs. How ever, domestic livestock, monkeys, and other primates may also serve as intermediate hosts. 4. In this condition, hemorrhage is typically present in many organs, and ef fusions are common in serous cavities. Widespread necrosis may be present in any organ system, and varies from modest and focal to mas-sive in extent. Liver and lymphoid systems are usually involved. Ebola and Marburg are two most important causative agents of VHFs with a mortality of 25-100%. Both viruses are found in Africa and possibly in Philippines. Zaire subtype of Ebola virus has been associated with a high rate of infection, especially in Zaire, Africa. Ebola infection during pregnancy has been con-sistently fatal. The vector responsible for transmission of Ebola virus is not known, but infected primates appear to be respon-sible. Later close contact among humans or primates appears to spread the infection. Aerosol transmission is suggested to occur in monkeys. Incubation period of Ebola and Marburg infection varies from 2 to 14 days. Symptoms are nonspecific. An insidious or sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, generalized myal-gias and arthralgias, headache, anorexia, and cough are some of the common symptoms. The condition may also be associated with sore throat, epigastric pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.Key Points ELISA for virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the test of choice for diagnosis of VHFs. The test, however, is negative during the acute stages of Marburg and Ebola virus infections. Electron microscopy and enzyme immunoassay are the sensitive and specific assays for direct detection of specific viral antigen in blood and tissues. PCR on serum is very useful for detection of infection during the acute stages of infection during which antibodies are not demonstrated in the serum. No specific antiviral agents are available for the treatment for Ebola or Marburg virus. Avoidance of insect bites from the vectors and that of exposure to rodent sources of infection is the most important measure for preventing the condition. Barrier nursing and needle sterilization in African hospitals are important to eliminate epidemics of Ebola and Marburg diseases. Arenavirus Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a helical nucleocapsid. They are spherical to pleomorphic in shape varying in size from 50 to 300 nm. The lipid envelope contains two major glycopro-tein components gp1 and gp2, which appear as spike-like or club-like projections. The name arena means sand that refers to granules at the surface of the virion that are nonfunctional ribosomes. The arenaviruses include lymphocytic such as the Lassa, Junin, and Machupo virus. Properties of the Virus Morphology Arenaviruses show following features: Arenaviruses are the pleomorphic, enveloped viruses (50-300 nm) that have a sandy appearance. The genome is a negative-sense RNA that contains two subgenomic segments, namely, S (small segment, measuring 1.3 million bases) and L (large segment, measuring 2.4 million bases). The virion consists of beaded nucleocapsid with two single-stranded RNA circles. The strand is a negative-sense RNA that encodes for a Z protein and for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The segment encodes for the glycoprotein precursors and for the N protein that binds to the positive-sense RNA segments. The presence of internal granular structures 20-25 nm in size is the distinctive property of arenavirus. These granular structures on electron microscopy appear sand-like. These structures are believed to be host-cell-derived ribosomes, which are incorporated into the virus during budding. These struc-tures do not appear to play any role in replication of viruses. Chap-70.indd 586 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70MISCELLANEOUS VIRUSES 587 Viral Isolation The arenavirus, such as Lassa virus, can be isolated in cell culture using the E6 clone of Vero cells or in suckling mice. Pathogenesis and Immunity Arenaviruses primarily infect macrophages and cause the vas-cular damage. Pathogenesis of arenaviruses infection is largely attributed to T-cell immunopathogenesis. T-cell-induced immunopathogenic effect contributes to the exacerbation of Syndromes Arenaviruses cause the following diseases: Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus causes lymphocytic cho-riomeningitis. This is a benign infection, which usually begins with fever, myalgia, and headache. The illness can be biphasic. Fever and more severe headache may recur 2-4 days after recov-ery from the first phase. Lassa fever Most infections caused by Lassa fever virus are mild or subclini-cal. The incubation period varies from 7 to 18 days. The infec-tion begins insidiously with fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, and severe headache. Prostration, dehydration, abdominal pain, facial or neck edema may be seen in severe cases. South American hemorrhagic fever Lassa, Junin, and Machupo viruses cause South American hemorrhagic fever, which are similar in severity. This has an insidious onset with fever, malaise, myalgia, and lumbar pain. A petechial and/or vesicular palatal enanthem and skin pete-chiae are found in many patients. The condition may prog-ress within 3-4 days with prostration and remitting fever and mucosal bleeding. Gingival hemorrhage is the characteristic feature. Most patients improve after 1-2 weeks, but one-third of patients may show many complications. These complica-tions include profound mucocutaneous and mucosal hemor-rhages, delirium, and convulsions. Epidemiology Geographical distribution Most arenaviruses with exception of lymphocytic chorio-meningitis viruses are found in Africa and South America. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection Most of arenaviruses are zoonotic and disease is transmitted primarily from rodents to humans. These viruses cause infec-tion in specific rodent species and are endemic in the areas that are inhabited by rodent species. The viruses that cause chronic infection in these animals are excreted in saliva, urine, and feces over a very long period of time. Humans usually acquire infec-tion from these animals through: inhalation of infectious aerosols of dried excreta, especially urine of the rodents that has been passed in the soil. ingestion of food contaminated with rodent feces or urine, or contact of the abraded skin with rodent blood or serum. The infections are not usually transmitted by the bite of rodents. The LCM viruses are distributed in Europe, Australia, Japan, and the Americas. This infection in this area is closely related with presence of infection in common mouse, such as Mus musculus and Mus homisticus. The mice are the most important reservoir of infection for humans. Hamsters are important res-ervoirs for pet owners and laboratory workers. Lassa fever is the disease of West Africa. The outbreaks of Lassa fever have been reported from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The rodents of the genus Mastomys are the reservoirs of infection. The infection is transmitted from these infected mice to humans. The infection can also be transmitted from humans to humans. South American hemorrhagic fever is caused by viruses Junin, Machupo, and Guanarito, which are endemic in Argentina, Bolivia, and Venezuela, respectively. The rodent Calomys mus-culinus is the main reservoir for Argentine hemorrhagic fever. These rodents, which are found commonly in the corn field, transmit the virus to farmers harvesting the corn. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of infectious aerosols. The infec-tion can also be transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food and also by direct contact of blood or tissue from rodents on the abraded finger. The rodent Calomys callosus is the major reservoir for Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, which transmits infection to humans. Transmission of infection occurs through these rodents by inhalation of aerosols from infected organisms and also by ingestion of food contaminated by rodent urine. The cane mouse is the main reservoir for Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever. Laboratory Diagnosis There is a great risk for laboratory workers in handling body fluids for diagnosis. Hence, it is mandatory to process the spec-imen only in facilities with biosafety level 4 for Lassa fever and other arenaviruses and biosafety level 3 for LCM virus. Specimens The specimens include blood and CSF. Isolation of the virus The virus can be isolated easily from blood of the individuals suffering from LCM virus infection and also from the CSF of the individuals developing meningitis. South American hemorrhagic fever viruses can be isolated from blood or tissue using tissue culture or suckling mice. Lassa virus can be Chap-70.indd 587 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70588 VIROLOGY cultured in tissue culture using the E6 clone of Vero cells or in suckling mice. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis is the most important method for establishing the diagnosis of arenavirus infection in humans. Key Points Both ELISA and indirect fluorescent antibody tests are used to demonstrate IgM antibodies in the serum in South American hemorrhagic fever. In this condition, the antibodies appear during the third week of disease. Antigen capture ELISA is used to detect antigens in blood and tissues for early diagnosis of South American hemorrhagic fever. IgM ELISA is frequently used for detection of antibodies in the serum as well as CSF for the diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Treatment Ribavirin is the antiviral drug used for the treatment of Lassa fever and also for South American hemorrhagic fever. The treatment is mostly supportive to maintain fluid and electro-lyte balance, which can be lifesaving. Prevention and Control The prevention of rodent-borne arenavirus infection depends on the rodent control measures and avoidance of high- density rodent-infested areas. No vaccines are available against arenaviruses. Clinical trials of attenuated Junin virus are in progress. Coronaviruses Coronaviruses were so named for the crown-like appearance of their virions on electron microscopy. These viruses are the second most important cause of the common cold; rhinovi-ruses being the first cause. The coronaviruses have also been reported to cause gastroenteritis in children and adults. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly described coronavirus in 2002. The virus causes an atypical pneumonia called SARS, a serious and potentially life-threatening viral infection of humans. SARS-CoV causing atypical pneumonia called severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS was first reported in 2002 and 2003 outbreak. This outbreak caused by the virus is believed to have originated in Guangdong province, south China. It predominantly affected mainly China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Subsequently, this outbreak spread to neighboring countries in Asia, Canada, and the United States.Properties of the Virus Morphology Coronaviruses show following features: Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses measuring 80-160 nm in size on electron microscopy. The glycoproteins appear as club-shaped projections (20 nm long and 5-11 nm wide) on surface of the envelope. The genome in association with N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid. The virus contains the glycoproteins E1 and E2 and a core nucleoprotein N. Some strains also contain a glycoprotein E3, which is a SARS-CoV is a single-stranded, nonsegmented, plus-sense RNA virus. It measures approximately 30 kb in length. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV is different from other corona-virus strains. These strains of SARS-CoV are quite stable unlike other coronaviruses in which mutations in the RNA sequence during replication of virus are common. Such mutations contribute to the appearance of new virus to be either more or less virulent. In contrast, the genome sequence of different isolates of SARS-CoV is very similar. Viral isolation The attachment of the virus to the cell is mediated by hemag-glutinin. The virus enters the cell and uncoats. The replication of the virus occurs in cytoplasm. Synthesis of protein occurs in two stages similar to that of togaviruses. In the first stage, the viral genome is transcribed to produce an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Subsequently, the polymerase produces a negative-sense template RNA. This template RNA is utilized by the N protein to produce new viral genomes and individual messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding other viral proteins. The assembly of viruses occurs and derives its envelope from the endoplasmic reticulum but not from the plasma membrane. Antigenic and genomic structure Coronaviruses have two serotypes, namely, 229E and OC43. SARS virus is relatively stable. Other properties The coronaviruses are sensitive to acid, ether, and bile. Virus isolation The coronaviruses are difficult to grow in routine cell cultures. Pathogenesis and Immunity The coronaviruses are confined strictly to the mucosal cells of the respiratory tract. These viruses typically cause infections in the upper respiratory tract, because the optimal temperature Chap-70.indd 588 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70MISCELLANEOUS VIRUSES 589 for replication of viruses is 37-38\u00b0C. The envelope contains (a) E2 viral attachment protein, (b) E1 matrix protein, and (c) N1 nucleocapsid protein. Early phase of the infection pro-duces RNA polymerase (E); late phase produces structural and nonstructural proteins from a negative-sense RNA template. SARS-CoV causes infection in the respiratory tract by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on the surface of respiratory epithelium. This causes alteration in fluid balance and leads to development of edema in alveolar space. Diffuse edema resulting in hypoxia is characteristic of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV. Infections caused by coronaviruses produce a short and brief immunity, but reinfection can occur. Clinical Syndromes Coronaviruses cause following syndromes: (a) common cold, (b) gastroenteritis, and (c) SARS. Common cold The coronaviruses (229E and OC43) cause more commonly upper respiratory tract, and less commonly, lower respiratory tract illnesses in humans. Common cold caused by coronaviruses has an incubation period of 3 days. The condition is characterized by rhinorrhea, sore throat, and low-grade fever. The condition typically lasts for several days. Gastroenteritis The coronaviruses have also been reported to cause gastroen-teritis in children and adults. The symptoms are mild, and the condition is self-limiting. SARS SARS is a potentially life-threatening infection associated with the onset of flu-like syndrome, which may progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and in some cases death. The incubation period varies from 2 to 7 days, although it may be as long as 2 weeks. Flu-like prodrome is the first stage of the disease, which is characterized by fever (/H11022 30\u00b0C), fatigue, chills, malaise, anorexia, and myalgia. Second stage represents the lower respiratory tract illness that begins three or more days after incubation. Hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, and breathing difficulties are common find-ings. The cough typically tends to be dry and nonproductive and may range from mild to severe. Fever is typically higher than 30\u00b0C. Chest X ray shows interstitial ground glass infil-trates that do not show cavitation. The condition is associated with lymphadenopathy and thrombocytopenia. Morbidity and mortality due to SARS is more in elderly population and also seen in more individuals with coexisting chronic illness and immunosuppression. The mortality rate of SARS is higher than influenza and other respiratory tract illnesses. The overall mortality is more than 10% and is more than 50% in elderly individuals above 65 years.Epidemiology SARS is restricted in its geographical distribution. Geographical distribution The SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 predominantly affected mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Canada. The SARS strain is believed to have originated in Guangdong province in southern China. The disease is epidemiologically linked to the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, where the outbreak is thought to have originated. A total of 8098 cases, 774 deaths, and 7324 recoveries from SARS were docu-mented between November 2002 and April 21, 2004. Reservoir, source, and transmission of infection SARS is believed to be primarily transmitted by close person-to-person contact. Most cases of SARS were seen in indi-viduals who lived with or cared for a patient with SARS or who had exposure to contaminated secretions from a SARS patient. The infection would possibly have been acquired by inhalation of infectious droplets during the act of coughing or sneezing, from a SARS patient. Moreover, another possible mode of transmission is direct contact of the eyes, nose, or mouth of susceptible individuals with infectious secretions of SARS patients. Key Points It is suggested that SARS-CoV may have originated in chickens, ducks, or small mammals. In these animals, the virus would have mutated, subsequently being transmitted, thereby causing infection in humans. The transmission to humans is facilitated possibly by the proximity in which humans and livestock live in rural southern China. The avian flu epidemic in Hong Kong in 1977, which originated in poultry and spread to humans (resulting in the slaughter of millions of chickens), is a classical example of this type of zoonotic transmission. It is also postulated that the SARS-CoV initially originated in civet cats, which were sold in a Guangdong marketplace in rural southern China as a food delicacy. Close contact with their saliva or feces, or with the animals themselves, possibly has transmitted a mutated SARS-CoV to humans. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnostic tests are most essential to confirm diag-nosis of the SARS. Specimens Specimens include respiratory secretions for isolation of virus, and serum for testing of antibodies. Chap-70.indd 589 5/14/2012 12:58:33 PMSection IV Chapter 70590 VIROLOGY Isolation of the virus SARS-CoV can be isolated in viral cultures. Isolation of virus is attempted only in class III laboratories. Serodiagnosis Serodiagnosis of SARS depends on detection of specific anti-bodies to SARS-CoV in serum obtained during acute illness or 28 days and more after the onset of disease. IFA and ELISAs are the most frequently used tests for detection of specific antibodies in patients with SARS. Demonstration of a four-fold rise of antibody titer between acute and convalescent (/H1102228 days after symptom onset) serum samples is suggestive of SARS. Molecular Diagnosis Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is employed for detection of SARS-CoV RNA in serum, stool, and nasal secretions. The test is positive in some patients within the first 10 days of fever. Treatment No specific antiviral treatment is available against SARS. Treatment is mostly symptomatic as given for a serious com-munity-acquired pneumonia. Prevention and Control Isolation of patient and strict barrier nursing is crucial to prevent transmission of SARS to others. Moreover, airport screening for potentially sick and/or febrile passengers is being carried out in SARS-affected regions in Asia by using infrared scanners. These scanners identify potentially febrile passen-gers by measuring their body heat. The software in the scan-ner is color-coded in temperature ranges; as skin temperature increases, the colors on the scanner change, such as black to green to yellow and, finally, to red. Any individual with a skin temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or greater glows bright red on the scan-ner. This, however, shows a lot of false-positive reactions, as many other noninfectious conditions (sunburn, ingestion of alcoholic beverages, recent cigarette smoking, or brisk exercise, etc.) can cause an increase in the skin temperature. A group of medical college students went for dining in a hotel on the last day of their final university examination. After 2 days of dining in the hotel, all of them complained of mild fever, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. The symptoms lasted only for 24 hours. The symptoms were not suggestive of bacterial gastroenteritis or food poisoning. What is the most likely viral etiology of the condition? How is this viral agent transmitted? What are the laboratory tests used for establishing the diagnosis of the condition? How can you prevent the condition?CASE Leprae43 71 Introduction Mycology is the study of fungi. The name \"fungi\" is derived from \"mykos\" meaning mushroom. The fungi are eukaryotic organisms and they differ from the bacteria, which are prokaryotic organisms, in many ways (Table 71-1). The fungi possess rigid cell walls, which possess two characteristic cell structures: chitin and ergosterol.Chitin: The fungi consist primarily of chitin, unlike pepti-doglycan present in cell wall of bacteria. Hence, fungi are not sensitive to action of penicillin and other antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. Chitin is a polysaccharide consisting of long chains of N-acetylglucosamine. In addition to chitin, the fungal cell wall also contains mannan and other polysac-charides. Of these, beta-glucan is most important, because it is the target of antifungal drug caspofungin.Ergosterol: The cell membrane of fungus contains ergosterol, unlike human cell membrane which contains cholesterol. The antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B, fluconazole, and ketoconazole have selective action on the fungi due to this basic difference in membrane sterols. Classification of Fungi The fungi can be classified as follows: Taxonomical Classification The fungi are placed in the phylum Thallophyta. There are four classes of fungi: and Deuteromycetes or Fungi Imperfecti.Introduction to Mycology Feature Fungi Bacteria Diameter Approximately 4 /H9262m Approximately 1 /H9262m Morphology Yeast with PAS and GMS Gram-positive, Gram-negative, acid fast Cell wall content Chitin Peptidoglycan Cell membrane Sterols present Sterols Spores Sexual and asexual spores for reproduction Endospores for survival, not for reproduction Thermal dimorphism Yes (seen in some fungi) No PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; GMS, Gomori's methenamine silver.TABLE 71-1 Comparison of fungi and bacteriaMorphological Classification The fungi can be classified into the following four main groups based upon the morphology: (a) yeast, (b) yeast-like form, (c) molds, and (d) dimorphic fungi. Key Points Yeast: Yeasts are round or oval unicellular fungi that reproduce by asexual budding. On culture medium, such as Sabouraud's dextrose agar they produce creamy mucoid colonies. pseudohyphae. Candida albicans.Molds: Molds grow as long filaments called hyphae. They usually measure 2-10 /H9262 m in width. Some hyphae form transverse walls and hence they are called septate hyphae, whereas others do not produce walls, hence are called nonseptate hyphae. Nonseptate hyphae are multinucleated. The hyphae on their continuous growth form a mat known as mycelium. The part of the mycelium that projects above the surface in culture medium is called aerial mycelium. Examples include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, etc.Dimorphic fungi: Many of medically important fungi are dimorphic. They exist as hyphal/mycelial forms in the soil and in the cultures at 22-25\u00b0C. They occur as yeasts or other structures in human tissue and in the culture at 37\u00b0C (Fig. of Fungi Fungi can reproduce sexually by forming sexual spores and asexually by forming conidia or asexual spores. sporangiospores, (b) coni-diospores, (c) microconidia, and (d) macroconidia. Sporangiospores are spores formed within a sac called spo-rangium, which develops at the ends of the hyphae called sporangiophores (e.g., Mucor and Rhizopus). Conidiospores, or otherwise called conidia, are spores found externally on the sides or tips of hyphae. Conidia can be macroconidia are small and single. Pathogenesis Most fungi are obligate aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but none are obligate anaerobes. The natural habitat of most fungi is environment, because all these fungi require a preformed organic source of carbon, hence their constant association with decaying matter. C. albicans is exception and is an important fungus, which is a part of the normal human flora. Fungi are ubiquitous in nature, i.e., they occur as free-living saprobes, hence determining their role in human infection may sometimes be difficult. The effects of fungi on humans can be grouped in three major ways as follows: (a) colonization and disease, (b) hypersensitive diseases, and (c) diseases caused by mycotoxins or fungal toxins. Colonization and Disease Most fungal infections are mild and self-limited. Intact skin is an effective host defense against certain fungi. But if the skin is broken, organisms, the fungi enter through that broken skin and initiate the infection. Fatty acid content, pH, epithelial turnover, and normal bacterial flora of the skin contribute to host resistance against fungi. For example, the mucous mem-brane of the nasopharynx traps inhaled fungal spores. Cell-mediated immunity is much important in conferring protection against fungi. Suppression of cell-mediated immu-nity can lead to reactivation and dissemination of asymptom-atic fungal infection and to diseases caused by opportunistic fungi. The humoral immunity is mediated by production of IgG and IgM antibody. But their role in protection from fungal disease is uncertain.Saprobic phase (25\u00b0C) Parasitic basidiospores 71-2). are formed in a sac called ascus, whereas basidiospores are formed outside on the tip of a pedestal called a basidium. Zygospores are single, large spores with thick wall. The fungi that do not produce sexual spores are called imper-fect and are classified as Fungi imperfecti. Asexual spores are produced by mitosis. Fungi reproduce asexually by forming conidia. The shape, color, and arrangement of the conidia are helpful for identification of the fungi. Asexual spores can be vegetative or aerial spores as follows:A. Vegetative spores: These include (a) arthrospores, (b) chla- mydospores, and (c) blastospores. Arthrospores are formed by fragmentations of the ends of hyphae, resulting in rectangular thick-walled spores. The arthrospores are the infective stage of C. immitis. Chlamydospores arise by rounding and thickening of hyphal segments. They are round and thick walled. The terminal chlamydospores help in the identification of C. albicans. Blastospores are formed by budding process from par-ent cells, such as yeast. Some yeasts, such as C. albicans can form multiple buds that do not detach from the parent yeast, thus producing elongated structures called pseudohyphae. Fungal infection that occurs in the immunocompromised hosts is called as opportunistic mycosis. If such conditions are not rapidly diagnosed and immediately managed, they can prove to be life-threatening. Hypersensitivity Diseases Humans are continually exposed to air-borne fungal spores and other fungal elements present in the environment. These spores can be antigenic stimulants and depending on individual's immunological status may induce a state of hypersensitivity by of immunoglobulins or sensitized lymphocytes. Rhinitis, bronchial asthma, alveolitis, and various forms of atopy are the clinical manifestations of hypersensitive pneumo-nitis. The clinical manifestations of the hypersensitivity disease are seen only in sensitized person, after repeated exposure to the fungus, fungal metabolites, or other cross-reactive materials. Allergies to the fungal spores are manifested primarily by an asthmatic reaction including rapid bronchial constriction mediated by IgE, eosinophilia, and positive hypersensitivity skin test reaction. These are caused due to immediate hyper-sensitivity reactions of the host to fungal spores. Diseases Caused by Fungal Toxins Mycotoxicosis is ingested fungal toxins. eating amanita mushroom is the best exam-ple of mycotoxicosis. This group of fungi produces five toxins. Of these, amanitine and phalloidin are the two most potent hep-atotoxins. The toxicity of amanitine is due to its ability to inhibit cellular RNA polymerase, which prevents mRNA synthesis. Aflatoxin is another fungal toxin produced by Aspergillus flavus that causes disease in humans. Aflatoxin-B causes a mutation in the P53 tumor-suppressor gene, resulting in a loss of P53 protein, thereby in a resultant loss of growth control in the hepatocytes. Hence, it causes damage to liver, and it induces tumor in liver in animals and is associated with hepatic carci-nomas in humans. Claviceps purpurea is a mold that infects brain and produces alkaloids, such as ergotamine and lysergic acid diethyl amide. These compounds cause serious vascular and neurological effects. Yellow rice toxicosis in Japan and elementary toxic aleu- kia in the former Soviet Union are the examples of other mycotoxicoses. The transmission and habitat of some important fungi in India are described in Table 71-2.Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of fungal infections depends on: (a) direct microscopy, (b) culture, (c) serological tests, (d ) non- culture methods, and (e) molecular methods. Direct Microscopy Direct microscopic examination depends on demonstration of characteristic asexual spores, hyphae, or yeast in various clini-cal specimens by light microscopy. The commonly used clinical specimens are sputum, lung biopsy material, and skin scrapings. The specimen is either treated with 10% KOH or stained with special fungal stains. Use of 10% KOH dissolves tissue material, leaving the alkali-resistant fungi intact. Calcofluor dye is a fluorescent dye that combines with fungal cell wall and is useful in identification of fungi in tissue specimens. Methenamine silver stain is useful for demonstra-tion of fungi in tissues. India ink preparation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a useful method for demonstration of white cap-sule of C. neoformans in CSF. Gram staining is also useful to demonstrate Gram-positive Candida species in the specimen. The disadvantages of microscopy are that it shows low sensitivity and requires an experienced microscopist for specific identification. Culture Fungal culture is a frequently used method for confirming the diagnosis of fungal infection. SDA is the most commonly used medium for fungal culture. Other media include CHROM agar, blood agar, etc. The low pH of the medium and addition of chloramphenicol and cycloheximide to the medium inhibit the growth of bacteria in the specimen and thereby facilitate the appearance of slow-growing fungi. Fungal colony is identified by rapidity of growth, color, and morphology of the colony at the obverse and pigmentation at the reverse. Microscopy of the fungal colony is carried out in lactophe- nol cotton blue (LPCB) mount to study the morphology of hyphae, spores, and other structures. The appearance of the mycelium and the nature of the asexual spores are very much helpful to identify the fungus. Culture, however, is time-consuming in most cases and also the yield is not very good. Culture following lysis of the Fungi Habitat Form transmitted Portal of entry Cryptococcus Soil (pigeon feces) Yeast Inhalation into lungs Aspergillus Soil and vegetation Conidia Inhalation into lungs Candida Human body Yeast Normal of skin, mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina Rhinosporidium seeberi Fresh marneffei Soil Conidia Inhalation of conidiaTABLE 71-2 Transmission and habitat of some important fungi in India Chap-71.indd 595 5/14/2012 1:17:47 PMSection V Chapter 71596 MYCOLOGY specimens, such as blood, obviates this problem. Blood lysed by addition of certain substances, followed by centrifuga-tion, increases yield of fungi by culture. Yield can be fur-ther increased with a shortening of time by combining with BACTEC systems. Serological Tests Demonstration of the antibodies in patient's serum or CSF is useful for diagnosis of fungal infections, especially in sys-temic fungal infections. A significant rise of antibody titer in a paired sera sample confirms the diagnosis. The complement fixation test was the earliest test used in fungal serology and is still used in the diagnosis of suspected cases of histoplasmo-sis, blastomycosis, or coccidiomycosis. Recently, newer tests like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), Western blot, and radioimmunoassays are increasingly used for serodi-agnosis of fungal infections. Nonculture Methods These methods include (a) detection of fungal antigen, (b) detection of fungal cell wall markers, and ( c) detection of fungal metabolites. Antigen detection: It is useful in immunocompromised hosts where antibody detection is not as sensitive. Detection of fun-gal antigen in serum, CSF, and urine is increasingly used for diagnosis of many fungal infections. Demonstration of antigen indicates recent or active infection. Latex agglutination test is a frequently used test to demonstrate polysaccharide capsular antigen of C. neoformans in CSF for diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. False-positive Mannan is a highly immunogenic component of the candidal cell wall. Mannan antigen detection, therefore, is most widely used method in the diagnosis of candidiasis. Galactomannan is a heat-stable heteropolysaccharide found in the cell walls of all Aspergillus species. Production of the galactomannan antigen is proportional to fungal load in tis-sue, hence is being used as the prognostic marker for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A sandwich ELISA using rat monoclo-nal antibody EB-A2 against galactomannan antigen is being currently used in Europe for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Most pathogenic fungi have 1, 3-beta- D-glucan in their cell walls and minute quantities are secreted into the circulation during the life cycle. Detection of this antigen can also be used as an indicator of invasive fungal infections. Detection of 1, 3-beta- D-glucan is based on its ability to activate a coagulation cascade within amebocytes derived from the hemolymph of horseshoe crabs. This uses a different cascade than endotoxin to cause coagulation, hence is specific for fungi. The test does not detect certain species, such as C. neoformans and Zygomycetes.Detection of fungal metabolites: Detection of distinctive fungal metabolites is another approach for the diagnosis of fungal infections. Gas liquid chromatography is being used to quantify arabinitol for diagnosis of C. albicans infections. Molecular Diagnosis DNA probes are the recent techniques, which are very useful to identify colonies growing in culture at an earlier stage of growth. These DNA probes are very useful for rapid diagnosis of these cultures in comparison to traditional methods of visual detection of colonies. DNA probes are now available for detection of Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides. Mitochondrial DNA has been used for the diagnosis of C. albicans and Aspergillus species. Antifungal Drugs A few drugs are available for therapy of systemic fungal infection, unlike a large number of antibiotics available to treat bacterial infections. The drugs used to treat bacterial disease have no effect on fungal diseases. Amphotericin B and various azoles are the most effective antifungal drugs. They act on the ergosterol of fungal cell membrane that is not found in bacterial or human cell membrane. Similarly, caspo-fungin inhibits synthesis of beta-glucan, which is found only in fungal membrane but not in bacterial or human cell mem-brane. Table 71-3 summarizes the common antifungal agents and their primary sites of activity. Group of compoundsAntifungal agent Mechanism of 5/14/2012 1:17:47 PM72 Introduction Fungal infections, depending on the tissues that are initially colonized, can be classified into three major groups as follows:Superficial mycoses: These are surface infections of the skin, affecting the outermost layers of skin, hair, and mucosa.Cutaneous mycoses: These are infections of the skin involv- ing the epidermis and its integuments, the hair, and nails.Subcutaneous mycoses: These are infections of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and fascia. Superficial Mycoses Superficial mycosis caused by different fungi is restricted to the outermost layers of the skin and hair. The condition usually causes cosmetic problem, which can be easily diag-nosed and treated. It includes four important conditions: (a) (b ) or tinea versicolor is caused Malassezia furfur ( Pityrosporum orbiculare). M. furfur requires fatty is cultured on the Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) overlayed with a layer of olive oil. On incubation at 37\u00b0C, the fungus produces creamy colonies within 5-7 days. The lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) wet mount of these colonies shows budding yeast cell along with a number of bottle-shaped cells. The fungus is found in parts of the body rich in sebaceous glands. The lesions of pity-riasis versicolor are found most commonly on the upper tissue, arms, and abdomen. They appear as hypopigmented macu-lar lesions often associated with slight scaling or itching. The condition is mostly asymptomatic. It occurs most frequently in hot and humid weather. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is usually made by demonstration of both budding yeast cell and hyphae in KOH preparation of skin scrapings. Characteristic \"spaghetti and meatballs\" appearance of fungus is demonstrated in the microscopy of KOH preparation of the skin. Culture is not carried out routinely for diagnosis. Topical miconazole is treatment of choice.Tinea Nigra Tinea nigra is an infection of keratinized caused by Exophiala werneckii or Cladosporium werneckii. C. werneckii is a dimorphic fungus that produces melanin. The fungus on the SDA grows as yeast with many cells in various stages of cell divi-sion producing typical two-celled oval structure, on primary isolation from clinical specimen. On prolonged incubation, elongated hyphae develop and in older cultures, mycelia are predominantly found. A well-demarcated brown-black macular lesion, which appears as brownish spot of the skin, is typical manifestation of the condition. These brownish to black lesions are most commonly seen on palms and soles. Laboratory diagnosis of tinea nigra is made by microscopy of the KOH preparation of skin scrapings collected from the affected part. Typical darkly pigmented yeast-like cells and hyperfragmented hyphae are demonstrated. Culture of the skin scraping on the SDA confirms the diagnosis. Black Piedra Black piedra is a superficial infection of the hair caused by Piedraia hortae, a dematiaceous fungus. The fungus occurs in the perfect state when it colonizes the shaft of hairs. Culture of specimens on SDA shows slow-growing brown to reddish black mycelium, which is considered asexual or anamorphic stage of the fungus. The teleomorphic state, which is the perfect state of the fungus, is occasionally found in old cultures. At this state asci, which contain spindle-shaped ascospores, develop within specialized structures. Infection of shaft of hairs of beard and scalp is the major clinical feature of black piedra. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by demonstration of nodules containing asci with spindle-shaped ascospores in 10% KOH mount of the hair. White Piedra White piedra is an infection of the hair caused by yeast-like organism Trichosporon beigelli. The fungus can be grown on SDA and other media containing cycloheximide. On SDA, it forms green-colored colonies, which subsequently become yellow-ish gray and wrinkled. Microscopic examination of the colony shows septate hyphae that break rapidly to form arthroco-nidia. The latter subsequently become round and develop to and White piedra is commonly found in South America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Japan. The hair of scalp, moustache, and beard are commonly affected in white piedra. The development of a soft, pasty, cream-colored growth along infected hair shaft characterizes the condition. The initial growth of T. beigelli occurs beneath the epidermis of hair. The infected hair shaft consists of mycelium that rapidly fragments to arthroconidia. Laboratory diagnosis of the condition is made by demon- stration of fragmented hyphae that develop into arthroconidia or produce blastoconidia in 10% KOH mount of hair. Culture of the fungus from clinical specimen confirms the diagnosis. Features of the organisms causing superficial mycoses are summarized in Table 72-1. Cutaneous Mycoses Dermatophytoses or cutaneous mycoses are diseases of the skin, hair, and nail. These infections are caused by a homogeneous group of closely related fungi known as dermatophytes. These dermatophytes infect only superficial keratinized structures, such as skin, hair, and nail, but not deeper tissues. Dermatophytes The most important dermatophytes that cause infection in humans are classified into the following three genera: (i) Trichophyton\u2014causes infection of hair , skin, and nail. (ii) Microsporum\u2014causes infection of hair and skin. (iii) Epidermoph yton\u2014causes infection of skin and nails, but no t hair (Fig. 72-1). The dermatophytes on the basis of their natural habitat and host preferences can be classified into following groups: (i) Anthropophilic species: These dermatoph ytes are typically adapted to live on human host. They are trans-mitted from human to human through fallen hairs, desquamated epithelium, combs, hair brushes, towels, etc. nii, are the dermatophytes that liv e on animals and often cause infection in their animal host. These zoophilic species are transmitted from infected ani-mals to humans by direct and indirect contacts with domes-tic animals (e.g., cat and dog) and occasionally wild animals. Examples are Trichophyton violaceum and Microsporum canis. (iii) Geophilic species: These are saprophytic fungi f ound in soil or in dead organic substances. They occasionally cause infection in humans and animals. Examples are Microspo- rum gypseum and Trichophyton ajelloi. Dermatophytes usually grow only on keratinized skin and its appendages, and do not penetrate the living tissues. In some infected persons, hypersensitivity to fungus antigen may cause secondary eruptions, such as vesicles on the finger. This reaction is known as dermatophytid (id) reaction. This reaction occurs as a result of hypersensitivity response to circulating fungal antigen, and these lesions do not contain any fungal hyphae. Asexual state of selected dermatophytes is mentioned in Table 72-2. Clinical syndromes The skin infections caused by dermatophytes are chronic infections of the skin often found in the warm humid areas of the body, such as athlete's foot and jock itch. Typical ringworm lesions are circular, which have an inflamed border contain-ing papules and vesicles surrounding a clear area of relatively normal skin. These lesions are associated with variable degrees of scaling and inflammation. Broken hair and thickened broken nails are often seen in this lesion.Disease Organism Tissue Diagnosis Pityriasis versicolor Malassezia furfur appearance Tinea nigra Exophiala Skin Culture black and hyphae Black piedra Piedraia hortae Hair MYCOSES 599 Clinically, ringworm can be classified depending on the site affected. These are (a) Tinea capitis involving scalp, (b) Tinea corporis involving Tinea cruris affecting groin, (d) Tinea pedis affecting foot, and (e) Tinea barbae affecting beard areas of face and neck. Favus is a chronic ringworm infection affecting hair follicle. It leads to alopecia and scarring. Laboratory diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis is based on demonstration of fungal element in clinical specimen by microscopy and confirmation by culture. The specimens include skin scrapings and nail clip-pings or hair taken from the areas suspected to be infected by dermatophytes. These entire specimens are treated with alkali solution to clear epithelial cells and other debris. Direct micros-copy is useful only for diagnosis, while culture is always carried out to identify the specific causative fungal agent. Direct microscopy Examination of 10% direct KOH mount may show fungal hyphae. Three types of hair infections can be demonstrated in microscopy of 10% KOH wet mount as follows (Fig. 72-2):Ectothrix: Ectothrix infection is characterized by presence of a layer of arthrospores on the surface of hair shaft (Color Photo 60). It is caused by M. audouinii, M. canis, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.Endothrix: The clusters of arthrospores are found entirely within the hair shaft in endothrix infection (Color Photo 61). It is caused by Trichophyton tonsurans , T. violaceum, and Trichophyton schoenleinii.Favus: In favus, there is sparse hyphal growth and formation of air spaces within hair shaft. It is caused by T. violaceum, T. schoenleinii, and M. gypseum. Culture The clinical specimens are cultured by inoculation on SDA containing antibiotics like cycloheximide. The media after inoculation are incubated at 25-30\u00b0C for 3 weeks. At 25\u00b0C most of the pathogenic fungi grow well, while saprophytic fungi and bacteria are inhibited. The cultures are examined at regular intervals, and dermato- phytes are identified based on (a ) colony morphology, ( b) pigment production, and (c ) presence of microconidia and macroconidia. The LPCB preparation of the colonies shows microconidia, macroco-nidia, or both. Only macroconidia are present in the Epidermophyton infection. Few macroconidia and more microconidia are present in Trichophyton infection. Macroconidia are predominantly present in Microsporum infection. The differentiation of three genera is based mainly on the nature of macroconidia (Table 72-3; Fig. 72-3). Key Points Trichophyton: Colonies are powdery, velvety, or waxy with pigment characteristic of different species. Microconidia are abundant but macroconidia are very few. The microconidia are arranged in clusters along with hyphae and are pres-ent on tip of conidiophores. Some species may have special type of hyphae, such as spiral hyphae or racket hyphae, etc. Trichophyton species infect hairs, skin, and nails.Microsporum: Infects both skin and hair, but not the nails. They produce cottony, velvety, or powdery colonies with white-brown scanty but macro-conidia are abundant.Epidermophyton: Infects skin and nails but not hair. It pro-duces powdery and greenish yellow colonies. Macroconidia are numerous. The macroconidia are club-shaped, multiseptate, and are arranged in groups of two to three. Chlamydospores are numerous but microconidia are absent. Other tests Hair perforation test: This test is performed to differenti- ate T. rubrum from T. mentagrophytes. The test is also used to differentiate M. canis from Microsporum equinus. This test is per- formed by collecting 5-10 mm short shaft of human hair and placing it in a Petri dish with 20 mL of distilled water. Then, two to three drops of 10% sterile yeast extract is added to Chapter 72600 MYCOLOGY dish with hair shafts. These hair shafts are inoculated with test fungus cultured on SDA. The culture is incubated at 25\u00b0C for up to 1 month, during which the hairs are removed and LPCB mount of the hair is examined microscopically at weekly inter-vals for the demonstration of the perforation of hair. T. mentagrophytes (Color Photo 62) shows a positive hair perforation test characterized by a wedge-shaped perforation of the hair. This test is negative for T. rubrum in which only surface eruption of hair shaft is demonstrated.Urease test: Urease test is carried out to differentiate T. men- tagrophytes from T. rubrum. This test is performed by inocu-lating a tube of Christensen's medium with the fungus and incubating at 25\u00b0C for 5 days at room temperature. Most T. mentagrophytes are urease positive within 5 days.Growth on rice grains: This test is useful to differentiate M. canis from M. audouinii . In this test, sterile, nonfortified rice is inoculated with the hyphae of the fungi to be tested. The medium is observed for growth after 10 days of incubation at room temperature. M. canis usually grows well and forms many conidia on rice grain, whereas M. audouinii fails to grow. Treatment Treatment of dermatophyte infection is carried out by use of local antifungal drugs, such as miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, etc., orally Subcutaneous mycosis is defined as development of characteristic lesion in subcutaneous tissue and overlying skin with or without extension to bone and muscle. This is caused by a heterogeneous group of fungal infection of low pathogenic potential introduced in the body percutaneously from a trivial trauma. Table 72-4 shows the classification of subcutaneous mycoses. Mycetoma Mycetoma is a slowly progressive, chronic granulomatous infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues with occasional involvement of underlying fascia and bone usually affect-ing extremities. The condition is characterized by a triad of (a) tumefaction, (b) draining sinuses, and (c) grains or granules. The condition was described as early as in Atharva-Veda: padmavalmikam means anthill foot. John Gill first described the condition in Madurai (India) in 1842. Colebrook confirmed it in 1846. Henry Vandyke Carter, a professor at Grants Medical College, Mumbai, coined the term mycetoma in 1874. Chalmer and Christopherson coined the term maduramycosis in 1916. Mycetoma is caused by a number of actinomycetes and filamentous fungi that enter through penetrating injuries resulting from thorn pricks, splinters, etc (Table 72-5). Lower extremities are most commonly involved. Microabscesses are formed in subcutaneous tissues surrounded by polymor-phonuclear inflammatory reaction. The center of the lesion consists of tangled filaments of these organisms. During the course of infection, microabscesses burst open with the formation of chronic multiple sinuses discharging copi-ous, seropurulent fluid containing granules. The color and con-sistency of these granules vary depending on the fungi that cause the disease (Table 72-5). The condition is characterized by forma-tion of painless, localized, swollen lesions on the affected limbs. Multiple discharging sinuses are present. Discharge is purulent, mucopurulent, or serosanguinous and usually contains granules of varying size, color, and consistency. Fascia and bone may be affected but underlying tendons and nerves are never affected. The condition during period of time spreads slowly, but over years by contiguity. Sometimes the infection becomes extensive by involving buttock and trunk. Actinomycetes spread faster than eumycetes. Hematogenous spread is rare. MYCOSES 601 Mycetoma is documented worldwide but is common in tropical and subtropical countries. Actinomycetoma accounts nearly for 65% of mycetomas and for 35% of eumycetoma the major causative agent. Streptomyces somaliensis infection is seen more frequently in eastern India. The condition is more common in rural areas and in males (3.5:1) than females. It affects mostly highly active persons aged 20-40 years. It is an occupational hazard affect-ing farmers, herdsmen, carpenters, builders, land workers, field workers, etc. Mycotic mycetomas require surgical treatment by amputa- tion, while actinomycotic mycetomas are treated well by sulfon-amides and antibiotics. Key Points High index of clinical suspicion and proper history is essen-tial for clinical diagnosis of mycetoma. Laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstration of the fungi and fungal filaments in granules, pus, and biopsy tissue by microscopy. The granules on naked eye examination may be hard or soft, round or lobulated, and vary in size from 0.5 to 3 mm. These may be black, white to cream, or red. Microscopy of the granules may reveal very thin fungal fila-ments, measuring less than 1 /H9262m in diameters in cases of actinomycotic mycetomas. However, the fungal filaments may be broader and often show septate hyphae and chla-mydospores in caused dematiaceous fungi. Chromoblastomycosis Chromoblastomycosis is a slowly progressing granulomatous infection caused by several soil fungi. These are collectively called dematiaceous fungi because they have brown to black melanin pigment in their cell wall, and their conidia or hyphae are dark colored, either gray or black. All the fungi causing chromoblastomycosis appear morphologically similar in tissues stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) or other stains. The infection occurs following introduction of any of the dematiaceous fungi into the skin through trauma. The development of warty nodules that appear at site of inocula-tion characterizes chromoblastomycosis. During the course of infection, these lesions vegetate and develop to a cauliflower-like lesion. The disease is more common in tropical and subtropical countries. Key Points Laboratory diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis is made by demonstration of small clusters of round and dark brown, thick-walled cells (8-12 /H9262m) in tissues. The fungi are found in the dermis but are occasionally seen in the subcutaneous tissues. Direct KOH wet mount of skin is a rapid method for diagnosis of the condition by demonstrating these fungi in scales removed from surface of these lesions. In addition to these, copper-colored spherical cells in various stages of cell division are seen. These are the tissue forms of the fungus and called sclerotic or medullar bodies (Fig. 72-4) of the fungus. Phaeohyphomycosis Phaeohyphomycosis is a heterogeneous group of cuta-neous diseases caused by various dematiaceous fungi. Phaeohyphomycotic cyst is the most common form described in this condition. A wide number of dematiaceous fungi have been associated with various types of phaeohyphomyco-sis. Some of the common causes of phaeohyphomycosis are Bipolaris spicifera, pigmented, septate hyphae measuring 5-10 /H9262 m diameter in tissues. The drug of choice for treatment of chromoblastomycosis is 5-fluorocytosine. Cautery and surgical removal of early lesion is also useful. Sporotrichosis Sporotrichosis is a chronic pyogenic granulomatous lesion of the and subcutaneous tissue caused by Sporothrix schenckii. S. schenckii is a dimorphic fungus found all over the world. The fungus is found in soil, decaying woods, thorns, and on infected animals including rats, cats, dogs, and horses. FIG. 72-4. Sclerotic mother comes to dermatology with her 10-year-old child with complaints of scaly and patchy alopecia. On examination by a dermatologist, the condition was suspected to be tinea capitis. How will you confirm the diagnosis of tinea capitis? What are the clinical features of tinea fungi? How will you treat the condition?CASE STUDYSpore is the infective stage of the fungus. It causes infection primarily on the hand or the forearm through direct contact of the skin by spores. Typically, infection is introduced in skin through a penetration of thorn. At the site of thorn injury, it causes a local pustule or ulcer with the nodules along the drain-ing lymphatics. Frequently, the regional lymph nodes draining the ulcer enlarge, suppurate, and ulcerate. The primary lesion may remain localized or in the immu- nocompromised individuals may disseminate to involve the bones, joints, lung, and rarely the central nervous system. S. schenckii occurs in two phases. Yeast phase occurs in tissue and in culture at 37\u00b0C, while mycelium phase occurs in culture at 22-25\u00b0C. In infected tissue, the yeast appears as round, oval, or cigar- shaped cells with irregular borders. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stain is useful to demonstrate these structures in the stained smears. The fungus on SDA at 25\u00b0C produces black and shiny colonies, which become wrinkled and foggy during course of time. The mold contains hyphae bear-ing flower-like structures of small conidia on delicate sterigmata. Laboratory diagnosis of sporotrichosis is made by demon- stration of asteroid bodies in pus of the abscesses. Asteroid bodies consist of a central basophilic budding yeast cell with eosinophilic material, which radiates from the center. Key Points Isolation of the fungi by culture of ulcer exudates or pus aspi-rated from subcutaneous nodule or biopsy material confirms the diagnosis of sporotrichosis. LPCB wet mount of the col-ony shows thin, delicate hyphae bearing conidia occurring in a rosette pattern at the end of delicate conidiophores. Conidia are also demonstrated along the sides of the hyphae. Repeated subculture of mycelium of fungi on blood agar tubes at 37\u00b0C induces formation of yeast colonies. The LPCB wet mount of these colonies shows cigar-shaped yeast-like cells. Itraconazole is the drug of choice for treatment of the condition. Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. More than 90% of cases are reported from India, Sri Lanka, and South America. The cases have been reported from throughout India. The endemic foci of infection have been reported from Kerala, cultured in cell-free artificial media. Animal inoculation is also not successful. The mode of infection of this fungus is not known. However, it is suggested that it is transmitted in dust and water. Fish is believed to be the nat-ural host of this fungus. Infection is seen most commonly in persons taking bath in stagnant pools and in individuals who dive in streams to collect sand from river beds. The disease is characterized by the development of large friable polyps or wart-like lesion in the nose, conjunctiva, or eye. The lesion is also occasionally seen in ears, larynx, bron-chus, urethra, vagina, rectum, and skin. Key Points Laboratory diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis depends on demon-stration of sporangia of R. seeberi in tissue sections. R. seeberi can be demonstrated in tissue sections stained with H&E or other special stains, such as GMS stain and PAS stain. The stained smear on microscopic examination shows a hyperplas-tic surface epithelium with the presence of chronic inflam-matory exudates. The epidermis and stroma are 72-5). The sporangia measure 10-200 /H9262m in diameter and contain hundreds of endospores, each measuring 6-7 /H9262m in diameter. The spores when released develop into new sporangia. Treatment of the condition is carried out by surgery or cauterization. Chemotherapy with dapsone is also useful. FIG. 72-5. Introduction Systemic mycoses are caused by fungi of soil, which are inher-ently virulent and cause disease in healthy humans. The systemic include coccidioidomycosis, immitis was first recognized as a distinct disease entity in 1892. C. immitis is a dimorphic fungus, which occurs as a mold in soil and in cul-ture at 25\u00b0C and as a spherule in tissue and in culture at 37\u00b0C. The spherule is oval with a thick, double refractile wall that is filled with endospores. Each endospore, measuring 2-5 /H9262m in diameter gives rise to a new spherule. C. immitis grows in mycelial form in the soil of endemic areas. Subsequently, the hyphal cells either develop into barrel-shaped structures or shrink and die, producing the character-istic arthroconidia. The arthroconidia are the infective stage of the fungus. When the soil is disrupted, the arthroconidia become air-borne and if inhaled by a susceptible host, initiate the infection. The arthrospore inside the pulmonary acinus gives off its outer layer, swells, and develops to a spherical structure called the spherule. The spherule is the parasitic stage of the organ-ism, which reproduces by a process known as endosporulation. Rupture of the spherule leads to release of endospores, each of which matures into spherules and the cycle is repeated. If the organism is cultured, it re-enters the mycelial phase with hyphae formation. The spherule is the characteristic tissue form of the organ- ism. Resistance of the spherule to eradication by host defenses is the main factor in the pathogenesis of disease. Spherules cause progressive suppuration and tissue necrosis. More than half of the cases are asymptomatic. In symptom- atic cases, C. immitis causes a primary pulmonary disease and disseminated disease. Pulmonary infection is the most fre- quent presentation in symptomatic patients. In disseminated disease, virtually every tissue of the body including central nervous system (CNS), skin, and bones is involved. The condi-tion is uncommon, but is highly fatal. C. immitis has a distribution restricted primarily to areas of the Western hemisphere. The southern-central part of California (San Joaquin Valley), Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas, and northern Mexico are the areas of highest endemicity. Laboratory diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is made by demonstration of spherules containing endospores in (a) spu-tum, or smears from the lesion stained by calcofluor white and (b) in biopsy material stained by hematoxylin and eosin, silver, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Culture is the most definitive method for diagnosis. The fungus grows well on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) and other media producing white and cottony colony within 5 days. Identification of colonial mor-phology is not adequate, because other fungi show similar mycelial forms. Therefore, demonstration of typical arthro-conidia is useful to identify the organism. However, arthroco-nidia are infectious, hence pose a significant risk to laboratory personnel. Serodiagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is based on the dem- to antigens in patient's serum. Tube-precipitating antigen and the complement- fixation antigen are the two major antigens used to detect antibodies. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is the most frequently used test to detect serum tube-precipitating antibodies that are IgM antibodies to mycelial phase antigens. These IgM antibod-ies appear in more than 85% of patients with primary infection and are found within the first week after the onset of symptoms. In most patients, these antibodies disappear within 6 months. IgG antibodies detected by complement fixation appear later, with results becoming positive in 85-90% of patients. Key Points Skin test using coccidioidal antigens is used for diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis. It is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that appears 2-21 days after the onset of symptoms and precedes the appearance of serologic markers. Skin test has epidemiologic and prognostic implications. Absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity indicates poor prognosis. However, the skin test has limited diagnostic utility because of its low sensitivity and specificity in endemic areas. Infected individuals may show negative results due to absence of an immune response and healthy individuals may show positive results because of previous infection. DNA probe is a recent method used for accurate identifica- tion of the fungus. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of the condition. Fluconazole can be used for the treatment of mild Systemic Chap-73.indd 603 5/14/2012 1:16:16 PMSection V Chapter 73604 MYCOLOGY moderate disease and, occasionally, for the treatment of life-threatening disease in patients in whom amphotericin B is contraindicated for use. It is used as the drug of choice for long-term therapy of meningeal infection. Paracoccidioidomycosis Paracoccidioidomycosis, also known as South American blastomycosis and Lutz-Splendore-Almeida disease, is a chronic progressive systemic mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a thermally dimorphic fungus found in the soil. It occurs as a mold in the soil and as a yeast in tis-sue. These yeasts are unique in that one large mother cell pro-duces multiple blastoconidia (daughter cells) that arise from multiple sites, resembling a \"Mickey Mouse head\" or a \"pilot wheel.\" This characteristic appearance helps to differentiate this yeast from Blastomyces dermatitidis and all other yeasts. Infection occurs by inhalation of conidia or mycelial frag- ments. The lungs are the primary site of infection. From this site, the fungus then disseminates to other organs through the venous and lymphatic systems. Cell-mediated immu-nity (CMI) is the most important defense mechanism in an immunocompetent host. However, most initial infections are subclinical. In adults, the course of disease is long-term and the outcome is better with appropriate therapy. Pulmonary infection is the most common manifestation. The disease in younger patients is subacute and carries a worse prognosis. Paracoccidioidomycosis has a restricted geographical distri- bution. It is found in South and Central America. The highest incidence is in the southeast province of Brazil, followed by Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Argentina. P. brasiliensis causes natural infection only in armadillos. Bats and saguis may serve as reservoirs. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of conidia or mycelial fragments that are found in the soil. Direct inoculation of the skin or oral mucous membranes is uncommon. However, it may occur from the use of twigs to clean teeth, which is commonly practiced in rural Brazil. The infection can also be transmitted orally by ingestion. Person-to-person transmission does not occur. Laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstration of large, multiple budding yeasts (blastoconidia) in 30% KOH wet mount preparation of sputum. Gomori's methenamine silver of biopsy specimens shows yeast cells mea-suring 2-30 /H9262 m in diameter. Tissue reactions are diffuse in the juvenile form, while granuloma formation is typical in the adult form. The organism is isolated by culture on SDA at 37\u00b0C after 20-30 days.Itraconazole is the drug of choice for treatment of para- coccidioidomycosis and is effective in 95% of patients. Imidazole is also an effective agent with a cure rate of 85-90%. Amphotericin B is used as a reserve for treatment of severe cases that are refractory to treatment with these drugs. Histoplasmosis Histoplasmosis is primarily a disease of reticuloendothelial sys-tem an intracellular fungus Histoplasma capsulatum . H. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, which occurs in two stages: as a mold in soil and as yeast at body temperature in mammals. On SDA medium at 37\u00b0C, this fungus produces cottony mycelial growth. The colony is characterized by thin, branching, septate hyphae that produce tuberculate macroco-nidia 8-20 /H9262m in diameter and have fin-ger-like projections. These are diagnostic form of the fungus. The microconidia are smaller and thin-walled spores, and are the infectious form of the fungus. The parasitic or tissue phase of the fungus is a yeast that measures 2-4 /H9262m in diameter. It is exclusively found within macrophages in the infected host. H. capsulatum infection is acquired by inhalation of conidia and mycelial fragments from contaminated soil. Once inhaled, it is deposited in alveoli of the lung and transformation from the mycelial to the pathogenic yeast form occurs intracellularly inside the macrophages. The yeast inside the macrophages mul-tiplies in approximately 15-18 hours. Multiplication continues within the phagosomes despite fusion with lysosomes. This is possibly due to production of certain proteins by yeasts that inhibit the activity of lysosomal proteases. CMI is key component of host defense against the fungus. T lymphocytes are crucial in limiting the extent of infection. In persons with impaired CMI, Histoplasma species which remained latent in healed granulomas may be reactivated, resulting in histoplasmosis. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic. Nevertheless, H. capsulatum causes acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis, and progressive disseminated his-toplasmosis. Majority of patients with acute pulmonary histo-plasmosis are asymptomatic. Incubation period varies from 3 to 14 days. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms. Cough, hemoptysis, dys-pnea, and/or chest pain may be present. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis is seen in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Cough, weight loss, fevers, and malaise are symptoms. Key Points Serodiagnosis depends on demonstration of P. brasiliensis anti-bodies or antigens in the serum. Enzyme-linked immunosor-bent assay (ELISA) is used to detect antibodies to gp43, the main antigenic determinate of P. brasiliensis with a reported sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%. The test shows cross-reactivity with sera from patients of histoplasmosis or Lobo disease. Western blot detects circulating antibodies to gp43 in the serum in 100% of patients and to gp70, another antigen of the fungus, in 96% of patients. Newer tests that detect Ag7, i.e., antigen found after 7 days of growth, have a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 99%. This antigen detec-tion test is used to monitor patient response to therapy and to detect recurrences. However, skin tests are rarely helpful. Chap-73.indd 604 5/14/2012 PMSection V Chapter 73SYSTEMIC MYCOSES 605 disseminated histoplasmosis is seen in patients who are immunocompromised, such as patients with AIDS. H. capsulatum is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America. It is endemic in the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys of the United States. In endemic areas, the soil provides an acidic, damp environment with high organic content, which favors the growth of fungal mycelia. Bats play an important role in trans-mission of the disease. They can become infected, and they transmit the fungus through their droppings. The soil contam-inated with birds' excretions and droppings of bats remains highly infectious for years. Moreover, human infection occurs following inhalation of spores from contaminated soil. Laboratory diagnosis depends on demonstration of oval yeast cells within macrophages in bone marrow aspirates and in tissue biopsy specimens. Biopsy of oropharyngeal ulcers is usually diagnostic (refer the box Biopsy). Culture of sputum and blood on SDA at 25\u00b0C shows hyphae with tuberculoid macroconidia and at 37\u00b0C shows yeasts. Sputum culture is pos-itive in approximately 10-15% patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis and in 60% of patients with chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis. Complement-fixation test (CFT) and immuno-diffusion (ID) are useful serological tests for demonstration of specific antibodies in serum. The CFT titer greater than 1:8 is considered positive. A titer of 1:32 or more suggests active his-toplasmosis. Cross-reactivity with antigens from B. dermatitidis and C. immitis is a noted problem that may give rise to a false- positive reaction. The ID test detects antibodies to two gly-coproteins, H and M, of H. capsulatum. Anti-H antibody is more specific for active histoplasmosis, is positive in 50-80% of patients, and remains elevated for years. Key Points Detection of specific H. capsulatum antigen in serum and urine is useful in immunocompromised hosts when antibody produc-tion may be impaired. They are usually positive in case of acute progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. Histoplasmin skin test detects a delayed-type hypersensitivity to histoplasmal antigens that occurs 3-6 weeks after exposure. A positive skin test indicates a past or present infection, but does not differentiate between active and past infections. It is positive in approximately 85-90% immunocompetent individuals. DNA probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are also used for diagnosis of the condition. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of disseminated disease. Fluconazole is often recommended for meningitis due to its better penetration of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Asymptomatic or mild condition needs no treatment. Tissue biopsy smear stained by hematoxylin and eosin may show the presence of yeast forms in tissue. Yeast may be detected in areas of case-ation necrosis and calcified lymph nodes by using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain. Yeast forms are rarely seen in stained periph-eral blood smear. BiopsyBlastomycosis Blastomycosis is a granulomatous fungal by B. dermatitidis. B. dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus, which occurs in two stages: as mold in soil and as yeast in tissue. On culture at 37\u00b0C and in tissue, the yeast is a round struc-ture with a double refractile wall and a single broad-based bud. This appearance helps to differentiate it from the Cryptococcus neoformans yeast, which has a narrow-based bud. On culture at 25\u00b0C, the fungus produces a mycelial growth showing typical pyriform microconidia, which measure 2-4 /H9262 m in diameter. B. dermatitidis infection occurs by inhalation of microconidia found in soil, its natural habitat. Inside the lungs, the conidia are transformed to the yeast phase at body temperature. The thick cell wall of the yeasts offers resistance to phagocytosis and induces expression of blastomyces adhesin 1 (BAD1), an immune-modulating virulence factor on the cell surface. Then, the yeasts replicate and may disseminate through the blood and lymphatics to other organs to cause the disease. Pulmonary infection is the major clinical manifestation. A flu-like illness with fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and a nonproductive cough may occur, which resolves within days. In some cases, it may develop to a progressive pulmo-nary disease or may result in extrapulmonary dissemination. Extrapulmonary dissemination to other organs, more often, occurs in patients with chronic pulmonary illness and in those who are immunocompromised. The skin is the most common site of extrapulmonary blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is documented from the United States and also from Canada and the African continent. In endemic areas, blastomycosis is a common infection among dogs. It is also reported in horse, cow, cat, bat, and lion. Microconidia are the infective stages that are present in the soil. Infection is transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosolized conidia. Key Points Sputum microscopy is a very useful test for demonstration of characteristic broad-based budding yeasts of B. derma-titidis. KOH wet mount of pus aspirated from skin micro-abscesses, fistulae, or subcutaneous abscesses is useful to demonstrate the yeast. Sputum culture on SDA medium confirms diagnosis of the condition. However, it may take as early as 5 days or as late as 30 days for colony formation. ELISA is a useful test to detect antibodies against A antigen of B. dermatitidis in the patient's serum. A titer of greater than 1:32 is suggestive of the condition. Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and Western blot techniques are the newer tests that use more specific cell wall antigens of B. dermatitidis for detection of antibodies in the serum. Skin test is not reliable for diagnosis. Amphotericin B and itraconazole are the drugs of choice for treatment of blastomycosis. also called European blastomycosis, is an acute to chronic disease caused by an encapsulated yeast, C. neofor- mans. Cryptococcosis is the most common life-threatening fungal disease in patients with AIDS. It is the only systemic mycosis frequently documented from India. Of the 19 species that comprise the genus Cryptococcus , human disease is associated with only C. neoformans. C. neofor-mans was first described by Busse, a pathologist, in 1984. Kwon-Chung (1976) have described the perfect (i.e., sexual, teleomorphic) form of C. neoformans, which was named Filobasidiella neoformans. Prior to the identification of F. neoformans, which is mycelial, C. neoformans was considered monomorphic yeast. Morphology C. neoformans is a true yeast. It is an oval and budding cyst and measures 3-6 /H9262m in diameter. The yeast may be single or may have a single budding daughter cell. Within the host and in certain culture media, the yeast is surrounded by a wide polysaccharide capsule. The poly-saccharide capsule is composed of mannose, xylose, and glucuronic acid. This fungus forms a narrow-based bud in contrast to that of B. dermatitidis, which forms a broad-based bud. Rarely, pseudohyphae develop. C. neoformans on SDA medium forms smooth, convex, cream-colored colonies at 20-37\u00b0C. Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) wet mount of the colony shows budding yeast cells. C. neoformans has two varieties: C. neoformans var neoformans and C. neoformans var gattii. Based on antigenic specificity of the capsular polysaccharide, the species has been classified into four serotypes. These are serotypes A and D (C. neoformans var neoformans) and serotypes B and C (C. neoformans var gattii). Pathogenesis and Immunity The immune status of the host is the crucial factor in patho-genesis of cryptococcosis. C. neoformans usually causes most serious infections in patients with impaired CMI. These include: patients with AIDS, patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment, patients undergoing organ transplantation, patients with reticuloendothelial malignancy, and patients with sarcoidosis. C. neoformans is primarily transmitted by inhalation (Fig. 73-1). Following inhalation, the yeasts are deposited into the pulmo-nary alveoli, in which they survive before they are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Glucosylceramide synthase has been identified as an essential factor in the survival of C. neoformans in pulmonary alveoli.Cryptococcal polysaccharide capsule has antiphagocytic properties. Hence, unencapsulated yeast are readily phagocy-tosed and destroyed than the encapsulated organisms, which are more resistant to phagocytosis. The antiphagocytic properties of the capsule prevent recognition of the yeast by phagocytes and inhibit leukocyte migration into the area of fungal replication. Host immunity The host immunity in cryptococcal infection is mediated by both cellular and humoral responses. CMI is mediated by natural killer cells and T lymphocytes can inhibit or kill cryp-tococci. An increase in helper T-cell activity, skin test conver-sion, and a reduction in the number of viable organisms in the tissues indicates a successful host response against the fungus. Humoral immunity is mediated by anticryptococcal antibodies and soluble anticryptococcal factors. Both anti-cryptococcal antibodies and the complement play a crucial role in facilitating the macrophage- and lymphocyte-mediated immune response to the organism. Clinical Syndromes C. neoformans causes (a) pulmonary cryptococcosis in immuno-competent hosts and in immunocompromised hosts, (b) and (c) disseminated nonpulmonary non-CNS cryptococcosis. Pulmonary cryptococcosis The clinical manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis are widely variable. Pulmonary disease varies from asymptom-atic colonization of the respiratory tract to acute respiratory distress syndrome affecting immunocompromised hosts. It depends on the immune status of the host.FIG. 73-1. brain and meninges involved in cryptococcal infection of the CNS infections. Meningitis and meningo-encephalitis are the most common manifestations. These are usually subacute or chronic in nature. Without specific therapy, the infection is invariably fatal. The patient dies due to the disease 2 weeks to several years after the symptom onset. Disseminated nonpulmonary non-CNS cryptococcosis Disseminated cryptococcosis includes the skin, prostate, and medullary cavity of the bones, next only to the lungs and CNS, and it occurs most commonly in patients with AIDS and other immunosuppressed conditions. Epidemiology C. neoformans is distributed worldwide. The incidence of cryptococcosis is increasing and now it represents a major life-threatening fungal infection in patients with AIDS. Most cases of cryptococcosis are caused by serotypes A and D. C. neoformans var gattii is the most common variety that causes disease in immu- nocompetent patients. C. neoformans var neoformans is the most common variety that causes disease in immunocompromised patients, e.g., AIDS. C. neoformans is primarily transmitted by inha-lation (Fig. 73-1). Human-to-human transmission does not occur. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of cryptococcal infection is made by demonstration of the yeast in CSF, sputum, pus, and brain biopsy tissue by smear and culture. Methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff stains are used to stain the tissue specimens for demonstra-tion of the capsule of C. neoformans. Fixed tissue may also be stained with mucicarmine, which preferentially stains C. neoformans. India ink preparation is commonly used to detect budding yeast cells in the CSF (Fig. 73-2). The capsule appears as a clear halo around the yeast cells. By this method, cryptococci can be demonstrated in 25-50% of patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Gram-stained smear of the CSF shows Gram-positive yeast cells (Color Photo 63). The culture of centrifuged CSF specimens confirms diagnosis of the condition. This fungus is identified based on its microscopic appearance, biochemical test results, and ability to grow at 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Key Points Pathogenic C. neoformans shows the following It grows at 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), assimilates inositol, does not produce on cornmeal agar. It also produces melanin when incubated on agar that contains seeds from the common weed Guizotia abyssinica. It does not assimilate lactose and nitrates or produce pseudomycelia on cornmeal or rice-Tween agar. Latex agglutination test (LAT) is a frequently used serological test to detect cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in the serum or CSF for diagnosis of meningitis. LAT is an extremely impor-tant adjunct to the diagnosis. Treatment Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for initial therapy in men-ingitis or other disseminated infections caused by C. neoformans. Amphotericin B may be used alone or in combination with flucytosine. The therapeutic goal for patients with cryptococcal disease not complicated by HIV infection is to achieve a per-manent cure of the fungal infection. The therapeutic goal for patients with concomitant HIV infection without a CD4 count of greater than 100 cells//H9262L is to control the acute infection, followed by lifelong suppression of C. neoformans.

Since these fungi become pathogens in individuals with impaired immunity by taking advantage of the host's debilitated conditions, they are called opportunistic fungi. In recent times, there is an increasing list of exotic and rare fungi, which have been associated to cause opportunistic infections. But most opportunistic infections are caused by Candida albicans, are the most common fungal pathogens that affect humans. These species are true opportunistic patho-gens that take advantage of the host's debilitated condition and gain access to the circulation and deep tissues. The genus Candida includes more than 100 species, of which only few cause disease in humans. C . albicans and occasionally other species cause candidiasis, a major infection in immunocom-promised hosts.Candida albicans C. albicans is the most common Candida species, which causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts. It forms the part of the normal flora of the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tract. Properties C. albicans is ovoid or spherical yeast with a single bud. It forms the part of the normal flora of the mucous mem-brane of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respira-tory tract. It produces pseudohyphae in the cultures and in tissues. Pseudohyphae are elongated yeast that may resemble hyphae morphologically, but are really not true hyphae. Candida grows readily on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and on bacteriological culture media. C. albicans produces creamy white, smooth colonies with a yeasty odor (Color Photo 64). It can be differentiated from other Candida species by carbohydrate fermentation reaction and by characteristic growth properties. Only C. albicans produces chlamydospores on cornmeal agar culture at 25\u00b0C. Pathogenesis and Immunity Candida spp. are usually present as part of normal flora on healthy mucosal surface of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. Candida shows colonization at these sites in more than 80% of healthy people. The organism, however, is rarely present on the surface of normal human skin, except occasionally from certain intertriginous area, such as the groin. Pathogenesis of Candida infection Under certain conditions, Candida gains access to systemic circulation from the oropharynx of the gastrointestinal tract. Colonization of the mucocutaneous surface is the first stage in the pathogenesis of Candidal infection. The fungus causes invasion in human tissue through different routes. Disruption of the skin or mucosa allows the organism access to the blood stream. Massive colonization with large numbers of Candida also permits the organism to pass directly into the blood stream, causing the infection. In immunocompromised hosts, Candida may disseminate to many organs, such as lung, spleen, liver, heart, and brain. Candida Opportunistic Fungal Infections Disease Causative V Chapter 74OPPORTUNISTIC FUNGAL INFECTIONS 609 may induce inflammation of the eye, causing endophthalmitis and also may involve skin in 10-30% of patients with dissemi-nated infection. Deficiency in host defence mechanisms plays a significant role in development of Candida infection. Host immunity Both cell-mediated and humoral antibodies confer protection against Candida in healthy adults. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is, however, most important. Alteration in CMI may cause extensive superficial candidiasis, despite having normal or elevated humoral antibodies. The humoral antibodies appear to play minimal role in protection against the disease. Humoral antibodies confer protection against Candida in healthy adults. Clinical Syndromes Candida causes a wide spectrum of clinical illnesses as follows:Cutaneous candidiasis: Candida species in immunocompe- tent host can cause infection of any warm and moist part of the body exposed to environment. It causes infection of the nail, rectum, and other skin folds.Mucocutaneous candidiasis: Mucocutaneous candidiasis (thrush, etc.) is the most common manifesta-tion of candidiasis, but usually does not cause any mortality. In patients with advanced immunodeficiency due to HIV infection, Candida species can cause severe oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis that result in poor intake of food, lead-ing to malnutrition, wasting, and early death. These patients are also usually resistant to treatment with antifungal therapy.Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis: This is a heteroge-neous group of clinical syndromes. This syndrome is charac-terized by chronic, treatment-resistant, superficial Candida infection of the skin, nails, and oropharynx. However, these patients do not show any evidence of disseminated candidiasis.Systemic candidiasis: These include endocarditis, gastro- may be and disseminated candidiasis. In patients with AIDS, oral thrush and Candida esophagitis are more common but not candidemia dis-seminated candidiasis. Candida endophthalmitis and central nervous infection (CNS) infection due to Candida species are other complications of Candida infection.Disseminated candidiasis: This is increasingly becoming a problem in patients with serious hematologic malignan-cies that are treated with immunosuppressive drugs for over a long period of time. Severe neutropenia in these patients is the most important predisposing condition for life-threatening infection caused by Candida. In this condition, Candida usu-ally spreads through the circulation and involves many organs, such as lungs, spleen, kidney, liver, heart, and brain. However, disseminated candidiasis is not a major prob- lem in patients with AIDS. In such patients, serious infection of the oropharynx and the upper gastrointestinal tract is the major problem. The development of these conditions in pre-viously healthy individuals not receiving broad-spectrum anti-biotic therapy should be strongly suspected for possibility of infection with HIV. Epidemiology Candida species is distributed worldwide. In recent times, Candida species have replaced Cryptococcus species as the most common fungi affecting the CNS of immunocompromised patients worldwide. C. albicans and Candida glabrata are responsible for causing infection in 70-80% of patients with invasive candidiasis. Candida tropicalis is an important cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and in those who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. Candida parapsilosis is an important pathogen associated with the use of vascular catheters. Since Candida is present as a part of normal flora already in the skin and mucous membrane of the host, it causes infection in the infected host; it is therefore not transmitted. Laboratory Diagnosis Specimens These include exudates or tissues for microscopy obtained from skin or nails examined by microscope for demonstration of pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells of Candida. Microscopy Gram-stained smear of the exudates or tissue shows Gram-positive, oval, budding yeast and pseudohyphae (Fig. 74-1, Color Photo 65). Since Candida is found as a part of normal flora on normal skin or mucosa, only the presence of large numbers of Candida is of significance. Demonstration of pseu- dohyphae indicates infection, and tissue invasion is of more diagnostic value. Culture Culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) produces typical creamy white, smooth colonies. Different Candida species are FIG. 74-1. Gram-stained smear showing PMSection V Chapter 74610 identified by their growth characteristics, sugar fermentation, and assimilation tests. Germ tube is a rapid method for identi-fication of C. albicans and Candida dubliniensis. This test depends on the ability of C. albicans to produce germ tube within 2 hours when incubated in human serum at 37\u00b0C. This phenomenon is called Reynold-Braude phenomenon (Fig. 74-2, Color Photo 66). Chlamydospores are typically produced by C. albicans on corn- meal agar at 25\u00b0C, but not by other Candida species. Moreover, CHROM agar allows for the presumptive identification of several Candida species by using color reaction in specialized media, thereby showing different colors of the colonies depend-ing on the Candida species. Different Candida species can also be identified with more accuracy by biochemical assays, such as AP120C and AP131C. These assays evaluate the assimilation of various sugars for identification of different fungal species. Nonculture Candida detection tests as Aspergillus , Fusarium, Acremonium, and Saccharomyces species. This test depends on the principle that beta- D-glu- can is a component of the cell wall of these fungi, which can be detected by its ability to activate factor G of the horse-shoe crab coagulation cascade. This test is a highly specific and sensitive test. Immunological tests Serological tests are not that useful in diagnosis of patients with candidiasis because antibodies against Candida appear in sera of patients as well as in that of normal persons. Skin test with Candida antigen is a delayed hypersensitivity skin test, which is used as an indicator of functions of the CMI. The skin test is uniformly positive in immunocompetent adults and indicates that the person has intact CMI. The skin test is negative in indi-viduals who have deficient CMI. Such a person is anergic and is negative to other skin tests, such as purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis.Molecular Diagnosis DNA probe and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are still under evaluation, but appear to be promising. Treatment Antifungal therapy forms the mainstay of treatment of the infections caused by Candida. These agents include azoles amphoteri-cin B. is becoming increasingly important worldwide and is intrinsically less susceptible to amphotericin B and other azoles (ketoconazole, fluconazole, etc). Candida krusei is increasingly recognized because of its resistance to many anti-fungal agents. It is intrinsically resistant to ketoconazole and fluconazole. It is also less susceptible to all other antifungal agents including itraconazole and amphotericin B. C. lusitaniae is also of clinical significance because it is resistant to ampho-tericin B, but it is susceptible to azoles and echinocandins. Prevention and Control Antifungal prophylaxis is indicated for patients with invasive candidiasis who are at high risk of developing invasive candi-diasis. There is no vaccine available against candidiasis. Aspergillosis A broad spectrum of diseases in humans ranging from direct invasion to hypersensitive reactions are caused by Aspergillus species. Although more than 100 species have been described, the majority of human diseases are caused by Aspergillus fumiga- tus and Aspergillus niger, and less frequently flavus and Aspergillus clavatus. Aspergillus Species Properties Aspergillus They septate hyphae that form V-shaped dichotomous branches (Fig. 74-3). The Aspergillus species are identified by (a) their morphological features, (b) the pattern of conidio-phore development, and (c) the color of the conidia. The presence of septate hyphae that branch at 45\u00b0 angles is the typical feature of Aspergillus species hyphae. The hyphae in tissues are best demonstrated with silver stains. The walls of the hyphae are more or less parallel, unlike those of Mucor and Rhizopus, which are more or less irregular. Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) preparation of the colo-nies shows septate hyphae and branching conidiophores. Asexual conidia arranged in chains are present on elongated cells known as sterigmata. The latter is present on the vesi-cle of the conidiophores. The conidia of Aspergillus typically FIG. 74-2. Candida albicans showing formation tube 5/14/2012 1:15:20 PMSection V Chapter 74OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS form radiating chains in contrast to Rhizopus and Mucor, which are found within sporangia. The fungus grows rapidly on SDA and other culture media at 25\u00b0C. Aspergillus produces colonies within 1-2 days and shows a velvety surface. Pathogenesis and Immunity Aspergillus species rarely cause infections in immunocompe- tent individuals. They cause invasive infections mostly in the patients who are immunocompromised either due to (a) use of immunosuppressive drugs, (b) underlying lung diseases, or (c) immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV. In immunocom-promised host, Aspergillus species cause invasion of the blood, thereby causing infarction, hemorrhage, and necrosis of lung tissues. Aspergillus spp. also produces toxic metabolites that inhibit macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis, facilitating dissemination of the infection. Aspergillus species unlike Candida species do not form the part of normal flora of humans. They are ubiquitous in the environ-ment; hence transmission of infection is mostly exogenous. Clinical Syndromes In immunocompetent hosts, Aspergillus species may primar-ily affect the lungs, causing four main syndromes including (a) allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, ( b) chronic It is a hypersensi- tivity reaction to A. fumigatus organisms, which have colonized in tracheobronchial tree. This condition occurs often in asso-ciation with asthma and cystic fibrosis.Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis: It is a subacute infection seen in patients with some degree of immunosuppression. The condition occurs in conjunction with alcoholism, underlying lung disease, or chronic cortico-steroid therapy.Aspergilloma: It is a condition that occurs in a preexist- ing cavity in the lung parenchyma. This cavity may have been caused earlier by tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, and emphysematous bullae. The condition is characterized by the presence of a ball of fungus within the cavity. The fungus, however, does not invade the cavity. It may cause hemoptysis.Invasive aspergillosis: It is a rapidly progressive infection in patients who are severely immunocompromised. The condition is mostly fatal. In immunocompromised host, Aspergillus organ- isms cause a disseminated disease, leading to endophthalmitis, endocarditis, and abscesses in the viscera, such as liver, spleen, kidney, soft tissues, and bone. Epidemiology Various clinical manifestations of Aspergillus infection have been documented worldwide. The incidence of allergic bron-chopulmonary aspergillosis has been increasingly documented in people with asthma in United Kingdom. Aspergillus species unlike Candida species do not form the part of normal flora of humans. They are ubiquitous in the environment; hence trans-mission of infection is mostly exogenous. Laboratory Diagnosis Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis or chronic nec-rotizing aspergillus pneumonia depends on demonstration of Aspergillus in tissue by direct microscopy and culture. Key Points Direct KOH preparation of the specimen shows nonpig-mented, septate hyphae with characteristic dichotomous branching at an angle of 45\u00b0. Biopsy specimens show septate, branching hyphae invading the tissues. The specimens are inoculated on SDA without cyclohexi-mide and are incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1-2 days. Different Aspergillus species produce colonies of various colors. A. fumigatus produces grey colonies, whereas A. niger (Color Photo 67) and A. flavus (Color Photo 68) produce black and yellowish-green colonies, respectively. The isolation of Aspergillus by culture needs to be interpreted with care because they are common laboratory contaminants. Repeated isolation of the fungi may be of helpful to sug-gest the pathogenic role of the Aspergillus. Estimation of serum galactomannan is useful for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Demonstration of elevated galac-tomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage is also useful for diag-nosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is established by a positive skin test for A. fumigatus. Highly increased level of serum IgE (/H110221000 IU/cc) and a positive serology for Aspergillus precipitation or Aspergillus-specific IgG or IgE antibodies are suggestive of the condition. Serum IgG levels are Treatment is most frequently used for treatment of inva-sive aspergillosis. However, the outcome of treatment is not sat-isfactory. Caspofungin is an alternative drug given to patients who do not respond to amphotericin B. Aspergilloma is treated best by removal of the fungus ball from the cavity by surgery. Prevention and Control There are no specific preventive measures available against aspergillosis. Zygomycosis Zygomycosis, also known as mucormycosis or phycomycosis, is an infection caused by saprophytic molds, such as Mucor (Fig. 74-4), Rhizopus (Fig. 74-5), and Absidia. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment and generally saprophytic. They rarely cause disease in immunocompetent hosts, but they are the third most frequent cause of invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. Rhizopus species are the most common causative agents of zygomycosis in humans. Of many Rhizopus species, Rhizopus arrhizus is the most common agent of zygomycosis. The fungal agents of zygomycosis have a high degree of predilection to invade major blood vessels, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and infarction of adjacent tissues. They are also known to affect patients with acidosis secondary to renal insufficiency, diarrhea, and aspirin intake. Most of the infections produced by Zygomycetes are acute and are usually fatal despite early diagnosis and treatment. The agents of zygomycosis are transmitted by air, through their asexual spores. In humans, they invade tissues of patients with reduced host defense. From there, they enter the blood vessels and proliferate in the walls of blood vessels particularly paranasal sinuses, lungs, or intestines. This results in infarction and necrosis of tissues distal to blocked vessels. Zygomycetes cause a spectrum of diseases in humans depending on the immune status of the host and the portal of entry. These cause rhinocerebral zygomycosis, pulmonary zygomycosis, and gastrointestinal zygomycosis. Rhinocerebral zygomycosis is the most common manifestation of disease seen in patients with diabetic acidosis. Fever, unilateral facial pain or headache, nasal congestion, epistaxis, visual disturbance, and lethargy are the common manifestations. Clinical diagnosis of the zygomycosis is frequently difficult. It requires a high degree of suspicion and a host with appropri-ate risk factors. Laboratory diagnosis is by microscopy, culture, and histopathology: Key Points It depends on demonstration of characteristic appearance of broad, nonseptate hyphae with right-angled branches in the specimen by microscopy. KOH mount of discharge scrapings may show broad, irregularly set hyphae with right-angled branches in case of rhinocerebral zygomycosis. Culture on SDA medium without antibiotics is dense and hairy. The LPCB preparation of the colony shows coeno-cytic nature of the hyphae and characteristic sporangia that contain sporangiophores. Fungal cultures are frequently negative. The fungi are difficult to culture because they are a single and very long cells and damage to any part of the cell prevents them to grow. Since culture often fails to show growth, histopathology of affected tissue is very useful to confirm the diagnosis. Fungal stain of biopsy material obtained from the affected tissue showing nonseptate hyphae with broad, irregular branches that form more or less at right angles confirms the diagnosis. Blood cultures are of no value. No serological tests are available. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for mucormycosis. Surgical removal of necrotic, infected tissues is frequently useful. Pneumocystosis Pneumocystis jiroveci, previously known as Pneumocystis of P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). PCP is the opportunistic Pneumocystis is a unicellular fungus found in the respiratory tracts of many mammals and humans. The genus Pneumocystis was initially mistaken for trypanosome, then later as a proto-zoan. Biochemical analysis of the nucleic acid composition of Pneumocystis rRNA and mitochondrial DNA in 1980s estab-lished it as a fungus. The cyst wall closely resembles that of fungi. However, it does not have ergosterol in its membrane as do the fungi, but instead has cholesterol. Properties The organism has three distinct morphologic stages: The trophozoite or tropic form, where it often exists in clusters, The sporozoite, which is a precystic form, and The cyst , which contains several intracystic bodies known as spores. Pathogenesis and Immunity Transmission of infection occurs by inhalation. Once inhaled, the tropic form of the organism attaches to the alveoli. Defects in both cellular immunity and humoral immunity allow for uncontrolled replication of the organism and development of the disease. Activated alveolar macrophages without CD4/H11001 cells fail to eradicate the organism. Clinical Syndromes P. jiroveci causes PCP in HIV patients with their CD4/H11001 cells count below 200//H9262L. It also causes PCP in other patients with primary immune deficiencies including hypogammaglobu-linemia and severe combined immunodeficiency, in organ (e.g., heart, lung, liver kidney)-transplant recipients' long-term immunosuppressive regimens, and in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. Most cases of PCP are asymptomatic. In symptomatic cases, sudden onset of fever, nonproduc- tive cough, dyspnea, and tachypnea are typical manifesta-tions. Bilateral rales and ronchi are present. Extrapulmonary manifestations are rare. It occurs in AIDS patients during their advanced stage. Epidemiology Pneumocystis first came to attention when it was found to cause interstitial pneumonia in Central and Eastern Europe during World War II in severely malnourished and premature infants. Prior to 1981, there were only few reports (less than 100) from the United States. However, in 1981, CDC in the United States reported the occurrence of PCP in five healthy homosexual males residing in the Los Angeles. Now P. jiroveci is recognized as one of the common causes of life-threatening opportunistic infections in patients with HIV infection worldwide. Lungs of healthy individuals are the habitat of the fungus. Most children are believed to have been exposed to the organ-ism by age 3 or 4 years. PCP causes a mortality of 10-20% in patients with HIV depending on the stage of the disease. It also causes a consid-erable degree of mortality and morbidity in non-HIV patients. In developing countries many of the cases are not being reported due to nonavailability of modern healthcare. Pneumocystis is found to be responsible for up to 80% of HIV-infected infants with pneumonia in Africa. Laboratory Diagnosis Chest radiographs in most patients show diffuse bilateral infil-trates extending from the perihilar region. Patchy asymmetric infiltrates and pneumatoceles are less common finding. Key Sputum induced by inhalation of a hypertonic saline solu-tion is a useful specimen for microscopic demonstration of the organism. Pneumocystis is less frequently demonstrated in expectorated sputum. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the most common invasive procedure used to diagnose PCP. This is recommended when PCP is strongly suspected but induced sputum sample is repeatedly negative. It has a high sensitivity of more than 90%. Wright, Cresyl violet, and Giemsa stain detect both the tro-phozoite and cyst forms, but not the cyst wall. Methenamine silver, Gram-Weigert, and toluidine blue selectively wall of Pneumocystis Pneumocystis. Direct immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies is a more sensitive method than histologic techniques for detection of Pneumocystis in histopathologic specimens. Open lung biopsy has 100% sensitivity and specificity because it provides the greatest amount of tissue for diag-nosis. This is but an invasive procedure, hence reserved for rare cases when bronchoscopy is nondiagnostic. Treatment P. jiroveci, although considered a fungus, does not respond to treatment with antifungal agents. A combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice for treatment of PCP. Pentamidine and atovaquone are alternative drugs. Prevention and Control Chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole or aerosolized pentamidine is useful for prevention of infection in patients with CD4 counts below 200//H9262L. species rarely cause opportunistic infections in humans. The Penicillium species are identified by their typical morphology (Fig. 74-6), culture characteristics on the SDA medium (Color Photo 69), and microscopy (Color Photo 70). P. marneffei is the only dimorphic fungus in the genus Penicillium known to cause opportunistic infection. Penicillium marneffei P. marneffei is the only dimorphic fungus in the genus Penicillium. It has been reported as an important opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients. The fungus causes tuberculosis-like disease in patients with AIDS in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand. Few case reports have also been documented from India. Capponi and colleagues (1956) first demonstrated P. marneffei in liver of a bamboo rat. A laboratory-acquired case due to accidental inoculation of the skin was documented by Gabriel Segretian. Gabriel Segretian named the organism in honor of Hubert Marneffei. First case of natural human infection was reported by DiSalvo and colleagues (1973) in an American minister with Hodgkin's disease. Key Points The fungus, which is a dimorphic fungus, grows rapidly on SDA. At 25\u00b0C, it grows as a mold and produces greenish yellow colonies with dark green edge and pink or red center. It exhi-bits brick red pigment on the reverse. At 37\u00b0C, it grows as small yeast, producing cream-colored mucoid colonies resem-bling Histoplasma capsulatum . Ability of the yeast forms to proliferate inside macrophages is the virulence characteristic of the fungus. The conidia attach to laminin, a glycoprotein in basement membrane, via sialic acid pathway and initiate the infection.Incubation period is variable from few weeks to years. P. marneffei causes asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent hosts. It causes granulomatous or suppurative reaction, broncho-pneumonia with or without adenopathy, and cavitary lung lesion. It produces chronic cervical lymphadenitis resembling tuberculosis. Disseminated infections occur rarely in immuno-competent hosts. P. marneffei causes disseminated infection in immuno- compromised hosts, such as patients with HIV. It develops a necrotizing reaction and involves the skin, lung, and intestine. It causes disseminated infections of reticuloendothelial system, and also allergic diseases and mycotoxicoses. The disseminated infection is more common in adults than in children. P. marneffei is widely distributed in the nature. Its natural habitat is soil. The fungus infects no mammals other than humans and bamboo rat. Fungus is found in feces of rats and also in burrows made by the rats in the soil. The infection is transmitted by inhalation of conidia, direct inoculation of the skin, and rarely, by ingestion of infected rats. The condition is more common in rainy season, in rural areas. Cell-mediated immunodeficiency, steroid treatment, and HIV infection are predisposing factors. The fungus is endemic in Southeast Asian countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, and Indonesia. There has been recent increase in cases due to onset of AIDS pandemic. In India, 4 cases were reported by Singh and col-leagues (1999) from eastern state of Manipur. Laboratory diagnosis of the infection is made by micros- copy, culture and serology: Key Points Demonstration of P. marneffei in the skin and mucosal scrapings, sputum, stool, blood, urine, lymph node, bone marrow, lung and liver biopsy specimens. Staining of skin, lymph node, and bone marrow aspirate by hematoxylin and eosin, PAS (periodic acid-Schiff), Wright's, and cells with transverse septa. Immunohistochemical assay using monoclonal antibody against an external wall epitope is used to identify P. marnef-fei in tissues. Demonstration of fungal antigen in affected tissue by using direct immunofluorescence antibody also helps in diagnosis of the condition. Peripheral blood smear shows P. marneffei in patients with AIDS. Culture is the gold standard. P. marneffei is a highly infectious fungus, hence culture should be done in a laboratory with a biohazard safety level-2 precautions. The fungus on SDA without cycloheximide and at 25\u00b0C produces mycelial grayish white colonies, green center, white periphery, and bright rose pigmented reverse (Color Photo 71). Microscopy of the colony shows septate hyaline hyphae, branched conidiophores, and three to five medullae which produce phialides that bear conidia in chains. The fungus on SDA at 37\u00b0C produces yeast-like colonies and cream-colored mucoid with brown red pigment. Microscopy of the colony shows pleomorphic ellip-soidal to rectangular yeast cells with transverse septum. Indirect antibody test, immunoblot assay, and immunodiffusion method using mycelial phase culture antigen are used to demonstrate serum IgG anti-bodies. Immunodiffusion and latex agglutination tests are used to detect P. marneffei antigen in serum and urine. FIG. 74-6. PMSection V Chapter 74OPPORTUNISTIC FUNGAL INFECTIONS 615 Treatment of the condition is carried out by administration of amphotericin B for 2 weeks followed by oral itraconazole for 10 weeks. Pseudoallescheria boydii Infection Pseudoallescheria boydii is a mold that causes an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised persons, such as patients with HIV. It causes a disease, which clinically resembles aspergillosis. The diagnosis is made by demonstration of sep-tate hyphae in tissue that resemble with those of Aspergillus. It can be differentiated from Aspergillus by culture on SDA medium. On culture, P. boydii produces pear-shaped conidia. The fungus causes cutaneous zygomycosis and disseminated zygomycosis. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are the drugs of choice for treatment of P. boydii infection. Amphotericin B is not useful. Surgical removal of necrotic infected tissue is also useful. Fusarium solani Infection Fusarium solani is a mold that causes disease primarily in neu-tropenic patients. It resembles Aspergillus in that it is a mold with aseptate hyphae, which tends to invade blood vessels. Fever associated with lesions in the skin is the common clinical presentation. The fungus differs from Aspergillus by culture in which it produces banana-shaped conidia. F. solani causes a disseminated disease primarily in neutro- penic patients. Blood culture is frequently useful for diag-nosis of the condition. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. A 32-year-old lady with AIDS was admitted to a hospital with fever and other nonspecific symptoms. Examination of her tongue revealed a white, thick patch. HIV serology was positive. Microscopy of the exudates collected from the patch showed Gram-positive Candida. Her CD4 count was 200//H9262L of blood. How will you confirm the species identification of Candida?

It has been estimated that humans have approximately 10 13 cells in their body and about 1014 bacteria are associated with them. The majority of bacteria are present in the large bowel, which constitutes the normal flora. The organisms are present in those parts of the body that are exposed to, or communicate with, the external environment, namely, the skin, nose, mouth, and intestinal and urogenital tracts. Internal organs and tissues are normally sterile. The human fetus, in pregnant mother, lives in a sterile environment protected from microbes except when pathogens like cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, or Toxoplasma gondii cross the placenta for first 9 months of life. At the time of birth, the newborn is confronted with the mother's vaginal microbes and environmental organisms. The infant's skin surface is initially colonized followed by the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and mucosal surfaces. Microbes that have the ability to cause serious diseases are normally found in and on the human body. Not the recovery of specific organism, but the recovery of the organism in a nor-mally sterile site is the hallmark of pathogenesis of microbial infections. For example, Escherichia coli is a normal resident confined to the gastrointestinal tract. If it is demonstrated in the stool, it may be considered normal, but if found in the abdominal cavity or the patient's blood stream, this would be considered abnormal. Similarly, there are certain organisms that are never present as part of the normal microbial flora in humans; hence their recovery in humans is always associ-ated with clinically significant diseases (e.g., Bacillus anthracis, Brucella spp., Francisella tularensis, and Histoplasma capsulatum, etc.). Viruses and parasites are not considered as members of the normal microbial flora because they are not found as commen-sals in the host. Functions of Resident Flora It should be appreciated that microbes serve a useful purpose in their human hosts. The normal microbiota maintains a pro-tected environment that prevents colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms. For example, Clostridium difficile pro-duces gastrointestinal disease when the normal intestinal flora have been reduced or removed by antibiotics. The production of proteolytic enzymes by microbes augments host factors in the digestion of food. Intestinal bacteria can also synthesize vita-mins and other biological products (e.g., biotin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin, vitamin K, etc.). Colicins produced by some bacteria of normal flora prevent harmful effects of the bacteria. The normal microbial flora is more or less constant for each mammalian species and is broadly divided into residents and transients. The interaction between microbes and humans can result in the following general outcomes: (a ) disease, (b ) transient colonization, and (c) prolonged colonization. Disease results when the interaction between microbe and human host results in a pathological process. This process is mediated by microbial factors or by the host's immune response to the presence of the organism. The other outcome of microbe and host interaction is colonization, either transient or prolonged. Infection is another term used for colonization, which does not imply disease, but rather the association of the microbe with the human hosts for a time. The transient and prolonged colonization imply a distinction based on the duration of the interaction, which may extend to weeks, months, or years. Factors Determining the Colonization byMicrobes Factors that determine whether exposure to a microbe result in transient passage through a human host or prolonged colonization are complex and involve microbial properties, host characteristics, and environmental factors. Key Points Colonization of skin is accomplished by organisms that: can tolerate the dry surface and are resistant to fatty acids produced by anaerobic bacteria and from the metabolism of sebum triglycerides. The most important factors that determine colonization in human body are the properties of the specific organism. For Normal Microbial Flora Chap-75.indd 619 5/14/2012 1:14:40 PMSection VI Chapter 75620 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY example, the oropharynx provides the organisms opportunities to colonize saliva, mucosal surface, tongue, and gingiva and teeth line. Thus oxygen-sensitive bacteria proliferate in the gingival crevices. Streptococcus mutans organisms adhere to the hard surface of teeth by polysaccharide. Bacteria can also bind to cells lining the oropharynx, intestine, and vagina via specific receptors for the bacterial pili. This type of adhesion prevents the mechanical elimination of organisms. Various host factors determine the success of coloniza- tion with microbe. Nutritional and environmental conditions must favor the survival of microbes. The age of the host also influences microbial colonization. The hormonal secretions, alteration of dietary habits, person-to-person interaction, sexual activity, and many other factors determine the establish-ment of normal microbiota. Normal Flora at Various Sites of the Body Respiratory Tract Respiratory tract is subdivided into (a) the upper airways, which include the anterior and posterior nares and the nasopharynx; (b) the middle airways comprising the oropharynx and tonsils; and (c) the lower airways with larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The structural and physiological differences at each site provide an environment compatible for some organisms and hostile for others. Nares and nasopharynx Nares are inhabited by a small number of organisms, which include Staphylococcus , Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium species. The microbial population in the nasopharynx is more complex with the of can readily recovered from the nasopharynx. Twelve species of Neisseria have been recovered from nasopharyngeal carriers. Colonization with Neisseria meningitidis varies from 10% to 95% with the highest incidence in young adults. Other Neisseria species that colonize the Kingella species. Noncapsulated strains of influenzae also commonly found in the nasopharynx. Oropharynx and tonsils The oropharynx is a ratio of 100:1. The most common anaerobic bacteria present in the oropharynx are Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, and Fusobacterium, whereas the most common aerobic bacteria are Streptococcus and Neisseria. Nearly 20% of individuals are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus species that colonize the oropharynx are S . salivarius Streptococcus sanguis Other Gemella species, spp. are present in almost all individuals in less than 5% of the microbial population. Fifty percent of them are noncapsulated. H. parainfluenzae makes 10% of the bacterial flora in saliva. Members of the Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli are also present in the oro-pharynx in small numbers or transiently. Gram-positive bacteria are also predominant microbes that constitute normal flora of the oropharynx. Actinomyces are present in large numbers, comprising 20% of bacterial flora in saliva and on the tongue, 35% in the gingival crev-ices, and 40% in the dental plaque. The ability of Actinomyces spp. to colonize various surfaces is mediated by the fimbriae and other extracellular polysaccharides present in the bac-teria. Propionibacterium, and Rothia The most common Fusobacterium found in the mouth. Fungal colonization of the oropharynx is restricted to yeasts only; Candida albicans is present almost all individuals. alis and Trichomonas tenax the oropharynx. Trachea, larynx, bronchi, and lungs Colonization of the lower airways is transient with few organisms present at any one time. Long-term colonization may occur when the ciliated epithelial cells are damaged or altered in a disease process. Gastrointestinal Tract The gastrointestinal tract can be divided into various distinct anatomical areas. These include esophagus, stomach, jejunum and upper ileum, distal small intestine, and large intestine. The microbial flora present on the mucosa, within crypts, and in the lumen is different. Complete information has been obtained for the stomach and large intestine by studying the microbial composition of feces or the specimens collected during the intra-abdominal surgery. Chap-75.indd 620 FLORA Esophagus Sufficient information is not available about the microbial flora of the esophagus. However, transient colonization by oropharyngeal bacteria and yeasts is known to occur. Stomach Stomach is an inhospitable organ containing hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. For this reason, the normal microbial flora is very sparse. The organisms present in the stomach are acid- tolerant Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori causes gastritis and gastric and duodenal ulcers and is associated with gastric malignancy. Jejunum and upper ileum The number of microbes in the upper part of the small intestine is less than 10 5/mL of fluid. They are predominantly anaero- bic, consisting of Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella. If upper tract obstruction and stasis occur, then the microbial flora shifts to resemble colonic bacteria, thereby leading to malabsorption syndrome. Distal small intestine This is the transition area between the stomach (where a sparse number of acid-tolerant bacteria are found) and the large intes-tine (which is inhabited by a plethora of microbes). The micro-bial population is large (10 8-109 organisms/g of feces) and diverse with the predominance of anaerobes. Large intestine This is the most densely populated organ in the human body. It consists of more than 10 8 aerobic bacteria and 1011 anaerobic bacteria per gram of feces. Various yeasts and nonpathogenic parasites reside in this area. The bacteria in the large intestine that are present in large numbers fragilis is the most virulent species, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is more numerous in the colon. Eubacterium spp. is the second most common bacterium in the large intestine. The most commonly isolated species are Eubacterium aerofaciens, Eubacterium Bifidobacterium have been isolated in feces. Among Enterococcus species, the most frequently isolated ones are Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium . E. coli causes colonization soon after an infant is born. It is the most common facultative organism responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Other in the intestine. Streptococcus species and Actinomyces have been isolated from fecal specimens. A variety of Peptostreptococcus and Gemella species are members of the normal intestinal flora. The spore-forming Bacillus species and Clostridium species are isolated from fecal specimens. Vibrio parahaemolyticus can also colo-nize the intestinal tract, but only in small numbers. Other organisms commonly isolated in small numbers include species of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella species. Various species of Candida and protozoa colonize the large intestine. Genitourinary Tract With the exception of female urethra and vagina, the genito-urinary tract is generally sterile. The ureters, kidneys, prostrate, and cervix are normally sterile. The female urethra is colonized with large number of lactobacilli, streptococcal species, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Fecal as E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and Candida spp. can also colonize the female urethra, which is transient. The microbial flora in the vagina is more numerous and div erse. Lactobacilli are the predominant organisms with most commonly isolated species being Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus cellobiosus. Other are Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella species. Actinomyces species are believed to be present in the vagina because they are associated with vaginal infections. Actinomyces israeli is the most common Actinomyces species associated with gen- ital actinomycotic infections. Propionibacterium and Mobiluncus spp. are also present in the vagina. The aerobic bacteria present in the vagina include coagulase- negative Staphylococcus, in vaginal specimens. Six species of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma are common inhabitants of vagina, which have pathogenic potential. The flagellate Trichomonas vaginalis is present in small numbers in healthy women. Candida species and Torulopsis glabrata are common members of the microbial flora of vagina. Body Surface Human skin is constantly bombarded by organisms present in the environment. The skin is exposed to extremes of tem-perature, moisture, and to chemical disinfectants. There the microbial population is less numerous and complex than at other body sites. The skin is not a homogenous surface. There are relatively dry areas like palms and soles; areas with more apocrine glands, such as axillary, inguinal, and perianal areas; and areas rich with sebaceous glands like forehead and nasola-bial folds. Most organisms proliferate in the moist area. Thus higher densities of microbes are present in areas rich with sweat glands. The skin of face, perirectal area, or groin has a more complex microbial flora than that at other sites (Fig. 75-1). Anaerobic bacteria are 10- to 100-fold more numerous on the skin surface as compared to aerobic bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria predominate over Gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria more commonly recovered from skin surfaces Propionibacterium spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most commonly isolated bacterium. Other coagulase- negative staphylococci found on the skin include Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus capitis. Micrococcus luteus is the most common spp. present on the skin and repre- sents 20% of the bacterial population on the head, legs, and arms. Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anaero- bic Peptostreptococcus spp. also establish residence on the skin surface. Corynebacterium species present on the skin surface include Propionibacterium spp. and Clostridium perfringens. Gram-negative bacteria are generally not recovered from the surface of skin, except during transient colonization. Acinetobacter spp. organisms have adapted to survive in moist areas of the skin. Fungal colonization of the skin surface is transient. This includes colonization with yeasts (C. albicans, Malassezia furfur, and Rhodotorula) and dermatophytes. Among these, M. furfur is present in most of the individuals. Conjunctiva The flushing action of tears and presence of lysozymes in the tears usually make the conjunctiva free of bacteria. The organ-isms that may be present in the conjunctiva are C. xerosis, Moraxella spp., S. aureus, and nonhemolytic streptococci. Sterile Sites The body fluids which include blood, cerebrospinal fluid, syno-vial, pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, and other exudates are nor-mally sterile or transiently infected by microbes. Some microbes from the mouth and gastrointestinal tract can invade the blood stream in healthy individuals (during tooth brushing or a bowel movement). These organisms are rap-idly removed and are of little significance. Thus, the isolation of an organism from body fluids should be considered significant unless the specimen is contaminated during its collection. Organ tissues are also generally sterile unless they are infected following systemic spread. Some bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis may be disseminated to lungs, liver, and kidney during initial infection and remain dormant. In this situation, the organism can be recovered from tissue samples. Long-term colonization with organisms like Pneumocystis carinii or latent viruses, such as herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus may commonly occur. The external auditory meatus, being an extension of the skin, is colonized primarily by S. epidermidis and diphtheroids. Human body serves as a home for numerous microbes qual- itatively and quantitatively. They cover the skin and mucosal surfaces; occasionally, they invade into sterile sites to produce disease. These microorganisms act as a barrier to more viru-lent microorganisms, provide vitamins and required growth factors, or exist as commensal inhabitants. The complexity of the microbiota is influenced over time by environmental, host, and microbial factors. Thus, the knowledge of the human microbiota forms a fundamental building block of the normal physiological processes in the 622 5/14/2012 1:14:42 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 76 Introduction Drinking water or potable water, ideally, should not only be safe but also pleasant to drink. It should be clear, colorless, and devoid of disagreeable taste or smell. It should be free from pathogenic microorganisms and chemical substances. Similarly, milk is usually sterile at secretion in the udder but is contaminated by bacteria even before it leaves the udder. Except in the case of mastitis, the bacteria at this point are harmless and few in number. Further infection of the milk by microorganisms can take place during milking, handling, stor-age, and other preprocessing activities. Innumerable microorganisms are present all over in air in the environment. Apart from bacteria, molds and viruses are also present and can be transmitted from person to person in the form of aerosols. The proportion of the dust particles or aerosols reaching the lung depends on their size. All particles over 5 /H9262m are retained in the nose and those of 1 /H9262m reach the lung and are retained in the alveoli. Bacterial analysis of water, milk and air is therefore carried out to indicate quality of these items used in day-to-day life. Bacteriology of Water Water is said to be contaminated or polluted when it is contam-inated with sewage or other excreted matter from humans and animals that contains infective and parasitic agents, poisonous chemical substances, and industrial or other wastes. Bacterial Flora in Water Bacterial flora in water (Table 76-1) can be classified into three groups as follows:Natural water bacteria: These are the bacteria that are com- monly found in water free from gross pollution.Bacteriology of Water, Milk, and Air Source of water Bacteria Natural water bacteria Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Serratia, Alcaligenes, and Flavobacterium Soil subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes Sewage bacteria:Proper sewage in waterSoil bacteria: These are the bacteria that are not normal inhabitants of water but are found after being washed into the water during heavy rains.Sewage bacteria: These are the bacteria that are not normal inhabitants of water but are found in water after being contam-inated with sewage. These bacteria include those which are the normal inhabitants of the intestine of humans and animals. These also include the bacteria that live mainly on decomposed organic matter of either plant or animal origin. Factors Determining the Number of Bacteria in Water The following factors determine the number of bacteria in water:Salinity: The number of bacteria present in water depends on salinity of water; more is the salinity, lesser is the number of bacteria. However, some halophilic bacteria survive better in saline water.Acidity: Acidity of water has a deleterious effect on most of the bacteria.Temperature: Low temperature usually favors survival of the bacteria. However, in the presence of organic materials, bacteria tend to multiply even at high temperature.Light: Sunlight with the wavelength of 300-400 nm is highly bactericidal, provided water is clear and static. The bactericidal effect is reduced due to the presence of organic matter and due to movement in water.Storage: Storage of water decreases bacterial count in stored water due to sedimentation and revitalization.Organic matter: When organic matter is plenty, the micro-organisms tend to multiply and are present in large numbers whereas when it is less, the organisms are few.Type of water: Surface water is more likely to be contami-nated than the deep water. The latter is usually pure. Chap-76.indd 623 5/14/2012 1:13:47 PMSection VI Chapter 76624 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY Water-Borne Microorganisms Supply of drinking water is contaminated with sewage or other excreted matter from humans and animals; it can transmit a wide number of pathogens that includes bacteria, viruses, and parasites (Table 76-2). Bacteriological Examination of Water Since a wide number of pathogens can be transmitted by con-taminated water, it is essential to know whether water is free of such pathogens or not. Hence, the main purpose of water testing is to know whether the water is contaminated by water-borne pathogen or not. Therefore, in the interests of public health, water supplies should be tested regularly to confirm their freedom from such contamination. It is impracticable to make an attempt to detect all types of water-borne pathogens, any of which may be present only intermittently. Instead attempt is made on testing the water for microorganisms that indicate fecal contamination of water. These are known as indicator organisms. These are usually common intestinal commensal bacteria, which are universally present in and excreted in large numbers in human and animal feces. They are rarely found in other sources. Indicator organisms The presence of indicator organisms indicates that: fecal matter has entered the water supply, the fecal bacteria have not been killed or removed by purifi-cation processes, and the water supply, therefore, is liable to be contaminated with dangerous intestinal pathogens. Key Points The indicator organism should have the following properties: It should be present in human feces in large numbers; It should not multiply in water to any extent; and It should be more resistant than pathogens to the stresses of the aquatic environment and disinfection processes, such as the process of chlorination. Some of the organisms that are used as indicator organisms are as follows:Coliforms: These are the bacteria that occur in large numbers in sewage and feces. They are also found in the environment in the absence of fecal contamination. Traditionally, these are members of the Enterobacteriaceae, which grow in the presence of bile salts and produce acid and gas from lactose within 48 hours at 37\u00b0C. The total coliform count is widely regarded as the most reliable indicator of potable water quality.Fecal streptococci: These bacteria are found in the intestinal tract of humans and animals. They belong to the genus Enterococcus, and are catalase-negative and Gram-positive cocci. They can survive at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes, and can grow at a pH of 9.6 and in the presence of 6.5% sodium chloride.Sulfite-reducing clostridia: These are members of the genus Clostridium, which can reduce sulfite to sulfide. The most important of the group is Clostridium perfringens. Although it is less numerous in human feces than other indi-cator organisms, its spores can survive in the environment and treatment processes better than most of other indicator bacteria. Collection of water samples for analysis Water samples should be collected in heat-sterilized bottles of 250 mL capacity with ground glass stoppers. A 0.23 mL of fresh 1.8% solution of sodium thiosulfate crystal is added into the bottle before sterilization, to neutralize the bactericidal effect of any chlorine or chloramine in the water.Sampling from a tap or pump outlet: When collecting from taps, allow the water to run to waste for 2-3 minutes before running it into the bottle. Then the stopper of the bottle is opened, it is filled with water, and the stopper is replaced.Sampling from a reservoir, such as stream, river, lakes, and tanks: When sampling from streams or lakes, the bottle is opened at a depth of about 30 cm with its mouth facing the current and it is ensured that the water entering the bottle has not been in contact with hands.Sampling from a well: The sampling bottle is tied with a stone and a clean cord of suitable length and is lowered to the required depth in the well. The bottle is completely immersed in the water. When the bottle is completely filled, it is pulled out and then it is stoppered. It is ensured that the bottle does not touch the side of the well at any time. The bottle, after collection of water, is wrapped by a Kraft paper and is labeled with following details: the source, time, and date of collection of water samples. The bottle is transported immediately pref-erably within 6 hours of collection in a cool container being protected from the sunlight.Bacteria Vibrio cholerae; Salmonella ; Yersinia enterocolitica; and Campylobacter jejuni Viruses Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis E virus, poliomyelitis OF WATER, MILK, AND AIR 625 Methods of water analysis Following tests are generally done for the routine bacteriologi-cal analysis of water: 1. Presumptive coliform count 2. Differential coliform count 3. Membrane filtration method 4. Detection of fecal streptococci and C. perfringens 5. De tection of specific coliform count: The test is called presumptive coliform count because the reaction demonstrated may occa-sionally be due to the presence of some other microorganisms. This is a multiple tube method in which measured volumes of water and dilutions of water are added to a series of tubes or bottles containing a liquid indicator medium. The most com-mon medium used is double-strength and single-strength MacConkey broth containing bromocresol purple and an inverted Durham's tube to detect the production of gas. The measured volume of water to be tested is added by sterile graduated pipettes to tubes or McCartney bottles as follows: (a ) 50 mL of water is added to one bottle of 50 mL double-strength medium, (b ) 10 mL of water each to five bot- tles of 10 mL double-strength medium, (c ) 1 mL of water each to five tubes of 5 mL single-strength medium, and (d ) 0.1 mL of water each to five tubes of 5 mL single-strength medium. The inoculated bottles are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. The presumptive coliform count/100 mL of water is determined by demonstration of acid and gas in MacConkey broth using the McCrady probability Table 76-3. The water sample showing a presumptive coliform count of 0 is considered as excellent, whereas water samples show-ing coliform counts of 1-3, 4-10, and more than 10/mL considered as satisfactory, suspicious, and unsatisfactory, respectively.Differential coliform count: Differential coliform count is carried out by Eijkman test. Some spore-bearing bacteria give false-positive reactions in the presumptive coliform test. The Eijkman test is used to determine whether the coliform bacilli detected in the presumptive test are Escherichia coli or not. The test is carried out after the usual presumptive test and is performed by inoculating subcultures from the posi-tive presumptive tests at 44\u00b0C and into fresh tubes of single-strength MacConkey broth with Durham's tube. Those tubes showing gas in Durham's tube after incubation at 44\u00b0C after 24 hours indicate the presence of E. coli. Confirmation of E. coli is made by subculturing on the solid media and test- ing the color for indole production and citrate utilization (Fig. 76-1).Detection of fecal streptococci: Detection of fecal strepto-cocci in water sample also indicates fecal contamination of water. The test is carried out after the usual presumptive test and is performed by incubating subcultures from the positive pre-sumptive tests at 44\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C into fresh tubes. It is incu-bated at 45\u00b0C for 18 hours.

Further confirma- tion of subculturing on the MacConkey medium.Detection of C. perfringens: It is detected in water samples by inoculating it in litmus milk medium and incubating it anaero-bically at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. A typical stormy clot reaction along with formation of acid indicates the presence of C. perfringens. Further confirmation of the bacteria is made by motility and nitrate reduction test.Membrane filtration method: In this method, a measured volume of the water sample is filtered through a membrane with a pore size small enough to retain the indicator bacteria to be counted. The membrane is then placed and incubated on a selective indicator medium, so that the indicator bacteria grow to produce colonies. These colonies are then identified and counted to give a measure of the contamination of the water.Detection of specific pathogens: Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, etc. are the specific pathogens, which can be detected in water sample to know the contamination. Specific selective media for these bacteria are employed to detect these in con-taminated water. For example, double-strength selenite F broth is used for S. Typhi, whereas alkaline peptone water is used for V. cholerae. Subsequently, these bacteria are identified by their cultural and biochemical characteristics. Bacteriology of Milk Milk is an opaque white liquid, which provides the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to digest other types of food. It is an emulsion of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid. Each fat globule is surrounded by a membrane, consisting of phospholipids and proteins. These emulsifiers keep the individual globules from joining together into noticeable grains of butterfat and also protect the globules from the fat-digesting activity of enzymes found in the fluid portion of the milk. Bacterial Flora of Milk Lactic acid bacteria: This group of bacteria is able to ferment lactose to lactic acid. They are normally present in the milk and are also used as starter cultures in the production of cultured dairy products, such as yogurt. Some examples of lactobacilli found in milk are: 37\u00b0C. Coliforms are indicator organisms; they are closely associated with the presence of pathogens but are not necessarily pathogenic themselves. They also can cause rapid spoilage of milk because they are able to ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas, and are able to degrade milk proteins. They are killed by pasteurization; therefore, their presence after treatment is indicative of contamination. E. coli is an example belonging to this group. Significance of Presence of Microorganisms in Milk Information on the microbial content of milk can be used to judge its sanitary quality and the conditions of production. If permitted to multiply, bacteria in milk can cause spoilage of the product. Milk is potentially susceptible to contamination with pathogenic microorganisms. Precautions must be taken, therefore, to minimize this possibility and to destroy patho-gens that may gain entrance. Certain microorganisms produce chemical changes that are desirable in the production of dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt. Spoilage Microorganisms in Milk The microbial quality of raw milk is crucial for the produc-tion of quality dairy foods. Spoilage is a term used to describe the deterioration of a foods' texture, color, odor, or flavor to the point where it is unappetizing or unsuitable for human consumption. Microbial spoilage of food often involves the degradation of protein, carbohydrates, and fats by the micro-organisms or their enzymes. In milk, the microorganisms that are principally involved in spoilage are psychrotrophic organisms. Most psychrotrophs are destroyed however, like teolytic and lipolytic extracellular enzymes, which are heat sta-ble and capable of causing spoilage. Some species and strains Bacillus, can survive pasteurization and grow at refrigeration temperatures, which can cause spoilage problems. Pathogenic Microorganisms in Milk Hygienic milk production practices, proper handling and storage of milk, and mandatory pasteurization have decreased FIG. 76-1. Eijkman test.

There have been a number of food-borne illnesses resulting from the ingestion of raw milk or dairy products made with milk that was not properly pasteurized or was poorly handled, causing postprocessing contamination. Milk-borne diseases are of three types: Infections primarily of humans but transmitted through milk. Infections primarily of animals that can be transmitted to humans. Infections transmitted by milk contaminated with excreta of ticks and rats (Table 76-4). It should also be noted that molds, mainly of the species of Aspergillus , Fusarium, and Penicillium can grow in milk and dairy products. If the conditions permit, these molds may produce mycotoxins, which can be a health hazard. Bacteriological Examination of Milk Bacteriological examination of milk can be carried out by fol-lowing groups of tests: 1. Colony counts 2. Coliform counts 3. Chemical tests, such as methylene blue reduction test, phosphatase test, and turbidity test 4. De tection of specific pathogens Colony counts This test is carried out by plate dilution methods. Raw milk may contain 500 to several million bacteria/mL of milk. Coliform counts The presence of coliforms in milk indicates improper pasteuri-zation of milk, or postpasteurization contamination of milk. This is because all coliforms are destroyed during the process of pasteurization of milk. This test is carried out by inoculating varying dilutions of milk into MacConkey medium and noting the production of acid and gas after 48 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. The presence of acid and gas indicates the presence of coliforms in milk. Chemical tests Methylene blue test: This is a test used since long to demon- strate bacterial contamination of milk. It is an indicator of the number of viable bacteria present in the milk. It is a rapid and inexpensive way of indicating poor-quality milk that had been unrefrigerated. The basis of the test is that the presence of via-ble bacteria in milk reduces methylene blue and decolorizes the milk when kept in a dark place. The test is performed by using a 1:300,000 solution of methylene blue. One milliliter of the methylene blue solution is added to 10 mL of the milk sample in a test tube. Both the milk and methylene blue solution are mixed by shaking and then placing the mixture in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes in dark. Untreated milk can be considered as sat-isfactory if it fails to decolorize the dye within 30 minutes.Phosphatase test: Alkaline phosphatase is normally present in milk and is inactivated if pasteurization has been carried out effectively. Successful pasteurization, which kills nonspor-ing pathogens, also inactivates alkaline phosphatase. The test depends on the ability of the enzyme to liberate p-nitrophenyl phosphate after breaking down disodium p-nitrophenyl phos-phate. The test determines the amount of alkaline phospha-tase present after pasteurization by measuring the amount of p-nitrophenyl phosphate it liberates, which is known by devel-opment of a yellow color that is quantitated by a colorimeter.Turbidity test: This is the definitive test for checking the ster-ilization of milk, thereby distinguishing it from the untreated milk and milk that has been merely pasteurized. The degree of heating necessary for sterilization causes all the heat-coagulable proteins in milk to become precipitable by ammonium sulfate. If the amount of heat applied to milk is insufficient for steril-ization, some of its protein will not be precipitated by ammo-nium sulfate and will be detected by its coagulation, resulting in turbidity when a filtrate of ammonium sulfate treated-milk is boiled. The absence of turbidity indicates that the milk has been boiled or heated to at least 100\u00b0C for at least 5 min. Detection of specific pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Brucella species are the specific pathogens that can be detected in milk to know transmission of these bacteria through milk. Specific selective media for these bacteria are employed to detect these in infected milk. For example, M. tuberculosis can be isolated from centrifuged deposit of milk by inoculation in Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium or by inoculation in guinea pigs. Similarly, Brucella spp. may be isolated from milk samples by inoculating in serum dextrose agar or by intramuscular inoculation in guinea pigs. Subsequently, these bacteria are identified by their cultural and biochemical properties. Brucella spp. in infected animals can also be demonstrated by milk ring test, whey agglutination test, and demonstration of brucella antibodies in serum. Source Diseases Primarily of humans Enteric fever, cholera, bovine tuberculosis, shigellosis, and staphylococcal food poisoning Primarily of animals Tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, cowpox, Campylobacter fetus infection, and Yersinia enterocolitica infection Contamination of milk by ticks APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY Bacteriology of Air The load of microorganisms present in the air depends on whether the air is indoors or outdoors. The number of bacteria at any time is dependent on many factors, the most important of which are the number of persons present, the amount of their body movements, and the amount of disturbance of their clothing. Bacteriological Examination of Air Observations of the number of bacteria carrying particles in the air may be required in premises where safe working depends on the air's content of bacteria being kept at a very low level, e.g., operation theaters. Bacteriological examination of air is also necessary for monitoring air quality in hospital wards, store house of food and pharmacy, etc. Ideally, bacterial count should not exceed 1 per cubic foot of air in operation theater for neurosurgery, 10 per cubic foot in operation theater for other surgery, and 50 per cubic foot in homes, offices, and factories. Various methods have been devised for the measurement of bacterial content of air. A primary distinction must be drawn between the methods that measure the rate at which bacteria carrying particles are settling by gravity on to exposed surfaces and those that count the number of bacteria carrying particles in a given volume of the air. Two types of methods used for bacteriological examination of air are as follows: 1. Settle plate method 2. Slit sampler method Settle plate method Settle plate method is used for testing bacteriological quality of air in surgical operation theaters and hospital wards. In this method, Petri dishes containing nutrient agar and blood agar (for detecting pathogenic staphylococci and streptococci) are left open for half an hour to one hour. During this period of exposure, large bacteria carrying dust particles settle on to the media. The plates are then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours, fol-lowing which the colonies formed on the media are counted. Slit sampler method Slit sampler method is most efficient and convenient method used for estimation of the number of bacteria present in a mea-sured volume of air. In this method, one cubic foot volume of air is directed onto a plate containing culture medium through a slit 0.25-mm wide. The plate is then rotated so as to allow the microorganisms present in the air to spread out evenly on the medium. The culture medium is incubated and the num-ber of colonies formed on the medium indicates the number of bacteria present in the air. Chap-76.indd 628 5/14/2012 1:13:49 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 77 Introduction The term hospital infection, hospital-acquired infection, or nosocomial infection is applied to infections occurring in hos-pitalized patients who were neither infected nor were in incuba-tion at the time of their admission to the hospital. Approximately, 5% of hospitalized patients experience a nosocomial infection. Nosocomial infection represents an important public health problem in developing countries, as in developed ones today, and as a major cause of high morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences in hospitalized patients. The impact of hospital-acquired infections is considerable\u2014 the patient may need longer hospital treatment, readmission, or even further surgery, increasing the time of absence from work and use of hospital and community resources. The recent trend of shorter hospital stays means that more patients with hospital-acquired infections are presenting to general practi-tioners in the community. In addition, as home administration of intravenous medications becomes increasingly common, cannula- associated infections, once confined to hospital patients, may present in the community. Factors Affecting Hospital-Acquired Infection Hospital infections as a group differ from other community-acquired infections, both in their patient profile and the sever-ity and treatment of the disease caused by them. The factors influencing hospital-acquired infections are as follows:Hospitalized patients: Susceptible hospitalized patients are one of many factors responsible for hospital-acquired infec-tions. This is because most patients admitted in wards have impaired immunity either as a part of their preexisting disease processes or, in some instances, due to the treatment they have received in the hospital. They are therefore highly susceptible to infection.Hospital environment: The hospital environment harbors a higher load of microorganisms due to the multitudes of infected patients visiting the hospital. These organisms man-age to infect the susceptible hosts through the medium of fomites in certain cases and through human carriers in others. Contamination of food, water, and in a few cases air has also been implicated in outbreaks of hospital infections.Nosocomial Infections Antibiotics resistance: The infectious agents present in the hospital environment also possess the dubious distinction of being more difficult to treat as they are usually resistant to a range of drugs which are used commonly. The initial resis-tant strains of bacteria are present in large numbers due to the constant selection pressure exerted because of the necessary antibiotic usage inside the hospitals and these then spread, replacing the other strains in the hospital.Diagnostic or therapeutic procedures: Diagnostic or thera- peutic interventions, such as insertion of intravenous or ure-thral catheters, may introduce infection to susceptible patients and cause iatrogenic infections. There is a good chance that hospital infections are caused by the patient's own flora as many invasive procedures are carried out within the hospitals, which exposes them to this risk.Transfusion: Transfusion of blood, blood products, and intravenous fluids, if not properly screened, may transmit blood-borne pathogens to the recipient hospitalized patients. Epidemiology of Hospital-Acquired Infection Sources of Infections The sources of hospital-acquired infection may be exogenous or endogenous. Exogenous infection is most important and occurs mostly from (i ) another patient, (ii) a member of the medical and paramedical staff harboring the pathogens, or (iii) from the environment. The latter includes inanimate objects, such as medical equipments (e.g., catheters, endoscopes, cystoscopes, etc.), bed pans, and surfaces contaminated by the patient's secretions, excretions, blood, and other body fluids. It also includes hospital food, water, and environmental air (Fig. 77-1). Endogenous infection is due to microbes present in the patient's own flora present in the body. Microorganisms from these floras may cause infections in different tissues of the patient during certain surgical operations, manipulation by instruments, or nursing procedures. Microorganisms Causing Infections Though initially much of the hospital outbreaks were caused by Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter species, etc., have emerged as an impor-tant cause of these infections. Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species are also common noso- comial pathogens, because they can survive as saprophytes in the environment and are extremely hardy, developing resistance to most of the commonly used antibiotics, and in some cases managing to grow even inside bottles of disinfectant solutions. Key Points The new and emerging pathogens have several features in common: They survive for a long period in the hospital environment. They are resistant to commonly used antibiotics and disinfectants. They cause both endemic and epidemic hospital outbreaks, resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality. The microorganisms causing hospital-acquired infection are listed in Table 77-1.There is also concern that these organisms may spread from hospitals into the general community\u2014as evidence suggests that MRSA has done\u2014especially into long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, thereby causing a more serious health problem in the community. Transmission of Infections Many organisms gain entry to the body through breaches or evasion of \"first line\" body defenses. Breaches in epithelial inte-grity (e.g., surgical wounds, intravascular cannulas, and drain tubes), loss of the washing action of body fluids (e.g., because of a urinary catheter), and interference with first-line respiratory defenses (e.g., by anesthesia and endotracheal intubation) are common precursors of hospital-acquired infections. Infections can be transmitted by following ways. Air-borne transmission Hospital infections may be transmitted by air-borne droplets, dust particles, and aerosols. Inhalation of air-borne droplets or droplets' nuclei transmits Mycobacterium tuberculosis and many other respiratory pathogens. Hospital dusts generated from beddings, hospital floors, from skin by natural shed-ding of skin scales are rich sources of many pathogens, such as S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. Therefore, inhalation of these infective dust particles infections. Aerosols produced by nebulizers, humidifiers, and air condition-ing apparatus transmit certain pathogen, such as Legionella pneumophila. Transmission by direct contact Direct contact is the principal route of transmission of hospital-acquired infections. Direct contact with hands and clothings of medical personnel harboring microorganisms may transmit infection from one person to another. S. aureus and S. pyogenes are two important pathogens that are transmitted by hand contact. Certain pathogen, such as P. aeruginosa, can also be transmitted by contact with certain hospital instruments (e.g., endoscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopes, etc.) if not prop-erly disinfected. infectionsFIG. Environmental 631 Transmission by oral route Certain gastrointestinal pathogens may be transmitted by hos-pital foods served to hospitalized patients. The food may be the source of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa , E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and other pathogens. These pathogens may colonize the intes-tine and later cause infection in the susceptible patients. Transmission by parenteral route Blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), may be transmitted by transfusion of blood or blood products, through contami-nated needles or sharp instruments that have not been properly disinfected. Infections are also common among residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, special accommodation facilities, and rehabilitation hospitals. Predisposing factors include intrinsic patient factors (e.g., age and chronic medical conditions), presence of indwelling catheters, close communal living, immobility, incontinence, and frequent transfers back and forth between acute hospitals and the care facility. Urinary and respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis are com-mon, and outbreaks of scabies have been described. Common Types of Hospital Infections Common types of hospital infections can be grouped as follows: Urinary tract infections Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for as many as 40-45% of nosocomial infections. Although UTIs contribute only 10-15% to prolongation of hospital stay and to extra costs, these infections are important reservoirs and sources for spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals. Almost all noso-comial UTIs are associated with preceding instrumentation or indwelling bladder catheters, which create a 3-10% risk of infection each day. Key Points UTIs: Are usually caused by pathogens that spread up the peri-urethral space from the patient's perineum or gastrointes-tinal tract, which is seen most commonly in women. It is also caused through intraluminal contamination of uri-nary catheters, usually due to cross-infection by caregivers who are irrigating catheters or emptying drainage bags. Pathogens occasionally are transmitted from inadequately disinfected urologic equipments and rarely come from contaminated supplies (e.g., dilute aqueous benzalkonium chloride, an ineffective disinfectant). The most common UTI are E. coli, noso- comial Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and Candida. A patient who develops infection while the catheter is in place may complain of urethral discomfort, frequency, fever, and peri-catheter discharge. Infection occurring after catheter removal causes the usual symptoms of UTI. The presence of asymptomatic catheter-associated bacteriuria should not generally indicate a need for antimicrobial therapy. Possible exceptions include immunocompromised patients and patients undergoing uro-logical surgery. Asymptomatic catheter-associated candiduria often reflects vaginal or gastrointestinal carriage. When symptoms are present, the catheter should be removed; if possible, a urine sample should be sent for culture, and a short course of antibiotic therapy should be given. If the urinary catheter must be kept in place, then antibiotic therapy may relieve the symptoms, but the organism is likely to per-sist. Prolonged antibiotic therapy in the presence of an indwell-ing catheter will result in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Nosocomial pneumonia Nosocomial pneumonia accounts for 15-20% of nosocomial infections. Almost all cases of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia are caused by aspiration of endogenous or hospital-acquired oropharyngeal (and occasionally gastric) flora. Nosocomial pneumonias are associated with more deaths than are infec-tions at any other body site. The risk of dying from nosoco-mial pneumonia is affected greatly by many factors, including comorbidities, inadequate antibiotic treatment, and the involvement of specific pathogens (particularly P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter). Surveillance and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia are often problematic in hospitals because many patients, especially those in the intensive care units (ICUs), have abnormal chest roentgenographs, fever, and leukocytosis potentially induced by many causes. Key Points Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, include: Events that increase the risk of colonization by potential pathogens (e.g., prior antimicrobial therapy, contami-nated ventilator circuits or equipment, or decreased gastric acidity). Processes that increase the possibility of aspiration of oropharyngeal contents into the lower respiratory tract (e.g., intubation, decreased levels of consciousness, or pres-ence of a nasogastric tube). Diseases that reduce host defense mechanisms in the lung and permit overgrowth of aspirated pathogens (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, old age, or upper abdominal surgery). Early-onset nosocomial pneumonia, which manifests within the first 4 days of hospitalization, is most often caused by community-acquired pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneu-moniae and Haemophilus species. Late-onset pneumonia is most commonly caused by S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, K. pneumoniae, or Acinetobacter species\u2014the pathogens of increasing concern in many ICUs. Infection is polymicrobial in as many as 20-40% of cases. The role of anaerobic bacteria in ventilator-associated pneumonia is not well defined. The appropriate duration of Chap-77.indd 631 5/14/2012 1:13:03 PMSection VI Chapter 77632 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY therapy for nosocomial pneumonia, although usually ranges from 10 to 21 days, is not well studied. Surgical wound infections Surgical wound infections account for nearly 30% of all hospi-tal infections. These occur in up to 10% of patients undergoing clean surgery; the incidence varies with complexity of surgery, intrinsic patient risk, and surgical skills. Most surgical wound infections result from contamination of the surgical wound with the patient's own flora or that of operating-room personnel or environment at the time of the surgery. Postoperative hematogenous seeding of the wound site is uncommon. The common clinical features of surgical wound infection are localized pain, redness, and discharge. Fever that occurs within 4 weeks of surgery, without other localizing features, is likely to be caused by infection at the surgical site. Superficial wound infection may resolve with or without antibiotics. Deeper or organ-space infection may require imaging for diag-nosis, surgical drainage, and antimicrobial therapy guided by culture of purulent material. The likely causative organisms of surgical wound infections depend on the location and type of surgery. MRSA is most common cause in some hospitals. Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., E. coli) are more common causes of infection following gastro-intestinal or genitourinary tract surgery. Diagnosis of Hospital-Acquired Infections Diagnosis of hospital-acquired infections is made by routine bacteriological methods, such as direct demonstration of microorganisms in specimens by microscopy, isolation by cul-ture, and testing bacterial isolates for their antibiotics sensitiv-ity pattern. The specimens are usually sampled from possible sources of infections, such as environment, inanimate objects, water, air, food, hospital personnel, etc. The source of infection may be traced by performing phage typing, bacteriocin typing, biotyping, or molecular typing. Prevention and Control of Hospital-Acquired Infections Up to a third of hospital-acquired infections are preventable. The two main arms of prevention are stopping the develop-ment of antibiotic resistance and preventing the spread of resistant organisms between patients. Many of the prin-ciples for preventing spread of hospital-acquired organisms are well known. There is no single successful recipe, and the approach for individual hospitals is usually based on the epidemiology of the organism and the resources available. For example, the most important measures for prevent-ing nosocomial UTIs are ( a) the placement of catheters only when absolutely necessary and not solely for the con-venience of caregivers, (b ) the use of aseptic technique for catheter insertion and for urinary tract instrumentation, (c) the manipulation and opening of drainage systems as infre- quently as possible, and (d ) the removal of catheters as soon as feasible. Strategies shown to decrease the risk of surgical wound infection include (a) antibiotic prophylaxis, (b) short preopera-tive hospital stay, (c) optimization of patient's risk factors (e.g., diabetes control), and (d) surveillance of surgical-site infections with feedback to the operating teams. Components of a pro-gram to prevent hospital-acquired infection are many. These are listed in Box 77-1. Active Surveillance for Hospital-Acquired Infection Hospital surveillance is the key for successful hospital infection control. This includes prospective collection of high-quality data, their analysis, and timely feedback to healthcare practi-tioners. To achieve this, hospital surveillance systems need to be prospective, targeted, and risk-adjusted, to use validated definitions and methods, and to be open to valid inter-hospital comparison. A further recent advance in hospital infection surveillance is the use of molecular methods to identify and type organisms, thereby clarifying the clonal or polyclonal nature of apparent outbreaks. Molecular testing has confirmed that some appar-ently \"endemic\" infections are caused by MRSA strains and other bacteria.

Therefore, every hospital should have an infection control committee. The major responsibilities of the committee should be the control of hospital-acquired infection and monitoring of hygienic practices in the hospital. The committee essentially is a multidisciplinary team con- sisting of clinicians, infection control practitioners, a hospi-tal epidemiologist, biostatistician, medical records officer, infectious diseases physician, blood bank officer, and micro-biologist. The committee is usually chaired by the medical superintendent with the medical microbiologist being the member-secretary. The committee (a) reviews regularly the infection control activities of the hospital, (b) monitors emergence of drug resis-tance, (c) formulates the antibiotics policy of the hospital, (d) recommends suitable sterilization and disinfection procedures in a hospital, and (e) maintains data on the incidence and types of infections and antibiotics susceptibility patterns of the com-mon prevalent pathogens. Chap-77.indd 633 5/14/2012 1:13:04 PMMycobacterium Leprae43 78 Introduction A vast amount of waste is generated in the process of health-care, research, testing, or related procedures on human beings or animals conducted in hospitals, clinics, labs, or similar establishments. This waste is called biomedical waste. Due to the presence of a higher concentration of infec- tious and other such hazardous substances, this form of waste requires special attention for its safe disposal. If the waste finds its way back to the community, the results would be disastrous to say the least. It can act as a source of infection to residents or visitors of hospitals, and the chemicals contained in the waste may seep into the surrounding soil and contaminate wells and tanks, thereby polluting them. Most governments in the world have laws and guidelines ensuring that institutions where biomedical waste is generated take appropriate measures for the safe disposal of such waste. An ordinance to this effect was promulgated in India in 1998 under which the institutes where such waste is generated have been held legally responsible for the safe disposal of biomedical waste. Types of Biomedical Waste Handling of biomedical waste is increasingly associated with the risk of laboratory-acquired infections. Most of these infec-tions include those caused by hepatitis B virus, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Francisella tularensis, Shigella species, and Brucella species. Biomedical wastes are of the following types:Human anatomical waste: This consists of human tissues, organs, and body parts, but does not include teeth, hair, and nails.Animal waste: This consists of all animal tissues, organs, body parts, carcasses, bedding, fluid, blood and blood products, items saturated or dripping with blood, body fluids contami-nated with blood, and body fluids removed for diagnosis or removed during surgery, treatment, or autopsy, unless a trained person has certified that the waste does not contain the viruses and agents listed in Risk Group 4. This excludes teeth, hair, nails, hooves, and feathers.Microbiology laboratory waste: This consists of labora- tory cultures, stocks or specimens of microorganisms, live or attenuated vaccines, and human or animal cell cultures used in Biomedical Waste Management research and laboratory material that have come into contact with any of these.Human blood and body fluid waste: This consists of blood and blood products, items saturated or dripping with blood, human body fluids contaminated with blood, and body fluids removed for diagnosis during surgery, treatment, or autopsy. This does not include urine or feces.Waste sharps: Waste sharps are clinical and laboratory materials consisting of needles, syringes, blades, or laboratory glass capable of causing punctures or cuts.Cytotoxic waste: The term is commonly used to refer to pharmaceuticals used in treating cancer, e.g., antineoplastics or chemotherapy agents.The categories of biomedical waste as defined by the Pollution Control Board are listed in Table 78-1. Waste Treatment and Disposal Waste treatment and disposal forms a very important compo-nent of the proper waste management program of the hospital. Segregation of infectious waste from noninfectious waste is the most important stage required before treatment and disposal of biomedical wastes. This is required to protect the health of medical personnel coming in contact with infectious biomedi-cal wastes (Table 78-2). Infectious wastes include microbiology and biotechnology waste, waste sharps, animal wastes, solid wastes, and liquid wastes as mentioned above. These are segregated and collected in different colored plastic bags (Fig. 78-1, Color Photo 72): Key Points Black plastic bags are used for incineration and solid chemical noninfectious wastes. Yellow plastic bags are used for infectious nonsharp substances. Blue or white bags are used for disposal of plastics and sharp instruments. Red bags are used for infectious nonsharp wastes. Waste Treatment There are various methods of treatment of biomedical wastes and are as follows: Chap-78.indd 634 5/14/2012 1:12:25 PMSection VI Chapter 78BIOMEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT 635 Steam autoclaving: Steam autoclaving is an appropriate method for treating microbiology laboratory waste, human blood and body fluid waste (if applicable), waste sharps, and nonanatomical animal wastes. It must not be used for treating either human or animal anatomical waste. Personnel who operate steam autoclaves need to be thoroughly trained in the use of the equipment. The effective-ness of decontamination of biomedical waste is dependent upon the temperature to which the waste is subjected as well as the length of time it is exposed to steam. Because the waste is heated by steam penetration and heat conduction, all air must be displaced and containers holding the waste must have good steam permeability. The penetration of steam into the waste is crucial to the effectiveness of the autoclaving process. For this reason, particular attention must be given to packaging to ensure effective steam penetration. Special emphasis is given to the type of plastic bags used in the autoclave. Some bags impede steam penetration, while others may melt during the autoclave cycle. Plastic bags, therefore, are assessed under actual working conditions to ensure their effectiveness and integrity throughout the auto-clave cycle. Organic wastes containing oxidizing agents like sodium hypochlorite or solvents are not autoclaved due to their poten-tial for explosion.Chemical decontamination: Chemical decontamination is recommended for treating microbiology laboratory waste, human blood, and body fluid waste. It is not used for treating anatomical waste. Waste sharps may be chemically decontami-nated; however, the sharps may not be completely sterilized unless mechanical shredding is involved. Shredding is only done where the shredder is integral to an incinerator, which is sealed to prevent any release. Direct incineration is the preferred disposal method for waste sharps. If chemical decontamination is used, the following factors should be considered: type of microorganism, degree of contamination, type of disinfectant used, and con-centration and quantity of disinfectant. Other relevant factors include temperature, pH, degree of mixing, and the length of time the disinfectant is in contact with the contaminated waste. Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) is often used as an intermediate-level disinfectant, with the undiluted commercial product normally being a 5.25% solution of sodium hypochlorite (50,000 mg/L of free available chlo-rine). If a diluted hypochlorite solution is used, it should be made up daily in order to prevent loss of germicidal action.Incineration: Incineration is a process in which combustible materials are converted into noncombustible residue or ash, Categories Nature of biomedical wastes Category No. 1 Human anatomical waste (human tissues, organs, and body parts)Category No. 2 Animal waste (animal tissues, organs, body parts, carcasses, bleeding parts, fluid, blood and experimental animals used in research, waste generated by veterinary hospitals/colleges, discharge from hospitals, animal houses) Category No. 3 Microbiology and biotechnology waste (wastes from laboratory cultures, stocks or specimens of microorganisms live or attenuated vaccines, human and animal cell culture used in research and infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories, wastes from production of biologicals, toxins, dishes and devices used for transfer of cultures) Category No. 4 Waste sharps (needles, syringes, scalpels blades, glass, etc., which may cause puncture and cuts). This includes both used and unused sharps) Category No. 5 Discarded medicines and cytotoxic drugs (wastes comprising outdated contaminated and discarded medicines)Category No. 6 Solid waste (items contaminated with blood and body fluids including cotton, dressings, soiled plaster casts, line beddings, other material contaminated with blood) Category No. 7 Solid waste (waste generated from disposable items other than the waste sharps, such as tubing, catheters, intravenous sets, etc.)Category No. 8 Liquid waste (waste generated from laboratory and washing, cleaning, housekeeping, and disinfecting activities)Category No. 9 Incineration ash (ash from incineration of any biomedical waste)Category No. 10 Chemical waste (chemicals used in production of biologicals, chemicals used in disinfection, as insecticides, etc.)TABLE 78-1 Categories of biomedical waste as defined by the Pollution Control Board Color coding Type of containers Waste category Treatment options Yellow Plastic bag 1-3, 6 Incineration/deep burial Red Disinfected container/plastic container4, 7 Autoclaving/microwaving/chemical treatment, and destruction/shredding Black Plastic bag 5, 9, 10 (Solid) Disposal in secured landfillTABLE 78-2 Color coding and type of containers used for disposal of biomedical wastes Chap-78.indd 635 5/14/2012 1:12:27 PMSection VI Chapter 78636 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY achieving a reduction of 90% by volume or 75% by weight when the incinerator is properly operated. Incineration has tradi-tionally been the principal method used by hospitals, medical colleges, and other healthcare facilities providers to process their anatomical and nonanatomical biomedical wastes. To date, incineration is the only disposal technology proven to be capable of handling all components of the biomedical waste stream.Microwave treatment: Radiations produced by microwave are increasingly used nowadays for treatment of infectious hospital wastes. The microwaves heat the biological wastes to a temperature of 97-100\u00b0C in a 40-45 minutes cycle. The advantage of the method is that it is not associated with any hazardous emissions, but it cannot be used to treat anatomical body parts and tissues.Plasma torch: Waste treatment by plasma torch produces a very high temperature that is very useful for treatment of biological wastes. It is a very safe method, although it is highly expensive. Disposal of Biomedical Wastes Landfill, deep burial, and sewage are different methods used for safe disposal of biomedical wastes. Landfill or deep burial\u2014although is a safe method for disposal of sharps, and also for products of chemical disinfection\u2014requires the presence of large areas of uninhabited land. Trenches are dug where the waste is buried and are covered with lime. FIG. 78-1. Different containers used for disposal of biomedical wastes.

The incidence of dis-eases, such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), poliomyelitis, and tetanus, has declined dramatically as vaccination has become more common. Vaccination is a cost-effective weapon for disease prevention. Use of vaccines has contributed solely in the eradication of small-pox, one of mankind's long-standing and most terrible scourges. Since October 1977, not a single naturally acquired smallpox case has been reported anywhere in the world. Other diseases like diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis, also known as \"vaccine preventable diseases\" have been successfully brought down to negligible levels in most devel-oped nations and in some cases in the developing nations as well. Immunity to infectious microorganisms can be achieved by active or passive immunization. In each case, immunity can be acquired either by natural processes (usually by transfer from mother to fetus or by previous infection by the organism) or by artificial means, such as injection of antibodies or vaccines. The agents used for inducing passive immunity include antibodies from humans or animals, whereas active immunization is achieved by inoculation with microbial pathogens that induce immunity but do not cause disease or with antigenic components from the pathogens. Active Immunization Active immunization can be achieved by natural infection with a microorganism, or it can be acquired artificially by admin-istration of a vaccine. In active immunization, as the name implies, the immune system plays an active role. Proliferation of antigen-reactive T and B cells results in the formation of mem-ory cells. Active immunization with various types of vaccines has played an important role in the reduction of deaths from infectious diseases, especially among children. Vaccines may be (a) live attenuated, (b) killed, or (c) in the form of toxoids. Key Points Two forms of immunoprophylaxis: (i) Routine immunization\u2014used for all children. (ii) Immunization of individuals or selected groups\u2014used for individuals or groups exposed to risk of specific diseases.Live Attenuated Vaccines These vaccines, as the name suggests, contain live attenuated organisms that have lost their pathogenicity but have anti-genicity. The attenuated organisms are the suspensions of live organisms with reduced virulence. These organisms multiply in the body and thereby provide a continuous antigenic stimulus, resulting in production of protective antibodies. Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG); smallpox rubella (MMR) vac-cine; and yellow fever vaccine are some of the examples of live vaccines. These live vaccines are usually contraindicated for use in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leukemia, malignancies, etc. Killed Inactivated Vaccines These vaccines contain killed pathogens, hence do not replicate in body. At least three doses of killed vaccine followed by a booster dose are essential to confer protective immunity. Typhoid, cholera, pertussis, pneumococcal, rabies, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines are the examples of killed attenuated vaccines. Toxoids Toxoids are modified toxins, which have retained their antigenicity but have lost their toxicity. Key Points Toxoids are given to confer protection against diseases that are caused by production of toxins. Two toxoids most widely used for immunization are teta-nus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine is a triple vac-cine, which consists of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and pertussis killed vaccine. Adsorption of toxoid to a mineral carrier, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate enhances antigenicity of toxoids. This is because these adsorbed toxoids remain longer in a depot after injection and continue to stimulate immune system of host for a longer period of time. These are usually prepared by treating toxins with formalin.Immunoprophylaxis Chap-79.indd 637 5/14/2012 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY Subunit Vaccines Subunit vaccines are specialized vaccines that are prepared by purifying the fragments of major immunogenic components of microorganisms and are produced by recombinant DNA technology (hepatitis B subunit vaccine). Immunization Schedule WHO Immunization Program Following the successful global eradication of small-pox in 1975 through effective vaccination programs and strengthened surveillance, the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was launched in India in 1978 to con-trol other vaccine preventable diseases. Initially, six diseases were selected: diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, typhoid, and childhood tuberculosis. The aim was to cover 80% of all the infants. Subsequently, the program was uni-versalized and renamed as Universal Immunization Program (UIP) in 1985. Measles vaccine was included in the program and typhoid vaccine was discontinued. The UIP was intro-duced in a phased manner from 1985 to cover all districts in the country by 1990, targeting all infants with the primary immunization schedule and all pregnant women with tetanus toxoid immunization. Key Points Universal Immunization Program: It envisages achieving and sustaining universal immuniza-tion coverage in infants with three doses of DPT and OPV and one dose each of measles vaccine and BCG, and in preg-nant women with two primary doses or one booster dose of tetanus toxoid. It also requires a reliable cold-chain system for storing and transporting vaccines and attaining self-sufficiency in the production of all required vaccines. In 1992, the UIP became a part of the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme (CSSM), and in 1997, it became an important component of the Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH). The cold-chain system was strengthened and training programs were launched extensively throughout the country. Intensified polio eradication activities were started in 1995-1996 under the Polio Eradication Programme, begin-ning with National Immunization Days (NIDs) and active sur-veillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). The Polio Eradication Programme was set up with the assistance of the National Polio Surveillance Project. National Immunization Schedule National immunization schedule is mentioned in Table 79-1. EPI's immunization schedule is mentioned in Table 79-2.Passive Immunization Passive immunization is carried out by administration of human and animal sera, which serve as the readymade source of pre-pared antibodies against a particular pathogen. These are given to an individual to confer immediate protection against particu-lar pathogen. The immunity, however, is of short duration.Age Vaccine Route of administration Primary vaccinationAt birth BCGOPV\u2014zero 5 years DT Intramuscular 10 years TT Intramuscular 16 years TT Intramuscular Pregnant womenGestational periodAs early as possible during pregnancy (first contact)TT\u20141st dose Intramuscular 1 month after 1st dose TT\u20142nd dose Intramuscular If vaccinated, within OPV, oral polio DT, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids; TT, tetanus toxoid.TABLE 79-1Universal immunization schedule in India Age Disease Vaccine At birth Tuberculosis, polio BCG, OPV 6 weeks Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus; polio DPT-1, OPV-1 10 weeks Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus; polio OPV-2 14 weeks Diphtheria, pertussis, OPV-3 human immunoglobulins include (a ) pooled human immunoglobulin, and (b ) specific hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Pooled human immunoglobulin Pooled human immunoglobulin is prepared from normal human serum containing a high concentration of a particu-lar antibody. It is usually used for short-term prophylaxis of hepatitis A, measles, etc. Specific hyperimmune immunoglobulin Specific hyperimmune immunoglobulin is prepared from patients convalescing from the disease or from individuals actively immunized against a specific disease. These hyperim-mune sera are available against a variety of diseases. Examples are human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) against rabies, human tetanus immunoglobulin (HTIG) against tetanus, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) against zoster. These hyperimmune sera are usually given intramuscularly. They are usually not given shortly before or after active immu-nization in order to avoid inhibition of immune responses. Animal Sera Animal sera are prepared in animals. These sera rich in anti-bodies are produced by active immunization of animals, such as horses. Antitetanus serum and antivenom sera are examples of such sera used against tetanus and snake bites, respectively. Disadvantages of these sera are that in some recipients they may cause serum sickness and anaphylaxis; moreover, they are eliminated much rapidly from humans. Combined Active and Passive Immunization Combined active and passive immunization is often carried out to confer slowly developing immunity and immediate passive immunity, respectively, against certain diseases, such as diphtheria, tetanus, and rabies. Individual Immunization The vaccines mentioned in the universal immunization sched-ule are selected on the basis of economic considerations and the epidemiology of infectious diseases in the region. But there are many vaccines available, which can be used to supplement the schedule depending on the individual cases and affordability. Hepatitis B Vaccine Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted from one person to another through blood and body fluids, and primarily infects the liver. Healthcare workers and others exposed to infected blood or body fluids are at high risk for infection. Worldwide, it is most commonly spread to infants by their infected mothers. Approximately 90% of infants who are infected from their mothers at birth, and between 30% and 50% of those infected before age of 5 years, become chronic HBV carriers, while peo-ple who are newly infected as adults have only a 6-10% risk of chronic infection. For these reasons, hepatitis B immuniza-tions are recommended for routine administration at birth. Vaccination with at least three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. All newborns should receive a dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. For children between the ages of 6 weeks and 7 years, HBV in combination with the DTP and inactivated polio vaccines may be given. HBV and Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) conjugate vaccine may be given to children between the ages of 6 weeks and 15 months. Dialysis patients and immunocompromised people may require additional doses. MMR Vaccine Measles vaccine is usually given with the mumps and rubella vaccines in children 12-15 months of age and older. Two doses of MMR vaccine are recommended for all children on or after the first birthday, including those who previously received the monovalent measles vaccine. The first dose is generally given at 12-15 months of age, and the second dose is generally given at 4-6 years of age. There must be a minimum of 4 weeks between the two doses. The second dose of MMR vaccine provides an added safeguard against all three diseases, but is recommended primarily to prevent outbreaks of measles. Students who are exposed to an outbreak but have not already received two doses of the vaccine and who do not have other proof of immunity may be excluded from school for the entire duration of the outbreak or are required to receive the measles vaccination. The second dose of the measles vaccine series is effective when given as early as 1 month after the first dose, and this schedule is used when protection is needed quickly. Ninety-five percent of those who receive the MMR or monovalent measles vaccine at 12 months of age or older become immune after the first dose. After the second dose, 99.7% of those immunized are protected. Immunity is lifelong. There are hypotheses that the MMR vaccine causes autism. However, the best available science indicates that the develop-ment of autism is not related to the use of the MMR or any other vaccine. One small study seemed to postulate such a link, but has subsequently been disproved by many other larger studies. Ten of the thirteen authors of that study later retracted from their suggestion of a link between MMR vaccine and autism. Chap-79.indd 639 5/14/2012 1:11:52 PMSection VI Chapter 79640 APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY Typhoid Vaccine Two newer vaccines, recently, have replaced the older vaccine used in typhoid fever. These vaccines are: an oral live attenuated vaccine using a weakened strain of Salmonella Typhi that is given orally and a parenteral capsular polysaccharide vaccine that is given by injection. The oral typhoid vaccine can be administered to children 6 years of age or older and to adults. It is given in a total dosage of four capsules, one capsule taken orally every other day. A booster dose is needed every 5 years for people who continue to remain at risk. The polysaccharide typhoid vaccine is given by injection to children older than 2 years of age. One shot is enough to provide protection. A booster dose is needed every 2 years for people who remain at risk for exposure. The efficacy of the two licensed vaccines ranges from 50% to 80%. The oral vaccine has shown a protective efficacy of 62% for at least 7 years after the last dose.
