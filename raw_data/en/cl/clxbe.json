Homeopathy treats each person as a unique individual with the intention of promoting their healing ability. A homeopath chooses the most appropriate medicine based on the individual's specific symptoms and personal level of health. The Benefits of Homeopathy - Homeopathic treatment works with your body's healing powers to bring about improved health and wellbeing. - You are treated as an individual, not as an assortment of disease labels. - Homeopathy addresses all your symptoms at all levels of your being\u2014spiritual, emotional, mental and physical and determines the 'like cures like' match for them. - Homeopathically prepared remedies, providing the minimum dose, are gentle, subtle and powerful.
