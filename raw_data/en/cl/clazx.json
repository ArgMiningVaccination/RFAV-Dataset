You may experience itchy eyes, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, loss of taste and smell, sinus problems and sneezing. Mainly related to Tree pollens, pollen allergies are an unfortunate immune response to harmless substances. Forty years ago, allergies and asthma were relatively rare diseases. Today, almost one in three French people are concerned by pollen allergies and suffer from rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane). According to the National Health Safety Agency (Anses), 30% of adults are concerned and nearly 20% of children. In addition, people with pollen allergies are three times more likely to develop asthma. Why have allergies become a greater concern in just a few generations? Scientists have speculated that this may be related to incomplete immune programming due to the use of vaccines, antibiotics and antiseptics. However, they may overlook the obvious cause: a change in the foods people eat, leading to a pro-inflammatory change in immune responses. Medicines in Over-the-counter remedies will reduce your symptoms, but some home natural remedies can also relieve you for allergies. There is no definitive cure for pollen allergies, but there are preventive measures you can take to minimise your contact with pollen. We have divided our advice into four clear categories to help you control your allergies. Regularly cleaning your carpets, rugs, etc. prevents the spread of airborne pollen. If people are constantly coming in and out of your home, they take the pollutants from the outside air with them. By cleaning regularly, you remove allergens from your home, reducing the likelihood of irritating your symptoms during this pollen season. It is well known that animals come in and out of the house, carrying with them a host of allergens, mites, dust. Clean and brush your pet regularly, and above all, do not let it sleep in the bed of the allergic person. On a hot, sunny day, it can be tempting to hang your clothes outside to dry rather than clutter up your home. However, drying your clothes outside will cause wind-blown pollen to stick to your clothes and contaminate your skin. You must continue to ventilate even in the pollen season to renew your indoor air. The concentration of pollen in the air is lower in cooler temperatures: open the window before 9am or after 8pm.. For most of us, going outdoors is an inevitable part of the day. If you are concerned about these allergies, here are some ways to reduce your risk. In the face of the health crisis caused by the Covid-19 epidemic, it is recommended to wear a mask. The use of an anti-pollution mask offers you protection against fine particles, dust and other atmospheric contaminants, but also against pollen or other allergens. You knew it was coming... Like all forms of air pollution, cigarette smoke will irritate the lining of your airways and aggravate your allergies. You may not have considered that what you eat and drink can have an impact on your hay fever, but it can. One of the best nutrients for hay fever is a flavanol called quercetin, which studies have shown can suppress the production of histamine (a chemical your body produces in response to an infection). The food rich in quercetin are vegetables such as green vegetables (rich in vitamin C), berries, beans and apples. Eating foods rich in beta-carotene (carrots, spinach) and omega 3 (oily fish) will relieve your symptoms such as than a blocked nose. Try chamomile or nettle tea to relieve your symptoms, as both have antihistamine and anti-inflammatory properties. You can also take food compliments based on quail eggs. These supplements help to maintain the effectiveness of the immune system to contribute to our body's resistance. It is advisable to follow a desensitization treatment a few months before the period of pollen peaks. Also, to relieve your allergies, your doctor may advise you to use essential oils. Essential oils are effective in the treatment of hay fever, particularly in synergy with the essential oils of Tarragon, Eucalyptus and Chamomile. Be careful with the use of essential oils and ask your pharmacist for advice. Natural environments are rich in negative ions. This is precisely the principle on which the air ionizer is based on. However, do you know how this technology manages to capture the pollution particles contained in the indoor air to purify your home? In December 2019, a respiratory virus of the Coronavirus family appeared in the Wuhan region of China and has now spread to all continents. Purifying indoor air while protecting your health and the planet is possible! Say goodbye to filters and make way for negative ions: choose an eco-responsible air purifier that will easily reduce energy and resource consumption. "}
