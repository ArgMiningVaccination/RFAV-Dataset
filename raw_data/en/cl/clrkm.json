You don't always need to be getting stuff done. Sometimes it's perfectly okay, and absolutely necessary, to shut down, kick back, and do nothing. - Lori Deschene Something to Think About - Balance is not something you find. It's something you create. Thy word is thy lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. (Psalm 119:105) Welcome back to Renew Inspiration! Today, let's talk about spiritual balance. How often do you read and study God's Word? Do you just read your favorite Bible verse, pray, then move on with your day? In order to find spiritual balance in our lives, it is important to schedule quality time to not only read God's Word, but also to write down our personal thoughts about the verses read and to determine how we can apply the verses to our own lives. Here's my suggestions for beginning this spiritual journey: Set a time to better engage in God's Word and stick to your plan. Gather your materials, such as Bible, Notebook/Journal, Pens, Highlighters, Sticky Notes, Bible Concordance, Dictionary, etc. Designate a quiet space with no distractions, such as cellphones, televisions, people, noise, etc. You may want to play some soft music in the background to set a relaxing mood. Make sure your study area is free of clutter and well lit. Pray and meditate while studying God's Word to open your mind and heart. Speak to God often to strengthen your relationship and ask Him to direct your study time. My Motto - Each day I need to let God's Word interrupt me, rearrange me and redirect me. To strive for spiritual balance, it is important to face each day with a positive attitude. Dig deep inside to strive for new opportunities that surround us every day. Focus on right now and not what ifs. Believe it or not, even as I type these words, it seems easier said than done. I realize it will not be easy for some, but to move to a better place in life, we sometimes need to place ourselves in uncomfortable situations and/or conversations. Involve yourself with like-minded individuals who build you up and not tear you down. Here's some ways to help you find spiritual balance within your life: Write your thoughts and feelings in a journal Read and be grounded in God's Word Meditate and be prayerful Practice yoga and stretch routines Read inspirational and spiritual books Set some attainable goals for yourself Post positive quotes where you can read them daily Recite positive affirmations throughout your day My mind and body are in perfect balance. I am a harmonious being. - Louise Hay When thinking about spiritual balance, it is important to prepare your mind, body and spirit for the journey. From experience, it is difficult to have spiritual balance without first getting the mind ready to receive our spiritual gifts from God. So, in addition to reading and studying God's Word, it is also important to practice meditation regularly. Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses his or her mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Remember, practice makes perfect so make sure to plan for meditation every day. It's important to start with good breathing techniques when doing your meditation. In addition, create a peaceful and safe space where you will not be distracted during your meditation. It is important to let go of any and all frustrations throughout the meditation process. Meditation, when done correctly, offers many benefits throughout his or her weight loss journey as well. Benefits of meditation includes, but not limited to: Reduces stress and anxiety Reduces impulsivity, cravings, and addictions Increases resilience in hard times Increases happiness and optimism Helps create loving, harmonious relationships Increases focus, creativity, and life satisfaction Increases memory, compassion, and productivity Produces a deep state of peace and well-being How to Meditate: Sit Still - Just sit still and close your eyes - Outer stillness will lead to inner stillness Relax - It's not a process - You just let go and surrender Pay Attention - To nothing in particular - Just be awake and focus on self-awareness Spiritual Balance Quotes: By God's wise designing we are wonderfully made, every part essential and in perfect balance laid. - Anon Spiritual balance is the principle that allows the mind to be still. You cannot expect the world to settle down, everything to work out, in order for you to be happy. You have to get control of your mind. - Frederick Lenz Balance your life with spiritual experiences that remind and prepare you for continued, daily ministering to others. - M. Russell Ballard My Journal Prompts - Time for Reflection The body benefits from movement, and the mind benefits from stillness. - Sakyong MIpham What are your priorities in life? What do you need to be content? Write down something that you want to remember. Why is it important to you? Write 5 things you would like to do more and make a plan to do them. What do you love about yourself? Identify your strengths and weaknesses. What are you thankful for? Why? What are my values? What do I believe in? Identify one way you would like to grow in the next year. Believe in yourself today, tomorrow and forever!
