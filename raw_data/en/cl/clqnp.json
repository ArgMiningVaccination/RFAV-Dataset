As a holistic practitioner, Dr. Mukalel believes that all the facets of your life contribute to your overall well-being and that each individual health problem is part of a larger, more complex system. Following these principles, he evaluates your physical, emotional, and spiritual health along with nutritional and other lifestyle elements. When Dr. Mukalel identifies a problem in any area, it's integrated into a holistic treatment plan that incorporates specific lifestyle changes and science-based therapies. Each person's treatment is individualized to achieve optimal results. What does holistic medicine look like in practice? Here's an example of holistic medicine in practice. Most patients with a headache take an over-the-counter pain reliever and enjoy temporary relief from the pain. But the medication only treats the symptom and not the true source of the problem, so your headache will return. A holistic approach identifies and treats the cause of your pain, a process that requires time and communication. Dr. Mukalel begins by asking you to keep a pain journal. For two weeks, you'll track your headaches, noting what triggered the pain, the severity and type of pain, and how long it lasted. At the same time, Dr. Mukalel talks with you about issues like stress, your diet, and the quality of your sleep. He also thoroughly evaluates your physical health. Then he reviews all the information, treats any underlying medical conditions, and takes a scientific approach to all the other potential causes by changing one variable at a time. For example, treatment for a cervicogenic headache may combine radiofrequency ablation to temporarily stop the pain with postural realignment physical therapy, meditation, and a behavioral plan to improve your sleep. Your headache problem is eliminated by providing multiple treatments that target all the sources. What services will I receive with holistic medicine? Dr. Mukalel integrates conventional and alternative therapies, choosing the best treatments for each patient's health care needs. He also specializes in innovative treatment options that aren't available in most medical practices, including interventional procedures and regenerative therapies such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate concentrate injections.
