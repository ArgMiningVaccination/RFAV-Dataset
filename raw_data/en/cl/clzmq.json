My name is Jenny 2 Culler. Is this -- okay. There we go. 3 Hi. My name is Jenny Culler. I have a 4 preliminary question that I think we all need 5 to know and then a real question. 6 First, are the questions right now going 7 to be part of the public comment record; or 8 are those only the formal comment questions 9 that will be part of the record considered by 10 DHS as they go to the final EIS?11 MS. COGHILL: The questions that you're 12 posing right now are part of the record that 13 the court reporter is recording every piece 14 of this meeting. The -- if you have a 15 comment during the public comment period and 16 you have a question in your comment, under 17 the National Environmental Policy Act we 18 won't be answering that because we have to go 19 back and do further scientific analysis to 20 produce the answer. 21 So right now we're asking if you have a 22 question, make sure it's focused on the 23 presentation for clarification purposes. 24 JENNY CULLER: But the questions we ask 25 now will not be considered in the comments 1| 4.2 cont.| 1| 4.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 5 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS is committed to providing public access to pertinent information and has conducted a robust public participation program subsequent to the completion of the competitive site selection process, which is described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. To date, DHS has provided two opportunities for the public to provide comment and input to the environmental impact analyses presented in the NBAF EIS. An initial scoping comment period of 60 days followed the issuance of a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS. Once a draft of the EIS was published, another notice was issued that provided 60 days for comment. The 60 day period for public review and comment on the NBAF Draft EIS, extended from June 27 through August 25, 2008. DHS accepted comments submitted by various means: mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, NBAF Web page, and public meetings. DHS gave equal consideration to all comments, regardless of how or where they were received. All comments received during the public comment periods have been considered in this NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3760 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 39 1 that DHS will then review? 2 MR. JOHNSON: All of them will be 3 reported, and then we will go back and --4 JENNY CULLER: I understand. 5 MR. JOHNSON: Yeah. 6 JENNY CULLER: And they'll be listed and 7 then answered? 8 MR. JOHNSON: Yeah. 9 JENNY CULLER: Okay. My question is: 10 Can you please describe how the zoonotic 11 diseases that will be studied at the NBAF 12 manifest themselves in an infected human? 13 DR. KAPPES: We will not do research on 14 how they affect humans. That's a 15 responsibility of CDC. So we will only do 16 work on animals. 17 JENNY CULLER: But the question was how 18 do they affect humans. 19 DR. KAPPES: How do they affect -- some 20 of the pathogens have the capability of 21 affecting animals and pathogens. Matter of 22 fact, this is information out of the CDC. 23 I believe that the last couple of years 24 about 70 percent of those diseases that -- 25 human diseases, 70 percent of those also cont.| 1| 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 6 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.0 Information on the human symptoms of zoonotic pathogen exposure to humans for Rift Valley Fever Virus, Nipah Virus, Hendra Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis Virus is provided in Section 3.14.1 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3761 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 40 1 caused disease in animals. So there's a lot 2 of overlap between the diseases. 3 JENNY CULLER: I was asking for a 4 description of the physical manifestation of 5 the diseases. 6 DR. KAPPES: Well, you'd have to ask 7 specifically on the pathogen, because there's 8 a lot of -- the symptoms vary depending on 9 the pathogen. 10 JENNY CULLER: Nipah.11 DR. KAPPES: I'd like to turn that over 12 to my USDA counterpart, Beth Lopner (phonetic 13 spelling). 14 BETH LOPNER: I'm Beth Lopner with USDA. 15 With regard to Nipah Virus, it could be 16 flu-like symptoms that would then have a 17 neurologic component as far as an 18 encephalitis. Rift Valley Fever would be 19 similar with flu-like symptoms and could have 20 an encephalitis aspect, as well as some 21 ocular effects. 22 Thank you. 23 MS. COGHILL: Sir, your question? 24 DANIEL COTTAR: What are the other four 25 things you decided not to mention in your cont.| 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 7 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3762 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 41 1 presentation, the other four viruses or 2 diseases? So far I've got Foot and Mouth, 3 Rift Valley, Nipah -- actually I've only got 4 those three. 5 So what are the others? Can you like 6 list them real quick. 7 MR. JOHNSON: There are eight research 8 diseases, Chuck. Foot and Mouth Disease 9 and -- 10 MR. PERGLER: Okay. Of the eight five 11 were not carried through for detailed 12 analysis. It would be African Swine Fever, 13 Classical Swine Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, 14 Contagious Bovine. What do you say -- 15 DR. KAPPES: Hendra. 16 MR. PERGLER: And Hendra and Nipah 17 virus. 18 DANIEL COTTAR: Okay. So that's --19 MR. PERGLER: I'm sorry. We are studying 20 the Nipah.21 DANIEL COTTAR: Could you say those again 22 slowly, please. 23 DR. KAPPES: Hendra. 24 DANIEL COTTAR: Okay. I've got Japanese Encephalitis, cont.| 3| 19.2cont.| 2| 19.0 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 8 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3763 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 42 1 Classical Swine Fever, African Swine Fever 2 and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia. 3 DANIEL COTTAR: Okay. African. 4 Also, are you going -- are you getting a 5 lot of opposition at the other sites more or 6 less than here? Could you comment on that. 7 MR. JOHNSON: Yeah, I sure can. 8 We are -- part of what we're doing is to 9 get input on the EIS. Certainly, you know, 10 all comments are welcome from people, 11 especially with a view on the facility. You 12 know, we're in the process of assessing all 13 of that input, if you will. 14 I will say that Georgia has been very 15 vocal both ways, more than some of the other 16 sites. 17 (Applause.)18 MR. JOHNSON: But, again, that's just one 19 of the things that we consider in the overall 20 decision. 21 DANIEL COTTAR: Is Georgia more vocal 22 than the other places? 23 MR. JOHNSON: It's --24 DANIEL COTTAR: Because if that's the 25 case, perhaps those would be better places. 4| 4.2 5| 5.21| 5.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 9 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3764 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 43 1 In fact, Crawford, Georgia, would be a good 2 place. Crawford, Georgia. 3 Thank you. 4 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, sir. 5 Yes, ma'am. 6 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I believe I'm 7 correct. You said that the National 8 Veterinary Stockpile will transfer from Plum 9 Island to NBAF? It's currently housed at 10 Plum Island and it will transfer to the 11 replacement facility, correct? 12 MR. JOHNSON: Yes. 13 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: It says on that 14 website the National Veterinary Stockpile has 15 two primary goals. By 2011 it will acquire 16 countermeasures against the first ten of the 17 seventeen worst disease threats, including 18 highly pathogenic avian, Foot and Mouth 19 Disease, Rift Valley Fever, Exotic Newcastle, 20 Classical Swine Fever. By 2016 it will 21 acquire countermeasures against all seventeen 22 diseases. These diseases are also identified 23 as the agricultural bio -- and the bio -- 24 Agricultural Bioterrorism Act of 2002. 25 You keep listing these eight diseases. cont.| 5| 5.2 6| 23.2 7| 19.2cont.| 1| 5.2 1| 23.0 2| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 10 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, the National Veterinary Stockpile currently housed at PIADC on Plum Island, NY may be transfered to the replacement NBAF site. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern that all possible pathogens to be studied at the NBAF are not listed in the NBAF EIS. The pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS include Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study. If not, a new risk assessment would be prepared and a separate NEPA evaluation may be required.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3765 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 44 1 And I know the feasibility study also adds 2 highly pathogenic avian influenza and 3 Newcastle Disease. And I guess my question 4 is: If you're only evaluating three diseases 5 in the DEIS and I read that Plum Island has 6 as many as 40 diseases that will transfer, 7 I don't understand how this effectively 8 bounds the hazards, accidents and 9 consequences from Nipah. And I'd like for 10 you to explain how three diseases can take 11 care of all these other unknown diseases that 12 surely will be under one roof at NBAF.13 MR. PERGLER: We carried out the three 14 pathogens for detailed analysis. That's not 15 to say we ignored the other five. 16 We went through a very rigorous process 17 at the beginning of this analysis where we 18 actually had the multidisciplinary team, key 19 members of it, come to actually our offices 20 in Santa Fe and spent three days there 21 hashing out how best to perform the analysis. 22 There are considerations. You could have 23 done each and every one of them, but the time 24 and expense to do that would have been 25 enormous. cont.| 7| 19.2cont.| 2| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 11 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3766 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 45 1 We decided on the three pathogens because 2 in no case was one of the five -- in no case 3 does one of the five pathogens exceed the 4 consequence in any category of the three that 5 we selected. So when we carry out the three, 6 you're looking at the credible worst case 7 scenario that will not be exceeded by any 8 other organism. 9 And so that's what we used to determine 10 our bounding accidents case, if you will, and 11 the consequences thereof. 12 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I guess my point 13 is that you're talking about eight diseases, 14 I'm talking about more than forty. 15 DR. KAPPES: Yes. The reason why we -- 16 these eight are the diseases that we're 17 primarily going to be working with. For 18 research purposes those are the diseases that 19 we have prioritized -- we meaning USDA and 20 DHS. We've actually gone through having 21 several expert panels to prioritize what we 22 feel are the most dangerous pathogens for 23 agriculture. 24 The forty-plus pathogens, the remainder 25 of those are in stocks that USDA agents need 8| 19.2cont.| 2| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 12 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3767 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 46 1 for diagnostic purposes. If you're going to 2 rule out that one of these pathogens -- that 3 a tissue doesn't have one of these pathogens, 4 you need a positive control to make sure your 5 test is working. 6 So we'll only be doing very, very little 7 work on some of these other pathogens. And 8 the level of effort in that area doesn't 9 justify the same kind of analysis. 10 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I guess my point 11 is: Are they going to be under the NBAF 12 roof? And that's always been my point, is 13 that there will be more pathogens than the 14 eight you list. 15 Thank you.16 MS. COGHILL: As a point of process, 17 folks, we've got 10 minutes left in the 18 question and answers. So if you could just 19 be very clear with your questions so we could 20 accommodate the four folks that are left. 21 Thank you. 22 THOM JENKINS: Thom Jenkins, retired 23 DuPont. 24 I grew up in an industry that learned the 25 hard way that you don't put concentrated risk 9| 19.2 10| 19.2cont.| 2| 19.2 1| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 13 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS identifies DHS's mission as the study of foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. By definition, BSL-4 facilities are specifically designed to safely handle exotic pathogens that pose a high risk of life threatening disease in animals and humans through the aerosol route and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. It is because of the risks posed that NBAF in its current configuration is needed in order to provide a modern, integrated high-containment facility to safely and effectively address the accidental or intentional introduction into the U.S. of animal diseases of high consequence. A stand-alone BSL-4 lab would not enable DHS to fulfill its mission. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3768 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 47 1 under the same roof. It seems to me that 2 with 10 percent of the facility devoted to 3 Level 4 that one of the first choices should 4 be to build a small 50,000-square-foot Level 5 4 facility, maybe large animal connected with 6 it and scatter the other risks at other 7 sites. 8 And that seems not to have been addressed 9 in Mr. Teague's (phonetic spelling) 10 standpoint. I'd like to know why. 11 (Applause.)12 MR. JOHNSON: We looked at that. And the 13 whole idea is this would be an integrated 14 facility, you know, not just from a foreign 15 animal but a zoonotic disease. And we looked 16 at a number of things separating the research 17 from diagnostic. 18 What is unique about what we're doing is 19 foreign animal diseases. Plum Island is the 20 only facility that does it. It does has 21 research and diagnostics. So we feel like 22 adding the BSL-4 as part of the integration 23 will allow the scientists to do the 24 crossovers and the collaborations in a single 25 existing facility. cont.| 10| 19.2cont.| 1| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 14 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3769 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 48 1 MS. COGHILL: Thank you. 2 Yes, sir. 3 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I'd like to ask a 4 question about what I think is circular 5 reasoning in DEIS throughout as it's been 6 mentioned this evening. The conclusions 7 reached by the DEIS are based on normal 8 operations. 9 When you study the body of the DEIS, the 10 only way you can find what normal operations 11 means is by deducing that normal operations 12 are operations when nothing goes wrong. So, 13 therefore, when nothing goes wrong, nothing 14 goes wrong and you're able to conclude that 15 NBAF would have an insignificant impact on 16 health or safety. 17 I think that the DEIS should talk about 18 what are normal operations, what is the 19 likelihood that abnormal operations can occur 20 and is there a sliding scale of risk and 21 impact based on different scenarios of 22 abnormal operations. 23 MR. PERGLER: Okay. Under normal 24 operations -- what we're trying to do is full 25 disclosure. Normal operations doesn't mean 11| 19.2 12| 2.0 13| 19.21| 19.2 2| 2.0 cont.| 1| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 15 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's comment regarding the impact of normal operations. As stated in the EIS only under accident conditions is there the potential for adverse impacts. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Chapter 3, Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (APHIS). Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations as well as domestic and wildlife residing within the local area. DHS would have site- specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's comment regarding normal operations. Normal operations are described in Chapter 2 and abnormal or accident events are address in Chapter 3. As stated in the EIS only under accident conditions is there the potential for adverse impacts. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment.

We will also 5 disclose if that threatens to violate an air 6 quality standard, things like that. 7 So normal operations do have effects. So 8 we tell you what the operation is and tell 9 you what the effect is. 10 Now, we found effects under normal 11 operations to be within, for the most part, 12 the regulatory standards or did not have 13 adverse effects to, say, wildlife in the 14 area, things like that. 15 Now, we did also look at off-normal 16 events for the accident condition. And we 17 did give you the data there, too. We tell 18 you what the consequence is of a release. 19 For example, with Rift Valley Fever, if 20 the vector gets out, we could establish that 21 in this country. We disclose that 22 information. 23 Do we make a conclusion there? 24 Oftentimes unless there is a violation of a 25 federal statute/regulation/law, we will let August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 16 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3772 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 50 1 the data speak for itself. 2 So, again, we've given you that data in 3 there, that it is not without consequence and 4 significant consequence. We allow you to 5 determine what you think that effect is in 6 the scale. 7 As does DHS and USDA. They're going to 8 look at the facts. The decision makers will 9 make a determination does the benefit of the 10 construction and operation of the facility 11 exceed the potential risk. 12 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, the problem 13 is, of course, is in the summary. Many of 14 the decision makers, at least here in 15 Georgia, have read past the summary. And the 16 summary gives you a very optimistic look at 17 the picture. 18 So I wish when you go into the final EIS 19 you will consider how you deal with the 20 definition of normal operations. 21 MR. JOHNSON: Yeah. We're willing to do 22 that. 23 MS.

Within the context of performing environmental impact analyses, the term normal operations simply refers to those that are \"incident-free\" in contrast to \"abnormal\" operating conditions where a structure, system, or component does not function as designed or intended, by whatever the cause. Such operational or inherent design failures or unplanned events result in \"accidents\" or abnormal operating conditions, the consequences of which have been evaluated in Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. Nevertheless, impacts would occur from construction and operation of the NBAF under normal operations such that resources would be consumed and effluents would be routinely emitted to the air and water within specified permit limits, etc. These effects are also assessed in resource-specific sections of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3773 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 51 1 I live here in Clarke County. 2 My question has to do with water. And I 3 have not had a chance to look at the entire 4 draft document yet. But I'd like to know: 5 In the analyses did you actually look at 6 where the water was going to come from? 7 I understand it will be the equivalent of 8 228 households' use of water. And, 9 specifically, did you address where that 10 water is going to come from in Clarke County, 11 where we've had increasingly severe droughts 12 with very tight water restrictions on the 13 citizens? 14 And my understanding is that whatever the 15 water use is at this facility they will not 16 be able to further decrease use under drought 17 conditions. 18 So that's my question, what did you look 19 into about the sources of water in the 20 various sites and specifically what about 21 here. 22 MR. PERGLER: Yeah. Basically you'll 23 find the answer in the infrastructure section 24 of the EIS where again we look at capacities, 25 safe water yield of that. So we looked at 15| 12.21| 12.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 18 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3774 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 52 1 the water supply and looked at what the 2 capacity is and determined that if -- with 3 the projected water use from NBAF do we stay 4 within the safe yield capacity. And the 5 answer is yes in this case. 6 Now, under drought conditions, that's 7 going to have to be determined what the 8 action of DHS is based on community needs and 9 the plans in effect at that time. And that 10 will be determined when the site selection 11 process is made. 12 MR. JOHNSON: We'll determine what's the 13 mitigation action that we need to take. It's 14 important that we know that, and a decision 15 maker would know what we'd be doing in that 16 particular -- 17 SUSAN HODGES: Don't you have to know 18 that when you're looking at the sites now? 19 MR. JOHNSON: That's -- 20 SUSAN HODGES: If we don't have water 21 here, how come this is still a site? 22 (Applause.)23 MS. COGHILL: Sir. 24 JOHN WILKINSON: Hello.

I'm not sure -- if we 3 might want a desert site, in my opinion. 4 But my question is: In your rigorous 5 analysis of the accidental release of 6 contaminants did you consider land, air and 7 water modes of new transmission such as with 8 land you have rooming animals such as deer 9 all over the place, research animals with 10 UGA, private cattle, pets, dogs and cats of 11 people in town and even humans. 12 And as far as air as the mode of 13 transmission, we have the most hot and humid 14 site on the list with the highest levels of 15 water vapor, also the highest level, 16 according to entomologists, of winged inspect 17 predators spreading diseases as they do with 18 plant pathogens. 19 And then water transmission. There is a 20 pond on a tributary to the Middle Oconee 21 River right next to the property boundary, 22 according to this map I've seen with the 23 river itself approximately 1500 feet south of 24 the site. 25 So when I look at all these modes of 16| 4.2 17| 13.2| 21.2 18| 25.22| 4.0 3| 25.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 20 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns about DHS's toll-free fax number and the date by which comments on the NBAF Draft EIS had to be received in order to be considered by DHS. DHS is not aware of any misprints of the toll-free fax number in its public outreach literature but does regret any inconvience or miscommunication of information in this regard during the public meetings. DHS did receive approximately 100 comments documents via fax. The 60-day public comment period on the NBAF Draft EIS ended on August 25, and DHS considered and has responded to in this Comment Response Document all comment documents postmarked on or before August 25, 2008.

And there was an 4 editorial in one of our local publications 5 today which I think hit this issue on the 6 head, that most scientists at this site are 7 likely -- I think it's not unrealistic to 8 assume most of them will choose to live in 9 suburban Oconee County and yet the 10 infrastructure needs will be in Clarke 11 County. 12 And Clarke County is very small. It's 13 the smallest county in the state and one of 14 the poorest, which is a surprise -- it was a 15 surprise to me to learn. So I think it 16 places an undue burden on our taxes here, us 17 as taxpayers here in Clarke county. 18 And I wonder if you addressed that or if 19 you just looked at sort of the regional 20 aspect of tax revenues and infrastructure. 21 MR. PERGLER: The methodology that we 22 used for the socioeconomics impact is we 23 assumed that all -- we used 326 employees for 24 the NBAF facility. For the purposes of this 25 analysis we assumed them all to come from out 19| 15.22| 15.21| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 22 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Funding for the design, construction, and operations for the NBAF will come from the Federal Government. Proposals for offsets to the site infrastructure (part of thr construction costs) were requested by the Federal government. The decision as to what to offer (land donation, funding, other assets) is solely at the discretion of the consortium, state and local officials as part of the consortium bid site package. The amount of funding and how the funding is paid for (bonds, taxes, etc) is determined by the state and local government officials and not the decision of the Federal government.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3778 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 56 1 of state. That gives the greatest burden to 2 the infrastructure in the counties of -- in 3 the region of influence that we looked at. 4 We did not find that the infrastructure 5 would be overly burdened by those individuals 6 coming in. This was the most conservative 7 method we could -- we could use to make sure 8 that the capacity exists or if it didn't 9 exist we could develop mitigation. But, 10 again, we found the existent fire, police, 11 just housing and that sort of thing. 12 Bradley, would you like to add anything 13 to that? 14 BRADLEY: The -- I just want to -- 15 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Stand up, please. 16 MR. PERGLER: They want you to stand 17 up. 18 BRADLEY: Yes. I just want to reiterate 19 what Chuck said. 20 For the impacts on community facilities 21 we did use the largest number to look at what 22 the impact would be on the community, on the 23 housing, the schools and fire and all the 24 community facilities. So we looked at 326 25 employees coming into the area, which would August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 23 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3779 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 57 1 give you -- we also looked at journey to work 2 information, applied the number. 3 So it's actually not 326. It's actually 4 a little less than that because some may not 5 be living in the three-county region that we 6 looked at. But this gave us the largest 7 parameters to look at the impact on community 8 facilities. And we found no significant 9 impact on these. 10 UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: That seems 11 unbelievable to me. But given the fact that 12 Clarke County is so small and the facility 13 located in Clarke County and right next to 14 the Oconee County line, I just find that 15 unbelievable. 16 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, sir. 17 (Applause.) 18 MS. COGHILL: This is the formal comment 19 portion of the agenda. I'd like to go over 20 the parameters that we have set forth, ask 21 that you all follow them. 22 They're the same parameters that we've 23 put in place at all the sites to respect all 24 community members at each location. And we 25 expect that everybody here respects those 20| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 24 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3780 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 58 1 people who have the floor, regardless of 2 their opinion that they get an opportunity to 3 speak. 4 Having said that, I will guide each 5 person through where they are on the clock. 6 But, like I said before, each speaker has 7 three minutes. 8 We do have a full agenda of speakers this 9 evening. We want to make sure everyone gets 10 a chance to speak. 11 Each person has, again, three minutes. 12 At two minutes, thirty seconds I will hold up 13 the yellow card and at three minutes when 14 your time is up the red. If you have not 15 finished your comments, please turn and 16 quietly go back to your seats, because we 17 have over forty people here who would like to 18 speak this evening. 19 The first person, it will be Cecilia 20 Herles. 21 I'm also going to call the next few folks 22 after her.

It's hard when the mighty Goliath of 6 profit stands before those of us who are 7 opposed to NBAF. 8 I am strongly opposed to NBAF here in 9 Athens. And, frankly, I'm dismayed but not 10 surprised at how the many vocal opponents of 11 NBAF here in Athens have been portrayed as 12 lacking the proper information or has some -- 13 or, you know, been seen as somehow 14 irrational. 15 As someone who is very proud of my Ph.D. 16 from UGA, my research is focused on 17 environmental ethics. And I find that this 18 is, unfortunately, the typical kind of 19 bashing of those who dare to voice concerns 20 regarding the environment. 21 We who oppose NBAF -- 22 (Applause.)23 CECILIA HERLES: -- are a large and 24 diverse group of concerned residents, 25 including local business owners, parents, 21| 25.2 cont.| 21| 25.21| 25.2 cont.| 1| 25.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 26 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3782 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 60 1 teachers, UGA students, faculty and staff. 2 We who oppose NBAF, like myself, prefer the 3 philosophy of caution, hindsight and risk 4 assessment. We who oppose NBAF prefer the 5 philosophy of quality of life. 6 To us NBAF represents destruction, not 7 protection. To us NBAF represents a loss of 8 a beautiful, aesthetic value of land to 9 replace -- to be replaced by this facility of 10 the size of five Walmarts. 11 I don't understand how it can be said in 12 good conscience that this is a, quote, 13 unquote, green facility. At one of the last 14 Department of Homeland Security meetings this 15 was actually a claim that was made. I think 16 this is the most outrageous statement I have 17 heard so far in all of this. 18 I teach classes here at UGA on the 19 environment. Believe me, I think this is a 20 gross misuse of the word. 21 When something is, quote, unquote, 22 green -- and that word is thrown around a 23 lot -- it does not endanger the surrounding 24 ecosystem, it does not place unnecessary 25 burdens on resources such as water that are 22| 25.2 23| 7.2cont.| 1| 25.2 2| 7.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 27 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 7.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the visual effects of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site, which are described in Section 3.2.3 of the NBAF EIS. DHS recognizes that the NBAF would be a distinctive visible feature and would alter the viewshed of the area. The NBAF would be designed and constructed to emphasize state-of-the-art strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, material selection, and indoor environmental quality. In addition, Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS discusses proposed mitigation measures for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF including measures consistent with the low-impact design (LID) approach.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3783 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 61 1 in trouble already in terms of meeting the 2 needs of the community. And it certainly 3 does not pose serious and potentially 4 irrevocable threats to air, water and life. 5 Ideally if something is green it means it 6 adds to the flourishing, not the flushing of 7 one's resources. 8 In all of this I'm reminded of the word 9 spraypainted on the levy walls in New 10 Orleans: hindsight. I have been a local 11 resident for over ten years and I've been 12 fortunate enough to make Oconee County my 13 home, along with other family members, and 14 I've even convinced family members to move 15 down here. Up until now it's been a very 16 easy sell. 17 It's a beautiful place. I'm proud to 18 live here. I'm the mother of two young 19 children. And, like so many others, we love 20 the botanical gardens, the beautiful scenery 21 and the best views of Athens in town when we 22 go by Milledge and Whitehall. 23 I'm not opposed to something else going 24 there necessarily, just NBAF.

As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes.. The South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would have access to rhree surface water resources: the North Oconee River, the Middle Oconee River, and the Jackson County Bear Creek Reservoir. The access to three surface water resources would help ensure the availability of water in the event that any one of those sources becomes inadequate. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Construction of a fence and security road would have minor effects, and there would be temporary effects due to increased noise and lighting during construction activities. Operation of the NBAF would result in minimal noise emissions due to heating and cooling systems as well as occasional testing and operation of emergency generators. Nighttime lighting would be designed as to minimize the potential effects.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3784 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 62 1 suffering animal test subjects and possibly 2 armed guards keeps me awake at night. 3 Thank you. 4 (Applause.)5 MS.

We accept while there may be 3 minimal risk associated with this facility 4 these are far outweighed by the much greater 5 benefits not only to Athens but to the larger 6 community to which we all belong. It is a 7 point on which I would like to expand. 8 Let me begin by starting on a strong 9 belief that it's the obligation and duty of 10 the university to apply its resources to the 11 service of the people of the state. And so 12 while attempting to say that diseases that 13 will be studied by NBAF are diseases that 14 are not here today in Athens, Georgia, 15 because they are foreign animal diseases and 16 emerging infectious diseases, we must be 17 honest and acknowledge the irrefutable fact 18 that Athens and Georgia are part of the 19 global community. 20 Today travel and interaction between the 21 continents, the exchange of people, animals, 22 animal products and food products are vastly 23 greater than in the past. But, too, is also 24 the potential for the microbes and diseases 25 that accompany them. cont.| 30| 24.2cont.| 1| 24.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 33 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3789 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 67 1 Who among us have not been -- or had 2 second thoughts about the tomatoes or the 3 peppers that we buy often from international 4 countries?

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. As described in Chapter 3 and summarized in Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS, the impacts of activities during normal operations at any of the six site alternatives would likely be minor. Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 (Health and Safety), and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS, provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, addresses accident scenarios, including external events such as a terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only)(TRA) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The TRA is \"For Official Use Only\" and is not available for public review. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high-consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process. Security would be provided by a series of fencing, security cameras, and protocols. In addition, a dedicated security force would be present on-site. Additional security could be provided via cooperation with local law enforcement agencies.

I have a prepared 2 statement I'd like to read to you tonight. 3 I believe the National Bio -- National 4 Bio and Agro-Defense Facility has become one 5 of the most important opportunities that 6 Athens-Clarke County has seen in the 7 generation. Although the decision to locate 8 this facility here will ultimately rest with 9 federal officials, local government may 10 nonetheless play a vital role in the success 11 of these efforts. 12 Other things being equal, the federal 13 government officials in charge of deciding on 14 the location of these facilities are less 15 likely to choose to locate in a community 16 where they believe a facility will be 17 unwelcome by the citizens. For this reason 18 it is important that local government 19 officials who have been elected to represent 20 local citizens such as myself make their 21 views known about the NBAF. 22 Virtually everyone recognizes that we 23 need to attract industry that brings 24 high-paying jobs. Athens-Clarke County is 25 one of the poorest counties in the country 46| 24.2 47| 5.2 48| 15.21| 24.2 2| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 41 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. The economic and quality of life effects of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site are included in Section 3.10.3 of the NBAF EIS. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3797 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 75 1 with a population of over one hundred 2 thousand. Every issue that has a potential 3 to effect economic development and financial 4 opportunities for our citizens, especially 5 the poorest among us, is paramount in 6 considering any issue, including the NBAF 7 proposal. 8 I would like to emphasize those on the 9 lowest end of the economic ladder because I 10 agree with Franklin Roosevelt when he said in 11 his second inaugural address the test of our 12 progress is not whether we add more to the 13 abundance of those who have much; it is 14 whether we provide enough for those who have 15 too little. The only issue more important 16 than raising the standard of living for our 17 citizens is protecting the safety of all 18 residents who are also our families, our 19 friends and our neighbors. 20 If I believed that any economic 21 development proposal would harm the people or 22 resources of our region, I would leave the 23 opposition to that proposal.

I will never defend 10 many, if not most, of the actions of our 11 current federal administration. However, we 12 must not let our disgust and anger with the 13 administration in Washington blind us to a 14 genuinely safe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity 15 to bring in great jobs and not just a few 16 great jobs but jobs that could number in the 17 thousands. 18 I understand some people are fearful of 19 the proposed NBAF facility. And if I 20 believed everything that has been said by the 21 minority who are opposed to all such 22 facilities, I, too, would oppose the NBAF. 23 If I believed in every false rumor, if I 24 believed in the orchestrated campaign of 25 misinformation about the dangers of the cont.| 48| 15.2 49| 24.2cont.| 2| 15.2 cont.| 1| 24.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 43 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3799 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 77 1 facility, I would be a leader in a fight to 2 stop in NBAF research proposal. 3 However, let me say here to all of you 4 tonight that I do not believe these false 5 rumors -- (inaudible). 6 MS.

I am 4 convinced that when we are compared against 5 the other sites with our proximity to CDC, to 6 Emory and especially to the University of 7 Georgia, along with our numerous other 8 attributes, that Athens will be selected. 9 Thank you very much. 10 MS.

DHS and USDA would ensure that the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site will comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes commentor's recommendation to design the NBAF facilities at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The NBAF would be designed and constructed to emphasize state-of-the-art strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, material selection, and indoor environmental quality. In addition, Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS discusses proposed mitigation measures for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF including measures consistent with the low-impact design (LID) approach.

And I'm very comfortable 2 having this facility in Athens after all of 3 that work that I have done. 4 We enjoy the ability to eat food that is 5 safe, thanks to government scientists who 6 work and have worked in similar facilities 7 for over half of a century. And in order for 8 us to continue enjoying a safe and secure 9 food supply this kind of research is 10 necessary and it must be ongoing. We need 11 labs with the needed capacity to do this kind 12 of work. So I would like to believe that 13 Athens is the best location to replace an 14 aging facility given our location to 15 complementary assets within our region. 16 I do want to note that the EIS talks 17 extensively about various local and 18 environmental regulations that I'm familiar 19 with, in addition to those imposed by 20 the State and federal government. So I 21 appreciate that you took the time to look at 22 our local regulations.

I'll be good. 17 I'm here to tell you you've been misled 18 by the consortium on one of the criteria for 19 selecting a site for NBAF. There was and 20 continues to be no demonstrated community 21 acceptance of this project. 22 The January 16th, 2006, Federal Register 23 states in DHS's call for expressions of 24 interest, quote, DHS will evaluate each EOI 25 submission using four site criteria cont.| 63| 8.2 1| 25.2 2| 4.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 53 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of Federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], and Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF and the No Action Alternative. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes commentor's recommendation to design the NBAF facilities at the Umstead Research Farm site to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The NBAF would be designed and constructed to emphasize state-of-the-art strategies for sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, material selection, and indoor environmental quality. In addition, Section 3.15 of the NBAF EIS discusses proposed mitigation measures for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF including measures consistent with the low-impact design (LID) approach.

Reportedly, Georgia 9 also has an appropriate local work force and 10 broad-based community support to guarantee 11 the success of NBAF. 12 Also, in the heading under community 13 acceptance we read Georgia Wants NBAF. 14 Georgia officials, from senators and the 15 governor on down, wrote letters of support to 16 DHS Director Michael Chertoff as part of the 17 EOI. Our elected officials in March 2006 all 18 used the word we in their supportive welcome. 19 Athens Mayor Heidi Davison wrote we stand 20 ready to accept this facility and are 21 prepared to assist in any way we can. 22 Well, in March 2006 Athens, Georgia, not 23 only didn't want NBAF, we had no idea what 24 the hell NBAF was.

Despite lack of community 5 knowledge or acceptance when DHS came to 6 inspect the site six months later, on April 7 24th, 2007, Mayor Davison told DHS that UGA 8 leaders have done a good job keeping people 9 informed about the proposal and because 10 Athens has a very educated and engaged 11 citizenry the public has kept a close eye on 12 the proposal and what it would mean for the 13 community. 14 The same ABH article quotes Homeland 15 Security spokesman Chris Kelly as saying 16 that, quote, UGA leaders must incorporate 17 feedback from residents within a 60-mile 18 radius of the site and show they have either 19 received community input or have a specific 20 plan to draw feedback from area residents. 21 But when asked UGA's David Mead about this in 22 email exchange and at a meeting he called 23 this misinformation. 24 Jeff Wilson, publisher of the Athens 25 Banner Herald, is on the board of the August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 55 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3811 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 89 1 Athens-Clarke County Economic Development 2 Foundation, which itself is a member of the 3 Georgia Consortium: With news headlines like 4 UGA chief likes bio-defense chances, senators 5 hoping Georgia assets will win fed labs and 6 editorials titled defense facility seems 7 natural fit for university and bio-technology 8 dreams could become reality, newspaper 9 publishing could best be described as 10 cheerleading. 11 Anyone seeking facts about potential 12 risks of such a lab have to look to press of 13 other states where the newspapers reported 14 the down side of NBAF and the communities 15 turned against it. 16 And the show goes own with the discovery 17 yesterday of a captured terrorist possessing 18 maps of Plum Island the headline this morning 19 might be NBAF a possible terrorist target. 20 Instead the Banner Herald reads NBAF Salaries 21 on Top of Local Scale. 22 But make no mistake.

And my children go to 10 school about five miles from the planned 11 facility at Athens Montessori. 12 I own a local web development firm here 13 in Athens and I employ ten people here, ten 14 people that need these jobs. In the spirit 15 of full disclosure, I'm also a board member 16 on the Athens Economic Development Foundation 17 board. 18 I've come here tonight to speak about the 19 special interests that are being served by 20 the support of this project. We do not 21 support this project because we're 22 pro-government or pro-military or 23 anti-environment. We are simply pro-business 24 and want to see Athens take full benefit of 25 the knowledge that's being developed at our 67| 24.21| 24.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 57 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3813 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 91 1 university systems. 2 This opportunity came to us because of 3 our scientific community and our economic 4 development leaders and because of our 5 special -- and because of the special 6 interest this community has. We have a 7 special interest in more jobs for the Athens 8 area. 9 Many of the opponents have argued that 10 the highest-paying jobs will be given to 11 transplants while Athenians will be left with 12 the lower-paying jobs. The truth is that 13 people will live in and among us, they will 14 spend their money at local businesses, they 15 will buy real estate in our area and 16 contribute to the tax base in our area. 17 Over time these positions will inevitably 18 transition to more locally learned 19 professionals. 20 Even if only fifty jobs go to Athenians 21 at an average salary of thirty to fifty K a 22 year with federal benefits, that's a great 23 benefit to those fifty people who might work, 24 are in underpaid positions or be unemployed. 25 And who are we to turn those jobs away. cont.| 67| 24.2 68| 15.2cont.| 1| 24.2 2| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 58 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement regarding employment. In addition to creating temporary construction jobs, the proposed action is expected to directly and indirectly support permanent jobs. A portion of the permanent jobs at the NBAF will be filled locally and the household spending by new residents and the operations of the NBAF are expected to indirectly support additional jobs that will be filled by the local labor force. The number of short-term and permanent jobs that will be directly and indirectly created by the construction and operations of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative are discussed in Section 3.10 of the NBAF EIS. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3814 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 92 1 We have a special interest in building an 2 economic base that will help fund the 3 creation of new business and more jobs in 4 existing businesses. We have a special 5 interest in expanding our scientific 6 knowledge and our ability to attract 7 businesses that will enable us to keep more 8 of the graduates from all the post-secondary 9 institutions we are fortunate to have in 10 Athens. 11 Whether NBAF is built here or not, our 12 primarily special interest should be in 13 making sure that Athens isn't overlooked as a 14 possible location for other business and 15 industry, because we need the jobs and we 16 need the income. When a potential business 17 contacts the Georgia Department of Economic 18 Development looking for a suitable location, 19 we don't want Athens to be at the bottom of 20 the list because economic development is a 21 dirty word here. 22 During my tenure on the Economic 23 Development Foundation board these are the 24 only special interests I have been introduced 25 to.

And I think that's 19 been reviewed in detail. 20 One thing to me that's clear is that 21 foreign animal diseases eventually will get 22 here.

Again, it's spelled 6 out, it's close to CDC, close to the College 7 of Veterinary Medicine, close to UGA and on 8 and on. 9 I think if you're looking for zero risk 10 in something like this, forget it. There's 11 always a risk. I think the bigger risk, 12 though, is not protecting our country by 13 developing the means of diagnosing these 14 diseases early, by preventing them, by 15 containing them is bigger than that, a lot 16 bigger than that. 17 So that's -- I support bringing it here. 18 Thank you. 19 MS.

And we should know they do in 72| 25.2 73| 19.21| 25.2 2| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 62 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A description of the potential for a pathogen or infected vector to spread with an accidental release is included in Section 3.14. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations was evaluated in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the NBAF. RVF and foot and mouth disease SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. The potential consequences of pesticide use would be evaluated during the preparation of a site- specific response plan. Additional effects of a pathogen release to wildlife is included in Section 3.8.9 and the potential economic effects are included in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3818 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 96 1 foreign agriculture. 2 We have the highest insect population 3 pressures of all the sites or anywhere in the 4 U.S. Mosquitoes are an admitted vector of 5 transmission and all over Athens of one of 6 the diseases, the Rift Valley fever. 7 Also, we have the case of a liquid 8 aqueous transmission of contaminants. The 9 Athens site is precariously close to the 10 Middle Oconee River enabling transmission via 11 water medium going downstream to the southern 12 coastal plains where we have an agricultural 13 sector. In the Piedmont we have a lot of 14 cattle. 15 The watershed has ample site for mosquito 16 breeding which might lead to the spread of 17 pathogens. There's a pond on a tributary 18 bordering the property for this site that 19 goes to the Middle Oconee River which is 20 approximately 1500 feet from the border of 21 the site. 22 If we consider the land transmission of 23 contaminants and inadvertent release, we have 24 land animals and the associated solids. Deer 25 run all over the place. They are roaming cont.| 73| 19.2 74| 12.2 cont.| 2| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 63 of 132 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's regional watershed concerns. The NBAF EIS Section 3.7.3 describes the water resources at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative and the potential construction and operational consequences. Section 3.14 describes the hazard and accident analysis including site- specific consequences.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3819 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 97 1 animals like those who get Foot and Mouth 2 Disease. We got cattle, rodents, dogs and 3 pets and people. People can get the Hendra 4 virus. 5 Pets and rodents are noted vectors of 6 some diseases to be studied, including the 7 Nipah Virus. Roamers like the deer and 8 research sheep, cattle and horses, as well as 9 private cattle and horses, can spread the 10 Foot and Mouth Disease. 11 So it seems that, you know, the Athens 12 site has the highest risk. It seems as -- 13 almost as if the people who suggest the 14 Georgia, North Carolina, Mississippi sites 15 may be out of touch with the agricultural and 16 biological realities in the Southeast like 17 the humid Southeast and the potential hazards 18 associated with release of contaminants. 19 (Applause.)20 MS.

The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF then site-specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the NBAF. Section 3.8.9 of the NBAF EIS addresses existing and potentially applicable response plans that provide insight into some of the livestock and wildlife protective and mitigating measures that could be employed in the event of a pathogen release from the NBAF. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative and concern regarding the potential consequences from a NBAF accident. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3820 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 98 1 Jackson County neighbor and cattle producer. 2 I want to thank the Department of 3 Homeland Security, U.S. Department of 4 Agriculture for this opportunity to comment 5 on NBAF and its Draft Environmental Impact 6 Statement. 7 I know of no greater service that can be 8 rendered to any country than the improvement 9 of its agriculture. These words were spoken 10 over 200 years ago by our nation's first 11 president, George Washington. And they 12 remain true today. 13 But tonight I choose to strengthen this 14 quote to include the protection of 15 agriculture and the protection of the quality 16 of life for all of our citizens. The 17 citizens of our nation is so important. 18 Such, I believe, is the purpose of NBAF. 19 For over forty years my organization has 20 represented and promoted Georgia's 55 billion 21 dollar agriculture industry. And that 22 includes the interest of cattle, sheep, swine 23 and poultry producers throughout the state. 24 We have over 750 member farms and 25 companies in this state for whom a strong 79| 1.0 80| 24.21| 1.0 2| 24.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 65 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for the proposed research that would be conducted within the NBAF.

Importantly, 3 an implicit part of our mission is ensuring 4 the quality of life for all of our citizens. 5 My organization believes that NBAF would be 6 an asset to Georgia and that Georgia is the 7 best possible place to locate this important 8 facility. 9 We've heard much about the foreign animal 10 diseases that NBAF will study, including Foot 11 and Mouth Disease and the very real potential 12 to disrupt the food supply and devastate the 13 economy of our state and our country. What 14 we need to understand is it is our vigilance, 15 our ongoing investment in animal health 16 research that protects our agriculture. 17 In a world where global trade is 18 increasing, we cannot let our guard down. If 19 we, in fact -- if we ignore this fact, it's 20 at our peril. 21 We have a complete confidence that NBAF 22 can and will conduct research on foot and -- 23 Foot and Mouth Disease and other diseases 24 safely.

We 8 represent the people of our community whose 9 consent has never been sought and whose 10 consent never will be given to the proposed 11 NBAF being developed in the midst of our 12 pleasant, peaceful and progressive town. 13 Do not mistake politeness or even natural 14 congeniality of our people for a passivity or 15 absence of resolve. Our purpose is to 16 prevent NBAF from being located in our 17 community. Our purpose is to inform people 18 of the truth obscured by proponents, 19 propaganda and to expose the conflicted 20 interest and perverse logic of those who 21 would seek to degrade our environment and 22 place our population and much of our economy 23 at risk for the convenience, perceived 24 prestige and financial gain of a few. 25 In our opposition to NBAF in Athens we 85| 25.21| 25.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 68 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3824 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 102 1 will not back down nor will we step aside. 2 To bring NBAF to Athens DHS will have to 3 climb a mountain of legal briefs and live 4 with a lifetime of negative reaction and 5 public resentment. 6 NBAF is not compatible with the 7 recreational nature and character of the land 8 on South Milledge.

DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A multi-disciplinary team of engineers, scientists, lawyers, academics and communicators from the departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Defense reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. A change in land use would occur; however, current zoning regulations allow for this type of development. The South Milledge Avenue Site is currently zoned as \"Governmental\", and construction and operation of the NBAF is consistent with this designation. However, the Clarke County Comprehensive Plan designates the South Milledge Avenue Site as \"rural\", so an amendment to the comprehensive plan may be required. This information has been added to the NBAF EIS in Section 3.2.3. DHS and USDA ensure that the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site will comply with all applicable local, state, and Federal regulations and policies. The visual effects of the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site are also described in Section 3.2.3 of the NBAF EIS. DHS recognizes that the NBAF would be a distinctive visible feature and would alter the viewshed of the area. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.2 See response to Comment No. 2. DHS notes the commentor's preference for the Plum Island Site Alternative.

Plum Island is an 7 800-acre site already owned by DHS that has 8 been used for dangerous pathogen 9 experimentation for over fifty years.

Information on the human symptoms of zoonotic pathogen exposure to humans for Rift Valley Fever Virus, Nipah Virus, Hendra Virus, and Japanese Encephalitis Virus is provided in Chapter 3, Section 3.14.1 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's mission is to study foreign animal, zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and emerging diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The NBAF would enable research on the transmission of these animal diseases and support development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies for foreign animal, zoonotic and emerging diseases. By proposing to construct the NBAF, DHS is following policy direction established by the Congress and the President.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3827 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 105 1 high-consequence biological threats involving 2 foreign animal, zoonotic and human diseases. 3 House Bill 1717 that has been overrode 4 by -- -ridden by the Farm Bill said the 5 purpose of NBAF shall be an integrated human, 6 foreign animal and zoonotic disease research 7 development testing evaluation facility with 8 complementary missions from DHS, Department 9 of Agriculture, Department of Health and 10 Human Services. 11 From DHS website, the second downselect 12 last July: The NBAF, when built, we're going 13 to enhance our nation's defense against 14 animal and plant disease threats, said Jay 15 Cohen, Undersecretary of Science and 16 Technology, unquote.

NBAF 3 doesn't address that at all. 4 I just read a book called The Plowman's 5 Folly, written in the 1930s, that gave 6 exhaustive research that plowing is the 7 fundamental problem with soil preservation 8 because we rob the soil's ability to 9 replenish itself with the decaying vegetable 10 matter.

The NBAF would have the levels of protection and control required by applicable DHS security directives.

If the impact that CDC has had on 18 the surrounding Decatur neighborhood is any 19 indication of what the impact might be on my 20 back yard, my back yard's going to get more 21 valuable. 22 I recognize that some of the people in 23 the community have concerns about this 24 facility. As a resident of Athens, I am much 25 more concerned about some of the risks 106| 4.2 107| 15.2 108| 1.21| 4.2 2| 15.2 3| 1.0 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 85 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the basic conclusions of the NBAF EIS. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. A discussion of the effects of the NBAF on property values was included in Section 3.10, which concluded that there would be no expected adverse effect for any of the sites. It is possible that with the relocation of highly skilled workers to the immediate area, property values could increase due to an increase in demand, and there is no empirical evidence that a facility such as the NBAF would reduce property values in the study area. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for NBAF. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low for all sites. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3841 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 119 1 associated with very simple, everyday acts 2 like driving around town than I am about the 3 operation and siting of this facility. Of 4 much greater concern to me, as a scientist, 5 is the consequence of not building NBAF, 6 regardless of where it may happen to be, at 7 Athens or another site. 8 I travel a lot professionally. As an 9 oceanographer I go to many places in the 10 world, various research projects. And as a 11 microbiologist I realize how hard it is to 12 keep microbes and their vectors, the kinds 13 that will be worked on at the NBAF facility, 14 out of the country. 15 It's not a matter -- as other people have 16 said, it's not a matter of if we keep them 17 out of the country, it is simply a matter of 18 when they will be here. Whether they are 19 introduced by accident, for example, as a 20 traveler bringing back a keepsake, whether 21 it's an undeclared shell or tortoise or 22 something like that or a shipment of imported 23 projects -- products or intentionally by 24 someone seeking to do us harm, they will get 25 here.

Welcome to 13 Georgia. 14 I'm Stephen Meeks. I'm representing both 15 of Georgia's US senators, Johnny Isakson and 16 Saxby Chambliss. And I have a brief 17 statement to make, that we commend the 18 Department of Homeland Security for 19 continuing the public outreach for the NBAF 20 final sites. These forums have provided the 21 opportunity for the community and the public 22 to participate in a process to ensure that 23 all opinions and views are heard. 24 Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny 25 Isakson believe that this project is critical cont.| 109| 24.2 1| 4.2 2| 5.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 87 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement.

The state of 4 Georgia already plays a critical role in the 5 field of animal research right here in 6 Athens, as well as infectious diseases at the 7 Center of Disease Control in Atlanta. Given 8 our experience in these areas of critical 9 importance, Georgia is honored to be a 10 finalist in the NBAF site; and we are 11 confident the DHS will find the City of 12 Athens to be a gracious host and an effective 13 partner. 14 In addition, Athens is an attractive 15 location that will -- that will secure 16 necessary private industry support and 17 scientific expertise to fulfill the mission 18 of NBAF. The state of Georgia and the Athens 19 community stand ready to serve side by side 20 with our Department of Homeland Security. 21 Thank you. 22 MS. COGHILL: Thank you. 23 (Applause.)24 MS.

We feel 8 like it's an environmentally sensitive area 9 and it's not appropriate for such a large 10 high-risk facility. 11 I'd like to make three comments 12 specifically on the EIS. First of all, we 13 feel like erosion and sedimentation is not 14 adequately addressed. We feel that's -- 15 there will be substantial disturbance during 16 construction. We think a more rigorous 17 analysis such as environmental simulation 18 modeling is needed to quantify these effects 19 on the river. 20 We also ask that stream restoration be 21 considered to maintain the current quality in 22 the river and that the cost of restoration, 23 which can range from one hundred to two 24 hundred dollars per foot, be considered in a 25 cost benefit analysis of the site. 114| 25.2 115| 12.21| 25.2 2| 12.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 89 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative based on risks to the river. The NBAF would be designed and constructed using modern biocontainment technologies, and operated by trained staff and security personnel to ensure the maximum level of worker and public safety and least risk to the environment in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's opinions. The NBAF EIS Section 3.7.3 describes the water resources at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative including potential construction and operational consequences. A detailed geotechnical report will be prepared as part of the final design and following the proposed NBAF final site selection. During the NBAF final design, avoidance, minimization and mitigation will be further considered in efforts to address potential stream side impacts. Section 3.3.3.4 describes the Middle Oconee WWTP's sewage acceptance criteria that the NBAF would have to meet. DHS acknowledges the regional drought conditions. DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and DHS acknowledges the drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1, the NBAF at the South Milledge Avenue Site would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water approximately 0.76% of Athens 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to 228 residential home's annual potable water usage. Section 3.7.3.1.1 describes the potential potable water sources, the Middle and North Oconee Rivers and the Jackson County Bear Creek Reservoir. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3845 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 123 1 Second, we ask that the risk of the 2 increased discharge of treated waste to our 3 rivers be considered in the EIS to ensure 4 that the standards and criteria are not 5 exceeded. 6 The treated waste can reduce oxygen in 7 streams and kills fish. This happened twice 8 last year, two fish kills last year due to 9 lack of water for dilution. And so we would 10 like this specifically addressed in the EIS 11 quantitatively. 12 Third, we feel like there's not enough 13 water to support this facility. On Page 3-35 14 there's two alternatives. The first one it 15 looks like will not meet peak flow 16 requirements, and the second one is not 17 recommended by ACC. So it seems to us that 18 there is really no workable solution. 19 We ask that the EIS include a 20 quantitative and comprehensive analysis of 21 water withdrawal within the context of all 22 the competing water uses and demands and the 23 future estimates of water resources for this 24 basin. 25 Also, scientific literature recognizes cont.| 115| 12.2 116| 13.2cont.| 2| 12.2 3| 13.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 90 of 132 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 13.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential effects on aquatic species and water quality at the South Milledge Avenue Site. As described in Section 3.15, best management practices and requirements for a stormwater pollution prevention plan would mitigate potential erosion and sedimentation impacts during the construction process, and low impact design (LID) features would be used to minimize the potential for adverse impacts associated with stormwater runoff from the completed facility. Preliminary LID measures that are being considered include pervious pavement in both parking lots and pedestrian walkways, capturing and using roof runoff for landscape watering, and grading parking lots to filter storm water through landscaped areas. As described in Section 3.3.3.1.4, sewage acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements would apply to the wastewater discharged from the proposed NBAF. The Athens-Clarke County Sewer Use Ordinance of 2007 provides limits on specific pollutant discharges to the Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility. The NBAF would be designed and operated as necessary to comply with Athens-Clarke County Middle Oconee Wastewater Treatment Facility criteria and avoid the discharge of potentially harmful wastewater constituents. Implementation of approved erosion control measures, utilization of LID storm water pollution prevention measures, and compliance with wastewater treatment standards would prevent significant impacts on downstream aquatic resources such as the Middle Oconee River. By minimizing stormwater runoff, LID techniques would minimize the potential for adverse effects on flow regime.

And we ask 3 that the EIS specifically address the effect 4 on the greater than one hundred species that 5 live downstream. 6 Thank you.7 MS. COGHILL: Thank you. 8 (Applause.)9 MS.

And my wife, Madeline, and I 17 have raised both our kids in this community. 18 I appreciate this opportunity to express my 19 comments and opinions tonight. And I thank 20 the DHS panel for the time they've put in 21 this afternoon and this evening. 22 As you've heard this afternoon and this 23 evening again, there's considerable concern 24 among my neighbors here regarding safety and 25 the risk to this community, both real and cont.| 116| 13.2 117| 19.2cont.| 3| 13.2 1| 19.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 91 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3847 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 125 1 perceived, associated with the study of 2 infectious diseases. This is understandable. 3 You should also know that I and others at 4 the university have worked hard to address 5 these concerns and to build an atmosphere of 6 public confidence and trust, specifically 7 regarding the Animal Health Research Center, 8 one of only BSL-3 ag facilities in the 9 country that's located on a university 10 campus, to my knowledge. 11 We have openly discussed issues regarding 12 the costs, the construction and the operation 13 of this BSL-3 ag facility. We conduct tours. 14 We hold public meetings. And we engage in 15 many one-on-one conversations with concerned 16 individuals in this community. We continue 17 to communicate operational issues and 18 research initiatives through our Community 19 Liaison Committee which was founded -- or 20 set up in 2004. 21 I commend our elected community leaders 22 who have availed themselves of these 23 opportunities and as a result have better 24 understanding of these facilities and what we 25 do in them.

The Draft 8 Environmental Impact Statement that you have 9 provided puts to rest my concerns and -- with 10 locating the lab here in Georgia. 11 And I think there have been other issues 12 that have been raised here that I think 13 you're going to take seriously concerning 14 water uses and other issues. I believe that 15 the opportunities that Athens affords for 16 doing the best science are exceptional. 17 Thank you. 18 MS. COGHILL: Thank you. 19 (Applause.)20 MS.

Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. DHS gave equal consideration to all comments, regardless of how or where they were received. All comments received during the public comment periods have been considered in this NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3849 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 127 1 married to a research scientist in plant 2 pathology at the university . So I have some 3 understanding of research and procedures. 4 I came here tonight with an open mind. I 5 came and I read the posters and I asked 6 questions, and I've listened all evening. 7 And while -- completely aside from whether 8 NBAF is a good idea or not, nothing I have 9 heard tonight has convinced me that this site 10 in Athens is in any way an appropriate site 11 for this facility. The drawbacks of 12 proximity to the river and to the botanical 13 gardens and other environmental concerns have 14 been brought up. 15 There has been no local referendum or 16 similar process for assessing the feelings of 17 the community of Clarke County, yet -- 18 (applause) 19 SUSAN HODGES: -- yet our elected 20 officials, including our mayor and our local 21 commissioners, have spoken tonight as if they 22 represent the people of Clarke County. I 23 don't know how they can know that they're 24 representing their viewpoint. They have not 25 convinced me that Athens-Clarke would be -- 121| 5.2 122| 12.2, 13.21| 25.2 2| 13.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 94 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 13.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern and acknowledges the proximity of the South Milledge Avenue Site to the State Botanical Garden and the Oconee River. As described in Section 3.8.3.1.1 of the NBAF EIS, 80% of the site consists of pasture, and the adjacent lands consist of forested lands and small, perennial headwater streams. Approximately 30 acres of open pasture, 0.2 acres of forested habitat, and less than 0.1 acres of wetlands would be affected by the NBAF. However, construction and normal operations of the NBAF would have no direct impact on the State Botanical Garden as indicated in Sections 3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3. Only minimal indirect effects would occur from operations due to increases in light and noise. As described in Section 3.8.3.2.2, impacts to a headwater stream would impact aquatic resources within a 50-foot reach. However, a properly designed road crossing would have little or no adverse effect on downstream aquatic resources. The impacted stream, which extends into the fenced pasture, has been severely impacted by loss of buffering vegetation and erosion and sedimentation. If the final design plan does not avoid stream impacts, DHS would consider restoration of the unaffected stream segments as mitigation for the impacts. As described in Section 3.8.3.2.3, best management practices and requirements for a stormwater pollution prevention plan would mitigate potential erosion and sedimentation impacts during the construction process. The NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for minor adverse impacts on aquatic communities due to direct stream impacts, stormwater runoff, pollutant transport, and erosion and sedimentation. However, as described in Section 3.8.3.3.1, best management practices and low impact design (LID) features would be used to minimize the potential for such impacts. Preliminary LID measures that are being considered include pervious pavement in both parking lots and pedestrian walkways, capturing and using roof runoff for landscape watering, and grading parking lots to filter storm water through landscaped areas. As described in Section 3.3.3.1.4, sewage acceptance criteria and pretreatment requirements would apply to the wastewater discharged from the proposed NBAF.

My husband collaborates with 11 scientists across the country. This is very 12 possible to do. 13 Finally, I am really disappointed that 14 even though I brought up the issue of water 15 supply this was not addressed by any of our 16 local officials. Where is the water going to 17 come from for this facility, and what is the 18 impact going to be on the community in terms 19 of costs and the availability of potable 20 water in the next twenty years or fifty years 21 or however long this facility is using this 22 water? 23 Nobody has addressed this issue. You 24 folks didn't when I asked earlier.

As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3851 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 129 1 addressed where is the water going to come 2 from for this site? 3 Thank you. 4 MS.

DHS has endeavored to prepare the NBAF EIS utilizing reference sources that are reasonably available for inspection by the public as required by Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1502.21). Further, DHS has and will respond in a timely manner to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of NBAF EIS references or other background documents, which members of the public may have had difficulty locating in the public domain. As cited by the commentor, the Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and the Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study and other support documents were made available on DHS's NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf) in early August 2008 because these studies were commissioned by DHS and not otherwise publicly available. Nevertheless, information from these studies relevant to the NBAF EIS was included in the NBAF Draft EIS published in June 2008. DHS does not believe that any new information has been revealed that would require a supplemental NEPA evaluation.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3852 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 130 1 DHS must complete a new, honest study of the 2 risks involved. Due to this new information 3 and all of the other new information learned 4 by DHS during its public comment period, DHS 5 should prepare a supplemental EIS so the 6 agency can properly consider all of the 7 information before the decision is made and 8 so the public can comment again on all of the 9 information. 10 The Draft Environmental Impact Statement 11 is a very large document. All of the 12 materials that are listed as the supporting 13 documents are enormous and technical. Some 14 of them are listed in the appendices, and 15 some are not. A 45-day comment period to 16 allow the public to seriously digest and 17 comment on this is absurd. It's not 18 sufficient. 19 Thank you. 20 (Applause.)21 MS.

DHS disagrees with the commentor's characterization of the NBAF EIS in these areas. DHS fully complied with notice and provisions of NEPA and Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1502.21). DHS notes the commentor's opinion regarding the length of the public comment period. Council on Environmental Quality regulation 40 CFR 1506.10(c) requires that a minimum of 45 days be allowed for public comment on the NBAF Draft EIS. A period of 60 days was provided for public review and comment on the NBAF Draft EIS, which spanned from June 27 through August 25, 2008. During this comment period, public meetings were held in the vicinity of the NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. DHS also accepted comments submitted by mail, telephone and fax lines, and online through the NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). All comments, both oral and written, received during the comment period were given equal consideration and were responded to in the NBAF Final EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3853 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 131 1 bring with it the unnecessary risks that NBAF 2 would bring. 3 Now, I used to work in economic 4 government development at the state level and 5 I understand Georgia's long history of trying 6 to attract bio-biotech I've even worked to 7 help bring bio-biotech as well as other 8 high-tech industries. I understand the 9 competition that traditionally goes on 10 between Georgia and North Carolina in trying 11 to attract bio-biotech projects. 12 It's a competition in which North 13 Carolina usually wins. But in this case I 14 think it's interesting that North Carolina no 15 longer wants this particular bio-biotech 16 project. I think our local economic 17 developers need to ask themselves why. 18 Well, there are a lot of comments I want 19 to make; and I will be submitting a full list 20 of my comments to DHS. There's some 21 discrepancies in the DEIS I want to talk 22 about at that point, also some omissions I'm 23 concerned about being there. 24 But I want to say tonight, just very 25 briefly, the GAO report suggests that Plum 128| 5.2127| 5.21| 5.2, 25.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 98 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives including the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. DHS has adhered to the NEPA process, which requires agencies to consider the environmental consequences of major Federal actions that could potentially affect the human environment for a full spectrum of reasonable alternatives. The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS show that even though Plum Island has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection process incorporated site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in subburban or sem-urban areas. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3854 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 132 1 Island would be the safest place to build 2 NBAF. The DEIS says the same thing, that 3 Plum Island would be safer than the five 4 mainland locations. And in light of this I 5 just want to say I am appalled that DHS is 6 even still considering the five mainland 7 locations, especially ours here in Athens. 8 Thank you. 9 (Applause.) 10 MS.

I have personal experience 15 in it. So when I hear some people coming up 16 here and telling me and the rest of you that 17 they can run a perfect laboratory and never 18 have anything escape from it, I think they 19 should look for another job. 20 (Applause.)21 DR.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the potential consequences from a NBAF accident as the result of human error. As described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Training and inherent biocontainment safeguards reduce the likelihood of a release. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, including external events such as a terrorist attack. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Oversite of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. DHS notes the commentor's concern about apportionment of financial liability for medical treatment in the event of a pathogen release. However, it is not possible to determine in advance who might be responsible for an incident. DHS will follow applicable local, state, and federal law, whether in asserting or defending against a claim for damages should a pathogen be released from the NBAF.

Then 3 I have people that I've interviewed that are 4 lying to me. They've told me there's no 5 laboratory that doesn't make mistakes. 6 And I'm talking to people who are in the 7 laboratory. And they're not just workers. 8 They're administrators. And we've heard it 9 from our panel. 10 So let's stop fooling ourselves. You're 11 looking at a dangerous laboratory coming in 12 here. 13 Now, who's going to pay for your illness 14 that you get from the laboratory? What 15 arrangements do they have in this 16 thousand-page document that says if the 17 pathogens get out and a community suffers a 18 breakdown in disease who's going to pay for 19 it? 20 If it's an incurable disease then your 21 Medicare doesn't pay for it. There has to be 22 a cure for it before they pay. I know. I've 23 got one of them.

And do 21 you know what suffers when you cut the budget 22 with a laboratory? The security is the first 23 thing to suffer.

Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns about the sustainability of funding for NBAF to ensure safe and secure operations. The U.S. Congress and the President are responsible for determining funding priorities for government programs. DHS spends funds in accordance with congressional intent. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide for safe operation and maintenance.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3857 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 135 1 little more money and they say well, we have 2 other projects this year, maybe next time. 3 That is the situation. 4 Thank you. 5 (Applause.)6 MS.

The emphasis on the 10 potential economic rewards reminded me of a 11 quote from my father: Follow the green and 12 if it sounds like it's too good to be true, 13 it is. 14 Thirdly, it is more than blatantly 15 obvious that many of the university and 16 affiliates were swayed by prestige, by 17 egocentric rewards, by peer pressure.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in DEIS Section 2.3.1. A multi-disciplinary team of engineers, scientists, lawyers, academics and communicators from the departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Defense reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3862 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 140 1 isolated.

He's an associate professor of 18 pathology at the University of Missouri and 19 an interim medical examiner in the state. 20 And he said why would a group of respected 21 citizens, including business people, 22 scientists, university administrators and 23 politicians, attempt to recruit a Level 4 24 research facility that handles treacherous 25 agents to our town. 141| 25.2 142| 2.0, 5.0140| 25.2 141| 2.0,5.01| 25.2 2| 5.0, 2.0 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 108 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.

I'm district 16 manager with AT&T here in Athens. And I 17 stand in front of you today wearing a few 18 different hats. 19 First of all, I represent a company that 20 serves Athens. As such, we're concerned 21 about maintaining and improving the economic 22 vitality of the community. 23 We're also involved in being a part of 24 initiatives that's helped the community like 25 Athens we've served for 126 years.

I drive by it 7 every day. It's beautiful and situated near 8 very good roads and infrastructure. And as 9 I've read all about the building and the work 10 to be conducted there, I'm convinced my 11 family will be at no greater safety risk than 12 when they drive the Athens Bypass. 13 For all the discussion around the safety 14 aspects -- and there have been many good 15 questions in that regard -- it's always been 16 notable to me that the scientists who will be 17 doing this research will actually live here 18 too. 19 As a result of the Brack (phonetic 20 spelling) process the Naval Supply Corps 21 School in Athens closes in three years.

We believe this project 4 conforms to our community profile very well 5 and the potential benefits to the world are 6 enormous. 7 As your research has already shown, 8 Athens is an outstanding small city with an 9 amazing university-based population and a 10 highly-educated work force. Your location in 11 Athens is extremely successful as it joins an 12 astonishing array of research facilities and 13 existing international life science 14 companies. 15 We have a skilled work force job training 16 facility, suppliers, complementary academic 17 and private sector research to maximize your 18 growing efficiency. And we have all of that 19 in place now. 20 The benefits to NBAF to agriculture, 21 wildlife and public health and safety are 22 globally significant. The development of new 23 vaccines, diagnostic procedures and rapid 24 response to foreign animal diseases would 25 protect animal health in our hemisphere. cont.| 149| 24.2 8.2 3| 1.0 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 116 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 8.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for the proposed research that would be conducted within the NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3872 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 150 1 We have asked the pertinent questions of 2 our existing life science professionals and 3 appreciate their candor. We believe that a 4 very limited risk in locating this facility 5 versus the positive impact of so many issues 6 are -- are more than acceptable and the 7 environmental impacts are minimal. 8 Visual and traffic impacts are less than 9 it would be for building a hospital or a new 10 high school. And all other effects are minor 11 or negligible and will be mitigated through 12 the above agencies and regulations. 13 In conclusion, we strongly believe that 14 NBAF as an integral part of our research 15 community will be a successful and 16 Athens-Clarke County and will complement our 17 existing scientific community. The facility 18 will be a significant economic driver. Yet 19 its greatest value to the community is the 20 addition of a global research facility to our 21 existing health science cluster of companies. 22 And the fact that it is here will assist us 23 in attracting biotech industries to Athens. 24 Your positive position is appreciated. 25 Thank you. 152| 5.2 153| 7.2 154| 5.2 5| 7.2 6| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 117 of 132 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's support for the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.

But also 12 I've been amazed at the number of people who 13 have not wanted to come forward and speak 14 about this because -- and I know you guys 15 don't mean this at the university probably. 16 I want to give you the benefit of the doubt. 17 But people really feel like their jobs will 18 be threatened if they speak against it. 19 (Applause.)20 PAT PRIEST: And that's not just at the 21 university.

Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 23 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, toll- free telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3874 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 152 1 MS. COGHILL: I need you to turn just a 2 little bit more. You might want to --3 PAT PRIEST: Yes. I'm sure you heard me. 4 Don't you? 5 COURT REPORTER: (Nods head affirmatively.)6 PAT PRIEST: You folks have spent so much 7 time, and I appreciate that. But I also want 8 to speak to people, my friends like Heidi 9 Davison, my friends Doug Lowry and Doc 10 Eldridge. I know you do the balancing 11 differently. It's not fair to vilify you 12 guys. 13 But I think that it's -- what's important 14 to remember is that there are very few more 15 pro-social and life-affirming monies out 16 there. And that's what we need to change, 17 something like soil conservation or embryonic 18 research. That's where we need money. 19 So with a new administration in power we 20 can perhaps have that. And maybe this will 21 go away. But we can't count on that. 22 And so I especially thank you guys on 23 your leadership on that. I know it seems 24 prudent and, in fact, necessary to fight this 25 by bringing, you know, this germ lab that may 156| 15.2155| 15.2cont.| 1| 15.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 119 of 132 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3875 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 153 1 seem at first blush to be a good idea. 2 President Reagan had the Star Wars 3 Initiative that he spent billions on. And 4 that, in fact, caused an escalation of 5 weapons development. And we risk that 6 escalation. But we also have greater risk by 7 a single mishap, a single mad scientist or, 8 you know, a single terrorist attack will 9 threaten us. 10 In fact, you guys say this will come, 11 this will come. It's going to come because 12 you guys would bring it here. You would 13 bring these -- these pathogens. 14 (Applause.)15 PAT PRIEST: You know, we already have 16 this toxic effect. And that's in the way 17 we're separated and divisive about this. 18 And so I hope there's not like a big 19 nuclear power plant or something that's next 20 in line that is -- yes, that would bring 21 jobs. But I instead hope that we will work 22 together. 23 And there's a great local historian in 24 town named Steve Sturrey (phonetic spelling). 25 Thank you. And he is -- he talks about how 157| 21.2 158| 19.2 159| 21.2 3| 19.2 4| 13.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 120 of 132 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement. DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States. DHS notes the commentor's concern about safety. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only)(TRA) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high- consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's lack of confidence in the DHS. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS state that the specific objective of the hazard identification is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Appendix B describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF then site-specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed the NBAF. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 13.2Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3876 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding potential effects on the Middle Oconee River at the South Milledge Avenue Site. Implementation of approved erosion control measures, utilization of LID storm water pollution prevention measures, and compliance with wastewater treatment standards would prevent significant impacts on downstream aquatic resources such as the Middle Oconee River. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3877 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 154 1 the Native American people called certain 2 people and places in this area as beloved. 3 Thank you. And one of these beloved places 4 was the Oconee River. And I think we've all 5 been awakened to the fact that this is a 6 beloved place. 7 And what I'd like to see us do is work 8 together, maybe to use SPLOST funds to 9 protect and save this place, not put a drain 10 on it, in fact, put nothing there. Let's 11 work to save it and keep it pristine. 12 Thank you. 13 (Applause.)14 MS. COGHILL: Joellen Childers will be 15 our next speaker. Joellen. 16 JOELLEN CHILDERS: Thank you. 17 Hi. My name is Joellen Childers, and I 18 live here in Athens. And I am staff at the 19 university. 20 I want especially to thank people who 21 felt their backs were against the wall and 22 they had to pass a lot of great federal law 23 and regulation that created this gathering 24 here tonight and that created the need for a 25 draft EIS and created the need for yet 5| 25.2 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 121 of 132 Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative and would like to preserve the site.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3878 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 155 1 another step in terms of there being a final 2 EIS. 3 This public comment has not -- kind of 4 thing has not always been in place. And if 5 it hadn't been for people who felt they had 6 to institute that kind of thing -- we're 7 fortunate to have that. I bring that up 8 because we also live in a very interesting 9 state. 10 The Open Record Requirements in the state 11 of Georgia for the state government are 12 really quite extraordinary, from what I 13 understand. And I want for people everywhere 14 to know that we're kind of at the brink that 15 it's annoying to me when people talk again 16 and again about transparency. There really 17 is no requirement -- we're coming to a point 18 where there are no requirements in terms of 19 transparency. Some things may be published, 20 they may not be published. Who knows. 21 We're really entering a zone where we're 22 not going to know a hell of a lot about what 23 would be going on at this facility. There 24 are no disclosure requirements. 25 It is the human factor in all of this 161| 4.2 162| 2.2160| 4.2 161| 2.21| 4.2 2| 2.0 August 14, 2008, Athens, GA, Athens Evening Page 122 of 132 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.2 DHS notes the commentor's statement about the importance of transparency for public records. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. NBAF would incorporate modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, as further discussed in Section 2.2.1.1 of the NBAF EIS. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS, and a description of potential safeguards can be found in the NBAF Engineering Technical Feasibility Study. As noted in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, an Institutional Biosafety Committee, comprised of interdisciplinary expertise, safety experts and community representatives, would review and approve of the use of any biological agent. DHS also notes the commentor's questions regarding the public availability and transparency of NBAF research. There would no classifed research at the NBAF, however there may occasionally be classified FBI forensics cases. Currently, the PIADC facility publishes research in publicly available research journals; NBAF would publish its research in publicly available research journals as well.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3879 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 156 1 that I think is really hard to calculate. 2 Certainly at the University of Texas -- at 3 Texas A&M there have been the discovery -- 4 the way-after-the-fact discovery of some 5 incidents at that institution. And I think 6 it's very much human nature to cover things 7 up. 8 In fact, we may be living in an age of 9 public relations where that is a very 10 prominent feature of institutions everywhere. 11 And this can leave us who are very, very 12 concerned about the public good very much in 13 the lurch. 14 Thank you very much for your time. 15 MS.

A discussion of the planned improvements to the area's primary transportation corridors of South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road to alleviate current and future traffc congestion resulting from the NBAF operation at the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative is located in Section 3.11.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. All planned improvements are per the recommendations of the Department of Transporation and the Public Works Department. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's views on risk. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, would enable the NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative. As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection process incorporated site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in subburban or sem-urban areas. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative due to safety concerns. As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas.

Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 9.2 DHS notes the commentor's air and water concerns. The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Section 3.4.1 describes the methodology used in assessing potential air quality consequences at each site. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Section 3.13. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards. Section 3.7.3 describes the water resources at the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative including potential construction and operational consequences.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3881 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 158 1 concern, why place this BSL-4 smack in the 2 middle of our tiny community. Humans do make 3 mistakes, and they will at this lab. 4 I have been receiving flyers all summer 5 from the ACC about water saving tips since we 6 are in a drought. It has been irresponsible 7 of our leaders to offer money and land to a 8 facility that will use over a hundred 9 thousand gallons of water a day. We are 10 being told to limit our shower time, collect 11 rainwater for our plants and limit how much 12 we flush our toilets. How dare our leaders 13 then turn around and offer accommodations for 14 NBAF. 15 (Applause.)16 LAURA FLEURY: After the last meeting I 17 was approached by David Lee, who was 18 surprised when I said earlier that UGA 19 students were in the dark about NBAF. But 20 how can the students know of the risk and 21 concern when the information we're given is 22 highly filtered by the university and 23 politicians with ties to the local 24 newspapers.

The students 4 keep the city alive and kicking. 5 So I end by asking this question: Does 6 this site have the best in mind for the 7 students and citizens of Athens? It doesn't 8 seem that way to me. A wise man once told me 9 to follow the green. And it seems to me that 10 this project is financially and politically 11 driven with no care and concern for the 12 people of Athens. 13 Please keep us, the students and 14 citizens, safe by keeping NBAF out of Athens. 15 Thank you. 16 (Applause.)17 MS.

DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A team of Federal employees representing multi-department component offices and multi-governmental agencies (DHS, U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], and Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]) reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3883 10259a45-0153-4954-a119-de07587bc05cPage 160 1 why are all the sites in the southeast, where 2 there's a tradition of impoverishment and 3 lack of vigorous community involvement. 4 I'd like to ask why is there not a site 5 in Vermont, why not Cornell University, which 6 has an outstanding agro-science area. And 7 I'd like to ask why is it Georgia, 8 Mississippi, Texas, North Carolina. 9 We don't need this kind of prestige. 10 What we need is quality of life. 11 (Applause.)12 LAURIN SMITH: And I don't want to vilify 13 people who think we do, who personally think 14 that we need this, because I know that myself 15 I would love to have certain things here 16 which would enhance my career and my 17 activities.

So there's direct 5 benefit there. 6 On the other hand, there's safety and 7 trust. And for those of us who follow on 8 that side, which I do, then that's our 9 decision that would go on. 10 If you bring it here or probably even if 11 you bring it on the mainland it's because 12 somebody has pandered to the money. And they 13 have encouraged you. 14 UGA's offered up a lot of money. Our 15 local politicians have offered up a lot of 16 money.

I know many of you 7 sat through and participated in the meeting 8 this afternoon, and we very much appreciate 9 that. 10 And I said at the conclusion of the 11 afternoon meeting I think the comments have 12 been very helpful, meaningful. I think, you 13 know, probably more than from the other 14 sites. And there's been some very specific 15 comments on the EIS. And it will help us 16 draft a very informed final EIS. 17 So, again, if you think of a comment 18 later that maybe you didn't make one tonight, 19 whether in writing or in person, you can 20 submit it at a later time, as long as you get 21 it in by August 25th. Again, you've seen 22 this slide with the various mechanisms we 23 have to submit your comments. 24 So I want to thank everyone again for 25 coming.
