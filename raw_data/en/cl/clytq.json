This and raised in Tabola Village. Mangku Mastra is a Healer, Yoga and Meditation Instructor, but his 'Chakra' Massage is, without doubt, a unique spiritual and emotional experience for those that seek him out. The Chakra Massage is designed to open the 7 main energy centres of your body using mantras (a series of chants which create thought-energy waves). These, together with herbs and oil (created by Mangku Mastra himself) are not only used to realign your body' energy but also to transfer energy. Many have witnessed Mangku Mastras energy first hand and for sure, some has said that 'he definitely has connections higher than others! Maybe as an outsider, one has little understanding or even acceptance of Balinese beliefs and this may even seem imaginative to some, but these beliefs are deeply embedded in the very structure and value of daily life Suggested duration 1-2 hours Suggest edits to improve what we show.

Pak Mangku apparently also a priest in the village, he is quite busy so to make an appointment in advance is highly recommended. He was easily screening my physical and mentally problem from only making a conversation prior the massage rituals. The massage itself is very comforting as i personally like a medium to strong pressure, and he explained which part he will touch, what aura color of each parts and ask me to tell him if i dont comfortable with the massage. I will surely do Chakra massage with Pak Mangku again whenever i come to Sidemen. Thank you Pak Mangku Mastra to remind me to let go everything and be grateful, i wont forget that...Visited December 2019Traveled soloWritten January 1, 2020 - Genuine Life AdviceI had a very incredible, special experience doing the chakra massage with Mangku Mastra. Usually I am very skeptical when it comes to any sort of spiritual healing offered at a resort type place, but my experience with Mangku Mastra was exceptional. He had a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share with me and I really felt safe and comfortable - like I could trust that he had nothing but good intentions. He gave me a lot of advice on how to live my life to the fullest and afterwards I felt rejuvenated, clear, and positive. I think it is wrong to assume that one hour of healing can fix you for good (though a friend of mine said his anxiety was cured afterwards), but I would recommend this experience to anyone who wants to heal, grow spiritually, and will take the sometimes difficult truth in a way that's productive. I will be visiting again for sure. Pak Mangku Mastra terrima kasih banyak!Visited May 2021Written May 21, 2021 - ONE OF A KIND EXPERIENCEMy partner and I had an amazing one-of-a-kind experience on Chakra massage with Mangku Mastra. This is definitely a different kind of massage and anyone who are coming to Sidemen must give it a try. We were staying at Samanvaya and stumbled upon the massage from the SPA menu and decided to give it a try. It was an interesting discovery about the 7 Chakra and the flow of energy in the body. Mangku Mastra is a very jolly & talkative man, and I have also enjoyed a deep conversation with him during the session. The massage was excellent, his hands are strong and warm, and he definitely knows what he is doing. All you need to do is trust the process and come with an open mind. It was also interesting to discover Pak Mangku being a healer & a holy man in Sidemen. He is an highly respected man and a unique person, the Chakra massage, and also his Yoga session are his special programme and only can be done by him alone. That made the visit to Sidemen extra special because we found him. Will we come back again? Oh definitely yes. Do make this as one of the highlights if you visit Bali.Visited December 2020Written December 25, 2020 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Without me saying anything, he independently identified my blockages and got my energy flowing again. I am still overwhelmed by his work. He is truly recommended and an insider tip that everyone should have on their list who wants to feel their energy again.

Oct 2022 Had 2 chakra massages with him. I've had chakra massages in multiple countries and each is completely different. His is quite painful and vigorous. It is a sort of scraping massage. He does unusual things like pulling your ears. It's not a crystals, sound bowls or Reiki type chakra massage at all. Having said that, you do feel deeply relaxed after that. He is very intuitive and picked up on my physical and stress issues. I am a female doctor and I know that some women are more uncomfortable about being touched in some areas than others. If you're one of those, I would suggest that you not get this massage but personally I found it totally fine and found the experience excellent.

Sep 2022 Solo It was a emotional rollercoaster. I did know it wasn't a relaxing massage. And because i was fully blocked by stress and a burn out i did know it was gonna hurt. But at the and it were not tears from pain. It was from letting things go. From feeling releaved. I would recomend this to everyone!

Sep 2022 My experience with Mangku Mastra was profound. His take on what to work on with me was right on, without my having to say anything to him. He spoke with me after the massage to give me a suggested practice and I feel like his advice was meeting the very issue that I know myself to have. Was there some pain during the massage? If you have ever been through a rolfing session, I would compare the level of pain to rolfing. It was tolerable but not easy at times....other times it felt strong and really good. I could see in his eyes and feel in his presence that I could trust him. could trust him.
