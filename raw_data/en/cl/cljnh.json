The energy felt by the recipient flows into their physical body, emotional body, spiritual body and their mind. The feeling that the person is left with is peace, warmth, safety, womb-like cradling, and a lightness of spirit. Reiki is a wonderful energy treatment for the subtle bodies. Some recipients feel a profound shift after just one session. The word Reiki is made up of two Japanese words - Rei which means, \"God's Wisdom or the Higher Power\" and Ki which is, \"life force energy\". So Reiki is actually \"spiritually guided life force energy.\" Reiki is a method of healing involving the light laying of hands on the recipient's head, neck, heart, abdomen, knees and feet. The recipient is fully clothed on a massage table and can sleep if they wish. Reiki invites us to live in harmony with ourselves and with others. A Reiki session can be seen, in a way, as a \"coming home\" to your true, authentic, loving self. Reiki is a wonderful, energetic support during times of stress and healing. For those that are experiencing major shifts or a \"dark night of the soul\", I recommend a weekly Reiki session until you get back on your feet. Reiki and energy healing can also be done as a distance healing modality. This is ideal for someone that is homebound or has a specific event needing extra support, such as surgery or other big event. Distance Reiki sessions always include a phone call at the beginning and end of treatment. "}
