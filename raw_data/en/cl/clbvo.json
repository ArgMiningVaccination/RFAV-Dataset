EHBs include ambulatory services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse disorder services (including behavioral health treatment), prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management, and pediatric services to the extent required by HHS and the EHB-benchmark plan. These EHBs are subject to change at any time to conform to applicable laws and regulations. This list is available through our Member Services department. Health Plan certifies that this EOC covers Essential Health Benefits to the full extent required by law, except pediatric oral care services are not covered. Coverage for pediatric oral care should either be obtained via a stand-alone (independent) dental plan or via a \"bundled\" qualified health plan (QHP) purchased from Kaiser Permanente Hawaii Region (if purchased through us, the benefit will be described in the Benefit Summary in the front of this Guide), in accordance with applicable law. \"Bundled\" qualified health plans are medical plans that have been certified and approved as a QHP, in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and are bundled with a stand-alone exchange-certified pediatric dental plan from Hawaii Dental Service (HDS). Information regarding dental benefits should be obtained directly from HDS. All other terms of coverage in this EOC applicable to Essential Health Benefits remain effective, including but not limited to the Exclusions and Limitations section of this EOC and the requirement that covered services be provided by or arranged by a Physician and be provided at a Medical Office, Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility, except where such terms of coverage are specifically limited in this EOC (such as for emergency services) or would violate applicable law. EHBs are provided upon payment of any applicable Deductible and Cost Shares listed in the Benefit Summary in the front of this Guide. This section describes EHBs that are not described in other parts of this Guide. These EHBs are subject to all coverage requirements described in other parts of this EOC.

This applies for each covered prescription. If you get a prescription from a non-Kaiser Permanente pharmacy, you will be responsible for 100% of the charges because it is not covered under this Prescription Drug Rider.

A drug that is on the Health Plan formulary, contains the same active ingredient as a Brand-Name Drug, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being therapeutically equivalent, and having the same active ingredients(s) as the Brand-name Drug. Generic Drugs are produced and sold under their Generic names after the patent of the Brand-Name drug expires.

A very high-cost drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are on the Health Plan formulary. Annual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum. TheAnnual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum is the maximum amount for Pharmacy Dispensed Drugs you pay out of your pocket in a calendar year. Once you meet the Annual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum, you are no longer responsible for Cost Share amounts for covered Pharmacy Dispensed Drugs for the remainder of that calendar year. o\"Pharmacy Dispensed Drugs\" include all covered safe to self-administer pharmacy dispensed drugs, including but not limited to inhalers, insulin, chemotherapy drugs, contraceptive drugs/devices, and tobacco cessation drugs. oAll incurred Cost Share and prescription drug deductibles (if applicable) for Pharmacy Dispensed Drugs count toward the Annual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum, and are credited toward the calendar year in which they were received. oNote: The following medical items count toward the Annual Copayment Maximum and not the Annual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum: skilled administered drugs, diabetes Drug_$0_$5_10p_10p_KPIF EOC_Aca_21r.Docx Drug-4 rev. 4/2020 supplies to operate diabetes equipment, lancets, syringes, and drugs that are not dispensed from the pharmacy because they are not safe to self-administer. oPayments made by you or on your behalf for non-covered services, or for benefits excluded under this EOC do not count toward the Annual Copayment Maximum nor the Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum. oIt is recommended that you keep receipts as proof of your payments. All payments are credited toward the calendar year in which the services were received. Annual Prescription Drug Deductible. The Annual Prescription Drug Deductible is the amount you must pay for certain types of self-administered prescription drugs in a calendar year before we will cover those drugs. Once you meet the Annual Prescription Drug Deductible, you are no longer responsible for prescription drug deductible amounts for the remainder of the calendar year, and you pay the Cost Share shown in the Benefit Summary. oEach Member must meet the \"per Member\" Annual Prescription Drug Deductible, or the Family Unit must meet the \"family unit\" Annual Drug Deductible. o The \"per Member\" Annual Prescription Drug Deductible amount counts toward the \"per family unit\" Annual Prescription Drug Deductible amount.

Consequently, payments toward any other deductible do not count toward the Annual Prescription Drug Deductible. oPayments toward the Annual Prescription Drug Deductible also count toward the limit on Annual Prescription Drug Copayment Maximum. About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is considered a closed formulary, which means that medications on the list are usually covered under the prescription drug rider. However, drugs on our formulary may not be automatically covered under your prescription drug rider depending on which plan you've selected. Even though nonformulary drugs are generally not covered under your prescription drug rider, your Kaiser Permanente physician can sometimes request a nonformulary drug for you, specifically when formulary alternatives have failed or use of nonformulary drug is Medically Necessary, provided -- the drug is not excluded under the prescription drug rider. Kaiser Permanente pharmacies may substitute a chemical or generic equivalent for a brand- name/specialty drug unless this is prohibited by your Kaiser Permanente physician. If you want a brand- name/specialty drug for which there is a generic equivalent, or if you request a non-formulary drug, you will be charged Member Rates for these selections, since they are not covered under your prescription drug rider. If your Kaiser Permanente physician deems a higher priced drug to be Medically Necessary when a less expensive drug is available, you pay the usual drug Cost Share. If you request the higher priced drug and it has not been deemed Medically Necessary, you will be charged Member Rates. Note: If your prescription allows refills, there are limits to how early you can receive a refill. We will refill your prescription when you have used at least 75 percent of the quantity, unless otherwise directed by Kaiser Permanente. Please ask your pharmacy if you have questions about when you can get a covered refill.

You must receive your health care from Kaiser Permanente providers and in Kaiser Permanente facilities within our Service Area except for these services: Written and authorized referrals (by a Kaiser Permanente provider and/or our Authorizations and Referrals department) Emergency care Out-of-state Urgent Care when traveling Dependent child benefits (as described in this EOC) while out-of-state Needing a Referral When Seeing a Specialist Our PCPs offer primary medical, pediatric, and OB/GYN care. Kaiser Permanente Specialists provide specialty care in areas such as surgery, orthopedics, cardiology, urology, oncology, and dermatology. Your PCP will refer you to a Kaiser Permanente Specialist when appropriate. In most cases, you will need a referral to see a Kaiser Permanente Specialist for the first time. Your PCP will coordinate and monitor any care you may require from an appropriate Kaiser Permanente Specialist. The Referral Process First, your PCP will look for a Physician or facility within Kaiser Permanente to treat you. If a specialty Physician or facility is not available within Kaiser Permanente, your PCP will refer you to a Physician or facility within the Kaiser Permanente contracted network of providers. When you go to a specialty Physician's office or a facility, you should do both of the following; Present your Kaiser Permanente member ID card. Inform the Physician or nurse that you have been referred by your Kaiser Permanente PCP. If, in the professional judgment of Medical Group, you require medical or hospital services covered by this EOC which require skills not available within Medical Group or facilities not available in Kaiser Permanente, and Medical Group determines that it would be in the best interest for you to obtain care from another source, then, upon written referral by Medical Group to the facility/practitioner designated by Medical Group, and upon you receiving prior written authorization by Kaiser Permanente, payment, in lieu of medical service benefits hereunder, is made for prescribed medical services within the coverage of this EOC. This may include referral to sources outside the Service Area, if deemed Medically Necessary by a Medical Group Physician and approved by Medical Group. Your PCP will work with Health Plan and submit an administrative review request prior to services being rendered by a non-KP or out-of-state physician or facility. As an HMO, referrals are required before accessing service to avoid being responsible for the full cost of the medical services. Deductibles (if applicable) and Cost Shares for referred care are the same as those required for medical services provided by a KP provider. You will only be covered for the medical services listed as covered under this 2021 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 6 Chapter 1: Important Information EOC. If your PCP does not provide or arrange for your services where a referral is required, you are responsible for the cost of the medical services. Referral Limitations Benefits for referred care are limited to those covered services described in this Guide. Should your provider recommend or perform services that are not covered by this Guide or do not meet payment determination criteria, or should a referral be suspended for quality of care or patient safety reasons, you are responsible for all charges related to the service. See the section Questions We Ask When You Receive Care later in this chapter.

The last day of coverage is the last day of the month following the month that notice of ineligibility is sent to the Subscriber or Family Dependent. The Subscriber or Family Dependent may request an earlier termination than set forth in this paragraph, if desired. Note: If the Subscriber is no longer eligible for continued enrollment (has membership terminated), the Subscriber's Family Dependents are not eligible for continued enrollment beyond the Subscriber's termination date. Continuation of Coverage and Change of Residence Continuation of Coverage A Family Dependent residing in the Service Area who loses coverage due to loss of eligibility may continue Health Plan membership with no break in coverage by enrolling in certain Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families Plans if he or she meets the eligibility criteria of that plan. However, the Family Dependent must complete, sign and submit to Health Plan the applicable enrollment form as a Subscriber on that plan. Subscriber membership begins when: 1)Family Dependent membership ends, and 2)a timely submitted and signed enrollment form has been accepted by Health Plan, and 3)Subscriber has prepaid the applicable Monthly Premiums required for membership. The Family Dependent must apply to us to be a Subscriber on that plan within 31 calendar days if on a Grandfathered plan (60 calendar days if on a Non-Grandfathered plan) after ceasing to qualify as a 2021 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 72 Chapter 6: Membership Information Family Dependent under this EOC. To continue with Grandfathered coverage, you must apply before your termination effective date. If a Family Dependent does not continue membership by the conversion procedure described above, he/she has no rights to benefits under this EOC, and will be responsible for full charges for any services received by the Family Dependent after losing eligibility. Continuation of coverage is not permitted for a Subscriber or Family Dependents (except for dependents under age 26) residing outside of the Service Area, nor for a person whose membership we terminate for a reason stated in the Member Termination Provisions section of this Chapter. Note: After the 31 calendar day period if on a Grandfathered plan (60 calendar day period if on a Non- Grandfathered ACA plan), Family Dependents have the option to apply for one of our Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") individual plans during an individual annual open enrollment or special enrollment period. All plans have specific eligibility and enrollment criteria that must be met. Change of Residence - General We may terminate the membership of any Member (except Family Dependents under age 26) who move outside the Service Area, in accord with the Member Termination Provisions section of this chapter. Subscriber must provide immediate written notice to us regarding any Member who moves outside of the Service Area. The only benefits covered by this Guide outside the Service Area prior to termination of membership are Emergency and Urgent Care Services specified in the Emergency Services and Urgent Care sections in Chapter 3: Benefit Description in this Guide. Members who move to another Kaiser service area can contact the Member Services department in that service area to apply for membership there. Member Termination Provisions When Health Plan terminates your membership, neither Health Plan, Hospitals, Medical Group, nor any Kaiser Permanente provider has any further liability or responsibility under this EOC, for any Services obtained after the Member's termination date. All rights to medical services and other benefits under this EOC end at 11:59 PM on the termination date specified by us. Any termination of Subscriber's membership for any of the reasons in this Member Termination Provisions section will also terminate the membership of all Family Dependents, as of the same termination date as the Subscriber. Termination of membership terminates all coverage rights under this EOC. Services received after the termination date will not be covered and the Members will be responsible for all charges. Members may not enroll in any Kaiser Permanente plan if membership is terminated for non-payment (subject to the provisions listed in the \"Termination for Nonpayment\" section in this Chapter for Members on a Non-Grandfathered plan) or for cause, as described in this Chapter of the EOC. A Member's membership may also be terminated if Health Plan stops offering this plan or 2) all Kaiser Permanente non-group plans in Hawaii.

If we do not receive your portion of the Monthly Premiums on time, we will send you a notice about your failure to pay Monthly Premiums on time and your grace period (the time frame in which you must pay your overdue Monthly Premium to avoid termination) and whether coverage continues during this grace period.

Initiating Binding Arbitration A demand for arbitration shall be initiated by sending a registered or certified letter to each named party against whom the claim is made, with a notice of the existence and nature of the claim, the amount claimed and a demand for arbitration. Any Kaiser Permanente Parties shall be served by registered or certified letter, postage prepaid, addressed to the Kaiser Permanente Parties in care of the Health Plan at the address set forth in this EOC. The arbitrators shall have jurisdiction only over persons and entities actually served. Arbitration Proceedings Within 30 days after the service of the demand for arbitration, the parties shall agree on a panel of arbitrators from which to select arbitrators or shall agree on particular arbitrators who shall serve for the case. If the parties cannot agree on any panel of arbitrators or particular arbitrators within the 30 days, then the panel of arbitrators shall be that of Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc. (\"DPR\"). Unless the parties agree to any other arbitration service and rules, DPR shall administer the arbitration and its arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration (including rules for selection of arbitrators from a panel of arbitrators, if the parties have not already agreed upon particular arbitrators to serve). Kaiser Permanente shall notify DPR (or such other arbitration service as may be chosen by the parties) of the arbitration within 15 days following the expiration of the 30-day period noted above. Within 30 calendar days after notice to Dispute Prevention and Resolution, Inc., the parties shall select a panel of three arbitrators from a list submitted to them by the arbitration service. In all claims seeking a total monetary recovery less than $25,000.00, and in any other case where the parties mutually agree, a panel of one arbitrator selected by both parties from a list submitted to them by the arbitration service will be allowed. The arbitrator(s) will arrange to hold a hearing in Honolulu (or such other location as agreed by the parties) within a reasonable time thereafter. Limited civil discovery shall be permitted only for: production of documents that are relevant and material, taking of brief depositions of treating Physicians, expert witnesses and parties (a corporate party shall designate the person to be deposed on behalf of the corporation) and a maximum of three other critical witnesses for each side (i.e., respondents or claimants), and independent medical evaluations. 2021 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 80 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution The arbitrator(s) will resolve any discovery disputes submitted by any party, including entry of protective orders or other discovery orders as appropriate to protect the parties' rights under this paragraph. Any payment for the fees and expenses of the arbitration service and the arbitrator(s) shall be borne one-third by the Member Parties and two-thirds by the Kaiser Permanente Parties. Each party shall bear their own attorney's fees, witness fees, and discovery costs. The arbitrator(s) may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue, upon request of one party to the proceeding with notice to all other parties and a reasonable opportunity for the other parties to respond. The standards applicable to such request shall be those applicable to analogous motions for summary judgment or dismissal under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In claims involving benefits and coverage due under this EOC or disputes involving operation of the Plan, Health Plan's determinations and interpretations, and its decisions on these matters are subject to de novo review. The arbitration award shall be final and binding. The Member Parties and Kaiser Permanente Parties waive their rights to jury or court trial. With respect to any matter not expressly provided for herein, the arbitration will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Chapter 1. General Provisions All claims based upon the same incident, transaction or related circumstances regarding the same Member or same patient shall be arbitrated in one proceeding (for example, all Member Parties asserting claims arising from an injury to the same Health Plan Member, shall be arbitrated in one proceeding). A claim for arbitration shall be waived and forever barred if on the date notice thereof is received, the claim, if it were then asserted in a civil action, would be barred by the applicable Hawaii statute of limitations. All notices or other papers required to be served or convenient in the conduct of arbitration proceedings following the initial service shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to such address as each party gives for this purpose. If the Federal Arbitration Act or other law applicable to these arbitration terms is deemed to prohibit any term in this EOC in any particular case, then such term(s) shall be severable in that case and the remainder of this EOC shall not be affected thereby. Class actions and consolidation of parties asserting claims regarding multiple members or patients are prohibited. The arbitration provisions in this EOC shall supersede those in any prior EOC. Arbitration confidentiality Neither party nor the arbitrator(s) may disclose the substance of the arbitration proceedings or award, except as required by law or as necessary to file a motion regarding the award pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, in any federal or state court of appropriate jurisdiction within Hawaii, and in that event, the 2021 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 81 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution parties shall take all appropriate action to request that the records of the arbitration be submitted to the court under seal. Special Claims Medical Malpractice Claims Prior to initiating any arbitration proceedings alleging medical malpractice, Member Parties shall first submit the claim to a Medical Inquiry and Conciliation Panel pursuant to Chapter 671, Hawaii Revised Statutes, Sections 11-19. Following the rendering of an advisory decision by the Medical Inquiry and Conciliation Panel, if the claim has not been withdrawn or settled, Member Parties shall serve a demand for arbitration on Kaiser Permanente Parties as specified in this Chapter. External Appeal of Internal Review Decisions If you disagree with Kaiser Permanente's final internal determination, you shall request binding arbitration pursuant to the procedures in this EOC. In addition to the arbitration procedures set forth in this EOC, Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 432E also creates certain external review rights to submit a request for external review to the State Insurance Commissioner within one hundred thirty days from the date of Kaiser Permanente's final internal determination. These rights are subject to the limitations noted at the end of this subsection, and subject to the requirements and limitations in Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 432E (including exhaustion of Kaiser Permanente's internal claims and appeals procedures before requesting external review, except as specified in Chapter 432E for situations when simultaneous external review is permitted to occur or Kaiser Permanente has failed to comply with federal requirements regarding its claims and appeals process). A complete description of Kaiser Permanente's claims and appeals procedures is described in the Member Handbook. Chapter 432E external reviews are limited to situations where (a) the complaint is not for allegations of medical malpractice, professional negligence or other professional fault by health care providers, and (b) the complaint relates to an adverse action as defined in Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 432E. An adverse action is a Health Plan determination that a health care service that is a covered benefit has been reviewed and denied, reduced or terminated because it does not meet Health Plan's requirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care, or effectiveness. Health Plan objects to external reviews under Chapter 432E which do not meet these criteria, and reserves its full rights and remedies in this regard. The recitation of State law provisions shall not be deemed to constitute any waiver of such objections. 2021 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 82 Chapter 9: Coordination of Benefits Chapter 9: Coordination of Benefits Coordination of Benefits If You are Hospitalized When Coverage Begins Medicare Third Party Liability Special provisions for Members Entitled to Medicare Benefits U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Coordination of Benefits You may have other insurance coverage that provides benefits that are the same or similar to this plan.

Health Plan certifies that this EOC covers Essential Health Benefits to the full extent required by law, except pediatric oral care services are not covered. Coverage for pediatric oral care should either be obtained via a stand-alone (independent) dental plan or via a \"bundled\" qualified health plan (QHP) purchased from Kaiser Permanente Hawaii Region ((if purchased through us, the benefit will be described in the Benefit Summary in the front of this Guide), in accordance with applicable law. \"Bundled\" qualified health plans are medical plans that have been certified and approved as a QHP, in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and are bundled with a stand-alone exchange-certified pediatric dental plan from Hawaii Dental Service (HDS). Information regarding dental benefits should be obtained directly from HDS.

Physicians may regard such refusal as incompatible with the continuance of a satisfactory physician-patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. Physicians use their best efforts to render all necessary and appropriate professional services in a manner compatible with a Member's wishes, insofar as this can be done consistently with the Physician's judgment regarding proper medical practice. If a Member refuses to follow a recommended treatment or procedure for a condition, and the Physician believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, the Member will be so advised. If the Member still refuses to follow the recommended treatment or procedure, then neither Medical Group, Hospitals, Health Plan nor any Physician has any further responsibility to provide any alternative treatment or procedure sought by Member for that condition. Severability If any term(s) in this EOC is found invalid under applicable law, the validity of the remaining portions of this EOC shall not be affected and the rights and duties hereunder shall be construed and enforced as if this EOC did not contain the term(s) held to be invalid.
