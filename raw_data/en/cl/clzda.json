It's an ancient practice of non-judgemental self-compassion and awareness, and meditation practices differ based on traditions. However, all forms of meditation bring awareness to the present moment, reduce stress, regulate a person's breathing, and reduce drug cravings. Whether a client engages in sitting meditation, guided meditation, or walking meditations, they learn to slow down and follow their breath. Meditation techniques often focus on breathing, non-judgemental attention to presence and awareness, and letting feelings and emotions flow through the body. Studies show a meditative state changes brain chemistry. Regulating breath through meditation also slows a person's pulse. Meditation can return the nervous system from a dysregulated and agitated state to a calm and regulated one. When the nervous system is hyperarousal, a person experiences heightened anxiety, emotional rumination, and cravings. Meditation Techniques to Fight Substance Abuse There are many types of meditation. Most meditations can help addiction recovery by calming the nervous system and reducing drug cravings. Popular meditations you can try at home include: - Mindfulness Meditation: Take several minutes to sit still with your spine upright. Close your eyes. Allow your focus to drift. Let thoughts, sensations, and feelings come and go without judgment. - Breathing Meditation: There are several types of breathing meditations. Begin with mindfulness meditation, and then bring focus to your breath. You may wish to count your breath, slowing inhaling to a count of 4. Hold your breath for a count of 2. Exhale slowing to a count of 4. Repeat as long as necessary. When thoughts distract you, return to your breath. - Movement Meditation: Walking meditations are an ancient practice. Focus on the present moment as you walk, run, or cycle. Feel your feet hitting the ground or pavement. Imagine thoughts and feelings leaving your body with each step. Walking, running, and cycling engage cross-body motion and processing, which can help the brain and body release negative emotions and past trauma. There are only a few meditation techniques to try for substance abuse treatment. Guided meditations for addiction therapy, stress management, sleep, and self-compassion are popular ways to mediate with specific directions. The more often a person meditates, the more often their body will reach a state of calm. A regulated nervous system can reduce the desire to use drugs or engage in other risk-taking behavior.
