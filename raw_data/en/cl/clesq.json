At the age of 35 I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. For the next 10 years I took my thyroid medication faithfully and yet I never felt any better. Nothing really improved. I never had enough energy, I struggled to lose weight, I had a tendency toward depression; to put it mildly I was extremely frustrated. I'd go to my doctor and tell him about my fatigue, my depression and my inability to lose weight. He'd tell me my labs looked fine; it yourself, \"What brought me here?\" Whether it's not getting answers from your doctors or the fact that you are still suffering despite taking medications or maybe you are just fed up with what conventional medicine has to offer, I am here to help you.
