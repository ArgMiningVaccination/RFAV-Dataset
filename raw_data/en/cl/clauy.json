These requirements can be waived only for medical reasons or if you are conscientiously opposed to a particular immunization. Students will not be able to attend school or receive their school class assignments/schedule until we receive one of the following: - A month-day-year record of required immunizations, signed and submitted by a parent/guardian - A signed statement from a physician or clinic stating the child has had at least one dose of each vaccine and is in the process of completing the series - A notarized statement of conscientious objection or a physician's signature stating a medical exemption to vaccination Important Health Forms and Info - Medication and Treatment Authorization Forms - Immunization Forms - Health Inventory Forms Required Immunizations - Lakeville Area Schools is one of many school districts throughout the state of Minnesota that participates in the No Shots-No School Program. This program (which follows state law [Minnesota statutes 121A.15](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/121A.15)and [Minnesota rules Part 4604.0400](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/4604.0400/)) has schools and local clinics working together to see that all students in our district are properly immunized before starting school in the fall. The program provides barrier-free access to immunizations for families without insurance and/or a family clinic. Check now with your family doctor or clinic to see if your child(ren) has all the immunizations required for their age level. If you have questions or do not have insurance, contact the nurse at your child's school for assistance. Leave a message and phone number where you can be reached and the nurse will get back to you as soon as possible. Immunization Exemption If you do not wish to have your child(ren) immunized due to medical or conscientious reasons you can pick up an exemption form at your child's school. Fill out the form, including the reason for exemption. Have the form notarized and then return it to the school your child(ren) will be attending in the fall. Immunization Clinics Dakota County offers immunization clinics for persons 18 years of age and younger. These clinics are an affordable opportunity for those families who may not have health coverage for their child's immunizations.
