I am often times shocked that with all of the evidence there is out there, that even the law makers don't stand up for their own families. The Bible says that money is the root of all evil and I believe 100% that this is the case when it comes to vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry . First of all I'd like to remind everyone that we have the right to choose in this country. Our freedoms are being stripped away as parents, more and more each day. It could just be that some of us are wise enough to make great decisions for our own families. Most of us would lay our very lives down for our families so this is not a decision that we have made hastily. People who choose not to vaccinate h ave probably spent much more time researching vaccines than most doctor spend learning about them in the classroom . Most of them haven't even bothered to read the vaccine inserts that list the possible side effects of vaccinations. In my own family we have found a genetic mutation known as MTHFR. In fact, I've learned that an estimated 60% of the population has this condition but most won't even know it. I found out that I have it when I requested the test myself from my dr. MTHFR is passed down from either the father or the mother or in some cases as in our family, both. My daughter actually has 2 of the mutations, one from me and one from her father. In our case you see, we know for a fact that we are at a much higher risk of potential vaccine injur y due to this fact. I have had two doctors warn me against flu and other vaccines due to the fact that my body will not detoxify and it would put me at greater risk of illness. If this is the case for me, what about the estimated 60% of the population that also have MTHFR or another genetic mutation that they are unaware? MTHFR, along with various other genetic mutations, makes an individual's detoxification system function less than optimally. Methylation is required to produce glutathione, which is one of the major molecules in a detoxification cycle, but if you don't methylate properly you won't be able to detoxify properly, so what this can lead to is a higher susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity and toxicity from any source like pesticides, other environmental toxins and pollutants, mold toxicity, toxicity from lipopolysaccharide or any other bacterial or pathogen -based toxin. So, in general, an increased susceptibility to toxic overload because the body is not able to detoxify properly. This making people with the MTHFR gene mutation not good candidates for vaccination. As stated previously, those with this genet ic mutation have a difficult time detoxifying heavy metals, environmental toxins and pollutants, and other bacterial or pathogen -based toxins. What do vaccinations contain? Heavy metals (mercury, aluminum) environmental toxins and pollutants (formaldehyd e, monosodium glutamate, antibiotics) and bacteria and pathogens (the diseases they are formulated to create an immune response to, among others due to contamination ) MTHFR is a gene that acts like a switch, turning various processes in the body either on or off. MTHFR or Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase takes folate and methylates it into methylfolate. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is one of the most important functions in the body. The link between MTHFR and Autism could be the most important development in Autism prevention and treatment. You see, my sister in law has 3 vaccine injured children with varying degrees of autism. Of course we know now that the MTHFR gene runs in our family. She has 10 children. She didn't vaccinate the younger children who are healthy with no signs of autism. My brother in law had 3 vaccinated children, one with autism. So you see it would be reckless for a parent with this knowledge to subject their own children in a family known to have these issues to our CDC's recommended vaccination schedule. Furthermore, I wonder why isn't MTHFR a routine part of the blood test given at birth when they are aware of this correlation. Blood is taken from every infant shortly after birth in every hospital in America. F or me, the answer is clear. They don't care. It's not about the health and welfare of our children. It's about greed. It's much more likely that we have an epidemic of vaccine injured children in this country than we have an epidemic of meningitis. Just a couple of months ago I got a message from one of my husband's cousins who's child had begun having seizures after his 4 month vaccinations. I speak today only of my personal history with vaccinations but each family has their own story and conviction regarding them. We can't take the voice away for those parents who are fighting for the health and safety of their children. "}
