She is an excellent chiropractor and doctor of homeopathy. She helped me immensely when I had gone to the \"medical doctors\" for more than a year and spent more than $8,000 but came out without a single answer to my problem. Dr. Jessica did an x-ray and determined in one visit what the problem was. She also helped treat the toxicity that I had, because of the pain and sleeping medications the \"medical doctors\" had prescribed with homeopathic modalities. She has been a great help to me. I will bypass a medical doctor anytime and always give homeopathy and chiropractic the chance to heal me. They, throughout my entire life, have always done a much better job of healing me and at a much lower cost to me.
