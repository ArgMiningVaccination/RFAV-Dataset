It has been three days since the UK Freshman Thomas \"Lofton\" Hazelwood died from \"presumed alcohol toxicity.\" The university's president Eli Capilouto, UK Vice President for Student Success Kirsten Turner imposed new guidance to keep the campus community safe including suspending activities of new members to Interfraternity Council indefinitely and requiring new training for IFC chapter members. Thursday evening the Catholic Newman Center held a formal vigil for students, faculty to pay their respects and give confessions to Father Steve Roberts. The center was filled with music, candles, attendees were greeted and comforted by a prayer team including UK sophomore Karys Whitehead, who is helping students heal and grieve. \"So I personally did not know Lofton but I do know some people that did, just to offer myself to others in this time,\" said Whitehead. \"The Lofton family grieves as we grieve, we have a God who is so moved that he weeps with us.\" said Father Steve Roberts. The prayer vigil was led by Father Roberts and student musicians. \"It has been a very quiet campus here. I think most of our students are grieving or they are confused or they do not know quite why it happened or how it happened,\" said Whitehead. The Fayette County coroner said, pending an investigation, Hazelwood most likely died from \"presumed alcohol toxicity.\" The University of Kentucky is released a statement reading for new guidance for the campus communities safety. The statement reads: \"Suspending activities of new members of the Interfraternity Council (IFC) chapters indefinitely and requiring new training for all IFC chapter members focusing on bystander intervention, and an additional course around hazing prevention and university expectations.\" \"Of course it is difficult anytime you lose someone, especially someone as young as Lofton. There is a special depth of pain and grief in someone's heart, he was such a wonderful young man,\" said Father Roberts. Hazelwood was just beginning his college career like many others inside of Newman Catholic Center \"In these times I think it is so important to trust in God's plan and trust in his will. Knowing that Lofton is in his arms now with our heavenly father up in heaven, I think that is bringing a little bit of comfort to everyone here today,\" said Whitehead. The University of Kentucky says they will continue to evaluate training programs and update its code of student conduct. "}
