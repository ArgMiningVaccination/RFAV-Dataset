Here's our pick of the best herbal health remedies designed to keep your immune system fighting fit all-year-round. Sick and tired of fighting off [cold and flu](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/coronavirus-cold-flu-symptoms)? Whether you're burning the candle at both ends, or your immune system is at an all time low, there are some simple steps you can take to give your immune system the help it needs to protect your body against nasty illness. We asked our pharmacists which [vitamins](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/collections/vitamins), supplements and herbal remedies help to boost your immune system the natural way. How does the immune system work? The immune system is a complex network of cells, chemicals, tissues and organs that constantly protects your body against pathogens, [viruses](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/is-the-covid-19-vaccine-safe), toxins and bacteria, that can potentially invade the body and make you sick. It identifies these 'invading pathogens' by triggering an immune response, with the goal of restoring your body's immunity to a normal healthy function. Many people assume that when they get sick, it's their body's way of telling them that they have a [weak immune system](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/what-is-an-autoimmune-disease). In actual fact, it's a sign that your body's immune system is fighting off the illness. It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do. Your symptoms are an 'immune response', indicating that your immune system is working hard to protect you and keep you healthy. We come into contact with germs, including [bacteria and viruses](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/coronavirus-cold-flu-symptoms) every day. A healthy immune system works hard to stop you getting sick from these germs. It recognises these harmful substances, then triggers an immune response to defend itself as soon as these germs enter the body. Your immune system firstly tries to flush the virus or infection out of the body (i.e. a cough or cold), and then tells your white blood cells to attack the foreign invaders, to prevent them from causing any further harm. So why do I seem to get ill when others don't?! A number of factors, including certain lifestyle choices, can affect your immune system. Each person's immune response differs from one person to the next \u2014 some people have a more balanced immune response, while others do not. The best way to avoid getting ill is to keep your immune system as healthy as possible. You can do this simply by making [healthy lifestyle choices](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/healthy-heart-tips) \u2014 like eating [nutritious foods](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/what-is-nutrition), getting [optimal sleep](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/why-am-i-always-tired) and [exercising](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/5-ways-to-lose-weight-fast). How do you keep your immune system healthy? You may not have much control over how your immune system functions, but there are a few things you can do to keep it balanced and working efficiently. First and foremost, try sticking to a healthy lifestyle. It's the first (and most effective) step you can take to encourage your immune system to work the way it's supposed to. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when it's protected against harmful [environmental assaults](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/seasonal-allergies-vs-perennial). Here are a few tips to keep your body and your immune system in great shape: - don't smoke - eat a heathy, balanced diet that's high in fruits and vegetables - exercise regularly - maintain a healthy weight - drink [alcohol](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/effects-of-alcohol-on-skin)in moderation - get at least 7-8 hours' sleep per night Research has proven that supplementing the body with specific vitamins, minerals, herbs and other substances may also boost immune response and potentially protect against infections and illnesses. It's important to note that these supplements may interact with any prescription or [over-the-counter medications](https://vitalpharmacysupplies.com.au/blogs/the-health-wellness-edit/practitioner-only-supplements) that you are taking. Some supplements may not be suitable for those with existing health conditions. If you're unsure, talk with your healthcare provider before you start your course.
