As [previously communicated](https://insideucr.ucr.edu/announcements/2022/01/19/submitting-proof-covid-19-booster-new-employee-health-system), all students and employees are required to be fully vaccinated, which includes receiving booster doses as stipulated in the UC [vaccine mandate](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19), or to have an approved exemption. Vaccination records for UCR employees will be stored in the new HIPAA-secure Epic electronic medical records system (also called MyChart), which is managed in partnership between UC San Diego Health and UCR Health. Please make sure to upload information about all doses including boosters. If you have not previously used MyChart, you should have received in late January an email with an activation link from [MyChart@healthmychart.org](mailto: MyChart@healthmychart.org). If you cannot find the email, please contact [COVID19@medsch.ucr.edu](mailto: COVID19@medsch.ucr.edu) for a new activation link. Only use the activation link to create your MyChart account. Do not attempt to use your Social Security number to register. If you are having trouble using MyChart, please follow the [instructions](https://studentdocs.ucr.edu/campus-return/UCR_Employee_Instructions_for_Uploading COVID19 Vaccine Information.pdf) closely. If you continue having difficulty, please contact [COVID19@medsch.ucr.edu](mailto: COVID19@medsch.ucr.edu) for assistance. After February 25, UCR will begin reviewing MyChart to verify compliance with UC vaccine policy for all employees who have not requested an exemption or deferral. Notices of Non-Compliance will be sent after that time. Thank you for doing your part to keep our campus community safe. Stay healthy. "}
