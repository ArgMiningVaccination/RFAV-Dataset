It contains extracts from germs and cancerous cells, which are the key contributors of health issues. Once formulated, the vaccine will then be injected back into the patient's body to stimulate white blood cells. This is done to create a form of immunity memory so as to prepare the body's own immune system to eliminate any foreign invaders which are the cause of these diseases. What is a Nosode? Germs, cancerous cells and toxic substances in the body are called Nosodes in homeopathy treatment. What is a Nosode Vaccine? The Nosode Vaccine is an extract from the patient's blood. The blood may contain cancerous cells or germs that may cause issues such as inflammation or allergies. The extracted blood will then be used to cultivate these germs in order to viably increase their numbers. The cultivated germs are then separated at the molecular level into small pieces of proteins using specialized innovative scientific technology from Germany. A vaccine is then created from the extract of the proteins and reintroduced back into the body. Suitable candidates - Patients or persons with cancer risks - Persons with an allergy or an autoimmune disorder such as SLE, rheumatism and ankylosing spondylitis - Patients with an immunodeficiency Suitable candidates - Patients or persons with cancer risks - Persons with an allergy or an autoimmune disorder such as SLE, rheumatism and ankylosing spondylitis - Patients with an immunodeficiency Mechanism of action The immunity theory states that due to White Blood Cell Exhaustion or T Cell Exhaustion, cancerous cells or certain germs at times cannot be efficiently eliminated from the body. The responsiveness of white blood cells is reduced by the antigens of cancerous cells and germs. This causes them to become exhausted and too weak to eliminate the cancerous cells or germs. This results in a state of habituation where the body has no more protection against these impending threats. Therefore, in order to improve the body's immune system, proteins are taken from cancerous cells, cancer-causing or allergy-causing germs extract are formulated into a vaccine which is then infused back into the body. White blood cells around the muscles will play an important role as they will consume the vaccine and pass on the recognition trigger of the vaccine to the other white blood cells. This in turn will create a pathway for the white blood cells to eliminate cancerous cells due to the same protein structure as that of the injected Nosode Vaccine. Elimination transmitter Nosode Vaccine is like a process that teaches white blood cells in the body to recognize cancerous cells and germs. The information transmitted by the vaccine helps stimulate and train the body's white blood cells to detect plus fight the cancerous cells and "}
