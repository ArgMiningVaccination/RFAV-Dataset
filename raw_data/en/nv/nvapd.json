One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime, but in any given year, only 50 percent of women ages 40-85 years old will have a mammogram. One of the main reasons women don't get their annual screening mammogram is because they are uninsured and cannot afford it. Twenty-percent of American women are uninsured, and of those, 67 percent needed medical care but did not receive it because of the cost involved. In Sevier County, 21 percent of women are uninsured. To help women in our community get the vital healthcare they need, Paint the Mountains Pink offers free mammograms to women in Sevier County who cannot afford them. Many women do not get their annual mammogram because they are unaware of how important early detection of breast cancer is. Mammograms alone find 85-90 percent of breast cancers. Mammography can detect cancer up to two years before it can be detected with a self breast exam. Emily Burdick, MD, radiologist at LeConte's breast center stated, \"At LeConte Comprehensive Breast Center we recommend that women begin getting their screening mammograms annually at age 40. This recommendation is supported by multiple healthcare agencies including the [ American College of Radiology](http://www.acr.org), the [Society of Breast Imaging](http://www.sbi-online.org) and the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists](http://www.acog.org/).\" Since Paint the Mountains Pink began providing community support in April 2013, the LeConte Comprehensive Breast Center has provided more than 280 mammograms through the program. The LeConte Comprehensive Breast Center is accredited as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology (one of only 26 in the state of Tennessee), and is pleased to offer the latest technology in breast imaging, 3D mammography. Because of this higher quality imaging, 3D mammography is beneficial for women with dense breasts. Women with dense breasts are four to six times more likely to develop breast cancer; however, for these women, cancer detection can be more challenging \u2014 especially with the limitations of traditional mammography. For more information about 3D mammography, visit www.lecontemedicalcenter.com/breastcenter, or call (865) 446-8000 today to schedule your annual mammogram appointment. How can you help?

Local television personality and cancer survivor Ken Schwall is serving as co-chair for the 2016 race along with returning co-chair Michael Holtz. They share a common passion for encouraging cancer screenings and early detection. \"Between the two of us, we've battled cancer three times. And we've been blessed to win the fight each time\" says Michael Holtz. \"We are firm believers in the power of early detection in beating cancer.\" Schwall agrees, recalling his diagnoses. \"About a dozen years ago during a routine physical, my doctor felt a swelling in my neck near my throat. She suggested I have it checked and after a couple of biopsies, I learned that I had thyroid cancer. So out came the thyroid. It was followed up by some radiation and the doctors told me that the cancer was discovered early enough that it was confined to the thyroid.\" \"Then eight or nine years ago I was having a routine physical and my PSA (prostate-specific antigen) count was high,\" Schwall continues. \"After a couple of biopsies, I learned that I had prostate cancer. My first reaction \u2014 I gotta quit having these routine physicals! But in truth, it's quite the opposite. I had surgery at Fort Sanders Regional and radiation at Thompson Cancer Survival Center. My PSA level remains very low and very slow, so we just keep an eye on it. \"Needless to say I'm a firm believer in those routine physicals, knowing how vital they are and the value of early detection.\" Both Holtz and Schwall are channeling their belief into action through the Race Against Cancer to help those who don't have easy access to early detection screenings. \"By participating in and supporting the Race, you have the power to save lives,\" says Holtz. \"Please join us in the SUBWAY\u00ae Race Against Cancer. Together, we can make a difference in the fight against cancer right here in East Tennessee.\" Thompson Cancer Survival Center is committed to the belief that every person deserves a fighting chance to defeat cancer. We gratefully acknowledge our local SUBWAY\u00ae franchisee partners, our race sponsors and our participants for joining the Center in that fight. Thank you!

Learn the Difference and How to Protect Yourself How is a cold different from the flu? A cold and the flu (influenza) are two different illnesses. A cold is relatively harmless and usually clears up by itself after a period of time, although sometimes it may lead to a secondary infection such as an ear infection. However, the flu can lead to complications such as pneumonia and even death. What may seem like a cold could, in fact, be the flu. Learn the differences in the table below. Viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs cause illnesses like the flu and colds. They're usually spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes. They also can spread when a person touches cold or flu viruses deposited from another person on a desktop, doorknob, desk, telephone receiver, or handrail. Some viruses and bacteria can live for two hours or more on hard surfaces. If the person then touches his or her eyes, mouth, or nose before washing his or her hands, the viruses or bacteria enter the body and infection can occur. |Cold Symptoms||Flu Symptoms| |Low throat||Sometimes energy level or may feel sluggish||Extreme exhaustion| Keep you and your coworkers healthy this flu season with these helpful tips: Protect Yourself Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. Keep an alcohol-based hand sanitizer on your desk or with you at all times. After coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose, wash your hands or rub sanitizer into them until they are dry. Clean your hands after using public transportation or conference room equipment. When soap and water aren't available, use alcohol-based throwaway hand wipes or gel sanitizers. For the most effectiveness, make sure the product is at least 60 percent alcohol. If using a gel, rub it into your hands until they're dry. Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands. Keep your work surface clean. Use a household disinfectant to wipe down your desk, keyboard, computer mouse, telephone, and other objects you touch often. Follow the directions on the label. If possible, do not use coworkers' offices, desks or supplies. If you need to use them, wipe them down with disinfectant first. Get the flu vaccine as soon as it is available in your area. Protect Others Keep tissues on your desk and cough or sneeze into a tissue. Stay at home if you feel sick with flu-like symptoms like a fever or chills and a cough or sore throat. Other symptoms include runny nose, headache, fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting. Contact your health care provider to find out whether you should be tested or treated for the flu. Stay at home until at least 24 hours after your temperature stays below 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher without the use of fever-reducing medicine. Some symptoms may remain. If you have a family member who has the flu but you feel well, it is safe to go to work. Check your health daily and stay home if you start to feel sick. A Simple Way to Keep the Flu Away The single best way to avoid the flu is to get a flu vaccination each season. Do I have the flu? Common symptoms of the flu include: - Headache - Fever - Runny or stuffy nose - Cough - Sore throat - Aches and pains - Fatigue How should I get the vaccine? The flu shot is approved for all people older than six months. Some adults who are at higher risk for flu because of age or compromised immune systems can request a higher-strength version of the flu vaccine. Check with your healthcare provider to see if you need this type of vaccination. Am I at high risk? Everyone 6 months of age and older should get the flu vaccine, but some people are at an even higher risk for complications from the flu: - Children 6 months to 59 months (under five years old) - Adults ages 50 and older - Anyone with a chronic disease - Anyone who lives in a nursing home or other long-term care site - Healthcare workers - People who are often in contact with elderly adults or the chronically ill - Women who plan to be pregnant during flu season Before you vaccinate Talk with your healthcare provider first if you: - Have a severe allergy \u2014 like an anaphylactic reaction \u2014 to chicken eggs - Have previously developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in the 6 weeks after getting a flu shot - Currently have an illness with a fever Children younger than 6 months of age should not be immunized against the flu. Flu vaccines haven't been approved for that age group. Wiping out myths We've all learned you can't always believe what you read (or hear!), and the same is true with the flu: Truth: Vaccinating can prevent and reduce illness and prevent time lost from work. Myth: I should wait to get vaccinated until I have symptoms of the flu. Truth: Flu viruses used in flu shots are inactivated, so they cannot cause infection. Myth: The flu shot can give me the flu. Truth: People should get a flu vaccine as soon as they're available because it takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop. Call your physician's office today to schedule your flu shot, or visit a local pharmacy chain that administers the vaccine.
