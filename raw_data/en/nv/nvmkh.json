By Dr. Jill Stanard, Natural Health Center clinic director Getting the flu is a bummer, whether it's you or your kid. It can be especially bad for people who are aging or whose health is compromised. Some people should get the flu vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that certain groups get vaccinated each year. People who are at high risk for complications of the flu, such as the elderly living in long term care facilities, people with chronic illnesses like asthma or people with immune compromised conditions should strongly consider a flu shot. Also, those who care for people in these categories should consider being vaccinated. Visit the CDC website at www.cdc.gov for detailed recommendations. Each individual or parent should talk with his or her physician to make an informed decision about vaccination. For people who are healthy and who have a good vital force (our Chinese medical friends would say, qi or chi), the flu is something that can often be fought off by the immune system, or avoided by good habits. At worst it'll put us in bed for a few days. The decision about whether to get a flu shot involves several considerations. How strong is your immune system? How well are you eating and caring for yourself? Are you able to routinely take vitamins and other supplements that will help support your immune system? The basics for flu season (November through March) are a consistent, high quality multi-vitamin, a probiotic (good gut bacteria like lactobacillis acidophilus) and an immune enhancing supplement. Echinacea works for some. Bee pollen also helps support immune function. Other good habits for avoiding the flu are hand washing, hand washing, hand washing! And stress reduction. Take a yoga class, morning walks or other physical activity. Use meditation or prayer to help calm your mind and body. Also find a good natural health care practitioner who can help you get to that place of balance and good vital force. Ask your naturopathic physician or Chinese medicine practitioner if you have questions about getting a flu shot, or would like more information on how to fire up your immune system to ward off colds and flu. Healthy Tips for Fall and Beyond Even if you're feeling fine right now, this is a good time of year to take steps to maintain health. Here are some tips from Dr. Jen Brusewitz's presentation at the September Act Naturally event at Pettygrove Clinic: Eat a low-fat breakfast with protein. Identify & treat food sensitivities to keep immunity levels high. Every day, eat the colors of the rainbow, and avoid processed foods. Eat foods that are \"nutrient dense. \" Refined sugar suppresses the immune system and raises blood sugar levels. Beware of kids' vitamins that are loaded with sugar. Avoid sugar and hard to digest foods when sick. Eat a variety of whole grains, proteins (organic, free-range, grass fed) and healthy fats. Sleep is the best healer! Sleep routine is very important. Eliminate TV time and increase moving around time! Exercise boosts immunity. Drink immune boosting teas with herbs like chamomile, mint, nettles, and Echinacea. Create a mini first aid kit with calendula succus, rescue remedy, all purpose salve, arnica gel, and preparations of Arnica 30C, Ledum 30c, and Apis 30C. Act Naturally is a continuing series of health education events featuring speakers, refreshments, and more, on the third Friday of each month at the NCNM clinics.

The words translate as \"working with the life energy. \" Qigong is practiced by millions of people every day to achieve health, balance and harmony of the body, mind and spirit In general, Qigong is a set of exercises that focuses on the coordination of three main areas: movement, breath, and intention. The practices of Qigong are very gentle and subtle and available to anyone of any age group or ability. Natural imagery is often used to assist the practitioner in centering thoughts and entering a therapeutic state of mind. The concept of balance is always foremost in any practice of Qigong, as it is through balance that lasting health is achieved. The imbalance that many people feel in their hectic daily lives demonstrates the importance of this concept. Qigong practices help to restore this balance and repair the relationship people have with themselves and the world around them. Many Qigong exercises are used to strengthen the body and heal a variety of physical ailments, and research confirms their effectiveness. Dr. Beil teaches Qigong classes at Pettygrove Clinic on Monday nights at 6 p.m. Please call 503-552-1552 or ask at the front desk for a complete schedule of classes.

Using the philosophy of \"nature cure\" as a guide, she aims to find the cause of disease, remove obstacles to wellness, and then treat her patients with nutrients, plant medicine, and hydrotherapy. After researching various alternative healing methods, Dr. Brusewitz says she was amazed by the comprehensive training naturopathic doctors receive, as well as the great variety of therapeutic options. \"The potential for profound healing drew me in!\" Dr. Brusewitz is a supervising clinician at Pettygrove Clinic specializing in womens' medicine, digestive disorders and food allergies, acute illness (such as colds and flu), chronic disease, and wellness support through nutritional counseling, stress management and lifestyle balancing.
