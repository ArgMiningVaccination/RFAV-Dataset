One of the most noteworthy of 'eradicated' diseases in the Western world - measles, has made a resurgence as a direct result of the immunisation threshold not being reached in an increasing number of countries. The decline in public confidence around the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is due to many reasons, but one significant contributing factor is the 'anti-vaccination movement' and its persistent spreading of false and misleading information on social media.
