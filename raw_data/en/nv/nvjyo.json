The Benefits of Shamanic Healing Rituals When we speak of 'rituals,' it often refers to a series of actions carried out regularly to initiate the desired result. This could be done for a variety of reasons from carrying out your morning routine which you know gets you out of the door on time to a ritual you conduct for relaxation purposes. The shamanic form of healing rituals produces empowering ways to make changes, set intentions and heal in mind, body, and spirit. This can be through amazing shamanic practices, achieving shamanic dream rituals and meditative experiences. These shamanic rituals will help you focus energies around you and give you the power to induce powerful transformational experiences to change your life for the better, this is the core of [Shamanism](https://www.meehlfoundation.org/shamanism).
