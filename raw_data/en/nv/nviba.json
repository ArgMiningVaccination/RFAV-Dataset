One of the main reasons of the great impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society is its unexpected spread, which has not allowed an adequate preparation. The scientific community is fighting against time for the production of a vaccine, but it is difficult to place a safe and effective product on the market as fast as the virus is spreading. Similarly, for drugs that can directly interfere with viral pathways, their production times are long, despite the great efforts made. For these reasons, we analyzed the possible role of non-pharmacological substances such as supplements, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in reducing the risk of Sars-CoV-2 infection or mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19. These substances could have numerous advantages in the current circumstances, are generally easily available, and have negligible side effects if administered at the already used and tested dosages. Large scientific evidence supports the benefits that some bacterial and molecular products may exert on the immune response to respiratory viruses. These could also have a regulatory role in systemic inflammation or endothelial damage, which are two crucial aspects of COVID-19. However, there are no specific data available, and rigorous clinical trials should be conducted to confirm the putative benefits of diet supplementation, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in the current pandemic.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-06-08", "cleaned_text": "Diet Supplementation, Probiotics, and Nutraceuticals Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The clinical severity spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 may range from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sometimes leading to multi organ failure (MOF). More recently, new insights concerning the disease course are emerging. Some patients are initially characterized by dyspnea and hypoxemia, which can rapidly progress to a mild respiratory syndrome needing O2 therapy. In contrast, other patients rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sometimes evolving in septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Thus, COVID-19 has emerged as a multifaceted, multi-system, multi-organ disorder which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs. Notably, all age groups are susceptible to the virus, and elderly patients with comorbidities are more likely to experience a severe illness. As of 29 May 2020, over 5,800,000 confirmed cases have caused more than 360,000 deaths [ [2](#B2-nutrients-12-01718)]. [3](#B3-nutrients-12-01718)], but only remdesivir has shown to be effective in shortening the time to recovery of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [ [4](#B4-nutrients-12-01718)]. Also, a short-term use of corticosteroids to inhibit the cytokine cascade and to prevent disease progression toward a severe form could be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [ [5](#B5-nutrients-12-01718)]. The widely used treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (often in association with macrolides) has shown mixed benefits in the available studies and may even be harmful according to some authors, due to cardiac toxicity [ [6](#B6-nutrients-12-01718), [7](#B7-nutrients-12-01718)]. Taking into account these results, the WHO firstly suspended the studies launched on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [ [8](#B8-nutrients-12-01718)]. Nevertheless, there would seem to be a need for general clarification. Indeed, since several concerns were raised with respect to data and analyses performed at the moment we are proofreading our manuscript the article was retracted and the WHO resumed the studies concerning chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In reason of a disproportionate and aberrant immune response able to drive COVID-19 to the related ARDS and, in some patients, to fibrosis and widespread lung damage, tocilizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-6-receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, is currently under investigation in several clinical trials [ [9](#B9-nutrients-12-01718)]. 2. Methods and Design 3. Probiotics [10](#B10-nutrients-12-01718)]. [11](#B11-nutrients-12-01718)]. ACE2 is highly expressed in AT2 lung cells but also in esophagus epithelial cells and enterocytes in the ileum and colon [ [12](#B12-nutrients-12-01718)]. TMPRSS2, a protein responsible for the priming of the viral S protein (necessary for entry into the host cell) is also highly expressed in absorbent enterocytes [ [13](#B13-nutrients-12-01718)]. [10](#B10-nutrients-12-01718), [14](#B14-nutrients-12-01718)]. A histological study by Fei Xiao et al. performed on the intestinal mucosa of a patient with stool positivity reported infiltrating plasma cells and lymphocytes with interstitial edema in the epithelium of stomach, duodenum, and rectum. Furthermore, the presence of the viral host receptor ACE2 was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, while the viral nucleocapsid protein was visualized in the cytoplasm of rectum, duodenal, have resulted to play an essential role in shaping the host immune systems as well as in triggering its responses in both health and disease conditions [ [22](#B22-nutrients-12-01718), [23](#B23-nutrients-12-01718)]. The presence of an intimate relationship between the host immune system and the microbiota has been primarily evidenced in the gastrointestinal tract by the determination, in germ-free mice, of many immunological defects such as small Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, reduced amount of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and deficiency in regulatory T cells [ [24](#B24-nutrients-12-01718)]. These defects reverse, within weeks, after the acquisition of intestinal bacteria from normally colonized mice [ [25](#B25-nutrients-12-01718)]. Further evidence has shown that the gastrointestinal tract microbiota is able to modulate neutrophils migration and function [ [26](#B26-nutrients-12-01718)] as well as to influence the differentiation of T cells into Th1, Th2, Th17 helper cells, or T regulatory (Treg) cells [ [27](#B27-nutrients-12-01718)], which may be linked in turn to tolerance or immune reactions against different luminal bacteria. Compared to the study of the intestinal microbiota, that of the lung microbiota is still at the beginning, but some observations support the role played by commensal bacteria in the lung in immune tolerance maintained by subpopulations of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells [ [28](#B28-nutrients-12-01718)]. Such cell types, by inducing the generation of Tregs [ [29](#B29-nutrients-12-01718)] and releasing prostaglandin E2 immunomodulatory while the introduction of commensal bacteria in germ-free mice has been shown to reduce the strong immune response induced by the intranasal administration of ovalbumin (OVA) [ [31](#B31-nutrients-12-01718)]. In human lungs, bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes have been associated with the decrease of lung inflammation [ [32](#B32-nutrients-12-01718)], while the bacterial genera Prevotella and Veillonella have been implicated in Th17 cell-mediated immune responses [ [33](#B33-nutrients-12-01718)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-12-01718)]. To date, a wide range of local and systemic diseases, comprising inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, allergic disorders, atopic dermatitis, autism, colorectal cancer, and diseases affecting both the higher and the lower respiratory tracts, have been associated with microbial dysbiosis [ [35](#B35-nutrients-12-01718), [36](#B36-nutrients-12-01718), [37](#B37-nutrients-12-01718), [38](#B38-nutrients-12-01718), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-01718)]. In particular, in recent years, the interaction between the intestine and the respiratory system, both for homeostasis maintenance and in disease pathways, has been individuated, and the term \"gut-lung axis\" was coined to refer to this mutual interaction [ [40](#B40-nutrients-12-01718)]. [41](#B41-nutrients-12-01718), [42](#B42-nutrients-12-01718), [43](#B43-nutrients-12-01718), [44](#B44-nutrients-12-01718), [45](#B45-nutrients-12-01718)]. Consensus has been reached that viral infections, including those sustained by influenza viruses, alter the commensal microbiota in both the gastrointestinal and the airway tracts of the host, causing alterations of the microbiota-host relationship, which is a key element in determining infection-related disease. Different studies have evidenced that, in the upper respiratory tract, the influenza virus infection is associated with decreased colonization by health-promoting bacteria as well as with enrichment in potentially harmful microbes. For example, it has been reported that the nasopharyngeal microbiota of patients with viral respiratory tract infections is significantly enriched in bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and catarrhalis, while the colonization of the health-associated genus Prevotella results to be decreased [ [46](#B46-nutrients-12-01718), [47](#B47-nutrients-12-01718)]. Although contradictory findings are reported in the current literature for the gut microbiota, resulting from differences in experimental conditions, concerning virus subtypes and doses, experimental animal models, age, diet, and lifestyle of the investigated subjects, a general decrease in the richness of bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, mainly Lactobacilli, has been associated with viral infections and, in particular, with influenza viruses [ [48](#B48-nutrients-12-01718), [49](#B49-nutrients-12-01718), [50](#B50-nutrients-12-01718)]. One of the postulated mechanisms leading to commensal microbiota dysregulation involves the altered delivery of IFN- (a type II IFN) by a subset of lung-derived T cells expressing CC chemokine receptor 9 in the intestine and the subsequent stimulation of epithelial cells to produce IL-15, which induces a Th17-mediated immune response [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-01718)]. Although no direct evidence is currently available about the association between SARS-CoV-2 infections and microbial dysbiosis in both the gut and the respiratory tract, the presence of symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort, as well as the determined tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for enterocytes [ [14](#B14-nutrients-12-01718), [15](#B15-nutrients-12-01718), [52](#B52-nutrients-12-01718)], suggests that interactions between this new -coronavirus and the gut microbiota are possible. [53](#B53-nutrients-12-01718)]. Although solid evidence is still lacking, many experimental and clinical studies support the possible role of different probiotic microorganisms in protecting the host against viral infections, comprising those responsible for colds and flu [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-01718), [55](#B55-nutrients-12-01718), [56](#B56-nutrients-12-01718), [57](#B57-nutrients-12-01718), [58](#B58-nutrients-12-01718), [59](#B59-nutrients-12-01718)]. [60](#B60-nutrients-12-01718)]. [61](#B61-nutrients-12-01718)]. An inhibiting mechanism involving a direct interaction between bacterial cell wall components and herpes simplex virus type 2 has been also suggested for Lactobacillus brevis CD2 strain [ [62](#B62-nutrients-12-01718)]. Furthermore, exopolysaccharides from Lactobacillus species were demonstrated to completely suppress the production of adenovirus-5 in vitro [ [63](#B63-nutrients-12-01718)]. [63](#B63-nutrients-12-01718), [64](#B64-nutrients-12-01718), [65](#B65-nutrients-12-01718), [66](#B66-nutrients-12-01718), [67](#B67-nutrients-12-01718)]. Oral administration of L. brevis in mice protected the animals from influenza infection through the enhancement of antiviral IFN- as well as an augmented production of specific-IgA antibodies against the virus [ [68](#B68-nutrients-12-01718)]. L. plantarum significantly reduced the titers of human H1N1 and avian influenza H7N9 viruses in mouse lungs after a lethal viral challenge and increased the mean number of days and rates of survival of the infected mice [ [69](#B69-nutrients-12-01718)]. [70](#B70-nutrients-12-01718)]. In addition, L. paracasei-fed mice showed a lower incidence of influenza A H3N2 infection, associated with a reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs and a faster virus elimination [ [71](#B71-nutrients-12-01718)]. Bacteria belonging to the Bifidobacteria group exert protective effects against influenza virus infection. After lethal influenza A (H1N1) infection, a strong stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity, associated with lower levels of proinflammatory IL-6 production and an increase in survival rate of mice receiving Bifidobacterium bifidum, with respect to the control group, was observed [ [72](#B72-nutrients-12-01718)]. Another important preventive action of probiotics against the progression of viral infections could be mediated by the enhancement of the mucosal intestinal barrier that in turn may prevent virus spreading in the sub-mucosal compartment and in the systemic circulation. A multi-strain probiotic mixture has demonstrated a preventive effect on intestinal inflammation onset in a mouse model of spontaneous ileitis, mediated by the stimulation of TNF release from epithelial cells and decreased permeability [ [73](#B73-nutrients-12-01718), [74](#B74-nutrients-12-01718)]. L. rhamnosus GG has shown a beneficial effect in the treatment of infections by enhancing intestinal permeability, with the stimulation of mucin expression and the regulation of proliferation/apoptosis of epithelial cells, both in experimental models and in clinical studies [ [75](#B75-nutrients-12-01718), [76](#B76-nutrients-12-01718)]. [77](#B77-nutrients-12-01718)]. A reduction of virus-induced inflammation was also exerted by a strain of L. plantarum in mice after acute infection by pneumonia virus (PMV), a rodent pathogen that induces inflammation and is related to the respiratory syncytial virus [ [78](#B78-nutrients-12-01718)]. Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis Bl-04, in an experimental rhinovirus infection, showed to reduce the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, as well as to reduce the nasal lavage virus titer [ [79](#B79-nutrients-12-01718)]. Similarly, the administration of this probiotic in the respiratory tract of mice infected with PVM, increased mice survival and reduced the levels of IL-6, whose suppression was demonstrated to be a critical feature of the protective mechanism. It was recently reported that COVID-19, similarly to SARS-CoV, is characterized by a dramatic inflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm associated with increased disease severity [ [80](#B80-nutrients-12-01718), [81](#B81-nutrients-12-01718)]. Patients needing intensive care present higher plasma levels of many cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, IP-10, [82](#B82-nutrients-12-01718)] with respect to non- intensive care unit (ICU) subjects, suggesting the likely involvement of a highly pro-inflammatory condition in the disease progression and severity. Furthermore, a large infiltration of inflammatory cells has been observed in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients [ [83](#B83-nutrients-12-01718), [84](#B84-nutrients-12-01718)]. These aberrant pathogenic cells, together with inflammatory monocytes, may reach the lungs, causing an immune injury with consequent respiratory disability and increased mortality. The modulation of the cytokine cascade exerted by probiotics may represent a therapeutic approach for severe infections, making it licit to hypothesize that probiotics administration could influence the immune response in patients affected by COVID-19, thus preventing or mitigating the exacerbated inflammatory processes that lead to death. [85](#B85-nutrients-12-01718)]. In particular, probiotic supplementation was suggested as a complementary treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and to reduce the risk of secondary infections due to microbial translocation in severe COVID-19 cases [ [86](#B86-nutrients-12-01718)]. Despite the fact that direct evidence of the possible effect of probiotics on SARS-CoV-2 infection is not available [ [87](#B87-nutrients-12-01718)], a number of suggestions indicate that this resource could represent a complementary tool to decrease SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation and favor the recovery of intestinal mucosa damage by modulating the gut microbiota. In fact, recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces an acute intestinal inflammatory response via ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2, characterized and T-cells. [ [88](#B88-nutrients-12-01718)]. For these reasons, probiotic use could have a beneficial role in patients with COVID-related gastro-intestinal symptoms and in those with mild-moderate systemic symptoms without respiratory impairment and help prevent disease progression. As speculated, it is possible that probiotics may play a role in preventing the cytokine storm and related ARDS or MOF in high-risk individuals with established SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the opposite may also be true, and the lack of sufficient available evidence should be considered. Similarly, in patients with severe disease and in critically ill patients, probiotic administration needs to be cautiously evaluated, and important safety concerns need to be considered when administering bacterial supplements [ [89](#B89-nutrients-12-01718)]. In fact, it is not known whether the administration of micro-organisms to patients with critical disease conditions could lead to any type of injury, such as an exacerbation of inflammation. A final possible setting is disease prevention, especially for high-risk patients (immunosuppressed and elderly patients with comorbidities), \"strategic\" people (i.e., health care professionals, workers with extensive public contact), or subjects with suspected COVID-19 waiting for a clear diagnosis and/or who came in contact with a COVID-19-positive subject. The rationale for the possible prophylactic use of probiotics in SARS-CoV2 infection is linked to its ability to preserve a healthy status in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) as well as eubiosis, which is necessary to actively fight the entry of the virus into gut cells [ [90](#B90-nutrients-12-01718)]. The enhancement of the innate defenses may be probably useful in COVID-19 prevention or in the very early phase of the infection. However, it is not known whether the administration of various types of microorganisms to healthy individuals can increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Large clinical trials are needed to elucidate these hot topics and identify the most useful and safe setting for probiotics administration. Actually, three registered trials to evaluate probiotics administration to COVID-19 patients are Nutraceuticals [94](#B94-nutrients-12-01718)]. patients disclose an ongoing pro-thrombotic state, as suggested by increased plasma levels of F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation, and lower levels of protein C (PC) and activated PC (aPC) [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-01718), [95](#B95-nutrients-12-01718)]. [80](#B80-nutrients-12-01718)]. These changes correspond to the characteristics of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in which IL-6 contributes to many of the key symptoms. The role of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients has been highlighted in a recent retrospective multicenter study [ [97](#B97-nutrients-12-01718)] showing that circulating IL-6 levels were higher in COVID-19 deceased patients compared to discharged subjects. These results suggest that the \"cytokine storm syndrome\", activated by the virus could be a clinical predictor of fatal outcome in these patients. The activation of endothelial cells and the ensuing vascular dysfunction are other typical features of severe CRS. Indeed, typical markers of endothelial activation are often elevated in the serum of patients with CRS. This indicates that the endothelium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of CRS, both by amplifying the inflammatory response and by contributing to clotting and eventually to a thrombotic disease, both in the venous and in the arterial circulations [ [98](#B98-nutrients-12-01718)]. [99](#B99-nutrients-12-01718)]. [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-01718-f002)) [100](#B100-nutrients-12-01718)]. Moreover, the protective effect of polyphenols includes the reduction of oxidative stress resulting from the downregulation of NADPH oxidase or from an antiplatelet and anticoagulant function, as indicated by the reduction of platelet aggregation and the suppression of the activity of thrombin and the production of factor Xa [ [101](#B101-nutrients-12-01718), [102](#B102-nutrients-12-01718)]. Moreover, flavonoids could increase oxide and decrease superoxide production [ [103](#B103-nutrients-12-01718)] and might enhance the endothelial synthesis of NO, induce NO-dependent relaxation in isolated arteries, and activate NO signaling pathways in endothelial cells, thus improving the endothelial function. Finally, some polyphenols exert anti-inflammatory activities by modulating cytokine production and by promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes [ [104](#B104-nutrients-12-01718)], and an antiviral effect that has been already reported against several viruses [ [105](#B105-nutrients-12-01718)]. [106](#B106-nutrients-12-01718)]. They demonstrated that curcumin could bind to the target receptors of SARS-CoV-2, supporting the use of this molecule for preventive or prophylaxis treatments of virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a combination of three (phyto-) nutrients such as vitamin C, curcumin, and glycyrrhizic acid promotes interferons production and regulates the inflammatory response, suggesting that the combination of these molecules may be helpful in regulating the immune response to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [ [107](#B107-nutrients-12-01718)]. [108](#B108-nutrients-12-01718)], and they found that LH is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and markedly reduce the mRNA levels cytokines including TNF-, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1, and CXCL-10/IP-10). [109](#B109-nutrients-12-01718)]. The rationale of their use is related to the demonstrated presence of TNF in the serum and in some tissues of COVID-19 patients, where it promotes a phlogistic response [ [110](#B110-nutrients-12-01718)]. For several inflammatory diseases, anti-TNF therapies are approved by the FDA and commonly used (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis). Studies on rheumatoid arthritis have shown that blocking TNF stops the cytokine cascade, decreasing the levels of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involved pathways of augmented vascular permeability [ [111](#B111-nutrients-12-01718), [112](#B112-nutrients-12-01718)]. Also, some preclinical studies on RSV and influenza virus in mice suggest a positive response to anti-TNF therapies [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-01718)]. Some authors suggested that infliximab or adalimumab administration could be preferentially destinated to COVID-19 patients with moderate disease but at high risk to develop a severe and advanced illness [ [109](#B109-nutrients-12-01718), [114](#B114-nutrients-12-01718)]. Actually, a single registered RCT evaluating adalimumab for COVID-19 treatment is in progress (ChiCTR2000030089). Main nutraceuticals and supplements with potential role in countering COVID-19 are listed in [Table 2](#nutrients-12-01718-t002). 5. Supplementation 5.1. Vitamin C [115](#B115-nutrients-12-01718)]. Vitamin C has crucial roles in the improvement of phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and production of ROS, decreasing necrosis and tissue damage [ [116](#B116-nutrients-12-01718)]. [117](#B117-nutrients-12-01718)]. [118](#B118-nutrients-12-01718), [119](#B119-nutrients-12-01718)]. [120](#B120-nutrients-12-01718), [121](#B121-nutrients-12-01718)]. On the other hand, randomized trials demonstrated that supplementation of vitamin C has positive effects on symptoms and on the duration of respiratory tract infections. Additionally, several data suggest that vitamin C can prevent pneumonia and improve its outcome, as well as other infections [ [122](#B122-nutrients-12-01718), [123](#B123-nutrients-12-01718), [124](#B124-nutrients-12-01718), [125](#B125-nutrients-12-01718)]. [126](#B126-nutrients-12-01718), [127](#B127-nutrients-12-01718)]. Studies on lung injury induced by sepsis showed that vitamin C reduces the proinflammatory and procoagulant changes that lead to lung damage [ [126](#B126-nutrients-12-01718)]. Moreover, during infection, vitamin C levels can decrease; therefore, high doses of intravenous Vitamin C administration are required in severe cases, in order to compensate for the high turnover of the vitamin [ [128](#B128-nutrients-12-01718)]. [129](#B129-nutrients-12-01718)]. A retrospective before-after clinical study showed that a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine prevented organ dysfunction and reduced the mortality rate in patients with sepsis [ [130](#B130-nutrients-12-01718)]. Treatment with the same combination was associated with significantly lower mortality in patients with severe pneumonia and significantly improved their radiologic chest findings [ [131](#B131-nutrients-12-01718)]. Vitamin C and corticosteroids play in a synergistic way: vitamin C restores glucocorticoid receptor function, and corticosteroids increase the expression of sodium-vitamin C transporter-2 [ [132](#B132-nutrients-12-01718), [133](#B133-nutrients-12-01718)] Moreover, an experimental study showed that vitamin C and hydrocortisone administered together preserved endothelial integrity [ [134](#B134-nutrients-12-01718)]. In a recent randomized trial, evaluating patients with sepsis and ARDS, a beneficial effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin C on mortality has been suggested, although no improvement of organ dysfunction scores or change in markers of inflammation and vascular injury were observed [ [135](#B135-nutrients-12-01718), [136](#B136-nutrients-12-01718), [137](#B137-nutrients-12-01718)]. Moreover, recently, a new clinical trial to investigate the effects of vitamin C infusion for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia has started [ [138](#B138-nutrients-12-01718)]. In fact, in the absence of a specific therapy for COVID-19, vitamin C may have effects on this severe viral respiratory tract infection [ [139](#B139-nutrients-12-01718)]. Moreover, vitamin C increased the resistance to coronavirus and may affect the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions [ [117](#B117-nutrients-12-01718), [139](#B139-nutrients-12-01718), [140](#B140-nutrients-12-01718), [141](#B141-nutrients-12-01718)]. 5.2. Vitamin D [142](#B142-nutrients-12-01718)]. The receptor for vitamin D is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells and in macrophages of the respiratory system; furthermore, the 25- hydrolase, which converts vitamin D into its active metabolite, is constitutively expressed in the respiratory epithelium [ [143](#B143-nutrients-12-01718)]. The in vitro study of Philip et al. showed that in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, macrophagic production of catelicidine (like LL-37) is increased. By binding the envelope of influenza A and respiratory syncytial viruses, catelicidins are capable to damage its structure and prevent infection of human cells [ [144](#B144-nutrients-12-01718)]. [145](#B145-nutrients-12-01718), [146](#B146-nutrients-12-01718)]. [147](#B147-nutrients-12-01718)]. [148](#B148-nutrients-12-01718)]. [149](#B149-nutrients-12-01718)]. 6.
