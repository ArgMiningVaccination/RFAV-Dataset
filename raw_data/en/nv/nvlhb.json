First, for those new to Ayurveda, an introduction to the science of life. Yoga' s sister science, Ayurveda emphasizes natural means - food, lifestyle and supplements - as the way to greater health. It doesn't ignore modern medicine, but is a form of complementary and alternative health care that works really well with yoga to pro- mote wellness throughout the seasons of our life, and has shown great results with persistent issues like weight gain and skin care. Wellness Journey I've done yoga for 12 years and used Ayurveda for 8 and have seen a marked improvement in my health, digestion, weight but more than anything, in my sense of ease and well-being. I wanted to share some of the tips that I found really useful in my personal journey to wellness, that spanned the length of the globe, from T ennes- see to California, to India, Nepal and back to North Carolina.The art and science of tuning the body into balance, Ayurveda harnesses the natural intelligence of the body to bring people into optimal health. Eective for centuries, this sister science of yoga is increasing in popularity - and we couldn't be happier!Intro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 3 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa It was a journey that led me to panchakarma, a 6 day residential program based on a spe- cific diet, lots of therapeutic treatments, lifestyle changes and herbs. In just 5 days, I lost weight, felt better, improved my digestion, and saw a complete shift in my overall health, allowing me to stay fit much more easily . When I combined this with a daily practice of yoga and Art of Living' s breathing and meditation techniques, my health and happiness soared. America's Health Revisited Here I wanted to share some tips with you related to weight loss from a set of conversa- tion I had with one of India' s prominent Ayurvedic experts and trainers, who has worked with thousands and thousands of people (ever since my first, great experience with Ayurveda, I have visited many Ayurveda practitioners for preventive health). He asked me what concerns Ameri- cans the most, and I gave a long list of concerns of my friends, family and neighbors. Weight loss Back pain Managing cholesterol Diabetes management Stress Addiction It' s rare to find a family not touched by one of the above. I realized that as a society with very ad- vanced medical research, we still had a way to go in bringing wellness and a lifestyle of wellness to the general public. He offered tips that have helped many people to manage these issues, especially weight loss, which I'll share today. They are tips that I have tried, incorporated into my lifestyle and shared with my friends too. They are time-tested. And above all, you can test them and compare the re- sults first-hand. That is the only test, when all is said and done, is it not? So I invite you to research and try this for yourself. If you are committed to a one week effort, you can also leap ahead to our intensive 5-day Ayurveda detox.WEIGHT LOSS TIPSIntro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 5 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa LIFESTYLE OF HEALTH Massage: Oiling Up to Slim Down According to Ayurveda, regular massage with oil can help bring down your weight or in certain cases help a thin person to gain increase weight. For weight management, it' s a great tool.For our purposes, self-massage with oils is one of the main ways to ground ourselves and reduce fat. For losing weight, Ayurveda recommends a brief body-massage with a very particu- lar oil. Oils have various properties, some heating and some cooling, so choosing the right oil is important. Sesame oil is recommended in cases where people want to lose weight. Massaging oil all over the body for five to ten minutes is enough. We also cover how to give yourself a great foot massage with the right oil in a video in the Ayurveda Detox Guide online. THE RIGHT FOOD Food: Finding the Right Balance Ayurveda emphasizes getting into balance just by having the right amount of food and the right type of food at the right times. We'll break this down a little. Generally , the right amount is what fits comfortably in our cupped hands. We can wrap our hands around the space between the see the right amount for us. Obviously, Little John and Big Mike will have different hand sizes and probably different stomach capacities. I invite you to try it out and see if you feel more com- fortable after eating the Ayurvedic way for a couple of meals.Intro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 6 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa The Right Moment It' s recommended to eat according to time of day . When the sun is at its highest, around lunch time, the stomach is more able to digest and assimilate food. So we make lunch into our heaviest meal, when the digestive system can best support us. For our routine focused on man- aging our weight, our expert recommends a menu, which in its broad outline, is quite similar to French traditions - a light breakfast, a large lunch and a light supper. The Menu Be Fruitful Breakfast Have a light breakfast of fruits. You can soak almonds too for protein. Large Lunch You can enjoy a hearty lunch that includes significant protein. Lunch can be followed by a cup or two of buttermilk. Dinner-lite My friend had been encouraging me for years to enjoy the French tradition of the light evening supper. Ayurvedically speaking, it makes sense and allows you to digest your light meal well before sleeping. For dinner, let' s enjoy a light meal, perhaps just soup. Natural Nightcap Have a light breakfast of fruits. You can soak almonds too for protein. The Right Food For weight-loss, Ayurveda also recommends cutting back on foods that are: Salty Sour Sweet Oily & Fried These are foods to avoid in order to feel less heavy and lethargic.Intro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 7 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa So... What do I eat!? Is that your question? You are covered. More fresh fruits and vegetables will do wonders for the system. And if your energy does dip, we have in store just for you a special pick- me up drink I love. The Drink: \"Pick Me Up Sweetie\" & the Secret of Aged Honey Two or three times a day , if you drink this refreshing, simple drink, it will pick you right up. Mix: 8 - 12 oz Lukewarm water 1 Tbsp of aged honey Few drops of lemon juiceIntro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 8 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa Aged Honey The water should not be too hot because overheated honey can create toxicity in the body and difficulty in digestion. The honey should be aged at least one year, rather than fresh. The aging process adds the weight-reducing aspect. Fresh honey, however, can lead to weight gain. The best way to find out the age of honey is to ask your local honey farmer or check the expiration date on the bottle. This will give you lots of energy , so that you may not even feel like eating so much. Then, when you really feel hungry , enjoy. With this plan, you should not lose energy . Rather, you should feel lighter and have more energy, dynamism and clarity . I am feeling clear as I write this. I just enjoyed a glass. Go on, make one now if you want to. I'll wait. Healthy Herbs In addition to the above, a few herbal supplements can help you trim down too. The herb Shilajit is used in Ayurveda to balance the system. Triphala is a combination of three fruit powders that, when taken nightly with warm water, combines with your diet to cleanse and purify your system of excess baggage. You can find these herbs in health food stores or online. Summing it Up A diet that contains the right amount and the right types of foods, eaten at the right time, with gaps in between meals can help you feel fresh and lighter and lose those winter pounds. A light breakfast of fresh fruits, a hearty lunch and a light supper, along with the naturally sweet power drink will fit the bill. Some self-massage also helps to ground the body , along with herbs that support the process. Some yoga and exercise will also add to your experience. The results speak for themselves though and only you can get the results you seek. Going Deeper: Next Steps I have tried all the above recommended by our Ayurveda expert and found great results. When I wanted to go deeper, I asked the expert for a plan and he introduced me to the 5 Day Ayurveda Detox, a powerful plan that shows quick results through deep cleansing and can launch your ef- forts. I enrolled ten of my friends (the first time - I've done it three times) and we had a great time with high energy , restoration and weight loss. With this plan, in just five days many people have experienced significant transformations in how they feel and react to the world.Intro to Ayurveda Weight Loss | 9 www.artoflivingretreatcenter.orgShankara Ayurveda Spa DETOX Detox is not just a new fad, but an ancient method of purification. One contributing factor to weight issues is the accumulation of toxins in the body . This accumulation of toxins prevents us from being able to lose weight easily . While you may not put on weight, you may not be able to lose weight easily at the same time. Our Ayurveda detoxes reverses this trend so that it' s easier to lose weight by removing the blocks that stands in the way , obstructing our efforts. What are the signs of toxins in the body? One sign is that the body feels puffy , especially when you wake up in the morning. Other indications are when the body feels dull, lethargic or low energy . As Dr. Suhas Kshirsagar explains, \"Knowingly and unknowingly we collect impurities in our system - sometimes we don't digest food completely; sometimes we are consuming impurities embedded in the air, water, foods, cosmetics, etc. and they get into our system and get lodged into our cells and tissues and we call it 'amma.'\" If you want to cleanse and purify and remove the blocks to losing weight, I invite you to find out more and experience a gentle, thorough Ayurveda cleanse first-hand. One such cleanse can be done at home with our Ayurveda Detox Guide. Try the Cleanse If you I sincerely hope that you enjoyed this book. This valuable information has a lot of potential for transforming the way we feel and live. I invite you to incorporate some tips into your schedule and to let us know what works for you.
