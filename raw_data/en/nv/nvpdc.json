SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls INTRODUCTION The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disea se (COVID-19),iswreakinghavocduetowidespreaddisseminati on throughout the world. On 11 March 2020, WHO formally declared that a global pandemic and by the end of August 2020, almost 25 million cases and over 800,000 deaths had been reported worldwide involving all continents, except Antarctica ( 1). Strategies to identify cases and limit spread by widespreadtestingandphysicaldistancinghavebeenchallen ging to implement, healthcare and public health systems have been overwhelmed, resulting in continued escalation in man y countries and profound eects on lives and livelihoods. While the majority of people are either asymptomatic or experience a mild respiratory infection, 20% of cases are more severe and require hospital admission ( 2). Reported mortality rates vary by geographic region, ranging from almost 20% in France to <1% in many other countries ( 3). This wide discrepancy suggests selection bias due to dierences in local testing strategies and capacity, consistent with dierences in health system capacit y, populationdemographicsandotherhealthdeterminants.Certa in groupssuchastheelderlyandthosewithparticularcomorbidi ties are more likely to die of COVID-19 ( 3).

The urgent need for eective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines cannot be overstated.

The race to develop safe and eective vaccines has seen SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines developed at a scale and pace never imagined before: currently almost 200 potential vacci nes are in various stages of development ( 6-8). A range of vaccine designapproachesandplatformshavebeenemployed.However, since>95% of candidate vaccines typically fail it is expected that the eventual number of successful vaccines may be only be a handful. They may also become available in dierent time frames and suitable for use in dierent populations. Most vaccine candidates are currently in preclinical trials, bu t a number have entered phase 1 or phase 1/2 studies, with plans to rapidly scale up to phase 2 and 3. Trials are being conductedat\"pandemicspeed\"( 8)andusingnoveldesigns.This early success has already seen cooperation and collaboration as well as signicant funding across the globe. For example, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a not - for-prot global coalition launched in 2017 to deal with the worldwide threatof epidemic outbreaks, is playinga pivotal role insupportingmanyofthefrontrunnervaccines( 9). Herein,wereviewwhatiscurrentlyknownabouttheimmune responsetoSARS-CoV-2andthevariousvaccineplatformsbeing used to develop the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Understanding the mechanismofactionofthevariouscandidatevaccinesisthe key focus of this review. We also discuss potential challenges at t he immunological level, assessment of vaccine safety and scal e-up anddelivery. SARS-CoV-2 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION Coronavirusesareenvelopedpositive-sensesinglestrandedRNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. They infect birds and mammals causing a range of symptoms from respiratory to gastrointestinal disease ( 10). A number of relatively common seasonal coronaviruses are known to infect humans ( 11), causing mild respiratory illness (\"the common cold\"). Two previouslethalhumancoronavirusdiseases,namelysevereacu te respiratory syndrome (SARS caused by SARS-CoV-1) ( 12) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS caused by MERS- CoV) (7) arose in 2002 and 2012, respectively. They have a high mortality rate of 9 and 40%, respectively, but fortunately, neither reached pandemic levels. SARS-CoV-1 was able to be containedbypublichealthmeasurestopreventhuman-tohuman transmission and then disappeared before vaccine development hadprogressedsignicantly. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as a number of accessory and non-structural proteins ( Figure1) (13). The M and N proteins give the virion its shape, and the S proteins appear as spikes on the viral surface giving it a solar corona appearance. The S glycoprotein (spike) exists in trimeric form and is the struct ure by which binding to the host cells occurs. The virus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on the Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls FIGURE 1 | Structure of SARS-CoV-2 and key antigenic components. Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 which is a single stranded RNA vir us. The key antigenic components being targeted in vaccine design are s hown on the right, consisting of the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The main emphasis for human vaccines is based on th e spike (S) protein, consisting of an S1 binding region and S2 fusion and cell entry region. The S1 domain contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) res ponsible for binding to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of host cells. Fol lowing fusion, the S protein sheds the S1 region and undergoes a dramatic struct ural change to its post-fusional state in order for the virus to enter the ho st cells. surface of multiple human cells is engaged via the receptor binding domain (RBD), which is part of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein ( 14) (Figure1). The subunit consists of two heptad repeat fusion regions, HR1 and HR2, responsible for membrane fusion and cell entry. The RBD domain can either be down and buried or rotated up and primed for ACE2 binding (15). The hidden down state is the predominant state of the S protein trimer in SARS-CoV-2, and likely a mechanism the virus uses tohidetheentryepitopes andevadethehost immune response ( 16). Two S trimers can concurrently bind to an ACE2 dimer. Following S protein binding in its prefusion state, the S1 subunit is cleaved and shed permitting the S2 dramatic conformational changes which constitute the post-fusion st ate requiredforviralentry( 17,18). IMMUNE RESPONSE TO SARS-CoV-2 Innate Immunity to COVID-19: Protection or Hyper-Activation? SARS-CoV-2 stimulates an innate immune response via pattern associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by the virus, which in the case of SARS-CoV-2 consists of viral RNA and its intermediates produced during replication ( 19). These conservedPAMPsstimulatemultipleimmuneresponsepathways via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including sensing by endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 1 (RIG-1) and melanoma dierentiation- associated protein 5 (MDA5). Local tissue damage in the lungsalso releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) further contributing to local inflammation. The resultant inflammatory response provides immediate antiviral immunity viaactivationofantiviraltype1and3interferon(IFN)pathw ays leading to an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1 , further recruiting neutrophils, other and stimulating anti-SARS-CoV-2 adaptivememoryTcellsandBcells( 20)(Figure2). Thereisstillmuchtounderstandabouttheimmuneresponse toSARS-CoV-2andtheimmunologicaldierencesinthosewith mild as compared to severe infection. Emerging data suggest that the innate response to SARS-CoV-2 is aberrant ( 21,22). For example, the early type I and III interferon responses are relatively suppressed by SARS-CoV-2, an immune evasion strategyemployedbythevirus,leadingtoearlyfailuretoco ntrol thevirus.Furthermore,uncontrolledlocalinflammation,o rwhat hasbeendescribedas\"cytokinestorm,\"leadingtotissueda mage with inflammatory cell inltration and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is thought to characterize late sta ge, severe manifestations of COVID-19 ( 23-25). For example, patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of IL-6, IL-2 R, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ) than those with moderate disease, the former of which correlated with clinic al severity and death ( 26,27). the non-ICU COVID-19 patients, all supporting enhanced innate immunity in the sicker patients ( 28). Of note, the IL-6 levels described in COVID-19 patients are a log-fold lower than those described in classic cytokine stor m (29). Furthermore, IL-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine suggesting dysregulated immune homeostasis rather than pur e inflammation.Upregulatedchemoattractantchemokinesfurth er recruit inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophag es, natural killer (NK) cells and T cells in further immunopathology( 21)(Figure2). Induction of SARS-CoV-2 Specic Neutralizing Antibodies Antibodies (Abs) produced by activated B cells play a key role in anti-viral immunity via several mechanisms includi ng viral (ADCA) (Figure3). It is thought that generation of high levels of neutralizingantibodies(nAbs)againstSARS-CoV-2arerequ ired for a successful human vaccine ( 18). However, some patients recover without producing high levels of nAbs and those with severe disease may experience an early rise in nAbs ( 30). Nevertheless, most vaccine eorts are focused on the inducti on of nAbs to the S protein in order to block attachment of RBD to the ACE2 receptor on host cells ( 31). As mentioned before, this domain is hidden in the S protein's prefusion state, presenting challenges to the success of RBD-based vaccines ( 16). For this Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls FIGURE 2 | Key components of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as monocytes, macrop hages, and dendritic cells (DCs), recognize pattern associated molecular patterns (P AMPs) expressed by SARS-CoV-2 via their pattern recognitio n receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 7. This activates intracellular signaling pathw ays leading to the expression of type 1 and 3 interferons (IFNs ), which in turn activate innate immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This lea ds to an influx and activation of neutrophils, further APCs and other innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells. reason, some groups have focused on eliciting nAbs to the less immunogenic S2 subunit of the spike protein ( 16) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on other antigens, including the N protein,arealsobeingdeveloped. A recent report from the US describes outcomes among 35,322 COVID-19 patients, many of whom had critical illness, transfused with the plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 (convalescent plasma [CP]) ( 32). Early CP infusion within 3 days of illness had a lower 7-day mortality than those treated after 4 or more days (8.7% vs. 11.9%). In this uncontrolled study, those who received higher levels o f IgG Abs in the transfused plasma had a better mortality outcome. These data, alongside results from another uncontrolled st udy showing recovery in severely unwell COVID-19 patients treat ed with CP, lends support to the notion that naturally acquired Abs can be protective ( 33). However, other plasma factors such as cytokines, defensins and other non-specic Abs may also play a protective role in these studies ( 34). SARS-CoV-2-specic nAbs recovered from infected humans also protected Syrian hamsters and rhesus macaques in challenge studies ( 35,36). Ideally, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would induce long-lasting Abs , but it is not yet known how long specic Abs persist in SARS- CoV-2 infected individuals or how long they would persist after vaccination. Indeed, several recent studies indicat e rapid waning of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs in some individuals following natural infection, although others maintained high levels to 60-94 days ( 37,38), raising concerns about the persistence of nAbs post-immunization; whether nAbs plateau or continue to decline over time is yet to be determined. By contrast, nAbsto SARS and MERS have been detected up to 2-3 years after infection in human survivors ( 39) and a recent study reports nAbs 17 years after SARS infection, suggesting that long-las ting coronavirus-specicnAbscanbeinducedinsomeinstances( 40) so hopefully Ab mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be equally long-lasting. Importantly, class-switched IgG memo ry B cells to S and RBD have been demonstrated in COVID-19 patients conrming the generation of B cell memory which can provide a rapid recall response on subsequent SARS-CoV- 2 exposure ( 41). Furthermore, we do not yet know what level of nAbs are required for protection ( 42). The standardization of a range of assays to support vaccine studies, such as viral neutralization assays, to enable comparison of dierent vacci ne candidates in dierent populations will be key to facilitating vaccine development, an issue which represents a current focu s oftheWHO( 43). T Cell Adaptive Immunity: Protection, Immune Suppression or Disease Enhancement?

Activation of T helper 1 (Th1) CD4+ T cells via viral peptides presented on HLA class II alleles further enhances the CD8+T cell response, while HLA class Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls FIGURE 3 | Key components of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV- 2. The adaptive immune response is activated following vira l uptake and antigen processing by a range of APCs. The APCs present viral antigen to B cells which then differentiate into antibody producing plasma cells. The neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) then bind to key viral proteins, such as the spike prot ein, and neutralize their activity. Other Ab-mediated anti viral functions include antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cellular phagocy tosis activatio n (ADCA). Cytotoxic CD8+T cells kill virally infected cells via the production of granzymes and perforin and the expression of Fas ligand (FasL), all of which mediate cellular apoptosis. A series of CD4+T cell populations are involved in the adaptive cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. Follicular helper T cells (T FH) and Th2 CD4+T cells both provide help for B cell antibody production. Th1 and Th17 CD4+T cells are also thought to play a role in the inflammatory respo nse and viral killing. CD4+regulatory T cells have been implicated with an immunoregulatory role in SARS-CoV-2 infection via the pr oduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and contact-mediat ed cellular suppression. Whether CD8+Tregs and Bregs play a role is not currently known. II-restricted follicular helper (T FH) and Th2 cells enhance virus- specic antibody production ( Figure3). Eective viral clearance therefore requires a combination of CD8+CTL and CD4+T cell mediated enhancement of B cell and CD8+T cell responses (20). Pro-inflammatory Th17 also play a role as evidenced bytheir high frequency in lung biopsy specimens of COVID-19 patients ( 44) (Figure3). Severe viral disease, associated with an over exuberant T cell response, leads to local inflammation and toxicity, thus activation of immune modulatory factors or checkpointsiscrucialinlimitingthedamage.Indeed,regul atory Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls T cells (Tregs) play a key role in the control of inflammation and immunopathology in other coronavirus infections ( 45), but this has yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure3).

Severe COVID-19 patients exhibit immunological features associated with T cell anergy or exhaustion. For example, the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients contain high levels of CD8+T cells expressing classic markers and genes of exhaustion ( 29), while patients who have recovered from moderate or severe COVID-19 seem to have robust memory T cell formation ( 48). These inltrating cells also express high levels of markers of activation and cytotoxicity. Other stu dies have similarly demonstrated that more activated and, in som e cases, more exhausted T cells develop in symptomatic COVID- 19 patients compared to levels during the prodromal stage (49). Those who experience mild-moderate disease maintain their lymphocyte counts and have more polyfunctional T cells; while studies in those with severe disease are contradictin g, reporting both lower and higher CD8+T cell cytotoxicity (49). Severe disease is associated with profound lymphopaenia lending support to the theory that the disease also causes immunosuppression, although lymphocyte tracking to the site of infection may also be responsible ( 49). A biphasic T cell response has therefore been proposed, characterized by an early CD8+cytotoxic T cell response to control the virus followed by T cell exhaustion and depletion as a result of viral persistence over many weeks in some patients. This model could account for poorer outcomes in the elderly who have diminished T cell repertoires and better outcomes in children who have a diverse and abundant na\u00efve T cell pool (29). Nevertheless, the likely early protective role for CD4+ and CD8+T cells in SARS-CoV-2 clearance suggests that their induction should be exploited in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developmentstrategies. KNOWLEDGE FROM SARS AND MERS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT No vaccine is licensed or available for SARS or MERS, however,considerablepreclinicaldevelopmentstudieshave been performed. A range of vaccine development approaches were explored, including live attenuated vaccines and inactivat ed vaccines (such as inactivated whole virus), soluble protein vaccines, viral vectors, nanoparticles, and DNA vaccines; m ost of these platforms are also being utilized for SARS-CoV-2, as discussed below ( 50,51). Most of the SARS and MERS subunit candidate vaccines have targeted the S glycoprotein and been examined in studies conducted in animal models, although N, M, and E protein-based vaccines have also been tested ( 20).However, the fact that animal models, including mice and non- human primates, display only limited clinical manifestations o f SARS and MERS, that it is not usually lethal, severely limit the translation of results into humans. To overcome this, animal adapted strains and transgenic animal models of severe diseas e havebeendeveloped( 20,52). In virus challenge studies in animals, high titers of nAbs to both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS virus correlated with protection (51,53). Relatively few studies have investigated the protective role of T cells, and while some correlate CD4+and CD8+ T cell responses with protection, adoptive transfer and T cell depletion assays in mice suggest they are not necessary for protection in mice immunized with a DNA-based SARS vaccine ( 54). Furthermore, vaccination of mice with SARS and MERS candidate vaccines has been shown to result in Th2 lung pathology with eosinophilic inltration following wild-type virus challenge ( 54-57). This immunopathological eect has been associated with whole virus vaccines with and without adjuvant and linked with responses to the N protein in particular; S protein-based vaccines may have a lesser eect . An N protein-based DNA SARS vaccine also elicited a delayed typehypersensitivityreactioninmice,furthercautioninga gainst using this protein for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ( 57). Furthermore, S-based vaccines appear more immunogenic and protective in these studies and the duration of protection has been shown in challenge studies to last 3-12 months in mice immunized with a vesicularstomatitisvirus(VSV)-basedSARSvaccineandanim als immunized with DNA and/or protein-based MERS vaccines (23,58). Of note, in the former study, protection against viral challengewascompleteinyoungermicebutlimitedinsenescen t mice,highlightingpotentialissueswithsuccessfulvaccin ationin olderindividuals( 59). The only SARS vaccines to reach human phase 1 clinical trialswerebasedoninactivatedvirus,solubleSglycoprotei nand DNA approaches ( 52). MERS vaccines tested in human phase 1 clinical trials include a DNA-based vaccine alone ( 60); DNA in combination with adenovirus or modied vaccinia (MVA) viral vectors and a chimp adenovirus vaccine ( 62). Ecacy against disease has not been tested in humans since it has not been deemed ethical to perform challenge studies with lethal viruses for which ther e is noeectivetreatment. VIRAL SEQUENCING AND IMMUNOINFORMATICS TO INFORM RATIONAL VACCINE DESIGN The rst SARS-CoV-2 genome was isolated from patients with pneumonia from Wuhan, China in early 2020 and identied as a novel human coronavirus ( 63,64). Since that time, multiple viruses have been isolated and sequenced from patients throughout the world providing an understanding of the evolutionary capacity and diversity of this pathogen (63). Structural genomics and molecular interaction analysis (interactomics) can be used to rapidly identify putative functionalsites,facilitatingrationalvaccinedesignbyi dentifying Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 6 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls potential B and T cell epitope regions of key viral proteins (65). Several groups have used computational programs and immunoinformaticstopredictCD4+andCD8+TcellandBcell epitopes across multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens from sequence data to design novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines ( 66,67). The genetic diversity and stability of these regions over ti me can then be characterized, and cross-reactivity predicted a nd examined to ensure a vaccine provides cross-strain immunity . The S gene of human coronaviruses is well-known to undergo genetic drift which could compromise SARS-CoV-2 vaccines basedonthisregion( 68,69).Reassuringly,comparisonsbetween thesequencesofknownSARS-CoV-1BandTcellepitopesfrom the N and S proteins have been shown that some of the epitopes mapidenticallytoproteinsfromSARS-CoV-2( 70).Importantly, these epitopes showed SARS- CoV-2sequencessuggestingthattheyresideinstablepartso fthe Sprotein.TheTcellepitopesalsocoveredabroadrangeofHLA allelesandcouldthereforebefuturetargetsforvaccinede sign. One issue with this approach is that the epitopes will be specic for human HLA alleles, making it dicult to test them for protective ecacy in animal models. One way to overcome this problem is to use humanized mouse models which have functional human immune systems ( 71), bearing in mind that mice can also be modied to express the ACE2 receptor ( 72). Also,thereareoftenanimalhomologsofhumanCD4andCD8T cell epitopes so it may still be possible to screen for ecacy. However,itshouldbeborneinmindthatduetotheurgentneed to develop an eective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, animal challenge data are not a mandatory pre-requisite to progression to clini cal trials; nevertheless, ideally these should be conducted as part of the vaccine development strategy. The recent development of a laboratory-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain that is pathogenic in mice, provides an ideal animal challenge model for testing th e ecacyofSARS-CoV-2candidatevaccinesinmice( 73). DIFFERENT VACCINE APPROACHES USED IN COVID-19 VACCINE DEVELOPMENT Vaccine technology has been advancing rapidly and there is a plethora of approaches to constructing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Theserangefromtheoriginaltechniqueemployedcenturiesa go in the smallpox vaccine development of using modied or killed whole organism, to protein and peptide-based vaccines, nuclei c acid DNA and RNA vaccines and nanoparticle constructs. Each approach has unique advantages and disadvantages including varyingtimetodevelopmentandscalability,cost,stabilit y,aswell asanticipatedsafetyandimmunogenicityproles;allapproach es are represented among preclinical and clinical trials ( 58-60) (Figure4). The Need for Vaccine Adjuvants Some vaccine particularly protein-based vaccin es, requireanadjuvanttoboosttheirimmunogenicity( 74).Todate, very few adjuvants have been licensed for human use since the originaladoptionofaluminumsalts(alum)fromtheearly1920 s,which bias immunity toward a Th2 response ( 75). Several of the neweradjuvantsconsistofToll-likereceptoragoniststost imulate innate immunity combined with alum, such as AS04 which is based on are stronger adjuvants than alum and have been adopted in several licensed influenza vaccines. The adjuvant AS01, present in th e malariavaccineRTS,S,combinesMPLandasaponinQS-21( 75). A wide variety of adjuvant approaches are being taken with the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, including those mentioned above, some of which are described in the relevant sectionsbelow( 76). Different Routes of Vaccination Many vaccines are given via the intramuscular route, includ ing the majority of the current COVID-19 vaccines in development (Table1). However, since SARS-CoV-2 causes infection via the respiratorytract,avaccinetargetingthemucosalimmunesy stem mightbepreferable( 77).Mucosalvaccineshavetheadvantageof beingneedle-freeandthuspracticalformass-administration ,but immune tolerance induction can be an issue. The formulation, includingtheuseofmucosaladjuvants,isthereforeimportan tto ensurestimulationofadequatelocalandsystemicimmunity (78). Several groups have developed mucosal SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. A deoptimized live attenuated whole virus vaccine is being developed for intranasal (i.n.) administration, and s everal adenovirus-based vaccines will also be administered via the i.n. route (Table1). An oral probiotic pill-based SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine (bacTRL) is also planned for clinical trials ( Table1). The sublingual route is also considered an attractive route fo r inducing mucosal immunity ( 77). An alternative approach is to combineparenteralvaccineswithadjuvantssuchasretinoic acid and CAF01 which are known to induce protective IgA mucosal responses( 79,80). Researchers are also investigating self-administered mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to overcome the need for a healthcare worker to administer the vaccine. For example , InovioTMhave developed a novel hand-held CELLECTRAR/circlecopyrt 2000 intradermal delivery device which uses a brief electrica l pulse to reversibly open skin cell pores to allow the entry of their INO-4800 DNA plasmid vaccine ( 81) (Table1). The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has developed an intradermal microneedle patch that can deliver SARS-CoV-2 proteinantigens,eitherSorRBD(PittCoVacc),throughtheski n whichwillenterhumantrialssoon( 82)(Table1).Thisapproach delivers antigen and danger signals to the high-density derm al APCs stimulating a highly eective immune response, even in the absence of adjuvant. It requires only low doses of antige n thus reducing production costs. Indeed, this method induced more potent S1-specic nAbs in mice than the traditional needle injections, with or without the inclusion of TLR ligan d sequences( 83).

SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls FIGURE 4 | Vaccine platforms being employed for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine de sign. This gure illustrates the different vaccine approach es being taken for the design of human SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Whole virus vaccines include bo th attenuated and inactivated forms of the virus and subunit s of inactivated virus can also be used. Protein and peptide subunit vaccines are usually combined w ith an adjuvant in order to enhance immunogenicity. The main emphasis in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development has been on using the whole spike protein in its t rimeric form or components of it, such as the RBD region. Mult iple non-replicating viral vector vaccines have been developed, particularly focused on adenovirus; w hile there has been less emphasis on the replicating viral ve ctor constructs. Nucleic acid-based approaches include DNA and mRNA vaccines, often packaged in to nanocarriers such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and lip id nanoparticles (LNPs). Nanoparticle and VLP vaccines can also have antigen attached to their surface or combined in their core. The immune cell therapy approach u ses genetically modied SARS-CoV-2-specic cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells ex pressing viral antigens to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infe ction. Each of these vaccine approaches has benets and disadvantages in terms of cost and ease of product ion, safety prole and immunogenicity, and it remains to be se en which of the many candidates in development protect against COVID-19. factors so as to not cause disease, but retains its ability to replicateinthevaccinerecipient,andstimulatearobustimm une response that protects against infection ( 84-86). These vaccines tend to be highly immunogenic, do not require an adjuvant and provide long-lasting immunity. However, they are usuall y contraindicatedinthoseimmunocompromisedorpregnant. It is dicult to develop a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine quickly because of the time and knowledge required to ensure that it is suitably attenuated and all virulence fa ctors removed. Reverse genetics can be employed for the rational design of the ideal attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine virus, for example by determining key virulence factors, as has been done for other coronaviruses ( 87). Long-term maintenance of consistentlivevaccinestocksisalsoproblematic( 85,86).Despite the challenges, three codon-pair deoptimized live attenuate d vaccines are currently undergoing pre-clinical testing, bu t none have yet progressed to clinical trials ( 7) (Table1). These three candidates are being developed by Codegenix/Serum Institut eof India, Indian Immunologicals Ltd/Grith University and Mehment Ali Aydinlar University in Turkey, respectively ( 7). This approach relies on using a single virus strain which may not cross-protect against other strains, particularly as the virus continuestospreadworldwideandmutatesasselectionpressur e increasesonceimmunitybecomesmorewidespread.

It induced nAbs to both vaccine and non-vaccine strains and provided partial or complete protection of macaques in challenge studies and has now entered human clinical trials in China ( Table2). The China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) have also developed inactivated whole viru s vaccines with the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products an d Beijing Institute of Biological Products which are current ly in phase 3 clinical trials. The Wuhan vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in a randomized, double-blind, placebo - controlledphase1/2trial,whichrecentlyreportedinterimr esults (89). The phase 1 study tested three doses of 3 dierent vaccine concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5g per dose) of their alum adjuvantedvaccinevs.alumadjuvantaloneplaceboin96heal thy adults; and the phase 2 tested two doses of 5 \u00b5g vs. alum alone in 224 18-59 year old healthy adults.

Protein and Peptide Vaccines Rather than using the whole or a split fragment of the virus as the vaccine, antigenic proteins (or peptides) of the virus ca n be generated using recombinant technology in the laborator y instead (98). This is the most popular approach in the SARS- CoV-2 vaccine development eld, with 50 protein/peptide constructs in preclinical trials and 8 that have entered clini cal trials (Table1). They are relatively simple vaccines to make and thus cheap to produce. A major advantage over whole virus vaccines is their relative safety since unnecessary reacto genic components such as lipopolysaccharides and toxins can be excluded. However, protein/peptide vaccines often require adjuvants and multiple doses in order to stimulate an adequat e immune response. Peptide vaccines usually consist of 15-30 amino acid B cell and T cell epitope regions of key antigens allowing for a precise and targeted immune response. Peptide- basedvaccineshavebeendevelopedascandidatesagainstsev eral viral pathogens, but few have been licensed except for use in veterinary practice ( 99). This is in part due to their inherent limitations including a narrow breadth of immune response, Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al.

Focus on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein ThemajorityofSARS-CoV-2candidatevaccinesindevelopment are based on the S protein or its RBD region ( Figure1) (100). Indeed, ve of the current protein/peptide vaccine candidates in clinical trials target the full S protein and the other two tar get RBDonly( Table2). Some novel technologies have been employed to overcome the issue of the S glycoprotein losing its immunogenic conformational form. The University of Queensland has developed a molecular clamp technique that uses proteins to stabilize the S protein in its coiled shape. This seeks to ensur e that functional nAbs are produced that will tightly bind to vir us in its native form and thus prevent cell entry ( 101) (Table2). Other groups have focused on using powerful adjuvants to ensure immunogenicity, for example Novavax's recombinant S protein SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, combined with an adjuvant called Matrix-M1TM. This is a saponin-based adjuvant that enhances APC recruitment and action and stimulates high levels of nAbs and cell-mediated immune responses ( 102). The S protein in NVX-CoV2373 is presentitsnativetrimericformandhasbeenshowntostimula te high levels of nAbs in mice and baboons in preclinical studies .Primary phase 1 clinical trial results have just been reported from a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled tri al of NVX-CoV2373 conducted in 131 healthy adults ( 90) (Table2). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed for 2 doses of vacci ne (5 and 25 \u00b5g) with ( n=106) or without ( n=25) the Matrix-M1TMadjuvant (a 50 \u00b5g dose). A strong correlation was observed between nAb titers and anti-spike IgG to S protein with the adjuvanted, but not the unadjuvanted, vacci ne. Levels were comparable to those in convalescent ( r= 0.958). Both 5 and 25 \u00b5g adjuvanted doses elicited responses of similar magnitude and every participant seroconverted by both assays. T cell responses measured in 16 participants showedthatNVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1inducesantigen-specic cell responses to spike protein stimulation; there was a strong biastowardthisTh1phenotype.Thesafetydataarediscussedi n section Comparative Safety and Tolerability Results for Curr ent SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates in Clinical Trials and this vaccineisnowprogressingtophase2trials. Clover Biopharmaceuticals's protein Trimer Tag\u00a9 vaccine UQ vaccine uses MF59 adjuvant; the Vaxine Pty Ltd. S protein vaccine has a special AdvaxTMadjuvant; and the Medigen S based construct is combined with the adjuvant CpG ( Table2). Generex Biotechnology, in partnership with Epivax, have developed a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (EPV-Cov19) based on li-Key technology with undisclosed SARS-CoV-2 peptides ( 103). This uses synthetic peptides chemically linked to the 4-amino acid Ii-Key to ensure robust immune activation of Th1 and Th2 CD4+T cells in particular, which in turn facilitate antibody production( 104,105).

Vector viruses are usually genetically modied to reduce th eir virulence and render them replication defective. Adenoviru ses and poxviruses are the most widely used non-replicating viral vectors, but many other viruses can also be adapted for vaccin e delivery. Replicating viral vectors, such as measles virus an d vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), can also be used for SARS- CoV-2 vaccine design; they mimic natural infection, render ing them self-adjuvanting and therefore more potent, and can be used in lower doses ( 107). While subunit vaccines are more focusedoninductionofhumoralimmunity,viralvectorvacc ines are able to induce robust cell mediated immunity (CMI) in addition to Abs and have been shown in animal models to protect against challenge with pathogenic coronaviruses ( 51).

Non-replicating Viral Vector SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Human adenoviruses are the most common non-replicating viral vectors being used for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development;constituting 3 of the 5 in clinical trials and 7 of the 19 in preclinical development ( Table1). The three in clinical trials Ad26COVS1 ( 108) and Gamelaya'sAd26-basedGam-COVID-VacLyovaccine( Table2). All encode the S protein. While adenovirus vectors are well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in most people, pre- existingimmunitytotheviralvectorcanhampertheinductio nof immunity,particularlyafterrepeateddoses.Animaladenovi ruses can be used as vectors instead of human ones to overcome this problem, which is the approach used for the Oxford University chimpanzee adenovirus-based candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also called AZD1222) and the simian adenovirus-based ReiThera vaccine GRAd, both of which are in clinical trials ( Table2). Anti-vector immunity can still develop after the rst dose of vaccine even if a simian adenovirus vec tor is used.

Intracellular staining conrmedproductionofIFN- InstitutePasteurreplicatingviralvectorvaccinecandida teTMV- 083, based on measles virus, is the only viral vector vaccine that has entered phase 1 clinical trials to date ( Table2), but there are 17 more at the pre-clinical stage of development. These includ e 5 each based on influenza virus or VSV, 3 more measles virus- based candidates, and 1 each based on avian paramyxovirus, horsepox(calledTNX-1800),Newcastlediseasevirus,andye llow fever virus ( Table1). The majority target the S protein or RBD, although one measles virus-based candidate also targets th e N protein. Two of the influenza-based candidates are designed for intranasal administration. A live attenuated yellow fev er vector-based vaccine (YFS0) expressing the prefusion form of the S protein recently showed that a single dose protected most hamstersinaSARS-CoV-2challengemodel( 109). Nucleic Acid-Based Vaccines (DNA or mRNA) (DNA or mRNA) oer a cost- ecient and scalable approach to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development ( 110). The major nucleic acid-based approaches aredescribedbelow. DNA Vaccines DNA-based vaccines are stable and safe to handle. However, while there are multiple DNA vaccine constructs targeting numerous viral infections in animal and human studies, todate none have been licensed for human use. Naked DNA can be injected and taken up by APC or APC can be directly transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the target antigen. Subsequent expression and presentation of the target antigen leads to the induction of antigen-specic CD4+and CD8+T cells and antibody production. However, DNA vaccines tend to be poorly immunogenic, necessitating various strategies t o improve immunogenicity such as the use of viral promotors, immunostimulatorysequencesandadjuvants.Nanocarrierss uch a virus like particles (VLPs) can also be used to improve DNA delivery,avoiditsdegradationandbeimmunostimulatory.T here aresafetyconcernsaboutpotentialintegrationintothehos tDNA causing dysregulated gene expression although the risk of th is is thoughttobeverylow. A series of animal studies with SARS-CoV-1 nucleic acid- based vaccines have shown induction of nAbs and cellular immunity, with partial protection against turkey CoV challen ge (13) and vaccine-induced Ab-mediated protection to the S protein in mice ( 51). Twelve DNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines arecurrentlyinpreclinicaldevelopmentand4morehaveenter ed phase 1/2 clinical trials ( Table1). Two DNA-based candidates in clinical trials are administered i.m., whereas the other 2 are administered via the intradermal (i.d.) route ( Table2). Inovio Pharmaceuticals is testing their CELLECTRAR/circlecopyrtelectroporation i.d. delivery device to administer their S protein-based DNA plasmid vaccine INO-4800 which induces nAbs and T cells in mice and guinea pigs ( 111) (Table2). An alternative approach currently in pre-clinical trials is being taken by Symvivo wit h their DNA B. longum vaccine bacTRL which is administered as anoralpill( 112).

The y also have a good safety prole, since they are not made with pathogenanddonotintegrateintohostDNA.Severalchalleng es encountered by mRNA vaccines include the need for packaging, for example into particles or liposomes, as naked RNA is otherwise rapidly broken down and the need for freezing or refrigerationforwidescaledelivery. There are currently 16 RNA-based vaccines in pre-clinical trials and 6 have entered clinical trials ( Table1). The clinical trial candidates include two lipid nanoparticle encapsulated RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that have already progressed to phase 3 trials ( Table2). Moderna/NIAID have published preliminary results from their phase 1 dose-ranging, safety an d immunogenicity trial of 2 doses of mRNA-1273 encoding the S proteinconductedin45healthyadultsaged18-55years( 94).The S protein in mRNA-1273 is stabilized in its prefusion state by 2 prolinesubstitutionsintheS2subunit;andthelipidnanoparti cle coat consists of 4 lipids.

The safety data for both will be reviewed in a later safetysection. The remaining RNA-based candidates in clinical trials include three in phase 1 and one in phase 1/2 ( Table2). The Imperial College London LNP-encapsulated RNA vaccine consists of an S protein-based self-amplifying RNA construct (LNP-nCoVsaRNA); designed because saRNA vaccines induce a more stable DNA product and are more immunogenic than conventionalnucleicacidvaccines( 115)(Table1).

Materials used to construct nanoparticle vaccines include self-assembling viruses (virus like particles [VLPs]), lipi ds (as liposomes),proteins,metals(e.g.,gold)andpolymerswhicha lso actastheirownadjuvant( 117). Many nanoparticles are highly stable and less prone to degradation than other constructs such as \"naked\" protein, peptide, DNA and RNA vaccines ( 116,118). Selected antigens, which may be proteins or nucleic acid, can either be attached t o thesurfaceofthenanoparticlesorcombinedintheparticleco re. Theycanbesynthesizedinavarietyofshapesandsizestoindu ce robust innate as well as adaptive immunity. Other modicatio ns includealteringthenanoparticlesurfacetotargetcertain cellsor enhance immunogenicity and packaging with TLR ligands and otherimmunemodulators. One of the most popular approaches for viral vaccine development is engineering VLPs consisting of self-assembl ed viral membrane in a monomeric complex which display the viral epitopes but lack multiple key viral components, ensuring they have no replication capacity ( 119). The widely used human papillomavirus(HPV)vaccinesareanexampleofthisapproach. A nanoparticle polypeptide vaccine displaying SARS-specic B cell epitope repeats from the C terminal heptad repeat region of the S protein in its native coiled formation was shown to elici t nAbsinmice( 120).A number of the SARS- CoV-2 vaccine candidates use nanocarriers to package the vaccine product to improve stabilityand ensure ecient antig en processing ( 118). As mentioned above, Novavax's full length S protein construct NVX-CoV2373 is a nanoparticle vaccine and themajorityofmRNA-basedSARS-CoV-2vaccinesarepackaged LNPs, BNT162. There are 12 SARS- CoV-2 VLP vaccines in preclinical development and just one in a phase 1 clinical trial ( Table1). The latter vaccine developed by Mendicago Inc. consists of plant-derived recombinant VLPs made by transfecting viral genes into the cell nuclei of leave s permittingtransientexpressionofviralproteinswhichformi nto VLPs which are extracted and puried for clinical use ( 121) (Table2). Immune Cell Therapy SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approaches based on CAR-T cell concepts are also being tested in clinical trials. The Shenzhen Geno- immune Medical Institute in China is using a lentiviral vector system to create viral minigenes which express viral proteins (S, M, E and N proteins) and immune modulatory genes (P polyprotein protease) to antigens will DC) and antigen- speciccytotoxicTcellvaccinesarecurrentlybeingtested bys.c. injection or i.v. infusion in a phase 1/2 multicenter therapeu tic clinical trial in participants ranging from 6 months to 80 year s of age (122) (Table2). The same company has also developed articial DCs expressing SARS-CoV-2 mini-genes for various viral proteins which are being tested in a phase 1 clinical trial as a s.c. injection in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in the sa me age range ( Table2). Autologous DCs expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigenshavealsobeendevelopedbyAivitaBiomedInc.inUSA and are being tested as a s.c. administered vaccine in phase 1 clinical trials in healthy adults >18 years of age ( 123) (Table2). Whilst not suitable for large-scale delivery and use, immune cell therapy might be used in the context of pre-emptive therapy in high-riskpatientssuchastheelderlyandimmunocompromised . REPURPOSING OLD VACCINES TO PROVIDE NON-TARGETED ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY There is increasing evidence that immunization with live vaccines can improve survival against non-vaccine targeted infections, a phenomenon termed \"non-specic,\" \"o-target,\" or \"heterologous\" eects of vaccines ( 124,125). Some of the best evidence comes from studies of immunization with the tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG); for example, BCG has been shown in three trials to markedlyreduceall-causemortalityinlowbirthweightneo nates (126). BCG causes epigenetic modication of innate immune cells(monocytesandnaturalkiller(NK)cells)therebyenhanc ing innate responses in a process called innate immune training (127,128). Experiments in both murine models and humans Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 14 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls have further shown that BCG protects against certain viral pathogens( 129). Reports that people living in countries where childhood BCG is routinely given have lower COVID-19 mortality have been posited as further evidence for protective eects of BCG (130).However,theseobservationsarefraughtwithconfounder s, including diculty ascertaining COVID-19 infection rates in these countries, the time the virus rst entered the country and dierences in national control strategies ( 131). Furthermore, other studies contradict these ndings, such as a geographic regression discontinuity analysis along the East and West German border showing that the COVID-19 infection rates do not vary according to the BCG vaccination strategies employe d during the cold war ( 132); and a study from Israel showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in adults did not dier by BCG at birthstatus( 133). EvenifchildhoodBCGimmunizationdoesnotprotectagainst COVID-19,aBCGdoseasanadultmayprovidesomeshort-term protection. Indeed, that the non- specic benecial eects of BCG might protect against COVID- 19, resulting in an explosion of interest in this vaccine as a protective strategy in recent months ( 134,135). This has led to a number of clinical trials being established in North and So uth America,Australasia,AfricaandEurope,alltestingtheabi lityof BCG vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, mostly in high-risk exposed healthcare workers ( 136) (Table2). These trials collectively aim to recruit >20,000 participants, with the largest trial of 10,078 healthcare workers currently recru iting acrossmultiplesitesinAustraliaandEurope. Non-specic protective eects of live vaccines have also been postulated for oral polio vaccine (OPV) ( 137) and measles vaccine (138). As a result, a study of the protective eects of OPV against COVID-19 is due to commence in USA in June (139), and a clinical trial of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization and COVID-19 protection is being conducted in Egypt(Table3). Aconsistentfeatureoftheo-targeteectsoflivevaccinesh as been their sex-dierential nature; females often showing gr eater susceptibilitytotheseimmunomodulatoryeects( 124,125,140- 142).Indeed,sexdierencesintargetedvaccineimmunogenicit y and adverse events have also been widely described ( 141,142). This raises the possibility that any o-target protective eect of live vaccines may dier between the sexes and that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates may show sex dierences in immunogenicityandreactogenicity. Itispossible,butuncertain,thatstrategiestousetheseal ready licensed vaccines may provide a modest level of protection against COVID-19, including those at highest risk, such as healthcare workers. It is important to recognize, however, that data from these studies will still need to accrue whilst we are waiting for SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines to come through the pipeline. Given the unprecedented speed at which targeted vaccines are being developed, this approach may not be necessary or required; furthermore, these existing l ive vaccines are not currently recommended for this indication , so should only be utilized in this context in the setting of a clinicaltrial.TABLE 4 | Some of the key challenges to successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.

POTENTIAL CHALLENGES IN SARS-CoV-2 VACCINE DEVELOPMENT Even if an ecacious vaccine is developed there are a number of immunological challenges that need to be considered. Furthermore,thereistheenormouschallengeofmassproduct ion andrapidandequitabledelivery( Table4). Potential for Modest Vaccine Protection ItisextremelyunlikelythatanyoftheSARS-CoV-2vaccinesw ill be100%eective;whiletheymaynotpreventbecominginfected , it is hoped that they will prevent progression to severe disease. Indeed, the seasonal influenza vaccine is generally about 50 % protectiveagainstinfectionbutdoesdecreasediseasesever ityand hospitalization rates ( 143). A recent study in which macaques were vaccinated with the Oxford University and AstraZeneca adenovirusvaccine,ChAdOx1nCoV-19,foundthattheprimate s were protected from SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia ( 144). However, the macaques still had high levels of virus replicati ng in their upper respiratory tract. It is hoped that even if the vaccines do not prevent infection in the upper airways, they may reduce viral load and disease severity and in turn, the amount of virus a vaccinated person transmits to others. Even a modestly ecacious SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could mitigate the severity of this pandemic and be highly benecial in a world struggling to contain this novel virus and its devastating s ocial andeconomiceects. Most vaccines are tested in healthy young adult males and non-pregnant women and, if safe, they are then tested in healthy children prior to licensure. This therefore raises the issue that any vaccines may initially have less empiric data availableonuseincertainkeyvulnerablepopulationssuchast he elderly,immunocompromisedgroupsandpregnantwomen.Itis plausiblethatvaccinesmaybeconsiderablylessimmunogenic in older and frail elderly who experience the most severe outcom es from COVID-19, hence the importance of adjuvants in many Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls of the vaccine candidates, both for dose sparing and enhancin g immunogenicity ( 145). Ecacy in this population is also likely to vary by the type of vaccine construct and adjuvant used. This has been seen for other diseases such as influenza, where the adjuvanted and high dose vaccines are more immunogenic than the standard inactivated vaccines in the elderly ( 146,147). Similarly, for the and liposome - based AS01B adjuvant) ( 148). Thus, ensuring studies can be conducted in these priority target groups, either pre- or early- postdeployment,willbecriticalandspecialformulationsmay be requiredtoensureadequateimmunogenicity. Cross-Reactive Coronaviruses Antibodies, Original Antigenic Sin and Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of Immunity Throughout life, humans are repeatedly exposed to the endemic humanseasonalcoronavirusesanddevelophumanCoV(hCoV) antibody repertoires that can potentially cross-react with S ARS- CoV-2-specic antigens ( 149). This early immune imprinting leads to preferential expansion of cross-reactive Abs when a related antigen is encountered, in this case SARS-CoV-2 ( 150). This long-recognized process is called original antigenic s in (OAS)(151)andisknowntooccurwithseveralcommonviruses, suchasinfluenzaandrespiratorysyncytialvirus( 152,153).OAS can either lead to a less eective immune response or cause enhancedimmunityandimmunopathology( 149,150,154).OAS is one of the mechanisms responsible for the phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of immunity which is thought to occur in COVID-19, whereby non-neutralizing cross-reactive Abs against other coronaviruses enhance ho st cell entry and viral infectivity and worsen disease severit y (150,154,155). This was seen to occur in cats vaccinated against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus ( 156-158) and certain SARS and MERS vaccine platforms also appear to have shown worsened immunopathology in animal challenge studies comparedwithplacebo( 159). Recently, it was shown in vitro using human cells that nAbs to coronavirus S protein can also trigger ADE by causing a conformational change of the S protein ( 160). Antigen-experienced older individuals are more susceptible to the phenomenon of ADE, while less antigen-experienced younger individuals mount more targeted antibody responses to viral neoantigens. This may in part account for the greater immunopathology of COVID-19 in older individuals. Indeed, it has been shown recently that COVID-19-na\u00efve children and elderly have quite dierent cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-speci c antibody signatures, which would play diering roles upon challengewiththewild-typevirus( 161). Theoretically,aSARS-CoV-2vaccinecouldskewtheimmune system toward production of less eective or even harmful cross-reactive hCoV Abs via these processes of OAS and ADE, rather than induce highly-targeted SARS-CoV-2-specic Abs as intended ( 162). Indeed, anti-spike Abs taken from criticallyunwell COVID-19 patients with severe lung injury skewed macrophages in vitro into a pro-inflammatory phenotype, implicating the Abs in driving the surge in lung-resident pro- inflammatory macrophages and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the lungs ( 163). The authors attribute an aberrant IgG glycosylation pattern in severe COVID-19 patien ts with their more pro-inflammatory properties so hopefully the IgGs induced by vaccination will not have this problem. Indee d, none of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in human clinical trials have reportedly caused ADE to date, although the numbe r of human subjects studied to date is still relatively small. Since animal challenge data are not required to progress to clinicalSARS-CoV-2vaccinetrials,theopportunitytoscreenf or potential adverse events including ADE at the pre-clinical st age of development may be missed. Having said that, many of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have undergone considerable pre-clinical testing, including challenge studies. There wa s no evidence of ADE in pre-clinical SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies in rhesus macaques following immunization with 1 dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ( 144) or 2 doses of the inactivated whole virus vaccine candidate BBIBP-CorV ( 97), both of which were protectiveinthesestudies.Itispostulatedthatbasingtheva ccine on the S1 RBD terminal subunit of the S glycoprotein should overcomethisproblembyinducingnAbsonly,althoughthisha s notbeenprovenand,notably,onlyafewvaccinecandidatesha ve taken this approach. Furthermore, the in vitroconformational changescausingADEdescribedaboveoccurintheRBDdomain, sothisapproachmaynotbesuccessful. Aberrant T Cell Responses Aberrant manifestations of T cell responses were observed in the 1960s for other viral vaccine candidates, such as inacti vated vaccines against measles and respiratory syncytial virus (RS V), resulting in vaccine associated enhanced respiratory diseas e (VAERD) upon subsequent wild-type pathogen exposure (164,165). A major driver of this was accentuation of Th2 cytokines, with resultant allergic (eosinophilic) and airway hyperesponsiveness. This was compounded by another mechanism related to the conformation of the vaccine antige n, resulting in the generation of excessive non-neutralizing Ab. Having a high amount of binding, but not neutralizing, Ab caused immune complex deposition and complement activation with local inflammation in the presence of a high viral load. It will therefore be important for vaccine candidates to mitigat e the risk of VAERD by considering the T cell prole induced by vaccination, avoiding Th2 biased CD4+T cell immunity and biasing toward CD8+cytotoxic T cell responses. The alum adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate PiCoVacc co uld theoretically drive a Th2 skewed immune response. While this was not observed in macaque studies when analyzing Th1 and Th2cytokineproles,itisnotclearfromthepaperwhatsamples were used to measure these cytokines, clarication of which will be crucial in vaccine safety assessment ( 96). Many of the other vaccine constructs favor Th1 immunity, as demonstrate d in the published human trial results for several of the viral vector (91-93) and mRNA vaccines ( 94) and the Novavax nanoparticle Matrix M adjuvant vaccine ( 90). Original antigenic Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 16 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls sin also applies to T cell responses and therefore pre-existing CoV-specic T cell memory may be enhanced by immunization with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine leading to either suboptimal T cell responsesorimmunopathology( 151,166). Vaccine Safety Assessment Vaccine Safety Monitoring Pre and Post-deployment Vaccine safety assessment is integrated into all stages of the clinical development pipeline for candidate vaccines and continues once vaccines are deployed into the population. Randomized controlled clinical trials examine safety, as w ell as immunogenicity and ecacy. Decisions on the participant numbers to be included in phase 3 studies will likely be powered on ecacy endpoints, but these studies also need to be of sucient size and planned duration to ensure comparison of injection site, systemic and unanticipated or \"unsolicite d\" adverse events between groups. Comprehensive safety studies are particularly critical because some candidate vaccines u se platform technologies that have not been examined extensive ly in human subjects to date, including some of the viral vectors, mRNA and nanoparticle constructs, and because of the potential for enhanced disease and adverse events relate d to aberrant immune responses to be seen upon infection pre- and post-licensure. A list of adverse events of special interest (known as AESI) across all body systems, including immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, musculosk eletal and dermatological manifestations, have been agreed by the BrightonCollaborationinconjunctionwithCEPIandtheWHO with input from regulatory agencies and other experts, as have the associated case denitions and surveillance strate gies (167,168). Listed conditions include anaphylaxis, vasculitides, myocarditis, generalized convulsions and meningoencephal itis, among many others. Comprehensive data on safety are essentia l to ensure that the benet:risk ratio of vaccination is favor able, to support decision-making by policy makers on wide-scale program implementation among healthy people, and to ensure that individuals are suciently condent to accept vaccinat ion. Some of these AESI will require post marketing (phase 4) studies but are also undergoing evaluation in some of the pre- clinical andearly phase evaluations, particularlythe large rphase 3studies. Comparative Safety and Tolerability Results for Current SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidates in Clinical Trials Interim phase 1/2 safety results have recently been published for two leading adenovirus-based vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 (91) and protein nanoparticle vaccine, NVX- CoV2373/Matrix-M1 ( 90). All candidates exhibited acceptable safety proles, and while local and systemic reactogenicity was common for the mRNA, adenovirus and adjuvanted protein nanoparticle constructs, the inactivated whole virus vacci ne was considerablylessreactogenic( Table5).Reactionsweregenerally mild to moderate and resolved within days. Importantly, ther ewere no serious adverse events reported for any of these vaccinecandidates. Pain at the injection site was a particularly common feature with the mRNA vaccines (approaching 100% in some groups), and while it was the commonest reaction to the inactivated vaccine, it was still lower for this candidate th an for the other vaccines ( Table5). Headache, myalgia and fatigue were the other most commonly reported symptoms for the mRNA, adenovirus and adjuvanted protein nanoparticle candidate vaccines ( Table5). Documented fever was relatively common for mRNA and adenovirus candidates but 5% for the inactivated virus nanoparticl e candidates ( Table5). The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 trial underwent a protocol amendment during the trial allowing several sites to administer paracetamol prior to vaccination and 6 hourly for 24h. This slightly reduced reports of pain, feeling feveri sh, chills, mylagia, headache and malaise but had no eect on conrmed fever. Pre-existing adenovirus 5 immunity, incre ased age and male sex were all associated with decreased fever following immunization with Ad5-nCoV ( 93). In terms of blood parameters, immunization with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was associated with transient neutropaenia and BNT162b1 withlymphopaenia. In the Ad5-nCoV phase 1 and 2 trials reactogenicity was dose-dependent for pain, headache and fever; while it was dose- dependent for almost all parameters for the mRNA vaccines (Table5). As a result of the high reactogenicity after a single dose of BNT162b1, it was decided not to give a second dose. Interestingly, the ten participants given a booster dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine had less reactogenicity after the seconddose.TheoppositewasfoundfortheBNT-162b1mRNA andNVX-CoV2373/Matrix-M1vaccinesforwhichreactogenici ty wasgreateraftertheseconddose( 90,95). These favorable safety results (alongside the good immunogenicityreportedearlierinthisarticle)haveallow edthe progression of the adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines to phase3clinicaltrials. Testing Vaccine Efcacy and Human SARS-CoV-2 Challenge Trials Whilst the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pipeline is progressing at unprecedented speed, there is a concern that suppression of viral transmission in many countries will make evaluation o f vaccine ecacy (VE) dicult, as phase 3 studies need sucient infection rates to compare disease incidence in vaccinated wi th control individuals. Reassuringly, planned studies are curre ntly expanding to higher burden countries where infrastructure t o conduct complex adaptive clinical trials exists. Nevertheless, the time needed to accrue sucient data on ecacy will be a criticaldeterminantimpactingvaccineavailability.Inth esetting of this uncertainty \"human challenge models\" for SARS-CoV-2 have been proposed. This methodology involves the intentional infection of research participants, providing safety data and pointing to immune correlates of protection.

(169,170). The dierence between these bacterial human challenge models and SARS-CoV-2 is that these pathogens have been researched for decades and have an eective antibiotic \"rescue\" treatment available. Infecting a human with SARS- CoV-2 to test vaccine ecacy raises numerous ethical issues (171), including those around informed consent of the healthy volunteer, noting that while severe COVID-19 is less common in young adults, deaths have still occurred in this age group.

High Development Costs and Logistics of Mass-Production It normally takes decades for a vaccine to be developed and licensed for use. However, the race is on to develop a SARS- CoV-2 vaccine for worldwide distribution in an unparalleled timeframe to vaccinate the world's population and providewidespread herd immunity. This is already being facilitated by rapid progression through the normally slow bureaucratic regulatoryandapprovalprocessesandunprecedentedworldwide collaborationbetweengovernments,universities,pharmace utical companies and philanthropic organizations; such eorts must continue. In addition, ensuring good public communication regarding the safety and eectiveness of the vaccine will be key to gaining public trust and acceptance of a vaccine that could be seen as rushed. Additionally, having carefully desi gned post-marketing (phase 4) surveillance is vital to detect rare or unexpected safety signals and AESI which may only be detected oncethevaccineisrolledoutonamassscale. A key player in global access to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is the not-for-prot Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovatio ns (CEPI) which is working with global health authorities and vaccine developers worldwide to support SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development ( 9,174). CEPI was founded in 2017 with the consensus that new and sustainable models of partnership are needed to respond to worldwide infectious diseases threats. FoundingmembersincludetheBill&MelindaGatesFoundation (BMGF), Wellcome trust UK, World Economic Forum, India Department of Biotechnology and the Government of Norway. CEPI's goal is not just to advance development, but to also Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 18 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 579250Flanagan et al. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Progress and Pitfalls advance licensing, manufacturing, delivery and stockpiling of vaccines once an eective vaccine has been developed ( 175). It has raised approximately $1.4 billion for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and initiated a series of partnerships in a bid to advance frontrunner candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. CEPI is investing across a range of vaccine includi ng Novavax's nanoparticle vaccine (NVX-CoV2373 and Matrix- MTM),CloverBiopharma'sS-trimerprotein-basedvaccine(SCB- 2019), University of Queensland's molecular clamp S protein vaccine, University of Oxford's adenovirus 176).Many other government and philanthropic organizations are inject ing large sums of money into the eort to develop eective SARS- CoV-2 vaccines. The European Commission has registered an impressive $8 billion in donations toward the development and deployment of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics agai nst SARS-CoV-2 ( 177). The US government agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has pledged almost $500 million to accelerate the development of Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine, with phase 2 trials expected to begin soon ( 178). BARDA has also vaccine and Novavax's nanoparticle Matrix M adjuvant vaccine ( 179), demonstrating the range of vaccine strategies being supporte d. Importantly, these phase 2/3 studies are being conducted in countries with high disease burden (e.g., North and South America and South Africa), so the vaccine ecacy (VE) and safetyresultscanbeobtainedasrapidlyaspossiblewhilstmee ting thevaccineregulators'requirements. The logistics of scaling up to produce the billions of doses required to immunize the world's population is an onerous task . It is not yet clear how long immunity will last and therefore whether booster doses or annual immunization will be require d. Furthermore, multiple initial doses may be needed and the vaccine may have to change as the virus evolves naturally. BARDAhavepledgedthattheywillscaleupto300millionannual SARS-CoV-2vaccinedosesintheUSeachyearunderOperation Warp Speed, while BMGF have recently awarded $5 million to INOVIO's DNA based vaccine INO-4800 with the intention of providing over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. Novavax has completed phase 1 studies and is progressing rapidly to phase 2 studies,withtheaimofproducingupto100milliondosesbyth e end of 2020 and entering large-scale manufacturing of billio ns of doses in 2021 ( 180). CureVac has a GMP-certied production facilitythatcanproduce10milliondosesoftheirmRNAvaccin e in a single production run and 300 million doses of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1nCoV-19)willbeavailablebyJuly2021( 181). Target Populations and Worldwide Delivery Even if sucient SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses can be manufactured, worldwide delivery presents another major logistic and nancial hurdle. Storage requirements will be enormous and the vaccine may need to be either frozen or refrigerated, presenting cold-chain issues. The decision a boutwhether to prepare the vaccine in single-dose or multi-dose vials will impact manufacturing, storage, delivery and potent ial infection risks ( 182). Infrastructure and manpower will be required to distribute and administer the vaccine. Equity w ill be a major issue since richer countries may procure the vaccin e for their citizens while poorer countries may not be able to aord it. CEPI is negotiating global access upfront in order to ensureequitableaccess,hopefullyaverting\"vaccinenatio nalism\" (183). In early May, WHO launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which aims to handle the logistics of vaccine procurement and allocation ( 184). COVAX, co-led by CEPI, GAVI and WHO, is the vaccine pillar of ACT charged with accelerating vaccine development and manufacture and guaranteeing fair and equitable worldwide access. In an open letter, more than 140 world leaders have united and called for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be freely available to all people in all countries of the world in what they call \"The People's Vaccine, \" whichissurelythefairestwaytotacklethisunprecedentedglo bal pandemic ( 185). By contrast, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine which has been available for 20 years, is still not included in the immunization programs of many countries due to lack of aordability, many children are left unprotected and about ha lf a million deaths from pneumococcal disease each year. Initial ly, as vaccine production commences, it will not be possible to deliver a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to the entire world population and it is anticipated that key vulnerable populations will need to be targeted. These would likely include healthcare workers , the elderly and those with signicant risk factors such as th ose with co-morbidities or the immunocompromised. It might even be used as a travel vaccine as borders re-open across the world , but is unlikely to be incorporated into infant schedules for s ome time given the very low risk of severe disease in that age group andtimeneededtoconductpediatricstudies. CONCLUDING REMARKS While the world eagerly awaits eective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as the solution to ending this pandemic, it should be borne in mind that there are many caveats even if robust SARS-CoV-2- specic nAbs, CD4+and CD8+T cell responses can be induced by vaccination. The number of doses and dosing frequency wil l need to be determined, and, particularly if repeated or annual vaccination is required, the nancial burden and logistics of delivery will have to be supported. A better understanding of what level of nAbs correlate with protection and development of standardized viral neutralization along with other assa ys to compare vaccine candidates is eagerly awaited. Potential di sease enhancement and other theoretical safety concerns related to each type of vaccine need to be understood and carefully monitored for, while potential suboptimal immunity may need to be overcome. Certain vulnerable populations may respond poorlytovaccination,orthevaccinemaypredominantlyprotect against severe disease, rather than infection.
