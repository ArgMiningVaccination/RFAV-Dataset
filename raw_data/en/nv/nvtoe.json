With the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games on the horizon, there are a few things athletes who intend to compete in the Games need to know. To help Sochi-hopefuls understand the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) anti-doping rules, USADA's Olympic Education Team has created a simple way for athletes to remember their rights and responsibilities. Just remember Team U.S.A ...Use your resources: The USADA Sochi 2014 Emergency Phone Line (719-290-8043), available to athletes only during the Olympics and Paralympics, and usada.org/sochi2014 are a few of the resources available to Sochi-bound athletes, coaches, and athlete support staff. The website highlights the IOC and IPC rules for the Games, the dates of the official period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and offers a brief recorded presentation which shows the testing equipment that will be used during the Games. The status of medications can still be checked on www.GlobalDRO.com . Stick with the whereabouts routine: Leading up to and during the Games, athletes should continue to file and update whereabouts as they normally would\u2014including their training schedule and address, competition, room location in the Olympic or Paralympic Village, and other regularly-scheduled activities. Achieve your goals: What an accomplishment it is for athletes to make it to the Olympics or Paralympics! The time and effort put in to reach that goal has not gone unnoticed at USADA so we say congratulations! We are proud to support the clean athletes representing the United States and wish them the best of luck on their true sport journey.

After serving as head trainer at Cy-Fair High School in northwest Houston for thirty years, he retired to become a full-time DCO with USADA. Thomas has been involved with drug testing for the past 17 years, working with the USOC before joining USADA's team. \"I have been fortunate enough to represent the United States as either an athletic trainer or a Doping Control Officer in three Olympic Games,\" said Thomas. \"My first experience came as a trainer at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as part of the medical team. I was also extremely honored to represent USADA as a DCO at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where I served as station manager at the Whistler Sliding Centre. I was also a DCO for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London at Greenwich Park for equestrian and modern pentathlon.\" Thomas says that after being an athlete himself and then working around them as a trainer, he became interested in somehow combining the two as part-time work. \"I never expected it to lead to a full-time job. But I always believed in USADA's vision, mission, and goals, and always strive to uphold those values as a DCO.\" Just as Thomas was unable to predict his career trajectory after college, he continues to encounter many unpredictable moments out in the field. \"Many years ago I attempted an out-of- competition test where the athlete answered the door, let me in, and as we were going through introductions and starting to fill out paperwork, I heard a noise and turned around to see his identical twin brother coming down the stairs! Fortunately for me, the athlete that I had notified pulled out his wallet and provided me with his driver's license. To this day I still wonder what I would have done if neither of them had been carrying identification.\"Thomas is married to his wife of 39 years, Kathy, who serves as his female witnessing chaperone and station marshal. Together they live in Cypress, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Besides sports, his interests include music trivia, fantasy football, and travel. Know Your DCO: Arnold Thomas As Russia's largest resort city and the self- proclaimed longest city in Europe, the city of Sochi stretches 90 miles between the Caucasus Mountains and the Black Sea. A fashionable vacation destination, the city will be the warmest to ever host a Winter Olympics and Paralympics. Average winter temperatures range from 52 \u00b0F during the day to 39 \u00b0F at night from December to March, and organizers have been creating and stockpiling snow at the tops of mountains in case of a shortage when the Games begin in February. To prepare for the influx of visitors, the city has been constructing a new light rail metro system as well as building or modernizing four thermal power plants and four hydroelectric plants. In addition to being the warmest setting for a Winter Games, Sochi will also lay claim to being the most-tested Winter Olympics, as well. About 2,500 doping tests are planned for the Winter Olympics, up immensely from the 2,149 tests conducted in Vancouver 2010. Overseeing those tests will be a staff of 570 (Vancouver had 500), working at 13 different doping control stations at the competition facilities and Olympic Villages. Even before winning the bid for the XXII Olympic Winter Games in 2007, Sochi has boasted a proud sporting history. Two multi-Grand Slam winning and former world no. 1 ranked tennis players, Maria Sharapova and Yevgeny Kafelnikov, began their careers at a local tennis academy. The area's future will continue to be prosperous even after the Games\u2014the Olympic Stadium will also be used as a host stadium for the 2018 World Cup, and a deal was recently reached for Formula 1's Russian Grand Prix to take place there in 2014. The city of 350,000 also has plenty of attractions outside of sporting venues. On the Western edge of the city sits the Friendship Tree, a citrus tree grown from buds planted by representatives from all around the world as an experiment to try and grow a new type of fruit. The tree is contained within the Friendship Tree Garden Museum, which is home to plants, fruit, and flowers from over 80 different botanical families. SPIRIT OF SPORT\u00aeA Public Service Announcement VOLUME 13 / ISSUE 2 Page 3Ask The Scientists! ? Q: Since hemp comes from the marijuana plant, does it THC in it? Is it prohibited? A: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the active component in marijuana (e.g., hashish, pot, weed, etc.) which comes from the marijuana plant (Cannabis sativa) and produces the \"high.\" THC is prohibited in-competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). When an athlete is tested in-competition, their urine is screened for the presence of THC. There are many nutritional products on the market that advertise to contain hemp, hemp seed oil, or other parts of the marijuana plant. Since it is plant-based, hemp protein is marketed as a good source of protein for vegans. It is also appearing in more mainstream food products such as some brands of yogurt. Under ideal circumstances, the parts of the plant used for hemp (the stem and seeds) do not contain THC. Most growers of hemp purposely grow plants low in THC concentration so that they can harvest the stems, oil, and seeds without worrying about legal issues around THC content. However, some stems and seeds that are harvested for the hemp protein do contain detectable amounts of THC. Furthermore, some hemp suppliers are not always careful about the part of the plant that they harvest, or even which plant they harvest. Hemp suppliers do not always test their products for THC content so they may not realize they are selling hemp with detectable levels. Athletes need to be aware that while some papers show that the likelihood of testing positive from a hemp product (at least in workplace testing) is very low1, there are at least two peer-reviewed articles that show it is possible to sometimes detect THC in the urine of people who have consumed hemp products2,3. Athletes who choose to consume hemp products may be at risk for a positive anti-doping test, even though many of these products claim not to contain THC. Thus, the risk of testing positive from hemp is low, but nonetheless it may be possible. Because athletes are strictly liable for what is in their systems, irrespective of how it got there, it is very important to be aware of this possibility.There are many factors that influence whether THC is detectable in a urine sample which may lead to a positive test, such as the time of the test in relation to consumption of the substance, concentration of THC in the hemp product, and the weight and metabolic rate of the individual. Just because one athlete uses a hemp product, is tested, and receives a negative result does not mean that another athlete could not test positive using the exact same product. The consumption of products containing hemp is at the athlete's own risk. For those athletes also enlisted in the military, some services have strict rules about consuming hemp. They will need to contact a representative at their service branch for more information. References 1. Leson, G., Pless, P., Grotenhermen, F., Kalant, H. and ElSohly, M. A.

One of the videos features USA Boxing National Team member Cam F. Awesome. Formerly known as Lenroy Thompson, Awesome was suspended by USADA prior to the London Olympics in 2012 for failing to submit accurate whereabouts so that he could be located for out-of-competition drug testing. In the video, Cam shares his comeback story and emphasizes the importance and ease of submitting whereabouts. The videos will be shown during educational presentations to athletes around the country, and are also available online in the athlete area of of USADA's website. Who Said it... ?\"Striving for maximum results in an attempt to find the best in you is rare. In regular, everyday life, only sports and a true focus on maximizing results can provide the type of introspective self-assessment needed to really know who you are as a person. Through sports, I found myself - who I am, what I like, and how I learn.\" (Answer on Page 6)Every October, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) releases updates and changes to the Prohibited List for the following calendar year. Below is a summary of the major changes to the List for 2014. The entire list of Prohibited Substances and Methods can be found at http://www.usada.org/prohibited-list/. PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES Use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN) With the assistance of the World Health Organization, the nomenclature of some substances on the List has been updated to International Non-proprietary Names (INN). For ease of the reviewer, the previous name has been included and no substance has been deleted: S1. Anabolic Agents Changes were made to the definitions of \"exogenous\" and \"endogenous\" for purposes of clarification and accuracy.S2. Peptide Hormones, Growth Factors and Related Substances Releasing factors are prohibited and that is made clear in points S2.2, S2.3 and S2.4. In addition other prohibited growth factors are listed separately. S5. Diuretics and other Masking Agents Vasopressin V2 antagonists (vaptans) were added as an example of a diuretic subclass. M1. Manipulation of Blood and Blood Components For the purpose of scientific accuracy, the term allogenic was introduced. SUBSTANCES AND METHODS PROHIBITED IN-COMPETITION S6. Stimulants: Some drugs that metabolize to amphetamine or methamphetamine have been reclassified because improved analytical techniques permit the identification of the administered drug and corresponding metabolites; MDMA and MDA are reclassified because they are now recognized as less likely to be used as doping agents; cathinone and its analogues (e.g. mephedrone, methedrone, pyrrolidinovalerophenone) and trimetazidine have been added as examples to reflect emerging patterns of drug use. SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED IN PARTICULAR SPORTS P1. Alcohol Changes were made to the wording describing the blood alcohol threshold, in the interest of accuracy. MONITORING PROGRAM In order to detect potential patterns of abuse, mitragynine has been added to the Narcotics class of the Monitoring Program. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the human placenta, and it is a substance prohibited (for males) in sport at all times. For decades, it has been illegally marketed and sold as a weight loss product on the Internet and, according to a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) press release, through mainstream retailers. Recently, six companies marketing hCG as a safe and natural weight loss product received warning letters from the FDA [1] because the products are actually illegal drugs. One company is being sued by the FTC in federal court [2]. Athletes need to be aware of the risks involved in using products marketed as dietary supplements, or in this case, as homeopathic remedies. There are many unexpected ways athletes might encounter substances prohibited in sport. Please be vigilant of fraudulent, illegal products. Dietary supplements can contain prohibited substances which increase the risk of an anti-doping rule violation, or can be potentially harmful to your health.SPIRIT OF SPORT\u00ae Heed the hCGSummary of Major Modifications to the 2014 Prohibited List Page 4 Image Source: [2] 1.

USADA does have a published list of supplements that contain prohibited substances on www.Supplement411.org , however, those results only come after extensive lab research and testing. The High Risk List results only come through small-batch testing, meaning that two separate batches of an identical supplement could yield completely different test results. Essentially, the current regulatory structure doesn't stop supplement companies from putting in whatever they want. Because of this, taking dietary supplements carries a significant risk as an athlete. Myth: American professional sports leagues and the NCAA are under USADA's jurisdiction USADA conducts the anti-doping programs for all Olympic, Paralympic, Pan-American and Parapan American sport in the United States. USADA does not have jurisdiction over the testing programs for MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL or the NCAA. All of those organizations conduct their own drug-testing programs. There may be overlap if an athlete is competing for Team USA in addition to their normal activity (for example, when an NBA player is playing for USA Basketball in the Olympic Games). Myth: USADA is affiliated with the federal government USADA is not part of the federal government, and operates as an independent non-profit entity. They are, however, recognized by the United States Congress as the country's official anti-doping agency. Additionally, the United States government has ratified the UNESCO Anti-Doping Convention which signifies the country's commitment to clean competition and global harmonization of anti-doping initiatives, a commitment that is upheld in a significant way by USADA.Becoming the first American woman to win gold medals at both the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games is an amazing achievement. Doing it after a setback like Alana Nichols's is almost implausible. A product of Farmington, New Mexico, Nichols was a star volleyball and softball athlete in high school on her way to a full-ride athletics scholarship. However, her dreams of collegiate sports stardom were abruptly altered on November 19, 2000. Nichols and a group of friends were snowboarding in the Colorado backcountry, practicing backflips on makeshift jumps. She had executed the stunt numerous times on land and trampolines, but this particular attempt she over-rotated her body, landing on a slab of rock that was hidden beneath the snow. Alana's body 'tacoed' over the boulder, the impact injuring her T11 vertebrae and breaking the T10 and T12 in half. She then had to endure a two-hour wait in the snow for rescuers and first responders to arrive. \"It's hard to find words for what it meant to be paralyzed,\" said Nichols. \"It wasn't so much the pain, but trying to process it all. It took a while to wrap my head around it\u2014I went through two years of mourning my loss.\" After years of physical therapy, her life began to feel whole again when she discovered the sport of wheelchair basketball. Although she was unfamiliar with adaptive sports, Nichols was immediately hooked after watching a five-on-five game on campus at the University of Arizona. After first sitting in a chair for the sport, her natural sporting instincts came rushing back and she quickly became the best player on the team. Nichols was ready to live again through sport, and her drive would lead her and the rest of Team USA to gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Soon after, she was ready to return to the mountain and turned her attention to alpine skiing. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver she medaled in four different disciplines, winning gold in downhill sitting and giant slalom sitting. This feat allows her to lay claim to being the first American woman to win gold at both a Summer and Winter Paralympic Games. But her biggest takeaways from her Paralympic successes have nothing to do with medals, records, or prizes. \"I'm so glad to have gained a respect for other cultures and a broader perspective of people around the world,\" said Nichols. \"I feel fortunate to live in the United States where people with disabilities and adaptive sports are not only respected, but celebrated.\" She says she would like to spread that goodwill to communities of children in underprivileged nations someday. \"I've always wanted the chance to give back to the sport that meant so much to me, and to work with others as part of a non-profit group to share my love for sport with others.\" Before that, however, she has at least one more athletic endeavor she would like to pursue: surfing. \"It's not a Paralympic sport yet, but it could be someday. I love the ocean and always find a place for it in my life.\" In preparation for competing in all five alpine skiing disciplines (downhill, slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and combined) at Sochi, Alana has been living and training at the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center.

Alabama law enforcement officials raided the headquarters of S.W.A.T.S (Sports with Alternative to Steroids) Fitness and Performance in September 2013, based on claims that the company made about a number of products that were unsupported by scientific research. Some of these products were marketed as \"dietary supplements.\" One in particular, the \"Ultimate Spray,\" was advertised as a liposomal preparation of deer antler velvet intended for absorption under the tongue (sublingual). Liposomes are similar to fat droplets that more effectively carry a drug through, in this case, the tissues under the tongue. Deer antler velvet is ground-up material obtained from antlers that is harvested before they harden. S.W.A.T.S further claimed that the active ingredient in the \"Ultimate Spray\" was insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a substance banned both in- and out-of- competition on the WADA Prohibited List. S.W.A.T.S first came into the public eye thanks to a January 2013 Sports Illustrated story. In the article, the directors of S.W.A.T.S claimed that various high-profile professional and collegiate athletes were using their products, which included \"negatively-charged\" water, \"concussion caps,\" and \"holographic performance chips.\" To stay up on the latest science, USADA has an internal research program and is also a partner in the Partnership for Clean Competition (PCC). The PCC was founded in 2008 by USADA along with the United States Olympic Committee, the National Football League, and Major League Baseball. A working group consisting of five international laboratories developed a liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometric assay for IGF-1. IGF-1 is comprised of a chain of 70 amino acids in a specific sequence which, using mass spectrometry, can be determined. The Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory (SMRTL) in Salt Lake City, which was part of the USADA/PCC IGF-1 Working Group, tested the Ultimate Spray and found IGF-1 to have an amino acid sequence consistent of human or cow origin, but could not detect any IGF-1 with the sequence of amino acids from deer. The reason it is not possible to distinguish human IGF-1 from cow IGF-1 is that the sequence of amino acids is identical. Interestingly, no IGF-1 was detected in a Chinese traditional medicine preparation of deer antler velvet, either. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, and their extracts and concentrates. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken the position that dietary supplements are also intended to be ingested via the intestinal tract - thus placing sublingual sprays, cr\u00e8mes, and other drug delivery systems in the category of \"new drugs.\" Since deer antlers do not fall within the above definition and a sublingual spray qualifies the product as a \"new drug,\" S.W.A.T.S was presumably in violation of multiple FDA regulations, although the FDA never sent S.W.A.T.S a warning letter regarding their products. One of the frequently-discussed issues with DSHEA is the lack of funding for enforcement, particularly because companies are not required to register their products with the FDA in advance of their manufacturing. Due to this inconsistent enforcement, USADA frequently tests supplements for prohibited substances. Ones that have been found to contain prohibited substances, even in trace amounts, are listed on the \"USADA High Risk List\" on the Supplement411.org website. The site also offers information pertaining to the industry and advice on making wise consumer decisions regarding dietary supplements. USADA also provides the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) with information regarding its supplement testing results and research.SPIRIT OF SPORT\u00ae Page 6 USADA's TrueSport Coaching Education program has reached the gold standard of excellence by being awarded accreditation from the National Council for Accreditation of Coaching Education (NCACE) at Level 3 Domain 1 - Philosophy and Ethics. To date, the TrueSport Coaching Education Program is one of just over 20 programs nationally, including youth sport, high school, and institutions of higher education, to have been accredited by NCACE. NCACE grants accreditation to educational programs that meet or exceed requirements based on the National Standards for Sport Coaches developed by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE). The National Standards for Sport Coaches provide the fundamental competencies that athletic coaches from beginning coach to master coach should possess to ensure the safety and quality of athletic programs. \"This external accreditation is important in demonstrating USADA's and TrueSport's commitment to the importance of prepared and qualified coaches in the U.S. With research showing that coaches are one of the most significant influences in young athletes' lives, quality and effective training and education programs are essential in equipping coaches to maximize their impact on and off the playing field,\" says Anais Spitzer, Ph.D., TrueSport Managing Strategist. \"We are gratified to have met the stringent requirements and to have been honored with this important accreditation to validate and advance our efforts in coaching education.\" The TrueSport Coaching Education Program is a web-based, self-guided learning platform tailored to adult learners that utilizes engaging, interactive and practical instructional tools.
