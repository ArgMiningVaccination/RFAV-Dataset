The literature review surveyed scholarly articles, books , and other sources (e.g. , dissertations, conference proceedings ) with the following question in mind : 'What are the key elements for collaboration between health authorities and public health units to improve the health system using a population health approach?' Methods The team used a mixed method approach utilizing a narrative review with a thematic analysis to describe key points. The team performed a limited scoping search according to the following stages: Stage 1: Clarify and link the purpose of the review and research question Stage 2: Balance feasibility with breadth and comprehensiveness of the process Stage 3: Utilize inclusion / exclusion criteria to screen and select studies (Figure 1) Stage 4: Extract data from selected studies using conceptual categories Stage 5: Consu lt with stakeholders to identify additional publications and/or research in -progress The search was restricted to articles published from 2006 to present, after the implementation of the Local Health System Integration Act in 2006 . The following databases and journal were searched : 1. Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print, In -Process & Other Non -Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to Present 2. Embase 1996 to 2017 Week 45 - Excluding Medline Journals 3. EBSCOhost Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 4. EBSCOhost CINHAL 5. EBSCOhost Health Business Elite 6.
