ScienceAlert reports: The finger of blame is pointed squarely at the sugar [trehalose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose#:~:text=Trehalose%20(from%20Turkish%20't%C4%B1gala',freezing%20and%20lack%20of%20water.), found in foods such as nutrition bars and chewing gum. If the findings are confirmed, it's a stark warning that even apparently harmless additives have the potential to cause health issues when introduced to our food supply. In this case, trehalose is being linked with the rise of two strains of the bacterium Clostridium difficile, capable of causing diarrhea, colitis, organ failure, and even death. The swift rise of the antibiotic-resistant bug has become a huge problem for hospitals in recent years, and the timing matches up with the arrival of trehalose. \"In 2000, trehalose was approved as a food additive in the United States for a number of foods from sushi and vegetables to ice cream,\" [said one of the researchers](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/bcom-dsl010318.php), Robert Britton from the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, back in January 2018. \"About three years later the reports of outbreaks with these lineages started to increase. Other factors may also contribute, but we think that trehalose is a key trigger.\" The C. difficile lineages Britton is referring to are RT027 and RT078.
