This vaccine is used to protect people aged 18 years and older against COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by a virus called coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). VAXZEVRIA stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). It causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19 in the future. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19. 2. What should I know before I am given VAXZEVRIA? Warnings You should not receive VAXZEVRIA if you: - Are allergic to this vaccine or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Always check the ingredients to make sure you can use this vaccine. - Have had a major blood clot occurring at the same time as having low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia) after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. - Have had capillary leak syndrome (CLS; a condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels). Check with your healthcare provider before vaccination if: - You have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given VAXZEVRIA in the past; - Your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or cancer medicines); - You currently have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C); - You have ever had a blood clot in the past or if you have an autoimmune disorder (illness where the body's immune system attacks its own cells) including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP; previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura); - You have ever had a serious medical condition (heparin induced thrombocytopenia; HIT) where your blood platelet levels became very low (thrombocytopenia) after taking heparin (a blood thinning medicine) - You have a problem with bleeding or bruising, or if you are taking a blood thinning medicine (anticoagulant); - You have ever had capillary leak syndrome (CLS; a condition causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels) - You have ever fainted or felt stressed (eg dizziness, increased heart rate, difficulty in breathing, sweating, tingling feeling and/or feeling anxious) when you have been given an injection including other vaccines. - You have any other medical conditions - You take any medicines for any other condition including any recent or planned vaccines Blood disorders Very rare cases of blood clots with low levels of blood platelets have been observed following vaccination with VAXZEVRIA. The majority of these cases occurred within the first 21 days following vaccination but have also been reported after this period. Some had a fatal outcome. Blood clots, including clots in the brain, not associated with low levels of blood platelets have been observed following vaccination with VAXZEVRIA. However, it has not been determined whether these events were due to the vaccine. Some had a fatal outcome. Very low levels of blood platelets (immune thrombocytopenia), that can be associated with bleeding, have been reported very rarely, usually within the first four weeks following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Seek urgent medical attention if from a few days following vaccination you: - Experience a severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures (fits) - Develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain or persistent abdominal pain - Notice unusual skin bruising or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination After vaccination you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under [Section 6. Are there any side effects?](#s6) Pregnancy and breastfeeding Check with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. There are limited data on the use of VAXZEVRIA in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Your healthcare provider will discuss with you whether you can be given the vaccine. Children and adolescents No data are currently available on the use of VAXZEVRIA in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age. 3. What if I am taking, have recently taken or might take other medicines or vaccines? Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take, any other vaccines or medicines including any medicines, vitamins or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Medicines (including other vaccines) that may impact whether you should be given this vaccine or not include the following (see also [Section 2](#s2) above): - medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or cancer medicines); - blood thinning medicines (anticoagulant) - any other vaccine including any other COVID-19 vaccines Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure about what vaccines, medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking or have recently taken and if these may affect VAXZEVRIA. 4. How am I given VAXZEVRIA? How VAXZEVRIA is given VAXZEVRIA will be given to you by a healthcare provider. It is injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). You will receive 2 (0.5 mL per dose) injections. You will be told when you need to return for your second injection of VAXZEVRIA. The second injection can be given between 4 and 12 weeks after the first injection. When VAXZEVRIA is given for the first injection, VAXZEVRIA (and not another vaccine against COVID-19) should be given for the second injection to complete vaccination course. If you forget to get your second injection If you forget to go back at the scheduled time, ask your healthcare provider for advice. It is important that you return for your second injection of VAXZEVRIA. If you miss a scheduled second injection you may not achieve maximum protection. You may receive a booster injection of VAXZEVRIA. The booster injection may be given at least 6 months after the second injection. If you use too much VAXZEVRIA As VAXZEVRIA is given under the close supervision of a healthcare provider it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If you are concerned that you have been given too much VAXZEVRIA, tell your healthcare provider immediately. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know about being given VAXZEVRIA? As with any vaccine, VAXZEVRIA may not protect everyone who is vaccinated from COVID-19. It is not yet known how long people who receive the vaccine will be protected for. Driving or using machines Be careful before you drive or use any machines or tools until you know how this vaccine affects you. VAXZEVRIA has no known effect on the ability to drive and use machines. However, side effects listed in [section 6](#s6) may impact your ability to drive and use machines. If you feel unwell, do not drive or use machines. Looking after your vaccine Your healthcare provider is responsible for storing this vaccine and disposing of any unused product correctly. 6. Are there any side effects? All vaccines can have side effects. If you do experience any side effects, most of them are mild to moderate in nature and resolve within a few days. Fewer side effects were reported after the second dose However, some side effects may need medical attention. After vaccination, you may have more than one side effect at the same time (for example, muscle pain/ache, joint pain, headaches, chills and generally feeling unwell).
