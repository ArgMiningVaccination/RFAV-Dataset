This is a n increase of $423.8 million in total funding and a n increase of $ 737.2 million in state funding from the revised current year 2018-2019 spending estimates . Federal revenue is decreasing by $210.7 million, dep artmental revenue is decreasing by $11.4 million, and capital and highway construction bonds are decreasing by $ 91.3 million. The estimate for higher education student tuition and fees remains the same. Mid-year review of state tax collections and advice from economists and the State Funding Board suggest that current -year estimates of taxes collected by the Department of Revenue show modest growth . The revised recurring current -year growth rate in the general fund is 2.35 percent compared with the actual 2017-2018 Department of Revenue collections. For fiscal year 2019- 2020, before inter -fund reallocations, general fund taxes are expected to grow by $393.1 million above the revised current -year estimate. This is a 3.21 percent general fund growth rate above the revised current -year estimate. Revenue growth rates are within the range of revenue growth recommended by the State Funding Board. The revised revenue estimates for the current year and estimates for next year are based on a steady economic gro wth through fiscal year 2019-2020 and beyond. Plan for Balancing General fund supplemental appropriations in the current 2018-2019 fiscal year total $ 36.1 million, $21.9 million of which is in the Bureau of TennCare to fund increasing program costs in the Department of Children's Services. Additional programs requiring supplemental appropriations include $2.7 million for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, $1.7 million for the Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Fund, $5 million in the Department of Children's Services for additional costs pertaining to an increase in the number of children in state custody, $2.4 million to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to correct a revenue under collection problem, $890,000 for state legal expenses, $750,000 for the E lectronic Monitoring Indigency F und, $500,000 for improvements to the water system in Pikeville, and a $250,000 operating supplement to the Attorney General. In fiscal year 201 9-2020, the budget is balanced, with recurring revenues fully supporting recurring appropriations. This is accomplished by additional budget reductions in fiscal year 2019-2020. Base budgets in general fund programs throughout state government have been reduced by $42.3 million in the general fund. The avera ge general fund recurring reduction is 0.7 percent. A total of 37 positions will be reduced as a result of reductions implemented in this budget recommendation. (The reductions are detailed in Volume 2: Base Budget Reductions .) xix xix State of Tennessee Budget Highlights Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 The total recommended state budget for fiscal year 2019-2020 is $38.6 billion, with $ 18.6 billion from state appropriations ; $14 billion from federal funds ; $3.9 billion from other departmental revenues ; $1.9 billion from higher education student tuition a nd fees ; and $124 million in bonds.

Additional programs requiring supplemental appropriations include $2.7 million for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, $1.7 million for the Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Fund, $5 million in the Department of Children's Services for additional costs pertaining to an increase in the number of children in state custody, $2.4 million to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation to correct a revenue under collection problem, $890,000 for state legal expenses, $750,000 for the E lectronic Monitoring Indigency F und, $500,000 for improvements to the water system in Pikeville, and a $250,000 operating supplement to the Attorney General.

A total of 37 positions will be reduced as a result of reductions implemented in this budget recommendation. (The reductions are detailed in Volume 2: Base Budget Reductions .) xx xxBudget Highlights Federal and State Mandate s State expenditures in the TennCare program are matched according to a rate set by the federal government known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government determines this rate for all states based on changes in per -capit a income. For fiscal year 201 9-2020, federal participation in certain healthcare programs is decreasing from 6 5.858 percent to 65.375 percent . This creates shortfalls of $41.4 million in state funding in TennCare, $713,400 in CoverKids, and $734,500 in t he Department of Children's Services for foster care and adoption assistance. A total of $42.8 million offsets the loss of federal funding in those programs. A total of $ 7.5 million in state funding is required to pay salary increases mandated by state law for certain job classifications within state government. These jobs and the state dollars necessary to fund the required increase s include state judges ($ 1,004,500), the attorney g eneral ($ 5,900), assistant district attorneys and criminal investigator s ($1.4 million ), assistant public defenders and criminal investigators ($ 744,700), public defender offices in Shelby and Davidson counties ($187,800), assistant post -conviction defenders ($33,000), the governor ($6,000), trooper step increases ($ 1.2 million) and border- state survey ($ 1.4 million ), and wildlife officer step increases ($580,000) and border- state survey ($ 804,400). State sta tutes mandate that teachers at state -run schools must be compensated based on their training and experience. To fund t his requirement , $11,800 is provided to the Department of Children's Services for the Youth Development schools and $113,800 in the Department of Education for state special schools. K-12 Education For K -12 education, the cost to maintain full funding of the Basic Education Program (BEP) formula, which provides an equitable state share of K -12 public education funding to L ocal Education A gencies (LEAs) , is $46.2 million . To further support teachers and students, the a dministration recommends a n appropriation of $71.3 million in salary increases for teachers and other positions funded through the BEP formula , effective July 1, 2019. The amount of the salary increases will depend on each LEA's salary schedule and structure, but if applied across -the-board, this would be a 2.5% salary increase. In response to an increased need for services to families with children with disabilities or developmental delays, $3 million of recurring appropriations matches $5 million in federal funding and 65 new positions will be added to the program. A non- recurring $5 million is recommended to support student services and scholastic improvement within the lowest performing 5 percent of schools. Budget Highlig hts To support professional development for educators and school leaders through t he Office of Educator Licensure and Preparation (OLEP) program, two positions and $227,000 recurring funding are recommended. A non- recurring investment of $500,000 is recommended to support professional development of rural principals and expansion of the Rural Principal Network. Non-recurring funding of $1.5 million is recommended for Teach For America, which recruits college graduates to serve as teachers in low -income communities across the state. The Governor's Civics Initiative to recognize public schools and districts implementing high -quality civic education programs that result in readiness for college, career, and life is funded with $500,000 non- recurring. To strengthen and promote student choice, $12 million non- recurring is recommended for t he Charter Schools Facilities fund to assist public charter schools in acquiring and improving property. Education Savings Accounts are funded with a recurring $25.3 million appropriation and non-recurring of $200,000 for program set-up and management. An additional $30 million is provided to the Local Education Agencies for school safety grants. Of that amount, $20 million is non- recurring. Also in the Department of Education's budget recommendation is $2.8 million recurring for the ACT Senior Retake O pportunity, The total amount of new funding requested for K-12 education is $211.1 million. New Workforce Development Initiatives The administration recommends several new initiatives that will increase career options available to children and adults and provide the skills needed for meaningful, gainful employment. The Governor's Investment in Vocational Education (GIVE) is funded in the Tennessee Higher Education Commission's (THEC's) budget recommendation with $25 million in non- recurring funds for grants to community partnerships of K -12, higher education institutions, and local industry. The initiative aims to eliminate skills gaps in a proactive, data -driven, and coordinated manner by encouraging collaboration across education and industry . A re curring appropriation of $4 million from lottery funds will be used for dual enrollment courses for trade and technical programs for high school juniors and seniors. T he Supporting Postsecondary Access in Rural Communities (SPARC) initiative is funded with $2 million non- recurring . The appropriation will be used to provide career and technical education ( CTE) equipment and instruction in rural distressed counties. The Governor's Future Workforce Initiative will provide technical assistance to school dist ricts and establish new training and professional development resources for educators and instructors. An appropriation of $1.1 million in the recommendation for the Department of Education will be used to expand science, technology, engineering, and math ( STEM ) programs statewide. The expansion will include additional computer science courses and standards training, STEM -xxi xxi Budget Highlights Federal and State Mandate s State expenditures in the TennCare program are matched according to a rate set by the federal government known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP).

State of Tennessee The Budget Document Introduction Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 9-4- 5106, requires that the financial plan of Tennessee's state government be presented in three parts: 1. Financial Policy - The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures and revenues from all sources that are estimated for the ensuing fiscal year, with the corresponding figures for the latest completed fiscal year and the fiscal year in progress, and a budget summary; 2. Detailed Budget Estimates - Estimates of expenditures and revenues, including all funding sources; program statements; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 3. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills - The General Appropriations Bill, through which the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and funds the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expenditures are financed also are detailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed. Parts one and two are included in the Budget D ocument. The format of the Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part three , the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents.

In the TennCare program, an upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 201 4-2015 to 2017-2018 is continued in fiscal years 201 8-2019 and 2019-2020. The increases in 201 8-2019 and 2019-2020 are largely due to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information system s, and i ncreased utilization of a waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees. The impacts to the TennCa re budget are displayed elsewhere in this budget. Significant Federal Funding Program Actions - 2009 to 2019 In February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). From state fiscal year 2008 -2009 to 2013-2014, ARRA awarded over $6 billion to the State of Tennessee. The funds awarded included enhanced Medicaid matching funds, grants to Local Education Agencies, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps) benefits, special education grants, and infrastructure grants for highways and bridges. Also, the State of Tennessee applied for and won a $500 million multi -year grant in 2010 to improve educational outcomes as a part of the Race to the Top program outlined in ARRA. This funding was fully obligated by June 30, 2014. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was designed to provide for an increase in the federal debt limit while reducing long -term budget deficits. Most significantly for the states, the act established spending caps on discretionary spending programs through federal fiscal year 2021 and included automatic procedures to reduce spending over a 10- year period by over $1.2 trillion. The automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, were triggered on January 2, 2013 and effective March 1, 2013. As a result, 242 state-administered federal programs in Tennessee were reduced $71.8 million for fiscal year 2013 -2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act s of 2015 and 2018 raised the discretionary program spending caps in federal fiscal years 2016 , 2017 and 2018, while also extending the imposition of sequestration spending caps beyond 2021 to federal fiscal year 2027. As a result, there we re no additional sequestration reductions of federally funded programs in state fiscal years 2016-2017 or 2017-2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, was passed by Congress in February 2019 to fund the federal government until September 30, 2019. The spending caps in th is law are subject to the discretionary program spending caps first described in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook For fiscal year 201 9-2020, increased f ederal aid is recommended largely in the TennCare program. Of the total cost increase from federal sources of $287 ,906,400 , the share directed to the TennCare program is $255,137,700. A factor increasing the federal aid estimate in both the TennCare and Department of Children's Services budgets is the addition of federal funds due to a n increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is the rate at which the federal government matches state appropriation expenditures in the programs. The FMAP formula measures a state's personal income relative to the nation. The re vised FMAP decreased fiscal year 201 9-2020 federal funding by $42,119,600 in TennCare and the Department of Children's Services. State appropriations cost increases are recommended to offset this re duction of federal funds. State of Tennessee Tennessee Economic Overview Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 Tennessee's fiscal environment depends on economic conditions that influence both the expenditure and revenue sides of the state budget. The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current eco nomic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \" An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" The national and state economies experienced healthy economic growth in 2018, buoyed by strong fundamentals and federal tax cuts .Tax cuts and economic momentum helped generate a 6.9 percent gain in business fixed investment for the national economy. Perhaps the best indication of the streng th of the economy is the labor market. Nonfarm and manufacturing job growth advanced at a healthy pace for both the nation aland state economies. The state unemployment rate settled at a remarkably low 3.5 percent rate in 2018, while the national unemplo yment rate was 3.9 percent for the year. Global growth slowed some over the year, but remained relatively strong helping domestic economic performance. The state and national economies are expected to see sustained growth in 2019 and 2020, though rates o f growth are expected to slow. This is not a recessionary outlook, but one that recognizes that the economy is confronting the constraints of full employment and other headwinds. The discussion that follows provides additional background on current eco nomic conditions and the economic outlook for the state and nation to help frame the state's fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S .and Tennessee, see \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee .\" Recent Economic Conditions U.S. inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) had a strong showing in 2018, with a gain of 2.9 percent, matching the rate of growth in 2015. Consumer durable goods spending and business fixed invest ment helped drive GDP growth. A small setback in residential investment and strong import growth dampened overall growth for the year. Nonfarm employment was up 1.6 percent and manufacturing employment surged 2.1 percent. December was noteworthy for job gains well in excess of 300 thousand. Inflation remained moderate, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.5 percent. The re are emerging signs of wage gains after years of earnings stagnation. This signal, along with overall strong economic conditions, c aused the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate, largely consistent with market expectations. The federal funds rate averaged just 1.8 percent for the year. Economic conditions in Tennessee continued to show marked improvement. State inflation - adjusted GPD was up 2.7 percent for the year while nominal personal income saw a 4.3 percent gain, slightly below the national rate of income growth. While the unemployment rate has drifted up from the remarkably low 3.0 percent rate in September of 2017, it remains low with an average of 3.5 percent for 2018. Nonfarm job s were up 1.8 percent, roughly on par with gains from the previous year. Employment in the state's manufacturing sector slowed to 1.0 percent following 1.4 percent growth in 2017. Short -Term Economic Outlook If the economy remains on track, by mid -year this will be the longest economic expansion in the historical record. The economic outlook for 201 9 and 20 20 calls for slowing growth. A primary consideration is that the economy is operating at full employment, as indicated by record low unemployment rates. There is simply little capacity for economic acceleration. In addition, the influence of federal tax cuts will fade as 2019 unfolds. Other headwinds include tariff wars, rising interest rates, an appreciating dollar, and closure of the federal government. A recession is not expected as economic fundamentals remain strong. U.S. inflation -adjusted GDP is expected to be up 2.7 percent in 201 9 followed by slower growth o f 2.1 percent in the following year. Employment growth will slow to 1.5 percent in 2019 and to just 1.1 percent in 2020, reflecting a scarcity of available workers. The U.S. unemployment rate A-49 From fiscal year s 2014-2015 to 2017-2018, non- TennCare federal funding trended slightly downward due to the expiration of non- recurring sources, with estimated funding in fis cal years 2018- 2019 and 2019-2020 above fiscal year 201 7-2018 actual levels. In the TennCare program, an upward trend in federal funding from fiscal years 201 4-2015 to 2017-2018 is continued in fiscal years 201 8-2019 and 2019-2020. The increases in 201 8-2019 and 2019-2020 are largely due to medical inflation and utilization in the program, continued implementation of information system s, and i ncreased utilization of a waiver for intellectually and developmentally disabled enrollees.

This funding was fully obligated by June 30, 2014. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was designed to provide for an increase in the federal debt limit while reducing long -term budget deficits. Most significantly for the states, the act established spending caps on discretionary spending programs through federal fiscal year 2021 and included automatic procedures to reduce spending over a 10- year period by over $1.2 trillion. The automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, were triggered on January 2, 2013 and effective March 1, 2013. As a result, 242 state-administered federal programs in Tennessee were reduced $71.8 million for fiscal year 2013 -2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act s of 2015 and 2018 raised the discretionary program spending caps in federal fiscal years 2016 , 2017 and 2018, while also extending the imposition of sequestration spending caps beyond 2021 to federal fiscal year 2027. As a result, there we re no additional sequestration reductions of federally funded programs in state fiscal years 2016-2017 or 2017-2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, was passed by Congress in February 2019 to fund the federal government until September 30, 2019. The spending caps in th is law are subject to the discretionary program spending caps first described in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook For fiscal year 201 9-2020, increased f ederal aid is recommended largely in the TennCare program. Of the total cost increase from federal sources of $287 ,906,400 , the share directed to the TennCare program is $255,137,700. A factor increasing the federal aid estimate in both the TennCare and Department of Children's Services budgets is the addition of federal funds due to a n increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is the rate at which the federal government matches state appropriation expenditures in the programs. The FMAP formula measures a state's personal income relative to the nation. The re vised FMAP decreased fiscal year 201 9-2020 federal funding by $42,119,600 in TennCare and the Department of Children's Services. State appropriations cost increases are recommended to offset this re duction of federal funds. State of Tennessee Tennessee Economic Overview Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 Tennessee's fiscal environment depends on economic conditions that influence both the expenditure and revenue sides of the state budget. The Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current eco nomic conditions and expectations for short -term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \" An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" The national and state economies experienced healthy economic growth in 2018, buoyed by strong fundamentals and federal tax cuts .Tax cuts and economic momentum helped generate a 6.9 percent gain in business fixed investment for the national economy. Perhaps the best indication of the streng th of the economy is the labor market. Nonfarm and manufacturing job growth advanced at a healthy pace for both the nation aland state economies. The state unemployment rate settled at a remarkably low 3.5 percent rate in 2018, while the national unemplo yment rate was 3.9 percent for the year. Global growth slowed some over the year, but remained relatively strong helping domestic economic performance. The state and national economies are expected to see sustained growth in 2019 and 2020, though rates o f growth are expected to slow. This is not a recessionary outlook, but one that recognizes that the economy is confronting the constraints of full employment and other headwinds. The discussion that follows provides additional background on current eco nomic conditions and the economic outlook for the state and nation to help frame the state's fiscal outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. For more information on the economic outlook for the U.S .and Tennessee, see \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee .\" Recent Economic Conditions U.S. inflation -adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) had a strong showing in 2018, with a gain of 2.9 percent, matching the rate of growth in 2015. Consumer durable goods spending and business fixed invest ment helped drive GDP growth. A small setback in residential investment and strong import growth dampened overall growth for the year. Nonfarm employment was up 1.6 percent and manufacturing employment surged 2.1 percent. December was noteworthy for job gains well in excess of 300 thousand. Inflation remained moderate, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.5 percent. The re are emerging signs of wage gains after years of earnings stagnation. This signal, along with overall strong economic conditions, c aused the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate, largely consistent with market expectations. The federal funds rate averaged just 1.8 percent for the year. Economic conditions in Tennessee continued to show marked improvement. State inflation - adjusted GPD was up 2.7 percent for the year while nominal personal income saw a 4.3 percent gain, slightly below the national rate of income growth. While the unemployment rate has drifted up from the remarkably low 3.0 percent rate in September of 2017, it remains low with an average of 3.5 percent for 2018. Nonfarm job s were up 1.8 percent, roughly on par with gains from the previous year. Employment in the state's manufacturing sector slowed to 1.0 percent following 1.4 percent growth in 2017. Short -Term Economic Outlook If the economy remains on track, by mid -year this will be the longest economic expansion in the historical record. The economic outlook for 201 9 and 20 20 calls for slowing growth. A primary consideration is that the economy is operating at full employment, as indicated by record low unemployment rates. There is simply little capacity for economic acceleration. In addition, the influence of federal tax cuts will fade as 2019 unfolds. Other headwinds include tariff wars, rising interest rates, an appreciating dollar, and closure of the federal government. A recession is not expected as economic fundamentals remain strong. U.S. inflation -adjusted GDP is expected to be up 2.7 percent in 201 9 followed by slower growth o f 2.1 percent in the following year. Employment growth will slow to 1.5 percent in 2019 and to just 1.1 percent in 2020, reflecting a scarcity of available workers. The U.S. unemployment rate A-50 should hover in the vicinity of 3.4 percent. Import growth wi ll exceed export growth, hurting the nation's growth prospects. The slowing economy should mean moderation as the Federal Reserve casts its monetary policy .Expect the federal funds rate to average 2.6 percent in 2019. Consumer inflation is expected to c ome in at 2.5 percent followed by slower price gains of 1.9 percent in 2020. Tennessee's inflation -adjusted GDP will be up 2. 6percent in 2019 and 1.9 percent in 2020, generally in line with the national outlook. N ominal personal income will be up 4.3 percent in 201 9and 4.5 percent in 2019. On a fiscal year basis, personal income will advance 4. 3percent in 2019- 2020 . Nonfarm employment is projected to see growth of 1.4 percent in 2019, with slower growth of 0.9 percent projected for 2020. The stateunemployment rate will inch up to 3.6 percent in 2019, as the strong labor market draws more people into the labor market.

A- 110 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 19-2020 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long- run forec asts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid-summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estim ated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the natio n and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long -run consumption trends for the selectively -taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long -run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate franchise and excise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payments. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees are estimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck -related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating pro cess in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires using national and state economic forecasts, developing an offi cial revenue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue collections, and revising estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9 -4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transm itted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The State Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities ,the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and the Treasurer's Office. The State Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates usin g the information provided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The State Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provi de a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor A-59 State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Introduction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 20 19-2020 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources.

The State Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates usin g the information provided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The State Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provi de a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the budget is the responsibility of the Governor A-60 and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letter notifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included atthe end of the s tate revenues section in subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions affecting the State Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recomm ended in the Budget D ocument are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the g eneral fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled asother s tate r evenue. Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years arethree charts included to show collections by fund. The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed last year for 201 7-2018, actual revenue and as it exists currently for 201 8-2019, and 2019-2020 estimates. The funds on the distribution charts, for the Budget Document presentation, are g eneral fund, e ducation ( trust) fund, highway ( transportation) fund, debt s ervice fund, and cities and counties ( local government) fund. (For information about the inclusion of certain special revenue fund taxes and fees in the general fund estimates, see the \"Budget Process\" section ). Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, with the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear . In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are called departmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non -governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties.

June 30, 2020 To Support Statement of State RevenuesState of Tennessee Tax Expenditures Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4- 5106(a)(1) (B)requires the Budget Document to include a schedule of exemptions from state taxes. This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all exemptions from state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year, if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is spec ified. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non- profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramati cally. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1 -A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2019-2020. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1 -B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this ta ble, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double -counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change i n a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).A-67 Actual Estimated Estimated 2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 Commerce and Insurance Regulatory Boards State Board of Accountancy 935,100 $ 1,234,500$ 1,261,000$ State Board of Examiners for Architects and Engineers 1,386,300 1,838,600 1,816,100 Tennessee Auctioneer Commission Collection Service Board 189,100 315,200 239,900 Contractors, Home Improvement, and Interior Designers 3,298,100 3,147,600 State Board of Cosmetology 2,128,200 Funeral Directors and Embalmers of Examiners for Board of Alarm Contractors Investigators Licensing and Regulation 179,200 256,100 Private Protective Services Licensing and Regulation 1,304,100 1,772,900 1,781,900 Board of Polygraph Examiners 75,400 Home 151,000 178,200 Scrap 50,900 65,700 54,800 Services 109,700 91,900 123,400 Health Club Registration 500 0 0 Credit Service Businesses 0 700 1,000 Sub-Total: Commerce and Insurance 15,905,900$ 20,983,600$ 21,103,000$ Health Regulatory Boards Board of Chiropractic Examiners 251,700 $ 239,000 $ 240,300 $ Board of Dentistry 1,301,200 1,288,300 1,295,000 Board of Dietitian / Nutritionist Board of Dispensing Opticians 134,400 Board of Electrolysis Examiners 10,600 11,200 Council for Licensing Hearing Instrument Specialists 67,200 80,600 81,000 Board of Social Worker Certification and Licensure 418,300 420,400 Board of Medical Medical Laboratory Board 651,500 702,800 706,400 Nursing and Certified Medication Aide Licensure 7,327,400 7,475,000 7,513,500 Board of Examiners for Nursing Home Administrators 92,400 109,100 109,600 Board of Occupational and Physical 658,100 Massage Licensure Board Board of Respiratory Podiatry 97,400 102,900 103,200 Board of Cert. for Prof. Counselors, and Marital and Family Therapists 263,200 267,600 269,000 Board of Examiners in Psychology 226,400 291,900 Board for Communication Disorders and Sciences 173,100 Committee on Physician Assistants 266,200 of Veterinary Medical Examiners 676,700 Alcohol and Drug Board of Midwifery 16,100 21,800 21,900 Board of Acupuncture 29,400 37,300 37,500 of Clinical Perfusionists 27,500 25,800 25,900 Management 418,200 157,400 158,100 Behavioral Analyst Board Regulatory Fee 2,898,600$ 2,500,000$ State Board of Law Examiners 20,100 $ Total Regulatory Boards 43,438,100$ 47,600,000$ 47,900,000$ Comparative Statement of Revenues of Regulatory Boards Actual and Estimated July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2020 To Support Statement of State RevenuesState of Tennessee Tax Expenditures Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4- 5106(a)(1) (B)requires the Budget Document to include a schedule of exemptions from state taxes. This section is intended to fulfill that statutory obligation. Under the law, the Budget Document is required to identify all exemptions from state taxes, to the extent that it is practicable, and estimate the amount of revenue that would have been collected by the state in the ensuing fiscal year, if the exemptions were not to exist. No format or reporting period is spec ified. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non- profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramati cally. Such institutions are allowed to buy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1 -A and 1- B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for fiscal year 2019-2020. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1 -B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this ta ble, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double -counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Second, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change i n a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior that impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).A-68 Service/Product Area Exempted State Local * Administrative and Support Services 585,400,000 $ 209,100,000 $ Collection Agencies and Credit Bureaus 28,100,000 10,000,000 Employment Services 319,300,000 114,000,000 Investigation and Security Services 62,300,000 22,300,000 Mail, Document Reproduction, and Call Centers 56,700,000 20,300,000 Services to Buildings and Dwellings 119,000,000 42,500,000 Construction Services 766,700,000 $ 273,900,000 $ Construction of Buildings 224,600,000 80,200,000 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction 87,500,000 31,300,000 Specialty Trade Contractors 454,600,000 162,400,000 Educational 18,500,000 $ 45,300,000 16,200,000 Educational Services (nonprofit) 6,400,000 2,300,000 Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate 270,600,000 $ 96,600,000 $ Investment Banking, Securities Brokerage, and Related 145,700,000 52,000,000 Insurance Agents and Related 15,700,000 5,600,000 Real Estate Agents and Brokers 109,200,000 39,000,000 Health Care and Social Services (For-profit) 1,437,800,000$ 513,500,000 $ Physicians and Dentists Practitioners 92,700,000 33,100,000 Hospitals 225,100,000 80,400,000 Nursing and Residential Care Facilities 175,900,000 62,800,000 Outpatient Care Centers 64,200,000 22,900,000 Medical and Diagnostic Laboratories 60,900,000 21,800,000 Other Selected Health Services 43,200,000 15,400,000 Social and Community Services 58,500,000 20,900,000 Health Care and Social Services (Nonprofit) 810,300,000 $ 289,500,000 $ Hospitals 672,500,000 240,200,000 Nursing and Residential Care Facilities 44,100,000 15,800,000 Outpatient Care Centers 40,900,000 14,600,000 Other Selected Health Services 10,100,000 3,600,000 Social and Community Services 42,700,000 15,300,000 Information Services 88,300,000 $ 34,800,000 $ Data Processing Services 62,700,000 22,400,000 Movie Production and Sound Recording Studios 14,700,000 5,300,000 Cable TV Subscriptions (exempt amount) 10,900,000 7,100,000 Media Advertising Sales 136,900,000 $ 48,900,000 $ Newspaper Advertising 13,600,000 4,900,000 Radio Advertising 17,900,000 6,400,000 Television Advertising (Broadcast and 105,400,000 37,600,000 Personal Services 152,400,000 $ 54,500,000 $ Coin-operated Laundry 2,800,000 1,000,000 Death Care Services 20,600,000 7,400,000 Diet and Weight Loss 1,500,000 500,000 Hair, Nail, and Skin Care Services 66,600,000 23,800,000 Nonprofit Amusement and Membership Organizations 60,900,000 21,800,000 Professional and Technical Services 1,173,600,000$ 419,100,000 $ Accounting, Tax Return Preparation, and Payroll 186,900,000 66,800,000 Advertising and Public Relations 76,900,000 27,500,000 Architectural Services 27,800,000 9,900,000 Engineering Services 151,300,000 54,000,000 All Other Architectural, Engineering, and Related 22,500,000 8,000,000 Specialized Design Services 23,600,000 8,400,000 Computer Systems Design and Related Services 203,200,000 72,600,000 Legal Services (for-profit and nonprofit) 238,300,000 85,100,000 Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting 233,300,000 83,300,000 Scientific Research and Development (for-profit and nonprofit) 9,800,000 3,500,000 Transportation Services (Local Trucking only) 79,700,000 $ 28,500,000 $ Truck Transportation (Local) 79,700,000 28,500,000 Total Revenue Loss 5,553,400,000$ 1,986,900,000$ * Local revenue loss calculated based on an average local sales tax rate of 2.50%.

By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as 10 percent of all state tax revenue collected by the Department of Revenue and allocated to the general fund, the debt service fund and the highway fund are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on all state bonds issued after July 2013. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the debt limit calculation produced a maximum annual debt service debt limit of $794,182,470. The annual debt service requirement on the state's outstanding debt, authorized but unissued debt, and proposed bond authorizations in the fiscal year 20 19-2020 budget total $263,855,000, well below the maximum statutory debt limitation . The statutory debt limitation, therefore, provides for a substantial amount of additional debt capacity . Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management p ractices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding a portion of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing de bt, creating and maintaining a Rainy Day Fund to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and the adoption of state statutes designed to control the issuance of excessive debt. The state continues to maintain a relative low debt burden, and acc ess to the capital markets remains strong . Tenness ee's commitment to conservative and pr udent debt management is widely recognized by the nation's leading debt -rating agencies. Current ratings on the state's general obligation long -term debt are AAA: Fitch AAA , Standard and Poor's AAA, and Moody's Investor Service Aaa. Tennessee did not issue additional general obligation debt in the first six months of fiscal year 2018-2019. As of June 30, 2018, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $1,741,155, excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF). This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. In the spring of fiscal 2018, the second session of the 110 th General Assembly approved new general obligation bond autho rizations in the amount of $215,295,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $57,587,000, economic and community development grants $30,708,000, an d highway bonds $127,000,000. The state's practice of using surplus cash to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long -standing policy, the State Funding Board cancelled $82,000,000 in highway construction bonds and $13,281,487 in regular general obligation bond authorizations in fiscal year 2017-2018. The reduction in bond authorization s coupled with the Funding Board 's action on bond cancellations decreased the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,232,770,000, which includes $ 404.8 million in capital construction bonds, $745.8 million in highway fund authorizations, and $82.1 million in FRF bonds.

A- 154 State of Tennessee Capital Budget Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 201 9-2020 A capital project begins when an agency or department identifies a need that can be met through the Capital Budget Process. At a designated point in the year, a gencies and departments submit these project concepts to the Departments of General Services and Finance and Administration . Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, a phased approach of review is undertaken by the Departments of General Services and F inance and Administration . The initial phase focuses on a needs assessme nt to establish priority and direction. During this phase, feasibility and/or market studies are performed to determine the viability of the project, project risks, and potential routes of implementation. The goal of the initial phase is to generate a rec ommend ation regarding the disposition of the project. The next phase provides additional planning to develop better cost estimates. The end result of the above phased approach is the development and prioritization of a formal capital budget request. The various agencies and departments annually submit both their capital maintenance and capital improvement requests in priority order to the Department of Finance and Administration , Division of Budget . All capital budget requests are further reviewed on both a technical and financial basis upon receipt by the Department of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are re viewed within projected avail ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insufficient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The a dministration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impe tus for all capital outlay, support program , and service requirements . Funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs t o find the best mix of capital improvements and maintenance to sustain and implem ent programs. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and future capital expenditures through better design and more fle xible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prisons. When a capital project creates the need for additional operational funding, the operating costs are identified during the capital budget review and further re viewed in the develo pment of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission, comprised of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Treasurer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commission, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, overse es leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly reflect projects meeting State Building Commis sion requirements and policy guid elines. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non- routine repairs and replacements unrelated to n ew construction and costing $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are addressed within the departments' operation al budget major maintenance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifica tions for health and safety issues, repairs to improve utility sy stems, repaving, roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state entities .

Funding for these projects is allocated to the individual state entities . A-130 Capital improvement projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extending the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or se rvice systems, land with or without buildings, appurtenances, site improvements or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or improved facility that require s the assistance of a design professional or costs $100,000 or more. The 20 19-2020 capital outlay budget recommends $417,020,100 divided between capital improvement projects and capital maintenance requests. The recommendation includes $223.5 million for higher education pro jects, $115 million for economic development projects, $28 million for state parks, $24. 6 million for correction facilities , and various up grades to state facilities . Capital Improvement Projects \u2014 Capital improvement projects recommended for fi scal year 2019-2020 total $289,570,100, including $272,536,300 from state appropriation . Other funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. Projects from dedicated sources of revenue are also recommended for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency totaling $5,570,000. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recom mended at a level o f $127,450,000. A st ate appropriation of $40,560,500 is requested. Federal and o ther funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on maintaining current f acilities, primarily through repair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal standards for asbestos and citizens with disabilities. The Locally Governed Higher Education Institutions, the Tennessee Board of Regents, and the University of Tennessee are also funded for modifications to assist in ADA compliance. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 Total capital maintenance, capital improvement s, and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require no new bond authorization . T he following chart compares the bond authorizations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital fund ing in the amount of $47,963,000 is recommended for c apital mainte nance and capital i mprovement projects. A general fund appropriation of $24,990,000 and re- sidual appropriation of $4,700,000 is recommended. Other funding sources account for the remainder of the total amount . These projects are listed in the \"Facilities Revolving Fund \" section, which follows the \" Capital Budget \" section of this document. Operating Costs \u2014 This section includes estimates of the first year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction. Differences can be the result of efficiencies from better designs and energy systems or program requirements. Renovation projects that do not have an i mpact on operating efficiencies are considered to be cost neu tral. Only those projects that will have in creased operating costs from the current budget are included in the schedule. 84.1 437.6 0 Recommended vs. Approved RECOMMENDED APPROVEDProposed Capital Appropriations from Bonds, Current Funds, and Other Revenues Fiscal Year 2019-2020 COUNTY TOTAL STATE BONDS FEDERAL OTHER Correction Maintenance Statewide 24,600,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 24,600,000$ Economic and Community DevelopmentAmazon Operations Center Infrastructure Grant Davidson 65,000,000 $ 65,000,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Volkswagen Plant Infrastructure Grant Hamilton 50,000,000 50,000,000 0 0 0 Sub-Total Economic and Community Development 115,000,000 $ 115,000,000$ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ EducationMaintenance Statewide 2,070,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,070,000 $ Environment and ConservationMaintenance Statewide 8,520,000 $ 2,925,500 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,594,500 $ Fall Creek Falls State Park Inn Replacement Van Buren 11,000,000 11,000,000 0 0 0 Paris Landing State Park Inn Replacement Henry 8,470,000 8,470,000 0 0 0 Sub-Total Environment and Conservation 27,990,000 $ 22,395,500 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,594,500 $ General ServicesMaintenance Statewide 4,200,000 $ 4,200,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Emergency and Contingency Funds Statewide 5,000,000 5,000,000 0 0 0 Sub-Total General Services 9,200,000 $ 9,200,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Human ServicesMaintenance Statewide 5,330,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,330,000 $ Intellectual and Developmental DisabilitiesMaintenance Statewide 590,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 590,000 $ Military Maintenance Statewide 8,705,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 3,262,500 $ 5,442,500 $ Locally Governed Higher Education Institutions Austin Peay State University Maintenance Statewide 3,770,000 $ 3,770,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ East Tennessee State University Maintenance Statewide 4,110,000 $ 4,110,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Middle Tennessee State UniversityMaintenance Statewide 6,370,000 $ 6,370,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ School of Concrete and Construction Management Rutherford 40,100,000 34,085,000 0 0 6,015,000 Sub-Total Middle Tennessee State University 46,470,000 $ 40,455,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 6,015,000 $ Tennessee State UniversityMaintenance Statewide 2,475,000 $ 2,475,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Tennessee Technological UniversityMaintenance Statewide 7,910,000 $ 7,910,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ Engineering Building Planning Putnam 3,250,000 3,250,000 0 0 0 Sub-Total Tennessee Technological University 11,160,000 $ 11,160,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ University of MemphisMaintenance Statewide 8,970,000 $ 6,650,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,320,000 $ Sub-Total Locally Governed Higher Education Institutions 76,955,000 $ 68,620,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 8,335,000 $ Tennessee Board of RegentsMaintenance Statewide 19,710,000 $ 720,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 18,990,000$ TCAT Athens and Cleveland Higher Education Center McMinn 17,750,100 0 0 3,518,800 Sub-Total Tennessee Board of 37,460,100 $ 14,951,300 $ 0 $ 0 $ 22,508,800$ University of TennesseeMaintenance Statewide 20,120,000 $ 1,430,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 18,690,000$ UTIA & Environmental Science of $ 82,930,000 $ 0 $ 0 $ 26,190,000$ A-131 Capital improvement projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extending the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility.

Judicial power is vested in trial courts and two levels of appeals courts that comprise the state's court system. The Supreme Court is comprised of five justices elected to eight-year terms. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The intermediate appellate courts are the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts, as well as post-conviction petitions. The state 's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit, and Probate courts. Chancery courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law or statutory law proves inadequate for cases. Circuit courts, which sometimes overlap with the jurisdiction of Chancery courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate courts have primary jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile, and Municipal courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions courts vary by county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties in which the Legislature has established separate Juvenile courts.

These plans inc lude designing and updating the forms and instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting their operational and capital budget reque sts to the Division of Budget. These electronic forms and instructions are distributed to the agencies in August . The deadline for completion and transmission of the budget requests is the first of October. During this preparation period, the staff of the Division of Budget meets as needed with agencies' fiscal , capital , and program personnel to answer questions a nd provide assistance in developing their budget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise , and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9 -4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the budget review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and their staffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 granted the Governor the authority and duty to develop and submit to the General Assembly a recommended budget.

The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. B-320 The Budget Process After the receipt of agency operational and capital budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Within this constraint, funds must be provided for administration initiatives of high priority, activities mandated by state or federal statute, and the day -to-day operat ion of state government. Instructions for the agency operational budget requests include the submission of two levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates the continuation of current services, and (b) a cost increase r e- quest, which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for rev- enue reductions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services. Capital budget requests are submitted to the Division of Budget along with agency operating budget requests, where they are reviewed in conjunction with the Real Estate Asset Management office. Based on these reviews and available funding, recommen- dations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and t he Gove r- nor for consideration in the budget document. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom - mendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with commissioners and director s of the departments and agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Admin-istration. A consensus is sought with the agencies as to the appropriate funding level for the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, the Division of Budget staff makes any revis ions that have been agreed upon and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the administration's initiatives and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with agency heads and may direct them to submit plans for furthe r adjustments to their budgets. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget Document must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. The various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the Appropriations B ill that fall within their purviews. The departments often are invited to testify before these committees on issues relating to their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committee s of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any amendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill is then sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same A ppropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of the General Appropriations Bill usually The Budget Process occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line -item veto or reduce specific appropriations. Or, he could veto the entire bill; but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over -ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act each year. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: preparation of work programs , and development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. These changes are made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is provided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintained through the Fiscal Review Committee and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees must be informed of any new or expanded programs resulting from unanticipated departmental revenues. These revenues usually are new federal grants, but also may be other departmental revenues. When noti ce of unexpected revenue is received by an agency, the Commissione r of Finance and Administration may submit an expansion report to the chairmen of the finance committees for acknowledgement , if he wants t o approve the program expansion. Upon the chairmen's acknowledgement of the expansion report, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional departmental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on their own authority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropriations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated may not occur without the approval of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate , and the Comptroller of the Tr easury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Division of Budget staff reviews the status of the various allotments and advises the Commissioner of Finance and Admin - istration of any problems. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the respon sibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process.

At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the respon sibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. B-322 The Budget Process Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. Post-audit is a responsibility of the Comptroller of the Treasury, an official elected by the General Assembly. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller's Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits of all state departments and agencies. Intermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds also are within the purview of this division, and state grants to other entities also are subject to aud it. In addition, program audits are performed to determine whether agencies are functioning efficiently. The General Assembly also participates in a continuing review throughout the fiscal year. The Fiscal Review Committee, a bipartisan committee comprised of members from both houses, meets regularly when the General Assembly is not in session. Following a set agenda, members of this committee review audit reports and departmental personnel respond to inquiries about activities and programs under the department's jurisdiction. Governmental Accountability: Strategic Planning and Performance Measures The Governmental Accountability Act of 2013 amended the Governmental Accountability Act of 2002, which requires strategic planning, performance measures, and performance audits. By August 15 each year, executive branch agencies submit strategic plans to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration who may require modifications. The commissioner must consolidate approved plans and submit them to the Governor and General Assembly by September 30 each year . For 2014, the Commissioner of Finance and Adminis tration, as allowed by law, exempted the Higher Education Commission and non -cabinet agencies from submitting plans to Finance and Administration, but encouraged the commission and non- cabinet agencies to continue the planning process. The judicial branch, Comptroller of the Treasury, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attorney General and Reporter, and legislative branch are not subject to strategic plan review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. They must submit pl ans separately to the General Assembly and Governor by September 30. Under the Accountability Act, instructions for developing strategic plans and performance measures are issued to executive branch agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Administrat ion, who under other law , also issues budget instructions to all agencies. The Governmental Accountability Act requires the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to annually evaluate strategic plans and performance measures. Also under the Governme ntal Accountability Act, as well as under other law, each state agency is subject to performance review by the Comptroller of the Treasury. The Governmental Accountability Acts of 2013 and 2002 continue the Tennessee tradition of strong executive managemen t of the line agencies, begun with the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1923, and strong executive budget development and budget execution responsibility, begun with the budget law of 1937. The General Assembly has the prerogative to alter executive recommendations through the Appropriations Act and to alter policy and exert oversight through the legislative and performance review processes. State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual Budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modif ied accrual basis of accounting - the method under which revenues are recognized when they become available and measurable, and expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred. Most appropriations generally lapse at the end of each fiscal year. Appropriations for contractual obligations in the highway fund do not lapse at year end but are carried forward for subsequent year expenditure s. In addition, it is the s tate's budgetary practice to appropriate matching dollars for jointly funded projects in the year of federal apportionment. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a mod ified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Go vernor to present his proposed B udget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the Budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the program level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the Budget , in the form of the Appropriat ions Act, becomes the state's financial plan for the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a D ivision of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the Budget by the Division of Budget on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature , require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in detail in the \"Budget Process\" subsection. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governor and Commissioner of Financ e and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (t ransportation, or highway fund), Capital Outlay ( capital projects fund ), facilities revolving fund , debt service (or sinking ) fund, and Cities and Counties - State -Shared Taxes ( Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, including the Lottery for Education Account, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the general fund in the presentation of the \" Budget Overview ,\" although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the ope rating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document , except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget , revenue estimates for special revenue, internal service, and enterprise fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the general fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlif e Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Public Utility Commission Education Fund B-323 The Budget Process Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the general fund, although the tax apportionments for the education fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the Budget . It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the education fund are less than the education appropriations, requiring general fund tax support for education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents), the Foreign Language Institute, and the dedicated- source appropriation in the Lottery for Education Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document , certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and sales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the Budget easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does present the special revenue and other funds separate ly from the general fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In t he government -wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business -type activities. The government -wide financial statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transact ions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department s of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sa les and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Net education lottery proceeds and 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes fund higher education scholarships and a fter-school programs; Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agen cies; and, Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities. The state's non- major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific revenues earmarked to financ e particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long -term debt; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not prin cipal, can be spent. All of the gover nmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized when they become measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Principal revenue sources considered susceptible to accrual include taxes, federal funds, local funds , and investment income. Taxes and similarly measurable fees and fi nes, are generally considered to be available if collected within 60 days after fiscal year -end. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met, and the amount is received during the current period or within six months after fiscal year -end. The state uses this same six month availability period for most other measurable revenues. However , tobacco and similar litigation settlement proceeds are generally considered available if co llection is expected within 12 months after fiscal year-end. Licenses, permits, and other similar miscellaneous revenue items are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the state.

Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the general fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development Agency Grain Indemnity Fund Client Protection Fund. In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the general fund, although the tax apportionments for the education fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the Budget . It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the education fund are less than the education appropriations, requiring general fund tax support for education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K -12), including general -source programs and the dedicated -source After -School Programs Special Account, funded by 100% of unclaimed lottery prizes; (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents), the Foreign Language Institute, and the dedicated- source appropriation in the Lottery for Education Account; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document , certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and sales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the Budget easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does present the special revenue and other funds separate ly from the general fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public. Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government -wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government.

B-326 Basis of Budgeting and Accounting The state's proprietary fund financial statements include: Enterprise Funds - used to account for the operations of self -sustaining state agencies providing goods or services to the general public on a user- charge basis. Two of these funds are considered major funds - sewer treatment loan fund and employment security fund. Non- major funds are reported in a single column; and, Internal Service Funds - used to account for goods or services provided to other departments or agencies of the state or other governments, on a cost reimbursement basis. These funds are reported in a single column. The proprietary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The state's fiduciary funds financial statements include: Pension Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- administered retirement system; Employee Benefit Trust Fund - used to account for the funds contributed by employees under the IRC Section 125 cafeteria plan; Investment Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state-sponsored external investment pool; Private -Purpose Trust Funds - used to report trust arrangements under which the principal and income benefit individuals , private organizations, or other governments; and, Agency Funds - used to account for amounts held in custody of others. Fiduciary fund types are used to account for resources held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and cannot be used to support the government's own programs. The fiduciary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting, except for agency funds, which do not recognize revenues and expenditures and do not present the results of operations. Discretely presented compon ent units include: Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) Community Services Agency Tennessee Certified Cotton Growers' Organization Tennessee Housing Development Agency Tennessee Local Development Authority Tennessee State Veterans' Homes Board Tennessee State School Bond Authority Tennessee Board of Regents University of Tennessee Board of Trustees Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation Access Tennessee.
