If you're interested, let us know via DM on Instagram, email, or our website. Transcript Innate VIPs what's up is Dr. Chris. Just want to give you your innate VIP tip for the week. It's about chemical toxicity and I'm going to give you first access first knowledge to an upcoming event we've got going on. So first and foremost chemical toxicity is a very important one to us because we're living in a very toxic world. It didn't always use to be this way. But basically for the last let's say at least 20 years, the level of toxins in our system has just gradually increased and we have to work harder to make sure to avoid those things and now even work to get them out of our system. Once they've already made their way in through different processes, including a supplement protocol that I will share with you down the road soon. So it is one of the main things that we talked about in one of our Wellness workshops for new patients if you've been to this Workshop, You know that I talked extensively about my health history in which I was taking a lot of pharmaceuticals from kind of the lower level ones and the antibiotic realm to more hardcore one called Accutane that really wrecked my gut so that chemical subluxation is very near and dear to us because it's the reason we got into or I got into Health in the first place. Dr. Adana had her own chemical subluxation with the overuse of ibuprofen and Tylenol. So it's something we talked about a lot and we talked about a lot of food. We talked a lot about supplementation things that are important parts of our everyday life that we share with you guys. So there's a couple of things that really stand out and they've been themes over the last couple of weeks. So you guys will be hearing hit it here first if you're watching this in the morning, but we are having our first chemical toxicity Workshop. Probably in over like two years, that's going to be on Tuesday, March 30th at 6:00 p.m. You can reply to this email to RSVP. You can also click the link below and it will take you over to the page where you can do a digital RSVP straight to the page actually suggest you do that because we're going to be in that mode you're going to get some extra content and extra videos talking about what the workshop will entail we invite you to invite a friend. Call the babysitter to leave the kids at home. This is going to be a lot of higher-level education. I know there are some workshops in the past where we have said bring the kids along and they'll get some good content out of it as well. This one's more adult-driven. You're going to have more, you know, undivided attention. If you can leave the kids behind for this one and it'll be an investment in your time because they will benefit from you learning the stuff and you can implement it right away because this topic of chemical toxicity can get very overwhelming because there's the food level of it, right? There's the vaccine level of it. That's going to be a heavy topic in this conversation because if you're like me, I got my childhood vaccines that were recommended by the CDC up until that point, but I'm a child of the 80s, you know those a big drastic change in the early 90s as far as how many were given which doses some that didn't exist when I was you know, those ages and to even receive and obviously the school implication here in California. So we're going to talk about all that. There's that level there are the daily medications whether it's for simple stuff like an ear infection. Like are we giving meds? Are we not what can we give instead? What are the long-term effects of giving antibiotics for an ear infection? So we're going to get into those things and then there's a whole side that we're not really necessarily even paying attention to and it's personal care products and maybe some of you guys are but Soaps, lotions, contact solution, hair products, nail products. There's so much and there are easier resources to help you navigate those things and we're going to provide that to you guys during that Workshop. So if you'd like to come put it on your calendar now, March 30th at 6:00 p.m. We will provide a chair lots of Education probably some good healthy snacks that are not going to increase your toxic load. Yeah. If you got any questions, please let us know. Like I said click the link and it will take you over to the page where you can RSVP if you don't want to do that, well, you're not going to get the extra videos, but you can still come to class and just hit reply on this email and we'll put you on the list. Additionally. There will be a list in the office where you can just go old-fashioned and just write your name down and we will email you a reminder as we get closer to the workshop. So I hope you guys can attend and like I said, you can share this with someone else, you don't have to be someone actively under care here. You can bring a friend. You can bring a co-worker to bring a family member. Whoever it is. We need to get this information out. So if you have any questions like I said, let us know if not, enjoy the rest of your day and we'll see you at the workshop. Bye! If you have any questions or would like to RSVP to this workshop, please don't hesitate to reach out to us and let us know in person or through email, text, and DM.
