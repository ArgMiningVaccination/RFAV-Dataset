Since 2000, the WHO estimates that the vaccine has saved the lives of more than 20 million people. But hundreds of thousands still die every year worldwide. The vaccination rate in Sweden is 97% but one place stands out. In 2012, the Swedish Public Health Agency discovered that at a health center in J\u00e4rna, only five percent of children in a cohort were vaccinated against measles. Iron is known as a center of anthroposophy, a spiritual movement. At the same time, there is also an anthroposophical clinic, Vidarkliniken, which receives financial support from several county councils. When measles breaks out in the countryside, advice from the clinic is also spread that parents should try to rub their children's rashes all over their bodies. A doctor also believes, contrary to proven science, that measles is spiritually developing for the children who go through it. The question of what is going on in J\u00e4rna will eventually reach the government. And the world of anthroposophists will come to an end.
