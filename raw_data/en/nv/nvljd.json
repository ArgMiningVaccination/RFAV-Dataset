His Ph.D. study focused on the biochemical pathways involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic chronic complications. He then practiced as a Clinical Associate Professor in adult endocrinology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University for many years. In 1995, his interest in basic research led him to the USA. He first studied the central modulation of pain, particularly focused on the molecular neuroanatomical pathways in both central and peripheral nerve system in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroanatomy of University of Minnesota. In 1999, he moved to the University of Virginia to study the central regulation of respiratory and cardiovascular function in the Department of Pharmacology. Currently, he is a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Medicine. Since 2002, his research interest has been focusing on the insulin action on vascular endothelial biology and the molecular machinery that mediates biomacromoleculars move across the endothelial barrier. Dr. Wang has authored over 40 peer-reviewed publications. Hong Wang research interests are on Insulin action on vascular endothelial biology and the molecular machinery that mediates biomacromoleculars move across the endothelial barrier.
