The other was left permanently paralyzed after he contracted polio at the age of thirteen while walking through a burning Berlin at the end of World War II. He spent months in an iron lung and almost died. Growing up, I was inoculated against polio and other infectious diseases and remember feeling gratitude and reverence for vaccination, this miracle of modern medicine. Little did I know that decades later I would become an outspoken critic of current vaccination practices after several years of completely unexpected and shocking clinical experience with vaccine injuries. TINUS SMITS AND AUTISM It all started in the spring of 2011, when I bought a book titled Autism, Beyond Despair, by the Dutch medical doctor and homeopath Tinus Smits.1 I had been interested in autism since graduating from naturopathic college in 1991 and kept abreast of new publications. Over the years, I had treated many children with autism and other developmental disorders\u2014 sometimes with success, but sometimes with absolutely no results at all. A couple of the failures still play on my mind to this day, including a little autistic boy who was severely hyperactive and smeared the walls and furniture with his feces when he was not climbing them. Nothing I tried helped him. Tinus Smits described his experience of treating more than three hundred children with autism over thirty years using, among other things, homeopathic remedies made from vaccines. In his opinion, about 70 percent of children on the autism spectrum had been primarily affected by vaccines, and the rest predominantly by medications and chemicals. Most had been affected by multiple factors. I could not put the book down, and when it was done, I had to deal with a huge and painful paradigm shift: Vaccines looked as if they could seriously harm children even though we were giving them to protect children. HOMEOPATHY AND TAUTOPATHY Homeopathy is based on the idea that a substance that can cause symptoms in a healthy organism can heal similar symptoms in a sick one. Of course, the remedies are used in homeopathic form and are for the most part so highly diluted as to be immaterial. There is a sub-branch of homeopathy called tautopathy, which uses\u2014again, in homeopathic form\u2014substances known or suspected to cause problems to address the same. For example, arsenic poisoning can be alleviated by using a homeopathic remedy made from arsenic. These remedies have been researched on animals2-7 and humans; trials are currently underway in India to use homeopathic arsenic to help people poisoned by arsenic-contaminated drinking water.8-11 We also have some interesting research looking at homeopathic preparations of cadmium,12,13 mercury14-18 and lead19 to help with toxicity from these heavy metals. Getting back to vaccines\u2014according to Tinus Smits, if a vaccine was suspected to have hurt a child or adult, a homeopathic remedy prepared from this vaccine could potentially help, rendering these homeopathic remedies not only therapeutic, but also diagnostic. I soon took training to learn to use the Smits system properly. I met other practitioners doing the same work. We documented cases and exchanged information. It quickly became clear that vaccine injuries were pervasive in children and were disguised as many different illnesses and syndromes\u2014allergies, asthma, hyperactivity, insomnia, diabetes, bowel and eating disorders, epilepsy, speech delays, sensory processing disorders, social anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, autism and even death. Something else that became apparent to us was that most vaccine injuries were delayed reactions, delayed on average by two to four months, an observation that has been confirmed from immunology.20 Since no vaccines on the childhood schedule have ever been tested for longer than a maximum of six weeks (the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella)\u2014and most of them for only a few days\u2014there is no \"scientific\" documentation of these delayed reactions. My personal estimate is that at least 90 percent of vaccine injuries are delayed reactions and therefore not recognized as such. In some cases, both immediate and delayed reactions appear. Thus the proportion of vaccine injuries due to immediate, severe reactions is relatively small, yet even so the Internet is full of tens of thousands of documented reports by individuals and parents from around the world describing their or their children's descent into chronic illness after vaccines. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the U.S. has paid out in excess of four billion dollars since its inception in 1986\u2014and Harvard University has estimated that only about 1 percent of vaccine injuries ever get reported, never mind settled through the compensation program.21 FACIAL TIC, FOLLOWED BY SLEEP AND BOWEL CHANGES In October of 2016, I saw a five-month-old baby girl who had developed a facial tic immediately after her two-month vaccinations, which included the six-in-one Infanrix hexa vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B) and the meningococcal-C, pneumococcal-C and rotavirus vaccines. The child's tic would occur several times per day and sometimes involved her right shoulder and leg as well. This condition lasted for three weeks and was very alarming to the parents, although their doctor told them that \"this was a normal developmental phase.\" The baby also became lethargic and extremely quiet. But there were other concerns. \"More recently, her sleep has changed,\" her mother reported. \"She used to be a good sleeper, but lately is waking every two hours some nights. Only one month ago, she slept for nine to ten hours at a time.\" The mother also described bowel changes. \"Now she also has diarrhea, which comes and goes. Her bowels were like clockwork before\u2014one bowel movement in the morning and one at night. Now there can be two days between movements, or else she goes four times a day.\" This was rather troubling. Although the tics had cleared up, her vocalization had not recovered, and she was beginning to develop sleep and digestive abnormalities, two months after her first and only set of vaccinations. But which of the vaccines did it? This is part of the problem. The child received three separate shots\u2014one of which contained six different antigens plus the various chemicals\u2014plus a fourth vaccine administered orally (in other words, the usual cocktail given to our modern-day infants). I used applied kinesiology testing to narrow things down, and the baby received a homeopathic remedy made from the meningococcal vaccine. A few days later, her mother wrote: \"She is sleeping very well, has regular bowel movements once per day, is happy, making lots of sounds and has lots of energy. Her sleep is the biggest change: We spent the last four weeks only sleeping two to four hours at a time; last night, she slept for nine hours straight!\" Over the next six weeks, the child had a couple more doses of the homeopathic meningococcal-C remedy. Her sleep and bowels remained normal, and she became very talkative, bright and playful. She lives in my neighborhood and now, at four years old, is a totally normal child. This case illustrates that adverse reactions after a vaccination can include immediate symptoms as well as delayed symptoms. The latter are often missed in routine pediatric care, especially as vaccine administration continues every two months in the first six months, as well as at twelve and eighteen months. FAILURE TO THRIVE AND INSOMNIA Earlier in 2016, I saw another baby in a similar situation. She had received two rounds of vaccines instead of one, and she had just been diagnosed with failure to thrive. \"She has not gained any weight in the last month at all,\" her mother told me. \"She has not grown in length nor has her head circumference changed. This started after her second round of vaccines a month ago.\" The mother also described the baby's sleep problems. \"She has a terrible time sleeping, which also changed after her vaccines.\" She had received her first round of vaccines when she was two months old. Immediately afterwards, her sleep deteriorated. \"Before the vaccinations, she slept for four to five hours at a time. Then it changed to only one to two hours at a time for the next few weeks. It has gotten even worse since her second round of vaccines a month ago. Now she sometimes only sleeps for thirty minutes. I am absolutely exhausted.\" There were further problems. \"Her bowels are not working properly anymore either. The last two weeks she stopped having any bowel movements altogether. We have to give her glycerin suppositories, or she will not have any movements at all. She is also often fussy, arches her back and cries a lot.\" When I saw her, the baby looked unwell and undernourished, with sunken eyes and a lack of facial expression. Again, this was an obvious vaccine injury situation, only far more dire. This baby could barely sleep at all, could not have any natural bowel movements whatsoever and had stopped growing and developing. Again, I used applied kinesiology testing to narrow things down. Oddly enough, this baby also tested best for the meningococcal vaccine. She received the homeopathic remedy made from the vaccine in the 30C potency. A week later, her mother wrote: \"We noticed a change right away after the first dose of the remedy. The same evening, she could suddenly sit up in her high chair. Before, she drooped sideways on it. Now she can sit quite well. And her sleep has improved. The same night that she had the remedy, she slept for four to five hours straight. Overall, she now sleeps for two to three hours at a time, much better than the thirty to sixty minutes before. Her naps are better, too; she will sleep for a solid hour now. Yesterday, she had two bowel movements on her own for the first time, without the suppositories. She now has laughing fits. She did not laugh like that before. Several people have commented on how relaxed she is.\" The mother also shared this: \"I took her back to my doctor who gave the vaccines, and the doctor told me that she was a 'bad baby.' She told me to put her into a room for twelve hours and let her scream to teach her a lesson. She said the longer I could stay away from that room, the better. And this doctor just had a baby herself!\" Finally, the mother stated, \"These past few weeks were the worst time of my life. I was crying a lot with all this stress and the sleep deprivation.\" I continued the baby on the same remedy in increasing potencies for the next two weeks. By that time, she had gained a whole pound of weight, one centimeter in head circumference and one centimeter in length. Later, the baby relapsed on this remedy and needed other remedies made from the other vaccines she had received, as well as a couple of constitutional remedies to stabilize and recover completely This took about one and a half years in all, but thankfully she is now completely well. In my opinion, this child was close to death. Had she received another vaccine\u2014or, for that matter, no homeopathy\u2014who knows what might have happened to her? This case illustrates the additive impact of vaccines in a susceptible child. SUSPECTED AUTISM Two common complaints in the autism community are disturbed sleep and gastrointestinal problems. These two 2016 cases taught me that early changes in sleep and digestion are warning signs to be very careful with future vaccines. Time and again, I have heard parents of children on the autism spectrum describe subtle changes in their children after early vaccinations, but they were reassured and more vaccines were given\u2014with dire consequences. One of these cases, which again showed a clear delayed reaction, was that of a little boy I saw in 2014. The distressed father had said on the phone: \"My son has stopped babbling, has lost all eye contact and is banging his head all the time. I am afraid it's autism. Can you see us today?\" This adorable fifteen-month-old boy had received his twelve-month shots three months earlier. They had included the MMR, varicella, meningococcal and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Within four weeks, two small red spots became visible at the MMR and varicella injection sites on his upper left arm. Three weeks later, a spreading, eczematous lesion (2.4 centimeters in diameter) had developed at the varicella injection site, and eleven days later his entire body was covered in patches of itchy, eczematous eruptions. A dermatologist who saw the child diagnosed him with a vaccine reaction. \"Yesterday he toe-walked and reverted back to crawling, even though he's already been walking for two months,\" the mother said, \"and he is hitting everybody and everything.\" He now wanted to be carried constantly and was very irritable. He was grinding his teeth, refused to eat anything but milk and meat and had also developed greenish-black diarrhea over the past two weeks. His previously good sleep was now interrupted and filled with crying spells. He had begun to perspire heavily on his head and feet and ran out of breath when running. During the office visit, the boy made no contact with me, needed to be held almost the whole time, threw my toys around and repeatedly banged his head hard against his parents' chests. Although he had not been formally assessed, this looked to all of us a lot like autism symptoms. In this case, we were able to trace it back to the chickenpox vaccine, as this is where the eruption around the injection site started. Again, there was a time delay of about three months before \"autism\" symptoms occurred. This toddler did very well on a homeopathic remedy made from the chickenpox vaccine. He also received a constitutional remedy to address his underlying susceptibility to vaccine reactions. As with the other cases, there were improvements within days. His diarrhea stopped, he started eating normally again, stopped banging his head and could sleep again. However, this case took a good two years to resolve completely. Over time, we had to detox every vaccine he had received and use other remedies as well, until he stopped relapsing and stabilized. Today, he is a completely well, totally normal seven-year old. \"We snatched him away from the devil just in time,\" his father said when he had recovered. RECOGNIZING VACCINE INJURIES Although these three cases are success stories, it is by no means always easy to heal children with vaccine injuries. I use these cases to illustrate some points. Most importantly, the younger the child and the sooner after the injury, the better the chances of recovery. Although an older child who was injured years ago can still improve, it can be a challenging process for all. Over the past twenty-five to thirty years, there has been a sharp increase in chronic disease in children, especially immunological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Up to 50 percent of American children now suffer with a chronic illness, ranging from allergies to diabetes, and many of these conditions are listed as known adverse events on vaccine package inserts.22 Official autism rates are one in fifty-four children (and one in thirty-six boys), and many believe that official data underestimate the extent of the problem. Other conditions\u2014such as ADHD, hyperactivity, speech disorders, sensory processing disorders and anxiety\u2014are also rampant in children, and we are seeing record rates of autoimmune disease in both youth and adults. All of these upticks correlate with the doubling and then tripling of the vaccine schedule after 1986, when Congress granted complete legal immunity to vaccine makers for vaccines. Because of vaccines' classification as \"biologics\" rather than drugs, the industry gets away with not testing vaccines against inert placebos or carrying out long-term clinical trials. Meanwhile, profits from vaccines have nearly doubled, from thirty billion dollars in 2014 to fifty-four billion dollars in 2019, and they are expected to exceed sixty billion dollars in 2020, without even counting additional profits from any Covid-19 vaccines. On top of that, companies are reaping another five hundred million dollars in profits for all the drugs prescribed to treat these potentially vaccine-linked conditions. Meanwhile, officials are presenting and persecuting homeopathy as unscientific, useless or even dangerous. Dangerous indeed, but only to Big Pharma's profits. This simple and inexpensive method of healing is not only therapeutic but also diagnostic, helping to unmask the damage modern chemical medicine is inflicting on humanity. Homeopathy offers a ray of hope for healing the world\u2014a medicine for all, including animals and plants, and for almost no cost\u2014a blessing indeed.
