explore the feasibility and acceptability of transitioning office -based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) of adult patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) from physicians to pharmacists. Information generated from this pilot study will be used to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will test the effect of a physicianpharmacis t collaborative care model in the management of patients with OUD. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the collaborative care model by measuring recruitment rate, treatment retention rate, treatment compliance rate, and partic ipants' substance use. Treatment fidelity; participant, physician, and pharmacist satisfaction with OUD care; participant safety; and the pharmacists' use of electronic health records (EHR) and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) will also be e xplored. The clinical significance of this pilot study is to explore a coordinated care model based on an operational agreement protocol among members of the same health care team that can shift the work burden from OBBT physicians to pharmacists during buprenorphine maintenance. Through this distribution of work, physicians are better enabled to treat a higher number of patients with OUD while helping pharmacists develop OUD and substance use disorder (SUD) care skills management, thus more effectively a ssisting in the reduction of medication diversion and doctor shopping among this patient population. This Operational Care Agreement (OCA; see SOP for OCA in the Manual of Operating Procedures (MOP)) defines the tasks and responsibilities of OBBT physicians and community pharmacists in the management of OUD. Under the OCA, a licensed OBBT physician diagnoses patients, supervises patient care, and refers pati ents to a pharmacist under a protocol that allows the pharmacist to perform specific patient care functions (Giberson et al., 2011). Under this agreement, pharmacists working within the context of a defined protocol are permitted to assume professional res ponsibility for performing patient assessments, administering medications, and monitoring medication regimens. The overall results of this study will open new research venues to accelerate collaborative opportunities among primary care providers, addiction providers and researchers, and pharmacists (e.g., NIDA, American Pharmacists Association). 2.2 Study Design This pilot study will use a non -randomized prospective design to collect feasibility data and operational information regarding the developmen t of a physician -pharmacist collaborative care model defined by an operational care agreement for the management of patients with OUD. Pharmacists are health professionals. To explore the feasibility, this pilot study focuses broadly on licensed pharmacist s in a variety of pharmacy settings, regardless of their prescriber status. The conceptual model of physician -pharmacist collaboration in the management of patients with opioid use disorder (Figure 1): This pilot study builds on existing evidence demonstr ating the key role of the pharmacist within the health care team to help improve delivery and accessibility of medical treatment, as well as initial indications of a positive collaboration between physician and pharmacist in the management of OUD (APhA, 20 14; DiPaula & Menachery, 2015). Specifically, pharmacists are ideally positioned to engage in efforts aimed at improving OUD care management and drug overdose prevention (APhA, 2014). Pharmacists not only dispense prescription medications (\"gatekeepers\"), but also may be involved in educating patients about safe medication practices (including medication storage and disposal), identifying red flags that warrant further investigation (e.g., diversion, improper prescribing, drug -drug CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 4 interaction), and engagin g in care coordination (Green et al., 2015). Regulations are in place that would allow a more direct intervention of pharmacists in the management of OUD medications as part of a treatment team (Bluml, 2005; CMS, 2016a; Giberson et collaborative buprenorphine maintenance practice piloted at the same clinical setting with the help of a medical assistant has suggested that patient care can be improved by providing a treatment continuum (DiPaula & Menachery, 2015). Benefits in cluded enhanced communication, reduced physician burden, enhanced monitoring for diversion, and reduced cost (DiPaula & Menachery, 2015). When patients initiate OBBT for OUD, they are expected to refill their buprenorphine medications approximately monthly and may receive medication use counseling at the pharmacy. The regular frequency with which patients visit the pharmacy to obtain buprenorphine refills offers an opportunity to evaluate pharmacy -based OUD care, including pharmacist -operated medication management under the supervision of a physician. Figure 1. The conceptual model of physician -pharmacist collaboration in the management of patients with opioid use disorder 2.2.1 Overview of Study Design Study design: For the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of and obtaining operational information to guide a future multi -site RCT of pharmacy -based OUD care, we will implement a non -randomized prospective study design that will take place over a period of approximately 16 -19 months. The overarching goal of the study is to explore the feasibility of the pilot physician -pharmacist Patient OUD treatment initiation : office - based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) clinicians initiate OBBT and prescribe buprenorphine. Continuation of OUD care via health promotion practice: pharmacists dispense medications, monitor Rx use and other risks ( e.g., via urine drug testing), and conduct interventions or referrals. Outcome evaluation : OBBT provider's views Pharmacist's views Patient self - reports Clinical outcomes Coordinated care between OBBT physicians ( prescribers) & pharmacists ( dispensers ) CTN-0075 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 5 collaborative OU D care model, as well as OUD treatment outcomes and safety measures. In this study, pharmacists are defined broadly as community pharmacists . The intent to include a range of treatment settings and choosing community pharmacists versus a smaller subset of clinical pharmacists is related to generalizability. In particular, the model of collaboration is designed to follow general guidelines and be applicable to the participation of pharmacists in other states across the U.S. The community pharmacist and the local pharmacy store are ubiquitous, similar to the mailman and post office. The identification of community retail pharmacists and pharmacies to be involved with buprenorphine treatment management guarantees a basic level of generalizability to the desig n and potential significance to feasibility data gathered in this pilot study. Study sites : Approximately 3 -4 outpatient or ambulatory clinical sites will be included in this pilot study in order to explore the feasibility of implementing the interventional model in different clinical environments (e.g., academic, community -based, primary care). Each clinical site may include up to 4 buprenorphine physicians. A pharmacy typically includes 2 or 3 pharm acists, and buprenorphine physicians often have established working relationships with certain pharmacies. To reflect the real-world situation, up to 4 buprenorphine physicians at one site will collaborate with up to 3 pharmacists at a pharmacy in the mana gement of patients with OUD. Study Population and Sample Size : 1. Taking into account study attrition or dropout (Marcovitz et al., 2016; Soyka et al., 2008), approximately up to 140 adults aged 18 or older with DSM -5 OUD (defined by DSM -5 OUD Checklist) w ho are stabilized on buprenorphine may be consented in this study over a period of approximately 6 -7 months at 3 -4 buprenorphine clinic sites in order for 70 participants to be enrolled in the maintenance phase. 2. Approximately 6 -12 (3 -4 sites) OBBT physici ans: Each study physician may enroll 10 or more patients over a period of 6 -7 months to meet the goal for enrolling up to 70 participants (i.e., defined as meeting the study eligibility and enrolling into the maintenance phase). Each OBBT practice requires at least 2 OBBT physicians to participate in the study to reflect the real -life situation. 3. Approximately 6 -12 pharmacists (up to 3 community pharmacists at a pharmacy). Study Intervention/Pharmacy OUD care: An Operational Care Agreement (see SOP for O CA in the MOP) is used to specify the pharmacist - provided patient care services that will be supervised by buprenorphine physicians.

Participants will be consented and enrolled on a rolling basis. Eligible participants may be consented as early as the beginning of the stabilization phase, upon the suggestion of the trea ting buprenorphine physician. Consented participants will not start pharmacy OUD management care until the stabilization phase ends, when they will be enrolled into the maintenance phase of the study. Pharmacists must complete the Pharmacist Coaching Train ing Phase before participating in the Pharmacy OUD Maintenance Care Phase. Study duration: Each paired study site will start study recruitment on a rolling basis, contingent on the timing of completing site initiation requirements. The estimated total st udy duration will be approximately 16-19 months. Given the variation across study sites in completing study training and participant enrollment, the duration of study duration will vary by study site. The study will consist of four overlapping phases: 1. Pharmacist Coaching Phase : It may take 3 -6 months for all pharmacists and physicians to complete the coaching phase as specified by the SOP for Pharmacist Coaching in the MOP (3 -6 months per pharmacist). 2. Consent and Enrollment Phase : Patients with OUD who ar e considered clinically stabilized and in OUD treatment for no more than 12 months since the start of the current OUD treatment episode will be recruited and consented. Participants will be consented in the study during their stabilization visits and enrol led in the maintenance phase at the end of their stabilization visits. Enrollment will be completed on a rolling basis. It may take 6 -7 months for all participants to be consented and enrolled. 3. Pharmacy OUD Care Phase : This phase includes 6 monthly visit s at the pharmacy. It will take about 13 months for all participants to complete this phase (6 months per participant). 4. EHR Data Collection and Analysis Phase : This phase involves the comparison of Buprenorphine Visit Checklist outcomes between study part icipants and matched nonpharmacy treated patients using medical record data, if available. Data from this phase will be utilized as part of the exploratory analyses. Each participant will be asked to participate in this study for approximately 28 -78 weeks. This range accounts for differences in the timing of study enrollment and individual differences in each participant's buprenorphine treatment schedule (e.g., within 12 months since the start of the current OUD treatment episode). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 7 Rationale for st udy duration: 1. Pharmacist Coaching Phase : The coaching phase will include sufficient time for individual education and training, test taking, and coaching meetings (at least 1 -2 per month). Based on the coaching plan, it is estimated that each pharmacist may complete coaching within 3 -6 months. 2. Consent and Enrollment Phase (to be completed during the OBBT care stabilization period) : Based on the time allotted for consent and enrollment, it is estimated that each study site may recruit about 4 -6 participa nts per month, or approximately 2 -3 participants per buprenorphine prescribing physician per month. Potential participants will be prescreened and consented (i.e., sign the informed consent form) before the end of the stabilization period. The buprenorphin e stabilization phase may take around 2 -4 months per patient. However, the duration can vary depending on individual clinical conditions, with some patients needing more clinical monitoring by the buprenorphine physician and/or a longer time to be consider ed clinically stabilized. Thus, participant recruitment and consent may start before the stabilization phase is completed, and it will include patients receiving buprenorphine treatment for no more than 12 months for the current OUD treatment episode. The stabilization visit (Intake/Baseline) at the buprenorphine treatment clinic will be included among the study visits to establish treatment continuity with the subsequent pharmacist visits, as the participant is enrolled into the maintenance phase of the st udy. 3. Pharmacy OUD Care Phase (Maintenance) : Following buprenorphine induction and stabilization, maintenance visits will occur for 6 months, as this length of time is considered to be an adequate observation period to detect changes in treatment outcome a mong patients receiving OBBT for OUD (Mattick et al., 2014; Potter et al., Soyka et al., 2008; Fiellin et al., 2006; Schottenfeld et al., 2005). From the buprenorphine physician standpoint, the proposed observation time seems adequate to explore the ability of a pharmacist to manage and comply with a range of clinical scenarios and potential challenges offered by office -based buprenorphine treatment. 2.3 Outcome Assessments One of the primary goals of the study is to monitor and reduce opioid and other drug use, as well as to explore the possibility of doing so with the help of the pharmacist. Outcome assessments will be conducted at each monthly visit throughout the maintenance phase of the study. Where applicable, assessments will be completed du ring the screening/baseline phase (following consent) to establish a baseline. Assessments will focus mainly on the feasibility and treatment outcome measures, which include the following: Primary: Rate of recruitment among patients with OUD, defined as the number of participants recruited (i.e., signed the informed consent form) per month and by site. The average monthly rate of participants entering the maintenance phase among potential participants who were consented will also be calculated. We will al so evaluate the number of potential participants pre -screened and the reasons for pre -screen failure and screen failure. Treatment retention: proportion of scheduled visits completed for Visit 2 through Visit 7. Opioid and other substance use: measured v ia urine drug screen and self -report (Timeline Followback). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 8 Medication compliance: measured by film count/dose reconciliation at each visit (proportion of expected buprenorphine use in relation to actual use). Secondary: Treatment fidelity: adherence of physician and pharmacist to the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist using the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form. Indicators of satisfaction with treatment delivery measured by participants, pharmacists, and physicians using the Treatment Satisfactio n Survey. Participant safety measures over time: fatal and non -fatal substance -related overdoses and substance -related emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations, measured by self - report. Pharmacist's use of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Pro gram (PDMP) and communications with the physician(s) to address PDMP reports at each visit, measured via self-report. Preliminary/exploratory: Pharmacist's use of the EHR and PDMP to capture and monitor treatment outcome measures. Binary outcomes will be identified at each visit for measures from the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist that can be captured by or are missing from EHR, and their overlay with measures explored by the PDMP will be identified in a similar binary fashion. This outcome will only be assessed if EHR data are available. Use of the EHR to compare treatment outcome measures. A comparison of Buprenorphine Visit Checklist outcomes may be performed between study participants and matched non -pharmacy treated patients, if EHR data are available. Depending on the access to the EHR, the EHR -related data elements may be collected by medical record abstraction. Safety Reporting: For th e purposes of this protocol, the collection and reporting of safety events will be limited to those collected on the Safety Event Response Checklist (see Section 10.5), including overdoses and death of any participant who provided informed consent. This in cludes any substance use -related ED visits and hospitalizations. The Safety Event Response Checklist will be available to report any safety events that occur during the course of the study. 2.4 Analyses Because this is a non -randomized pilot study with a small sample size, descriptive analyses will be conducted to describe distributions of primary, secondary, and exploratory outcome measures. Random effects models will be considered and used to assess outcomes that are measure d repeatedly throughout the maintenance phase. 3.0 STUDY FLOWCHART CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 9 4.0 INTRODUCTION AND SIGNIFICANCE 4.1 Prescription (Rx) Opioid and Heroin Overdose Epidemic Rx drug misuse and addiction is an epidemic, and Rx drug overdose (mainly opioi ds) is a leading cause of accidental death in the United States (CDC, 2012; Volkow et al., 2014). The opioid overdose epidemic has been escalating continuously for over a decade (Straus et al., 2013; Rudd et al., 2016). Rx opioid misuse is linked with a su rge of heroin use and serious heroin use problems (Pollini et al ., 2011; Compton et al ., 2016). Between 2010 and 2013, the rate of heroininvolved deaths almost tripled; non -Hispanic whites and adults aged 18 -44 had the highest opioidinvolved death rate (He degaard et al., 2015). Most people who die from Rx opioid/heroin CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 10 overdose have been found to be adults 25 -64 years old, non -Hispanic whites, or men; moreover, the mortality rate among women in recent years has increased rapidly to approach the rate among men (CDC, 2013a, 2015). Likewise, there has been an increase in opioid -involved treatment admissions to EDs and SUD treatment facilities (Crane, 2015; SAMHSA, 2015). The rise in rates of opioid overdose deaths is related to a parallel increase in the avail ability of Rx and illicit opioids (including heroin), as well as the prescribing practices of some physicians (Paulozzi et al., 2012; Rudd et al., 2016). Physicians are a leading source of Rx opioids for highrisk opioid users (CDC, 2012). Nonmedical opioid users, characterized by frequent use of nonmedical opioids, have been found to be likely to obtain opioids from a physician's prescription or from a drug dealer (Jones et al., 2014). About 20% of the patients who were prescribed opioids have been prescrib ed high doses by either one or more physicians, and these patients were at a much higher risk for opioid -related overdoses (CDC, 2012). Prior data also suggested that about 25 - 66% of individuals who died of Rx drug overdoses used opioids prescribed to some one else (CDC, 2012). Opioid diversion or sharing is among the contributors to the opioid overdose epidemic (Paulozzi, 2012). Other clinical factors that may increase the likelihood of opioid overdoses include: medical conditions (especially chronic pain), use of high daily doses of opioids, history of mental health or psychiatric problems, substance misuse or SUD, co -use of opioids and benzodiazepines/sedatives, co -use of opioids and Pharmacists' unique responsibilities and expertise in dispensing medications, conducting medication management or counseling (especially for chronic conditions) , as well as their increased interest in participating in efforts aimed at reducing Rx opioid overdose deaths provide strong foundations to include pharmacists in addiction research and OUD interventions (APhA, 2014). Pharmacists dispense Rx medications (e .g., opioids, naloxone) and have regular contact with patients at risk for opioid overdose. They are especially well -positioned to counsel patients and caregivers about opioid safety and provide naloxone rescue kits to the community. One key priority for combating the epidemic of opioid overdoses and addiction is to improve the access to medication -assisted treatment (MAT), especially OBBT, for people with OUD (Jones et al., 2015; Volkow et al. , 2014). In 2015, an estimated 2 million Americans had prescrip tion OUD in the past year, and about 0.6 million Americans had heroin use disorder in the past year (CBHSQ, 2016). Among persons with OUD in the past year, approximately 82% had prescription OUD only, 10% had heroin use disorder only, and 8% had both presc ription OUD and heroin use disorder. Of persons with past -year OUD (prescription opioid or heroin use disorder), only about 26% received any type of alcohol or substance use treatment services in the past year, and only 19% received opioid -specific treatme nt (Wu et al., 2016). The low rate of service use for OUD is pervasive across all racial/ethnical groups; furthermore, this underutilization is the most marked amongst the uninsured, members of minority groups, and persons with prescription OUD only (i.e., without concurrent heroin use disorder) (Wu et al., 2016). One major barrier to expanding Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) for OUD is related to the limited number of buprenorphine providers who are available and willing to treat OUD with MAT (Jones et al., 2015). Non -metropolitan or rural areas have relatively high rates of opioid overdose deaths, but residents in these areas face additional barriers to receiving OUD treatment due to a greater shortage of mental health and/or SUD providers (CDC, 2012; Quest et al ., 2012; Rosenblatt et al., 2015). There is a pressing need to identify collaborative care models that can enhance the buprenorphine -waivered physicians' capability to effectively treat people with OUD CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 11 and to ensure that these models are applic able to remote areas where the access to buprenorphine -waivered physicians is limited. The main objective of the proposed physicianpharmacist collaborative care model is to address the significant barrier in the shortage of OBBT providers in the rural or r emote areas by increasing pharmacists' skills in managing patients with OUD. Because this is a new area of addiction research, a pilot study that is focused on exploring the feasibility of study recruitment and other study operations is considered appropri ate. OUD is a chronic disorder that is often complicated by comorbidities (Wu et al., 2011a, 2011b). Adults with either prescription opioid or heroin use disorder tend to have an onset of OUD in their early 20s and experience more than one disorder episode, from which it may take up to 6 -10 years to recover (Wu et al., 2011a, 2011b). The monitoring requirements for buprenorphine treatment (which encompass an extende d period of OUD treatment), unique medication properties, and risk for diversion justify a significant role for pharmacist intervention. Pharmacists are well -versed in preventative care, patient counseling, and medication education to improve medication ad herence and patient safety. Clinical trials have found that pharmacist interventions or pharmacist -provided patient care can improve chronic disease management and patient outcomes (e.g., medication adherence, patient knowledge, quality of life or general health status), and such pharmacist interventions appear to work best when pharmacists work collaboratively with primary care providers (Chisholm -Burns et al., 2010; O'Malley, 2011; Tsuyuki et al., 2002). In light of increased concerns for primary care p hysician shortage, physician -pharmacist collaborative care models are considered an important solution for meeting patients' primary care service needs and mitigating potential adverse effects due to physician shortage (Smith et al., 2013). In the U.S., th e supply of pharmacists is growing progressively (HHS, 2008). The total active pharmacist supply is projected to grow from 226,000 in 2004 to 305,000 by 2020 and 368,000 by 2030. The number of full -time-equivalent pharmacists is projected to grow from 191,200 in 2004 to 260,000 by 2020 and 319,000 by 2030 (HHS, 2008). Conversely, the U.S. is facing an increased level of primary care physician shortage. The demand for physicians has continued to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected shortfall of be tween 46,100 and 90,400 physicians (12,500 to 31,100 of which are primary care physicians) by 2025 (AAMC, 2015). When pharmacists are part of a healthcare team, they can reduce the physician burden by supporting a patient -centered care approach, lowering the cost but not the quality of care (CPNP, 2016). Pharmacists' patient care process and strategies may include: applying evidence -based practices, collecting and assessing subjective and objective information about the patient to develop and implement an individualized plan, monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the care plan, and modifying the plan in collaboration with other health care professionals and the patient as needed (JCPP 2014; ASHP 2014). Putting a pharmacist on a healthcare team can reduce adverse drug reactions and lower costs (CDC, 2013b). If patients can go to a pharmacist for day -to-day medication -related management of their non -urgent conditions, physicians can spend more time seeing patients that really need their expertise (CDC , 2013b; Smith et al., 2013). One codified approach to meet the goals of improving patient outcomes and reducing primary care physician burden is with a Collaborative Practice Agreement (CPA) between pharmacists and other health care physicians (CDC, 2013 b). The CPA is a formal agreement in which a licensed physician makes a diagnosis, supervises patient care, and refers patients to a pharmacist under a protocol that allows the pharmacist to perform specific patient care functions (CDC, 2013b). Under the c onditions of this agreement, the pharmacists' patient care services and tasks can be specified by the following terms (CDC, 2013b): CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 12 Medication Therapy Management (MTM) : MTM is a distinct service or group of services that optimizes therapeutic outcomes for individual patients (Bluml, 2005). MTM includes five core elements: medication therapy review, personal medication record, medicationrelated action plan, intervention and/or referral, and documentation and follow -up. Collaborative Drug Therapy Managemen t (CDTM) : CDTM is a collaborative practice agreement between one or more providers and pharmacists in which qualified pharmacists working within the context of a defined protocol are permitted to assume professional responsibility for performing patient as sessments, counseling, and referrals; ordering laboratory tests; administering medication; and selecting, initiating, monitoring, continuing, and adjusting medication regimens. In most states the law explicitly authorizes CPAs; in the majority of cases, it allows the pharmacist to provide MTM and CDTM, including, but not limited to, those providing direct contact with the prescribing physician (CDC, 2013b). The earlier Asheville Projects of pharmacist interventions in a collaborative healthcare team for d iabetes, hypertension, and asthma care management in North Carolina demonstrated the feasibility and success of implementing pharmacist -provided care in improving clinical outcomes and lowering costs of care (Bunting et al., 2006, 2008; Cranor et al., 2003 ; Fera et al., 2009). Asheville Projects' success has inspired the development of similar efforts (e.g., MTM, CDTM) by the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) and others (Smith, 2009). The Asheville Projects' model showed significant savings on overall health spending and improved patient health (e.g., a significant reduction in the number of sick days) (CDC, 2013b). Guided by the CPA, pharmacy health promotion practices, and OBBT guidelines, this pilot study will explore the feasibility of a physician and pharmacist collaborative care model that is defined by an Operational Care Agreement (OCA) between OBBT physicians and community pharmacies (APhA, 2014; Bluml, 2005; al., 2015; Kampman and Jarvis, 2015). Sta te-specific requirements of a CPA can limit the generalizability of the proposed study to other states. In addition, the national epidemic of opioid overdoses suggests the need for developing a feasible collaborative care model that can be applicable and a cceptable to the general community pharmacists in order to increase its adoption and subsequent implementation. Thus, this pilot study seeks to explore the feasibility of a collaborative care model defined by an Operational Care Agreement that incorporates evidence -based OUD management care into the regular scope of community pharmacy practices, which fit into what pharmacists are doing or are prepared to do. An Operational Care Agreement between one or more buprenorphine physicians and pharmacists is devel oped to operationalize tasks and responsibilities in the management of patients with OUD for this pilot study (APhA, 2014; Bluml, 2005; CMS, 2016a; Green et al., 2015; Kampman and Jarvis, 2015). Involvement of pharmacists with OUD treatment: Recent fede ral opioid initiatives and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 provide a framework to promote pharmacists' expanded roles in providing patient care activities to prevent opioid overdoses and improving OUD treatment (such as expanding acces s to naloxone and allowing partial fills for Schedule II controlled substances). The growing importance of pharmacists' roles for OUD management is confirmed in the 2016 guideline document 'Opioid Use Disorders: Interventions for Community Pharmacists' (CP NP, 2016), which indicates a stepby -step process for managing safe and appropriate access to opioids while protecting the public from the hazard of prescription misuse and addiction. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 13 The clinical importance of pharmacist support in OUD treatment managemen t has been explored in the literature. In France, community pharmacies routinely supervise buprenorphine dosing. In addition to being supportive of primary care physicians in prescribing buprenorphine, this supervision has been found as useful as urine mon itoring of drug use in preventing diversion/misuse (Fatseas and Auriacombe, 2007). Opportunities for pharmacy involvement have received preliminary evaluation in the United States. A survey of 179 pharmacies found that 77% were willing to participate in di spensing buprenorphine (Lofwall et al., 2010). Some reasons for limited interest from pharmacies included not stocking buprenorphine, being too busy, or having insufficient staff, which highlight the importance of a concerted effort held by a healthcare te am. One study has suggested that close collaboration between pharmacists and physicians contributes to a reduction in the physician's visit time and buprenorphine treatment cost (DiPaula and Menachery, 2015). A similar physician and pharmacist coordinated care model was utilized in the management of a methadone program in primary care with comparable positive results (Merril et al., 2005). These available but limited studies on OUD care support the proposed pilot study of a collaborative OBBT -physician and pharmacist OUD care model. Taken together and given the high prevalence of untreated OUD and the relatively low number of available OBBT providers, there is a critical need to develop coordinated care models that can mitigate the shortage of OBBT provide rs by improving buprenorphine -waivered physicians' efficiency in managing OUD treatment and follow -up care (e.g., increasing the number of the patients with OUD treated by an OBBT provider). Community pharmacists' expertise in pharmacotherapy management an d monitoring, medication education, and care coordination can assist with OUD care management, which may contribute to the efficient delivery of OUD care (APhA, 2014; DiPaula and Menachery, 2015). 4.2 Significance to the Field and Sustainability To help combat the opioid epidemic, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a new rule in 2016 to allow qualified physicians to increase the total number of patients with OUD that they can treat with buprenorphine from 100 to 275 (F ederal Register, 2016). The U.S. House of Representatives (2016) approved the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to promote a multi -faceted federal response to addressing the opioid epidemic, and which considers pharmacists key players of a healthcar e team in curbing the opioid overdose epidemic (APhA, 2016a). Although the federal initiatives in supporting the expansion of OBBT are critical to improving OUD care (Stein et al., 2012), useful care models that can increase the efficiency of delivering th e OBBT care to reach patients with OUD are needed to realize the stated goal. Pharmacists are the most accessible and convenient resources of healthcare professionals. Over 60% of pharmacists reported that they could provide care for a minimum of 11 pati ents and up to 100 patients per week (APhA, 2016b). Thus, the clinical significance of this pilot study is to explore a coordinated physician -pharmacist OBBT care model that can shift the work burden from OBBT physicians by enabling them to treat a higher number of patients with OUD while helping pharmacists develop OUD and SUD care skills and management. Because of the ubiquity of community pharmacies, such a coordinated physician -pharmacist care model could be further expanded and tested in future RCTs to determine the involvement of pharmacists with patient evaluation, buprenorphine induction, and delivery of OUD treatment in rural areas with reduced access to direct physician care to improve OUD treatment. As shown from the \"landmark\" Asheville Projects , the sustainability of the proposed pharmacy OUD care model will need to be evaluated from a value -based care program perspective (Bunting et al., 2008; Cranor et al., 2003; CDC, 2013b). The outcome will measure indicators of better CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 14 health, better care, a nd lower costs (CMS, 2016b). This pilot test will focus on the feasibility and indicators of health and healthcare status. The results will be used to design a full RCT to evaluate full indicators of a value -based care model for informing sustainability an d health policy. Although a cost analysis will not be implemented in the pilot study, it is appropriate for the future full RCT. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and private insurance programs have supported the pharmacists' MTM for qua lified patients in an attempt to improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce the risk of adverse events, and lower cost (CMS, 2016a). Pharmacist collaborative care agreements have been implemented nationally and promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention (CDC, 2013b). Given that opioid overdose and addiction are among the most pressing public health crises in the nation, these multiple factors indicate the promise of sustainability. 4.3 Policy Support for Transforming Pharmacy Practices to Addre ss OUD Pharmacists not only dispense opioids and other medications, but also can be involved in educating patients about safe medication practices and medication storage and disposal, identifying red flags of diversion or improper prescribing for further evaluation, and engaging in care coordination (Green et al ., 2015). The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has promoted efforts to expand the role of the pharmacist from a primary medication dispenser to a patient -centered care provider, which encoura ges pharmacists to use a team -based approach to engage patients in their pharmacy practice and optimize medication outcomes (APhA, 2014, 2016b). One key focus of this expanded role is to increase training and education in prescription drug abuse and addict ion for pharmacists, in order to facilitate the use of strategies or tools to address opioid addiction (APhA, 2014). Likewise, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) announced that 54 colleges and schools of pharmacy have committed to joining the fight against prescription drug abuse by educating and training student pharmacists about lifesaving overdose interventions, including how to counsel patients and their family members on appropriate use of lifesaving medications (AACP, 2016). Furthermore, recent healthcare reforms (e.g., the Affordable Care Act) have shifted the landscape of healthcare delivery towards an integrated or coordinated model (e.g., medical homes, community -based care delivery models) by promoting the provision of the f ull spectrum care in order to improve the overall population health management. As a result, pharmacists have been progressively recognized as integrated members of team -based care delivery models, as they can provide some primary care services to meet the increased demands for primary care services. They can accomplish this by engaging in coordinated care across multiple settings to increase the efficiency in patient care and to mitigate the shortage of primary care providers (Smith et al., 2013). Existing medical and OUD evidence suggests that the pharmacist can meet the challenges of managing buprenorphine treatment of OUD within the framework and specifications of a collaborative care agreement (APhA, 2014; CDC, 2013b; DiPaula and Menachery, 2015). Goal of this pilot study: Community pharmacists are an under -utilized resource for healthcare professionals in the OUD management efforts. A survey about pharmacists' perceptions and attitudes toward dispensing buprenorphine to patients with OUD suggested that pharmacists expressed positive attitudes towards patients treated for OUD with buprenorphine (Raisch et al., 2005). The available resear ch data provides the support to conduct a pilot study of the pharmacy -based coordinated OUD care model. The study goal is guided by the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process Model ( Figure 2 ) (JCPP, 2014). The overall findings from this pilot study will be used to guide NIDA CTN's further CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 15 research designs, intervention components, and/or treatment approaches within pharmacy settings that are acceptable to pharmacists and feasible within pharmacy practices (JCPP, 2014). Figure 2. Pharmacists' Patient Care Proc ess Model Collect The pharmacist collects subjective and objective information about the patient. Assess The pharmacist assesses and analyzes the information in the context of the patient's health goals. Plan The pharmacist develops an individual patient -centered care plan. Implement The pharmacist implements the plan with other healthcare professionals and the patient. Follow -up: Monitor and Evaluate The pharmacist monitors and evaluates the plan's effec tiveness and helps make modifications as needed. 5.0 OBJECTIVES 5.1 Primary Objectives The overarching goal of this pharmacy OUD care pilot study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of shifting the OBBT of OUD from physician to pharmacist care in order to inform the development of a future multi -site RCT. We will achieve this goal by pursuing four primary pilot study objectives. Specific measures of study objectives outcomes are defined in Section 8.0. 1. Calculate the rate of recruitment among patients with OUD, defined as the number of participants recruited (i.e., signed the informed consent form) per month and by site. The average monthly rate of participants entering the maintenance phase among potenti al participants who were consented will also be calculated. The number of potential participants pre -screened and the reasons for pre -screen failure and screen failure will also be evaluated. 2. Examine retention in treatment, as determined by the proportion of scheduled visits completed for Visit 2 through Visit 7. 3. Examine prevalence of use of opioids/heroin and other substances, measured by the proportion of positive urine drug screens (UDS) at each visit and days of use of CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 16 opioids/heroin, and other substa nces as collected on Timeline Followback (TLFB) over the study duration. 4. Determine medication compliance, measured by film count/dose reconciliation at each visit (proportion of expected buprenorphine use in relation to actual use). 5.2 Secondary Objec tives The secondary objectives are to generate point estimates for: 1. Treatment fidelity: adherence of physician and pharmacist to the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist (Section 10.4) as recorded on the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form (Section 10.6): proport ion of visits showing 80% adherence or higher (Borrelli, 2011). 2. Indicators of satisfaction with treatment delivery by participants measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Survey (adapted from Harland et al., 2005) at each visit: proportion of visits in which raters are satisfied (score of 4 on a Likert Scale of 1 -5) or very satisfied (score of 5 on a Likert Scale of 1 -5). Pharmacist and physician satisfaction with treatment delivery measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Survey on a monthly basis, an d a proportion of physician and pharmacist monthly ratings of satisfied or very satisfied will be calculated. 3. Participant safety, as measured by: a) Any fatal or non -fatal substance -related overdose measured by self -report. b) Any substance -related ED visit or hospitalization, measured by self -report. 4. Pharmacist's use of the PDMP and communications with physician to address PDMP reports including measures of multiple buprenorphine prescriptions, other class II and III medication prescriptions ( e.g., communicate with physician to address PDMP reports and record it on the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist at each visit). 5.3 Preliminary/Exploratory Objectives 1. Pharmacist's use of the EHR to capture and monitor treatment outcome measures (monthly m easures during the pharmacist OUD management phase). Binary outcomes will be identified at each visit for measures from the visit checklist, and their overlay with measures explored by the PDMP will be identified in a similar fashion. This outcome will only be assessed if EHR data are available. 2. Use of the EHR to compare treatment outcome measures. A comparison of visit checklist outcomes may be performed between study participants and matched non - pharmacy treated patients, if EHR data are available. Depe nding on the access to the EHR, these EHR data will be collected by medical record abstraction. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 17 6.0 STUDY DESIGN 6.1 Overview of Study Design This pilot study is not designed to evaluate hypotheses. Given that the proposed study is a new area for the NIDA CTN and that it requires collaborative efforts among health professionals at multiple settings, the focus of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility and understand operational processes and potential challenges. Specifically, this pilot st udy is designed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of transferring OBBT of OUD from physician to pharmacist care and to inform the development of a future multi -site RCT that will compare physician -based and physician -pharmacist -collaborative OUD buprenorphine treatment. To maximize efficiency of research funding, we have selected design and measures to most effectively assess different aspects of the study. We have also considered the structure and organization of an OBBT physician office and of a community pharmacy in the real -world setting. We will track recruitment, reasons for pre -screen and screen failure, and request the feedback of study participants, buprenorphine physicians and pharmacists regarding satisfaction with treatment. Further, buprenorphine physicians and pharmacists will be asked to provide feedback on their satisfaction of the training/coaching process that will be utilized in the study. Because the study seeks to improve both the quality of OUD care and the involvement of phar macists in OUD care, the OUD clinic care team and research staff will interact with community pharmacies based on an Operational Care Agreement. Although generalizability is not the main focus of the pilot study, we have incorporated key components to enh ance the applicability and clinical utility of study results. First, we plan to include pharmacies that will collaborate with academic and non -academic sites. The diversity in setting is related to generalizability. Second, we will recruit \"the general com munity pharmacists\" to participate in this pilot study (i.e., any licensed pharmacist at an eligible site), and it will not be limited by a smaller subset of clinical pharmacists. In addition, our proposed 'physician -pharmacist care agreement' is designed to follow general clinical guidelines for community pharmacists that will allow community pharmacists to incorporate health care for patients receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder into their practice. This physician -pharmacist care agreement mode l will be applicable to pharmacists in other states across the country. We will track the problems encountered during the implementation of the study, including organizational readiness to deliver Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) services with feedback from physicians, pharmacists and participants, as well as operational feedback or comments from research staff members (e.g., issues discussed during regular project calls). A brief survey questionnaire will be developed to collect such information from physicians and pharmacists. We will discuss possible solutions and recommendations at the regular project meetings and summarize them in the final study report. Study setting: Approximately up to 4 clinical s ites - including approximately up to 4 pharmacy sites - will be included in this pilot study in order to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the interventional model in different clinical environments (e.g., academic, community -based, primary care ). Based on the practice considerations that 2 or more buprenorphine physicians often work together at a clinical site and that patients tend to have a regular pharmacy for refilling buprenorphine prescriptions, this pilot study will explore a collaborativ e care model between 2 or more buprenorphine physicians and pharmacists at a community pharmacy setting. In order to test the reproducibility and generalizability of the pilot study intervention in a future study, an Operational CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 18 Care Agreement (see SOP for OCA in the MOP) will be adopted to define and specify the pharmacist -provided patient care services that will be recognized by physicians, consistent with evidence -based OBBT of OUD. This pilot also will explore the use of the PDMP for OBBT care by phys icians and pharmacists, and whether pharmacists have access to the EHR. Pilot data have shown the workflow, ease of use, and added technical value of presenting PDMP data in the EHR system by integrating the EHR and PDMP systems (Indiana, PDMP -INSPECT 2102 ). However, simultaneous use of the PDMP and EHR is typically limited to ED settings and has only been achieved through separate access to each system (i.e., the systems have not yet been successfully combined) (GreenwoodEricksen et al., 2016; SAMHSA, 201 3). Design: This pilot study consists of a single -arm, 24 -week (pharmacist OUD maintenance intervention), open -label, pilot study of pharmacist -provided buprenorphine maintenance treatment of OUD. Study participants and enrollment: Study participants will be adults aged 18 years with OUD who have completed buprenorphine induction at the study clinical sites. We will track the rate of participant recruitment (approximately up to 140 adults may be consented in order to enroll 70 participants into the s tudy maintenance phase) and retention in treatment to estimate the duration of study recruitment and treatment required for a future multi -site RCT. Participants will be considered \"recruited\" once they have signed the informed consent form. The proposed s ample size takes into account possible attrition during the early stage of the study, as prior studies suggest that approximately up to 50% of participants may drop out at some point during 6 months of treatment. Of note, approximately 30% to 40% of the pa rticipants that drop out are usually lost to follow up in the induction -early stabilization phases of buprenorphine treatment (Marcovitz et al., 2016; Soyka et al., 2008). If the study timeline allows, additional participants will be recruited with the mai n intent to replace participants who discontinue from the study early (i.e., prior to Visit 2 or 3). Although all pharmacists are expected to complete the pharmacist training and coaching on buprenorphine treatment within 3 -6 months, it is anticipated that pharmacists may complete this training after 34 months. Thus, study recruitment may begin as early as the 3rd or 4th month. Pharmacists must successfully complete the buprenorphine treatment coaching phase before they can begin the pharmacist intervention . The study will recruit and consent patients with OUD that have been considered clinically stabilized and in the OUD treatment for no more than 12 months since the start of the current OUD treatment episode. During the stabilization phase, participants m ay be recruited into the study (i.e., complete the informed consent process and begin preliminary study assessments) before the last stabilization visit. The screening/intake and baseline assessments, together referred to as Visit 1 or the Intake/Baseline Visit, may be completed on more than one occasion within a short period of time, depending on the participant's schedule. The Intake/Baseline Visit will include the stabilization visit at the OBBT physician's office. Following completion of buprenorphine s tabilization, participants will be transitioned to maintenance visits with the pharmacist. During this maintenance period, each participant will complete 6 monthly visits (i.e., every 4 weeks) at the pharmacy for buprenorphine management. Each of these 6 v isits with the pharmacist will include the following procedures and assessments: collection of urine samples to confirm self -reported substance use/abstinence, medication compliance through recount and reconciliation, safety event assessment, psychosocial treatment engagement, and treatment satisfaction assessment. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 19 Primary outcomes: Primary outcomes of treatment participation retention at 24 weeks, opioid and other substance use, and medication compliance will be assessed at each visit. 6.2 Duration of Study and Visit Schedule Taking into account study attrition or dropout, approximately up to 70 adults stablized on buprenorphine may be consented and enrolled in the maintenance phase of the study over a period of approximately 6 -7 months at 3 -4 bupr enorphine clinic sites. Each participant may be engaged in the overall study for approximately 28 -40 weeks as follows: Approximately 4 -8 weeks: pre -screening, consent, and screening (beginning as early as the first stabilization visit) , including the time for buprenorphine stabilization. It is possible that this period may last up to 16 weeks. Once all study eligbility criteria are confirmed, the participant may proceed to enrollment into the maintenance phase of the study. 24 weeks ( 6 visits total): maintenance treatment with monthly study visits. Buprenorphine physicians and community pharmacists will be involved with the study for an additional 3 -6 months of education, training, and coaching (see Table 1 ). This coaching/training phase will be completed prior to enrolling the first study participant. 6.3 The Rationale for Study Duration (24-week pharmacy OUD intervention and timing of pharmacist treatment initiation) Study time periods have been developed to facilitate the participation of otherwise busy professionals and reproduce 'real world' clinical conditions. The coaching phase is designed to include sufficient time for individual education and training, test tak ing, and coaching meetings (at least 1 -2 per month). Based on the time allotted for consent and enrollment, it is estimated that each study site may recruit about 4 -6 participants per month, or approximately 2 -3 participants per buprenorphine prescribing p hysician per month. The buprenorphine stabilization phase may take 2 -4 months. However, the duration can vary depending on the individual clinical conditions, with some patients needing more clinical monitoring by the buprenorphine physician, and/or more time to be considered clinically stabilized. Thus, participant recruitment and consent may start before the stabilization phase is completed, and it will include patients receiving buprenorphine treatment for no more than 12 months for the current OUD treat ment episode. Depending on the participant's schedule, baseline assessments may be completed over multiple visits to the OBBT clinic. The stabilization visit at the buprenorphine treatment clinic (Intake/Baseline) will be included among the study visits to establish treatment continuity with the subsequent pharmacist visits. The main purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of shifting the OBBT of OUD from physician to pharmacist in order to inform the development of a futu re multisite trial. We have, therefore, opted to study the phase of buprenorphine maintenance and test the aptitude of the pharmacist in managing treatment once the patient is considered clinically stabilized. A length of 24 weeks for the pharmacy OUD inte rvention allows sufficient time for detecting significant changes in outcomes as suggested in the literature (Mattick et al., 2014; Potter et al., 2013; Soyka et al., 2008; Fiellin et al., 2006; Schottenfeld al., 2005) and by clinical experien ce. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 20 7.0 STUDY POPULATION Taking into account study attrition or dropout (Marcovitz et al ., 2016; Soyka et al ., 2008), approximately up to 70 adults stabilized on buprenorphine may be consented and enrolled in this study (i.e., defined as meeting the stu dy eligibility and enrolling into the study maintenance phase) over a period of approximately 6 -7 months at 3 -4 buprenorphine clinic sites. 7.1 Inclusion Criteria Individuals participating in the pilot study must: 1. Be adults aged 18 years or older. 2. If female, use adequate birth control methods. 3. Meet DSM -5 criteria for past -year OUD. 4. Have completed buprenorphine induction for OUD. 5. Have expressed the intention to receive maintenance ( 6 months) buprenorphine treatment. 6. Be willing to receive pharm acist administered buprenorphine maintenance treatment. 7. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. 8. Be able to read and communicate in English. 9. Be able to comply with buprenorphine treatment policies. 7.2 Exclus ion Criteria Individuals will be excluded from the pilot study participation if they: 1. Have a serious medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder that, in the opinion of the study physician, would make study participation hazardous to the participant, compromise study findings, or prevent the participant from completing the study. Examples Include : Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis or end -stage liver disease, acute hepatitis or moderate to severe renal impairment) as assessed by medical history, review of systems, physical exam, and/or laboratory assessments; current severe, untreated or inadequately treated mental health disorder (e.g., ac tive psychosis, uncontrolled manic -depressive illness) as assessed by mental health history and/or clinical interview; current severe benzodiazepine or other substance use requiring medical detoxification; suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring immediate attention. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 21 2. Have known allergy or hypersensitivity to buprenorphine, naloxone, or other components of the buprenorphine/naloxone formulation. 3. Have aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) liver enzymes greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal on screening phlebotomy performed within 60 days prior to the date of the Intake/Baseline Visit (Visit 1). 4. Have chronic pain requiring ongoing pain management with opioid analgesics. 5. Currently in jail, prison or any overnight fac ility as required by court of law or pending legal action that couldprevent participation in study activities (i.e., unable to complete 6 months of pharmacy -based OUD management). 6. Pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of screening. 7.3 Participant Re cruitment Study participants will be recruited from participating buprenorphine ambulatory, outpatient or primary care clinics, which will serve as study sites. These outpatient offices/clinics typically offer a broad array of on -site case management, soc ial work, and counseling support services to engage and retain OUD patients in care. Members of the OUD clinic care team will be informed about the pilot study and asked to refer potential participants who are interested in learning more about the study to clinic research staff for pre -screening. Specific recruitment procedures (e.g., local educational activities, community outreach, print and web - based advertisements, etc.) will vary by site accordingly to local needs and established procedures of bupreno rphine patient enrollment in research. Each Site Principal Investigator (PI) or Investigator will be a buprenorphine -waivered physician with a population of patients active in treatment sufficient to reach the recruitment goals. Each Site PI will work wit h at least one additional buprenorphine provider. We anticipate excellent cooperation between these providers in approaching potential participants and having the ability to function as backups for one another during the study period. If a potential study participant is interested in learning more about the study, a study staff member will meet with the participant to discuss the study. Potential participants will have initiated buprenorphine treatment (i.e., completed the induction pha se) and will be briefly instructed regarding the study. If the potential participant is interested in joining the study, the study staff member will commence the formal informed consent process. Potential participants will have to demonstrate an understand ing of the study requirements as part of the consent process prior to providing written informed consent. Strict ethical guidelines regarding professional conduct and confidentiality will be enforced for all study staff. Recruiting participants in clinic al settings poses many challenges to pre -screening and consenting potential participants, including the rapid pace of care, interruptions in clinical workflow, clinic productivity requirements, space limitations, and participants not feeling well enough to meet with research staff (Berkman et al., 2001; Falcon et al., 2011) . To minimize the impact of these challenges, research staff will spend considerable time interacting with clinical staff, familiarizing themselves with clinic patient flow, and learning how to communicate and negotiate with clinic staff regarding the nece ssary space and time to meet with potential study participants. Site Investigators will help facilitate negotiation of space and time requirements and serve as a resource to research staff regarding clinic procedures. Staff and sites with experience and expertise in buprenorphine treatment of OUD and conducting research studies in outpatient clinic settings will be prioritized for site selection. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 22 The study staff member conducting the Intake/Baseline Visit will negotiate the location of the visit as nece ssary to protect confidentiality and respect clinic patient flow. Each study site will be compensated for space use based on the number of study visits. If necessary, the potential participant will be given the option to participate in study screening and consent procedures in a nearby exam room or staff/patient lounge if it is unoccupied, or to reschedule the visit for another time. If a participant feels ill during the interview, research staff will stop and reschedule the visit. Although all attempts wil l be made to conduct the intake/baseline assessments over 1 or 2 visits, it is possible that they may be completed over multiple visits to the OBBT clinic, depending on the participant's schedule. 7.3.1 Special Populations to Consider This study may c onsent and enroll persons involved in the criminal justice system who are receiving OBBT for OUD and who will be available to complete 6 months of pharmacy -based OUD management. Parolees who are persons living in the community and sentenced to community -supervised monitoring may be consented and enrolled. Parolees who are detained in a treatment center as a condition of parole will NOT be consented and enrolled. Probationers (individuals wearing monitoring devices) may also be consented and enrolled, depend ing on their level of involvement with the criminal justice system. The study will not recruit persons incarcerated/detained in a correctional facility, persons who are pending trial, or persons who otherwise meet the definition of a prisoner as delineated in 45 CFR 46.303(c). However, the study will not exclude parolees and probationers if the persons will be available to complete 6 months of pharmacy -based OUD management. Those participants who become incarcerated or otherwise meet CFR -defined prisoner cr iteria during the course of their involvement with this study will be withdrawn from study participation. Research staff will assess each participant's prisoner status at each visit, prior to conducting any research -related procedures. If a participant bec omes incarcerated or otherwise meets the 45 CFR 46 definition of a prisoner, all applicable guidelines will be followed, including any required reporting to the IRB or other institution. 7.4 Number of Sites Approximately 3 -4 primary care, outpatient, or ambulatory clinics will serve as study sites, with two or more buprenorphine -waivered physicians per site. Each primary care, outpatient, or ambulatory clinic will be paired with a community pharmacy site, such that up to 3 -4 community pharmacy sites, w ith up to 3 pharmacists per site, will participate in the study. Each physician will supervise the activities in the study of one or more community pharmacists. 7.5 Site Characteristics Buprenorphine treatment clinics will be selected on the basis of the following characteristics: Provide buprenorphine treatment to OUD patients at a primary care, outpatient, or ambulatory care setting. Have a sufficient number of potential participants to achieve study recruitment goals (i.e., the OBBT clinic is expe cted to have the capability (e.g., structure, personnel) to treat at least 10 new patients per month). Have at least two buprenorphine -waived physicians in good standing with their State Medical Board and willing to stipulate an Operational Care Agreement and coach and supervise pharmacists in the use of buprenorphine for the management of OUD. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 23 Have prior experience in clinical data collection or have previously participated in research/clinical studies. Offer addiction counseling services as part of usual care on -site, or be able to refer participants to such services offered at an affiliated or nearby location (not required but encouraged). Have adequate and safe tele -communicati on tools (phone, fax, email) to share protected health information regarding participants with pharmacists. Pharmacy sites will be selected on the basis of the following characteristics: Have at least 2 years of experience with storing and dispensing cla ss II and III controlled substances. Have direct experience with dispensing buprenorphine treatment for OUD. Have Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certificate of Waiver to perform lab tests (or be willing to obtain the CLIA certificate of Waiver before the study initiation.) Have at least one pharmacist in good standing with their State Board and willing to stipulate an Operational Care Agreement and comply with training and study guidelines. Have available private areas (e.g., small roo m or office) to conduct visits with study participants. Have adequate and safe tele -communication tools (phone, fax, email) to share protected health information regarding participants with buprenorphine physician(s). We will develop and use the site inv entory/selection form (site survey) to collect this information from clinical and pharmacy sites in the geographical area identified for participation in the study. This form will briefly summarize the characteristics of the study and inquire on the charac teristics of the site required for participation as reported above. In the case of the community pharmacies, we will also ask about reasons for participation and non -participation in the trial during discussions with potential study sites (e.g., lack of ti me, plethora of/insufficient staff, willingness/unwillingness to deal with substance users, concerns with losing business, intent to increase clientele, fear of not being up to the task, desire to show competency in the matter, etc.). We will use organizat ional readiness questions (to be completed by physicians, pharmacists, and clinic/pharmacy staff or managers) to explore participating sites' barriers and/or facilitators to OUD treatment. 7.6 Rationale for Site Selection A pilot study is a requisite i nitial step in exploring a novel intervention or an innovative application of an existing intervention, which is often limited to testing the feasibility of the treatment at a single site (Leon et al., 2011). As the different components of treatment and th e environment in which the treatment is delivered are particularly important in this case, we intend to assess the feasibility and generalizability of this model at different sites, including academic and community clinics. Sites that have an adequate numb er of new buprenorphine treated participants per month will be selected for participation. Depending on the number of study physicians at a study site, we will need to enroll approximately 10-20 or more participants per site over 6 -7 months of recruitment in order to meet the recruitment goal. We will track the reasons for pre -screen failure and the ratio of participants who have signed the informed consent form among those who have undergone the prescreening process (i.e., have been a pproached for potential participation and have had the study described to them, and CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 24 were eligible on the pre -screen) to help project the expected recruitment in a subsequent multi - site full -scale study. 8.0 OUTCOME MEASURES 8.1 Primary Outcome Measur es As this is a feasibility study, there are several outcomes of interest, all of which are important to evaluating the potentiality of a full -scale RCT and informing the power calculations and design of this subsequent RCT. There will be no formal hypot hesis testing for these outcome measures, since only estimation is of interest. The primary outcome measures for this feasibility pilot study are: 1. Rate of recruitment of participants into trial The recruitment rate will be assessed on a monthly bas is until the enrollment target is reached. The recruitment rate is operationalized as the total number of participants consented in one month. The per -month proportion of consented participants reaching the the maintenance phase will also be calculated, as well as the per -month proportion of pre -screened participants that were consented. These rates will be used to estimate the speed at which a future multi -site RCT could consent, enroll, and randomize participants. Site -specific rates will also be computed to inform the design of the full - scale trial. 2. Retention in treatment Retention in treatment is defined as the proportion of scheduled visits completed (i.e., pharmacy OBBT maintenance phase visits) for Visit 2 through Visit 7. Not counting the Intake /Baseline Visit, the number of expected visits for all participants at the pharmacy is 6, based on 1 visit per month for the 6 months of the pharmacy OBBT maintenance phase. 3. Opioid and other substance use The prevalence of use of opioids/heroin, mea sured by the proportion of positive urine drug screens (UDS) at each visit and days of use of opioids/heroin as collected on Timeline Followback (TLFB) over the study duration will be examined. 4. Medication compliance Buprenorphine will be provided in the form of buprenorphine -naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone\u00ae). Medication compliance will be measured by film count/dose reconciliation at each visit (i.e., film count). The proportion of expected buprenorphine use in rel ation to actual use will be calculated at each visit. 8.2 Secondary Outcome Measures There are also several secondary outcome measures. These outcomes will also be used to help explore whether and how to proceed with a future full -scale study. The secondary outcome measures for this pilot study are: CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 25 1. Treatment fidelity Treatment fidelity will be defined by adherence of physician and pharmacist to the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist (Section 10.4) using the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form: proportion of visits showing 80% adherence or higher (Borrelli, 2011). 2. Satisfaction of participants, physicians and pharmacists with OUD care Satisfaction with treatment delivery by participants will be measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Survey (adapted from Harland et al. , 2005) at each visit. The proportion of visits in which participants are satisfied (score of 4 on a Likert Scale of 1 -5) or very satisfied (score of 5 on a Likert Scale of 1 -5) will be calculated. Pharmacist and physician satis faction with treatment delivery will be measured using the Treatment Satisfaction Survey on a monthly basis, and a proportion of physician and pharmacist monthly ratings of satisfied or very satisfied will be calculated. 3. Participant safety, as measured by: a) Any fatal or non -fatal substance -related overdose measured by self -report. b) Any substance -related ED visit or hospitalizationmeasured by self -report. 4. Pharmacist's use of the PDMP Pharmacist's use of the PDMP and communications with physician t o address PDMP reports, including measures of multiple buprenorphine prescriptions and other class II and III medication prescriptions, will be evaluated by self -report on the checklist at each visit. 8.3 Preliminary/exploratory Outcome Measures 1. Pharmacist's access to the EHR to capture and monitor treatment outcome measures Binary outcomes will be identified at each visit for measures from the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist, and their overlay with measures explored by the PDMP will be identified in a similar binary fashion. This outcome will only be assessed if EHR data are available. 2. Use of the EHR to compare treatment outcome measures A comparison of visit checklist outcomes may be performed between study participants and matched non -pharmacy treated patients, if EHR data are available. Depending on the access to the EHR, such EHR data will be collected by medical record abstraction. 9.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 9.1 Study Phases The pilot study will include 3 overlapping phases that are pro jected to take up to 16 -19 months and reflect the fact that participants will be consented and enrolled on a rolling basis. Table 2: Timeline of study phases Phase Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Location Pharmacy OBBT Clinic Pharmacy CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 26 Activity Pharmacist coaching, education Buprenorphine stabilization (pre-screening, consent, and screening) Buprenorphine maintenance Total Duration Up to 16 -24 weeks (3 -6 months) Up to 16 -20 weeks (6 -7 months) 24 weeks (6 months) per participant; up 13 months for all participants to complete 9.2 Screening and Baseline Procedures 9.2.1 Informed Consent Procedures (OBBT Clinic) During the pre -screening phase, potential participants may be identified among patients with OUD receiving OBBT at the study sites. Patients will be either self -referred or referred by providers or other sources in the community. Patients who have completed OBBT induction and show interest in the pilot study will be approached by research staff before completion of the stabilization phase, and have explained to them the study procedures and the potential risks and benefits of participating in the trial. Staff will be available to answer questions about the consent form while participants are reviewing it. After signing the consent form, participants will be provided with a copy of the signed form to keep for their records. The process may take approximately 30 minutes. All participants who sign the Informed Consent Form will be added to the Master Enrol lment Log. Following consent, participants will enter the screening phase of the study, which is comprised of the completion of screening and baseline assessments at Visit 1. Information regarding potential participants pre -screened and participants conse nted, as well as reasons for pre -screen and screen failure, will be collected. This information will be consolidated and developed into a web report. 9.2.2 HIPAA Authorization and Medical Record Release Form Study sites may be required by their instit utions and/or the single IRB of Record to obtain authorization from participants for use of protected health information. Sites and/or a Lead Node representative will be responsible for communicating with the institution(s), IRB(s) or Privacy Board(s) and obtaining the appropriate approvals or waivers to be in regulatory compliance. Participants will complete Medical Record Release Forms throughout the study (as applicable), including at the time of Informed Consent and/or intake/baseline, to grant permis sion to study staff to review inpatient, outpatient, mental health, and substance use treatment medical records as needed. 9.2.3 Intake and Baseline Assessment (OBBT Clinic) The data collected from the intake/baseline assessments will be primarily uti lized to determine each participant's eligibility for continuation to the maintenance phase of the study. After the prescreening and consent process is complete (i.e., participant has signed the informed consent form), study staff will prepare a new resear ch data record for the participant and administer the intake/baseline assessments. Because participants may be consented (i.e., sign the informed consent form) at any time during the stabilization visits, some participants may complete all intake and basel ine assessments on the same day, while others may complete these assessments over the course of multiple visits (conducted within a short period of time). All efforts will be made to CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 27 conduct the intake/baseline assessments over 1 or 2 visits; however, in r are cases it is possible that it will take more than 2 visits to complete these assessments, depending on the participant's schedule. The intake/baseline assessments will focus on collecting inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographics and other informat ion related to recruitment (e.g., locator form, pregnancy and birth control assessment for women of childbearing potential). The baseline assessments, detailed in Section 10.0, will capture the participant's clinical presentation and treatment history, as well as measures of efficacy and safety (see Study Assessment Timetable (Table 3) ). In total, the intake/baseline assessments will take approximately 45 -60 minutes to complete. Information on the reasons for screen failure (i.e., reasons the participant did not reach the maintenance phase) willl be collected and summarized in a web report. 9.2.4 Randomization This pilot study is not a randomized trial and thus will not utilize a randomization method. 9.3 Use of EHR Data The study team will obtain IRB approval to review and analyze available EHR data of matched non-study participants to collect biological and safety measures and for exploratory outcomes purposes, if the EHR data are available. Potential matching participan ts will be adults with OUD receiving buprenorphine treatment at the study sites who do not participate in this pilot study. They will be selected based on participant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants' key clinical information will be obtained from the EHR data and compared with some key information from the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist. Investigators will request a waiver of both HIPAA authorization and informed consent from the IRB of Record to use this de -identified information for the anal ysis. Further, the pharmacists' access to the EHR data will be explored by the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist. We expect some challenges regarding pharmacists' access to the EHR data; therefore, pharmacists' access to the EHR data are considered exploratory for the pilot study. Throughout the study and/or at the end of the study, research staff will obtain proper permission to review each participant's medical record to abstract relevant medical information from all study visits, including the Intake/Baseli ne Visit. The research staff will conduct the medical record review with the EHR or paper records located at the practice. If a practice is not adopting EHR, paper records will be used to collect biological test results and safety information. 9.4 Study Interventions 9.4.1 Overview of Study Interventions Typically, the initiation phase of OBBT begins with a low dose of buprenorphine and is followed by increasing doses over several days to minimize the likelihood of precipitating opioid withdrawal. After initiation, buprenorphine may be taken once or twice daily. Once a stable dose of buprenorphine is established, a therapeutic dose can be maintained over a stable period of time (SAMHSA, 2004; Kampman and Jarvis 2015). This study will assign a pharmacist to manage the buprenorphine maintenance phase of the treatment ( Figure 3 : Transitional Treatment Model and Roles ). In this pilot study model, the buprenorphine physician will be responsible for various aspects of patient treatment following induction, including: CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 28 conducting or reviewing patient assessments (including but not limited to drug testing), prescribing buprenorphine in accordance with Schedule III requirements, managing buprenorphine stabilization, record keeping that may be referenced for a DEA inspection, and providing clinical guidance, coaching, and supervision to each pharmacist, who is in turn managing a portion of buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Figure 3: Transitional Treatment Model and Roles The research staff will assist with the study data collection and facilitate the communication between physician and multiple pharmacists, as well as between providers and LIs. Co-LI (Mannelli) will serve as a coaching and research/clinical supervisor, as well as a treatme nt fidelity monitor. 9.4.2 Pharmacist Coaching Timeline and Procedures (see SOP for Pharmacist Coaching in the MOP) The training phase will be completed within 3 -6 months before the pilot clinical trial phase. This training phase will include pharmacist education and coaching regarding OBBT management, as well as study -specific protocol and assessment training. Pharmacist coaching for OBBT management will involve buprenorphine physicians, pharmacists, and Lead Investigators. Coaching model rationale: The approach that will be utilized in this study intends to provide standard, up -to-date knowledge that a physician who wants to be certified for buprenorphine would receive, including specific evaluations and passing grades. In addition, physicians and pha rmacists are educated on aspects of the study relevant to their intervention and interactions. physician coaching: pharmacist education and trai ning CONTENTS - Learning materials: - study SOPs, PCSSMAT modules - Buprenorphine waiver training - Visits and notes supervision physician: buprenorphine stabilization and supervision ROLE - Conducting or reviewing patient assessments, - Prescribing buprenorphine in accordance with Schedule III requirements, - Managing buprenorphine treatment, - Record keeping that may be referenced for a DEA inspection, - Providing clinical guidance, coaching, and direct supervision to the pharmacist, who is in turn managing a portion of buprenorphine maintenance treatment. - Assessing safety events pharmacist: maintenance visits ROLE - Medication reconciliation and patient education - Rating opioid withdrawal and craving - Collecting drug use self - report, toxicology samples - Monitoring PDMP - Medication dispensing - Monitoring compliance with psychosocial interventions - Monitoring comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, - Monitoring family, social, financial, and legal issues - Monitoring safety events CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 29 Coaching model overview: Coaching meetings : Each pharmacist will complete between 8 -10 coaching meetings (either in -person or web -based) with the supervising physician. Each meeting will be approximately 1 -2 hours in duration (at least 1 hour). Coaching participants : Study physicians will have an active part and engage study pharmacists in this coaching model. In order to complete the coaching phase and proce ed with the study, each pharmacist must pass the training tests where provided (i.e., based on the PCSS -MAT or equivalent materials) and participate in at least 80% (8 of 10) of the coaching sessions. Coaching and Study Materials : The Providers' Clinical Support System (PCSS) for Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) educational modules (encompassing 5 mandatory modules and 1 optional module) will be utilized throughout this study, including the following subjects: clinical evaluation of SUD, overdose, with drawal, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and -MAT, 2016). The following OBBT -related coaching materials are expected to be completed within 3 -6 months for all study pharmacists and physicians: SOP for the Operational Care Agreement, PCSS educational modules 1 -2, PCSS educational modules 3 -4, Educational module 5, Buprenorphine waiver training and decisional trees. In addition, physicians and pharmacists are required to participate in protocol -specific presentations and meetings (e.g., study design, materials, forms reviewing, study MOP). Each pharmacist will be individually evaluated for satisfactory training compl etion, and pharmacists who are not considered ready at the end of the training (as operationalized in the MOP) will be required to receive additional individual training before their participation in the study begins. 9.4.3 SOP for the Management of Pati ents Receiving Pharmacy -Based OUD Management (Operational Care Agreement) (see MOP) The SOP for the Operational Care Agreement will address: Visit components, biological testing: routine and extra testing, treatment monitoring and compliance (diagrams, f orms); Buprenorphine dose and dose changes criteria (associated decisional tree); Treatment plan; Special presentations; Management of no -show participants, overdose prevention, withdrawal management, psychiatric or medical emergencies; CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 30 Contacts with supervising physician, research staff, LIs; coaching as articulated in the treatment phase of the study. 9.4.4 Replicability of Training and Treatment Structure Intervention Fidelity (Evaluation of Treatment Integrity) and Quality Control Integrity Evaluation and Treatment Fidelity evaluation will measure the replicability of training. Elements of fidelity include a common training path for pharmacists and buprenorphine prescribing physicians, which offers standard knowledge, measurable treatment goals and results (e.g., passing scores). As structured, the training will be replicable and generate reproducible results. To address possible weaknesses of the training and treatment structure, the LIs will collect feedback from the physicians and pharmacists who participated in the pilot study at the end of the coaching phase and again after last study visit using the ad hoc Buprenorphine Education Feedback Questionnaire (see Section 10). This feedback will be used to improve the training phase and help to develop a 'curriculum' that will be utilized in a future randomized, multisite study. A progress note checklist (Buprenorphine Visit Checklist, Section 10) will be used by physicians and pharmacists so that treatment structure, fidelity, and r eplicability can be monitored. The use of the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist will facilitate supervision of treatment quality of the physicians' and pharmacists' care of patients. Quality control will also include LI supervision/resolution of clinical and r esearch queries. Supervision of Pharmacists The buprenorphine certified physician will supervise 1 or more pharmacist(s) during the buprenorphine maintenance phase. Supervision will be exerted as follows: (a) Confirm the daily dose of buprenorphine at the end of each visit via email, telephone, computer teleconference (e.g., Skype), or other type of telecommunications; (b) Conduct regular clinical review meetings, in person or via remote communication, regarding all open clinical cases. These meetings will oc cur monthly or more frequently if physician, pharmacist, or LIs deem it necessary; and (c) Communicate with the pharmacist regarding specific patients. At any time, pharmacist or physician may request a contact regarding a specific patient. A research staff member will facilitate interactions and keep track of reason, characteristics, and frequency of the communications. Approximately twenty percent (20%) of each pharmacist's progress notes, randomly selected, will be scored by the supervising physician usin g the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form (Complete, Incomplete, or N/A for each section of the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist). A score of Incomplete in any section will be discussed between the pharmacist and physician as part of the supervision activity, an d all discussions will be documented. If more than two Incomplete sections are identified per visit, this will determine a change of course and closer monitoring of visits/notes. If more than two insufficient visits (i.e., with more than 2 Incomplete secti ons) are identified per pharmacist, or by decision of LIs, additional training will be assigned. Supervision of Physicians and Pharmacists The Co -LI (Mannelli) has more than 25 years of clinical and research experience in the management of buprenorphine for OUD. For evaluation purposes, Co -LI (Mannelli) will randomly monitor pharmacist visits and score treatment fidelity based on scoring sheets, which will weigh CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 31 different aspects of treatment and therapeutic interaction. At least 1 visit will be performed per pharmacist, and the Co -LI will perform the supervision by using the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor Form (Section 10). The Co -LI will intervene in any unresolved issue between the physician and pharmacist when prompted by either physician or by a research staff member, particularly in cases of unanswered requests and low -scored or incomplete Buprenorphine Visit Checklists. The Co-LI will also participate in at least one regular clinical review meeting per physician/pharmacist. Tracking Implementation Prob lems and Readiness to Deliver Treatment We will collaborate with CTN DSC/CCC about the approach to track the problems encountered during the implementation of the study with feedback from physicians, pharmacists, participants, and help from a research sta ff member. We will discuss possible solutions and recommendations at regular project meetings and summarize them in the final study report. The resulting tracking list/document can be reported to the DSMB upon request. In addition, we will collaborate wit h CTN DSC/CCC to conduct two brief surveys of physicians and pharmacists, as well as staff/managers of participating sites, regarding organizational readiness in implementing MAT services (a first survey before the study initiation, a second survey after t he completion of the study). The content of the survey will be framed to understand barriers and facilitators of implementing MAT at their facilities (e.g., administrative support, staffing, training, and organizational processes in place). Participants of the organizational readiness survey will be compensated via a $25 gift card for completion of each survey ($50 total). 9.5 Buprenorphine Stabilization and Maintenance Visits 9.5.1 Buprenorphine Stabilization Visits (OBBT clinic visits with buprenorphine physician; up to 16 -20 weeks per participant) The stabilization phase has begun when a patient is experiencing no withdrawal symptoms, minimal or no side effects, and no longer has uncontrollable cravings for opioid agonists (SAMHSA, 2004; K ampman and Jarvis 2015). At this point, the physician should identify the lowest dose of buprenorphine at which the patient discontinues or markedly reduces the use of other opioids without experiencing withdrawal symptoms, significant side effects, or cra vings. Reduction and elimination of opioid/heroin use (via self -report and negative urine toxicology) represent the key target goals of this phase. Participants will enter into a maintenance phase of treatment when a stable dose of buprenorphine is achieve d and maintained for at least 3 weeks . During the stabilization phase, patients complete visits with the buprenorphine physician regularly (e.g., weekly, bi -weekly, or monthly), depending on their clinical status. A research staff member will be present at the OBBT clinic to help with research procedures and physicians' tasks as needed. Physicians will complete the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist, and the research staff member will help with other research -specific assessments and forms, including UDS and T LFB collection. Following the last stabilization visit or after the patient is considered clinically stablized, the participant will be referred to pharmacist care for maintenance visits. A stabilization visit will take approximately up to 1 hour to comp lete and will consist of the following elements: Stabilization Visit Elements: 1. Medication use and patient education. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 32 2. Opioid withdrawal using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) worksheet (Wesson and Ling, 2003) and opioid craving on a self -rated visual analogue scale of 0100 (McMillan and Gilmore -Thomas, 1996). 3. Collection of substance use via urine toxicology samples and self -report using the TLFB. 4. Monitoring the PDMP. 5. Medication management. 6. Compliance with psychosocial interventions via the Psychosocial Counseling Attendance form. 7. Concomitant medications assessment. 8. Psychiatric and medical problems, family, social, financial, and legal issues, using a modified version of the Problem List Form (NIDA, 1998). 9. Safety events. 10. Suicidali ty risk evaluation. 11. Treatment plan evaluation (including medication dose adjustments, as needed). Data for the following components may be abstracted from the medical record, if available, if they occured during the current treatment episode's stabilization phase: 1. Physical exam, up to 6 months prior to consent. 2. Vital sign assessment, up to 1 month prior to consent. 3. Monitoring of the PDMP, up to 1 week prior to consent. 4. Treatment plan, up to 1 month prior to consent. 9.5.2 Buprenorphine Maintenance Visits (Participant visits with pharmacist; 24 weeks per participant) When a stable buprenorphine dose is achieved (i.e., the same dose of buprenorphine is maintained for at least 3 weeks), pati ents enter into the maintenance phase of treatment. In accordance with clinical practice, maintenance visits will occur with the pharmacist at the pharmacy location at least monthly, and study -specific data will be collected at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Visits may also be conducted at shorter intervals, depending on participants' clinical stability. If a participant relapses or destabilizes, he or she should be monitored more frequently. During the maintenance phase, less direct medication dose manage ment and increased monitoring of problematic behavioral areas are usually needed (HRSA, 2016). In the management of buprenorphine maintenance, the pharmacist will be required to implement and expand a patient centered care approach already implemented in collaboration with other members of the health care team to optimize medication outcomes in the treatment of other medical conditions (CPNP, 2016). This process includes the following evidence -based practices: collect and assess subjective and objective in formation about the patient to develop and implement an individualized plan, monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the care plan, and CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 33 modify the plan under supervision of physician and in collaboration with patient as needed (JCPP, 2014; ASHP, 2014). Each maintenance visit will take approximately 30 -45 minutes to complete and will consist of the following elements: Maintenance Visit Elements: 1. Film count/dose reconciliation and patient education. 2. Opioid withdrawal using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawa l Scale (COWS) worksheet and opioid craving on a self -rated visual analogue scale of 0 -100. 3. Collection of substance use via urine toxicology samples and self -report using the TLFB. 4. Monitoring the PDMP. 5. Compliance with psychosocial interventions via the Psychosocial Counseling Attendance form. 6. Concomitant medications assessment. 7. Psychiatric and medical problems, family, social, financial, and legal issues, using a modified version of the Problem List Form. 8. Safety events. 9. Suicidality risk evalu ation. 10. Monitoring the EHR (optional: depending on the access to the EHR). 11. Treatment plan evaluation by physician (including medication dose adjustments, as needed). 12. Dispensing medication following the prescription of supervising physician. A research staff member will be present at the pharmacy to help with research procedures and pharmacists' tasks as needed. Pharmacists will complete the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist, and the research staff member will help with other research -specific assessments a nd forms, including UDS and TLFB collection ( Table 3 ). The pharmacist and supervising physician will sign the Operational Care Agreement. As specified in the MOP, scheduling of an earlier follow up visit (2 -3 weeks) may be prompted by: poor compliance wit h medication, study visits, or counseling attendance, or worsening of opioid use (higher number of days of use than the previous month or positive toxicology following a negative sample). The results of evaluations will be discussed after the visit with t he supervising physician who will release buprenorphine prescription contingent on the evaluation results, and the date of the next appointment will be confirmed with the patient. At the end of the 24 -week pharmacist management period, the patient will ret urn to the buprenorphine physician's care. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 34 9.5.3 Early Termination Visit (at pharmacy) This visit will be completed at the pharmacy site for participants who discontinue study participation early (including those who stop buprenorphine treatment premat urely). Baseline clinical and safety measures will be repeated as detailed in Section 10. 9.5.4 Counseling -Psychosocial Intervention As mandated by guidelines, all providers must have the ability to refer buprenorphine -treated patients to behavioral treatment (SAMHSA, 2004). Despite these regulations, the optimal content of this behavioral treatment remains unknown for this patient population. To date, studies have not provided enough evidence to demonstrate a significan t benefit of any one form of psychosocial intervention (such as the addition of a specific type of counseling or self -help group attendance to buprenorphine treatment), and different forms of behavioral treatment can coexist (Copenhaver et al., 2007; Dugos h et al., 2016). Thus, no specific counseling model will be suggested to participants. Counseling is not delivered as part of the study interventions and is conducted separately from the physician or pharmacist -managed buprenorphine visits, but the occurre nce of the event at the study site or other site will be recorded at each visit. At the beginning of treatment, it is recommended that participants attend psychosocial counseling at least once per week. As treatment progresses, counseling frequency will be individualized based on each participant's characteristics and needs, and may lessen in frequency over time. Each participant's compliance with the psychosocial intervention will be assessed by the Psychosocial Counseling Attendance Form at each visit. The case report form will assess whether the participant's counseling attendance matches what is recommended in the treatment plan. This will be accomplished by participants' self -reports and may be confirmed by contacting or calling the participant's desi gnated family member/significant other (Psychosocial Counseling Attendance Form, Section 10). 9.5.5 Other Medications and Concurrent Treatments This study will not restrict the use of concomitant prescribed medications, with the exception of opioids. Concurrent medical and psychiatric treatments will be under direct control of the prescribing physician and will be assessed at each scheduled visit for their potential to interact with buprenorphine. Concurrent treatments wi ll be recorded using the Concomitant Medications form and Non -Drug Therapy Log. 9.5.6 Handling of Missed Visits and Substance Use Given that opioid agonist substitution therapy primarily targets illicit opioid use, and that complete and continuous ab stinence from substances requires some time to be achieved, it is possible that opioid or other substance use may present a significant safety concern in the management of participants receiving the buprenorphine therapy. If the participant misses a sche duled visit, no additional buprenorphine prescription will be given, and one alternative visit will be scheduled as a make -up visit. If opioid use is reported or suspected at any time during treatment, the participant will be contacted to perform at leas t one random urine drug use test prior to the next scheduled visit if the treating physician deems it appropriate. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 35 If the participant misses three consecutive visits (e.g., the first monthly visit, the following early substitution visit, and the second m onthly visit), he/she will be discontinued from study and contacted by pharmacist/research staff to complete the Early Termination Visit and be referred back to the buprenorphine physician. The same provision will be adopted when as many as six visits in total need to be rescheduled, or in the case of three consecutive or five non -consecutive positive opioid/heroin urine drug tests. Any non -prescribed use of benzodiazepines that is detected will prompt analogue measures to those adopted for opioid use. The abuse of other substances or alcohol is strongly discouraged as part of the treatment plan and will be discussed with the participant, reviewed with the supervising physician and Co -LI (Mannelli) if needed, and reported in the visit progress note. Missed visits will be documented using the Missed Visit CRF . Under the consideration of Lead Investigator(s), phone interviews may be used to collect study assessments for missed visits. 9.6 Participant Discontinuation All participants will be followed for the duration of the study (24 weeks for pharmacy OUD maintenance) unless they withdraw consent, stop the study medication, die, or the investigator or sponsor decides to discontinue their enrollment for any reason. In addition to what is described in Section 9.5.6 (discontinuation based on missed visits and/or illicit substance use), reasons for the investigator or sponsor to terminate a participant from the study may include, but are not limited to: study participation becoming unsafe, the participant becoming a threat to self or others, lack of funding, or DSMB early termination of the study for safety reasons. Of note, participants who discontinue study medication for any reason will be discontinued from the study. If a participant is discontinued from the study, an Early Termination Visit and End of Medication form should be completed as soon as possible following participant discontinuation to assess the participant's safety. 9.7 Blinding This study will not util ize a blinding method. 9.8 Participant Reimbursement Participants will be compensated for their time and transportation to study visits. Participants will be paid $50 for the Intake/Baseline Visit (i.e., for completing assessments for this visit) and $ 50 for the last study visit (either Visit 7 or the Early Termination Visit). Participants will be paid $40 for attending each of the other visits (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). If the participant completes all study visits, total reimbursement will be $300. No reimbursement will be provided for extra visits. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 36 10.0 STUDY ASSESSMENTS The primary focus of the pilot clinical trial is to explore and assess needs and capability to support CTN's new efforts in engaging pharmacists and connecting pharmacists with pri mary care and ambulatory providers (e.g., team -based coordinated care model) in OUD -related intervention trials. Study assessments will focus on the feasibility (e.g., recruitment, implementation of the intervention), OUD treatment outcomes, and safety mea sures.

Inclusion/Exclusion Checklist This form will include each inclusion and exclusion criterion to document eligibility. Eligibility will be assessed continually, as appropria te. Only participants who continue to meet study eligibility criteria will be allowed to continue with the screening process and study intervention. Locator Form A locator form is used to obtain information to assist in finding participants during treat ment and at follow -up. The information on this form will also be used to contact participants to remind them of upcoming study visits. This form collects the current address, email address, and phone numbers of the participant AND one or more family member s/significant other, friends, or counselors designed by the participant to provide participant's attendance of psychosocial interventions. In order to facilitate locating participants if direct contact efforts are unsuccessful, addresses, email adresses an d phone numbers of at least one other person (e.g., family members, significant others, friends) who may know how to reach the participant are collected, as well as information such as social security number, driver's license number and other information t o aid in searches of public records. This information will be collected at screening, and will be updated at each visit as needed. No information from this form is used in data analyses nor is this information captured in the data capture system. Demograp hics The Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org) includes recommended measures that are being adopted across NIDA -funded research (NIDA, 2012). The Demographics form will collect information about demogr aphic characteristics of the participant, including sex, date of birth, ethnicity, race, education, employment pattern, and marital status. Treatment Satisfaction Survey Participants, pharmacists and buprenorphine physicians will be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the quality of the treatment (modified from Harland et al., 2015). Participant satisfaction with treatment will be recorded on the Treatment Satisfaction Survey (based on a 5point Likert scale: 0 = very dissatisfied, to 5 = very s atisfied) that is completed by study participants at each study visit (1 -7), including the Early Termination Visit (if participant discontinues study participation early). Pharmacists and physicians will also be asked to complete the Treatment Satisfaction Survey once per month, beginning the month of the first participant, first visit (FPFV; Visit 1) at their paired site and ending the month of the last participant, last visit (LPLV) at their paired site. End of Medication Form This form tracks the part icipant's status with regard to the study intervention/medication. It will be completed at the pharmacy at the Early Termination Visit (if the participant discontinues study participation early), or at Visit 7 (for participants who complete study participa tion). Phone interviews may be used to collect study assessments for participants who discontinue study participation early and are unable to return for Early Termination Visit during the specified time period. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 44 Study Completion This form tracks the participant's status in the study. It will be completed at Visit 7 (for participants who complete the study) or at the Early Termination Visit (for participants who discontinue study participation early). For participants who do not complete a final visit, the Study Completion form will be completed once the Visit 7 visit window elapses. This form will be used in data analyses to address va riables such as treatment retention and completion. Protocol Deviations Protocol Deviations will be assessed and documented throughout the study. 10.3 Research Tasks: Clinical Assessments DSM -5 Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Checklist The DSM -5 OUD Checklist is a semi -structured, interviewer -administered instrument that provides past -year diagnosis for opioid use disorder based on DSM -5 diagnostic criteria (APA, 2013; Forman et al ., 2004). The DSM -5 OUD Checklist will be completed at screening to determine eligibility. Urine Drug Screen (UDS) Urine drug screens will be collected at Intake/Baseline, at Visits 2 through 7, and/or as needed, based on clinical decision. If the participant discontinues study participation early, UDS will be collected at the Early Termination Visit. However, should the study participant have a medical condition (e.g., being on a catheter) that prevents or affects the proper collection of UDS and its temperature testing, UDS and its temperature testing may not be needed to define the validity of the test. For example, the catheter urine does not have to be subject to temperature testing. All urine specimens will be collected using FDA -approved one -step temperature -controlled urine drug test cups and all of the manufactu rer's recommended procedures will be followed. The commercially available UDS system (Rapid Dip Drug Test,Opiate 2000 ng single strip, and BUP 10 ng single strip) will test for the presence of the The phencyclidine results will not be entered into the data system or used for data analysis. UDS tests are temperature controlled to avoid tampering, and a further validity check is performed using a commercially available adulterant test strip. In the event that urine specimen tampering is suspected, either based on observation or adulterant test results, study staff should request a s econd urine sample and may observe the urine collection process according to clinic standard operating procedures. Urine is recognized as the prime matrix for drug test screening with well -established methods and testing protocols (Allen, 2011). Compared to oral fluid testing, urine drug screening is more sensitive, less expensive, and can detect drug use for several days prior to the date of testing, whereas oral fluid cannot (Allen, 2011). The presence of drug in saliva has been insufficiently tested to be able to offer reliable and scientifically reproducible results; further, the lack of concordance studies examining both urine and oral fluid drug levels and kinetics in the clinical setting is of some concern (Allen, 2011). In addition, instant saliva t ests have produced inconsistent results compared with laboratory evaluation (Yacoubian and Wish, 2006), and cannot be reliably used for the purpose of evaluating and adjusting buprenorphine treatment based on the drug testing during the clinical visit. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 45 In this study, urine drug screening results demonstrating ongoing opioid use or other substance use (e.g., cocaine) will be managed in a non -punitive manner. Results demonstrating opioidnegative tests will receive positive reinforcement. Unexpected uri ne drug screen results provide opportunities for counseling and brief intervention. Timeline Followback (TLFB) The Timeline Followback (TLFB), an instrument with high test -retest reliability and validity for the assessment of self -reported substance an d alcohol use over a 30 -day look -back period (Sobell and Sobell, 1992; Sobell and Sobell, 2000), will be utilized in this study. Participants will be asked to report daily substance and alcohol use since the previous TLFB assessment at the Intake/Baseline Visit and Visits 2 through 7. If the participant discontinues study participation early, TLFB will be collected at the Early Termination Visit. Substance Abuse and Addiction: PhenX Core Tier 1 -2 The PhenX Toolkit provides researchers with well -establish ed and low -burden measures suitable for human subject research (NIDA, 2012; Pan et al., 2012). We will use the measures from the Substance Abuse and Addiction PhenX Core Tier 1 to collect information regarding substance use including age of onset, past 30 -day quantity and frequency, lifetime use for alcohol, tobacco and other substances; quality of life; and HIV Risk and Status. We will also assess annual family income. The assessments will be completed at Intake/Baseline. The \"Quality of Life\" and \"Tobacco Use History\" measures will be also be repeated at visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (or the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early). Medical and Psychiatric History and Status - Medical History (MHX), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9), P4 Screener MHX, PHQ -9, and P4S case report forms will assess information about medical and psychiatric history, as well as past and present health conditions, to help determine eligibility an d to provide baseline information. The MHX gathers medical and behavioral history exploring current symptoms, including psychiatric treatments and medications, and will be collected during screening only. The PHQ -9 (Spitzer et al. , 1999), a validated, se lf-administered version of the PRIME -MD, contains the mood (PHQ -9) module as covered in the original PRIME -MD. It will be administered at Intake/Baseline and repeated at the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early. Endorsements of suicidality on the PHQ -9 (i.e., if the participant answers Q9 (\"Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way\") as \"Several days\", \"More than half the days\" or \"Nearly every day\") will be addressed locally at each site and will trigger the completion of the Suicidal Risk form. The P4 Screener (Dube et al., 2010) is a brief measure (approximately 5 minutes used for assessing potential suicide risk in primary care. The participant will answer 4 questions rega rding past attempts, a plan, probability of completing suicide, and preventive factors at screening to exclude active suicidal ideation at Intake/Baseline. If the participant answers \"Yes\" to Question 2 of this screener, \"Have you thought about how you mig ht actually hurt yourself?\", study staff will ask the participant additional clarifying questions to assess suicidality. During treatment Visits 27, any suicidal ideation investigated and/or reported in the psychological problem section of the Problem List (see below) will prompt the administration of the P4S. If the participant discontinues study participation early, the P4S Screener will be completed at the Early Termination Visit. The completion of the Suicidal Risk form requires direct evaluation of the participant for suicide risk CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 46 by qualified healthcare individual(s) according to the site's specific SOPs or existing procedures or policy at the site to address such risk. This evaluation will take place immediately following the outcome analysis of the r esults and prior to the participant leaving the study site. Medical or psychiatric history information collected before study participation may be used with the participant's permission. Information from this form may be used in data analyses. Physical E xam The study clinician will complete a physical examination and review of systems at screening to ensure that there are no medical concerns regarding participation and to gather baseline information regarding the participant's physical health. Alternati vely, physical exam data may be abstracted from medical records, when available, if conducted within 6 months prior to the date of informed consent. Research staff will record the information on the case report form. Vital Signs Study personnel will col lect vital signs information (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, height, and weight) at screening to inform overall medical fitness for participation (in combination with data from the physical exam). Alternatively, vital sign data may be abstracted from medical records, when available, if conducted within 1 month prior to the date of informed consent. Problem List This form has been in use at community treatment programs (NIDA, 1998) and explores 7 problematic areas in open -ended fashion, including Dru gs/Alcohol, Employment/Support, Family, Recreational/Social Psychological, Legal, and Medical. It will be used at the Intake/Baseline Visit and at Visits 2 through 7 (or the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early) . Initially, information regarding the previous year will be collected, then changes from the previous visit will be recorded. Concomitant Medications & Non -Drug Therapy Log Concomitant medications will be collected on the Concomitant Medications form at the Intake/Baseline Visit (Visit 1). Concomitant medications will be reviewed at every subsequent study visit (including Visit 7 or the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early), and changes will be documented on t he Buprenorphine Visit Checklist. If at any point it is indicated that the participant has a need for ongoing opioid analgesic treatment, he or she will be excluded/withdrawn in accordance with study eligibility criteria. Non -drug therapies will be assesse d and documented at Intake/Baseline and at each study visit after that, including Visit 7 (or the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early). The study medical clinician may also exclude any participant taking medica tions or receiving non -drug therapies that could interact adversely with the study drug at his/her clinical discretion. 10.4 Clinical Tasks Buprenorphine Visit Checklist The purpose of this document is to provide the buprenorphine prescribing physician with a clinical instrument for coaching, supervising, and monitoring the activities of pharmacists while the pharmacists are involved with patient evaluation and buprenorphi ne treatment dispensing. In order to fully understand and utilize the checklist, physicians will be asked to become familiar with the instrument and its application. Both the buprenorphine prescribing physician (during the stabilization phase) and the phar macist (during the maintenance phase) will be asked to adopt the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist and follow a consistent grid of interventions, including the main CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 47 evaluation and management actions listed in Section 9.5. The results of this effort will be cap tured for the Intake/Baseline Visit 1/1B and subsequent Visits 2 through 7 (or Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early). Different aspects of treatment compliance, fidelity and replicability are associated with and justify the use of this checklist. Visual Analog Craving Scale (VAS) Participants' craving for opioids will be documented on a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranges from 0 (no craving) to 100 (most intense craving possible) (McMillan, Gilmore -Thomas, 1 996). Participants will be specifically instructed to indicate the overall intensity of craving experienced. This scale will be completed at the following visits: Intake/Baseline and Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. If the participant discontinues study partic ipation early, the scale will be completed at the Early Termination Visit. Results from this scale are part of the clinical information the physician will receive and utilize to adjust the buprenorphine treatment as outlined in the study protocol. Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) The presence of withdrawal discomfort will be documented using the COWS (Wesson and Ling, 2003), an 11 -item, interviewer -administered questionnaire designed to provide a description of directly observed signs and sy mptoms of opiate withdrawal (e.g., sweating, runny nose). This scale will be completed at each visit (i.e., Intake/Baseline and Visits 2 through 7). If the participant discontinues study participation early, this scale will be completed at the Early Termin ation Visit. Results from this scale are part of the clinical information the physician will receive and utilize to adjust the buprenorphine treatment as outlined in the study protocol. 10.5 Research Tasks: Safety Assessments Laboratory tests Trained s taff will be responsible for collecting and processing biologic specimens. Local laboratories at participating sites will be used to conduct laboratory tests. Laboratories must participate in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1998 (CLIA) (or provi de equivalent evidence of laboratory certification). Laboratories will provide reference ranges and proof of laboratory certification prior to study initiation and as needed throughout the study. Safety labs : Liver function tests (LFTs, consisting of AST and ALT) will be performed to help determine eligibility at screening. Receipt and review of laboratory test results is necessary before confirming eligibility and beginning the study intervention. Results of laboratory tests conducted within 60 days prio r to the Intake/Baseline Visit (Visit 1) (e.g., collected as part of routine care before the induction admission) will be acceptable. Throughout the study, LFTs may be collected as needed for participant safety, per the discretion of the study physician. Pregnancy and Birth Control Assessment This form will document the administration of pregnancy tests, test results, childbearing potential, and female participants' self -reports of an acceptable method of birth control. The Pregnancy and Birth Control A ssessment, will be collected during screening (Visit 1) to determine eligibility, as well as at Visits 2 through 7. For females of childbearing potential : a blood pregnancy test will be performed at Visit 1 (or up to 7 days prior to Visit 1B) to confirm participant eligibility. A confirmatory urine pregnancy test will also be completed at the pharmacy following Visit 1, immediately before the participant is dispensed the first dose of study medication. Following initiation of the study intervention. subse quent urine pregnancy tests will be performed at Visits 2 through 7 and as needed CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 48 throughout the study. If the participant discontinues study participation early, the birth control assessment and urine pregnancy test will be completed at the Early Terminat ion Visit. A positive pregnancy test following initiation of the study intervention will result in the cessation of study medication and a referral back to the buprenorphine physician. The site staff will follow the participant until an outcome of the pr egnancy is known and reported. Safety Events As buprenorphine is an approved drug being prescribed in accordance with the approved usage, there would be no need to capture AEs per se, as the likely AEs are already known. However, in terms of compliance, informing dosing, side effects or monitoring those aspects, a solicited collection of information is relevant. To aid the collection of safety events, a tool in the form of a Safety Event Response Checklist [SERC -75] with solicited symptom information, yes /no responses, and level of severity (mild, moderate, severe) will be developed for addition to the MOP. The checklist will be used by research staff to obtain self -reported information from each participant at the monthly pharmacist visit, which will then be captured electronically in the database. The MOP will specify the process of reporting safety events that may require interventions (such as dosing, side effects, etc.) to participants' physicians and pharmacists, as well as to the Lead Investigators. In this way, open -ended questions that are left up to the determination of the Pharmacists/research staff are avoided and staff members remain within their scope by eliminating the expectation that they will be assessing physical symptoms of a participant. The completion of the checklist will be documented in the progress note for each visit so that the physician is able to review along with the other information provided by the pharmacist from the visit prior to writing the participant's prescription. For the purposes of this protocol, the following safety events will be collected and reported to inform dosing as well as assist with monitoring of medication compliance: possible side effects of the medication: headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, insom nia, excessive sweating, increased sensitivity in the mouth, burning sensation in the mouth, sores in the mouth, pain, swelling, and overdoses. In addition, we will collect all ER visits, hospitalizations, and death of any participant who provided written informed consent. Following informed consent, the protocol -specified safety events will be solicited and recorded at each study visit (including the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early), according to the outl ined procedures. If a reportable safety event suggests medical or psychological deterioration, it will be brought to the attention of the study clinician for further evaluation. The safety event will be medically managed, reported, and followed in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. The participant may need to return to the clinician's office for extra visits in order to adequately manage an identified safety event. Hospitalizations Hospitalization for any medical and/or psychiatric reaso n will be reported accordingly on the Safety Event Response Checklist [SERC -75]. All hospitalizations will be assessed by self -report at visits 1 through 7 (or Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early). Overdoses Non-fatal overdoses since the last visit will be captured via self -report using the Safety Event Response Checklist at each visit following consent (including the Intake/Baseline Visit) through Visit 7 (or the Early Termination Visit if the participant dis continues study participation early). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 49 Overdose events are sentinel events that are less likely to be prone to recall bias than other events. Data on fatal overdoses may be collected via medical chart record review, if EHR data is available, at Visit 7 (o r the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early). This will be supplemented with information from contact with persons listed on the participant's locator form when participants are lost to follow -up throughout the s tudy. Fatal overdoses will be captured on the Safety Event Response Checklist [SERC -75]. Death All deaths, regardless of cause, will be captured for this study. These events will be identified through the participants' locator information, or when possi ble through state medical examiner records, National Death Index, and/or review of medical records. Deaths will be reported using the Safety Event Response Checklist [SERC -75]. 10.6 Research Tasks: Treatment Compliance and Feasibility Recruitment Log Drawing on the information captured in the Master Enrollment Log, as well as by reviewing the signed consent forms, the Recruitment Log will collect data on the number of potential participants who have been pre -screened for participation in the study and t he number of participants who signed the informed consent form. This data will be used monthly to calculate the recruitment rates for each study site during the 6 -7 month enrollment phase. Data from this log will be used to project the number of participan ts and inform the duration of enrollment (i.e., recruitment rate) for a future multi -site clinical trial. Coaching Training Completion (Pharmacists) This form will capture the successful completion of training by each single pharmacist and will be comple ted by the end of the coaching phase. Pharmacists will not be able to see study participants unless they have participated in the expected training and have passed the tests as required. Buprenorphine Visit Monitor Form The Buprenorphine Visit Monitor Fo rm adopts a Complete, Incomplete, or N/A scoring system for each section of the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist. A specific task is defined in each section of the checklist: Complete will be defined a completed task, Incomplete will be assigned if the task w as not completed or was missing, and N/A defines tasks that are Not Applicable. An Incomplete score in any section will be discussed between the pharmacist and physician as part of the supervision activity. If more than two Incomplete sections are identifi ed per visit, this will determine a change of course and closer monitoring of visits/notes. If more than two insufficient visits (i.e., with more than 2 Incomplete sections) are identified per pharmacist, or by decision of the LIs, additional training will be assigned. Pharmacist monitoring by physician will be performed during the maintenance phase. Twenty percent (20%) of each pharmacist's progress notes (i.e., the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist), randomly selected, will be scored by the supervising physic ian using the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form. Further, random monitoring by the Co -LI (Mannelli) of physician, pharmacist and pharmacist -physician interaction will be performed at each site using the Buprenorphine Visit Monitor form. One or more visits p er physician and pharmacist respectively will be monitored in this fashion. The Co -LI will also participate in at least one regular clinical review meeting per physician/pharmacist. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 50 Buprenorphine Education Feedback Questionnaire We will collect the opini ons of pharmacists and buprenorphine physicians about the clarity and utility of the coaching materials, as well as any lack of useful information from the training. The questionnaire will consist of specific questions on each training module to be rated o n a 5 -point Likert Scale of satisfaction, and will be filled out at the end of the coaching phase and once all participants at each site complete Visit 7 (or the Early Termination Visit, if not Visit 7). The results will be used to structure the coaching e ducation material for a subsequent multi -site clinical trial. Psychosocial Counseling Attendance Form Participants' psychosocial counseling attendance will be assessed at each visit (Intake/Baseline Visit and maintenance Visits 2 through 7 (or the Early Termination Visit if the participant discontinues study participation early)). It serves the purpose of monitoring and reporting whether counseling attendance matches what is recommended in the treatment plan at each visit. This will be accomplished throug h participants' self reports, which may be confirmed by communication with the participant's counselor/therapist or family/significant other. The physician or pharmacist will also assess the participant's attendance of self -help group or other counseling e ncounters by confirming with their sponsor/significant other. This information will be documented on the Psychosocial Counseling Attendance Form and summarized on the Buprenorphine Visit Checklist. Process Measures The pilot study seeks to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of having pharmacists administer office -based buprenorphine therapy under the supervision of buprenorphine physicians and improve safe access to evidence -based treatment. Patient and physician or pharmacist attitudes, assessed in the pilot study, influence and ultimately determine adoption of new treatment modalities (Rieckmann, Daley et al ., 2007). The patient, physician or pharmacist, and organizational attitudes are key inputs to adoption of new evidence -based approaches in healthcare settings (Damschrodern et al., 2009). In the case of this pilot study, the quality of transfer of the OBBT treatment to a pharmacy environment is crucial and will be adopted as a process measure. Further, we will collaborate with CTN DSC/CCC to conduct two brief surveys of physicians and pharmacists, as well as staff/managers, of participating sites regarding organizational readiness in implementing MAT services (a first survey before the study initiation, a second survey after the completion of the study). Prior to agreeing to complete the survey, survey participants will be asked to read an IRB -approved information sheet that outlines the purpose of the survey and the procedures involved. Survey participants who proceed with the survey after rea ding the information sheet are considered to have provided informed consent for the survey. The content of the survey will be framed to understand barriers and facilitators of implementing MAT at their facilities (e.g., administrative support, staffing, tr aining, and organizational processes in place). Participants of the Organizational Readiness Survey will be compensated $25 for completion of each survey ($50 total). The pilot study will assess treatment satisfaction using the Treatment Satisfaction Survey (1 -5). Comparing treatment satisfaction between participants, pharmacists and physicians will inform the link between treatment process and outcomes. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 51 11.0 STUDY T REATMENTS 11.1 Study Medication 11.1.1 Study Medication Management Each research site, including pharmacies, is required to observe local, state, and federal regulations regarding receipt, custody, dispensing, and disposition of all study medications. Each site will maintain an adequate supply of unexpired study medicatio ns on site. Upon receipt of the study medication, the investigator, pharmacist, or authorized designee at each site is responsible for taking inventory of the study drug. A record of this inventory must be kept and usage must be documented. Any unused or expired study drug shall be accounted for. During the stabilization phase, buprenorphine prescribing clinicians are instructed to provide the study medication as follows: Give total daily dose administered on the previous day. Add an additional 2 to 4 mg as needed (up to 16 mg) based on severity of withdrawal symptoms (e.g., add 2 mg for mild withdrawal or 4 mg for moderate -severe withdrawal as rated by COWS). Criteria for dose increase: Increased opioid craving or withdrawal since last observation. Target Dose will be the dose that results in the optimal relief of objective and subjective opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The expected dose is 16 mg daily, though lower doses such as 8 mg per day may be sufficient and higher doses such as 24 mg may be required. Maximum suggested daily dose is 24 mg (HRSA, 2016). During the maintenance phase, dose is maintained stable unless recent opioid use and/or increased withdrawal and craving from previous visit suggest adjustment by the study physician. 11.1. 2 Medication (Drug) Accountability Records Appropriately qualified and trained study personnel will maintain accurate and current accounting of all study medication by utilizing drug accountability records which are made available for review by study mon itors and other appropriate research personnel. Accurate drug accountability records: Demonstrate that the study drug was dispensed according to standard clinical practice; Document receipt of the study medication, date, lot #, expiration date, quantity and dosage; Account for unopened, un -dispensed, unused, returned, wasted or broken medication; Dosing logs should record participant ID #, date dispensed, drug name, lot # a nd amount dispensed; Temperature logs should show a daily record of medication storage temperature. 11.1.3 Dispensing of Study Medication All study medications shall be prepared and dispensed by a pharmacist or licensed medical practitioner appropriat ely trained and authorized to dispense study medications per local regulations. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 52 11.1.4 Study Medication Storage The medication will be stored at the pharmacy where maintenance visits are conducted at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), with excursions permitted between 15-30\u00b0C (59 -86\u00b0F). Study medication will be stored in compliance with the Package Insert and all federal, state, and local laws and institutional policy, including the regulations observed with other class III medications dispensed at the pharmacy. Study m edication is stored in a secured location, separate from any commercial stock, under the conditions specified by the package insert. 11.1.5 Used/Unused Medication Study medication returned by a participant may not be re -issued for use. Unused study me dication is returned and logged into a perpetual inventory of study medication returned. Damaged, returned, expired or unused study medication is accounted for by the NIDA contract monitor and sent to the central distributor or a reverse distributor for de struction. 11.1.6 Lost Medication No replacement of study medications is permitted. Exceptions may be made on a case -by-case basis at the request of the site study physician with LI(s) agreement and will be considered a study deviation. 11.1.7 Medication Packaging Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film will be provided at no cost for participants after enrollment and supplied individually for both the 4mg and 8mg films. Each package has the study drug information. Lot number, medication expir ation date, and storage conditions, as well as manufacturer and distributor information, will be included on the kit labels as supplied by the manufacturer. 11.1.8 Provisions for Access to Treatment after Study Prior to the conclusion of the 24 -week t reatment phase, the research team will make efforts to arrange for continued treatment with buprenorphine as locally appropriate. In most cases, participants will be returned to the care of referring study physician who will continue to prescribe buprenorp hine. Where this is not possible (due to insurance or availability of treatment resources, etc.), alternative treatment referrals (e.g., other buprenorphine physicians, methadone maintenance, intensive outpatient psychosocial aftercare) will be made as app ropriate. 12.0 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 12.1 General Considerations Past research has demonstrated that the metabolism of buprenorphine is mediated by the cytochrome P450 pathway, as it inhibits the activity of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (Picard et al., 2005). Further, in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes have demonstrated that the major metabolite of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, moderately inhibits the activity of CYP2D6 (Picard et al ., 2005). Despite these findings, the relatively low plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine that results from therapeutic dosing are not expected to raise a concern for significant drug -drug interactions. However, the concomitant use of CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 53 buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifung als such as ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors) should be monitored, and may require dose -reduction of one or both agents. The interaction of buprenorphine with CYP3A4 inducers has not been studied; therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving buprenorphine be monitored for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal treatment induction (performed before study screening) and therapy management during the trial are anticipated to greatly decrease the risk of precipit ating opioid withdrawal. 12.2 Prohibited Medications As described in the eligibility criteria, participants will be excluded from the study if there is a need for ongoing opioid analgesic treatment at any point during the study (including screening/baseline or following re -assessment during the trial). The study medical clinician may also exclude any participant taking medications that could interact adversely with the study drug at his/her clinical discretion. 12.3 Medications Allowed During the Study Participants will be instructed to contact the pharmacist and supervising clinician if they plan on taking any concomitant medications (including prescription, over -the-counter, and herbal supplements ) during the course of the study. At intake/baseline (Visit 1), all medications will be captured on the Concomitant Medications form. Changes to conconmitant medications will be recorded on the Buprenorphione Visit Checklist. 12.3.1 Ancillary Medicatio ns No ancillary medications use is expected. 12.3.2 Rescue Medications In the event a participant experiences opioid withdrawal during the study, this may be managed by adjusting the dose of buprenorphine. In case of prolonged discomfort, with or with out concomitant opioid abuse reported by the managing pharmacist, a decision may be made by the supervising physician (in concert with the LIs) to discontinue the participant from the study. Discontinued participants will be asked to complete an Early Term ination Visit. These participants will then be returned to physician care and/ or referred to local methadone treatment programs (see MOP for the management of patients receiving pharmacy -based OUD care ( SOP for OCA )). 13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 13.1 Ge neral Design 13.1.1 Study Hypothesis This is a feasibility study, and as such there are no a priori hypotheses. The main objective is to understand the feasibility regarding the study design features and operational procedures in order to inform the design of a full scale clinical trial (e.g., whether participants can be recruited in a timely fashion, whether the collaboration between OBBT physician and pharmacist can ensure standard buprenorphine maintenance care). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 54 13.1.2 Primary and Secondary Outcomes (Endpoints) As noted in Section 8.1, the main objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a full scale trial thus the primary outcome measures are as follows: Recruitment rate Retention in treatment Substance use (self -report and urine drug testing) Medication compliance The secondary outcomes are also itemized in Section 8.2. 13.1.3 Recruitment Based on the feedback from the local buprenorphine practice, it is anticipated that the clinical sites will each be able to recruit a sufficient number of participants who are stabilized on buprenorphine during the screening and baseline period to enroll 20 -30 into the maintenance phase. The main objective of this feasibility study is to assess the recruitm ent rate, so there will be no specific targeted recruitment rate for assessing clinical site performance. Whatever recruitment rate is observed will inform the results of this feasibility study. Note that it is possible for a consented participant to drop out or be lost to follow -up prior to initiating the maintenance phase of their buprenorphine treatment. The recruitment rate will be calculated using all participants consented, however the number of participants who enroll into the maintenance phase of th e study will also be tracked closely versus the number of potential participants that were consented. Additional details on participant recruitment are given in Section 7.3. 13.1.4 Randomization and Factors for Stratification This is not a randomized study, as the treatment arm is the same for all clinical sites. 13.2 Rationale for Sample Size and Statistical Power 13.2.1 General Approach As CTN -0075 is a feasibility study, there will be no hypothesis testing and thus performing sample size and/or power calculations are inappropriate. Instead, it is important to evaluate the precision with which primary outcome measures can be estimated. Particula rly, we focus on the width of confidence intervals for the following: (1) the marginal odds of a scheduled visit being attended (retention in treatment), (2) the number of days of self -reported opioid use in the 30 days prior to the six month follow -up vis it (opioid use), and (3) proportion of participants with an opiate -positive UDS at the six month follow -up visit (opioid use). 13.2.2 Projected Number of Study Sites The Lead Node and the NIDA CCTN have determined that it is only possible fiscally an d timelinewise to utilize approximately 3 -4 study sites for the CTN -0075 feasibility pilot study. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 55 13.2.3 Projected Number of Participants per Study Site Depending on the number of study physicians at a study site, each study site may enroll up to 2030 participants who are stabilized on buprenorphine into the maintenance phase. However, this is an outcome of the study and will not be considered when assessing performance of a study site during this pilot study. 13.2.4 Confidence Interval Estimation fo r Retention in Treatment The retention in treatment outcome measure is defined as an indicator of whether each of the six scheduled visits during the six month follow -up phase for each participant. Thus, there are two layers of correlation: visits within participants, and participants within site. To estimate the precision of the probability that any given follow -up was attended, we used simulations. Appendix C describes the approach to simulating the data for this outcome measure. For each simulated datas et, proc GLIMMIX (SAS 9.4) was used to model the log -odds of visit attendance and calculate the 95% confidence interval for the corresponding probability. Example code: proc glimmix data=simul; solution; random intercept / subject=site; random intercept estimate \"intercept\" intercept 1 / ilink cl; run; Generalized estimating equations (Liang and Zeger, 1986) were also conside red for the method of analysis, however the coverage probabilities were low and thus that approach is not reported here. Several other approaches (e.g., bootstrap, MCMC) were also considered but suffered from poor coverage as well and thus were dropped fro m consideration. The key parameters necessary for this set of simulations are (notation defined in Appendix C ): = P(visit attended) = independence parameter for visits within a participant / = relative contribution of study site effect to participant effect on As summarized in Figure 4, the confidence interval width decreases as the visits within a partic ipant become increasingly independent (\"abg(3)\" = 1). Further, the confidence interval width also decreases as the ratio of the site effect to the participant decreases (i.e., \"rat\" = / 0). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 56 Figure 4. Simulation Results for Precision in the Retention in Treatment Outcome Measure 13.2.5 Confidence Interval Estimation for Opioid Use (self -report and UDS -based) For the UDS -based opioid use outcome, data were simulated in a similar fashion to that for the retention in treatment except there is only one visit per participant (the six month follow -up visit). It is anticipated that the proportion of participants att ending the final six month follow -up visit who will have an opioid -positive UDS ranges from 20 -30% (Cunningham et al., 2013). Figure 5 provides a graphical summary of the simulation results. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 57 Figure 5. Simulation Results for Precision in the UDS -based Op ioid Use Outcome Measure The opioid use outcome measure based on self -report is the total number of days of opioid use, from TLFB, during the last 30 prior to the six month follow -up visit. The data for the precision simulations were also generated in a m anner similar to that for the retention in treatment outcome. In this instance, each day in the evaluation period is considered a \"visit\", thus t he \"abg3\" = parameter captures the relationship between days of self -reported use within a participant. As with the previous simulations, the closer is to 0, the greater the degree of correlation of days of use within a participant. Figure 6 summarizes the results of these precision simulations when the daily opioid use rates varies from 20 -40% (Cunningham et al., 2013, Rosenthal et al., 2016). CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 58 Figure 6. Simulation Results for Precision in the TLFB -based Opioid Use Outcome Measure 13.3 Statistical Methods for Primary and Secondary Outcomes For the primary outcomes, estimates and 95% confidence intervals w ill be constructed as described below. As there is only one arm in this pilot feasibility study, no statistical testing will be performed. Descriptive statistics, including measures of spread, will be reported. The remainder of this section provides basic information regarding the primary outcome measures. A separate Statistical Analysis Plan will be developed that provides additional details regarding the statistical methods for both the primary and secondary outcomes. 13.3.1 Recruitment Rate The recru itment rate will be estimated as the number of participants consented per month during the enrollment period. We will also calculate the number of participants reaching the maintenance phase on a per -month basis. These rates will also be calculated by site . 13.3.2 Retention in Treatment For a particular participant, this outcome measure is captured by a vector of length six, denoted by r (r1, ... r6), where each element of the vector is an indicator of whether the participant attended CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 59 the ith visit ( i=1, ..., 6) during the maintenance phase. This is outcome measure involves hierarchical clustering as follows: visits within participant, and participants within study site. Given the target effective sample size (e.g., study completers) of 45 participants , asymptotic confidence intervals will be constructed. Based on the poor coverage findings from the simulation studies presented in Section 13.2, a random effects model will be used to construct these intervals while adjusting for the two levels of cluster ing. 13.3.3 Substance Use Primary interest lies in opioid (licit and illicit) and heroin use. Both biological assessment of use, as well as self -reported use will be considered. For biological assessment, urine drug testing will be used for all substan ces . While we will focus on the six month follow -up visit, as has been done in other studies, we will also estimate substance use over all six visits during the maintenance phase. For self -reported use, the main outcome measure of interest is quantified a s the number of days of use of opioids/heroin in the 30 days prior to the six month follow -up visit. In addition, we will also examine daily use rates and evaluate patterns over time. Similar to the analyses described in Section 13.2.2, a random effects mo del will be used to construct the 95% confidence intervals while adjusting for the two levels of clustering. 13.3.4 Medication Compliance The operational definition of this outcome measure is the proportion of expected buprenorphine use in relation to actual use. The expected dose will be based on the number of milligrams expected based on the dispensed dose during the maintenance phase. The expected dose will accommodate adjustments to dosing made during the maintenance phase. The Statistical Analysis Plan will describe how compliance is calculated for early study terminations. 13.4 Significance Testing Significance testing will not be co nducted in this pilot study of feasibility. Section 13.3 describes the statistics and analytic approaches that will be used to summarize the data. 13.5 Interim Analysis No interim analyses for efficacy or futility are planned for this study. Safety and d ata quality reports will be prepared for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and they may request interim analyses at any time during the trial. 13.6 Exploratory Analysis Given the small sample size and the limited scope of this trial, every effort w ill be made to minimize any post hoc exploration of the data entered into Advantage eClinical. 13.7 Missing Data and Dropouts For simplicity in this small pilot study, all missing data will be handled as follows for the four primary outcome measures : 1. Recruitment rate - no missing data 2. Retention in treatment - no missing data CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 60 3. Substance use a. Any day with missing self -reported substance use during the last 30 days of the 24 week follow -up period will be imputed as non -abstinent b. A missing UDS at the six month follow -up visit, for any reason, will be imputed positive 4. Medication compliance - no missing data Should there be a substantial amount of missing data for the substance use outcomes, a sensitivity analysis may be implemented to see how the esti mated outcome measures are impacted by deviations from the imputation schemes specified above. 13.8 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be summarized for participants enrolled in the maintenance phase. Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous baseline variables will be presented with percentiles (median, 25th and 75th percenti les), and with mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables will be summarized in terms of frequencies and percentages. The NIH requires subgroup analyses by gender, race and ethnicity (NIH, 2016). Given the scope of this study, all primary outcome m easures will be summarized by these three factors but there will be no testing for differences across the demographic groups. 13.9 Safety Analysis All protocol -defined safety events reported on the SERC -75 will be coded for body system and preferred te rm using MedDRA codes (per The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). Safety events on the SERC -75 will be summarized by frequency in the screening phase and maintenance phase. Listings of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, overdoses, a nd deaths will include system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Suicide risk from the P4 Screener will be assessed and presented in a listing. 14.0 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND SAFETY 14.1 Regulatory Compliance This study will comply with all appl icable rules and regulations. These include requirements of having received federal funding and the HIPAA requirements for data. 14.2 Statement of Compliance This trial will be conducted in compliance with the appropriate protocol, current Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all other applicable regulatory requirements. Participating sites must obtain written approval of the study protocol, consent form, other supporting documents, and any advertising for parti cipant recruitment from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Record in order to participate in the study. Prior to study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent document(s) will be reviewed and approved by an appropriate Ethics Review Committe e (ERC) or IRB. Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must be approved before they are implemented. Annual progress reports and local Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reports will be submitted to the IRB, according to its usual procedures. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 61 14.3 I nstitutional Review Board Approval Prior to initiating the study, the Lead Node will obtain written IRB approval to conduct the study from a single IRB. Further, each site investigator will be required to set up a written IRB Reliance (Authorization) Agre ement to name the single IRB as the IRB of Record for the study. The reliance agreement will also contain information about how communication between the participating site and the single IRB will take place. Should changes to the study protocol become nec essary, protocol amendments will be submitted in writing by the Lead Node for IRB approval from the single IRB prior to implementation. In addition, the IRB will approve all consent forms, recruitment materials, and any materials given to the participant. Annual reports and progress reports will be submitted to the IRB annually or at a frequency requested by the IRB so that continuous study approval is maintained without lapse. Lead Investigators (LIs) will be responsible for maintaining in their research f iles copies of all performance site(s) current IRB/IEC approval notice(s), IRBapproved consent document(s), including approval for all protocol modifications. These materials must be received by LIs prior to the initiation of research activities at a given site, and must be available at any time for audit. 14.4 Informed Consent The informed consent process is a means of providing study information to each prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study. The informed consent form will include all of the required elements of informed con sent. The study informed consent (and any updates made to the consent form throughout the trial) will be approved by the IRB prior to use. A copy of the IRB -approved consent, along with the IRB study approval, must be sent to the Clinical Coordinating Cent er (CCC) and the Lead Node (LN) (as needed) prior to the site initiation visit and with each subsequent consent revision. Every study participant is required to sign a valid, IRB -approved current version of the study informed consent form prior to the init iation of any study related procedures. The site must maintain the original signed informed consent for every participant in a locked, secure location that is in compliance with the IRB and any applicable institutional policies and that is accessible to th e study monitors. Every study participant should be given a copy of the signed consent form. Prior to informed consent, research staff will explain the study to the potential participant and provide a copy of the consent to read. If the participant is int erested in participating in the study, a staff member will review each section of the informed consent form in detail and answer any questions the participant may pose. The participant will consent by signing and dating the consent document. The person obt aining consent and a witness, if required by the IRB, will also sign and date the consent document. It is strongly recommended that another research staff member review the consent after it is signed to ensure that the consent is properly executed and comp lete. Staff members delegated by the PI to obtain informed consent must be listed on the Site Staff Delegation of Responsibilities and Signature Log and must be approved by the IRB, if required. All persons obtaining consent must have completed appropriate training. The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety information is available, or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect participants' participation in the trial. A copy of the informed consent w ill be given to a prospective participant to review during the consent process and to keep for reference. The participant will be informed that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason without penalt y. Individuals who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice. Study sites will be responsible for maintaining signed consent forms as source documents for quality assurance review and regulatory compliance. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 62 14.5 Confidentiality Confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with all applicable federal regulations and/or state/Commonwealth law and regulations. By signing the protocol signature page, the investigator affirms that information furnished to the in vestigator by NIDA will be maintained in confidence and such information will be divulged to the IRB, Ethical Review Committee, or similar expert committee; affiliated institution; and employees only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality wi th such board or committee, affiliated institution and employees. The lead investigator will obtain a federal Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC), protecting participants against disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., substance use), and will distribu te it to all sites when received. If applicable, the NIH office that issues the CoC will be advised of changes in the CoC application information. Participating sites will be notified if CoC revision is necessary. Participant records will be held confident ial by the use of study codes for identifying participants on CRFs, secure storage of any documents that have participant identifiers, and secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data. There is the potential risk of loss of c onfidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep participants' information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. 14.5.1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Study sites may be required by their institutions to obtain authorization from participants for use of protected health information. Sites will be responsible for communicating with their IRBs or Privacy Boards and obtaining the appropriate approvals or wa ivers to be in regulatory compliance. Releases of participant identifying information that are permitted by the HIPAA regulations, but which are prohibited by other applicable federal regulations and/or state/Commonwealth law and regulation, are prohibited . 14.6 Investigator Assurances Each research site must file (or have previously filed) a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) with the HHS Office for Human Research Protection setting forth the commitment of the organization to establish appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human research subjects, with documentation sent to NIDA or its designee. Research covered by these regulations cannot proceed in any manner prior to NIDA receipt of certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB provided for in the assurance (45 CFR 46.103(b) and (f)). Prior to initiating the study, the Principal Investigator at each study site will sign a protocol signature page, providing assurances that the study will be performed according to the standards stipulated therein. 14.6.1 Financial Disclosure All investigators will comply with the requirements of 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F to ensure that the design, conduct, and reporting of the research will not be biased by any conflicting fina ncial interest. Everyone with decision -making responsibilities regarding the protocol will confirm to the sponsor annually that they have met their institutional financial disclosure requirements. 14.6.2 DEA Registration All DEA requirements must be me t, including registration, inspection if required, and certification, as applicable. Additionally, dispensing any controlled substance requires a DEA registration unless exempt by federal or state law or pursuant to CFR Sections 1301.22 -1301.26. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 63 Buprenorph ine physicians and pharmacists will operate with their own buprenorphine DEA numbers. 14.7 Clinical Monitoring Investigators will host periodic visits by NIDA contract monitors who will examine whether study procedures are conducted appropriately and tha t study data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations. These monitors will audit, at mutually agreed upon times, regulatory documents, case report forms (CRFs), informed consent forms and corre sponding source documents for each participant. Monitors will have the opportunity and ability to review any study -associated document or file. NIDA -contracted monitors will assess whether submitted data are accurate and in agreement with source documenta tion and will also review regulatory/essential documents such as correspondence with the IRB. Areas of particular concern will be participant informed consent forms, protocol adherence, reported safety events and corresponding assessments, and Principal Investigator oversight and involvement in the trial. Reports will be prepared following the visit and forwarded to the site Principal Investigator, the Lead Investigator and NIDA CCTN. Qualified node personnel and NIDA CCTN CCC staff will provide site manag ement for each site during the trial. Node and CCC staff will audit source documentation, including informed consent forms and HIPAA forms. This will take place as specified by the local protocol team, node PI or lead team, and will occur as often as neede d, and is feasible, to help prevent, detect, and correct problems at the study sites. Node and CCC personnel will verify that study procedures are properly followed and that site personnel are trained and able to conduct the protocol appropriately. If the node personnel or CCC's review of study documentation indicates that additional training of site study personnel is needed, node and/or CCC personnel will undertake or arrange for that training. Details regarding monitoring are found in the study monitorin g plan. 14.8 Inclusion of Women and Minorities The study sites should aim and take steps to enroll a diverse study population. If difficulty is encountered in recruiting an adequate number of women and/or minorities, the difficulties involved in recruitm ent will be discussed in national conference calls and/or face -to-face meetings, encouraging such strategies as linkages with medical sites and/or treatment programs that serve a large number of women and/or minorities, advertising in newspapers or radio s tations with a high female/minority readership/listening audience, etc. Female -Specific Risks Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks, some of which may be currently unforeseeable. Therefore, pregnant women will be excluded from the study. Women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test completed during screening (using 1 teaspoon of blood drawn from a vein by needle -stick). The pregnancy test must yield a negative result before the participant can continue in the study. If sexually active, women who consent to the study and are of childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures while participating in the study. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, NOT tubal litigation/cauterizatio n or vasectomy of male partner), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contracep tive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 64 methods for routine use. In addition to the confirmatory urine pregnancy test conducted at the pharmacy following Visit 1, immediately prior to dispensation of the first dose of study medication, urine pregnancy tests will be performed at study visits 2 through 7. Women are asked to inform the study pharmacist and physician immediately if they become pregnant during this study or have unprotected sex. 14.9 R egulatory Files The regulatory files should contain all required regulatory documents, study -specific documents, and all important communications. Regulatory files will be checked at each participating site for regulatory document compliance prior to stud y initiation, throughout the study, as well as at study closure. 14.10 Records Retention and Requirements Research records for all study participants (e.g., case report forms, source documents, signed consent forms, and regulatory files) are to be mainta ined by the investigator in a secure location for a minimum of 3 years after the study is completed and closed. These records are also to be maintained in compliance with IRB, state and federal requirements, whichever is longest. The sponsor and Lead Inves tigator must be notified in writing and acknowledgment must be received by the site prior to the destruction or relocation of research records. 14.11 Reporting to Sponsor The site Principal Investigator agrees to submit accurate, complete, legible and ti mely reports to the Sponsor, as required. These include, but are not limited to, reports of any changes that significantly affect the conduct or outcome of the trial or increase risk to study participants. Safey event reporting will occur as previously des cribed. At the completion of the trial, the Lead Investigator will provide a final report to the Sponsor. 14.12 Audits The Sponsor has an obligation to ensure that this trial is conducted according to good research practice guidelines and may perform qua lity assurance audits for protocol compliance. The Lead Investigator and authorized staff from the Mid Southern Node; the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (NIDA CTN, the study sponsor); NIDA's contracted agents, monitors or auditors ; and other agencies such as HHS, the Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) and the Institutional Review Board may inspect research records for verification of data, compliance with federal guidelines on human participant research, and to assess part icipant safety. 14.13 Study Documentation Study documentation includes all case report forms, workbooks, source documents, monitoring logs and appointment schedules, sponsor -investigator correspondence, signed protocol and amendments, Ethics Review Commi ttee or Institutional Review Committee correspondence and approved consent form and signed participant consent forms. Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 65 document; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact duplica tion of the original document. 14.14 Protocol Deviations Any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol will be classified as either a major or minor protocol deviation. The difference between a major and minor protocol deviation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A minor protocol deviation is considered an action (or inaction) that by itself is not likely to affect the scientific soundness of the investigation or seriously affect the s afety, rights, or welfare of a study participant. Major protocol deviations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or the integrity of study data and could be cause for corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re -occurrence. Sites will be responsible for developing corrective action plans for both major and minor deviations as appropriate. Those corrective action plans may be reviewed/approved by the Lead Node and the CCC with overall approval by the IRB. All protocol deviations will be monitored at each site for (1) significance, (2) frequency, and (3) impact on the study objectives, to ensure that site performance does not compromise the integrity of the trial. All protocol deviations will be recorded in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system via the Protocol Deviation CRF. The CCC, DSC and the Lead Investigator must be contacted immediately if an unqualified or ineligible participant is consented and enrolled into the stu dy. Additionally, each site is responsible for reviewing the IRB's definition of a protocol deviation or violation and understanding which events need to be reported. Sites must recognize that the CTN and IRB definition of a reportable event may differ an d act accordingly in following all reporting requirements for both entities. 14.15 Safety Monitoring 14.15.1 Safety Events All protocol -defined safety events (medical and/or psychiatric) occurring during the course of the study will be assessed, documented, and reported. Safety events occurring during the course of the clinical trial will be collected, documented, and reported by the Princ ipal Investigator or subinvestigators according to the specific instructions detailed in this section of the protocol. Appropriately qualified and trained personnel will elicit participant reporting of safety events at each study visit designated to collec t safety events (i.e., the first visit following informed consent and at every study visit thereafter). A study medical clinician (MD, DO, PA, or NP) will review or provide consultation for each safety event as necessary. The study medical clinician and site Principal Investigator (if different) will also make decisions to exclude, refer, or withdraw participants as required. The study staff will be trained to monitor for and report safety events. 14.15.2 Reportable Safety Events For the purposes of this protocol, the following safety events will be collected and reported: headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, insomnia, excessive sweating, increased sensitivity in the mouth, burning sensation in the mouth, sores in the mouth, pain, swelling, overd oses, ED visits, hospitalizations, and death of any participant who provides informed consent in this study. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 66 The local site is responsible for the reporting of safety events to their local IRB and/or the IRB of Record per applicable IRB guidelines. 14.15.3 Medical Monitor and Safety Monitor Under the supervision of the NIDA -assigned Medical Monitor, the study Safety Monitor will be responsible for overseeing safety and for evaluating all safety events. The Safety Monitor will review all reported safet y events on a regular basis. The Medical Monitor will review events regularly and will be available at all times for consultation. Where further information is needed, the Safety Monitor will discuss the event with the site. It is the responsibility of the site Principal Investigator to provide this information to the Safety Monitor. It is also the site Principal Investigators' responsibility to inform the IRB per IRB guidelines. The Medical Monitor will independently review the safety data, present it to the DSMB for periodic review, and provide PIs a Safety Letter when necessary for submission to the IRB for regulatory compliance. The Medical Monitor will determine which safety events require expedited reporting to NIDA, the DSMB, pharmaceutical/distribut ors, and regulatory authorities. This will include events that are serious, related, and unexpected (SUSAR). 14.15.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) This study will utilize the CTN DSMB to oversee ongoing trial progress and examine accumulating data to assure protection of participants' safety while the study's scientific goals are being met. The purpose of this board is to determine whether risks emerge during t he conduct of the trial that make continuation unethical. This process is intended to assure the IRBs, the sponsor, and investigators that participants are provided with an accurate and ongoing risk evaluation when participating in CTN research trials. It will determine whether there is support for continuation of the trial, evidence that study procedures should be changed, or if the trial should be halted, for reasons relating to the safety of the study participants, the efficacy of the treatment under stu dy, or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor recruitment). Safety monitoring begins with the initial review of the protocol during the study development process. The CTN DSMB is responsible for conducting periodic reviews of accumulating safety and effi cacy data. The DSMB will meet at least annually. Recommendations from these reviews will be distributed to site investigators and submitted to the IRB. 14.15.5 Known Potential Toxicities of Study Drug Refer to package insert in Appendix B . 14.15.6 Pot ential Events Related to the Underlying Clinical Condition and/or Study Populations Each of the participating research sites have established practices for managing medical and psychiatric emergencies, and the study staff will continue to utilize these pr ocedures. Participants at each research site will be referred for medical care in the event of possible clinical deterioration or other problems, and for implementing appropriate courses of action. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 67 14.15.7 Additional Study -Specific Risks Buprenorphine Side Effects Side effects commonly observed with the administration of BUP -NX sublingual (under the tongue) film include sore mouth, partial loss of sensation of touch, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, signs and symptoms of withdrawal, insomnia, pain, and swelling of the limbs. The long-term side effects of BUP -NX are unknown at the present time. It is also possible that a patient may have a hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to BUP -NX. The most common signs and symptoms of having an allergic reaction include rashes, hives, and itching. More serious, but less common occurrences include those related to anaphylactic shock such as difficulty breathing. To minimize the risk of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, the study doctor will ask each participant if he or she has taken buprenorphine/naloxone prior to entering the study to see if he or she has had a previous allergic reaction or increased sensitivity to the medication or any of its components. BUP-NX itself causes physical dependence an d can result in withdrawal symptoms when BUPNX is stopped. BUP -NX can also cause drowsiness and breathing that is slow and shallow. A number of deaths have been reported in people who abuse BUP -NX in combination with benzodiazepines, such as Valium or sle eping pills. Combining BUP -NX with alcohol or other drugs may be hazardous. Patients must not drink alcohol -containing beverages or take other drugs including benzodiazepines, like Valium or sleeping pills, or narcotic pain relievers, while using BUP-NX. P atients who are receiving benzodiazepine treatment by another physician will only be able to participate in the study if his or her doctor monitors their prescriptions during the study. Patients should not inject (\"shoot -up\") BUP -NX. Injecting BUP -NX may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, sleep problems, and cravings. BUP-NX may also impair mental or physical abilities involved in such activities as driving or operating machinery. Patients are advised not to engage in such activities for at least 6 hours after taking the first dose of BUP -NX. The researchers will be happy t o discuss alternative methods of transportation with patients, such as getting a ride from a family member or friend, or taking a taxi or bus. Risks of Buprenorphine Misuse As buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist medication, missing one or more dose s during treatment could result in opioid withdrawal. Use of full opioid agents (e.g., heroin or prescription opioid medications) during treatment may result in lack of effects or trigger opioid withdrawal discomfort. Administering a large amount of exogen ous opioids to overcome such symptoms could result in potentially life -threatening opioid intoxication and overdose. Use of sedative substances (e.g., alcohol and benzodiazepines) in addition to buprenorphine could lead to excessive sedation and respirator y depression. Patients are advised to discuss these risks with the study pharmacist and doctor if they so choose. Risks of Drawing Blood Risks associated with drawing blood from the arm include momentary discomfort and/or bruising. Infection, excess ble eding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 68 Drug Interactions For the participant's safety, participants must tell the study pharmacist, doctor, and staff about all of the prescribed medical foods and drugs, herbal products, over -the-counter (OTC) drugs, vitamins, natural remedies, and alcohol that he or she is taking before starting the study. Participants must also tell the study pharmacist, doctor, and staff before starting to take any of these products while enrolled in the stud y. Other Risks Some of the questions the researchers will ask participants as part of this study may make participants feel uncomfortable. Participants may decline to answer any of the questions and participants may take a break at any time during the s tudy visits. Participants may stop their participation in this study at any time. There may be risks, discomforts, drug interactions or side effects that are not yet known. 15.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROCEDURES 15.1 Design and Development This protocol will utilize a centralized Data and Statistics Center (DSC). The DSC will be responsible for the development of the case report forms (CRFs), development and validation of the clinical study database, ensuring data integrity, and training site and partici pating node staff on applicable data management procedures. A web -based distributed data entry model will be implemented. This electronic data capture system (Advantage eClinical) will be developed to ensure that guidelines and regulations surrounding the use of computerized systems used in clinical trials are upheld. The remainder of this section provides an overview of the data management plan associated with this protocol. 15.2 Site Responsibilities The data management responsibilities of each site wil l be specified by the Lead Node and the DSC. 15.3 Data Center Responsibilities The DSC will 1) develop and apply data management procedures to ensure the collection of accurate and good -quality data, 2) provide final Case Report Forms (CRFs) and electronic CRFs (eCRFs) for the collection of all data required by the study, 3) develop data dictionaries for each CRF that will comprehensively define each data element, 4) prepare instructions for the use of Advantage eClinical and for the completion of CRFs, 5) conduct ongoing data validation and cleaning activities on study data collected from all study sites, and 6) perform data validation and cleaning activities prior to any interim analyses and prior to the final study database lock. 15.4 Data Acquisition and Entry Data will be collected at the study sites on source documents and entered by the site into eCRFs in Advantage eClinical, or will be collected via direct entry into the eCRF. In the event that Advantage eClinical is not available, the DSC will provide the s ites with paper CRF source documents and completion instructions. Data will be entered into Advantage eClinical in accordance with the instructions provided during protocol -specific training and guidelines CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 69 established by the DSC. Data entry into the eCRFs shall be performed by authorized individuals. Selected eCRFs may also require the investigator's electronic signature. The Principal Investigator at each site is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete and upto - date research records. In addition, t he investigator is responsible for ensuring the timely completion of eCRFs for each research participant. 15.5 Data Editing Data will be entered into the DSC automated data acquisition and management system (Advantage eClinical). eCRFs will be monitored for completeness and accuracy throughout the study. Dynamic reports listing missing values and forms are available to sites at all times in Advantage eClinical. These reports will be monitored regularly by the DSC. In addition, the DSC will identify incon sistencies within eCRFs and between eCRFs and post data clarification requests or queries in Advantage eClinical on a scheduled basis. Sites will resolve data inconsistencies and errors by entering all corrections and changes directly into Advantage eClini cal. The CCC will conduct regular on -site and remote visits, during which audits comparing source documents to the data entered on the eCRF will be performed. Any discrepancies identified between the source document and the eCRF will be corrected by the s ite. Trial progress and data status reports, which provide information on recruitment, availability of primary outcome, treatment exposure, regulatory status, and data quality, will be generated daily and posted to a secure website. These reports are avai lable to the site, the corresponding node, the lead node, the coordinating centers, and NIDA to monitor study progress overall and at each individual participating site. 15.6 Data Transfer/Lock At the conclusion of data collection for the study, the DSC will perform final cleaning activities and will \"lock\" the study database from further modification. The final analysis datasets will be transferred to the Lead Investigator and to NIDA, as requested, for storage and archiving. 15.7 Data Training The tra ining plan for site staff includes provisions for training on assessments, eCRF completion guidelines, data management procedures, and the use of Advantage eClinical. 15.8 Data Quality Assurance To address the issue of data entry quality, the DSC will f ollow a standard data monitoring plan. An acceptable quality level prior to study lock or closeout will be established as a part of the data management plan. Data quality summaries will be made available during the course of the protocol. 16.0 TRAINING RE QUIREMENTS The study staff will be trained as specified in the study Training Plan. Required training will include Human Subjects Protection (HSP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as well as protocol -specific training as needed (e.g., assessments, study interventions, fidelity to protocol, safety procedures, data management and collection, and other research procedures). Attention will be given to provide the study clinic staff physicians and pharmacists training in management of OUD, CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 70 buprenorphine induct ion and maintenance, and to familiarize study personnel with study procedures. Support mechanisms are identified (e.g., who to contact for aid, questions, resources), as well as re -training procedures. All study staff will also be required to complete any training requirements per their study site and IRB requirements. Training in study -specific assessments will be provided as specified in a comprehensive training plan that will be developed by the Lead Node, the CCC, and the DSC. All non -intervention trai ning is expected to be delivered via conference call, webinar and self -study. Research staff (and all other study personnel) will receive HSP and GCP training through the web -based system currently in use. The CTN -0075 Training Plan will provide a detailed description of training, supervision, and fidelity monitoring procedures. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 71 17.0 PUBLICATIONS AND OTHER RIGHTS Per NIH policy, the results of the proposed trial are to be made available to the research community and to the public at large.

Secondary objectives are to generate point estimates for treatment fidelity and satisfact ion, participant safety, and use of PDMP and the EHRs. CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 80 20.2 Oversight of Clinical Responsibilities A. Site Principal Investigator Each participating site's Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for study oversight, including ensuring human research subject protection by designating appropriately qualified, trained research staff and medical clinicians to assess, report, and monitor safety events. All protocol -defined reportable safety events occurring during the course of the clinical trial will b e collected, documented, and reported by the investigator or sub -investigators according to the protocol. The occurrence of safety events will be assessed at each visit during the study. Reportable safety events are required to be entered into the dat a system within 48 hoursof the site staff becoming aware of the event by completing the checklist. Deaths are required to be entered into the data system within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the event. B. CCC Medical Monitor The NIDA CTN Clinical Coordinating Center's (CCC) Medical Monitor or designee is responsible for reviewing all safety events reported. Where further information is needed the Medical Monitor or designee will discuss the event with the site staff. All safety events are reviewed on a regular basis to observe trends or unusual events. Voluntary Regulatory Reporting in non -IND Trials: For non -IND trials, if an event meets expedited reporting criteria (serious, related and unexpected) the CCC Medical Monitor or designee will volunt arily report to FDA/Regulatory Authorities using the MedWatch Form 3500 or similar. C. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) The NIDA CTN DSMB affiliated with this trial will be responsible for conducting periodic reviews of accumulating safety, trial performance, and outcome data. Reports will be generated and presented for Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meetings. The DSMB will receive listings of safety events and summary reports of all deaths at a frequency requested by the DSMB, but at least annually. Furthermore, the DSMB will be informed of expedited reports of safety events. The DSMB will make recommendations to N IDA CCTN as to whether there is sufficient support for continuation of the trial, evidence that study procedures should be changed, or evidence that the trial (or a specific site) should be halted for reasons relating to safety of the study participants or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor recruitment). Following each DSMB meeting, the NIDA CCTN will communicate the outcomes of the meeting, based on DSMB recommendations, in writing to the study Lead Investigator. This communication summarizing study safety information will be submitted to participating IRBs. D. Quality Assurance (QA) Monitoring The monitoring of the study sites will be conducted on a regular basis by the NIDA CTN CCC. Investigators will host periodic visits for the NIDA CTN CCC mon itors. The purpose of these visits is to assess compliance with GCP requirements and to document the integrity of the trial progress. Areas of particular concern will be the review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, participant Informed Consent Forms, protoc ol adherence, safety monitoring, IRB reviews and approvals, regulatory CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 81 documents, participant records, study drug accountability, and Principal Investigator supervision and involvement in the trial. The monitors will interact with the site staff to identif y issues and retrain the site as needed to enhance research quality. Site Visit Reports will be prepared by the NIDA CCC monitors following each site visit. These reports will be sent to the site Principal Investigator, the study Lead Investigator and NID A CCTN. E. Management of Risks to Participants Confidentiality Confidentiality of participant records will be secured by the use of study codes for identifying participants on CRFs, and secure storage of any documents that have participant identifiers on site, as well as secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data. The documents or logs linking the study codes with the study participant on site will be kept locked separately from the study files and the medical records. No id entifying information will be disclosed in reports, publications or presentations. Information Meeting Reporting Requirements The consent form will specifically state the types of information that are required for reporting and that the information will be reported as required. These include suspected or known sexual or physical abuse of a child or elders, or threatened violence to self and/or others. Participant Protection The site's study clinician will evaluate all pertinent screening and baseline as sessments prior to commencing the study intervention to ensure that the participant is eligible and safe to enter the study. Safety events and concomitant medications will be assessed and documented at each clinic visit. Individuals who experience a safety event that compromises safe participation in the study will be discontinued from further medication administration and provided referrals for other treatment or to specialized care. Study personnel will request that the participant complete an Early Termi nation Visit to assure safety and to document end -of-medication outcomes.

Each scenario had 10,000 iterations. The scenarios were defined by the following parameters: CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 113 1. = the probability of a pos itive response at a given time, for a given patient, in a given site. That is, we assumed that this probability would be constant across all study sites, patients, and times. 2. (, , ), where all terms are positive and + + = 1. The se parameters, which control the correlation structure of the outcomes, have the following intuitive explanations: a. is the \"independence \" parameter. The closer is to 1, the more independent all the outcomes are from each other. b. is the \"site importance \" parameter. For a given , the larger is, the bigger the influence of the study site (in comparison to the influence of the patient), upon the correlation between observations. c. is the \"patient importance \" parameter. For a given , the larger is, the bigger the influence of the patient (in comparison to the influence of the study site), upon the correlation between observations. We assume that all the observations of a given patient have a compound -symmetric correlation structure. From the point of view of estimating the probability of success, this is a more pessimistic assumption than assuming the observations of a given patient have an AR(1) or other time series correlation structure. So we assume that the precision results of our simulation will be conservative with respect to real life data. We explored the effect of the simulation parameters on the width of the 95% confidence interval of the probability of success. For each iteration of the s imulation: 1. Flip S independent coins, one for each of the S study sites, and also SP independent coins, one for each of the P patients at each site, and also TSP coins, one for each of the T time points for each patient at each site. All these coins have P (heads) = . Name the study site outcomes 1, ... , , the patient outcomes 11, ... , , and the time outcomes 111, ... . Each will be 1 or 0, depending on whether the corresponding coin -flip was Heads or Ta ils, and is a latent random variable in the simulation. 2. For each time t for patient p at study site s, calculate = + + . The s are also latent random variables. 3. For each patient p at study site s, time t, calculate his observed (i.e., non -latent) outcome by flipping an independent coin with P(heads) = . Each will be 1 or 0, depending on whether the corresponding coin flip was either Heads or Tails. It is shown below that ( ) = , ( ) = (1 ), and the X 's have the following correlation structure: 0 if corr( , ) = 2+2 2if = and ,and CTN-0075 Version 7.0 Pharm -OUD -Care January 25, 2019 114 1 if = , = , and = The algebra to demonstrate these moments follows. Theorem - Let = = 2, 2,, ~Bernoulli( ), and ~Bernoulli( ). Note that , on . Then: 1. () = () 3. (, ) = , Proof: (1) follows using conditional expected values. (2) follows because X and Y are (0,1) random variables for which (1) is true. (3) follows using the law of total covariance, i.e.: (, ) = ,[ (, = 0 + (, ) = , Now, let = = where = = 1, all (, ) are non -negative, and each ~Bernoulli( ). Note that and meet the conditions of the Theorem. This means that () = () = . The statement above follows on choosing , , , , and the Z 's as given in the description of the simulation. "}
