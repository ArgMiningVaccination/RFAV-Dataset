PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER5Multidisciplinary care is a hallmark of our approach to treatment at St. Peter's Hospital Cancer Care Center. No matter the cancer site \u2014 be it breast or prostate, lung, pancreas, colon, or elsewhere \u2014 a highly specialized team of physicians examines each patient's case thoroughly during our regular tumor board conferences. Working as a team of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and surgeons allows us to tailor treatment plans to the unique needs of each patient. We believe patient-centered care can make all the difference when it comes to diagnosing and treating cancer. This personalized patient care drives the exceptional quality and excellent outcomes we offer.

One in eight women will face breast cancer in her lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer in the United States, and the most prevalent cancer site we treat at St. Peter's Hospital. The essence of our breast cancer program is its combination of prompt care, expertise, and the most modern, specialized breast-imaging technology, including 3-D mammography. We meet or exceed all national guidelines for hormone, radiation, combination chemotherapy, and diagnostic procedures. We are dedicated to providing the highest level of care possible for our patients. With that in mind, St. Peter's breast health navigator, a certified breast health nurse, provides support and guidance to help patients \"navigate\" through the complex health care network. Dedicated to more than just clinical care, we take a holistic approach to treating breast cancer. Our breast health team cares for the whole patient \u2014 mind, body, and spirit. BREAST ULTRASOUND Enables further evaluation of masses found during a physical exam or mammography. Ultrasound is the only way to determine if a mass is a cyst (fluid-filled) without placement of a needle. When needle biopsy is needed, breast ultrasound can help guide the needle.BREAST MRI A very effective tool for detecting small cancers in younger women and staging cancer.DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY Offers superior image quality in helping to detect cancer in its very early stages, often years before it is large enough to be felt as a lump. Mammography is currently the best method of screening. ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER7 BREAST IMAGING CENTER OF EXCELLENCE1ST IN THE CAPITAL REGION St. Peter's Hospital was the first center in the Capital Region to be named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology (ACR). This designation is given to imaging centers that have achieved high practice standards in image quality, personnel qualifications, facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs.

BREAST-CONSERVING SURGERY Also known as a lumpectomy, removes tumor and limited surrounding tissue. BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY Can help restore the look and feel of the breast after a mastectomy. Performed by a plastic surgeon, breast reconstruction can be done at the same time as the mastectomy or at a later time. ESSENTIALS OF SURVIVORSHIP Designed from evidence-based studies, our Essentials of Survivorship program helps improve treatment outcomes and patients' overall quality of life after treatment. The program helps patients: aIncrease physical strength and prepare for treatment aManage side effects and maintain strength during treatment aMonitor health after treatment and return to previous activity levelsLEADING-EDGE CARE FOR BREAST CANCER SURGERY OPTIONS ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER8Thoracic Cancer We offer the most advanced treatment of thoracic cancer. Thoracic cancer refers to cancer of the chest region. Lung cancer is the most common form of thoracic cancer, and is the second most prevalent cancer site we treat at St. Peter's Hospital. Also included in thoracic is esophageal cancer \u2014 the fastest growing form of cancer in the United States. Thoracic care at St. Peter's Hospital brings together experts from different medical specialties, providing patients a broad range of treatment options. Our team of radiation oncologists provide technologically advanced treatment of lung cancer through precisely targeted stereotactic radiosurgery. Our highly experienced thoracic surgeons offer minimally invasive diagnostic and surgical techniques whenever possible to help speed patients' recovery. At the forefront of prevention and treatment for esophageal cancer, our advanced interventional endoscopists offer state-of-the-art techniques for removal of precancerous cells and early-stage cancer in the esophagus. These minimally invasive, outpatient procedures have been proven to stop cancer in its tracks, offering a 90 percent cure rate. RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION (RFA) RFA is minimally invasive, endoscopic delivery of quick bursts of controlled heat to remove abnormal, precancerous cells caused by Barrett's esophagus.ENDOSCOPIC PREVENTION & REMOVAL OF ESOPHAGEAL CANCER ENDOSCOPIC REMOVAL OF EARL Y-STAGE CANCER Endoscopic submucosal dissection and mucosal resection are incisionless procedures to remove early-stage esophageal cancer, and offer a 90 percent cure rate. THE MOST ADVANCED TREATMENTS STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY aPrecise, uniform radiation directly to tumor aNo incisions, no anesthesia and no scarring aPainless, outpatient treatment a15- to 45-minute treatments aCompleted in as few as four treatments 100 % ADHERENCE TO NATIONAL GUIDELINES We adhere to the national guidelines for administering chemotherapy within four to six months of surgery. ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER9NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER Adenocarcinoma - Typically begins growing near the outside surface of the lung, and ranges in size and growth rate. Squamous cell carcinoma - Often begins in one of the larger breathing tubes, near the center of the chest. Tumor size varies. Large cell carcinoma - Usually begins near the surface of the lung and grows rapidly. It is typically diagnosed after it has progressed. SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER Small cell lung cancer is much less common than non-small cell lung cancer, and accounts for only 15 percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States. This type of lung cancer is fast-progressing and spreads to other parts of the body quickly. It is typically quite advanced by the time it is diagnosed. 600 SURGERIES ANNUALL Y We have a highly experienced thoracic surgical team. Our surgeons perform all diagnostics, including mediastinoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound. MEDIASTINOSCOPY Enables visualization of the upper chest, in front of the lungs, to obtain a biopsy and stage of lung cancer. ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND An incisionless procedure for diagnosing and staging lung cancer. It can also be used to perform fine-needle aspiration.HIGHL Y SKILLED SURGEONS EDUCATION & AWARENESS St. Peter's Hospital works to increase awareness of the dangers of smoking, and prevent lung cancer in our community. In 2014, we hosted the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout. The event included educational activities comprised of a series of interactive displays manned by St. Peter's Hospital staff. Participants then answered questions quizzing them on the content of the activities and displays. Sixty-five percent of respondents scored 100 percent on the quiz, with 85 percent reporting the activities as relevant to their health.LUNG CANCERS TREATED ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER10Gynecologic Cancer We provide multidisciplinary care, including genetic counseling. Gynecologic cancer is cancer that begins within a woman's reproductive organs. The most common gynecologic cancers are found in the ovaries, uterus, cervix, vulva, and vagina. At St. Peter's Hospital, uterine cancer is the third most prevalent cancer site we treat. Cervical cancer - Begins in the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus. Ovarian cancer - Starts in the ovaries, which flank the uterus. Uterine cancer - Begins in the uterus, the pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis. Vaginal cancer - Begins in the vagina, the channel connecting the uterus and the outside of the body. Vulvar cancer - Starts in the vulva, which is the outer part of the female genital organs. Treatment for gynecologic cancers depends on the type and stage of the cancer. Options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and experimental treatments.LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY For some gynecologic cancers, laparoscopic surgical procedures can be used to evaluate and possibly remove abnormal growths, such as tumors, in the pelvis. During this procedure, the surgeon uses long, hand-held surgical instruments and operates through small incisions.1ST IN NYS FOR ROBOTIC SURGERY Our gynecologic oncologists were the first surgeons in New York state to use the state-of-the-art da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System. This robotic surgical system is so precise that instruments recheck their positions by computer 1,500 times per second, offering many advantages to the patient. Complex procedures are safer and more effective with robotic surgical assistance, and allow patients shorter recovery time. 252 ROBOTIC GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY SURGERIES ANNUALL Y BROAD RANGE OF SURGICAL OPTIONS ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER11 ROBOTIC SURGERY aShorter hospitalization aReduced pain and discomfort aFaster recovery time aSmaller incision, lower infection risk aLess blood loss, fewer transfusions aMinimal scarring The da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System delivers a high-resolution, 3-D image of the surgical field, magnified 10 times to the surgeon. With robotic surgical assistance, surgeries have a lower risk associated with them and offer patients a faster return to their normal daily activities.BENEFITS OF ROBOTICS All women are at risk for developing ovarian cancer except those whose ovaries have been removed. As women age, their risk generally increases. Nearly 90 percent of women with ovarian cancer are over the age of 40, with the majority of them being 60 years or older. Beyond age, there are several other known risk factors for ovarian cancer: aA close family member with ovarian cancer aHave had breast, uterine or colorectal cancer aEastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish background aHave never given birth or had trouble getting pregnant aHave endometriosis aTested positive for BRCA1 or B RCA2 genes aTaken estrogen (without progesterone) for 10 or more yearsOVARIAN CANCER A woman's risk for cancer of the uterus generally increases with age. Most uterine cancers are found in women who are going through or have gone through menopause. ENDOMETRIAL CANCER This is the most common form of uterine cancer which forms in the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium. UTERINE SARCOMA This rare form of uterine cancer forms in the muscle or other tissue.UTERINE CANCER ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER12Genitourinary Cancer Our patients feel the benefits of robotic surgery. Genitourinary cancer refers to cancer of the urinary tract and genital region. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men (after skin cancer), and the fourth most prevalent cancer site we treat at St. Peter's Hospital. Here, genitourinary care is led by highly trained, expert urologists who provide patients with the most advanced treatment options available. St. Peter's Hospital is at the forefront of surgical options for the treatment of prostate cancer. Our urologic surgeons were the first in the Capital Region to perform a minimally invasive, laparoscopic prostatectomy in 2002 . Following that success, our surgeons performed the first da Vinci\u00ae robotic prostatectomy at St. Peter's Hospital in 2004. Most recently, the Capital Region's first neobladder creation and surgical implant was performed at St. Peter's Hospital. This complex and life-changing procedure provides patients with a new bladder after muscle- invasive bladder cancer. The minimally invasive, curative procedure replaces the need for an external bag, and allows patients to resume their normal lives after surgery. CANCERS TREATED ADVANCED THERAPIES XOFIGO\u00ae INJECTION FOR ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER Cancer spreads to the bone in 90 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. Xofigo\u00ae is an injection which binds with minerals in the bone to reduce symptoms of metastases.FIRST IN THE NORTHEAST TO OFFER H oLEP St. Peter's Hospital was first in the Northeast to offer Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP), an effective and less invasive alternative to traditional treatments of prostate obstructions.aAdrenal cancer aBladder cancer cancer aUrethral cancer1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. Prostate cancer develops mainly in older men. About 6 out of 10 cases are diagnosed in men age 65 or older. RISK OF PROSTATE CANCER ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER13 A LEADER IN NYS FOR ROBOTIC SURGERIES We perform more robotic surgeries than any other facility in upstate New York. A review of the outcomes of a recent cohort of 140 robotic prostatectomy patients showed that 90 percent of patients went home after an overnight stay, with a low transfusion rate of only 1.4 percent. 147 ROBOTIC GENITOURINARY SURGERIES ANNUALL Y Our surgeons have the ability to perform a minimally invasive surgery with greater visualization, enhanced dexterity, and greater precision through our robotic surgical system. LEADERS IN ROBOTIC SURGERY Robotic surgery offers many advantages to the patient. Complex procedures are safer and more effective with robotic surgical assistance. They have a lower risk associated with them and offer patients a faster return to their normal daily activities. ROBOTIC SURGERY aShorter hospitalization aReduced pain and discomfort aFaster recovery time aSmaller incision, lower infection risk aLess blood loss, fewer transfusions aMinimal scarringBENEFITS OF ROBOTICS SURGICAL OPTIONS ROBOTIC PROSTATE CANCER SURGERY The latest advancements in prostate surgery is robotic prostatectomy. The da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System is so precise that instruments recheck their positions by computer 1,500 times per second. RECONSTRUCTIVE BLADDER SURGERY One of only a few centers in the country to offer orthotopic neobladder, a life- changing, curative surgery. Instead of leaving a patient with a permanent bag, radical cystectomy and neobladder creation creates a new bladder, called an orthotopic neobladder. Using robotics for this surgery results in faster recovery and decreased pain. ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER14Colorectal Cancer We are at the forefront of detection and care. Cancer in the colon and rectum typically begins as small, precancerous growths, or polyps. Over time, these polyps can become cancerous. If left untreated, these curable conditions can become fatal. This is why following recommended screening guidelines has proven to save lives. While not yet a standard treatment at all hospitals, our advanced interventional endoscopists provide endoscopic removal of large polyps, tumors, and even early-stage cancer in the colon and rectum. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy reports endoscopic or surgical removal of early-stage colorectal cancer is extraordinarily effective, and has been proven to offer a 90 percent cure rate. When colorectal cancer has progressed beyond early- stage, a patient's case is thoroughly reviewed by our multidisciplinary tumor board. Working as a team of clinical experts enables our physicians to customize treatment plans to the unique needs of each patient and provide the best possible outcomes. ENDOSCOPIC REMOVAL OF EARLY-STAGE CANCER An incisionless procedure to remove early-stage cancer in the colon or rectum which has not entered the muscle layer, and offers a 90 percent cure rate.THE LEADER IN NYS FOR ADVANCED ENDOSCOPY Our advanced interventional endoscopists perform more procedures than any other hospital in New York state. In the treatment of colorectal cancer, we are one of the first hospitals in New York state to offer endoscopic removal of early-stage colon cancer. At St. Peter's Hospital, endoscopic removal can be performed without incision at the time of diagnosis, and patients can return home the same day. 2,000 ADVANCED ENDOSCOPIES ANNUALL Y COLONOSCOPY SAVES LIVES Colonoscopy has proven to be the most effective colorectal cancer screening method. Studies show it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by nearly 70 percent. EARL Y DETECTION & SCREENING ST.

Liver & Pancreas Cancer We treat a high volume of liver and pancreas cancer. Early-stage cancers of the liver and pancreas often present few to no warning signs, requiring experience and expertise to diagnose. Since 1978, we have been a leader in advanced endoscopic procedures used to diagnose, evaluate and biopsy cancer of the hepatobiliary and endocrine systems. Today, our advanced interventional endoscopists perform more endoscopies than any other hospital in New York state. Surgery, combined with multi-modality therapy, including chemotherapy and radiation, offers the best chance of long-term survival when these cancers are detected early. Among the most challenging and complex surgical procedures, hepatobiliary surgery requires a high degree of expertise and skill. Our board- certified, fellowship-trained hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeons perform more liver and pancreas surgeries than any other surgeons in upstate New York. They offer cutting-edge techniques, utilizing the latest technology and minimally invasive approaches.STATE-OF-THE-ART DIAGNOSTICS & PROCEDURES St. Peter's Hospital was the first in the Capital Region to use SpyGlass Direct Visualization System. Today we perform the highest volume of SpyGlass procedures in our 40-county service area.

PETER'S HOSPITAL CANCER CARE CENTER19 What Can a Cancer Genetic Counselor Do? A family history of cancer does not necessarily indicate a genetic cause and may simply be due to chance or a common environment. A genetic counselor can help determine the level of increased risk. If someone has inherited an increased risk for cancer, their chance of developing cancer may be higher than the general population. Genetic counselors can provide scientific assessment of an individual's cancer risk and accurate information about how to reduce it. Genetic counselors can explain: The biology and genetics of inherited canc er C oncerns about a family history of cancer Canc er risk evaluation What genetic c ounseling entails Genetic counseling for cancer risk assessment at St. Peter's Hospital includes pre-test and post-test counseling, as well as education for patients and families.
