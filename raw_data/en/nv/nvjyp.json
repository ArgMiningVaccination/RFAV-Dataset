The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specifically, PL 111- 148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. The SBMC Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health and quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA s completed in 2013 and 201 6. The 2016 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A . The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus groups with community members . SBMC is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi- facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, in sight and expertise from the Saint Barnabas Medical Center CHNA Oversight Committee helps to identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Service Area The service area is determined by considering three factors: patient origin, market reliance on the Hospital (market share) and geographic continuity and proximity. Zip codes representing approximately 50% of the SBMC patient origin form the initial primary service area (PSA); any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence is also included. Zip codes with low er market share are deleted from the PSA definition and included in the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area and completes the service area determination. SBMC 's PSA is pre dominantly located in t he western half of Essex County. The SSA is comprised of additional Essex County zip codes and sections of Union, Hudson and Morris Counties . For purposes SBMC Primary Service Area ZIP Code ZIP Name 07004 Fairfield 07006 Caldwell ES-2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center of this assessment, Essex County, SBMC 's home county, was selected to best represent the communities served by the Medical Center in reviewing data sources presented at the county level. Essex County encompasses a land mass of 127 square miles comprised of 22 urban and suburban municipalitie s. The county's municipalities are diverse, encompassing large inner -city communities, such as Newark, Irvington, East Orange and Orange in the southeast, and the suburban communities of Livingston, Essex Fells and Roseland to the west. E conomic wealth is not uniformly distributed across municipalities ; urban areas include a high number of poor and minority populations. Saint Barnabas Medical Center ( SBMC ), located in Livingston , is one of seven acute care hospitals operating in Essex County. Livingston is an affluent suburban community with easy access to New York City. Essex County has a larger proportion of African -American and Hispanic/Latino residents than New Jersey.2 o Essex County's population is 3 7.8% African -American, compared to 12.8% statewide. o Essex County's population is 23.5% Hispanic/Latino, compared to 20.7 % statewide . o Essex County's population is 3 0.3% White, compared to 54.4% statewide. In 201 6, 17.2% of people and 14. 0% of Essex County families were living in poverty compared to 10.9% of people and 8.1% of families statewide. o In 201 6, 25.1 % of people and 22.6 % of families were living in poverty in Orange . o In 201 6, 7.2% of people and 5.8 % of families were living in poverty in the West Orange zip code. In 201 6, 8.0% of Essex County reside nts were unemployed, higher than the S tate ( 5.2%). o The unemployment rate in Orange (10.2%) exceeded the county rate ( 8.0%) and was nearly double the S tate rate ( 5.2%). o The Short Hills unemployment rate was 3 .1%, the lowest in the service area and lower than the Essex County rate of 8.0 %. In 201 6, the Essex County median household income was $ 54,860, more than $1 8,000 below the State average.3 o The 201 6 median household income of Orange residents ($3 5,895) was less than half the statewide figure ($ 73,702).4 o Short Hills had the highest median household income in the SBMC Service Area at $250,000. o Between2014 -2016, income levels across the county and the SBMC Service Area showed little increase or decline. TOP FIVE HEALTH ISSUES The SBMC Oversight Committee considered primary and secondary data to determine five top health issues based on capacity, resources, competencies, and needs specific to the populations it serves , with special consideration to impact on underserved communities . These issues are within the hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner: cancer , cardiac care/heart disease , access to care and services, maternal child health and diabetes . 2 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 3 United States Census Bureau 2014 4 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 Page ES-3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 1. Cancer Care Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States, causes approximately 1,600 deaths per day. The disease initiates with unrestrained and abnormal cell growth and spreads via the blood and lymph systems. Cancer is caused by gene mutations that affect how cells grow and divide. Mutations can be inherited or caused by environmental and lifestyle factors. In 2015, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated the cost of cancer in the United States totaled $80.2 billion. There are over 100 different types of cancers, but lung, colorectal, and breast cancers carried the heaviest economic burden. Lung, colorectal, and breast cancers are also responsible for high disability -adjusted life years (DALYs). Prevention, early detection, and treatment o f common cancers yield economic benefits as treating late - stage cancer is more expensive than treating early -stage cancer. Late -stage breast cancer treatment costs three times more than management of early -stage disease. Screening for cervical, breast and colorectal cancers helps detect disease at an early and treatable stage. Vaccines to prevent Hepatitis B (HBV) and HPV are critical to prevention of liver and cervical cancers. Lifestyle -related health behaviors, such as tobacco use, diet, and physical ac tivity can also be modified to reduce risk. The elderly are at greater risk for developing cancer than younger age cohorts. The median age of cancer diagnoses is 66, with persons aged 65 -74 having a 1 in 4 chance of developing the disease. Between 5 - 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects and the remaining 90 -95% attributed to environmental and lifestyle factors. While genetics like age and family history cannot be manipulated, most other major risk factors and lifestyle choices can b e changed. Obesity increases the risk of several cancers; physical activity and nutritious eating can help bring about a healthy weight. One study of severely obese people found significant weight loss reduced risk by one - third. Obesity is associated wit h increased risks for many types of cancer including: breast, colon, endometrial, esophagus, kidney, pancreas, gall bladder, thyroid, ovary, cervix, prostate, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's lymphoma.5 Carcinogens are substances that are responsible for d amaging DNA, promoting and aiding cancer. Tobacco, asbestos, radiation (gamma and x -rays), the sun, and car exhaust fumes are well known carcinogens. The rate of breast cancer is greatly increased when women have excess estrogen levels for a prolonged tim e period. Viruses that weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection (HPV, Hepatitis B and C, Epstein -Barr, HIV) and immunosuppressive drugs are also linked to an increased risk. Between 2013 and 2016, the age- adjusted mortality rate for cancer in Essex County increased from 155.2/100,000 to 160.4/100,000. In 2016, 58.4% of Essex County adults 50+ had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, compared to 65.1% in New Jersey. In 2016, 82.7% of Essex County women 40+ reported having a mammogram s creening within the past 2 years, up 31 percentage points since 2012.6 In 2016, in Essex County, 76.7% of women aged 18 and older had a pap smear test within the last three years, compared to 74.5% in New Jersey. In 2016, 26.8% of Essex County residents were obese, less than 27.3% statewide. 5 Retrieved fr om www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm .

The percent of Essex County smokers in 2016 was higher than the Healthy People 2020 target (12%). In 2018, 15.5% of Essex County residents were seniors over 65 compared to 16.8% statewide. o In 2016, 19.8% of Coldwell residents were 65+, higher than 11.9% in Essex County and the state. SBMC encourages early cancer detection and provides community education outreach programs to that end. The Hospit al offers screenings for breast, cervical, skin, oral, prostate, testicular, and lung cancers. The Lung Cancer Institute at SBMC, in collaboration with the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program, provides free lung cancer screenings for smokers an d former smokers to identify early stage disease. SBMC hosts special events and lecture series provides no -cost workshops regarding diagnosis and treatment. SBMC recognizes that coordination of care, scheduling and Patient Navigator support are imperative to excellent care. The Patient Navigator serves as a liaison between the patient, treating physicians and hospital to provide resources available and assist with making appointments and resolving insurance issues. Patient Navigators seek to ease the process of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Saint Barnabas Medical Centers provides its patients a full array of cancer and ancillary services. The Gynecologic Cancer and Pelvic Surgery Center, the Valerie Fund Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorde rs, The Lung Cancer Institute and the Breast Cancer Center are all recognized Centers of Excellence. Specialized oncology services also available and include radiation oncology, cancer genetics counseling, and integrative medicine (alternative and complem entary) services. 2. Cardiac Care/Heart Disease Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women of most ethnicities, causing 1 in every 4 deaths in the United States. Cardiovascular disease refers to a constellation of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. These conditions are caused by the failure of valves or muscle of the heart and are worsened by blockage of veins and arteries. Some of the most prevalent types of heart disease include: coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, congenital heart diseases, and stroke. Comorbid conditions include: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Each of these conditions contribute to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease by diminishing blood vessel func tion. High blood pressure is usually asymptomatic but damages the heart, kidneys, and brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol can build up in blood vessels, eventually causing fatal blockages. Nearly two -thirds of diabetics die from some form of heart vessel disease. All three comorbidities are preventable and can be contained by changing behavioral risk factors. Coronary heart disease, the most common type of cardiovascular disease, causes more than 370,000 deaths annually.7 In 2014 -2015 the direct and indirect cost of coronary heart disease was $218.7 billion . Heart failure kills more than 177,000 people every year, and also poses a significant economic burden. Older Americans are hospitalized for heart failure more than any oth er age group. As the nation's population skews older in coming decades, the cost of heart failure is projected to triple by 2030. While some risk factors for heart disease (age, family history, male gender, post -menopause, race) cannot be altered, lifesty le changes minimize health conditions associated with heart disease, thereby lowering 7 www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm Page ES-5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center the likelihood of onset. Obesity increases cholesterol, elevates blood pressure levels, and causes diabetes, all of which are comorbid conditions of heart disease. Healt hy eating and exercise can lead to a healthy weight and lower the risk of heart disease. Physical inactivity leads to high blood pressure, high triglyceride levels, low levels of HDL cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity. Regular physical activity can impro ve these measures. Dietary choices can also increase one's risk of heart disease and obesity. Diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and promote atherosclerosis. Diets high in salt content can raise blood pressure lev els. Excessive alcohol use leads to increased blood pressure and higher levels of triglycerides. Cigarette smoking increase the risk of developing heart disease and heart attack by 2 to 4 times by increasing blood pressure and promoting atherosclerosis. Se cond -hand smoke can increase the risk of heart disease to non -smokers as well.8 Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the nation, New Jersey and Essex County. Between 20 13 and 201 6, the Essex County age -adjusted mortality rate for death s due to heart disease decreased 4.3% (to 183.5/100,000) and was lower than statewide but higher surrounding counties. Between 20 14 and 201 6, the percent of Essex County adult residents that reported coronary heart disease increased from 3.5% to 4.5%. The American Heart Association and the World Heart Federation suggest addressing tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity to reduce overall incidence of cardiovascular disease. SBMC is expanding early detection and community education and outreach programs, programming in senior housing and the CHF Transitions program. The CHF Transitions program targets congestive heart failure patients with high risk of readmission. The program educated and engages patients to access post - discharge services to improve medication safety and patient satisfaction, while reducing readmissions. The Heart Center at SBMC has Joint Commission Certification in Heart Failure, Acute Coronary Syndrome, and Cardiac Rehabilitation. 3. Access to Healthcare Costs, culture and edu cation are three main barriers to healthcare access. The Office of Minority Health's \"National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care\" (CLAS), defines full access as care that \"recognizes and responds to health -related beliefs and cultural values, disease incidence and prevalence, and treatment efficacy.\"9 In order to achieve optimal access, effective patient communication is essential. Language differences, diverse cultures, and low health literacy are barriers to high quality care. Linguistic skill, cultural norms and health literacy strategies are integral to ensure a quality patient care plan. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation identified five barriers to healthcare access including: affordability (patients do n ot have enough money to get care), accommodation (patients are too busy to get care), availability (patients could not get an appointment soon enough), accessibility (patients took too long to get to the doctor's office or clinic), and acceptability (docto r or hospital wouldn't accept patient's health insurance).10 SBMC is sensitive to these barriers and strives to ensure patient access to quality care by addressing low health literacy, cultural differences, and limited English proficiency. 8 www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/behavior.htm 9 Office of Minority Health National Standards for Culturally a nd Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/finalreport.pdf 10 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: Barriers to Access http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2012/02/special- issue -of-health -services Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center In 201 6, 13.59 % of Essex County 's 18-64 population was uninsured. This was a higher than the rate statewide (10%).11 In 2016 the median income of Essex County was $54,860, more than $18,000 below the state median of $73,73,702. o In SBMC's service area, Orange had the lowe st median household income ($35,895) In 2016, 15.3% of Essex County residents did not graduate high school, 4.2 percentage points higher than New Jersey.12 o In 2016, 19.9% of Orange residents did not complete high school, nearly double the statewide percentage (11.1%) and higher than Essex County (15.3%). In 2016, the percentage of Limited English Proficiency (LEP) households in Orange (20.2%) was higher than New Jersey ( 12.2%) and Essex County (14.8%). In 2016, 64.2% of Orange's population was African -American, higher than 37.79% in Essex County. o In 2016, 10.2% of the SBMC's service area population are Asian compared to 5.3 % in Essex County and 9.9 % in New Jersey. o In 2016, 27.9% of the Orange's population was Hispanic compared to 12.4% in the SBMC service area. SBMC seeks to improve access through the use of an Emergency Department (ED) navigator. The ED navigator identifies patients without a p rimary care physician, who are at high risk for readmission, and refers them to primary care physicians to ensure smooth progress through the care plan. ED navigators would refer patients to primary care physicians at the Zufall Health Center, the local F QHC, and the Barnabas Health Internal Medicine Faculty Practice, a teaching practice associated with SBMC. Further, a 2014 Accenture study shows that the use of Emergency Department navigators can significantly reduce departmental overuse and hospital readmissions. 4. Maternal/Child Health Child and Maternal health care are leading indicators of the health of future generations. The focus of maternal and child health are issues affecting women, children and their families. It seek s to provide education, a dvocacy, and research for reproductive health and child safety. Professionals dedicated to this area of public health address access to sexual reproduction health services and advise in family planning, promote the health of pregnant women and their child ren and increase vaccination rates. The research they provide improves the education, and implementation of health delivery systems at local, state, national, and multi- national levels . On a multi -national scale, the World Health Organization, has pushed for a Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health. Implementing Every Woman Every Child (EWEC) Global Strategy , an ongoing strategy encompassing several H6 agencies dealing with population health. Their set of objectives are to end pr eventable deaths, ensure health and well -being, and expand enabling environments. This plan has sparked a global movement; counties and government organizations on a national and state level around the world have taken steps to help the women and children of today lead healthy lives. For example, New Jersey had implemented a similar plan called Healthy Women Healthy Families, combating the same issues effecting women and children. The health and wellness of today's 11 Enroll America Changing Uninsured Rates by County - From 2013 to 2015 https://www.enrollamerica.org/research -maps/maps/changes- in- uninsured- rates -by-county/ 12 Unite d States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2016 Page ES-7 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center women and children can help predict fut ure public health challenges for families, communities, and the health care system. Pregnancy can provide a n opportunity to identify health risks in women and to prevent future health problems for women and their children. These health risks include: Hypertension and heart disease Diabetes Depression Intimate partner violence Genetic conditions Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Tobacco, alcohol, and substance use Inadequate nutrition Unhealthy weight These risks can be incrementally lowered with increasing access to quality preconception, prenatal, and inter -conceptional care. Early detection and treatment of possible illness or disability also play a huge role in healthy birth outcomes and decrease preventable deaths. Infant and child health is sues are influenced by behavioral factors, su ch as education, income and breast feeding, but are also linked to the physical and mental health of parents and caregivers. There are racial and ethnic disparities in mortality for mothers and children; African Americans families have the highest rate of morality. These differences are all the result of multiple factors. Essex County's overall infant mortality decreased from 7.8/1000 in 2007 -2008 , to 6.6/1000 in 2013- 2015. o Essex County infant mortality rate has been historically higher than the St ate. o While the state has remained constant around 5 deaths per 1,000 from 2007 to 2015, Essex County has ranged from 5.2 to 6.6 deaths per 1,000 fr om 2007 to 2015. Infant mortality for African Americans in Essex County from 2013 to 2015 was 9.6 deaths in 1,000 people, which decreased from 12.3 deaths per 1,000 from 2007 to 2009. Essex County in 2013 the percentage of live births with no prenatal care was 1.9% which increased to 3.3% in 2016. o In 2010, 80.9% of liv e births to Essex County moms received first trimester prenatal care which decreased to 63.5% in 2016. While the rate of infant deaths has remained constant over the past 5 years , Black infant deaths have been on the decline, but the dispiriting factor is that the rate is still nearly double of that of all other races and ethnicities. Many factors play into this, one of them being poverty levels, Essex County has a higher poverty rate compared to the S tate and the SBMC Service Area for both individuals and families in 2016. This number get inflated due to Orange (07050) and West Orange (07052) which experience high er levels of poverty compared to neighboring cities , and have the most racially diverse populations in the SBMC Service Area. While neighbo ring cities Caldwell (07006), Livingston (07039), and Short Hills (07078) poverty rates don't Page ES-8 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center exceed 4%. Orange has a poverty level of 24.5% for individuals and a 22.7% for families, nearly double both New Jerseys poverty rate (10.9%, 8.1% respectively), and Essex County (17.2%, 14.0% respectively). Median household income is another factor that plays into child and maternal health. Essex County has a median household income of $58,264 in 2018, nearly $20,000 less than the State at $78,317. Essex County has a wide range of income with the top 1% earning a median household income of $307,347 and the bottom earning $38,057. SBMC offers moms and moms to be modern state -of-the-art maternity facilities and technology with highly skilled physician s and nursin g staff. The approach to care is family centered and staff are dedicated to providing patients with support, education and the highest quality health care services. The medical center provides childbirth preparation classes and breast feeding support ser vices and classes for siblings. The Department of Pediatrics at St. Barnabas Medical Center offers inpatient and outpatient subspecialty care in the following Specialties : Allergy Cardiology Child Development Emergency Medicine Gastroenterology Immunology' Infectious disease Intensive Care Neurology Pulmonology Rheumatology , orthopedics , otolaryngology, plastic surgery, transplant and urology. 5. Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood glucose levels are too high due to abnormal levels of the hormone insulin. In T ype 1 diabetes , the body is not able to make insulin. In T ype 2 diabetes , the more common type, the body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in your blood. Over time, too much glucose in the blood can cause serious problems , damaging the eyes , kidneys , and nerves . Diabetes can also cause heart disease , stroke and even the need to remove a l imb. Pregnant women can get gestational diabetes . The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 18 million people suffer from diabetes . Prediabetes is a precursor to diabetes in which blood sugar is higher than normal, but not high enough to be diabetes. Having prediabetes puts an individual at a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a major risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes. This form of diabetes, once believed to affect only adults, is now diagnosed in children. Between 1980 and 2000, obesity rates doubled among children and adults and tripled among adolescents.13 Overweight children with diabetes are at risk for serious complications including kidney 13www.cdc.gov/pdf/facts_about_obesity_in_the_united_states.pdf Page ES-9 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center disease, blindness, and amputations. Other risk factors related to obesity include unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure. While many diabetes risk factors are modifiable, other factors including a family history, increasing age, and ethnicit y are uncontrollable. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in Essex County. The 201 6 age-adjusted mortality rate due to diabetes ( 28.4 /100,000) is 13% higher than in 2013. o In Essex County, Whites (282.6/100,000) had the highest age -adjusted death rate for diabetes. o In 2016, Essex County had the highest percent of patients reporting diabetes among comparison counties. In 201 6, 26.8% of Essex County residents were obese, less than the 27.3 % statewide and a decrease from 29.5 % in 20 12.14 In 201 6, 29.8 % of people engaged in no physical exercise in New Jersey, a n increase from 2 3.3% in 20 14.15 In 201 6, 32.6% of Essex County adults reported no physical exercise within the past month, higher than New Jersey ( 29.8%) and CHR national benchmark (2 3%) and a n increase from 26.9% in 20 14. SBMC offers several diabetes care programs to provide patients access to care, education and the resources they need to manage their disease. These include education on blood sugar monitoring devices, meal planning, medication management, diet and nutritional education, hypertension and cholesterol monitoring, stress and exercise management, and diabetes education and management during pregnancy. 14 New Jersey State Health Assessment Data 201 4 15 Behavio ral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2016 Page 1 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 1. INTRODUCTION SBMC Service Area The Saint Barnabas Medical Center ( SBMC ) Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is designed to ensure that the Medical Center continues to effectively and efficiently serve the health needs of its service area. The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specifically, PL 111 - 148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. The SBMC Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health and quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA completed in 201 6. The 201 6 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A . The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus groups with other community stakeholders. SBMC is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi- facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, in sight and expertise from the Saint Barnabas Medical Center CHNA Oversight Committee helps t o identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Saint Barnabas Medical Center, located in Livingston , New Jersey, is one of seven acute care hospitals operat ing in Essex County. SBMC 's primary service area comprises largely urban and suburban communities located in wes tern Essex County. The SBMC Oversight Committee determined five issues to be within the hospital's purview, competency and resources to impac t in a meaningful manner: Cancer, Cardiac Care/Heart Disease, Access to Healthcare, Maternal/Child Health, and Prevention/Screening s and Vaccine s. Cancer mortality, the second leading cause of death in Essex County and New Jersey, can be reduced by prevention, early detection, and treatment. SBMC encourages early cancer detection and provides community education outreach programs. Cardiovascular dis ease is the leading cause of death in the nation, state, and county. Addressing lifestyle -related risk factors for cardiovascular disease lowers mortality rates. The Heart Center at SBMC has Joint Commission Certification in Heart Failure, Acute Coronary S yndrome, and Cardiac Rehabilitation. Access to health care includes affordability, accommodation, availability, and accessibility. Maternal and child health care are leading indicators of the health of future generations. Page 2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Clinical preventive services occupy an important position within the realm of interventions to prevent, forestall or mitigate illness. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels , from various sources including Department of Health and H uman Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Census Bureau, Healthy People 2020 , the County Health Rankings, and hospital discharge data, to name a few. Healthy People 2020 is a 10 -year agenda to improve the nation's health that encompasses the entire continuum of prevention and care. For over three decades Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time to measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy People 2020 benchmarks are used throughout the report to assess the health status of residents. The County Health Rankings, published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, rank the health of nearly all counties in the United States. The rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking, etc. These rankings are also used throughout the report to measure the overall health of Essex County residents. County rates are also compared to statewide rates. The SBMC needs assessment was developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout the community. To this end, both internal and external data were used to understand rece nt health indicators and opportunities to provide a positive impact on health and wellness. Other significant needs determined by this CHNA include: Prevention/Screenings and Vaccines Opioid Addiction LGBTQ IA Mental Health Page 3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 2. METHODOLOGY/SERVICE AREA A. METHODOLOGY Saint Barnabas Medical Center ( SBMC ) developed an evidenced -based process to determine the health needs of Essex County residents. CHNA data sources include both primary and secondary data to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the communities. Data from these sources were reviewed by the Steer ing Committee to identify and prioritize the top issues facing residents in the service area (see Top Health Issues section). The flow chart below identifies the CHNA and implementation planning process employed. Prioritization Process Following the Steering Committee's review of quantitative and qualitative data on 12/11/18, a list of issues were identified by consultants as common themes of the research. Through discussion, this list was expanded to 11. These issues became the suggested priority issues and included: Mental Health and Substance Abuse Overweight and Obesity, Nutrition Access to Care/ Services Prevention Service/Screening s/Vaccines Cardiac Care/Heart Disease Diabetes Maternal Child Health CHNA and IMPLEMENTATION PLAN PROCESS 3CommunityDevelopment of Data & Internal Oversight Committee Review of Secondary Source Data Primary Research Priority Setting and Plan DevelopmentCommunication Plan - All ConstituentsImplementationEvaluation Page 4 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Financial Disparities LGBTQ IA Smoking/Vaping Prevention Education A ballot was developed, and a survey sent to the oversight committee asking them to rank each issue based on the following criteria. Number of people impacted Risk of mortality and morbidity associated with the problem Impact of the problem on vulnerable populations Meaningful progress can be made within a three -year timeframe Community's capability and competency to impact A tally of the 4 1 ballots cast resulted in the following eight issues to be ranked highest overa ll. Mental Health & Substance Abuse Overweight/Obesity/ Nutrition Prevention Service/Screening s/Vaccines Cardiac Care/Heart Disease Diabetes Maternal Child Health Cancer Access to Care & Services Access to Transportation Many of the hospital/affiliate organizations including the Be havioral Health Network and the institute for Prevention and Recovery are currently working in Behavioral Health and Substance U se disorders. Prevention and treatment services incorporate nutrition, obesity reduction plans as well as diabetes prevention. As a result, the M edical Center has chosen to work on the five remaining health issues. Cardiac Care/Health Disease Access to Care and Services Maternal Child Health Diabetes Primary Data Sources Community Health Needs Surveys In order to obtain a service area- specific analysis for the SBMC service area, on -line survey Interviews were conducted among 738 residents of the Hospital's PSA. Interviews were conducted online and by telephone. A link to the online survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media sites. Additionally, postcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directing residents to the online survey link. A telephone augment was conducted to capture additional interviews in specific areas and among specific ethnic groups. For the telephone portion, a representative sample of households was generated from a database of residential telephone numbers. Bruno and Ridgway Research Associates, Page 5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Inc. administered the on -line and telephone surveys from June 7 - September 27, 2018. Survey results are incorporated into this CHNA. (See Section 3) Focus Group Discussions Two focus groups were undertaken to uncover additional information from key community groups and individuals with respect to health needs, challenges and barriers, and suggestions for improving access to health care services. Focus Group Report is found in Se ction 4. (See Section 4 . Focus group meetings were conducted in February and March 201 9.) Secondary Data Sources Over 100 secondary data sources are compiled in this CHNA, presenting data by indicator by county and state. Sources include: The United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). See Appendix B for a detailed list of sources. Appendix C contains a detailed report o f cancer incidence and mortality by cancer site for Essex County for the years 2010 -2017. In addition, hospital tumor registry data is utilized to understand stage of cancer at time of diagnosis. Health Profile Section 5 provides a comprehensive pres entation of health outcomes as well as the social determinants of health and other health factors that contribute to the health and well- being of Essex County residents. Color Indicator Tables Throughout the Health Profile Section of this CHNA, the color indicator tables compare county level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, County Health Rankings benchmarks, and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity are compared to data for all race s in the county, unless otherwise indicated. Essex County was the midpoint value compared to a range 20% higher than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020, or County Health Rankings Benchmarks, or 20% lower than the value for New Jersey, Healthy P eople 2020, or County Health Rankings Benchmarks. If the county value was within the range 20% lower or 20% higher than the comparison indicator, or considered within reasonable range, the indicator will be yellow. The table will be red if the Essex County value is more than 20% worse or lower than the indicator value. If the Essex County value is 20% better or higher than the indicator value, the table will be green. Comparative counties are also presented providing additional context for select health ind icators. Assets and Gaps Section 6, Assets and Gaps, summarizes the preceding components of the CHNA. Assets highlight county information indicating improvement over time, in comparison to other counties and the State, or in comparison to other races or genders. Gaps focus on disparities in Essex County or the SBMC Service Area that have a negative trend, in comparison to other counties in the State or to other races or genders. Page 6 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Resource Inventory A service area- specific resource inventory is included as Appendix D, which details health and social service resources available to residents in Essex County. Providers' names, addresses, and phone numbers and type of services provided are contained in the inventory. B. SERVICE AREA Saint Barnabas Medical Center is located in Livingston , New Jersey. It is one of seven hospitals serving residents in Essex County. The Medical Center 's primary service area (PSA) consists of the following zip codes: SBMC Service Area Map The service area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, market reliance on the Hospital (market share) and geographic continuity/ proximity. Typically, the combined service area represents 75 -80% of the Medical Center's patients. Zips codes represe nting approximately 50% of the SBMC patient origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Medical Center has a high market share presence , any zip code with low er market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes part of the secondary service area (SSA) . The next range of zip codes comprise the SSA. Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. SBMC 's PSA is pred ominantly located in t he western portion of Essex County. The SSA is comprised of a number of Essex County zip codes and portions of Hudson and Morris Counties . For purposes of this assessment, Essex County, SBMC 's home county, was selected to best repres ent communities served by the Medical Center in reviewing data sources presented at the county level. SBMC Primary Service Area ZIP Code ZIP Name 07004 Fairfield 07006 Caldwell 07932 Florham Park 07936 East Hanover Page 7 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Most of the secondary data in this report is based on county level data. Cit y or zip code level data is provided wherever possible to enhance the understanding of the specific needs of service area residents. Data obtained from the qualitative analys es provide further insight into health issues facing the communities served by th e Medical Center.

FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS A. ORANGE RESIDENTS FOCUS GROUP Following presentation of the data on December 11, 2018, the Steering Committee determined that there were two groups they felt were not adequately represented. These included Hispanic/Latinos and male residents from Orange. Members of the SBMC team organized the two focus groups which were held in February and March 2019. Due to the difficulty of finding a sufficient number of men to participate, it was decided to hold the group in Orange and discuss issued of men's health. Participants were community leaders, representatives of organizations serving the community, government representatives and interested citizens. Areas discussed included most pressing health issues, barriers to the receipt of care, men's health and healthy lifestyles, behavioral health issues, and healthy community. Overall Findings Orange residents were concerned about both a lack of health services since the hospital closed and the lack of knowledge about what services are available. Orange residents do not fe el the community is safe and healthy and believe there is a lack of support to assist residents to lead a healthy li fe. Most feel having a referral center to hel p residents find needed services and navigate through the system would be most beneficial. Most Pressing Health Issues Orange residents talked about the lack of services in their community and their desire to have someone (preferably Saint Barnabas) open a Health Center at the old Orange Memorial Hospital site . Participants also discussed the need for information about where to obtain health information, preventative services and health care services. Obesity and its co -morbidities were also mentioned as problems faced by both children and adults. \"I know Saint Barnabas does a lot of collaborating . . . and they have satellites and I would love to see Saint Barnabas be able to come to the forefront and do some thing with that property.\" (Orange Memorial Hospital) \"I find you just don't get mailings or anything about what's happening in Orange, for Seniors.\" \"I was very active before but now find I have diabetes, when that happened, I looked around, and there was nothing . . . then I heard about Rutgers and their outpatient department. So, the first class was for six weeks and was free. You go down, you have snacks and stuff, and you get really great instruction.\" \"I feel like either more communication or a place like a center, where things can be gotten, not only at the health department . . . it's not engaging. \" \"I noticed with our children, they don't really get enough physical exercise . . . What I am noticing is that there's a large percent of obese childre n . . . so if we had a place where they could get more activity, get more nutritious meals and things like that, then we can intervene in what's going on before it escalates to something out of control and health costs are incurred and then disabilities.\" Page 53 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Residents felt that services were insufficient to meet the community's needs and that services that were available were not well publicized or communicated to the general community. \"If you don't live in a senior building, you don't get it.\" (mailings) \"We need more money coming in for these kinds of things.\" \"There's no communication, especially for those of us who live independently. And most seniors do live independently . . . and like she said, it's a dreary place (Orange Health Department) - It is sad. In terms of communication, in terms of facilities, in terms of what's available. And we really, I don't know if it's possible to have a collaboration with East Orange, but we really have to start from square one in terms of trying to catch up. They have classes.\" \"I know technology is great . . . but I think if and when things get situated and together, you'd have to do mailings and everything. A lot of seniors are not going to Facebook, Instragram and all of those other kinds of programs.\" Barriers In addition to communication, residents felt that transportation and language were barriers to receiving services, and health education and information. \"Transportation and communication. Even though we are small . . . most of the things are away from Orange so to realize there was a place, like a center or something that everything could come to, people could come to get a shot, or get blood tested, a wellness check . . . that would be nice.\" \"There are so many language barriers.\" Men's Health Issues The group felt that most men avoided the health care system out of fear; and as a result of cultural mores. \"Oh fear, fear, fear.\" \"Probably fear; I mean I noticed they wait till the last minute and then the doctor will come in and say, sorry.\" \"There are cultural norms you're struggling against; men don't ask for directions.\" \"So many different cultures here and they'll say don't say anything about that. No, you don't need to do that. Oh, you'll be fine.\" Healthy Community Respondents do not consider their community to be healthy or safe. Their concerns ranged from issues of crime, violence and homeless, to environmental concerns of air and water quality, and a lack of services. \"If you are considering safety to be part of health; then not at all. Because, you know there's always something going on in the City with crime.\" \"But if you don't' feel safe in going out or just walking in the street to get exercise, that you don't' have to pay for, you know, you don't feel safe.\" \"Plus, the fact that we no longer have a hospital. It certainly takes away from our health.\" \"We do have homeless roaming the streets.\" \"Our water is very hard. The minerals form all around the sink . . . the build up and I'm like we've been drinking this stuff. So, we don't know what effect that's having.\" \"A lot of our homes in Orange are old, also.\" \"It depends on what section you live in, relevant to the stability of your neighborhood. Page 54 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Awareness of the Importance of Healthy Lifestyle Participants believe most people are aware of living a healthy lifestyle but feel that Orange does not support as many resources for helping people engage in these practices compared to other nearby towns. \"I think people are aware, but in terms of the facilities that are available to us , it goes back to what we talked about earlier, we don't compare. Like with East Orange - they have a facility where they have all kinds of classes with Seniors and things going on in terms of nutrition.\" \"It would be nice if we could do more with the Y.\" Mental Health Respondents were most concerned about developmental service s for children, trauma and its impact on young people . The number of homeless men was also mentioned as indicative of the behavioral health issues in the community, Residents felt there were little to no services available to deal with these issues. \"I don't think there are enough services or resources for our children when it comes to milestone development, dealing with trauma, or looking at the things that trauma induces . . . T he parents are dealing with trauma that hasn't been addressed so they can't help their children with it.\" \"In our school system, if you got 24 or 25 kids in your class . . . so, 6 out of those 24 have some type of issue that's not being addressed, and it hurts them as far as learning.\" \"A large portion of our kids have free lunch or reduced lunch which means there is an issue of finances and you know other things go along with that.\" \"I have 700 kids and 1 guidance counselor. This is something that needs to be addressed.\" \"If statistics from other communities were applied to Orange, 30 -50% of children are suffering from trauma. Yeah, 67% of adults are suffering some degree of trauma, which is probably not being addressed.\" B. HISPANIC FOCUS GROUP Overa ll Findings Hispanics are most concerned about accessing health services due to undocumented status, lack of insurance and the price of prescription drugs. Language, transportation and legal status were among the most critical barriers to obtaining care. Respondents would like to see a formal referral center to help residents obtain care as informal networks were stretched thin. Behavioral health issues are under -addressed due to stigma. Most Pressing Health Issues Many of the issues on participants' min ds regarding their most pressing concerns have to do with accessing services. Respondents discussed legal barriers faced by undocumented individuals, lack of insurance and the high cost of prescription drugs, combined with a lack of information about available resources as key areas of concern. \". . . the high price of prescriptions is a big issue because those who earn minimum wage, they can't afford prescriptions.\" Page 55 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center \". . . they don't have insurance and they want a check -up and they can't get it . . . and these are hard working people in the community.\" \". . . if they don't have insurance, it costs them a lot of money.\" \"The local hospitals, especially SBMC, does a lot already, but some people just don't go anywhere, they just hold off.\" \"I think there is a lack of information, possibly due to a language barrier. The patient may not even know that the hospital can work out a payment plan or something to help them get the medical attention they need. So, they're not going to seek it.\" Participants suggeste d that the best way to reach the Hispanic community was through the West Orange Hispanic Foundation and Trinity Church, both of which are trusted entities . The community frequently seeks help from these organizations or people associated with them. Participants believe that having a community referral service to help residents, especially those with low English literacy navigate through the system would be particularly effective. \"In Newark they have _________, and I know from many experiences that people who may not speak the language go there and can get referrals for just about anything. A lot of it is medical needs. I don't believe we have anything like that in West Orange . . . That might just be a starting point for a person seeking information, j ust to be able to go to an office and have them see if they qualify for some sort of insurance.\" \"We are referring a lot of people to Orange and Newark for these types of services but then transportation becomes an issue. It would just be nice to have a C enter similar to the one in Newark here in the neighborhood. Participants talked about how the rapid influx of Hispanics into the West Orange community had perhaps overwhelmed the town's resources, especially its health care resources because it was unacc ustomed to providing services to a low income population. Many people work with the West Orange Hispanic Foundation, as volunteers trying to answer inquires but for many this is in addition to working at full- time jobs. \"These things make me question why isn't this in West Orange, even though West Orange may have resources, why aren't they implemented towards health care?\" \"I understand most of West Orange is considered middle class and they would resist building a community service like that because they would be afraid to draw a different type of community. That's a barrier that needs to be addressed by the town, that we are growing as a low income area. . . .\" Access Health to Care Services Residents seeking medical service s rely on physicians in East Orange or Paterson who will accept low cash payments, or they go to University Hospital. A significant issue for parents is getting their children physicals and shots so they can enter school. Other services that are difficult to access are bilingual providers and behavioral health services. \"There is a place in East Orange that provides low income -based services to families; and I think they charge $60 for a consultation including shots.\" \"I don't think we have a Center to address alcohol and drug issues.\" \"I think in my personal experience, 'I like a doctor who is bilingual and bicultural also, and I have not been able to find that in West Orange or in the vicinity.\" Page 56 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Language, transportation and legal status were among the most critical barriers d iscussed by respondents. \"We started to bring a cop to our meetings (West Orange Hispanic Foundation) so that they could be less afraid of the police.\" \"It's not easy to get transportation and it's not cheap either. . . . I have to go all the way to Passaic to the dentist; to East Orange for medical check -ups and the hours they are open 6AM to 11AM, as it impacts school and work.\" \"I think we can do better with bilingual services.\" Perception of the Community is Safe and Healthy Many have lived here most of their lives and find it a good place to raise children and feel safe in the community. \"It is a safe, beautiful town and we are proud if it; we love our town. My wife and I have lived here about 30 years; and we love our town, and, this is why we . . . work for our community.\" \"The schools are great --- playground; some people have concerns and all that. But we feel we are great.\" \"My grandson said the playground in West Orange is the best.\" Mental Health and Substance Abuse Many felt that behavioral health problems go unaddressed because of the stigma associated with these issues in the Hispanic community. For Hispanics, behavioral health issues are seen as a weakness and, therefore, this group will not seek care for themselves or family members. \"In terms of mental health, I think they might be needed for teenagers because I hear when they start to have conflicts at home parents don't know what to do - do they go to the police - what do they do?\" \"I would guess 8 -9% of the children are having emotional problems. It's very sad and ongoing dilemma for teenagers.\" \"We had meeting about suicide at Roosevelt where they had specialists come; they had a program for kids during the day and parents at night - something like that might be helpful.\" For the most part, residents felt having a clinic in their community where people didn't have to travel by bus or driving would go a long way in improving access to care for the community. \"I don't know the exact number, but the number of undocumented in the area is big. A community clinic would be a great thing; despite any legalities our community is a hard- working community, and they get a job right away but going to a big hospital is a big difference.\" \"Essentially we have to provide services but more imp ortantly get the information out that these services are available.\" \"I think if we can get good contacts, even if they are not local, at least we have good information to give people.\" Page 57 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 4. ESSEX COUNTY /SERVICE AREA HEALTH PROFILE The Essex County Hea lth Profile provides a discussion of health outcomes and factors , including social determinants of health, that are used in determining health status. Essex County data are compared to local, State and national measures. A. ESSEX COUNTY OVERVIEW Essex County is located in the center of the northeast section of New Jersey. The county encompasses a land mass of 127 square miles with 22 urban and suburban municipalities. Essex County's municipalities are diverse and include large inner- city communiti es, such as Newark, Irvington, East Orange and Orange in the southeast, as well as the suburban communities of Livingston, Essex Fells and Roseland in the west. To the north and west lie suburban towns with shopping malls, industrial and professional offic e parks, luxury condominiums and townhouses, and private homes. Newark, the county's largest city, is also home to a cultural center, a sports and entertainment complex, a number of colleges and universities, and headquarter s a number of corporate giants. Newark is a major national transportation hub. Essex County includes: Belleville, Bloomfield, Caldwell, Cedar Grove, East Orange, Essex Fells, Fairfield, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Livingston, Roseland, South Orange, Verona, West Caldwell, and West Orange. In 1865, Essex County was the first U.S. county to create a county -wide park system, the Essex County Parks Commission acquired 60 acres of land from the City of Newark as the beginnin g of Branch Brook Park. Today those 60 acres have grown into 5,745 acres of green space that include reservations, developed parks, golf courses, tennis courts, ice and roller skating complexes, and a zoo. Essex County is the second most densely populated county in New Jersey and has the third highest number of residents . Between 2010 and 201 8, Essex County's population increased 2.0%. The migration of people in and out of the urban areas of Essex County has changed significantly. After consistent popula tion declines over the last half- century, urban areas in the southern and eastern parts of the county have seen population increases in the past five years. The demographic trends in Essex County are a part of larger changes throughout the S tate and countr y. The northeastern part of the state shows the highest growth, with younger couples gravitating toward communitie s that have walkable downtowns and accessible mass transit to cities . Suburb an and rural parts of the state t o the west and south are losing residen ts as they retire and leave the sta te in search of lower taxes and living costs. Page 58 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center B. SBMC SERVICE AREA Between 2010 and 201 8, the population of the SBMC Service Area grew at a slower rate (1.96%) than Essex County (2.0%) and New Jersey (2.0%). In 2023, the Service Area population is expected to grow by 1.32% to 363,446.

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Social determinants of health include socioeconomic and environmental factors which influence health outcomes, disparities in health, equity in health care, and are important tools to assess health at the local level. Healthy People 2020 provides a framew ork for assessing social determinants of health across five topic areas: economic stability; education; social and community context; health and health care; and, neighborhood and built environment. While a relatively affluent county, there are residents of Essex County and SBMC Service Area that face many socioeconomic challenges that may have consequences for health and health care in the region.16 16 https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/social- determinants- Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 1. Socioeconomic Status Socioeconomic status is the aggregate of several social, economic, and demographic measures. In this analysis, these measures include: h ousehold Income and p overty, unemployment, education, ethnic and racial makeup, age, and Divinity Health's Health Need Index by service area. According to Healthy People 2020, socioeconomic factors contribute to disparities in disease incidence and mortality among racial, ethnic and underserved groups. Studies indicate that income and socio economic status (SES) is a better predictor of the likelihood of an individual's or group's access to education, health insurance, and safe and healthy living and working conditions than race or ethnicity. SES also impacts the prevalence of behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol use) and rates of preventive screenings (lower SES, fewer screenings). Income, Poverty, and Unemployment Income influences the way people invest in their health and provides options for healthy lifestyle choices . In low income circumstances, preventive care expenses are more often neglected in favor of immediate living expenses. The longer people live in poverty, the more abject their income disadvantage and the more likely they are to suffer from a range of health problems. Circumstances that lead to poverty also may lead to social exclusion, discrimination, racism, stigmatization, and unemployment. Thus, the following measures of income and poverty may be evidence of these problems. Unemployment puts health at risk, starting when people first feel their jobs are threatened, before they become unemployed. Job insecurity increases mental health issues, p articularly anxiety and depression. Populations with higher unemployment rates have collective increased risk of premature death. Those who are unemployed face greater challenges to health and well- being, including lost income and health insurance. Unemployed individuals are 54% more likely to be in poor or fair health as compared to employed individuals. Accord ing to CHR, racial and ethnic minorities and those with less education, often already at -risk for poor health outcomes, are most likely to be unemployed. Labor statistics indicate unemployment rates peaked at the height of the recession in 2010 and began t o show some improvement beginning in 2014. Most areas of the State have shown continued improvement. Essex County Although Essex County has affluent areas, pockets of poverty in Newark, East Orange , Orange and Irvington exist.

To ascertain the number of households that may be struggling due to the high cost of living in New Jersey we turned to the United Way's ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed project)23 to get a better idea of the number of households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level but less than the basic cost of living in Essex County.

Education People with higher levels of educational attainment tend to have lower morbidity rates from acute and chronic diseases, independent of demographic and labor market factors. Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, yet differences have become more pronounced between those with and without a college education. The mechanisms by which education influences health are complex and likely include interrelationships between demographic and family background indicators, effects of poor health in childhood, greater resources associated with higher levels of education, a learned appreciation for the importance of good health behaviors, and one's social networks.27 The ability to communicate in English is also a key part of educatio nal competence. The lack of English proficiency can negatively impact one's ability to understand and follow medical directions. Essex County residents experienced a decrease in the percentage of the population over age 5 with limited English proficiency .

Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.32 32 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach/health 8.47 2013 2014 2015RATE PER 10,000New Jersey Essex County Middlesex County Union County Indicator Healthy People 2020 Target County Health Rankings Benchmark New Jersey Membership Organizations N.A. National Benchmark: 22.1 Essex County 201 5: 8.2 Page 78 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Health Insurance The expansion of Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions , which began taking effect in 2010, helped decrease the nation's uninsured rate by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent in 2016 . That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 compared to 2010. The uninsured rate is estimated to have inc reased to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018, meaning another 4 million lost coverage since 2016 due to changes in health policy and insurance offerings. The uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care, dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without insurance are often diagnosed at later, less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer providers, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely access to care for patients and financial burdens to the providers who care for them. Since 2013, the non -elderly population without health insuranc e in Essex County has trended downward, decreasing from 18.5 % in 2013 to 13.6% in 2015. From 2013 through 2015, Essex County had consistently higher rates of non -elderly population without health insurance than statewide . In 201 5, Essex County ( 13.6%) was higher than the ambitious Healthy People 2020 target of no person without health coverage .

Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, sp ecialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. Access to care goes beyond just insurance, it is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.33 Primary Care Physicians Nationally, many areas lack sufficient providers to meet patient needs; as of June 2014, there are about 7,200 primary care, 5,000 mental health and 5,900 dental federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas in the US. Having a usual primary care provider is associated with a higher likelihood of appropriate care and better outcomes. In 2017, 88% of Americans had a usual source of care, but those with low incomes are less likely to than those with higher incomes, and the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to lack a usual care source.34,35 Between 2013 and 2015, the ratio of population to physicians in Essex County increased from 1,196:1 to 1,217:1. In 201 5, the Essex County rat io for primary care providers was better than the CHR national benchmark (1,030:1) .

Based on a wide array of demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Code with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI is useful as part of a larger community health needs assessment to pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an average of five barrier scores that measure socio -econ omic indicators of each community using 2017 source data. The five barriers are: 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 36 Truven Health Analytics, 2017; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2017; Claritas, Community 2017.

Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilization. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for manageable conditions. Communities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healthy community structures and appropriate outpatien t and primary care.

Young children can be exposed by swallowing lead dust or soil that gets on their hands or objects they put into their mouths such as toys; swallowing leaded paint chips; breathing leaded dust or lead contamina ted air and eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with lead. Very high levels of lead can cause seizures, brain damage, developmental or intellectual disabilities, coma and even death. Exposure to lead, even at low levels, has been associated with decrease hearing, lower intelligence, hyperactivity, attention deficit, and developmental problems.41 County level analysis cannot reveal individual town disparities in blood lead levels particularly in towns with housing stock built before 1950.

Clinical Care Measures Inpatient and ED Utilization44 Factors impacting hospital utilization may include policy change, advances in technology, practice patterns and demographics. Many federal and state health care payment reforms, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were designed to improve care transi tions, coordination of care, enhance ambulatory care and improve access to primary care. The anticipatory result would include improved coordinated care and declines in inpatient and ED utilization.

Health Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks, then every two or three weeks from weeks 28 -36, and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy requires additional visits.47 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increas ed possibility of adverse outcomes. Early and regular prenatal care is a strategy to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. Two significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortality rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care.48 In 2016, only 63.5% of Essex County women entered prenatal care in the first trimester compared to 72.1% in New Jersey. As compared to other New Jersey counties, Essex County ranks in the lowest quartile. Essex County women enrolled in first trimester prenatal care declined from 8 1% in 201 0 to 63.5% in 2016. 47 http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health- info/pregnancy/prenatal- care 48 http://www.hrsa.gov/quality/toolbox/measures/prenatalfirsttrimester/in dex.html Page 106 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Percentage of Live Births with First Trimester Prenatal Care State & County Comparisons 2014 -2016 Essex County Source: NJDOH Bureau of Vital Statistics and Registration NJ Birth Certificate Database Note: Percentages are based on Total Number of Live Births for County 77.8%80.9%71.1%65.3%63.5% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center The percent of Essex County women without prenatal care ranged from a low of 1.9% in 2013 , to a high of 3.3% in 2016. The 2016 Essex County rate for no prenatal care was more than double the State rate of 1 .6% and performed in the lowest quartile. Increases such as these are concerning and should be monitored. Information obtained from the local maternal and child health consortium suggests that fear of deportation, time/cost consider ation s, and the fact that some women believe care in the first trimester is less a need (pregnancy is normal) as some of the reasons for this decline.

Smoking leads to disease and disability, and harms nearly every organ in the body, and causes cancer , heart disease, stroke, diabetes , and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis, a nd chronic airway obstruction . Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 4 1,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmoke rs. About 1 5% of U.S. adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke their first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also lead s to various cancer s, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine addiction . Almost 6% of young adults use smokeless tobacco and half of new users are younger than 18.53,54 NJBRFS did not separate out use of nicotine vaping devices in the question regarding smoking. We are aware through information obtained from primary research conducted for this CHNA, that a majority of adolescents and young adults are choosing vaping products over the use of cigarettes and that some adolescents may not even be aware of the fact that vaping devices are just another form of nicotine delivery. Vaping among adolescents has been a major concern of community stakeholders and current news articles and reports of deaths and lung disease associated with vaping has become a major issue of concern. Between 201 4 and 2016, smoking rates have fluctuated in Essex County with an overall decrease of 1.9 percentage points. In 2016, there were 3. 6% more smokers in Essex County (14.5%) than New Jersey (14. 0%). Essex County had more adult smokers than neighbo ring Middlesex (12.5%) and Union (13.0%) Counties.

As of 201 6, 41 million Americans struggled with hunger in the U.S. A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life. Obesity among food insecure people, as well as low income individuals, occurs in part because they are often subject to the same challenges as other Americans (more sedentary lifestyles, increased portion size) and because they face unique challenges in adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors, including limited resources and lack of access to affordable healthy food, cycles of food deprivation and overeating, high levels of stress and anxiety, fewer opportunities for physical activity, greater exposure to marketing of obesity promoting products, and limited access to health care.56 The percent of Essex County residents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) >=30 trended upward from 24.8% in 2011, to 26.8% in 2016.

Tumor Registry data for SBMC indicates a large percentage of late stage diagnoses for oral, digestive system, and respiratory cancers. Cancer Screening Breast Cancer (mammography) According to the American Cancer Association, women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x -rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 yea rs, or can continue yearly screening. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer. Women should also know how their breasts normally look and feel and report any breast changes to a health care provider right away. Some women - because of their family history, a genetic tendency, or certain other factors - should be screened with MRIs along with mammograms. The number of women who fall into this category is very small. In 2016, 82.7% of Essex County women over age 40 had a mammography within the past two years, up 31 percentage points since 2012. Compared to all counties statewide, Essex County performs in the top quartile.

Women between the ages of 21 and 29 should have a Pap test done every 3 years. Women between the ages of 30 and 65 should have a Pap test plus an HPV test (calle d \"co -testing\") done every 5 years. Women over age 65 who have regular cervical cancer testing in the past 10 years with normal results should not be tested for cervical cancer. Women with a history of a serious cervical pre -cancer should continue to be tested for at least 20 years after that diagnosis, even if testing goes past age 65. Some women - because of their health history (HIV infection, organ transplant, DES exposure, etc.) - may need a different screening schedule for cervical cancer. In 2016 , 76.7 % of Essex County women over age 18 ha d a pap smear within the past three years as compared to 74.5% of New Jersey women 18+.

Nationally, statewide and in Essex County, heart disease remains the leading cause of death . Responsible for 1 in every 4 deaths , approximately 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States each year . The AAMR for heart disease deaths decreased between 2007 ( 181.0/100,000) and 2016 (165.9 /100,000). The 2 016 Essex County mortality rate due to heart disease ( 165.9/100,000) was higher than statewide ( 162.7 /100,000).

Page 153 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Unintentional Injuries (3) The majority of unintentional injuries are preventable and predictable. Deaths due to u nintentional injury often occur as a result of motor vehicle accidents , falls, firearms, drownings, suffocations, bites, stings, sports/recreational activities, natural disasters, fires , burns and poisonings. Public Health prevent ion strategies including minimum drinking age requirements, seatbelt and helmet laws, smoke alarms, exercise progr ams and o ther safety awareness campaigns reduce unintentional injury and death.65 The unintentional injury death rate increased steeply between 2007 (27.8/100,000) and 2016 (40.8/100,000) in Essex County.

Diabetes (5) Diabetes Mellitus (or diabetes) is a chronic life -long condition that affects the body's ability to use the energy found in food. There are three types of diabetes - type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. All types of diabetes have one central commonality. In diabetes the body does not make enough insulin, or it cannot use the insulin it does produce, or a combination of both. Insulin is essential in taking the glucose the body takes in , in the form of sugars and carbohydrates and using it for energy. Since cells cannot take in glucose without insulin it builds up in the blood. High levels of blood glucose can damage blood vessels in the kidneys, hea rt, eyes or nervous system. That is why diabetes, especially if left untreated, can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness or nerve damage to nerves in the feet. In 2016, the county -wide AAMR due to diabetes in Essex County was higher tha n the statewide rate, and the rate in the comparison counties. Since 2011, the AAMR for diabetes has fluctuated with a decrease from 28.7/100,000 to 26.3/100,000. By race, Blacks had a higher AAMR for diabetes (36.7/100,000) than Whites (15.6/100,000) and Hispanics (26.6/100,000).

Premature Deaths An alternate method to reviewing crude or age -adjusted death rates as a measure of premature mortality is assessing Y ears of Potential Life Lost (YPLL). YPLL calculate s the number of years of potential life lost for each death occurring b efore a predetermined end point, in this case, age 75 per 100,000 population. Premature deaths are reviewed to highlight potentially preventable adverse outcomes. The Essex County YPLL rate decreased from 7,211.4 4/100,000 for the period 2010- 2012, to 7,102.75/100,000 for the period from 2014 -2016.

Behavioral Health -Related Death s Mental health is a state of well- being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, cope s with normal life stresses, work s productively, and is able to contribut e to his or her community. Mental illness or diagnosable mental disorders are health conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Depression , the m ost common type of mental illness , is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, increased health care utilization, and impaired functioning. However, r ates of mental illness treatment remain low, and often the treatment received is inadequate. Statewide deaths due to suicide decreased from 2014 (8.8/100,000) to 2016 (7.7/100,000), or 12.5 %, while Essex County's suicide rate remained constant at 5.9/100,000 for the same period. Essex County's 2016 suicide rate was lower than the rate statewide and for Middlesex County.

Infant Mortality Infant mortality, the death of a baby prior to his or her first birthday, is t raditionally used as an indicator of the health and well- being of a nation. Infant mortality is calculated as the number of infant deaths under age 1 per 1,000 live births. Great disparities exist in infant mortality by age, race, and ethnicity. Most frequent causes are s erious birth defect , preterm birth / low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), m aternal complications of pregnancy , and i njury .66 The overall infant mortality rate declined statewide from the period 2007 -2009 ( 7.8/1,000) to 2013- 2015 (6. 6/1,000). Essex County ranks in the middle performing quartile among New Jersey counties for overall infant mortality in 2012 -2014 and the Healthy People 2020 target of 6.0/1,000, but is among the worst performing quartiles in terms of the County Health Ran king benchmark. The Black infant mortality rate decreased between 2007 -2009 from 12.3/1,000 to 9.3/ 1,000 in 2013- 2015. Despite this decrease, the Essex County Black infant mortality rate is higher than for Whites in surrounding counties. 66 http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm Page 167 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Infant Mortality Rate: Rate of Infant (Under 1 Year) Deaths/1,000 Live Births State & County Comparisons, 2007 -2015 Essex County Source: NJDOH Center for Health Statistics NJ State Health Assessment Data - 2015 is most recent year available. 5.20 4.70 4.607.80 5.80 6.603.60 2013 -2015RATE PER 1000New Jersey Essex County Middlesex County Union County 6.67.85.86.6 0 2 4 6 8 102004-20062007-20092010-20122013-2015 National Benchmark: 4.0 Essex County 2015: 6.6 Page 168 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center Infant Mortality Rate: Rate of Infant (Under 1 Year) Deaths/1,000 Live Births by Race/Ethnicity State & County Comparisons, 20 13-2015 Essex County Source: NJDOH Center for Health Statistics NJ State Health Assessment Data - 2015 is most recent year available. #N/A3.0#N/A 12.38.29.3 5.94.35.3 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 142007-20092010-20122013-2015 Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Page 169 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Saint Barnabas Medical Center 5. Low and Very Low Birth Weight Infants Birth weight is th e most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and a significant determinant of post neonatal mortality . Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.67 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies persist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispanic Whites. Low Birth Weight In 2016, Essex County had a higher percentage of low birth weight babies (9.7%) than Middlesex County (8.0%) , Union County ( 7.6%), and the State (8.1%).

The three most common t ypes of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. In order t o survive, T ype 1 diabet ics must have insulin delivered by injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance disorder in which cells within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnosed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The risk factors for gestational d iabetes are similar to those for t ype 2 diabetes.70 Diabetes is increasing among Essex County residents. Between 2014 ( 11.3%) and 2016 (13.1%), the rate increased by 1.8 percentage points. In 2016, Essex County had the highest percentage of patients reporting diabetes among comparison counties.
