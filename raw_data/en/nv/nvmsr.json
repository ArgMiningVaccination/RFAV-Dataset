Foley Speaker of the House of Representatives Washington o.c. 20515 Dear Mr. Speaker: . . ftW ' .. .., As the House of Representatives is preparing to take legislative action on the Americans with Disabilities Act (the Act), I wish to restate my position on the need for anti-discrimination protection for people with AIDS and EIV infection. There is strong evidence that blood-borne infections such as HIV infecti~n are not spread by casual contact, and there is no medical reas~n for singling out individuals with AIDS or ~Iv infection for differential treatment under the Act. While some have proposed that workers who handle food be treated differently under the Act, evidence indicates that bloodborne and sexually-transmitted infections such as HIV are not transmitted during the preparation or serving of food or beverages. Food services workers infected with HIV need not be restricted from work unless they have other infections or illnesses for which any fooy service worker should be r ricte 'nee the Act limits coverage for persons who pose direct thre t to others, relaxing t~e anti-discrimination protection or ood service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the protection of the public health. Further, I would add that any policy based on fears and misconceptions about HIV will only complicate and confuse disease control efforts without adding any protection to the public health. We need to defeat discrimination rather \u00b7 than to submit to it. The Administration is strongly committed to ensuring that all Americans with disabilities, including HIV infection, are protected from discrimination, and believes that the Americans with Disabilities Act should furnish that protection. The Off ice of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program. Sincerely, ~411~ Louis w. Sullivan, M.D. Secretary This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 1 of 191JUN-26-90 TUE 15: 02 HRCF iIB.AfT Dole statement A.QA conference report P.02 'Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference report. I have supported the Americans with Disabilities Ac! from the beginning, because I believe that tl)is legislation fS ~ecessary to bring over 40 million disabled Americans into the malnstr~am of American life. We need to do that not only because it is just and fair for those disabled people, but because it is good for the country --because all of us can benatit from the talents and abilities of those who also have disabilities. In this bill, we have not made exceptions for any particular _form of ~~sabili~y. we nave included the menta,11 y }:\"etarded ai'ili those wi cere ral palsy, even though many peep) e fear and misunderstand those disabilities. We have include~ the deaf and the blind, even though many people misunderstahd those disabilit es, an e capa i i ies of ose e ave also nc u peop e with AIDS and other diseases, even thm1gh there fS-..-Llot of fear and roi s 1mderstand i nq around many disease1L. That is why I am to see conferenc committee has eliminate e amen men on oo an . ing at was passed by the other body. 'r!:!_is amendment was not needed to address legitimate concerns about diseases that can be transmitted throu9h food. But if there was any doubt, the conference report has removed them. The bill already stateq guite clearly that there was no requirement to e mploy a person who would \"pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other 'persons.\" The conference committee has added lan ua e to the bill tnat such a threat inc \u00b7 icant r sk that a commun cable 1sease could be transmitted on the jQb. The confer nee re ort further s ecif ies bill ~t override State health aws that are t the transmission of iseases throug food. I have received a letter from the Health Commissioner of my State, and the health officers of 26 other states, urginq us to adopt the co~ference report. This letter assures us that neces sary state health laws will remain in place under this bill, and warns t h at the amendment that was passed by the other body \"doe s e t.c.19 i c disservice to the public by contri ,buting to the misp erce~tlon of A t os as a disease. that can be spread by casual cont act. \" Now, I have ~Lsu hears, as I am sure many of my colleagues This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 2 of 191JUN-26-90 TUE 15:02 HRCF P.03 have, from some small busines -ses ~that are concerned that public rnisperceptions could damage their businesses. The~e businesses have said to us, \"We know that you cannot get AIDS by eatinc;J in a restaurant, but John Q. Public does not know that, and if we cannot remove these people from their jobs, we will go out of business.\" Well, that sounds like a serious situation, and I will tell you that when this argument was put to me I was concerned about it. I did not think it was fair to ask small ~usinesses to bear the burden of public fears and ignorance about AIDS, or about any other disability. But when you really think about this arqument, it begins to fall apart. When w~ debated this issue in the Senate a f~~ weeks aqo, one of our colleagues told us about a restaurant that he said went out of business because of rumors that an employee had AIDS. Rumors. It wasn 1 t true. No employee of this r~staurant had AIDS. But people thought he did. And they would not eat at that restaurant. Wel 1, I read the amendment ...... the socalled food- handling amendment --and it doesn't look to me like an employer could remove an employee based on a rumor. B~t th~y're telling us that they could go out of business because of a rumor. What does this tell us? I think it shows that discrimination is not the answer when you have this kind of public panic. If panic means we have to discriminate, does it mean we have to discriminate against people who are not disabled, whenever there is a rumor that someone has a disease? I was told about another case, where a resta\u00b5i:-ant learned that an employee had AIDS, and they immediately put him on disability leave. But word got out that an employee had AIDS, and people stopped going to the restaurant. And the restaurant went out of business. Now, I don't know if this is true or not. It may never have happened. Restaurants go out of business every day of the weak. But let / s say it did. What do~s this prove? Again, this amendment would be of no help. The employee was not even working in the restaurant any more, and they still went out, of business. so, once again, discrimination does not seem to be the answer. Discrimination does not end fear. Education does. I have don~ a little bit of historical res~arch, and I discovered something very interesting. In 1964, the National Restaurant Association asked the Congress not to p~ss the civil Rights Act that would h~ve outlawed racial se~regation in restaurants. We have nothing against black A~ericans, the Restaurant Association told us in 1964. And if we;had our way, we would not segregate our restaurants. But we have to deal with the public, and the public, you see, has a lot of fears and a lot of misperceptions about people of different races. And if we had to integrate our restaurants, our customers would just stop This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 3 of 191JUN-26-90 TUE 15:03 HRCF P.04 coming, and we would be out of bus-iness. sound f~miliar? Wel 1, let's look at wh.at happened. Congre~s did not listen to the Restaurant Association in 1964. We passed a law that said you have to integrate restaurants, you cannot discriminate b~sed on race. And you know what? I don't know of a single business in America that went out of business as a result. Not because there weren't some fears O\\.\\t there, or some misunderstanding. But because we as a nation successfully educated each other, and learned how better to live together. But the first step in that educational process was a clear statement from the Congress that discrimination is wrong. Discrimination is unacceptable. We will learn to ~ive together because we have to. That's what Congress did in 1964, and it was the right thing to do. It's the right thihg to do today. I urge us to adopt the conference report. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 4 of 191JUN-26-90 TUE 15:04 HRCF P.0~ \u00b7 The Chapman amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act allowing employers to deny jobs with food-handlifig duties to persons with \"communicable diseases\" --serves no legitimate purpose and should be defeated. The Administration op~oses this amendment. HttS Secretary Sullivan wrote to Congress that the amendment 0is not needed or justified. . . We need to defeat discrimination rather than submit to it.\" president Bysh has spoken out strongly against discrimination against people with HIV infection: \"There is only one way to de9l with an individual who is sick. With dignity, compassion, and without discrimination.\" The Chapman amendment would send a false a dangerous message that would undermine the efforts of our 12ublic health officials to calm unnecessary public fears about AIDS transmission. The amendment is not needed to deal with food-borne diseases. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, an empl~yer can deny jobs to persons who \"pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.\" Thus, someone with a food-borne illness --such as hepatitis or typhoid --will not be employed in a food-handling job. Many communicable diseases, however, are not food-borne. Extensive st~dies prove that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is nQ.t transmitted by food, handshakes, coughing, sneez1ng, or other daily contact. The Centers for Disease Control recommend that persons with HIV infection not be restricted in food-ha .ndling duties. The National Restaurant Association admits that there is no danger of HIV transmission but argues that public misperce~tiQltii. could cost them business and therefore they need to :discrim nate. Public ignorance has never before been considered a valid excuse for discrimination. If it were, it would not stop with this amendment. The public might avoid restaurants where employees with AIDS were in non-food-handling jobs, or where other customers had AIDS, or where someone was falsely rumored to have AIDS, or where an employee or customer had another disability, such as cerebral palsy or deafness. The amendment is Q~posed by the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the Catholic Conference and many other religious leaders, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the Food and Service Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.

Kennedy Chairman Committee on Labor and Human ReSO\\irces U.S. Senate Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Kennedy: The American Public Health Association, with a national and affiliate membership of over 50,000 health professionals, scientists, and commuriity health leaders, opposes the House language which reduces coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act for individuals with infectious or c:ommun . i cable diseases working in food handling positions. Our opposition to this amendment is based on s .everal reasons: Since 1917, APHA has brought together infection control experts from around the world to publish the premier reference book on infectious diseases, ttControl of Commun1 cablc Diseases in MCin.\" With respect to the transmissibility of HlV via food ~nd food handlers, this text and all oLher scientific authoriti .es indicates that HIV is n o t a food-borne illness. The House language is unnecessary since the Senate provisi o n in Section 103{h) already deals with Lhe issue of individuals with contagious disease who pose a threat to public healthd This provision is s1m1la1 to provisions in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, and the Fair Housing Amendrnenl.s. The language has served the public well and new language is not needed. The House language is vague and undermines the whole purpose of Lhe ADA. The ~enaLe language is more precise and is consi!:>t.ent with public health practice. All states codify those illness that are rcstrictable in spec.i fi c workplaces. Fo:r:\u00b7 example, Salmonella, Active TB, tmd Hepatitis A, among olhers, are food service restrictable diseases. It is quite common to have regulations list i nq health ca:r:\u00b7e setting, school, and day care restrictablc diseases. The determinations as to This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 6 of 191/ \u00b7 )) )J which diseases are restrictable in given settings is based on scientific knowledge of the transmission of those diseases. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact and does not grow in food, therefore it is not a food service restrictable disease. The Senate provisions would allow health authorities to continue to protect worksites against contagious diseases which do pose a direct threat to the health or satety of others. ~he intent of the House language is mean spirited and 1>erpetuates the harmful and unscientific notion that fear of disease is a reason to discriminate against individuals.

While certain communicable diseases may be reason to at least temporarily exclude food handlers, clearly, there is no evidence that HIV is transmitted by the foodborne route. Not only is the amendment, as it may pertain to HIV, irrational from a public health perspective, it absolutely sends the wrong message to the American people regarding the potential for compromise of food safety having anything to do with HIV. Several years ago, I spent a day as one of the several consultants to representatives of several major nationally known food companies, names we would all recognize. The message we gave them was clear in terms of the lack of transmission of HIV by the foodborne route. We concentrated on their responsibilities as employers is dispelling myths about AIDS. Nothing has changed about what is known about the transmission of this virus since that time. I would urge the Senate, in conference, to remove the House amendment excluding food handlers from protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Hatch Committee on Labor & Human Resources U.S. Senate Washington, DC 20510 Dear Senators Kennedy and Hatch: We are writing to underscore our support for the Americans with Disabilities Act and to reiterate our concern about any amendment reducing its scope of coverage for persons with HIV infection. As you may recall, the National Commission on AIDS issued a statement to that effect at the outset of its work in September, 1989, a copy of which is attached. As Secretary of HHS, Or. Louis Sullivan has stated, \"Any policy based on fears and misconceptions about HIV will only complicate and confuse disease control efforts without adding any protection to the public health.\" The amendment concerning food-handlers narrowly adopted by the House only reinforces unwarranted fear and perpetuates the discrimination that the ADA is designed to end. All evidence indicates that bloodborne and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV are nQ.t transmitted through food - handling processes. simply put, this amendment is bad public health policy. We hope that the conference deliberations can yield a bill t~at fully protects persons with HIV infection from fear and discrimination, without exception. ,1---. . /enclosure ,,..r_,i_.A/ __ (:' ~June E.

People living with AIDS and.HIV infection, and those regarded as such, deserve the same discrimination protections as all people with disabilities. Such protections from discrimination are not only necessary to enhance the quality of life for people with AIDS and HIV infection, they are --as the Presidential Report and the Institute of Medicine have reported --the linchpin of our nation's eftorts to control the HIV epidemi c . Thousands of Americans who should seek voluntary counseling and testing services and many who need lifQ- prolonging medical treatment will not come forward if they believe that doing so could result in the loss of their job or lack of access to public acconunodations.

We are extremely pleased that the majority of the United States Senate and the White House have made a bipartisan commitment to enact the Amer icans with Disabilities Act. We oppose any efforts to reduce the scope of coverage of the present bill, particularly with respect to HIV, the specific focus of this commission. The ADA will provide a clear and comprehen sive mand ate to greatly extend discrimination protect ions for people with disabilities. We are proud to endorse this landmark legislation.

This memorandum is in response to that commitment. Some of the information provided here will also be included in the detailed Questions and Answers packet on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) . There have been some important developments since the May meeting, including the issuance of the report of the President's AIDS Commission (officially, the Presidential Commission on the Human Imrnunodef iciency Virus Epidemic) which expressly endorses the ADA, the national mailing to all households of the AIDS information packet, and Vice President Bush's endorsement of the need for antidiscrimination protection for people with AIDS. There appears to be developing an increased national consensus in favor of nondiscrimination protection for individuals infected with the AIDS virus.

NEED FOR ANTIDISCRIMINATION PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS In the early years of our nation's experience with AIDS, initiatives to prohibit discrimination against HIV-infected persons were controversial. Some individuals misunderstood the impact of nondiscrimination laws and mistakenly thought that such laws might force the inclusion of people with AIDS into dangerous situations or into positions where they they could not competently perform necessary duties. Such misunderstandings of the law, coupled with ignorance and misguided fears about the AIDS virus and its transmission, led some to vociferously oppose nondiscrimination protection for those infected by the AIDS virus. Recently, with more information and education (including the nationwide mailing to all households of the AIDS information packet and the issuance of the report of the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic), a consensus seems to be emerging in favor of antidiscrimination measures to protect HIV-infected people. Proponents of such nondiscrimination protection include the U.S. Surgeon General, c. Everett Koop; the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the American Medical Association; the Public Health Service; the Centers for Disease Control; the National Institutes of Health; and Vice President George Bush. - 3 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 13 of 191The Presidential Commission concluded that antidiscrimination measures were necessary not only as a matter of justice or equity, but also for pragmatic reasons; without such protection, the Nation's efforts to control the AIDS epidemic could not succeed. The Commission stated: Throughout our investigation of the spread of HIV in the United states, the Commission has been confronted with the problem of discrimination against individuals with HIV seropositivity and all stages of HIV infection, including AIDS. At virtually every commission hearing, witnesses have attested to discrimination's occurrence and its serious repercussions for both the individual who experiences it and fo~ this nation's efforts to control the epidemic. Many witnesses have indicated that addressing discrimination is the first critical step in the nation's response to the epidemic. HIV-related discrimination is impairing this nation's ability to limit the spread of the epidemic. Crucial to this effort are epidemiological studies to track the epidemic as well as the education, testing, and counseling of those who have been exposed to the virus. Public health officials will not be able to gain the confidence and cooperation of infected individuals or those at high risk for infection if such individuals fear that they will be unable to retain their jobs and their housing, and that they will be unable to obtain the medical and support services they need because of discrimination based on a positive HIV antibody test. As long as discrimination occurs, and no strong national policy with rapid, and effective remedies against discrimination is established, individuals who are infected with the HIV will be reluctant to come forward for testing, counseling, and care. Subsequent to the issuance of the Commission's report, Vice President George Bush was one of many public officials who endorsed the Commission's call for antidiscrimination protection for people with HIV infection. The Commission's formal recommendations called for: Comprehensive federal anti-discrimination legislation which prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the public and private sectors, including employment, housing, public accommodations, and participation in - 4 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 14 of 191government programs, should be enacted. All persons with symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV infection should be clearly included as persons with disabilities who are covered by the anti-discrimination protections of this legislation. In making this recommendation, the Commission expressly endorsed the Americans with Disabilities Act as proposed by the Council; the report declared: The National Council on the Handicapped, an independent federal agency comprised of 15 members appointed by the President to make recommendations on public policy issues affecting people with disabilities, included a proposal for a comprehensive federal law of this kind in their January 1988 report to the President. Their proposal, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1988, was recently introduced in the United States Congress. The Commission believes that this type of comprehensive, disability anti-discrimination legislation should serve as a model for federal legislation in this area. Nondiscrimination measures have already been developed in regard to the Federal workplace. In 1986, a Task Force of the General Accounting Office, appointed by the Comptroller General, proposed employment policies to assure that HIV-infected employees be treated \"fairly and humanely.\" Following up on that proposal, in March of 1988, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued comprehensive guidelines which outline employment policies for federal workers who are HIV-infected. The OPM guidelines include statements that \"HIV-infected employees should be allowed to continue working as long as they are able to maintain acceptable performance and do not pose a safety or health threat to themselves or others in the workplace,\" and that \"agencies are encouraged to consider accommodation of employees' AIDS-related conditions in the same manner as they would other medical conditions which warrant such consideration.'' Further, the guidelines declare, \"there is no - 5 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 15 of 191medical basis for employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency clients who are HIV-infected.\" The foregoing exemplify a growing consensus against discriminatory treatment of persons infected with the AIDS virus and in favor of legal prohibitions of such discrimination. - 6 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 16 of 191II. AIDS AND THE NATIONAL 'COUNCIL ON THE HANDICAPPED In its authorizing statute, the purpose of the Council (\"to promote the full integration, independence, and productivity of individuals with handicaps in the community, schools, the workplace and all other aspects of American life\") and the Council's enumerated duties are framed with regard to \"individuals with handicaps.'' Intlividuals with handicaps are the constituency whose interests are statutorily assigned to the Council. For purposes of Title IV (which establishes the Council) and Title V (which includes Sections 501, 502, 503, 504, etc.) of the Rehabilitation Act, the statute provides the following definition of the phrase \"individual with handicaps:\" any person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment. As will be discussed in detail below, this language has been interpreted as including AIDS-infected persons. Therefore, such persons are among the groups that the Council has been charged with representing. The Council has consistently sought to represent the interests of its broad constituency, and has never attempted to differentiate between subcategories, diagnoses, or causation of those it has been assigned to represent. - 7 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 17 of 191Amendments to the definitions section of the Rehabilitation Act make it clear that on those occasions on which Congress considered the question of coverage of AIDS infection, it intended for the Council's charge to include persons with AIDS. The definition quoted above has been amended twice in regard to Sections 503 and 504 as they apply to employment, but not in regard to the definition as it applies to the Council's authority. Congress expressly left the Title IV (NCH) definition unchanged. The 1978 amendment stated that for purposes of Sections 503 and 504 as they re~ate to employment, the definition would not include persons whose current alcohol or drug abuse prevents them from performing job duties or constitutes a direct threat to others. More pertinent, in 1988, the Harkin-Humphrey amendment incorporated in the Civil Rights Restoration Act added the following language to the definitions section of the Rehabilitation Act: for the purposes of Sections 503 and 504, as such sections relate to employment, such term does not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unable to perform the duties of the job. By making this change to the coverage of Sections 503 and 504, Congress acknowledged that prior to this amendment the definition of individual with handicaps included persons with infections and contagious diseases, and, by not making a similar change to the definition governing the Council, Congress clearly implied that such persons were within the constituency to be served by the Council. - 8 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 18 of 191The National Council on the Handicapped has recognized the breadth of its statutory responsibility and has consistently characterized itself as \"the only Federal agency with the mandated responsibility to address, analyze, and make recommendations on issues of public policy which affect people with disabilities regardless of age, disability type, perceived employment potential, perceived economic need, specific functional ability, status as a veteran, or other individual circumstances\" (Toward Independence, p. iv; on the ~hreshold of Independence, p. viii). Thus, the Council has viewed itself as serving a very broad constituency without regard to \"disability type\" or \"other individual circumstances.\" Whenever there has been any suggestion that the Council was not paying adequate attention to a particular constituency group --e.g., people with hearing impairments, children with disabilities, elderly persons with disabilities, American Indians with disabilities, or other \"minorities\" within the class of people with disabilities --the Council has taken strong and effective action to consider and address the interests of these subgroups. Such an inclusive approach would be hard to square with any interpretation that would seek to exclude people with AIDS from the Council's purview. The inclusion of people infected with the AIDS virus in the Council's constituency is also supported by a recognition that there are very large areas of overlap of this group with people having what might be considered more traditional disabilities. For example, people with hemophilia are among those at the - 9 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 19 of 191highest risk of infection with the AIDS virus. Likewise, any person whose medical condition necessitated them to obtain blood transfusions during the period when blood supplies were not effectively screened is at risk of AIDS virus infection. Infants who receive the AIDS virus through transmission from their mothers during pregnancy and birth are most likely on a statistical basis to be born in situations of poverty and poor prenatal and medical care, just the situations that are linked to increased risks of birth defects and developmental impairments. The foregoing provides strong legal and pragmatic reasons for the conclusion that people infected with the AIDS virus are individuals with handicaps within the jurisdiction and responsibility of the National Council on the Handicapped. Given this scope of responsibility, the Council may not \"pick and choose\" among the members of its constituency; it is responsible for equally representing the interests of all people with disabilities, including those people who are infected by the AIDS virus. -10 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 20 of 191III. AIDS AND THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT In developing the proposed Americans with Disabilities Act, the Council consciously sought to avoid the quagmire of trying to develop a new definition of physical and mental impairment. The definitions of those terms under Section 504 established in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and regulations issued in 1978 were the product of much thought and negotiation, and have been widely accepted since their promulgation. For the most part, these definitions have served well. The Council's various drafts of the ADA consistently adopted verbatim the definitions of physical and mental impairment contained in the Section 504 regulations. In choosing the Section 504 formulation, the Council was not only acting consistently with its own statutory mandate as discussed above, but was avoiding the highly controversial and risky process of trying to \"reinvent the wheel\" by formulating a new definition. Creating new language and confronting organizations and individuals representing numerous diverse disabilities with the question whether they are or are not included in this new definition would have been a laborious and divisive prospect. The use of the Section 504 definitional wording avoide d contro versy and made use of terminology familiar to Congress, administrators, the courts, legal commentators, and people with disabilities and the organizations that represent them. The use of accepted definitional language helped to -11 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 21 of 191engender unity in support of the bill, with the result that over 50 national organizations representing persons with disabilities had endorsed it at the time of its introduction. In adopting the Section 504 definition of physical or mental impairment, the Council appropriated terminology with an established history of judicial and administrative interpretation. The expectation that the prior interpretation of this definition would guide its interpretation under the ADA was expressly stated by Senator Weicker and other sponsors of the bill during their introductory remarks. One aspect of that interpretation is the inclusion of people infected by the AIDS virus. At the time of the introduction of the bill, the Council, the Congressional sponsors of the bill, and the endorsing disability organizations were all aware of the judicial interpretation of the Section 504 definition to include persons infected with the AIDS virus. The interpretation of the Section 504 definition to include AIDS will be examined in detail in part III of this memorandum. It is important to underscore that the inclusion of someone as having a condition that meets the definition of a physical or mental impairment is not the end of the inquiry under the ADA. Even though a person qualifies as having a physical or mental impairment, that individual may still be excluded or otherwise treated unequally in certain circumstances. An individual with a physical or mental impairment may be excluded or disadvantaged for some other reason having no connection to the existence of the impairment. And perhaps more significantly, a person may be -12 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 22 of 191treated unequally because of a physical or mental impairment if this is pursuant to the legitimate application of qualifications standards, selection criteria, performance standards, or eligibility criteria, as for example a vision criterion for a job as bus driver. Such standards that disadvantage people with particular disabilities must be both necessary and substantially related to the ability to perform or participate in the essential components of the particular job or activity in question. Therefore, under the ADA, inquiries regarding unequal treatment of persons with disabilities can be viewed as entailing two different levels. First, is the individual being treated unequally because of a physical or mental impairment, perceived impairment, or record of impairment? This determination is based upon the definition of physical or mental impairment drawn from the Section 504 regulations and upon the facts of the case. Second, is the unequal treatment permitted under the Act? This will depend upon whether there are legitimate standards or criteria justifying the unequal treatment, whether such standards are necessary and can be shown to be sufficiently connected to essential components of the job or activity, and whether such criteria or standards have been properly applied to the particular individual with a disability. If an employer or service provider could show, in particular circumstances, that a person with a certain disability such as AIDS poses a substantial risk to the health or safety of -13 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 23 of 191co-workers or other participants, it would be permissible to establish qualifications standards or selection criteria that screen out such individuals. The employer or service provider would, however, have to have adequate evidence to establish that such standards or criteria were necessary and that they were substantially related to the essential components of the job or activity. The employer or service provider would also have to demonstrate that the particular individual in question failed to meet the standards or criteria, e.g., that the individual really did endanger the health or safety of others. Mere irrational prejudice or unfounded fears could not justify such an exclusion or unequal treatment. It is clear that a person who is infected with the AIDS virus qualifies as a person with a physical or mental impairment, perceived impairment, or record of impairment under the ADA. But any impression that the ADA mandates the automatic inclusion in jobs, programs, and activities of people who pose a real, demonstrable threat to others represents a basic and serious misunderstanding of the requirements of the statute. -14 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 24 of 191III. AIDS AND THE SECTION 504 DEFINITION The legal battles about AIDS coverage under Section 504 are still continuing, but the weight of existing legal precedents is strongly in favor of the interpretation that people infected with the AIDS virus are included in the scope of persons protected by the Act. The broad legal framework on this issue was established by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, a case that involved a schoolteacher with an infectious form of tuberculosis. The Supreme Court ruled that a person with a contagious disease is covered under the definition of a handicapped individual in Section 504. The Court stated that a basic purpose of Section 504 is \"to ensure that handicapped individuals are not denied jobs or other benefits because of the prejudiced attitudes or the ignorance of others.\" The holding that an individual with an infectious disease is a handicapped individual under Section 504 does not mean, however, that such an individual will necessarily prevail on his or her Section 504 claim. The Arline decision indicates that an individual must also demonstrate that he or she is \"otherwise qualified\" for the position or activity in question. In the context of the Arline case itself, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts for consideration of this second question. The lower courts have applied the principles established by the Supreme Court in the Arline decision to the context of AIDS. The recent report of the President's Aids Commission (the -15 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 25 of 191Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic) summarized the results as follows: \"the lower courts have consistently held that the range of HIV-related impairments, including asymptomatic HIV infection, are covered under Section 504\" (citations omitted). In the case of Local 1812, Am. Fed. of Gov. Emp. v. Dept. of State, a Federal court in the District of Columbia noted the parties' agreement that HIV-infected persons are \"physically impaired\" and \"handicapped'' under Section 504, \"due to measurable deficiencies in their immune systems even where disease symptoms have not yet developed.\" On June 30, 1988, a Federal District Court in California applied the principles established by the Supreme Court in Arline to an AIDS case. The court ruled, in the case of Doe v. Centinela Hospital, that a healthy person who had tested positive as carrying the AIDS virus was a handicapped individual under Section 504, stating, \"No matter what else Arline may fairly be read to hold, it clearly states that discrimination based solely on fear of contagion is discrimination based on a handicap when the impairment has that effect on others.\" Congressional statements have also consistently indicated that persons infected with the AIDS virus are included in the Section 504 definition of individuals with handicaps. This was the viewpoint expressed by both supporters and opponents of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, that was passed into law in March, over the veto of President Reagan. Recognition that AIDS and other contagious diseases or infections are covered by Section -16 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 26 of 191504 prompted the compromise amendment (discussed in part II above) that clarified that in the employment context, such coverage would not extend to situations in which a contagious disease or infection would either pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or would prevent an individual from performing the duties of a job. Were AIDS and other infectious and contagious diseases not covered under Section 504, then this amendment would make no sense. The Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 bill that has passed the House of Representatives and is currently pending in the Senate also incorporates the definition of individual with handicaps from Section 504. The House Committee Report accompanying the passage of the bill could hardly have made clearer the Congressional understanding that the definition encompasses infection with the AIDS virus: \"AIDS and infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are covered under this Act\" (Report 100-711, p. 22, n. 55). In his statement on the House Floor during the debates on this bill, Congressman Major Owens declared that \"The definition of \"handicap\" presented in section (b) (h) neither expands nor restricts the current interpretation of \"individuals with handicaps\" as it is used in section 504. All of the physical or mental impairments that constitute handicaps under section 504 will also constitute handicaps under this bill.\" He went on to state: It is important to underscore that this definition clearly intends to include persons with AIDS and all who are infected with the HIV virus, whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Various classifications and terminology have been used, but individuals are included if -17 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 27 of 191they have AIDS, AIDS-related-complex, or seropositivity, whether they have symptoms of the disease or are asymptomatic. The definition is intended to reflect a developing consensus in case law and administrative determinations that all who test positive for the AIDS virus have a \"handicap\" and are within the scope of protection afforded by such laws against discrimination on the basis of handicap. Numerous other Representatives, both opponents and proponents of the Fair Housing Amendments bill, made similar statements acknowledging that the section 504 definition includes persons who are infected by HIV (See, Congressional Record, June 29, 1988, pp. H 4918-4930}. For all of these reasons, existing legal precedents and Congressional statements strongly indicate that persons with AIDS or infected with the AIDS virus are covered by Section 504 and protected from discrimination on the basis of their handicap. -18 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 28 of 191V.

This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 35 of 191June 27, 1990 TO: Senator Dole FROM: Mo West SUBJECT: Chapman Amendment To follow up on your concern that the Chapman amendment did not receive serious consideration during conference. The Senate conferees voted 9-1 in favor of striking the amendment and the House voted 12-10 in favor of striking the amendment after lengthy discussion and individual statements by conferees on the issue. The amendment which originated in the House was defeated by both Senate and House votes recorded in conference. The Senate and House versions of the ADA conference report contain a \"direct threat\" provision to remove any person from a food handling position who would pose a direct threat to the safety and health of others. Even the proponents of the Chapman amendment, including the National Restaurant Association, admit that there is no scientific evidence that AIDS can be transmitted through the handling of food. Should evidence be found that AIDS were transmitted by food --the \"direct threat\" provision would apply. The bill makes clear that anyone who poses a direct threat of disease is not covered and can be refused employment, reassigned or fired. Persons who create an actual danger to the health or safety of others will be removed from the workplace under the ADA, thereby nullifying the Chapman provision. Thus, the thrust of the Chapman amendment is toward persons who do not pose any real three~ to safety. The Chapman amendment affects all food handlers with a disease regardless of whether the disease is transmitted by food. A food handler who has a disease that is not spread by food handling (which includes AIDS --transmitted only by sexual contact or blood) can be discriminated against, even though they pose no direct risk to others. Moreover, the Chapman amendment does not establish any medical standards --leaving restaurants owners and restaurant workers to litigate the issue. During House consideration of the ADA bill, Rep. Chapman decribed the purpose of his amendment as giving employers needed flexibility to deal with employees who are \"diagnosed as having an infectious disease such as \"AIDS\". Rep. Chapman did not seek to claim that his amendment was necessary to protect the public This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 36 of 191from infection; he explained \"the purpose of the amendment was to protect food handling business from loss of customers who would refuse to patronize any food establishment if an employer were known to have a communicable disease.\" He noted that \"there is a perceived risk from AIDS.\" This amendment is based on misperception, fear and prejudice. Restaurant owners argue that public misperceptions could cost them their business because of public health reactions to health rumors. The Chapman amendment purposes to provide flexibility through \"alternative employment\" to employees, thereby protecting businesses from \"economic damage.\" If the problem is one of misperception and economic loss -- transferring an individual to another job such as maitre'd or dishwasher would still perpetuate the same unfounded fea.cs. If the: argu.ment is one of a public health risk --the \"direct threat\" provision already in the bill provides the needed protections for employers to execise. Secretary Louis Sullivan, the Centers for Disease Control as well as major medical and public health organizations back anti- discrimination protections for all people with disabilities, including people with AIDS. The purpose of the ADA is to ensure this and \"direct threat\" language offers protections for employers in the case of a significant health risk.

We feel strongly that this amendment, which permits food service Industry employers to transfer workers who are Infected with the AIDS virus out of jobs that involve food handling, Is discriminatory. Such action undermines the fundamental premise of the entire bill. We concur with the unequivocal statements you have already heard many times from our colleagues in the Department of Health and Human . Services and the Centers for Disease Control that the HIV Infection cannot be transmitted through food. Inclusion of this amendment does a tragic disservice to the public by contributing to the mlsperception of AIDS as a disease that can be spread by casual contact. The Public Health Service and public health departments throughout the country have mounted ex1enslve educational efforts to inform the American public about modes of transmission of HIV disease, and to combat Inaccurate perceptions of risks posed by HIV positive persons. The appropriate response to publlc fear Is ongoing education, not legitimizing further discrimination in statute. For these reasons, the Chapman amendment is not only unnecessary, but is counterproductive. We strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act as it clearly addresses legitimate public health concerns. As currently drafted, Section 103 does not preempt our existing state public health laws with regard to individuals who 'J?ose a direct threat to the health _ or safety of others \" We feel that only with the removal of the Chapman amendment can public health and safety be well served in a truly non-discriminatory fashion. Again, we strongly urge you to protect the Integrity of the Americans with Dlsabllltles Act and the sound public health principles it sets forth by securing its final passage without the Chapman Amendment.

Catholic Conference, the public policy arm of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, urges you to oppose Senate approval of the Chapman amendment adopted by the House of Representatives to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As you know the bishops' conference strongly supported the ADA bill when it was considered by the Senate because of the urgent need to help disabled people, including those suffering from HIV infection, to participate fully in our society. The Chapman amendment should be resisted by the Senate for two reasons: first, it is unnecessary; and second, such an amendment would set a pernicious precedent that could undermine the principles embodied in the civil rights protections of this nation. The Chapman amendment is unnecessary because the ADA bill already includes provisions to cover situations in which employees with communicable diseases could pose a health threat to others. Clearly, the ADA would not require restaurants to employ food handlers whose contagious illnesses could be transmitted through preparing or serving food. The amendment is also dangerous because it would codify the idea that employers may discriminate against disabled people solely on the basis of the ignorance and prejudice of others. Proponents of this amendment have argued that, while there is no evidence that HIV infection can be transmitted through food handling, that food establishments must be free to cater to the fears and misunderstanding of some of their customers. Federal law, especially precedent setting civil rights laws should be based on higher principles and higher goals for our people. Sincerely, ~J(~~ Sharon M.

The effort to recommit this long overdue legislation based on the conferees omission of the Chapman Amendment is a disservice to the members of PVA, all veterans disabled in service to the Nation and all citizens with disabilities. To delay and possibly even thwart ultimate passage of this much needed legislation due to an amendment that is predicated on ignorance and bias and fosters continued discrimination would be unconscionable. For over forty, years the men and women of Paralyzed Veterans of America have worked toward the goal of eliminating attitudinal and physical barriers in all aspects of American life. To see this goal, which is now on the verge of becoming a reality, denied because of prejudice and misunderstanding is to ignore the sacrifices which veterans have made for all Americans.

Moreover, the Chapman amendment does not establish any medical standards-leaving restaurant owners and restaurant workers to litigate the issue. - -The words \"communicable disease\" and \"of public health significance\" are not defined. > -Without standards, each restaurant owner and each restaurant worker will have to decide what discrimination is allowed.

The Americans with Disabilities Act does not cover persons who \"pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals.\" This is sufficient to ensure that a person with a food-borne or air-borne illness such as hepatitis or tuberculosis --will not be employed in a food-handling job. Many communicable diseases, however, are not food-borne or air-borne. There is no need or justification to exclude people with these diseases from food-handling jobs, but the Chapman amendment would allow this discrimination. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is not food-borne or air-borne. Extensive studies prove that it is not transmitted by food, handshakes, coughing, sneezing, or other daily contact. The Centers for Disease Control recommend that persons with HIV infection not be restricted in food-handling duties. Employers in the food industry recognize that there is no danger of HIV transmission but argue that public misperceptions could cost them business and therefore they need to discriminate. Public ignorance has never before been considered a valid excuse for discrimination. What -if the public would not patronize a racially integrated restaurant? President Bush has spoken out strongly against discrimination against people with HIV infection. On March 29, 1990, he said that \"There is only one way to deal with an individual who is sick. With dignity, compassion . and without discrimination.\" The Chapman amendment purports to provide \"alternative employment\" to employees, .and to protect them from \"economic damage.\" Most employers in the industry, however, have a sma.].l number of jobs that do not involve food-handling. Many employees who work in such positions will not be qualified for alternative work. Even if no\u00b7 employee suffered economic harm as a result of this discrimination, the Chapman amendment would still send a false and dangerous message that would undermine the efforts of our public health officials to calm unnecessary public fears about AIDS transmission. \u00b7 As President Bush said, \"Every American must learn what AIDS is --and what AIDS is not. you can't get it from food or drink.

The Honorable Thomas s. Foley Speaker of the House of Representatives Washington o.c. 20515 Dear Mr. Specker: :. _. ..... As the House of Representatives is preparing to take legislative action on the Americans with Oiaabilities Act (the Act), I wish to restate my position on the need fer anti-discrimination protection tor feople with AIDS and HIV 1ntection. There is strong evidence that blood-borne infections \u00b7euch as HIV inf9ction are not spread by casual contact, and there is no medical teason for singling out individuala with AIDS or HIV infection for differential tteatment under the Act. While aome have proposed that workers who handle food be treat~d differently under the Act, vidence indicates that bloodborne and eexually-transmitted infections such as HIV are not transmitted duting the preparation or aerving of tood or beverages. rood services workers infected with HIV need not be restricted from work unless they have other infection or illnesses for which any tood service worker should be restricted. Since the Act limits coverage for persons who pose a dir~ct threat to others, relaxing the anti-discrimination protection tor food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the protection of the public health. rurther, I would add chat any policy based on fears and misconcapticna about HIV will only complicate and confuae disease control efforts without adding any protection to the public health. we need to defeat discrimination rather than to submit to it. The Administration is strongly committed to ensuring that all Americans with dieabilit1es, including HIV infection, are protected from discrim1nat1on, and believes that the Americans with Disabilities Act should furnish that \u00b7 protection. ,, The o~tica of Management and Budget has advised that there is no obje~~ion ~o the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.

All epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that bloodborne and sexually-transmitted infections such as HIV are not transmitted during the preparation or eervina o( food or beverages, and no inst4nces of HIV transmission have been documented in this setting. In s.tudles of households vhere over 400 family members lived with and/or cared for persons vith HIV infection and AIDS, no instances of casual transmission have been reported, despite the sharing of kitchen and bathroom facilities, meals, and eating and drinking utensils. If HIV is not transmitted in these settings, where exposures are repeated, prolonged, and involve contact with the body secretions of infected persona, often when HIV infection was unrecognized for months or years, it would be even 111 likely to occur in oth!r social or workplace settings, The pattern of casea would be much different from what is observed if casual contact resulted in.HIV transmission. The Public Health Service recommends that all food-service workers follov recommended standards and practices of good personal hygiene and food sanitation and avoid injury to the hands when preparing food. Should such an injury occur, workers are advised to discard any food \" This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 51 of 191--- . - - ---- -- -- Page 2 - The Honorable Henry A.

As we understand the provision, its inclusion in the ADA would riot improve the legislation and the AMA does not support it. The ADA employment discrimination prov1s1on already allows employers to require that an individual with a currently contagious disease or infection not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The AMA supports this general exception to the prohibition against employment discrimination. When appropriately applied, it will provide protection to the health of co-workers and the public. In this regard, there is no need for an amendment concerning food handlers. The existing ADA language provides appropriate protection from individuals, including food handlers, with contagious infectious diseases.

We oppose any amendments which will serve to weaken the present bill. We especially urge you to oppose the \"food handler\" amendment that will be offered by Representative Jim Chapman. This amendment fosters the same type of irrational discrimination that the ADA is intended to eliminate. There is no medical reason to bar people with the HIV disease from working as food handlers. All research concludes that the virus cannot be spread through food, handshakes, coughing, sneezing or other daily casual contact. Recently, Dr. William Roper, Director of the Centers for Disease Contt\u00b7ol, wrote a letter which states clearly that people with AIDS d6 not pose a risk to others by handling food . The proposed amendment would undermine the education efforts of the federal government and our various fai t.h groups, which are tt\u00b7ying to educate the public about how AIDS is contracted and how it is not. The amendment will have a disproportionate impact on poor and racial/ethnic minority workP.rs who rely on employment in the food service sector to care for themselves and their families. Adoption of this amendment will increase dependency upon fedet\u00b7al income suppot\u00b7l payments and significantly decrease the opportunity for individuals to live independent lives. The proposed amendment is also directly contrary to the stated position of President Bush . Our President has publicly staled, on more than one occasion, that all people with AIDS should be covered by ADA. Exceptions due to public ignorance are riot countenanced by President Bush. ADA already contains specific language that any worker who poses a direct threat (now defined as significant risk) to others is excluded from coverage in the employment section of the bill. We, as people of faith, cannot endorse lhis amendment which reinforces precisely the type of irrational discrimination ADA is designed to eliminate. It responds to public misperception and fear by legitimizing that fear through explicit accommodation in the law. Thank you for considering our views. Sincerely, Rev.

This amendment, which was accepted by the House on May 17, 1990 by just 12 votes, would reinforce the very kind ot irrational discrimination that the ADA is designed to eliminate; and 1t should bt rejeoted. The UFCW and its local unions have collective bargaining agreements w1 th employers throughout the food indu$try, including retail sales, meat packing, poultry, fish processing, and other rood processing, The vast majority of our members work ln the food industry; therefore, this amendment strikes at the heart of our members' economic concerns. While the Chapman amendment purports to provide alternate employment to employees to protect them from \"economic damage ... it is so badly overdrawn that a meat packer with Lyme disease could be barred for life from handling food. Significantly, the amendment does not specify that such \"infectious or communicable diseases\" be food or airborne, Moreover, when cast against the \"undue hardship\" standard already in the bill, this amendment could result in a termination of employment if the employer simply declares that reassignment to a non-food handling Job is \"an action requiring significant difficulty or expense\" as provided 1n the bill. Also, most employers in the industry have a small number of jobs that do not involve food handling. In any event, many employees who work 1n such positions will not be qualified for alter~ate work. Even 1f no employees suffer economio harm as a result or this discrimination, the Chapman amendment would still send a false and dangerous message that would undermine the efforts of our public health officials to calm unnecessary public tears about AIDS transmission.

Our union, the UFCW, i the largest union in the food manufacturins in.dustry. We represent several hundred thousand workers employed there. As you know, this amendment supposedly prot1ct employment opportunity for food handlers by providing that employers -\"shall make reasonable accommodation that would offer an alternative employment opportunity for which the employee is qualified.\" Practically speaking, I can tell you that there e.re very few \"alternative'' jobs :ln food manufacturing. Those jobs that do not directly involve food handling are 1118intenance (mechanical) jobs and sanitation jobs. Almost all food handlers would not be qualified to transfer into maintenance/mechanical jobs. 1bose are jobs which require special skills and training, As\u00b7you know most food plants . must also meet health and sanitation standards. There are special sanitation crews ~ho do this work. It involves cleaning the production areas including each machine used in the production process. An employer who considers an employee to be a risk as a food handler, would certainly not assign that person to work cleaning equipment. In short, there are few \"alternative\" jobs for workers who may be considered a risk under this amendment. In my opinion, this amendment does not add to the public health and safety protections that are now enforced through local, state and federal aaencies.

The former is a highly skilled area that is subject to ~lacement by seniority. Insdfar \u00b7as clerical poaitions are concerned, most packinghouse workers would lack the skills necessary to perform these kinds of duties in a plant. Aleo, the high incidence of cumulative trauma disorder (such as tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome) in the packinghouse area means, as a matter of practice, that any \"light-duty\" jobs (such as clerical) are already being filled by employees with this disability. Thus, these two options (i.e. maintenance and clerical) are virtually non existent for the average \u00b7 plant worker.

The only flaw in the Americans with Disabil- ities Act is an unnecessary ban restricting anyone infected with the AIDS virus from working as a :\u00b7ood handler. This restriction should be deleted during conference negotiations, since Health and Human Services secretary Louis W. Sullivan has i\u00b7eaffirmed that AIDS is not spread that way. The act truly is landmark legislation. It ex- tends full civil rights to the disabled, including per- :30ns with AIDS, and alcoholics or drug abusers who have undergone treatment. It compares with the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed discrimination based on sex, religion, col- or. race or national origin in public accommoda-tions, private employment and government ser- vices. Though the 1973 Rehabilitation Act barred companies and agencies that receive federal funds from discriminating against people with disabil- ities, the new act extends protections across public and private jobs, irrespective of federal funds. The bill is sensible, giving employers two years to make reasonable adjustments for disabled workers -unless such changes are an undue hard- ship. Buses, trains and subway cars would have to be accessible to wheelchairs. Telephone companies would have to accommodate hearing- 'or speech- impaired callers within three years. Structural impediments have not only kept qualified people out of the workplace but also have shut them out of many mainstream activities. Dis- mantling these barriers opens the way to self-reli- ance as well as mobility and job security. .Enabling millions of disabled people to work will more than repay the cost of making such ac- commodations. The benefits are overriding.

It is important to vote now for final passage of the ADA Conference Report and to deny any procedural actions (motion to recommit, point of order, filibuster etc.) aimed at stalling, weakening or killing the ADA. This will will ensure the rights of this--our country's largest minority group--and bring us to the level of protection of all other minorities in the country.

Beginning at the White House and ending at the United States Capitol, the demonstrators marched the 19 city blocks chanting \"Access is our Civil Right\" and other slogans in favor of AD A's immediate passage with no weakening amendments. The procession moved slowly in the 89-degree heat as individuals with disabilities and advocates made their way along the streets of the Nation's Capital. Aside from many demonstrators in wheelchairs, banners, hand- made signs and colorful tee-shirts made the procession a media extravaganza, as representatives of national, local and many independ- ent news services from around the country covered the event. Camera crews kept focus on the demonstra- tion well after arrival at the Capitol, where a brief ceremony was held . Mike Auberger, an ADAPT organizer and leader of the march, introduced Justin Dart, Chairman of the Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities and Chairman of the President's Committee on Employ- ment of People with Disabilities.

The announcement was made in Moscow by the State Commissioner for Labor, in response to an invita- tion extended by Chairman Dart and carried to the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister by Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, Ambassador Richard Schifter. This development is one of several agreements resulting from the meeting between President George Bush and President Mikhail Gorbachev in Malta, at which time the United States agreed to cooperate with the Soviet Union in efforts to improve the quality of Soviet life from a hu- manitarian point of view. An interagency task force, work- ing with the State Department, has been planning various ways to bring about closer contact between rehabilitation personnel in the two countries, particularly with respect to exporting knowledge of Ameri- can low technology to Russia to assist in the manufacture of aids, equipment and devices to make . work and living more accessible to its people with disabilities. The State Department decided that the Annual Meeting of the President's Committee, with its Exhibition of over 100 display booths featuring products and programs, its 40 workshops, plus several plenary sessions, would afford the Soviet delegation an opportunity to learn and observe Kansas Dual Party Relay Begins in May Kansas Relay Service, lnc.(KRSI), a nonprofit organizationinTopeka, KS, awarded Southwestern Bell a five-year contract to provide tele- phone service to speech or hearing impaired persons in Kansas. The relay system will be used to complete calls originating and billed in Kansas, to include outgo- ing interstate calls. Out-of-state callers will not be able to use the service to call telephone customers in Kansas. Customers will access the relay center using a standard TDD. Users type their phone request, which is received on a terminal at the Kansas Relay Center in Law- rence, KS. The relay attendant then places an outgoing call to the requested party and acts as a relay for the two parties by communi- cating their conversation by voice and TDD. The system will work in reverse, and a hearing person can contact a person with a hearing 2 impairment. \"There is a great need for this service in Kansas\", said Mary Manning, General Manager of Customer Relations for SW Bell's Kansas Division. \"There are ap- proximately 184,000 hearing impaired and 35,000 speech im- paired residents in the state\", she added. Five supervisors and up to 45 attendants will staff the Relay Center in Lawrence, and will receive special training to handle the calls.

On March 13, about 150 activists demon- strated in the Capitol Rotunda. Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley (D-WA) addressed the group from the balcony, as did House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-IL) and Congressman Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD). After the Congress- men spoke to the activists, they began chanting \"Access Is a Ci vii Right\", and \"The People United will Never be Defeated!\" Demonstrating inside the Capitol Building is against the law, and when the gathering was asked to disperse by U.S. Capitol Police, over 100 people continued chant- ing. They were subsequently arrested by the Capitol Police, many dressed in riot uniforms. The arrests took in excess of two hours, and the police used acetylene torches to sever the chains that people in wheelchairs used to link themselves together. Those arrested were charged with demonstrating in the Capitol and unlawful entry. All were later released on their own recognizance. Wade Blank, a founder and organ- izer of the disability rights activist group, commented: ''We're taking the strategies of the '60s that helped get rights for black and brown people and women, and using them for people with disabilities .\" Correction I The article appearing in the I I February issue (2.2) on the I I Social Security Disability I I Insurance Program was a I I reprint of a press release from I I the Social Security Administra- I I tion.

The mark-up version was intro- d uced jointly by Rep.John Dingell (D-MI), Committee Chairman, and Rep. Norman Lent (R-NY) and was approved by a vote of 40 to 3. The major provisions that were approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee are cited below. Amtrak Within five years, 50% of the following accessibility requirements must be available, and within 10 years, 100% of the following requirements must be fulfilled: *With specified exceptions, all new cars purchased or leased by Amtrak must be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. * New single-level passenger coaches need not meet wheelchair accessibility requirements, but after 10 years Amtrak must have avail- able on its trains a number of spaces to park and secure wheelchairs (for passengers wishing to sit in their wheelchairs) and a number of spaces to fold and store wheelchairs (for passengers wishing to transfer to a coach seat).The number of each type of these spaces must equal the number of single level passenger coaches in the train. These spaces may be located in either the coaches or in food service cars, with a maximum of two of each type in anyone car. * The accessibility requirements applicable to dining cars and the availability of food service will differ depending on the age and type of equipment. In all cases, 4 Amtrak will be required to provide equivalent food service in the most integrated setting practicable. Commuter Rail Transportation *Within 5 years all commuter rail system authorities must have at least one accessible car per train. * All new cars purchased by commuter rail system authorities must be accessible to individuals with disabilities, including indi- viduals who use wheelchairs. For commuter rail purposes, accessibil- ity does not require an accessible restroom if no restroom is provided on the car for any passenger, nor does it require space to store and fold a wheelchair. Private Rail Transportation * Provides an exception for historical and antiquated rail cars and stations served exclusively by such cars to the extent that compli- ance with accessibility requirements would significantly alter the historic or antiquated character of such cars or stations. Rail Stations * All new stations used in Amtrak or commuter rail systems must be accessible to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. *Amtrak must make existing stations within its system accessible (within 20 years), and commuter system authorities must make key stations within their systems accessible (within 3 years) A waiver of up to 20 years may be granted by the Secretary of Trans- portation to commuter authorities for certain extraordinarily expen- sive structural changes. * Improves current law by clearly allocating the responsibility for making stations accessible among Amtrak, commuter authorities, other public owners, and private owners. General * Provides a \"safe harbor'' provision for design of stations and rail cars during the period when new regulations, guidelines, and standards for accessibility are being developed by federal agencies, so that covered entitites can begin alterations without waiting for publication of the regulations. Telecommunications * The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will ensure that interstate and intrastate relay services are available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to persons with hearing and/ or speech-impairments. * Common carriers must provide telecommunications relay services -individually, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers within 3 years * Provides for FCC certification of state programs to make such relay services available on an intrastate basis. \"' Any television public service announcement produced or funded in whole or part by any Federal agency or instrumentality must include closed captioning. AMENDMENTS Five amendments were intro- duced by other members of the committee. Rep. Howard C. Nielson (R-UTI introduced an amendment which would allow persons with disabilities to use motorized wheelchairs or mechani- cal devices in wilderness areas. The Energy and Commerce continued page 6 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 72 of 191Tips and Trends Vol.2No.4 Ill House Surface Transportation Subcommittee Ill The Surface Transportation Subcommittee of the House Com- mittee on Public Works and Trans- portation met on March 6 to mark up those sections of Titles II and ill of the Americans with Disabilities Act which deal with transportation. Following a supportive opening statement by Subcommittee Chairman Norman Y. Mineta (D- CA), Representatives Glenn Anderson (0-CA), Bud Shuster (R- P A), John Hammerschmidt (R- ARK), Bob Clement (D-1N), Ron Packard (R-CA) and Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY> made opening remarks. They stated a need for the bill but expressed some concerns about it. However, Representative Boehlert also expressed apprecia- tion to people with disabilities for the work they are doing on behalf of their civil rights. The Subcommittee took up and approved a substitute for the House version of the Americans with Disabilities Act and referred it to the full Committee on Public Works and Transportation with one amendment. The amendment was introduced by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) to permit Mark Up commuter rail systems to have one car per train rather than to make all cars accessible. However, addi- tional accessible cars would have be added to a train as they became necessary. This substitute amend- ment differs from the Energy and Commerce Committee provision, which provides that all new cars must be accessible. The substitute measure is similar to the Senate version of ADA in most of the transportation areas, requiring new buses, rail vehicles and other vehicles operating on routes to be accessible to pro.pie with disabilities. Exceptions are for school buses and vehicles operating on a system of the National Register of Historic Places. Also, key train stations would be given 30 years to meet accessibility requirements if two-thirds of the rail stations are accessible in 20 years. The substitute bill also requires: Paratransit services to submit an annual plan of service to the Department of Transportation; The Secretary of Transportation to establish a standard for over-the- road buses within a year after enactment of the bill. State Relations Standing Committee The mission of the State Relations Committee is to provide a formal structure to enable State Governors' Committees or State liaison organi- zations to bring issues and concerns to the attention of the President's Committee. Further, the Committee assists states in matters concerning employment, plans, program issues, legislation, research and publications. The Committee's projects aim to meet the following objectives: 1. to identify employment related concerns and issues of the states; 2. to transmit these issues and concerns to the President's Com-mittee; 3. to develop and recommend strategies to address these ~cerns and issues; and, 4. to foster coordination and cooperation among states and the President's Committee in order to enhance the mutual achievement of employment-related goals. Projects developed and carried out by the Committee include the State Profile Manual, the Orienta- tion Manual for New Chairs and Executives, the creation of the Governor's Council and informa- tional letters to Governors, the conducting of the bid procedure for The standard could allow access to over-the-road buses via a board- ing chair and ramp. However, advocates for the Act have ex- pressed their opposition for safety reasons and because they don't believe that procedure will provide for a valid study of services to people with disabilities. By votes of 24-14, two amend- ments offered by Representative Shuster lost. One would have allowed the Secretary of Transpor- tation to grant waivers to the requirement for wheelchair lifts on buses in communities with 200,000 people or less if they provide an adequate paratransit system. The other would have exempted private entities, not primarily engaged in transportation but which operate buses or shuttles, such as for their employees, from some of the requirements. At the conclusion of the session, Representative Shuster and Ham- merschmidt announced that they would introduce other amendments to the bill at the mark-up session conducted by the full Public Works Transportation Committee sched- uled for April 3 .. annual meetings, and the develop- ment of a manual on the establish- ment and maintenance of local committees.

Fletcher, former United Nations Deputy and Aide to three Presidents, to chair the Commission on February 23. By nominating Fletcher, President Bush intends to show that he wants to restore the commission as \"an effective institution\", according to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. \"By selecting someone to serve as chair with some credentials in civil ri hts\", said Althea Simmons, Energy and Commerce, frompage 4 motion was dropped when it was agreed that this was not under the jurisdiction of this committee. Four amendments were intro- d uced by Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-CA); all four were overwhelmingly defeated by the committee. The amendments were: 1. Change the wording of the definition of a handicap to elimi- nate the wording 'regarded as having an impairment'. 2. Eliminate the reference to anticipatory discrimination. 3. Exclude individuals with contagious or sexually transmitted diseases. 4. Add a phrase to indicate that nothing in the ADA shall prohibit the railroad company to require a physician's certificate stating the prospective disabled employee's job does not pose a danger or risk to the heal th and safety of others. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) spoke vigorously against each amendment along with others. Supporters of the ADA say that passage out of the Energy and Commerce Committee was a triumph for people with disabilities. 6 director of the Washington bureau of the NAACP, \"it proves that the President has some sensitivity with reference to the Commission.\" But the conservative composure of the Civil Rights Commission concerns some in the civil rights community. \"Regardless of the Fletcher appointment\", said Ralph Neas, Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \"there are too many right- wingers on the Commission.\" Fletcher served as Assistant Secretary of Labor under President Richard Nixon, a Deputy Presiden- Publications The Office of Special Advisor to the President for Consumer Affairs released its Consumer's Resource Handbook, 1990 edition, in early February.

EHA With a conference slated to convene Reauthorization after the July 4 . . . recess, Congress is heading mto the home stretch in its effort to reauthorize the Education of the Handicapped Act's (EHA) discretionary programs. Both the House and Senate reauthorization bills would fund demonstration programs on transition for disabled students. But the House bill also would require all schools to spell out transition services in each disabled student's individualized education program (IEP) by age 16 (EOH, June 20). No Skills Transition services are \"by far the most important issue\" in the conference, said Paul Marchand, governmental affairs director for the Association for Retarded Citizens. Disabled students \"are coming out of high school with diplomas and no work skills at all\" said Justine Maloney, a member of the Learn~ ing Disabilities Association of America's executive committee. In addition to transition services, conferees will decide the fate of a House proposal that would fund demonstration projects in which In This Issue Vol. 16, No. 14 July4, 1990 Congress Ready For Final Votes On Rights Bill for Disabled . . . . . . .

Martha Ziegler, director of the Technical Assistance for Parents Programs (TAPP), said her group would like to see some ombudsmen demonstration programs, but it opposes the House plan to base some demonstrations in schools. In another provision, conferees will have to reconcile different proposals regarding stu- dents with attention deficit disorder (ADD). Different Categories Under the House bill, ADD students would be considered for special education under the category of \"health impairments.\" While the Senate bill does not address the issue, a Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee report says ADD students should receive services under EHA's learning disability category, as is currently done. Under the current system, ADD students who are not learning disabled may be shut out of special education, contends one parent group, Children with Attention Deficit Disorder. But the National Association of State Directors of Special Education and the Council for Ex- ceptional Children say the existing categories provide for sufficient service to ADD students. While lobbyists hope to retain sections from both bills, the House took longer to develop its reauthorization plan and its version has more general acceptance. \"The House, in certain instances, did take matters that were already in the Senate bill and developed them further,\" said Joe Ballard, director of governmental relations for the Council for Exceptional Children. ### Congress Ready For Final Votes On Rights Bill For Disabled With the last sticking point removed, Congress is expected to vote soon after the July 4 recess on the final version of a bill that would force employers to accommodate employees with disabilities. The Senate could vote as early as July 10 on S. 933, the Americans With Disabilities Act, which would require employers to accommo- date disabled workers. Last week, House-Senate conferees eliminated a controversial House amendment that would have allowed employers to transfer food service workers--including school cafeteria employees-- with AIDS or other contagious diseases out of food handling jobs (EOH, June 6). Health and civil rights groups opposed the amendment, arguing that AIDS is not spread through contact with food. While the food service industry endorsed the proposal, the National Association of College and University Food Services is not concerned that conferees killed it, said Clark DeHaven, the group's executive director. Supporters of the food service amendment acknowledged that it addressed fears about AIDS, but DeHaven said that on college campuses people are well-informed that AIDS is not spread by casual contact. President Bush has signalled his support for the bill. ### Update: \"'To Assure the Free Appropriate Public Education of All Handicapped Children:' The Twelfth Annual Report To Congress on the Implementation of the Education of the Handicapped Act\" will not be available until late August from the Clearinghouse on Disability Information, Education Department, 330 C.

Although the $1 billion bipartisan bill intro- duced approved by the House Education and Labor Committee last week would not provide the dollars, a passage in the bill may signal a new mood in Congress to increase the federal share of special education costs. The bill states that \"It is the policy of the United States ... to fulfill, by the year 2000, the commitment made by the United States in 1975 to provide 40 percent of the costs of educating children with disabilities, with at least 25 percent of such costs being provided by 1995.\" Unfulfilled Promise Although P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, promised that the federal government would pay up to 40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditures for special education by 1982, the actual amount never has exceeded 12 percent and currently stands at 7 percent. This year, lobbyists are pushing for a $1.2 bil- lion increase in special education funding, which would increase the federal share to 15 percent (EOH, March 28). While the language in H.R. 5115 would not provide more funding, it offers a glimmer of hope for such a hike, advocates say. Democrats and Republicans are showing \"a growing commitment to get us closer to that 40 percent mark,\" said Joe Ballard, director of government relations for the Council for Exceptional Children. \"We would support any mechanism that would shake P.L. 94-142's funding out of the decade- long doldrums of the 7 to 10 percent range,\" added Paul Marchand, governmental affairs director for the Association for Retarded Citizens. A hike to 40 percent would be ideal, but \"we'll take what we can get,\" added Justine Maloney, a member of the Learning Disabilities Assoc- iation of America's executive committee. But Marchand said it's important for Congress not to ignore special education funding beyond the basic state grants in Part B of EHA. Other Needy Programs States are deciding year by year whether to remain with the early intervention program for children from birth through age 2 based on federal funding, he said, and at the current funding level, \"many states will not bite.\" Most states are scheduled to fully implement their early intervention systems next year, if they stay with the program. In addition, Congress would need to add about $100 million to its preschool funding to give states $1,000 per child, the maximum author- ized by P.L. 99-457, the 1986 Education of the Handicapped Act amendments . Literacy Program Includes Disabled While the congressional appropriations panels decide just how much to give special education, another part of H.R. 51115 also could channel money to people with disabilities. The bill would establish a National Institute for Literacy that would conduct research and demonstration projects on a variety of topics, including the needs of adults with learning disabilities. Maloney said such research could help point out the ties between illiteracy and disabilities . If an adult has gone through school and not \"cracked the literacy code,\" she said, \"it's got to be more than just not paying attention and lousy teachers.\" In addition, H.R. 5115 would provide student loan deferral and forgiveness for future teach- ers, which could help head off the shortage of special education teachers. The bill is expected to reach the House floor July 12or13. ### This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 79 of 191Page4 Education of the Handicapped July 4, 1990 Developmental Disabilities Bill Gives More To University Programs ( A Senate panel passed a bill last week that would reauthorize personnel training and ad- vocacy funds for developmentally disabled students. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Com- mittee passed S. 2753, a bipartisan bill that would reauthorize through 1994 a variety of state grants, university-affiliated pro- grams and advocacy efforts under the Develop- mental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. For fiscal 1991, S. 2753 would authorize $18.4 million for university-affiliated pro- grams, currently funded at almost $13.2 mil- lion, a staff member from the Senate Disability Policy Subcommittee said. The programs provide support and training for developmentally disabled people and the professionals and volunteers who work with them, with the goal of increasing their inde- pendence and productivity. Protection and advocacy groups, currently re- ceiving almost $20.5 million in federal funds, would be authorized for $27 million in 1991 under the Senate bill. State grants, which could be used both to de- velop comprehensive service plans and imple- ment those plans, would be authorized at $81.3 million in fiscal 1991, a significant hike from the current $62 million appropriation. The Bush administration is proposing level funding for the developmental disabilities programs. Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., introduced that bill, S. 2704, earlier this month, but it is expected to bow to the new bipartisan bill. The law was last reauthorized in 1987 (EOH, Nov. 11, 1987). ### Senate Confirms Williams To Head Office For Civil Rights The Senate on Friday approved Michael Williams to head the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. By voice vote, the Senate confirmed Williams as assistant secretary two days after the Senate Labor and Human Resources Commit- tee endorsed him for the job. The Treasury Department's current deputy assistant secretary for law enforcement, Williams will bring to OCR a law enforcement background in both Washington, D.C., and his native Texas (EOH, April 11). However, Williams is stepping into a firestorm building for the past decade between the civil rights community and OCR, which is charged with enforcing civil rights laws--including the 1973 Rehabilitation Act--in schools and colleges that receive federal funds. OCR's critics have praised Williams' back- ground, but they warn that incomplete investi- gations and slow complaint follow-ups have become standard operating procedure at OCR. In an interview Friday, Williams said he does not anticipate malcing large-scale changes in OCR's operations, but he said he will not hesitate if changes are warranted. \"I think it would be a fair assertion that any office can be improved,\" Williams said. \"I think it would be unfair to say that the place is a can of worms. It's my assessment that that office has done a fair job in protecting the rights of parents and students.\" Senator Expecting Change Williams assumes his new post under pressure from a leading lawmaker. At a May hearing on his nomination, Sen. Paul Simon; \u00b7D-111., told Williams he will try to abolish OCR if the agency does not make significant progress in the next few months (EOH, June 6). The senator told Williams he wants a report on his desk sometime early next year detailing the changes Williams plans to make. If he does not like what he sees, Simon said, he will introduce legislation to abolish the office. ### This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 80 of 191( July 4, 1990 Education of the Handicapped Page5 New York Group Helps Train Disabled Youths For Mainstream Jobs School programs un~er the wi~g of.a New York City business council are helping disabled young people land mainstream jobs. With Labor Department funds, six community groups run the programs, which this year are helping some 200 disabled 16-to 24-year-olds at five high schools move from school to work. I I The students, Innovations variously dis- . \u00b7 abled, \"used to be earmarked for no employment whatsoever, but they are now being integrated into the main- stream work place,\" said Danny Gartland, as- sistant director of operations for the New York City private industry council (PIC). When the program began in 1984 with roughly the same number of students and about half its current funding, job placement rates were about 5 percent and retention rates also were abysmally low. But in 1985 the PIC devised a central strategy resulting in'a single source of funding, one chain of command and consistent program standards. Most of the project's funding-- about $730,000 last year--comes from the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Now, job placement rates are 52 percent ~d retention rates 46 percent for all the PIC spar- ticipants in programs for the disabled. Young Adult Institute One of the community groups the PIC subcon- tracted with operates one of the nation's most innovative JTPA-funded school-to-work pro- grams for disabled youths. The Young Adult Institute (YAI) program works with public schools on an \"open-entry, open-exit\" system in three-mon~h cycl~s year- round. This year, the program is serving 68 disabled students ages 16 to 21 at a cost of $7 ,000 to $8,000 per student. Y AI holds classes in the schools five days a week\u00b7 half the day is spent on job skills train- ing a:id the other half on \"employability behav- ior skills.\" The employability skills, developed from a survey of more than 700 employers m the area, include punctuality, proper dress, correct social behavior on the job, teamwork, taking criticism well and asking for help. Students like the program so much they cut their other school classes but show up on the days they have Y AI courses, said Mich~e! . Kramer, Y AI' s director of employment rmtia- tives. 'We give them something that's real-- that has a definite outcome--something that's meaningful for them.\" Hands-On Experience For 10 days, students can sample work they might be doing. For example, they may work in the school cafeteria in preparation for a food-service job. Most of the jobs the students eventually land are as housekeepers, porters and other entry- level service and retail jobs. However, the less handicapped students usually receive more highly skilled jobs, such as clerical and office positions in financial institutions, where they earn up to $20,000 a year. The placement rate for all YAI students is about 63 percent, Kramer said. Once placed, the students are \"shadowed\" by job coaches for a month or more. Y AI also operates a one-day workshop for busi- ness people \"to sensitize them and help break down barriers\" in hiring the disabled, Kramer said. \"The receptivity of the business sector has changed. We see that as one of our maj~r roles, effecting social change as well as finding jobs for these students.\" A National Model In its effort to find competitive employment for the disabled, YAI provides a model for other school-to-work programs. In March, the Education Department, in its annual report to Congress on the implementa- tion of the Education of the Handicapped A~t, urged educators to improve work opportunities for the disabled, saying that more than half the students are unemployed a year after they leave school (EOH, March 28).

The Senate Labor and Human Resources Com- mittee unanimously passed H.R. 4151, which would authorize $22 billion to continue the Head Start program for five years. The bill would gradually increase authoriza- tion for Head Start to $7.6 billion in fiscal 1994, enough for the program to serve the esti- mated 2.5 million eligible children, with 10 percent of the seats reserved for preschool- ers with disabilities. In May, the House passed its version ofH.R. 4151, which would authorize slightly less-- $20.3 billion--over five years to expand Head Start (EOH, April 11). The Senate panel accepted House language in H.R. 4151 on several non-Head Start pro- grams, but it substituted its own Head Start reauthorization plan, originally contained in s. 2229. In addition to reauthorizing Head Start, the Senate's version ofH.R. 4151 would continue the Follow Through program for five years and create a new Head Start Transition Project to help low-income children adjust to elementary school. The new program, proposed by panel Chair- man Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., would fund demonstration programs that would extend Head Start's nutrition, health and other services into the early elementary grades. \"All too often, schools have not addressed the noneducational needs of students and their families,\" Kennedy said. \"This transition is essential to their success in school.\" The transition program mirrors existing Fol- low Through demop.stration projects. Kennedy offered the new program because of language in both House and Senate Head Start bills that would change Follow Through, tying it to the Chapter 1 program for disadvantaged students. The bill would provide $20 million each fiscal year for the transition project, which would award grants to schools and Head Start agen- cies. The bill aims to fund at least one demonstration project in each state. \"The transition projects, we feel, are an impor- tant model to extend the Head Start principles to elementary school,\" said Patty Cole, staff assistant for the Senate Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism Subcommittee. For Follow Through, the bill would hike fund- ing authorization from $7 .2 million this year to $20 million in fiscal 1991, and then $10 million more each year through 1994. A committee aide said the Senate may consider H.R. 4151 soon after its July 4 recess. Staffers expect an easy conference if the Senate passes its bill. ### Use this form to subscribe (or extend your subscription) to EDUCATION OF THE HANDICAPPED 0 Please enter my subscription for one year at $220.00 0 Please extend my current subscription by one year at $220.00 Acct.*-------------- 0 Payment enclosed 0 Charge Publications, Inc., Box 1453, Alexandria, VA 22313-2053 (703)739-6444 ( This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 82 of 191July 4, 1990 Education of the Handicapped Research Briefs + Adapt Classrooms To Suit Many Learning Styles: It's relatively easy to define learning styles and not too hard to survey students to find out how they learn best. What may be difficult is adapting the individual classroom to accommodate each style. One middle school special education teacher transformed her resource room into a learning- styles center by giving each student an inven- tory to determine his or her preferred style, then making the appropriate changes in the way she taught and in the room. Her instructional changes included offering all lessons in visual and auditory form for differ- ent learners, using index cards for practice and review for tactile learners, and posting ques- tions and materials around the room for kines- thetic learners, who need to travel while they think. Using creativity instead of money, she: Used the computer as a divider between desks to create study nooks. Headphones at one study nook hooked up to a recorder for those who need music to study; the other nook has headphones with no music for those who need silence. Set up an informal corner, using a chair that flips out into a small bed, for groups to study on. Arranged rows of desks in a semicircle near the board for conventional instruction, a style some students prefer. Set up a round table for student group work and teacher/student conferences. Lowered the thermostat, because most stu- dents expressed a preference for a cool room. Students who like it warmer wear warmer clothes. Compiled individualized resources in an expanding file. The materials include puzzle cards to help visual learners and sandpaper so tactile learners can practice spelling and math by drawing on the paper with their fingers. \u00b7 Page7 Students add to the file as they learn about their own needs. The result: The learning-styles center has become a place in which students feel they have choices and a sense of power over how they learn.

A recent review of the research suggests that cooperative learning is a mixed bag for special education students. Such activities do seem to help interactions between disabled and non- disabled students, but they are no guarantee of academic improvement for disabled students. Some studies reported that special education students didn't suffer from working in small groups, but they didn't outperform those working individually. Other studies reported significant increases in disabled students' achievement after teachers brought coop- erative learning tactics into class. _ The varied task structures and methods of prize-giving in these studies made a difference in achievement, making it difficult to find factors leading to success. The review did conclude, however, that in cases in which students rely solely on each other for practice, feedback and instruction, they need a high-ability student in their group to facilitate learning.

Hispanic LD students are much less likely to be popular and twice as likely to be rejected than their peers, researcher Herbert Ochoa found in a study of 800 regular and 60 His- panic LD fourth- and fifth-graders. \"We should not say that all LD students are not accepted, but the majority are not,\" said Ochoa, a professor at the University ofTexas- Pan American in Edinburg. \"Like Anglo LD pupils, Hispanic LD pupils tend to have lower acceptance as a group.\" Target Social Skills Ochoa, who conducted the study for his doc- toral dissertation at Texas A&M University in College Station, said the study means schools should address both academic and social skills when they integrate LD students. The children in Ochoa's study labelled their peers as belonging to one of six status groups in the classroom and at play: popular, contro- versial, average, neglected, rejected and other. At play, only 5 percent of the Hispanic LD stu- dents were popular, compared with 18 percent of their peers. For work, the popularity ofnon- disabled students stood at 19 percent, while only one LD student was popular. At work and play, 16 percent of the nondis- abled students were \"rejected\" by their peers, but 30 percent of the LD students fell into that category for play and 32 percent for work. Overall, the students rated 58 percent of their nondisabled classmates either popular or aver- age. But only 42 percent of the Hispanic LD students received one of those ratings for play, 4 7 percent for work. Ochoa hopes to conduct further research to determine why a few LD students are popular.

During the past several years, Easter Seals staff met regularly with Congressional staff and rep- resentatives of the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the American Public Transit Associa- tion to discuss issues affecting mass transportation services for persons with disabilities. One product of these discus- sions was the development of a proposal to create and demon- strate a cooperative model for accessible public transportation involving national and local disability and transit interests. Background In the FY 1988 Department of Transportation appropriations legislation, Congress called for Project ACTION, indicating that it should be \"designed, imple- mented. and evaluated for na- tional dissemination by the National Easter Seal Society. \"The Society would receive demonstration funds and contract with appropriate consultants and other entities, including transit systems and disability organiza- tions as needed to conduct dem- onstrations and related project activities.\" Project ACTION will yield a cooperative model program of techniques to: identify people with disabilities in the community and their transportation needs; develop outreach and market- ing strategies; develop training programs for transit providers; develop training programs for transit users with disabilities; apply technology to eliminate barriers to transportation accessi- bility.

More than 40 interested indi- viduals attended the meeting in- cluding representatives from 15 of the 17 steering committee organi- zations. Brian W. Clymer, administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), kicked off the meeting with his announce- ment that UMTA would soon approve an additional $650,000 for the project bringing the total federal commitment to $3 million. Project ACTION represents a significant portion of UMTA's research budget. The steering committee mem- bers were treated to an excellent overview of our research results by Jim Flemming, a consultant with Project ACTION. The findings of our reconnais- sance smvey of 112 transit systems throughout the United States highlighted the presenta- tion. Roger Slagle, a professional staff member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee for the U.S. House of Representatives gave the audience an informative progress update on the transit provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. One of the most useful results of the day-long meeting was lengthy discussions by steering committee members that will help us prioritize the areas of Project ACTION for funding. A subcommittee was also formed to review the proposals that are submitted in response to our request for proposals. Members of this review sub- committee will apply our criteria to each proposal before recom- mending funding decisions.

Secretary of n-anspor- tation Samuel K. Skinner unveiled his \"Statement of National Trans- portation Policy-Strategies for Action.\" In addition to many major policy initiatives, the strategy addresses several aspects of disability-related policy which are summarized below. The transportation infrastruc- ture is vital to the nation's econ- omy, and it must seive the needs of all Americans, including the young. old, minorities, disadvan- taged, disabled, and people living in urban and rural communities. An improved quality of life requires increased mobility and access; this is especially true for the transportation disadvantaged and those who are elderly and disabled. All Americans have the right to enjoy the benefits of transportation, and we must assure that transportation seiv- ices and facilities accommodate their needs. This includes work- ing with private carriers and public transportation agencies in preparing plans or standards for assuring that their vehicles are accessible to passengers in a timely and cost effective manner. Many citizens would like vehicles of all kinds-buses. automobiles, aircraft, and railcars-to be made more acces- sible for the millions of Americans who have some physical or men- tal disability. Disabled citizens cite a lack of appropriate trans- portation as the chief barrier to getting jobs and being fully productive members of their communities. There is wide support for federal legislation guaranteeing the rights of people with disabili- ties. At the local level, where direct responsibilities for transit accessibility lie, there are positive examples of successful efforts to seive disabled and elderly travel- ers, such as those of the Seattle Metro Transit System. The benefits of transportation Spring 1990 must be available to all Ameri- cans, including economically and socially disadvantaged, minority, young and old, and people with disabilities. Many individuals are not able to take advantage of America's opportunities because they do not have access to trans- portation services. More than 40 million Ameri- cans are disabled, and many have special transportation needs; many cannot drive, or live in areas where they are not now ac- commodated by public transpor- tation. The transportation system can be a key to breaking their isolation. \"All Americans have the right to enjoy the benefits of trans- portation, and we must assure that transportation serv- ices andfacilities accommodate their needs.\" Improvements in design of automobiles and other vehicles, clear road signing, and special- ized transportation services can all help better accommodate elderly and disabled citizens. Sidewalks, curb cuts, automatic electric doors, ramps, and level access platforms at stations and other buildings permit improved access and mobility for disabled and elderly Americans. Buses accessible to the dis- abled can provide access to individuals who would otherwise not be able to travel. Over 35 percent of public transit buses are now equipped with wheelchair lifts, and many buses and other public transportation vehicles and facilities have low or level entries to accommodate disabled per- sons. 3 Much more must be done. The Department of Transportation has the responsibility for enforcing access and mobility requirements in the transportation sector, and will move aggressively to cany out that responsibility. It is federal transportation policy to do the following: Promote greater access by working with transportation providers and representatives of disabled individuals and other transportation disadvantaged citizens to identify transportation facilities where access improve- ments are necessary, and assist in developing effective designs and implementation schedules for meeting those needs; Assist public transportation agencies in preparing plans and standards for acquiring vehicles accessible to disabled passengers, to meet requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner; Develop criteria and review procedures for enforcing confor- mance with federal accessibility requirements. To better assist transportation providers in extending the access and mobility of Americans, the Department proposes to develop criteria and review procedures for enforcing conformance with federal accessibility requirements for air carriers and federally assisted mass transportation operators. To ensure that all Americans have access to necessary trans- portation service, the DOT will work with transportation provid- ers to increase access and mobil- ity to the disabled.

The committee passed the ADA on April 3 by a vote of 45-5. Following a subcommittee mark up in March, the April 3 action was the third in a series of committee mark ups. It is antici- pated that President Bush will sign the sweeping legislation into law this year. The Public Works Committee considered nine amendments to the subcommittee bill. Three tech- nical amendments were offered by Congressman Norman Mineta (D- CA) and were accepted by the committee. These amendments specify that: private contractors that provide fixed-route transit are required to buy accessible vehicles; private entities that are in the principal business of providing transportation and that operate vehicles with seating capacities of less than eight passengers must have at least one accessible vehicle in their fleet; intercity over-the-road trans- portation providers must still comply with general nondiscrimi- nation principles during the period when interim accessibility regulations are in place; people with physical or mental impairments, including visual impairments, are eligible for paratransit seIVices if they are unable to board or disembark a fixed-route vehicle; people whose disability pre- vents them from getting to or from the bus stop are also eligible for paratransit seIVices; additional paratransit seIVices can be provided voluntarily. Six other amendments were also considered but none were adopted by the Public Works Committee. These amendments Spring 1990 \"Our challenge is to [ensure that] the American main- stream includes all of our disabled citizens. \" -President George Bush in his State of the Union Message to Congress, January 31, 1990 would have: delayed by 30 months the ef- fective date of ADA compliance; provided local communities with the option of how to provide transit seIVices to persons with disabilities; prohibited mandatory accep- tance of special seIVices; required all rail stations to be made accessible, and removed the exemption for one-car trains and historic vehicles. provided $200 million in funds allocated for access purposes; replaced Title II of the bill with the Senate passed version of Title II. In earlier action, the House Public Works Surface Transporta- tion subcommittee marked up the transit provisions of the ADA on March 6. Some of the most important changes to the transit provisions specify that: precise definitions of \"demand- response systems,\" \"fixed-route systems,\" and entity\" are required; public entities are prohibited from remanufacturing a vehicle if it is not accessible, or from pur- chasing an inaccessible, remanu- factured vehicle; historic vehicles that are re- manufactured are exempt from having to be accessible if making the vehicle accessible would sig- nificantly alter its historic charac- ter; 4 response time for paratransit seIVices should be comparable to the extent practicable. All other seIVice criteria that are consid- ered in comparing fixed-route to seIVices must be comparable; people eligible for paratransit seIVices are defined as persons who cannot board, ride, or disem- bark a vehicle without the assis- tance of another person (The definition allows for one compan- ion to travel with the person); the seIVice area of paratransit is defined as that which is encom- passed by the public entity's fixed-route system. Paratransit seIVice is required to be provided in the seIVice area of each public entity operating a fixed-route system (other than portions of the seIVice area that solely provides commuter bus and commuter rail seIVices); paratransit seIVices must be developed through a public par- ticipation process. The process will result in a plan that will be submitted to the Dar; coordination of paratransit seIVices is encouraged, and dupli- cation of seIVice provided by another operator is not required; key stations for rapid, com- muter, and light rail systems will be defined by the Dar; key stations must be made accessible within three years except that extraordinarily expen- sive changes can be made within 30 years except that two thirds of key stations must be made acces- sible within 20 years; historic trains are exempt from having to be accessible if making them accessible would signifi- cantly alter their historic charac- ter; commuter rail operators do not have to purchase new accessible vehicles if they can show that they have at least one accessible car per train; Intercity bus operators must {continued on the next page) Project ACTION Update This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 88 of 191ADA Would Guarantee Civil Rights of All Americans with Disabilities Persons with disabilities are our nation's largest and fastest growing minority. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are 43 million persons with one or more disabili- ties in the United States. One out of every five Americans have some type of disabling condition. People with disabilities have all manner of disabling conditions-- mobility impairments, blindness and vision impairments, deafness and hearing impairments. speech and language impairments. and mental and learning disabilities. Why the ADA Is Needed People with disabilities are often unreasonably excluded from significant opportunities for social participation, including access to public and private facilities, education, employment, housing. transportation, communications, health services, recreation, and access to public services. According to national polls by Louis Harris and others, people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society. and are severely disad- {from page 4) provide interim service to people with disabilities before the DOT issues final regulations on this subject which will become effec- tive in seven years for small providers of intercity service and six years for large operators. How- ever, during the interim period, intercity operators are not re- quired to make structural changes in over-the-road buses and boarding assistance devices will not have to be purchased. These changes to the legislation do not alter the requirement that all new fixed-route vehicles must be accessible and that paratransit be provided to supplement that service. Spring 1990 vantaged socially, vocationally. economically, and educationally. The unemployment rate among people with disabilities is 67 percent. For persons with disabili- ties who are members of racial minorities, the rate of unemploy- ment is 82 percent. But persons with disabilities are not protected under the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968. And the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (commonly ref erred to as \"Section 504 \") only applies to entities receiving f edefal financial assistance. Identical bills to create \"The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989\" were introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representa- tives on May 9, 1989. S. 933 was approved by the Senate on Sep- tember 7, 1989, by a vote of 76-8. In the House, H.R. 2273 has been approved by the Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, Public Works and Transportation, and Judiciary committees. The ADA was a key recommen- dation of the National Council on the Handicapped in its 1986 report, Toward Independence. Its purpose is to: provide a clear and comprehen- sive national mandate to end discrimination against individuals with disabilities; provide enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities; and, ensure that the federal govern- ment plays a central role in enforcing these standards on behalf of individuals with disabilities. The term \"disability\" is defined as a physical or mental impair- ment that substantially limits one or more of a person's major life activities, a record of such impair- ment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. This is the same definition used in sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation 5 Act and the Fair Housing Amend- ments Act. Key Provisions Among its key provisions, the ADA: prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in areas such as employment. housing, public accommodations, travel, commu- nications, and activities of state and local governments. \"ADA will be a land- mark first civil rights law for people with disabilities by any major nation. n -Justin Dart, Jr., Chairman President's Committee on Employment of People with Dlsabllltles covers employers engaged in commerce who have 15 or more employees; public accommoda- tions; transportation companies; those engaged in communica- and local govern- ments. specifically defines discrimina- tion, including various types of intentional and unintentional exclusion; segregation; inferior or less effective services, benefits, or activities; architectural, transpor- tation. and communication barriers; failing to make reason- able accommodations; and dis- criminatory qualification and performance standards. calls for the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compli- ance Board to issue minimum guidelines for accessibility of buildings, facilities, vehicles, and rolling stock.

The purpose of the survey was to identify general patterns and trends with respect to the provision of acces- sible transit services for people with disabilities. The survey was designed to elicit information on the types of accessible services provided in the community and the extent to which fixed-route bus services are accessible to wheelchair users. The survey questions were developed to find out whether transit systems have an official policy to purchase fixed-route buses with lifts and whether they have projected target dates for making fixed-route bus fleets fully accessible. Other questions were developed to obtain data on the following: annual and average weekday ridership for people with dis- abilities including wheelchair users; the annual cost of maintaining lifts for fixed-route bus service; the annual budget for all para- transit services; the percentage of each system's total operating bus budget de- voted to lift maintenance and paratransit services respec- tively; the system's fare policy for people with disabilities using fixed-route bus and paratransit services; marketing techniques and tools; and information on major unmet needs, problems, inno- vations, and accomplishments in providing accessible serv- ices. Four types of transit agencies were contacted: 1. Sixty-two systems with a high percentage of accessible fixed- route buses: Project ACTION Update 2. Twenty systems with low per- centages of active fleets with lifts or ramps; 3. Transit systems serving the ten largest cities by population in the United States and 11 systems serving other major cities; 4. Twenty-eight rural transit agencies. The following is a summary of the major findings. Systems with a high percentage 1 of accessible fixed-route buses. Forty-seven of 62 systems have adopted a policy to purchase fixed-route buses with lifts. Of these 47 systems, 27 have established target dates for achieving full fixed-route acces- sibility. Fifty-five systems indicate that 50 percent or more of their fleets are equipped with lifts or ramps. Thirteen of these sys- tems have equipped all of their fixed-route buses with lifts. Annual lift usage figuresfor systems having both acces- sible fixed-route and paratransit report that paratransit continues to play a substantial role in carrying wheelchair users. The City of Seattle reported 139,000 lift uses over a 12- month period and leads all sys- tems in terms of annual lift usage. Data on annual lift usage and total disability ridership for systems with accesssible fixed- 6 The mostfrequently reported problems were the unreliabil- ity of accessible fixed-route lifts, and the cost and time in- volved in maintain- ing the lifts. route and paratransit services suggest that a high percentage of total disability ridership for paratransit is composed of wheelchair users. Annual lift usage figures for systems having both accessible fixed-route and paratransit report that paratransit contin- ues to play a substantial role in carrying wheelchair users. Of the 14 systems providing such data, 11 report annual lift usage figures for paratransit far in excess of figures for accessible fixed-route services. One additional system reported paratransit annual lift usage figures only slightly higher than those for accessible fixed-route services. Two systems, Denver Regional Transit District, and Riverside Transit Agency, reported annual lift usage figures for accessible fixed-route services higher than those for paratran- sit services. Twenty-seven systems reported that a 50 percent discount fare is in effect all the time. Four systems reported that the 50 percent discount fare is limited to off-peak hours. The most frequently reported problems were the unreliability of accessible fixed-route lifts, and the cost and time involved in maintaining the lifts. The second most frequently reported problem dealt with the difficulties encountered by Spring 1990 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 90 of 191\\ ' \\ ' transit systems in securing passengers who use power wheelchairs or the three- wheeler Amigo on accessible fixed-route buses. Systems with low 2 percentages of active fleets with lifts or ramps. Four, or 20 per- cent, have adopted a policy to purchase accessible fixed-route buses with lifts. Of these four sys- tems, three have established target dates for achieving fully- accessible fixed-route service. Nineteen of the 20 systems report few or no lifts on their fixed-route bus fleets. All 20 systems rely heavily on paratransit services for trans- porting persons with disabili- ties. Many systems re- ported that the de- mandfor paratran- sit services either exceeds or matches capacity. Many systems reported that the demand for paratransit services either exceeds or matches ca- pacity. Seven have opted to charge 50 percent discount fares all the time. 3 Systems serving the ten largest cities by popula- tion In the United States and sys- tems serving other major cities. Fifteen systems, or 75 percent, have adopted a policy to pur- chase fixed-route buses with lifts. Of these, only seven have established a target date for achieving full fixed-route accessibility. Of the 15 systems with 100 Spring 1990 Data on annual lift usage and total disability ridership for systems with accessible fixed- route and paratransit services suggest that a high percentage of total disability ridership for paratransit is composed of wheelchair users. percent lift purchase policies, six have equipped 50 percent or more of their fleets with lifts. Data on annual lift usage and total disability ridership for systems with accessible fixed- route and paratransit services suggest that a high percentage of total disability ridership for paratransit is composed of wheelchair users. Similarly, data on systems having both accessible fixed- route and paratransit services further suggest that paratransit continues to play an important role in carrying wheelchair users. Eight, or 42 percent. provide 50 percent discount fares all the time. The most frequently reported problems were that: lifts are unreliable, and maintenance is costly and time consuming; bus stops are not accessible; there are insufficient funds to meet paratransit expenses; and demand exceeds paratransit capacity. 4 Rural transit agencies. Nine of the 28 rural transit agen- cies have estab- lished a policy to buy fixed-route buses with lifts. Three systems have established target dates for achieving full fixed-route accessibility. Nine have equipped 50 percent or more of their fixed-route fleets with lifts, but one reports that none of its lifts are work- ing because of heavy snow conditions. Paratransit service plays a 7 significant role for rural transit systems. Many paratransit services are open to the gen- eral public. The share of total annual operating bus budgets devoted to paratransit service approximates, on the average, 25 percent. Where outreach and marketing programs exist, they typically include such activities as ad- vertising, presentations to local disability organizations, and demonstration training on the use of lifts. Twelve, or 50 percent, reported a policy of charging regular fares. Eight systems. or 33 percent of the systems providing data, re- ported a policy to charge 50 percent discount fares all the time. Paratransit service plays a significant role for rural transit systems. Many para- transit services are open to the general public. The most frequently reported problem was that the demand for paratransit services exceeds the capacity to provide such services. Systems also reported that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of providing paratransit services. Copies of the complete survey results are available for a nominal fee from the Project ACTION Office. Project ACITON Update This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 91 of 191Demonstration Projects (from page 11 persons with disabilities. The demand for accessible public transit services for persons with disabilities is growing and will continue to grow in the future. Also, needs are changing over time. Developments such as deinstitutionalization, independ- ent living, mainstreaming, gains in employment, education, and community integration of persons with disabilities are all working to increase the overall demand for this service. Demographic changes in the American population and ongoing activities in society promise to further emphasize the need for accessible mass transportation. A diversified collection of tools will be required to meet this growth in demand. Easter Seals believes that prog- ress in transit for persons with disabilities is most effective at the local level. New solutions for pro- viding this needed service will be found within individual communi- ties. National organizations, federal and private, can help, but they help best when they plant the impetus for innovation at the local level. It is especially important that innovations at the community level be accelerated because new, more cooperative policies will help Easter Seals believes that progress in transit for persons with disabilities is most effective at the local level. New solutions for providing this needed service will be found within indi- vidual communities. usher in more effective services across the country. and policy innovations inevitably lead the way for more effective research and technological developments. Steering Committee The steering committee is the policy review and oversight arm of Project ACTION. The steering committee is national in perspec- tive, broadly representative, and deeply involved in all aspects of the project. It participates in the review of products that are devel- oped and will approve the design and implementation of the dem- onstration programs. (See page 2 for a list of the organizations on the Project ACTION steering committee.) Resource Council There were many national and local organizations and institu- tions that desired to serve on the steering committee, but because of costs, logistics, and the need for the decision making process to flow smoothly, membership had to be limited. In order to ensure that the project was not denied the useful input of any organiza- tion or group which can contrib- ute to it, we organized a resource council. The resource council members are part of the information stream, regularly receiving mate- rials and having discussions with project staff on relevant experi- ences and efforts. All members of the resource council will receive the Project ACTION newsletter and a request for proposals. Requests for Proposals The heart of Project ACTION is a demonstration of new policy initiatives and technologies that can significantly advance and improve the status of public transportation for persons with disabilities and how the process of cooperation can help bring them about. The first step in that direction will be the development of a request for proposals docu- ment (RFP). Critical Needs Assessment Highlights of Project ACTION The initial step in the process of developing the RFP has been a review of the major needs which must be met to remove barriers to accessibility in the transit and disability communities. This has been completed and includes: Creation of a steering commit- tee to oversee the general policy of the program, and a resource council, to assist the steering committee. Development of a request for proposals (RFP) to demonstrate cooperative tools, techniques, and strategies for transit au- thorities and persons with disabilities to work together to improve access to public trans- portation. Project ACTION Update Implementation of demonstra- tion programs in communities which will use cooperation as the foundation for policy and technology initiatives. Presentation of a national public education program com- posed of materials, brochures, and public service announce- ments as well as dissemination of summary documents based on the project experiences. 8 a review of recent literature; interviews with steering committee members and other leading experts; a questionnaire to the resource council; a reconnaissance survey of transit systems. A critical needs assessment emerged from this effort in which the unfulfilled goals in this field were organized by type, priority, potential for accomplishment and other relevant factors. Spring 1990 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 92 of 191Innovation Analysis With the critical needs assess- ment as a foundation, we then proceeded to develop an innova- tnm analysis. This represents an intensive review of what has actually worked in real life experi- ence in communities across the country. The focus was on: why they have succeeded: which elements could be repli- cated in other communities: where have innovations been attempted but fallen short of expectations and why. The innovation analysis, when compared to the critical needs assessment provided the basis for construction of the RFP. Solicitation of Proposals Following the two levels of analysis outlined above, a RFP has been developed that is the basis for the design, solicitation, and acceptance of demonstration programs. Project ACTION will solicit proposals from interested organizations to be a demonstra- tion community. Members of Project ACT10N's steering committee reviewed plans for demonstra- tion projects at their meeting In Washington, D.C. on February 23, 1990. campaign to familiarize the general public and interested parties with the importance of access to public transit for people with disabilities. Public service announcements, At the end of the project, the Communications Department of Easter Seals will undertake a national public education campaign to famil- iarize the general public and interested par- ties with the importance of access for people with disabilities to public transit. Selection of communities as demonstration sites will be a col- laborative effort with guidance given by the steering committee. A \"host organization\" will be sought to be the prime sponsor of proj- ects in each community. Based on design factors and criteria, the project staff will evaluate propos- als that are submitted and make funding decisions. (See page 11 for the RFP announcement.) Public Education and Publications At the end of the project, the Communications Department of Easter Seals will undertake a national public education Spring 1990 brochures, and other forms of media will be used to sensitize the public and policy makers to the importance of the goals of the project. Meetings Meetings will be the second major outlet for products result- ing from the demonstration pro- grams and overall project experi- ences. At the conclusion of the demonstrations, we will sponsor a meeting on \"Innovation and Cooperation in Transportation of Persons with Disabilities.\" The meeting will share the ex- perience of the demonstrations 9 with a wide audience composed of providers, users, and interested third parties, and will help gener- ate broad public understanding that cooperation and innovation in this field is possible. Successful Demonstrations The demonstrations under- taken as part of the project will be critical because they will stand as the specific evidence of workable programs at the local level. Although the demonstration ac- tivities will be in specific sites, their greatest value lies in the fact that they will generate national useful data and techniques which can be replicated at any level. Great care will be taken to ensure that a representative sampling of communities and situations are chosen for the sites to ensure long-term relevance. Aside from demonstrations and the products that result from them, it is the strong hope of Easter Seals that among Project ACTION's best results will be the permanent improvement of relationships between the public transportation community and organizations representing people with disabilities at both the na- tional and local levels.

The Capital Metro Board of Directors recom- mended disregarding a policy restricting three- and four- wheeled carts, used by some people with mobility impairments, from boarding Capital Metro buses. Although the policy will not change, these riders now will be allowed to ride the buses. Pittsburgh Marks Purchase of First Lift-Equipped Buses Marietta, Georgia. the Cobb Transit System, which began operation this summer, is the first in the country to be 100 percent accessible from the start of operations. Vancouver, Washington. Twenty C-Tran buses on general routes will be equipped with wheelchair lifts. The transit system's board is acting in com- pliance with an order by Clark County Superior Court. The ruling applied to all new buses. However, the C-Tran board's decision affects only the 20 buses it has on order now. New Castle, Indiana. The New Castle on Wheels Transit System recently participated in the Pas- senger Assistance Technique training course which is prepared The Port Authority of Al- legheny County has approved the purchase of 120 new buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. These buses, manufactured by Bus Industries of America, Inc. at a total contract price of ap- proximately $24.20 million, will become the first wheelchair lift- equipped buses in PAT's history. \"More and more individuals who use wheelchairs have ex- pressed the need and impor- tance of being able to use PATs fixed-route bus service. \"If we are to accommodate these needs and meet the goals of public transit, which include providing freedom of mobility, then the time for wheelchair lift- and supplied by the Transporta- tion Management Associates of Fort Worth, Texas. Drivers were taught the basic characteristics of major functional losses and how properly to assist passengers with disabilities. Worcester, Boston Join Forces on Wheelchair Restraints The Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRrA) and the Massa- chusetts Bay Transportation Au- thority (MBTA) have joined forces to provide persons with disabili- ties in the Worcester area with the latest technology to secure wheelchairs on the WRrA buses. The Universal Belt Restraint System, which allows all types of wheelchairs to be secured prop- erly, was designed by an MBTA engineer and is being installed by workers at the MBTA repair shop in Everett. WRrA, which has buses similar to MBTA, saw the specially- designed restraints as the perfect solution for accommodating all types of wheelchairs on the 19 Project ACTION Update lift-equipped buses in its fleet. WRrA approached MBTA to install the restraints since the MBTA had the know-how and the production facility for making the modifications and for installing them. \"This is a perfect example of how two transit agencies can work together to improve accessi- bility to public transportation for people with disabilities, and save taxpayers' money in the process,\" said MBTA General Manager Thomas P. Glynn. The Universal Belt Restraint System uses two belts to secure wheelchair passengers, one to lock the chair, and the other for the passenger. 10 equipped buses in Allegheny County has come,\" said PAT Executive Director William W. Millar. According to Millar, the buses would be used to comple- ment PATs Access Program, the door-to-door advance reseivation service for the elderly and per- sons with disabilities in Al- legheny County that is spon- sored by PAT and provided by independent carriers. The per-vehicle bid price from Bus Industries of America was $201,726 including $13,766 for the cost of the wheelchair lift. The buses will seat approxi- mately 44 passengers and accommodate two wheelchairs. Toledo, Ohio. The Toledo Area Regional Transit Authority (TARfA) recently kicked off its training program aimed at reach- ing potential accessible line service riders. The program, which informs wheelchair users of TARfA's new accessible line service, is offering home bus demonstrations. TARfA personnel will take a lift-equipped bus to individual homes and explain how to use the lift, how to read the bus schedules, and answer any questions on the accessible line service. Chicago, IDinois. The Chicago Transit Authority plans to begin operating the first of 761 buses with wheelchair lifts in Septem- ber, 1990, and have lift vehicles on every bus route within two years. Detroit, Michigan. The Detroit Department of Transportation offers scheduled wheelchair accessible service on all bus routes on Saturdays and Sun- days. All bus routes will feature daily scheduled wheelchair acces- sible service by September.

DOT Regs ifrompage 11 rules do not require that wheel- chair lifts be retrofited onto exist- ing buses. The proposed regulation was issued in response to a law suit brought by the Americans Dis- abled for Accessible Public Trans- portation, the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, and other disability organizations. Groups representing people with disabilities praised the announcement and a spokesman for the American Public Transit Association said that bus compa- nies are prepared for it. The proposed rules-expected to become final later this year after a 60-day period for public com- ment-would match many of the requirements of the ADA pending in Congress. The proposed regula- tions require that: all new vehicles used for fixed- route service must be accessible.

BRADSHAW, Secretary -Treasurer July 9, 1990 The Honorable Robert Dole United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Senator Dole: DON CAMERON , Executive Director I am writing on behalf of the two million-member National Education Association to urge you to vote for passage of the conference report on s. 933, the Americans with Disabilities Act. NEA also opposes any motions to recommit the conference report or other procedural motions to delay passage. The ADA is urgently needed to ensure that the 43 million Americans with disabilities will no longer be unfairly discriminated against in employment, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications services. NEA also opposes the House-passed Chapman amendment which was deleted by the conferees. As you know, this amendment would allow employers to discriminate against individuals who work in food handling jobs, even if they are not presenting a health or safety threat to others. NEA members who work in school cafeterias could be adversely affected by this provision. NEA believes allowing discrimination based on perceptions is unconscionable and runs counter to the basic purpose of the ADA. We believe the conference bill completely ensures that employers do not have to accommodate those persons --in any profession -- who present a heal th or safety threat to others. The Chapman amendment is unnecessary and harmful, and we urge you to reject any attempts to reinstate it. Votes associated with this issue may be included in NEA's Legislative Report Card for the lOlst Congress.

The UFCW believes that you should reject appeals to fear and AIDS hysteria which are behind the efforts to pass this discriminatory language. The National Restaurant Association, the major proponent of the Chapman amendment, has circulated a letter to Congress citing reasons why you should support the Chapman language. The NRA raises a number of points that should be addressed prior to a final vote on this issue. THE CHAPMAN FOOD HANDLER AMENDMENT LANGUAGE \"It shall not be a violation of this Act for an employer to refuse to assign or to continue to assign any employee with an infectious or communicable disease of public health significance to a job involving food handling, provided that the employer shall make reasonable accommodation that would offer an alternative employment opportunity for which the employee is qualified and for which the ~mployee would sustain no economic damage.\" THE NRA SAYS: \"The Chapman amendment is a tightly crafted legislative product that will affect relatively few workers.\" UFCW RESPONSE: The Chapman amendment is a loosely drafted piece of legislation that covers nearly 13 million jobs involved in food handling out of a total national employment of nearly 100 million. Industries employing just under 30 percent of all workers would be affected by the Chapman language. (Bureau of Labor Statistics; see attached). The amendment's scope is not limited to food borne or airborne illnesses. The \"infectious or communicable disease ( s) of public health significance\" which the amendment targets, goes far beyond HIV infections. It would even cover food handlers with Lyme disease, herpes, cervical cancer, or toxic shock syndrome. William H. Wynn International President '\"~' Jerry Menapace International Secretary-Treasurer United Food & Commercial Workers International Union , AFL\u00b7CIO & CLC 1775 K Street 20006-1598 (202) 223-3111 FAX (202) 466-1 562 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 98 of 191THE NRA SAYS: A restaurant owner cannot fire HIV-positive individuals .... Even if there are no other positions currently open, the restaurant owner must make a reasonable accommodation to the HIV-positive employee. UFCW RESPONSE: Under the \"undue hardship\" standard of the ADA, if the reasonable accommodation is \"an action requiring significant difficulty or expense\" the accommodation need not be made by the employer. This means that the covered employee could be legally fired! Even the NRA ADMITS that the \"undue hardship\" standard is indeed THE limiting factor on employee protections under the Chapman amendment. Yet, they obfuscate its impact by arguing that \"this clause applies to every disability cov~red under the ADA .... \" BUT, by definition, the ADA -absent Chapman -does not consider food handlers who have \"infectious or communicable disease{s) of public health significance\" as having a disability. And indeed -absent Chapman -the livelihood of these food . handlers would not be jeopardized by the \"undue hardship\" standard. Under Chapman, however, food handlers with \"infectious or communicable disease { s) of public heal th significance\" -such as herpes, Lyme disease, or AIDS, etc. -are singled out for discriminatory treatment with no reference to whether they pose a direct threat to public health or safety. The National Restaurant Association admits that the Chapman language \"includes diseases which have not been proven to be transmittable through food -like AIDS.\" Under the ADA, these food handlers would not be part of the target population of the ADA. A food handler with Lyme disease, for example, does not suffer from discrimination because of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, etc., as contemplated in the bill. The Chapman language would jeopardize the jobs of all food handlers no matter what their medical status because it leaves to the whim of an employer to define who is a covered food handler and whether or not a \"reasonable accommodation\" of alternative employment is or is not an \"undue hardship . \" THE NRA SAYS: For some diseases, the Chapman language is redundant; but for others, like AIDS, it is not. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 99 of 191UFCW RESPONSE: Where there is no direct threat to the public, such as in the case of a food handler with AIDS, the Chapman language is not redundant because it is NOT relevant. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, Louis w. Sullivan, M.D., \"relaxing the anti-discrimination protection for food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the protection of the public health.\" THE NRA SAYS: \"Rejecting this amendment, removing flexibility from the $ystem, and limiting the options of employers will ultimately harm those that the amendment's opponents are seeking to help.\" UFCW RESPONSE: The NRA's support for the Chapman language on the grounds that opposition \"will ultimately harm those that the amendment's opponents are seeking to help\" is disconcertingly reminiscent of arguments which the NRA used to oppose the public accommodations section of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and to oppose the Act's creation of the Fair Employment Practices Commission. At that time, the NRA stated the following in a letter to Representative Andrews of Alabama: \"The public accommodations feature of the bill and the establishment of a Fair Employment Practices Commission provide no meaningful guarantee of constitutional rights. Instead, by subjecting private business to unnecessary harassment and by enabling the Federal Government to exert more control over individual rights and over private business, the proposals, if enacted, can only result in the elimination of free enterprise and of the rights and freedoms of all citizens.\" (\"Congressional Record,\" February 5, 1964 page 1996, Vol. 110, part 2, 88th Congress, 2nd session.) Interestingly, the NRA argues in its recent letter to Congress relative to the Chapman amendment that \"parallels to earlier civil rights debates\" are not apt, in part, because \"a retail establishment with black clerks could stay in business; a restaurant with a chef with AIDS cannot.\" This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 100 of 191- 4 - Yet, in 1964, the NRA argued that passage of the Civil Rights Act's public accommodations section and its creation of a Fair Employment Practices Commission could \"only result in the elimination of free enterprise.\" THE NRA SAYS: Perception is also reality in other areas of public law.... Ethics- laws for both federal workers and members of Congre ss are regularly approved because of the need to avoid even the sug9e stion of impropriety. UFCW RESPONSE: Ethics laws perceptual problem. deter and penalize potentially harmful, are not regularly enacted to avoid a mere On the contrary, ethics laws are enacted to behavior which is, in fact, harmful or to the public interest. WHAT THE NRA DOES NOT SAY: The Chapman food handler language will litigious atmosphere in the workplace. It presents a problems leading to instability in labor-management These include, but are not limi~ed to the following: create a complex of relations. o How is an infected employee to be identified? o What are the employer's obligations with respect to testing \"food handling\" employees? o What are the employer's potential liabilities in the event that the employer is unable to provide the employee with alternative employment? What are the employer's liabilities if he retains a covered employee in the food handling job? What are the employer's liabilities if he retains a covered employee in any other capacity? The UFCW strongly urges you to oppose the inclusion of the Chapman Food Handler language in the Americans With Disabilities Act.

That ls, can we assure em- ployers that they will not face litiga- tion under the ADA by current users of illegal drugs nnd alcohol? Mr. HARKIN. Let me state 1:t as clcar!y as I can. Users of Illegal drugs, Including those addicted to Ulegal drugs, a!e not protected by the ADA, regardless of wi1ether lhe employee or appllcnnt Is otherwl:re quallfled and the employee ls meeting performance standard5. The technical amendment with re- spect to Illegal drugs and nlcohol was made to remove any question about the meaning of the statutory lan- guage. Although ma.'ly or us believe that the language of the blll, as re- ported, wa.s clear, others criticized the bill as being too vague with.respect to the Issue of the use of illegal drugs. The new language assures employers that they need not worry about having to defend actions brought by casual drug users, who are not covered under the act. The act doe3 protect drug ad\u00b7 diets w}lo are not current users. And we all agree that people who use con- trolled substances under medical SU\u00b7 pervision, are unatfected by this provi- sion of the act. With respect to drug testing, the ADA explicitly states that nothing In the act prohibits or restricts either drul\" testing or emplo:vment decisions taken on the basis of such drug tests. Therefore, an applicant who Is tested and not hired because of a positive test result !or illegal drUga, or an em- ployee who Is tested and Is fired be- cause of a positive test result foe ille- gal drugs, does not have a cause of action under the ADA. If an employer performed a test -which actually meas- ured the current use or llleg-rJ drugs and the test was positive for the use ll- leg-a.l drugs, the applicant or employee has no protection under the ADA. It ts not a question of the employer having a defense In an action by the applicant or employee. The employer needs no such defense because the applicant or the employee has no cause of 11.Ction. So, I think we can assure the Sena.- tor and employers, without hestita- tion, that ernplt>yers will !ace liti- gation un.:ler the ADA on the pr.rt of current users of illegal drugs and alco- hol either !or tCi;t!ng Mr. AaM8TRONG .

It ls important that both the em- ployers and businesses and the handi- capped fully understand this legisla- tion, once It Is passed, If it Is to be im- plemented. So that ls precisely what the amendment does. It will enable the resJ;>Onsible Federal agencies to es- tablish a strong- Oovernmentwide technical assistance program. Such a program will help to educate the public about the requirements of this bill. Entitles In the private sector need to be a~are of what aocommodatlons are both necessary and cost eftective. as well as what Is the best suited for par- ticular disabled individuals.

This amendment is particularly threatening because the ADA definition of disability includes people who are 11regarded as having a physical or mental impairment\", Therefore, employers will be allowed to legally discriminate against anyone whom they reg. a rd as having such a communicable disease, regardless of the validity of their assumption. For example, it may allow an employer to deny a food-handling job to a person who has had polio if the employer regar._d . $ that person as having a communicable disease. As some of us remember, the Department of Justice under Reagan attempted a similar, but ill-fated strategy in proposing a rule that concerned communicable diseases, Lastly, the ADA has other safeguards against people with disabilities being in jobs if they present a direct threat to the health and safety of themselves or others.

If the Chapman amendment is accepted, I will recommend to my board that KCDC oppose the ADA and I will encourage all others to do likewise. If you agree, please let the conference committee know.

Should the Senate vote on the Conference Report before the House, It Is our understanding that Senator Helms wl I I make a motion to recommit the bl I I In order to reinstate the Chapman amendment that was deleted In Conference. We strongly oppose this amendment and urge you to vote against the motion to recommit. This amendment Is not needed to protect the pub I le health and was rlghtly dropped by the House and Senate conferees. The final Conference Report states clearly that any person with a conrnunlcable or Infectious disease who poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others wl I I not be covered. Therefore, a food handler with a disease that can be spread through food or beverages would not be protected by the ADA. The ADA clearly specifies that the determination of risk to others must be based on current objective pub I le health standards. The Chapman amendment would substitute the fears and prejudices of an Ignorant publ le for these standards. The supporters of the Chapman Amendment admit there Is no scientific evidence that HIV Infection can be transmitted via food or beverages but state that persons with HIV Infection should be excluded from food handl Ing Jobs because the publ le bel leyes that they pose a risk. such reasoning Ignores the Intent of the ADA, which Is to el lmlnate discrimination based on Irrational fears and false bel lefs. Rather than counteracting such Ignorance and fear with facts and reassurance, passage of the ADA with the Chapman Amendment would send a messag~ to the American people that their fears are Justified. This message contradicts the Information provided by our pub I le health officials that you cannot get AIDS by casual contact--lncludlng eating food prepared by a person with HIV Infection. 1200 Seventeenth Street, N.W.

Given your outstanding record of leadership on behalf of person& with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities, I feel confident we can count on your support. I was recently informed that the Shriver center and l<TJ submitted applications to the Institute in this fiscal year, which fell into the 0approved, but unfunded\" category; these applications were required as part of a broader national competition initiated by NICHD some years ago. Conse~uently, if they do not compete successfully in the next peer review cycle, both of these centers will be phased out by the end of FY 1991. Furthermore, as I understand it, the Shriver Center and the KU program will be competing directly against the MRRCs at both Boston Children's Hospital and the University of Wisconsin for only two funding slots in the F':l 1991 competition (along with other prominent universities from across the United States). I consider the loss of any of these existing centers to be unacceptable. rt requires years of investment to develop a high quality research infrastructure, all of which would ba lost without addi tiona 1 support. Moreover, the national network of MRRCs have made extraordinary contributions to our Nation's efforts to prevent mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. For example, their most well known research achievement was the discovery of Fetal Alcohol syndrome in the mid-19701s and the development of techniques designed to prevent it. In addition, phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that previously caused irreversible mental retardation in thousands of Americans, is now entirely preventable with a simple dietary supplement. ln fact, the vast majority of states (including Kansas, Iowa and Massachusetts) now require PKU testing at birth using a screening method also devised by the MRRCs. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 115 of 191RAURP I L-L-L-'-''-'' I L-1' '--.J.._,, I I In view of this outstanding record as well as the exciting new research that the Shriver Center and KU are now pursuing in the areas of gene therapy and molecular biology, I urge thca creation of two additional MRRCs in F\u00a5 1991 at a total cost of $1. 5 million. Using this method, we dramatically increase the prospects of retaining all the centers now at risk. However, I do not favor earmarking federal dollars for the speoif ic institutions. I have great respect for the quality of research conducted at KU and the Shriver Center. If the two additional funding slots are created for the upcoming competition, I am very confident that both these MRRCs will submit successful applications. In closing, let me also point out that for the last three consecutive fiscal years, NICHD has issued Profe~~ional Judgment Budgets calling for an increase in the number of these centers. Clearly the Institute itself acknowledges the interest of nationally recognized universities in mental retardation research and the scientific merit of the existing centers. \u00b1n my view, federal policy should encourage both strong competition within as well as the growth of the MRRC network. Because you are one of the Senate's leading voices on behalf of persons with developmental disabilities, I know that you will give this request every consideration.

Your vote against the Helms motion will be an important vote against bigotry and irrational fear. HHS poses others As Congressman John Lewis, so eloquently argued on the House Floor, \"The Chapman amendment seeks to divide us, to segregate us, to discrim- inate against us.\" A vote for the Helms motion to instruct would be a vote to foster the very type of irrational discrimination that the Americans with Disabilities Act is intended to eliminate.

I am sure the last few weeks have been tough for you. On the one hand, in your position as Minority Leader, you have had to accommodate members of your party who are not advocates of a strong ADA. On the other hand, I know you have also received some harsh criticism from disability rights advocates who may not fully understand the intricacies of Senate rules and procedures (I must admit at times I find them are a bit confusing myself) as well as you do ,Senator. Throughout all this turmoil you have steadfastly stood in support of the ADA and I, for one, am extremely greatful that you are on our side.

The majority of ADA advocates believe that the protection provided in the bill for congressional employees should be equal in both houses. We wan~ only the recourse that is afforded other protected minorities. We are not asking for favoritism, but equality. The main concern in the disability community is that the Chapman Amendment will once again rear it's monstrous head. In the words of Liz Savage, one of the leading lobbyists for the ADA, \"vJe feel ... that this amendment is so antithetical to the whole bill that the disability community couldn't support the bill with the amendment in it\". It would be a terrible waste for the president, members of Congress and disability rights activists to come this far only to lose it all because of this one amendment. Therefore, I urge you to work for swift resolution of the Grassley Amendment in the Senate and a compromise that will still have the support of the very people this bill was designed to protect. k<Wl Kevin Siek R.R. 5, Box 1818 Lonestar KS 66046 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 122 of 191'UoPEKA @NDEPENDENT ~IVING ~ESOURCE ~NTER, @NC.

Being the strongest disability related legislation ever prepared in this country, we find it to be a very volatile subject at times. I know that many disability organizations have chosen to force you into a very uncomfortable, and in my opinion, unwarranted position. I want to make sure you know that there are many of out here that very much appreciate your strong but cautious approach to the passage of the ADA. After all, none of us wants the wrong piece of legislation passed either. In fact, the man who would put their name on a document without arguing its content or intent would be foolish.

Siehndel, Secretary I spoke to Senator Dole's office and _recommended that the ADA be held back from the House in order that the coverage of the Senate and House under the Grassley amendment can be made equal through limited debate on the Senate floor. I intend to make that recommendation to the Kansas congressional delegation and the leadership of both chambers. I do not believe Dole is delaying the ADA as do advocates in Washington DC; I think he is saving it. Read the congressional record. If you do not have a copy, contact me at the address or phone# above. Whether intentional or not, the fact is the Grassley amendment wi 11 prove to be the 11 Ki 11 er Amendment 11 for the ADA. The private right of action for Senate staff was included in the coverage for the Senate, even though such a provision has NEVER been allowed by the Senate in its entire history. Can we seriously think that the Senate is willing to dump its sacrosanc~ This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 125 of 191-2/4- immunity for a 11bunch of gimps11 when they have never afforded such protection to other, better organized, better financed and politically more powerful groups? (If so, would you like to buy a little seaside property in Utah?) Then, Orrin Hatch signed off on the conference committee report, complete with the Grassley amendment. After that, Hatch opposed the provision ,for the private rigbt of action, claiming a staff member had misinformed him. He is now adamantly refusing to move the bill until some solution is worked out. Several questions arise out of this scenario: (1) Was Grassley really seeking to protect disabled employees of the Senate or was he grandstanding while sabotaging the ADA? (2) Did Orrin Hatch really sign onto the report without knowing what he was doing? [It worked for Reagan.] (3) Why doesn't the democrat Majority Leader George Mitchell, do something? Most Iowans know Grassley has a continuing feud with Tom Harkins. Both are Senators from Iowa. Grassley uses every opportunity to try to make Harkins look bad. I believe Grassley knew the effect of his amendment. He certainly knew that it was previously rejected when S. 933 was being considered in the Senate. Did he really expect the Senate to change its mind? This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 126 of 191-3/4- Did Hatch really sign off on the conference committee report without knowing what was in it? I think Hatch knew what he was doing. He's has been around long enough to know what he is signing, particularly if he was taking part in discussions on the ADA as a conference committee member. Further, despite his conservative bent, Hatch is a pretty smart cookie, as witnessed in his debates of othe~ topics on \"McNeil-leherer\" for instance. By his action, he has placed Senator Dole in an untenable situation. Dole must either release the report to the house and, by so doing, guarantee bipartisan rejection of the ADA in the Senate if the house approves the conference report. Why isn't Mitchell doing something? Maybe he would if he weren't getting a free ride on this one. I would be interested in knowing if any of his constituents have contacted him to ask his position on the ADA conference committee report and the Grassley amendment. If he supports the report, then he should be moving the bill. I'll bet he's not. No senatorial majority, regardless of party affiliation, truly wants the private right of action. It's easier to blame the opposing party. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 127 of 191-4/4- Regardless of this scenario's validityf the effect will be the same: ADA becomes, not the Americans with Disabilities Act, just Another Dead Act. If this makes sense to you, I invite you to contact the leadership in both chambers and request the ADA be acted upon by the Senate firstl It is possible that Chapman will be again discussed, but it's easier for us to use qur limited resources to defeat it again than to start over again. I assure you that Grassley will make that option our only other choice. \\q This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 128 of 191July 9, 1990 THE CHAPMAN AMENDMENT TO THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \"FOOD HANDLING JOBS.--lt shall not be a violation of this Act for an employer to refuse to assign or continue to assign any employee with an infectious or communicable disease of public health significance to a job involving food handling, provided .that the employer shall make reasonable accommodation that would offer an alternative employment opportunity for which the employee is qualified and for which the employee would sustain no economic damage.11 Dear Senator: On Tuesday, the conference report on the Americans With Disabilities Act is expected to be considered. At that time, a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions to accept the Chapman Foodhandling Amendment will be offered. The conference committee stripped the Chapman Amendment from its report less than three weeks after the full Senate voted to instruct them to accept the language. We urge you to support the motion to recommit with instructions. The Chapman Amendment was narrowly drafted to enable employers--not require employers--the flexibility to assign or reassign employees with infectious and communicable diseases, such as AIDS, to nonfoodhandling positions. It makes it clear that the employer must make an offer of an --alternative employment opportunity for which the employee is qualified and FOR WHICH THE EMPLOYEE WOULD SUSTAIN NO ECONOMIC DAMAGE. We feel the Chapman Amendment strikes a balance for food industry operators who must respond to current public health concerns while allowing those with infectious and communicable diseases the opportunity to continue their employment and maintain their standard of living. The Senate has already cast its vote in support of including the Chapman language as has the House of Representatives. On behalf of the millions of employers and employees we represent, we ask that you allow the democratic process to take its course and support the motion to recommit with instructions to retain this critical amendment.

Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Restaurant Association, I want to again stress the importance of the Chapman Amendment to the Americans With Disabilities Act to our industry. We urge you to support all efforts to include this language in the conference report before enacting this sweeping legislation. When the Senate convenes today, it is expected to consider the ADA conference report . At that time, a motion to recommit with instructions to accept the Chapman Amendment will be offered. This action is necessary because the conference committee stripped the Chapman Amendment from its report less than three weeks after the full Senate voted to instruct its conferees to accept the language and after the House approved the measure by a vote of 199-187. The Chapman Amendment addresses the issue of employees with infectious or communicable diseases who work in foodservice establishments. Specifically, the amendment would allow employers to move workers with communicable or infectious diseases, like AIDS, out of positions where they are handling food into alternative positions within the establishment . It makes clear that the position must be one for which the employee is qualified and FOR WHICH THE EMPLOYEE SHALL SUSTAIN NO ECONOMIC DAMAGE. Without this addition to the Amer icans with Disabilities Act, foodservice establishments throughout he nation would be faced with an impossible choice. They could either violate the Act in an effort to reassure the public about food safety, or comply with the Act and risk a dramatic loss of business that may result in bankruptcy. When bankruptcy occurs, everybody losses--the business owner, all of the employees, and particularly, the disabled individual who will no longer be able to maintain his or her standard of living. The Senate has already cast its vote in support of including the Chapman language as has the House. We urge you to let the democratic process take its course and let the Chapman Amendment become law.

NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION The Chapman food-handling amendment would allow employers to move an employee with a communicable or infectious disease of public health significance out of a food-handling position while making a reasonable accommodation of an offer of reassignment to another position for which the individual is qualified and for which the employee would sustain no economic damage. DOESN'T THE BILL ALREADY ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM? The way the bill is presently drafted, an employer could only move an employee out of a food-handling position if that employee posed a significant risk to the health and safety of others. In the case of AIDS for example, the employee would not pose a significant risk to the health and safety of others because you can not get AIDS from food, drink or casual contact. THEN WHY IS THIS AMENDMENT NECESSARY? A restaurateur's livelihood depends largely on public perception. If the public perceives a health risk --rightly or wrongly, whether or not based on ignorance or irrational fears --the damage to a business could be severe. The unfortunate reality is that there are Americans who panic at the mention of the word AIDS and would refuse to patronize any foodservice establishment if an employee were known to have the disease. For the restaurant with an employee known to have AIDS, it could very well translate into business failure --all customers would need to do is go to another establishment down the street. WHAT ABOUT OTHER COMMUNICABLE OR INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS HEPATITIS, DIPHTHERIA, MENINGITIS, ETC.? These diseases are covered under most state and/or local sanitation ordinances, most of which are based on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Food and Drug Administration manual. They require the foodservice establishment to remove that person because they pose a \"direct threat\" or \"significant risk\" to others. DOESN'T THIS AMENDMENT CONTRADICT THE GOALS OF THE ADA IN TERMS OF PROTECTING WORKERS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON AN IRRATIONAL FEAR? Inasmuch as AIDS is not a foodborne illness, this amendment would contradict the legislation. This is, however, a time when tremendous emphasis is being placed on the safety of our food. Everyday there are articles in the newspaper telling us about pesticide residues in food, what the nutrition content of our food is, and basically what is good for us and what is not. Unfortunately, there are many Americans who panic at the mention of the word AIDS and would refuse to patronize any food establishment if an employee were known to have the disease . Equal access to all is a laudable goal. There are some exceptions that have to be made, however. We must limit the number of casualties --not only the businesses themselves, but all their employees who will lose their salary and benefits if the business closes.

Contrary to the claims of the National Restaurant Association, the foodhandlers amendment wholly contradicts the spirit of the ADA by undermining the protections of the bill and perpetuating needless discrimination. The f oodhandlers amendment is based on irrational fears and misperceptions about people with AIDS and HIV disease. People with disabilities are all too familiar with such prejudicial attitudes because they have been similarly shunned by the same kinds of stereotypes. For instance, people with mental retardation have often been institutionalized based on numerous misperceptions, including the unfounded fear that this condition is contagious. In the same vein, people with polio, in other generations, were subjected to panic-induced discrimination even though this viral disease has a limited contagion period of two weeks. Because massive misperceptions about the disease persisted, individuals with the disease were isolated and segregated. Even decades after the epidemic, children with polio were separated from other children in schools and adults were denied employment. Although it's hard to believe today, the fear of epilepsy was once so great that people with this disease were believed to be possessed by the devil and were shut out of schools and the workforce. Even cancer was once thought to be contagious and resulted in discrimination. The f oodhandling amendment reinforces misperceptions about diseases that do not pose a risk to the public. It will send a message to the public that AIDS can be transmitted through food, even though this is not true. This is irresponsible. It undercuts all the public education efforts that have been spear-headed by the government over the last five years to teach people the facts about the disease. If Members of the Senate have concerns about diseases that do pose a direct threat to the health and safety of the public, they should rest assured that this has already been FORMERLY: CONSORTIUM FOR CITIZENS WITH DEVELOPMENT AL DISABILITIES This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 133 of 191addressed by the legislation. The Senate-passed version of the ADA ( s. 933) already explicitly states that any individual with a contagious disease would not receive protections under the Act if they pose a direct threat to the health and safety of other that cannot be removed by reasonable accommodation. The Senate voted to incorporate this language in the Civil Rights Restoration Act and Fair Housing Amendments Act to allay fears about the contagiousness of the disease. Proponents of the foodhandlers amendment contend that it is needed because of perceptions that HIV disease can be transmitted through the handling of food, even though they themselves admit that these perceptions are false. The ADA is intended to prohibit employment discrimination based on irrational fears and stereotypical perceptions. We strongly disagree with the National Restaurant Association's assertion that this amendment is \"fully in the spirit\" of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Persons with disabilities and their friends and families believe that the spirit of the ADA is to end discrimination based on ignorance and prejudice, not to foster it. For people with disabilities, including those with HIV disease and AIDS, the ADA offers promise that they will no longer be shunned and isolated because of the ignorance of others. We strongly urge you, on behalf of millions of citizens with disabilities, to oppose any motion to instruct on the foodhandlers amendment. Thank you.

We also urge you to oppose any procedural motion which would delay civil rights protection to over 43 million Americans with disabilities. The disabled community has waited too long for the same guaranteed rights other minorities enjoy. We cannot allow them to wait any longer. It is at this crucial point that the ADA needs your full support. Every American deserves equal treatment under the law and must not be denied access to employment, transportation, telecommunications or public accommodations based simply on a disability. Demonstrate your commitment to ensuring the rights of the disabled by supporting the ADA. Thank you for your attention to our views.

Following overwhelming votes of support from the U.S. Senate last September (76 to 8 in favor) and the House of Representatives in May (403 to 20 in favor), House and Senate conferees have resolved the differences between the two bills and you will soon be voting on the Conference Report. It is again time to vote to end discrimination based on fear, myths and stereotypes. We urge you to oppose any and a 11 procedura 1 actions that might come before the Senate which are aimed at delaying, weakening or killing ADA. Finally, we also urge you to vote for final passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act to guarantee the rights of our nation's citizens with disabilities. Passing the Americans with Disabilities Act just before all Americans celebrate Independence Day would bring about a real declaration of independence. Please support the Americans with Disabil ities Act. Forty-three mi 11 ion America ns deserve and need your vote. Thank you again for supporting our cause.

NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION The House of Representatives recently passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA} by a 403-20 margin. During House floor consideration of the ADA bill, a number of vital improvements were made to the Committee bill. These improvements add an essential degree of flexibility and sensitivity to the ADA legislation. Of special importance to the restaurant industry is the Chapman amendment, which was offered by Democratic representative Jim Chapman of Texas. The Chapman foodhandling amendment was approved --with bipartisan support --in a very close vote. Because the vote in the House was close, and because the Chapman amendment is so important to the foodservice industry, it is expected that a \"motion to instruct\" the conferees to accept the Chapman language will be made on the Senate floor this week. This motion is one of several that may be offered on outstanding issues relative to the ADA bill. The National Restaurant Association strongly urges a \"yes\" vote on the motion to instruct the conferees to accept the Chapman amendment. The Chapman amendment addresses the sensitive question of employees in the foodservice industry who have contagious or infectious diseases and who directly handle food. Specifically, the Chapman amendment modifies the previous language of the ADA bill, which prohibited employers from moving employees with certain infectious diseases out of a foodhandling position and into some other job within the establishment. Under the Chapman amendment, an employer has the option of moving an employee with an infectious or communicable disease of public health significance out of a foodhandling position and into another job within the establishment. The employee must be qualified for the position, and the employee can sustain no economic damage from the change. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 146 of 191The Chapman amendment strikes a sensitive balance in response to a real public health concern. It provides employers with the flexibility necessary to respond to these concerns, while protecting the economic and job security of employees. It should be pointed out that the restaurant industry is one of the most highly competitive industries in America. Profit margins are low, and eating alternatives are plentiful. Local consumer reactions to perceived public health risks can be swift and devastating. The Chapman amendment came about in response to the fact that numerous f oodservice establishments have been forced out of business because of public reactions to health rumors --both ill and well-founded. A policy which would force restaurants to close their doors to business and let go all of their employees because of a rigid determination of the job options of one employee simply does not make sense. We at the National Restaurant Association wish that the Chapman amendment was not needed. Because, in its definition, it includes diseases which have not been proven to be transmittable through food --like AIDS. The National Restaurant Association has long been a leader in the effort to differentiate between the facts and the fallacies of food safety. We have committed significant financial resources to this effort. The foodservice industry also has taken the lead in employing the disabled, with a greater number of disabled Americans working in the hospitality industry than in any other sector of the economy. But the fight to end ignorance and fear is far from over. While that fight continues, it is essential that protections for both employers and employees of the f oodservice industry be maintained. \u00b7 Opponents of the Chapman amendment raise a number of points which should be addressed. First is the question of whether or not this language is redundant within the context of the ADA bill, as there are already exclusions from coverage for individuals with contagious diseases which pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. For some diseases the Chapman language is redundant but for others, like AIDS, it is not. The second point opponents of the amendment make is that the Chapman amendment caters to fear, and that \"leadership and education\" are required, not this amendment. The National Restaurant Association strongly agrees that continued leadership and education are needed, and we remain committed to that goal. But to reject an amendment which allows an afflicted individual to maintain his or her job, income, and This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 147 of 191dignity to avoid \"catering to fear\" is foolish. Rejecting this amendment, removing flexibility from the system, and limiting the options of employers will ultimately harm those that the amendment's opponents are seeking to help. The third point made by opponents of this amendment draws parallels to earlier civil rights debates. Forty years ago, the argument goes, blacks were denied jobs in sales and retail establishments because of the fear that people would not shop at these stores. This type of discrimination was not right then and it is not right now. There are three big differences today. First, the Chapman amendment is about re-assigning workers, not denying them jobs. Second, people die from AIDS, so the fear is much more real. And third, a retail establishment with black clerks could stay in business, a restaurant with a chef with AIDS cannot. A final argument against the Chapman amendment is that we should be legislating based on reality, not perception. The fact is that in the restaurant industry perception is reality. Perception is also reality in other areas of public law. For example, airline pilots are subject to arbitrary, mandatory retirement ages. This is not because an older, more experienced pilot necessarily jeopardizes air safety, but because the public, rightly or wrongly, perceives that to be the case. Laws are enacted to address this current public perception. Similarly, ethics laws for both federal workers and members of Congress are regularly approved because of the need to avoid even the suggestion of impropriety. This is another area where Congress has responded to a current, strongly-held public perception. It cannot be argued that laws are not or should not be enacted based on perception. It can, however, be argued that there are instances where public perception relating to an issue, like food safety, is so important that federal policies which are sensitive to perception are needed. The Chapman amendment is a tightly crafted legislative product which will affect relatively few workers. Its enactment will not derail the ADA bill, but it will provide foodservice employers with the flexibility they need to survive. It is a sensitive approach to a delicate issue. We strongly urge a \"yes\" vote on the motion to instruct. A list of groups supporting the Chapman amendment, together representing over 750,000 small and independent businesses, is enclosed for review. I have also an article making clear the type of unfortunate incidents which could continue to happen if the Chapman amendment is not agreed to. Please vote \"yes\" on this crucial motion.

Washington, DC 20024 (202) 554-9000 FAX (202) 554-0496 The Guardian of Small Business Honorable Robert Dole United States Senate Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Bob: July 9, 1990 The intent behind the ADA bill is to provide equal access to the disabled --a worthwhile goal. While NFIB still has serious reservations about specific provisions in the bill, we will do everything possible to insure that NFIB members know their obligations under the law. However, we are deeply concerned about efforts by Congress to exempt itself from the full requirements of the ADA bill. Over the last few decades, Congress has enacted more than a dozen major statutes that have had a serious impact on American business. However, it has exempted itself from these same provisions. Until Congress has to live by the rules that it makes for others, it will never fully understand their implications. It seems particularly ironic that Congress believes businesses should be subject to penalty for not providing access to disabled customers and workers, but many members of Congress do not believe that disabled citizens should have the same access to remedies from legislators. Such a double standard is simply unacceptable. On behalf of the 500,000 members of the National Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to support Sen. Grassley's efforts to fully apply the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to Congress. Furthermore, I urge you to vote to defeat any points of order made against Congressional coverage --any such vote will be considered a Key Small Business Vote for the lOlst Congress. 1325G ohn J.

This is for your information. I hope that you will sincerely consider the very serious problem highlighted in this letter. James Canaday 006488 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 154 of 191James Canaday 1330 New Jersey st. Lawrence, KS 66044 June 13, 1990 Mr. Alex T. Langston Jr. Manager, Customer Relations AMTRAK Mr. Langston: I have just finished reading some of your correspondence exchanged earlier this year with Mrs. Becky Skinner of Garden City, Kansas. This correspondence was wholly reproduced in the May 1990 Braille Monitor, the publication of the National Federation of the Blind. I write to you now because I frequently travel via AMTRAK (even on the same Southwest Chief route ) and because I too am blind; I am incensed that your letter of January 26, 1990 implicates blindness as a causal factor in Mrs. Skinner's boarding problem! In fact, I have traveled on AMTRAK for over thirteen years (since I was sixteen), being blind for all of those years. In your second paragraph for example, you begin (quite commendably) with a direct apology. However, at the end of the very same paragraph you state: \"Should you travel with us again, provision of such advance notice should eliminate the possibility of any repetition of the incident you described.\" This highly offensive passage precedes an admission that the conductor should have inspected the side of the train before clearing it to move. The comments preceding and including this quoted sentence are absolutely spurious and imply that blindness somehow impairs train-boarding ability. No assistance of any kind could have resolved the problem Mrs. Skinner described, short of keeping the train from moving. This disregards th e fact that any one has trouble boarding a moving train, bus or auto! You should have simply left the possible blame or fault to the Conductor or other culpable crew members. Furthermore, my lengthy and varied AMTRAK experience completely disproves the suggestion tbat blindness by itself impairs train boarding An abbreviated description of my railroad passenger experience will clearly demonstrate this, beyond the dictate of common sense. I have accumulated over thirty thousand miles of AMTRAK travel, to destinations such as Lawrence, Ft. Madison (Iowa), Chicago, Sacramento, San Francisco and Salinas (California). I have ridden your Coast Starlight, Southwest Chief, Zephyr and San Joaquin routes. All of this travel has certainly included at least seventy train boardings and detrainings (your own AMTRAK word). On several occasions, I also carried heavy carry-on baqqaqe. Some This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 155 of 191and later a Guide Dog for independent travel. In all of my train travels, I have had absolutely no problem with boarding or detraining, but the trains always remained stationary until car doors firmly closed behind me. Though I have experienced generally excellent service and conditions on AMTRAK, please do not mistake this letter for a testimonial. A personal concern prods me to write to you: conceivably I could suffer a similar AMTRAK service calamity and find my blindness blamed for it, as Mrs. Skinner found in your correspondence. In this, you truly \"add insult to injury.\" I hope that this problem does not recur. Much more, I expect greater professionalism from the AMTRAK staff regarding the proper view of blind persons. My extensive experience riding AMTRAK should certainly debunk your belief in diminished train-boarding ability among the independent blind. If you desire further information on the strengths and capacities of the blind, please feel free to write to me or the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) at this address: the National Federation of the Blind 1800 Johnson st. Baltimore, MD 21230 This address also serves the Braille Monitor, should you wish to request a subscription. This publication is available in print, cassette or Braille. I look forward to tangeable signs of AMTRAK's improving attitude toward the blind.

I am writing to inform you of my support of Representative Jim Chapman's amendment to The Americans with Disabilities Act. Without this amendment hotel and restaurant owners and operators will undoubtedly lose the flexibility to transfer workers with infectious diseases out of food-handling positions. It is certain that customers will refuse to patronize establishments where it is known that employees who prepare and serve food are inflicted with such an illness. We as an industry are concerned about protecting the rights of all Americans. We can best do that by providing jobs and benefits to those in our communities.

The whirlwind of the new session, new legislation (i.e. the Civil Rights Act of 1990!), and other pressing business has prevented me from contacting you sooner as the bill was making its way through the House committees. Now that it is closer to a final package, I thought it would be useful to assess what if anything has been done to the provisions/issues of interest to Hallmark. The analysis and reference you provided to us last December regarding the Senate's bill was very helpful. We have added a few more questions to the list and any clarification or explanation you have been able to glean from the House version on these matters will be welcomed. I would suggest we get the key Hallmark people to speak with you on the phone at a convenient time if that is possible.

I have supported the ADA because I believe it is a just and fair bill which will bring equality to the lives of all Americans with disabilities. our message to America today is that inequality and predjudice will no longer be tolerated. our message to people with disabilities is that \"your time has come.'' The Americans With Disabilities Act will Americans with disabilities to exercise empower 43 million their rights and participate in the mainstream of American life. The Americans with Disabilities Act will enrich our nation by supporting the talents, skills and abilities of a minority group which has up until now been on the sidelines. we are all winners as we stand in support of this legislation. I am optimistic that this legislation will set a tone as we 1 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 165 of 191enter a new decade. Just as we have seen the walls go down in Eastern Europe, we are now witnessing some of our own walls crumbling--the walls of prejudice, isolation, discrimination and segregation. We have paid dearly for our policies of the past-- discrimination costs both in human terms and financial terms. Keeping people with disabilities out of the workforce and dependent on government subsidies is a policy of the past. Let's consider what this legislation will yield in terms of opportunities for persons with disabilities. In terms of employment it will offer accessible environments and reasonable accomodations to empower persons with disabilities to utilize their full potential in strengthening the workforce. Transportation is the critical link to employment. This bill will result in accessible public transportation to and from the work site. Living independently and with dignity means opportunity to participate fully in every activity of daily life, be it going to the movies, dining in a resaturant, cheering at a baseball game, communicating by phone or going to the doctor. The ADA offers such opportunity to persons with disabilities. The tough but fair enforcement remedies of ADA, which parallel the Civil Rights Act of 1964, are time-tested incentives for compliance and disincentives for discrimination. The technical assistance efforts mandated in ADA will support two efforts critical to the mission of ADA: 1) they will inform persons with disabilities about their rights under the law and 2) 2 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 166 of 191provide the necessary support to business and industry as they undertake the important job of implementing the law. In this legislation we have not made exceptions for any specific disability. We have included persons with mental retardation and persons with cerebral palsy, even though many people fear and misunderstand those disabilities. We have included persons who are deaf and persons who are blind, even though many people misundersatnd those disabilities. We have also included people with AIDS and other diseases, even though there is a lot of fear and misunderstanding surrounding many diseases. We have included all people with all disabilities because that's what this bill is with understanding. We about replacing misunderstanding have not said that you have to employ a person in a job they really cannot do, or in a setting where they will pose a danger to the health or safety of other people. What we have said is that these decisions must be made about individuals, not groups and must be based on facts, not fears. We have had a patch work quilt up until now an inconsistent and piecemeal approach to disability policy. Today we move to embrace the most comprehensive civil rights legislation our nation has ever seen. Today we move to put old stereotypes and attitudes behind us --where they belong. And I might add that I am especially pleased to note that for the first time in the history of this body, we are actually applying a law that we pass to ourselves! Sen. Grassley's 3 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 167 of 191amendment which makes the Americans With Disabilities Act applicable to the U.S. Congress, is an important component of this legislation. It sends a message to the small business community, the transportaion industry and other entities covered by the requirements of ADA, that we are accountable to the same standards we have set for the rest of the nation. I would like to note that this legislation is the result of hours, days and months of hard work and negotiations on both sides of the aisle and within the disability and business communitites. These negotiations represent the beginning of the important work that lies ahead as persons with disabilities join forces with business and industry to strengthen our nation's productivity and commitment to a society of equal opportunity. No individual in America embodies a commitment to equal opportunity more than President Bush. His unflagging support of the ADA and his continued eagerness to sign this legislation into law are evidence of unparalled leadership in the White House on behalf of persons with disabilities. Mr. President, we are proud that we have reached this juncture, and confidently send this legislation to your desk. In 1964 this body declared discrimination illegal and laid a civil rights foundation which we build upon today. I am reminded of Martin Luther King's challenge to our nation when he said: \"Let us not judge a man by the color of his skin, but rather by the content of his character.\" If he were alive today, I imagine he would be pleased with our efforts. Perhaps he would amend his 4 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 168 of 191challenge and ask that we not judge people on the nature of their attributes, but rather judge our society on its ability to embrace the unique contributions of each of its citizens. 5 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 169 of 191MEMBERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITlES ACT In. order to lend credence and visibility to the Commission, The Council recommends that Members of the Commission be appointed from allit>nq the ranks of the moat successful and visible in the various fields.

There is precedent for both types of commissions. The Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic (chaired by Admiral James Watkins, ret.) wos established by an ex~cutive orde~ issued by President Reagan. The National Commisaion on Children (chaired by sen. Rockefeller) was initiated by congress and established by law. The Commission should be made up of approximately 24 membe1\u00b7s. If the commission was established by executive order, the President would appoint all commissioners. If the Commision was established by law, one third should be appointed by the President, one third appointed by the Senate and one third appointed by the House. Of the House and senate appointees, half should be appointed by the majority leadership and half by the minority leadership. All appointments ehould be made in consultation with the National Com1c11 on Di.ability. In addition to persons with disabilities and family members of persons with disabilities, the Commission should include representatives from labor and management of a range of businesses, such as the hotel and restaurant industry, sports complexes, the communications industry, the transportation industry, physicians and medical facilities, state and local governments, colle9es and universities and the media. The Commission should be established as soon as possible after the enactment of ADA. commission members should be appointed promptly. The commission should be fully operational within 90 days of the enactment of ADA. The commission will meet at least four times a year and conduct site visits and hearings. The commission will function for two years, with an option for renewal at the end of the two year period. The commission shall issue an ini~ial report six months after it is established and again in one year. The final report of the Commission will be issued two years after its establishment. The recommended appropriation level for the Commissio11 is $2 million per year. These funds would be used to compensate commission members at a daily rate specified for a GS 18 of the General schedule, for travel and meeting expenses, for general operations and for a small staff.

(2) Did Orrin Hatch really sign onto the report without knowing what he was doing? [It worked for Reagan.] (3) Why doesn't the democrat Majority Leader George Mitchell, do something? Most Iowans know Grassley has a continuing feud with Tom Harkins. Both are Senators from Iowa. Grassley uses every opportunity to try to make Harkins look bad.

By his action, he has placed Senator Dole in an untenable situation. Dole must either release the report to the house and, by so doing, guarantee bipartisan rejection of the ADA in the Senate if the house approves the conference report.

I would be interested in knowing if any of his constituents have contacted him to ask his position on the ADA conference committee report and the Grassley amendment.

Harvard Ave., Okla homo C'ty, Oklahoma 7 31213 _please reply _to: 3941 Warwick Drive, Norman, OK 73072 The Honorable David L. Boren u.S . Senate 453 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510-3601 Dear David: ,June 12, 1990 +05-681-9611 We were surprised and disappointed that you supported Senator Helms init iative to incorporate the Chapman amendment in the instructions to the Senate ADA conferees . The Chapman amendment is unnecessary, probably unenforceable, and morally indefensible . (1) HHS Secretary Sullivan, CDC-Atlanta, and the AMA have all stated in writing that the Chapman amendment adds nothing to the control of infectious diseases . Under terms of the existing bill, food handlers and others who pose any disease risks to the public can already be reassigned, terminated, or denied initial employment . (2) The Chapman amendment attempts to legitimatize discrimination in the workplace based upon diagnoses of diseases even when the individuals with these diseases pose no hea'1th risk to others. For example, one of your constituents who had contracted Rocky ~ountain spotted fever could be terminated from a local restaurant job even tho1!:;h that disectse can not be transmitted to other people except by ticks. Would that stand up in a test ~f law? fndeed, the amendment is so fuzzy--critical classifications of \"communicable disease\" and \"'of public health significance\" are introduced without medical definition--that the only certain beneficiaries will be the lawyers. (3) The Chapman amendment sanctions the most facile and pernicious form of discrimination--the self-excuplatory: \"We know these people are o.k.; it' s just that others might be offended . \" Consider a parallel example. At a recent fund raising activity at a large mall complex, a young man who is severely affected by cerebra l palsy had stopped in his wheelchair at the end of the CCP booth next to the entrance of a women's lingerie shop . After a few moments the owner came out and asked one of the UCP This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 186 of 191The Honorable David L. Boren Page two volunteers to move this young man to the other end of the booth because she thought his appearance might be upsetting to her potential customers . Wrong? Of course, but that is no less offensive than the rationale that the \\ational Restaurant Association invoked in support of the Chapman amendment . Would you have us pander to the delicate sensitivities of lingerie shop owners and the latent fear and hostility that she and the ~ational Restaurant Association feel toward anyone who looks, acts, or may, in some hidden way, be different? The Chapman amendment which you endorsed says it is all right to discriminate and to exclude people from food handling and food product jobs when there is no health reason for that exclusion. I'm not surprised that the restaurateurs are willing to sacrifice the civil rights of others to their concern with profit . I had hoped for better from the U.S . Senate . There is still some hope that the ADA Conference Committee will report a final bill that sustains the basic commitment of guaranteeing the rights of persons with disabi liti es against any irrelevant and functionally unjustifiab l e discrimination. If that happens, there will almost certainly be renewed efforts to weaken and restrict this bill. Final passage of a strong ADA, indeed passage of ADA in any form, may depend upon the success of the Congressional leadership in bringing a Conference Committee bill to vote without further amendments. With this in mind, we ask two things. First, please reconsider your vote on the Chapman amendment instructions, and let the Senate conferees know that you would welcome a bill without this unnecessary baggage. Second, be prepared to give your support to a timely, amendment-free passage of a restrengthened Conference Committee Report and Bill . Please let us know your current thoughts and plans regarding these ,important matters. ' WRC/kdp Sincerely, /)~ Wm.

The Chapman amendment (which added subsection 103(d) to the House bill, H.R. 2273) gives an employer a defense against a charge of discrimination \"for an employer to refuse to assign or continue to assign any employee with an infectious or communicable disease of public health significance to a job involving food handling, provided that the employer shall make reasonable accommodation that would offer an alternative employment opportunity for which the employee is qualified and for which the employee would sustain no economic damage.\" The debate will probably focus on AIDS, but the amendment applies to any infectious or communicable disease. In the House, the debate made a critical distinction between facts and appearances. Even the amendment's advocates did not assert that AIDS can be spread by food handlers. They did assert that restaurants could be driven out of busi ness by fears that their food handlers had AIDS. (Other diseases can certainly be spread by food handlers, of course.) (((Note to RPC: This appears to be the only instructi on on which a vote will be requested.))) This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 188 of 191S. 933, the Americans With Disabilities Act THE GRASSLEY MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES The Senate-passed version of ADA (S. 933, adopted Sept. 7, 1989 by a vote of 76-to-8) contained a Grassley amendment that extended the provisions of the ADA ''in their entirety\" to each House of Congress and any instrumentality of Congress. The amendment was adopted on a division vote. 135 Cong. Rec. S 10780-82 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989). The Grassley amendment became section 509 of the Senate bill. The House made substantial changes in the Grassley amendment. See, section 509 of H.R. 2273, 136 Cong. REc. H 2652 (daily ed. May 22, 1990). In brief, the chief thrust of the House amendment seems to be that the ADA will be enforced in the House, the Capitol grounds and office buildings, and in instrumentalities of Congress by congressional officials and not through the regular administrative (i.e. executive branch) proceedings that private entities are subject to. Senator Grassley is likely to argue that by making ADA applicable to Congress but having Congress enforce the provisions of the Act against itself that Congress is once again exempting itself from the same rules that apply to everyone else in the country. All the other entities that will be covered by the Act will be subject to administrative and judicial enforcement mechanisms that will not apply to Congress. Senator Grassley will move to instruct the SEnate conferees to adopt a provision allowing aggrieved persons to sue Senators. His motion will not incorporate his original amendment but will provide a more comprehensive remedy than in the House version. (((NOTE TO RPC: Grassley will likely introduce his motion then withdraw it and have a chatty colloquy with Harkin))) This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 189 of 191Senator Boschwitz's office informs us that he will not offer a motion to instruct.
