In 2019, all 50 states saw an unprecedented outbreak of a vaping induced lung injury associated with cannabis vaping. To date, the precise cause is unknown; however, it appears that certain non- cannabis ingredients are wholly or partially responsible. While this rulemaking process is being undertaken in the aftermath of the acute lung injury outbreak, the OLCC's concerns regarding additives apply to both the potential for acute and chronic harm associated with unknown ingredients, and these concerns pre -date the outbreak. Once OLCC licensees began using additives, it became apparent that the companies providing them were at best loosely regulated. M ost did not disclose the ingredients in their products (or were untruthful in doing so) , used misleading language about the ingredients being food safe, and disclaimed their use for inhalation and vaporization , while at the same time , marketing the products to the cannabis industry for use in inhalable products . For cannabis products that are vaporized or inhaled, OLCC's proposed rulemaking will require that all the components of non- cannabis additives be disclosed to OLCC, licensees, and consumers. Manufacturers will also be required to explicitly state their products are meant for human inhalation. They also prohibit the inclusion of particularly problematic ingredients that pose a risk to public health. Lastly, the OLCC's packaging and labeling rul es have been updated to make it clearer to consumers that products contain additives and specifically what those additives are so that they can make an informed decision about what they are consuming. 2 Cannabis Oil: Oregon law divides material extracted from cannabis into two categories : cannabinoid concentrate and cannabinoid extract (collectively, \"Cannabis Oil\") ,1 which are differentiated based on the manner in which cannabinoids are separated from cannabis. Cannabinoid extracts include material where cannabinoids have been separated from cannabis by a process using hydrocarbons as a solvent or by using carbon dioxide in a liquid or supercritical fluid phase as a solvent. Cannabinoid concentrates include material where cannabinoids have been separated from cannabis by a mechanical extraction process such as sifting through a mesh or screen, or by a solvent extraction process that does not use hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide as a solvent. The chemical composition and tetrahydrocannab inol (\"THC\") potency of the initial cannabinoid concentrate or extract can vary dramatically depending on the starting material and the extraction methods and conditions. Cannabinoid concentrates or extracts may undergo further refinement. \"THC distillate\" is a product commonly refined from \"crude\" cannabinoid concentrates or extracts. The crude concentrate or extract is gradually heated to separate compounds based on their boiling points via short -path distillation. If the crude concentrate or extract cont ains cannabis aroma compounds (e.g. terpenes) that distill at a lower temperature than THC, this lower boiling point fraction may be collected prior to increasing the temperature to distill the THC -containing fraction. The THC -containing fraction is typica lly a highly viscous colorless liquid. 1 While imprecise, for the purposes of this paper, the term \"cannabis\" will refer to both marijuana and hemp (as those terms are defined in Oregon law). 3 Inhalable C annabinoid Products: The OLCC 's rulemaking is directed at products that combine marijuana or hemp items that are meant for inhalation (predominantly Cannabis Oil) with processed non-cannabis substances. These products include bulk Cannabis Oil (e.g. as a viscous liquid in jars or in a solid form such as \"shatter\" ), vape cartridges, syringes used to refill vape cartridges, and infused pre - rolls that are combined with processed non- cannabis ingredients (collectively, \"Inhalable generally encompass inhalable or ingestible products that combine a form of cannabis (e.g. extract, concentrate, or flower) with non- cannabis substa nces.2 OLCC's proposed rules would not affect ingestible cannabinoid products because more robust standards and a greater body of literature exist with regard to the safety of ingredients delivered via ingestion. Vape cartridges are the primar y product to which non-cannabis substances are added. The vaping process involves attaching a pre -filled cartridge to a battery, which can operate between 300 degrees and 800 degrees, and inhaling an aerosolized mixture into the lungs.3 The OLCC's seed-to-sale trackin g system tracks broad categories of items (e.g. concentrates, extracts, and cannabinoid products), but does not differentiate between specific subcategories (e.g. vape cartridges versus other forms of concentrate and extract). However, the proposed rules w ould create additional tracking requirements in the seed -to-sale tracking system, including providing manufacturer and ingredient information. This added information will allow OLCC to quickly take action should problematic ingredients be discovered. 2 Or. Admin.

T hey can be found in other plants, animals, and can be synthesized. In addition to other compounds present in cannabis, terpenes can contribute to the flavor and fragrance of cannabis.5 The majority of terpenes found in cannabis are contribute to the \"entourage effect\" in cannabis , which has driven consumer perception and awareness of these compounds.7 The definition of the \"entourage effect\" is somewhat vague, but can be described as a \"synergy - a net benefit resulting from a combination of plant components that is greater than the sum of its parts...\"8 It should be noted that the entourage effect is a theory and at this time is unproven.9 Of relevance, the cannabis plant also contains alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, flavonoids, and lactones which may also contribute to its characteristic aroma.10 4 See, e.g. , Ethan B Russo , \"Taming THC: Potential Cannabis Synergy and Phytocannabinoid- Terpenoid Entourage Effects ,\" British Journal of Pharmacology 7 (December Cannabis Sativa - From Science and Expectations of Cannabis Polypharmacy ,\" Expert Review \"Chemical Cannabis ,\" Essay. and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutic Potential , 28. Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press, 2002, https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203479506. 5 The majority of Cannabis O il in the Oregon marketplace contain s only terpenes derived from cannabis. Terpenes can occur in the cannabis product naturally or be removed through a \"first pass process\" (e.g. steam distillation, short path distillation, or sub- critical CO 2) and reintroduced later. However, some OLCC licensees prefer to add terpenes and other flavoring compounds from non- cannabis sources. This is done due to cost and scalability (e.g. suitability for multi- state operators) . Specific terpenes and ratios differ from bat ch to batch of usable cannabis and can vary \"substantially based on genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.\"11 Processors who wish to create a more cost effective and consistent product rely on purchasing non- cannabis products from third -party companies ( collectively, the \"C ompanies\"). The Companies provide a wide variety of products, ranging from singular non-cannabis terpene isolates to more exotic blends of terpenes and other chemicals (e.g. flavonoids, esters, aldehydes, and ketones) that are meant to mimic the flavor and effects of certain cannabis cultivars (e.g. \" Blue Dream \" or \"OG Kush \"), or non- cannabis specific flavors like watermelon, cotton candy, bubble gum, or grape (collectively, \"Flavor Additives\") . Based on OLCC's licensees prefer to use pre-mixed blends ( as opposed to singular terpene isolates), which may contain non- cannabis terpenes and other chemicals . Some of the blends contain diluents like medium triglyc eride (\"MCT\") oil, propylene glycol (\"PG\"), or ethyl alcohol. It is important to note that the Companies are not regulated by any government or third- party body to provide products meant for human inhalation. Some of them are regulated under 11 Booth, Judith K., Macaire M.s. Yuen, Sharon Jancsik, Physiology , 2020: 3, https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.20.00593. 6 food handling laws and may receive accreditation for food safety or good manufacturing practices (e.g. ISO 9001: 2015 and FSSC 22000) . Neither of these accreditations address the underlying safety of the products when vaporized and inhaled. The Companies also market their products in a manner that suggest they are meant for inhalation and \"[w]hile companies may be marketing pharmaceutical -grade reagents that are approved for other purposes such as ingestion, their safety in [the] vaping scenario is unknown.\"12 Most of the Companies disclaim their use for inhalation, and some go so far as to put the onus on the consumer to conduct their own safety testing on the products.13 The picture of where the Companies source their products from is not entirely clear due to the secretive and unregulated nature of the Companies . Some purchase products from other companies and further refine them , while others purchase them from large chemical suppliers like Sigma Aldrich or \"flavor houses ,\" which ma ke products meant f or ingestion (i.e. culinary use) , and blend them. The cannabis industry colloquially refers to these products as \"botanical terpenes.\" However, the term \"botanical terpene\" does not have a l egal definition in this context , and by and large the Companies do not use this term , which ren ders it essentially meaningless . In fact, to the extent that it is ascertainable, most of the blends used by OLCC licensees contain other ingredients in addition to terpenes. Flavoring Additive s can be derived from natural sources or can be produced synthetically.14 The use of this term obfuscates the reality that many of the products are synthetic or contain a mixture of natural and synthetically derived compounds .

Whether the source of the ingredients makes any difference from a health standpoint is uncl ear.18 Consumers prefer the term \"natural\" on food and cosmetic labeling.19 The terminology \"botanical terpene s\" is generally inaccurate and is likel y used to mislead consumers about the complex mixture of substances they are vaporizing and inhaling. Some OLCC licensees use flavorings that are also present in the e -cigarette marketplace. These primarily consist of products that do not contain terpenes and by and large are not cannabis specific, e.g. cinnamon bun, bubble gum, grape pie, vanilla, or raspberry punch. The OLCC prohibits flavors that are considered attractive to minors such as bubble gum, root beer, and cotton candy.20 These types of products are the minority in the Oregon marketplace . 15 \"Recreational Marijuana Program Compliance Education Bulletin CE2018 -09,\" Oregon Liquor Control Commission (November 28, 2018), https://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Bulletins/Compliance_1809.pdf. 16 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.22(a)(3) 3. 19 See, e.g. , Ferreira, Denise. \"How Are Changes in Consumer Preferences for Natural Products Driving Market Disruption?\" Web log.

In addition to Flavoring Additives, many of the Companies also provide \"thickeners,\" \"cuts ,\" \"diluent blends ,\" or \"odorless and flavorless terpene d iluents.\" Little is known about these products, as the Companies tend to keep their ingredients secret.22 Diluents are used for a variety of reasons, including overcoming hardware limitations of cheaper cartridges and increasing profit margins . Innovations in vape cart technology are beginning to overcome hardware limitations in regards to thicker Cannabis Oils. In Oregon, \"diluent terpenes \" are predominately used and it is common to see phytol and -bisabolol being used as diluent terpenes.23 Both of these terpenes are found in cannabis, however, the health effects of their elevated use is unknown, particularly phytol which naturally appears in low levels in the cannabis plant. MCT oil appears to be used sparingly in the OLCC marketplace. Vaping Induced Lung Injury - Searching for a Cause : During 2019, an outbreak of what the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") dubbed e - cigarette, or vaping, product use -associated lung injury (\"EVALI\" or \"VALI\" ) began. As of February 18, 2020, a total of 2,807 hospitalized VALI cases were reported to the CDC from all 21 The OLCC explicitly prohibits the use of PEG in any cannabis product, see Or. Admin. R. 845 -025-3220(3) (2017). 22 See, e.g., \"Safety Data Sheet - High The Werc Shop, LLC , \"The Werc Shop Announces Latest Innovation in Vaping Technology, \" PR Newswire: news distribution, targeting and monitoring, 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands).24 In Oregon, as of March 12, 2020, 23 cases of VA LI were reported, 2 of which were fatal.25 Persons with VALI experience the f ollowing symptoms: cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, fever, chills, and weight loss.26 The onset of these symptoms ca n be rapid.27 Reported cases of VALI have lessened, as both the Oregon Health Authority (\"OHA\")28 and the CDC have generally stopped accepting reports.29 However, the CDC recently reported nineteen confirmed cases in California.30 The decrease in reported cases i s likely due in part to COVID -19, which necessitated a shift of resources and displays symptoms similar in nature to VALI31 (as part of a VALI diagnosis, COVID -19 must be determinatively ruled out ).32 As of October 2020, no singular substance has been determined to be the causative agent of VALI. However, it does appear that THC containing vaping products and vitamin E acetate (\"VEA\") are strongly linked to the VALI outbreak in some states, particularly the Midwest .33 24 \"Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E -Cigarette, or Vaping, Products,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Accessed July 16, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e - cigarettes/severe- lung-disease.html. 25 \"Oregon Illness Investigation: Acute and Communicable Disease: State of Oregon, Accessed July 16, 2020, https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/COMMUNICABLEDISE ASE/Pages/vaping - illness.aspx. 26 \"For Healthcare Providers,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, March 17, 2020), Accessed July 16, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e - cigarettes/severe- lung-disease/healthcare- providers/index.html. 27 \"For Vaping Illness Investigation. \" 29 \"Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E -Cigarette, or Vaping, Products .\" 30 Christina Armatas, Amy Heinzerling, and Jason A Wilken, \"Notes from the Field: E -Cigarette, or Vaping, Product Use-Associated Lung Injury Cases During the COVID -19 Response - California, 2020,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention, June 25, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6925a5.htm. 31 \"Symptoms of Coronavirus, \" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Accessed October 26, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/symptoms -testing/s Product Use -Associated Lung Injury.\" 33 \"Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E -Cigarette, or Vaping, Products.\" 10 VEA is commonly used as a vitamin supplement and in skincare products.34 However, the CDC states that \"[e]vidence is not sufficient to rule out the contribution of other chemicals of concern....\"35 A study analyzed the bronchoalveolar -lavage fluid (\"BAL\") of 51 VALI patients (none of whom were from Oregon) for \"vitamin E acetate, plant oils, medium- chain triglyceride oil, coconut oil, petroleum distillates, and diluent terpenes.\"36 The study found VEA in the BAL fluids for 94% of the case patients and one patient had coconut oil and limonene in their BAL fluid .37 Acute lung injuries are common among all VALI cases .38 To date, it is unclear whether there is a singular type of lung inj ury associated with VALI, which may be due to the many complex variables involved.

The CDC has reported that most of the VALI cases used THC containing products and were purchased via the illicit market.49 However, Oregon appears to be an outlier - to date there is no evidence any Oregon case purchased products from the illicit market. At the Experts RAC, Dr. Jeanne testified that the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") tested liquids of products from three Oregon cases and found, among other things, cannabinoids, terpenes, and squalene.50 The CDC tested aerosols from seven cannabis vaping products from Oregon cases and found squal ene in all the cannabis product aerosols. Of note, neither the FDA nor CDC found VEA in any Oregon products.51 Prior to these preliminary results, the OLCC was unaware of any licensee using squalene or squalane in Inhalable Cannabinoid P roducts. Squalene is terpene that can be derived from 47 \"2020- 07-24 Additives Rules Advisory Committee - Expert Presentations.mp3,\" Oregon Liquor Control Commission, July 24, 2020: 2:22, https://ecm.olcc.state.or.us/share/s/iOu -w-EVQ0eEZixDcY5FkQ. 48 \"2020- 07-24 - Expert Presentations.mp3,\" 1:49. 49 \"Outbreak of Lung Injury Associated with the Use of E -Cigarette, or Vaping, Products.\" 50 Hamade, Ali and Jeanne, Tom, \"Public Health Aspects of Vaping of Vaping Toxicology,\" 16. 13 plants (e.g. olives , sugar cane, and amaranth) , including in very low amounts in cannabis ,52 or animal sources (i.e. shark livers) .

The presence of squalane in the diluent wa s not disclosed by the manufacturer. VALI Specific Scientific Research - an Overview : Since the 2019 VALI outbreak, several scientific papers have been published that examined the liquids inside a variety of vape cartridges (including illicit and medical products) and what chemicals are produced when they are heated and vaporized. Unfortunately, \"[t]he 52 It should be noted that no firm data exists on how much squalene is present in cannabis flower and extracts, as most cannabis labs are not required to test for this analyte as part of any state mandated testing. However, the data that is available suggests it appears in very low (i.e. trace) amounts. 53 Lee, Jin Seong, Gyungyub Gong, and Tae Hwan Lim , \"Squalene Aspiration Pneumonia: Thin -Section CT and Histopathologic Findings ,\" Journal of the Korean Radiological Society 38, no. 3 (1998): 453, https://doi.o rg/10.3348/jkrs.1998.38.3.453. 54 NOAA Office of Response and Restoration, US GOV. \"Chemical Datasheet ,\" NOAA - Cameo Chemicals , Accessed October 25, 2020, https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/21030. 55 Jiang, Huanhuan, C.

Thus, there is a paucity of risk assessment and toxicological data on THC/cannabis containing products.\"59 Due to the federal illegality of cannabis, researchers have an incredibly difficult job in studying cannabis containing products. From a regulator's perspective, it made the OLCC and OHA's reactive investigation into the causative agent(s) of VALI in Oregon incredibly burdensome as well. Despite the research hurdles that make it difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint all possible causes of lung injury, a general consensus has begun to form. VEA is one contributing cause, but is not unique in its ability to harm. Other additives and similar ingredients show the same physical properties (e.g. high molecular weight and boiling point)60 and pose similar risks to consumers, and many of these ingredients continue to be detected in commercially available Flavor Additives and diluents .61 Duffy et al. analyzed 38 illicit vape cartridges from confirmed VALI patients and six commercially available diluents.62 Notably, the researchers found VEA in 23 of the 36 cartridges and MCT in 15 of the 36 cartridges.63 They al so analyzed commercially available \"diluents\" and \"thickeners\" and found the following substances: VEA, isophytol (an phytol) .64 The authors offer this stark conclusion: \"[t]here is little scientific knowledge of the long -term health effects of vaping any material, and the cannabis -oil vaporizer diluent industry appears to be ope rating with minimal oversight....[T] here 59 Muthumalage et al., \"Chemical Constituents Involved in EVALI ,\" 10 . 60 See e.g., Fiume, Monice, \"Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Squalane and Squalene,\" 39 (Squalane boiling point of 350\u00b0C and squalene at 335\u00b0C) 61 See, e.g. , Duffy et al., \"Analysis of Cannabinoid- Containing Fluids in Cartridges.\" 62 Duffy et \"Analysis of Cannabinoid in Illicit Vaping Cartridges,\" 64 Duffy et al., -Containing Fluids in Illicit Vaping Cartridg e,\" 14. 15 appears to have been no testing for or evaluation of the potential toxic effects of these products in the vaping process. There is no evidence that vaping large amounts of compounds such as VEA, squalane, or othe r chemicals present in diluent products on the market is safe .\"65 Duffy et al.'s findings on the diluents and thickeners are particularly relevant . As previously mentioned, many of the Companies that provide these products do not disclose their ingredients. In September 2019, the New York Department of Health subpoenaed Honey Cut Labs LLC, Floraplex Terpenes, and Mass Terpenes to assist the department in its VALI investigation.66 This is notable because Floraplex and Mass Terpenes continue to supply products to the cannabis industry, including \"Terp Liqu efy\" by Mass Terpenes terpene diluent!\") .68 Neither of these co mpanies makes the ingredients in these products available on their website (Floraplex states that 100% of the chemical makeup is proprietary ).69 Muthumalage et al. examined the liquids found in illicit, CBD, and medical grade cannabis containing cartridges .70 The researchers analyzed both CBD and medical grade cartridges (obtained via New York's medical system) because they were not known to be 65 Duffy et al., \"Analysis of Cannabinoid -Containing Fluids in Illicit Vaping Cartridge,\" 16. 66 \"Governor Cuomo Takes Aggressive Action to Protect New Yorkers from Harmful and Addictive Vaping Products Following Rise in Vaping -Associated Illnesses N ationwide ,\" Governor Andrew M.

However, it is clear that even regulated products can contain harmful substances . More recently, Muthumalage et al. published a study where the health effects of VEA and MCT were evaluated in vitro and in vivo .74 Their results strongly suggest both substances have negative health implications. A recent study by Jiang et al. examined changes in the chemical composition between vaped and unvaped PG, MCT, VEA, and squalane.75 Jiang et al. compared the toxicity of these diluents on cells by exposing cells to the unvaped diluents and vaping emission condensates produced by them. T he \"results revealed significant changes in chemical composition and a shift of cellular toxicity in cells exposed to vaping emission condensates compared to the unvaped liquid diluents, supporting our hypothesis that toxic byproducts formed during the vaping process are important to induce vaping -associated health effects.\"76 The researchers also found \"the chemical composition s of vaping emission products are very different from their parent 71 Muthumalage et al., \"Chemical Constituents Involved in EVALI,\" 2. 72 Muthumalage et al., \"Chemical Constituents Involved in EVALI,\" 4 -7. 73 Muthumalage et al., \"Chemical Constituents Involved in EVALI,\" 9. 74 Muthumalage, Thivanka, Joseph H.

OLCC's proposed rules would also prohibit the inclusion of triglycerides from Inhalable Cannabinoid Products. This includes a wide variety of non -cannabis substances, including, but not limited to vegetable (e.g. MCT) and animal fats. It is well documented that the inhalation of oils causes lipoid pneumonia.82 In the occupational setting, it is also documented that inhalation 77 Huanhuan et al., \"Chemical and Toxicological Characterization of Vaping Emission Products,\" 10. 78 Huanhuan et al., \"Chemical and Toxicological Characterization of Vaping Emission Products,\" 11 -12. 79 Huanhuan et al., \"Chemical and Toxicological Characterization of Vaping Em Products,\" 12.

Assessing the inhalation safety of Flavor Additives and diluents is incredibly complex. Wu and O'Shea state: \" [t]he current worrying trend of increasing vaping- associated lung injuries is due to complex and multifaceted issues encompassing social, physical, and biological, and medical sciences. When viewed from a physical science standpoint, medical complications from vaping a diverse set of substances is perhaps not unexpected as the pyrolytic chemistry of single pure compounds is complex, so what occurs within ill -defined mixtures is a risky venture into the unknown.\"85 The authors conclude: \" [c]onsidering the continuing evolving and large number of natural and synthetic substances used in recreational vaping and the unknown chemistries that may occur under vaping pyrolysis conditions, urgent research into this topic is now required.\"86 While regulators wait for a greater understanding of the health risks consumers may expose themselves to by consuming these products, some sectors of the can nabis industry continue to use F lavoring Additives and advocate for their use with at best unclear evidence of their safety. 83 See, e.g. , Svedahl, \"Short Term Exposure to Cooking Fumes and Pulmonary Function, \" Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology 4, no. 1 (2009): 9, https://doi.org/10.1186/1745- 6673- 4-9. 84 See, e.g. , Chen, Huang -Chi, Chia -Fang Wu, Inn -Wen Chong, and Ming -Tsang Wu. \"Exposure to Cooking Oil Fumes and Chronic Bronchitis in Nonsmoking Women Aged 40 Years and over: a Health -Care Based Study ,\" BMC Public Health 18, no. 1 (2018) , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889- 018-5146- x. 85 Wu and O'Shea, \"Potential for Release of Pulmonary Toxic Ketene,\" 6354. 86 Wu and O'Shea, \"Potential for Release of Pulmonary Toxic Ketene,\" 6354. 19 Looking to E -cigarette Regulation: E-cigarettes were introduced to the market in 2003 and have only increased in popularity.87 These products include: vapes, vaporizers, vape pens, hookah pens, and electronic cigarettes (collectively, known as elect ronic nicotine delivery systems or \"ENDS\").88 ENDS produce \"aerosolized nicotine in vapor form (e -vapor) by heating e -cigarette liquid (or e -liquid), which is typically composed of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and flavoring compounds.\"89 Generally speaking, ENDS safety is unknown: \"[the] long -term health effects are unknown and emerging preclinical and clinical studies suggest that e -cigarettes may not be harmless.\"90 In the United States, the FDA regulates ENDS devices and prema rket approval must be given by the FDA starting September 9, 2020 to legally sell ENDS products.91 ENDS producers must submit to the FDA a premarket tobacco product application (\"PMTA\"), including scientific data that demonstrates the \"product is appropriat e for the protection of the public health.\"92 To date, only one ENDS product has received premarket approval by the FDA - IQOS by Phillip 87 Andrey Khlystov and Vera Samburova , \"Flavoring Compounds Dominate Toxic Aldehyde Production during E - Cigarette Vaping ,\" Environmental Science & Technology 50, no. 23 (2016): 13080, https://d oi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b05145. 88 Products, Center for Tobacco , \"Vaporizers, E -Cigarettes, and Other ENDS ,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration , Accessed July 17, Exhaled Breath during E -Cigarette Vaping: Pilot Study Results ,\" Toxics 6, no. 3 https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics6030046.

To the OLCC's knowledge, none of the Companies or OLCC licensees have conducted any kind of safety study of Flavor Additives or diluents . It should also be noted that the FDA is regulating flavors that appeal to minors.95 Flavorings & Diluent R esearch in Nicotine Containing ENDS Products: By and large, Flavoring Additives and diluents have not been tested for inhalation safety or chronic use. Chronic use should be considered when evaluating these products, as many ENDS users and consumers of Inh alable Cannabinoid Products use them frequently. John Hallagan , general counsel and senior advisor to the Flavor & Extract Manufacturers Association (\"FEMA\"), states: [T]here is little data available on the effects of inhalation exposure of flavoring substances in laboratory animal models. There are two reasons for this. First, for physiological reasons, the rat is an inadequate species for inhalation exposure studies. Second, there is no requirement for the generation of inhalation exposure data as a condition of approval for the use of food ingredients including flavoring substances - the focus of the regulatory programs for food ingredients is ingestion exposure.96 93 \"Premarket Tobacco Product Marketing Orders ,\" U.S .

Prior to the invention of the first e -cigarette, humans were not purposefully heating and inhaling flavoring compounds deeply into their lungs multiple times a day. However, the research that has been conducted on flavorings and diluents in ENDS devices makes it clear that some of these products do cause harm and are not innocuous substances. Most nicotine -containing ENDS devices use PG or VG as a carrier for the nicotine and flavorings. It is known that both VG and PG produce aldehydes during vaping conditions.98 Common examples of aldehydes are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde, which are all on the FDA's \"Harmful and Potentiall y Harmful Constituents in Tobacco Products and Tobacco Smoke: Established List .\"99 Formaldehyde is a human carcinogen and acetaldehyde is possibly carcinogenic to humans.100 Inhalation of aldehydes can have negative health consequences.101 Some use PEG, which produce s formaldehyde and acetaldehyde under vaping conditions.102 97 Hallagan and Hall, \"FEMA GRAS - A GRAS Assessment Program for Flavor Ingredients,\" 423. 98 See e.g. , Gillman, Stewart, and A.r.

It has been documented that \"numerous mostly to the respiratory system.\"107 Cytotoxicity is toxicity caused by chemical agents on living cells.108 It has been shown that the thermal decomposition of flavoring compounds are \"the main source of aldehydes in vapors produced by e -liquids....\"109 A study by Samburova et al. tested the exhaled vapor from nicotine ENDS devices containing PG/VG and flavorings (e.g. bubblegum, watermelon, fruit mix, and menthol) and found elevated levels of formaldeh yde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein110 - all of which are toxic.111 103 See, e.g. , Mckinley, Jesse, \"Flavoring -Factory Illnesses Raise Inquiries ,\" The New York Times, May 6, 2007, https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/us/06butter.html. 104 \"Flavorings -Related Lung Disease - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic, \" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, October 3, 2017, https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings/default.h tml. 105 Hallagan, of e -Cigarettes.\" Food and Chemical Toxicology 138 (2020): 7, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.111245. 108 \"Cytotoxicity - an Overview ,\" ScienceDirect , Accessed July 17, 2020, https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/cytotoxicity. 109 Compounds Samburova et al., \"Aldehydes in Exhaled 10. 111 See e.g. , Traboulsi et al., \"Inhalation Toxicology of Vaping Products and Implications for Pulmonary Health,\" 8. 23 It may be argued that in the context of cannabis, these results are irrelevant. However, many of the Companies use these ingredients in their products. As previously mentioned, it is incredibly difficult to gain a clear picture of what ingredients are in most of the Flavoring Additives because there are currently no disclosure requirements; however, some of the Companies do list non- terpene ingredients in their SDS. For example, \"Blue Berry\" from Extract Consultants lists cinnamaldehyde, ingredients112 Terpenes lists benzaldehyde as an ingredient114 and \"Black Lime Infused \" lists pulegone as an ingredient.115 When administered orally, pulegone is a known carcinogen and likely has similar effects when inhaled.116 Greater transparency by the Companies would likely result in the discovery of many more potentially harmful flavoring ing redients. Flavorings and Food Safety - Looking to the FDA and \"GRAS\" status : It is relevant to look at federal food safety laws in the context of eva luating Flavor Additive safety. Due to a lack of regulation in the inhalati on sphere, many of the Companies mislead consumers into thinking their products are safe for inhalation by stating they are \"food safe,\" \"food grade,\" or \"GRAS.\" Many of the Flavor Additives can be classified as \"food additives\" under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"F FDCA\").117 In 1958, due to 112 \"Blueberry Terpene Blend - Safety Data Sheet,\" Extract Consultants, LLC , Accessed July 17, 2020, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0148/2348/9584/files/TPBS04.SDS.BlueberryTerpeneBlend.pdf?v=252984487345 122668. 113 \"Mentholated Oil Terpene Blend - Safety Data Sheet,\" Extract Consultants, LLC , Accessed July 17, 2020, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0148/2348/9584/files/TPBL19.SDS.MentholatedOilSFTF.pdf?v=50801515348982 57244. 114 \"Safety Data Sheet - Forbidden Fruit .\" 115 \"Safety Data Sheet - Black Lime Infused, True Terpenes , Accessed July 17, 2020, https://trueterpenes.com/certificates/sds/Black_Lime_ID_SDS_True_Terpenes.pdf . 116 \"Risk Analysis for the Carcinogen Pulegone in Mint - and Menthol -Flavored e- Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products ,\" JAMA Internal Medicine 179, no. 12 (2019): 1721, https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.3649. 117 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348 (2018). 24 concerns about flavoring substances being added to food, Congress enacted the Food Additives Amendment (\"F AA\") to the FFDCA .118 The F AA \"placed squarely on the industry the burden of demonstrating safety and established a new require ment for premarket approval of food additives as defined in the F AA.\"119 The F AA mandates premarket approval of all \"food additives\" unless the ingredient is generally recognized as safe (\"GRAS\").120 The FFDCA recognizes that naturally occurring substances in food shoul d be held to a lesser standard and it places a much higher threshold of scrutiny on added substances ( e.g. flavorings) and may consider food \"adulterated\" if it is \"injurious to health.\"121 This is because humans have a history of self - regulating when it comes to harmful substances naturally present in food.122 The statutory requirements of the FFDCA for GRAS conclusions made through scientific procedures require \"[a] general recognition of safety by qualified experts, [t]he experts must be qualifie d by scientific training and experience to evaluate the substance's safety, [t]he experts must base their conclusion of safety on scientific procedures, [and] [t]he conclusion of general recognition of safety must take account of the substance's conditions of intended use.\"123 Additionally \"GRAS status also depends on whether there is common understanding of a substance's safety.

Therefore, FEMA GRAS status for the use o f flavor ingredients in food does not provide regulatory authority to use flavor ingredients in vaping products.\"129 \"FEMA does not support the use of flavors in vaping products in the absence of rigorous safety assessments performed by vaping product manufacturers and 124 Hallagan and Hall, \"FEMA GRAS - A GRAS Assessment Program for Flavor Ingredients,\" 425. 125 Hallagan et al. , \"The GRAS Provision,\" 4. 126 Hallagan, Hall, and Drake, \"The GRAS Provision - The FEMA GRAS Program and the Safety and Regulation of Flavors in the United States,\" 2. 127 Hallagan, Hall, and Drake, \"The GRAS Provision - The FEMA GRAS Program and t he Safety and Regulation of Flavors in the United States,\" 2. 128 Hallagan, Hall, and Drake, \"The GRAS Provision - The FEMA GRAS Program and the Safety and Regulation of Flavors in the United States,\" 2. 129 Hallagan, John, \"Safety and Regulatory Authority to Use Flavors - Focus on Vaping Products ,\" FEMA, March 2020, https://www.femaflavor.org/safety -regulatory -authority- use-flavors -focus -vaping -products. 26 marketers that demonstrate safety for this use. The manufacturers and marketers of vaping products...and flavor manufacturers and marketers, should not represent or suggest that th e flavor ingredients used in these products are safe because they have FEMA GRAS status for use in food because such statements are false and misleading.\"130 It is important to note that Congress was concerned with flavoring additives people were ingesting w hen they enacted the FFDCA and subsequent FFA. Ingestion and inhalation are vastly different methods of consumption. The digestive system is designed to assist the body in processing toxic substances ; the lungs, however, are not and are much more sensitive to toxicants. Because of this, greater care and consideration should be given to substances being heated and inhaled. Neither Congress nor the FDA has shown any appetite for similar GRAS status for inhalable products. However, as discussed previously, the FDA has begun the process of regulating e -cigarettes. It should also be emphasized that neither the Companies nor e - cigarette manufacturers have created an organization like FEMA to address the safety of the products they sell. As a recognized private partner with the FDA that administers GRAS certification , FEMA's stance on using flavors in vaping products is particularly relevant because many of the Companies suggest their products are \"GRAS\" or \"food safe.\" This is done because many of the Companies provide vague disclaimers that their products are intended for culinary use. However, they clearly market to the cannabis industry (e.g. creating cannabis cultivar specific strain profiles and appearing at cannabi s trade shows ) and know that their products will be used in 130 Hallagan, \"Safety and Regulatory Authority to Use Flavors - Focus on Vaping Products.\" 27 vaporization applications . Most of the Companies have sections on their websites dedicated for how to mix or use the ir products. For example, one of the C ompanies' \"Mixing Calculator\" asks \"How many grams of extract do you want to mix?\"131 Another' s \"Add Back Statement\" states their products are \"designed to work directly with CO2 oil or Distillate\" and are meant \"primarily [for] Vape Pens and Tinctures .\"132 Examples of food safety language by the Companies include: \"Recommended Use: Concentrated aromatic and flavor ingredients which may be used in flavor and fragrance compounds according to legal and IFRA or FEMA GRAS/FDA guidelines .\"133 \"Are terpenes safe for human consumption ?

Safety Data Sheets, Trade Secrets , and Unlisted Ingredients : Federal law requires chemical manufacturers and distributors to provide safety data sheets (\"SDS\") for products with at least some toxic ingredients to downstream users to inform them of what is in the product, what hazards the ingredients may pose, and what precautions should be taken when handling them in industrial use scenarios .139 The Companies are subject to these requirements. Through the OLCC's observations, there are a wide variety of SDS provided by the Companies - ranging from full y compliant with federal requirements to completely deficient with those requirements . An SDS should provide a full list of chemicals present in the product that are known to be acutely toxic .140 If some ingredients are of unknown acute toxicity, the SDS must state so.141 If the product is a mixture, the SDS must list the exact percentages or ranges of each chemical.142 137 \"Safety Data Sheet - Gelato,\" Abstrax Tech , Accessed July 17, 2020, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2149/6413/files/GELATO_SDS_2019_FINAL.pdf?3245. 138 Data Sheet for Terpene Blend,\" Mass Terpenes LLC , 1910.1200(g), Appendix D, Table D.1., 3 ( 2019). 29 However, if a trade secret is claimed, the manufacturer may withhold the exact composition and percentage by utilizing a disclaimer.143 Typically, an SDS will list the common name of the chemical and the CAS Registry Number. The CAS number specifically identifies what substance is being referenced. This is important because some common names of substances can refer to multiple variations of that sub stance (i.e. isomers) . In some cases, the vari ants can have different effects (e.g. Thalidomide ).144 SDS reviewed by the OLCC differ widely in how much detail is disclosed - sometimes disclosing no ingredients, a partial list of ingredients, the majority of ingredients with a caveat that it may contain other substances, or missing CAS numbers. It is common to see either some or all of the ingredients withheld as a trade secret. Examples of ingredient lists in SDS include: \"Agent Orange\" by D enver by Abstrax Tech states: \"Specific chemical identities and/or exact percentages of composition are being withheld as a trade secret...\"146 \"Gorilla Glue 4\" by Connoisseur Concentrates lists some ingredients but then states: \"This product may contain other natural and artificial 143 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1200(g), Appendix D, , \"Thalidomide -Induced Teratogenesis: History and Mechanisms ,\" Birth Defects Research Part C: Embryo Today: Reviews 105, no. 2 (2015): 140- 56, 145 \"Material Safety Data Sheet - Abstrax Tech , Accessed July 17, 2020, 2, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2149/6413/files/Abstrax_Tech_King_Louie_XIII_SDS.pdf?25164. 30 ingredients.

This is relevant in this context because many of the Companies protect some or all of the ingredients and their concentrations as trade secrets (whether in their SDS or \"ingredient decks\") . It is possible that some OLCC licensed processors sign non- disclosure agreements (\"NDA\") with the Companies to obtain full or partial disclosure. However, the dis closure likely does not apply to downstream licensees (e.g. wholesalers and retailers), who are in the dark as to the composition of the products they are selling. Of course, this exposes licensees to a great deal of liability or risk if the products cause harm. It is unclear how widespread the practice of disclosure via NDA is - the OLCC does have many examples of licensees who are unaware of the full ingredient composition of the Flavor Additives they are using. Preliminary research also shows that comme rcially available Flavoring Additives provided by the Companies contain undisclosed and unidentified ingredients. ChemHistory, an 147 \"Material Data Safety Sheet,\" Connoisseur Concentrates , July 4, https://www.mrextractor.com/wp ccessed July 17, 2020, 5, 149 \"Safety Data Sheet - Banana Kush,\" -Kush -4.pdf. 31 OLCC licensed lab, tested several commercially available Flavor Additives. In samples of myrcene and geraniol - products that were marketed as pure isolates of those terpenes - other terpenes were present as were unknown compounds.150 Dr. Robert Strongin also tested similar products and identified PEG; naphthalene , a substance used in mothballs ; and methyl anthranilate , a grape flavoring.151 Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, Dr. Strongin's research was put on hold, but he expects to eventually publish the results. What these results make clear, is that these ingredients may not be what they are purported to be and the y may con tain substances that are known to be toxic. To state the obvious, it makes a regulator's job incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to begin to try and assess the safety of the Flavor Additives and diluents when the ingredients are hidden and contradictory statements are included about product composition. Withholding the concentrations is also problematic as well, as it may be found that certain substances in certain concentration ranges or ratios may cause harm. It should be strongly noted that regulators, licensees, and consumers should not rely on the SDS as the sole source of ingredients. Disclaimers - Passing Liability to Licensees and Consumers : As previously mentioned, m ost of the Companies do not explicitly state their products are meant for inhalation, and are rather intended for ingestion. Each Company provides on their website or SDS some kind of disclaimer. M ost are fairly explicit about disavowing their usage or safety for inhalation.

This situa tion is somewhat analogous to \"off -label drug use.\" When FDA approves new medications, they are approved for specific indications (or \"on- label\" prescribing).157 Only a trained medical professional can prescribe drugs for off- label use and is done under the prescriber's supervision.158 It is unrealistic for the OLCC to accept that its licensees are using products for which the manufacturers do not advise their use in the vaping scenario. If the Companies will not stand behind the use of their products for inhalation, then consumers should not be subjected to products that aren't being used in their intended manner. Consumer Right to Know - Ingredient Listings and Allergens For food products that contain compounds that are solely meant to impart flavor, manufacturers can list the broad category of compounds simply as \"natural\" or \"artif icial\" flavors on the label. Previously, the OLCC issued guidance allowing its licensees to include Flavoring Additives on the label s' ingredient lists using these terms. However, these terms do not 156 \"Safety Data Sheet - Golden Ticket Terpene Profile,\" Atlas Technology Manufacturing, LLC , Accessed on M., Christopher M. Burkle, and William L. Lanier, \"Ten Common Questions (and Their Answers) About Off -Label D rug Use,\" Mayo Clinic Proceedings 87, no. 10 (2012): 982 -90, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.04.017. 158 Wittich et al., \"Ten Common Questions (and Their Answers) About Off -Label Drug Use.\" 34 provide consumers with any meaningful information about t he substances they are consuming. This is exacerbated by the secretive nature of ingredient disclosure by the Companies. As previously mentioned, food additives or flavorings that are being introduced into food must be GRAS, otherwise they are considered adulterants. The GRAS process rigorously assesses the safety of the flavor additives under their intended use. No such evaluation process exists for Flavor Additives that are vaporized and inhaled. Therefore, the OLCC's proposed rules will require all ingr edients to be displayed on the label so that consumers may make informed decisions. Research also shows that food additives can cause allergic reactions both internally159 and externally (i.e. contact allergen s).160 Watanabe et al. found that in guinea pig models, various aldehydes, including citral, ethyl vanillin, vanillin, and benzaldehyde (present in some Flavoring Additives) induced allergic skin reactions.161 Some researchers have already called into question the potential for allergic reactions when inhaling flavors in e- cigarettes and e- liquids and stressed toxicological principals guide their selection and inclusion levels.162 In at least one example, a case report suggests an e- cigarette user suffered hypersensit ivity pneumonitis due to their use of e-cigarettes.163 Because of the possibility of Flavor Additives containing potential allergens, it is even more important to fully disclose the ingredients on a label. 159 See, e.g., Ramirez, Daniel A, and Sami L Bahna, \"Food Hypersensitivity by Inhalation ,\" Clinical and Molecular Allergy 7, no. 1 (2009) , https://doi.org/10.1186/1476- 7961- 7-4.

Weiner, Andrew Nowalk, and Allyson Larkin, \"Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome From E -Cigarette Use ,\" Pediatrics 141, no. 6 (2018), https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016- 3927. 35 Conclusion : Because humans do not have a long history of heating, vaporizing, and inhaling a wide variety of chemicals deeply into the ir lungs, there is a lack of scientific consensus on what compounds are problematic and what precautionary principals should apply . However, science is beginning to cat ch up on the creativity of both the e -cigarette and cannabis industries. Furthermore, the FDA is now taking an active role in assessing the safety of Flavoring Additives. It is likely in the coming years, much more will be known about the short -term health effects of vaping various chemical compounds. Unfortunately, the long -term health implications of these products may take many more years to fully understand, similar to tobacco. OLCC's proposed rulemaking is the first attempt at establishing minimum standards for non-cannabis ingredients used in Inhalable Cannabinoid Products within the Oregon cannabis market. These standards would prohibit the ingredients most suspected of causing acute harm, and provide greater clarity both on the contents and intended use of other ingredients. Requiring that the Companies fully disclose their ingredients to OLCC, licensees, and consumers will allow OLCC to more easily evaluate Flavor Additives for adulterants and take quicker action should problematic ingredients arise , and also provide consumers with a more informed choice about the products they are vaporizing and inhaling into their lungs.
