COVID-19 is spread from person to person through the air. COVID-19 can affect your lungs or other organs. Symptoms may be mild or serious and include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, tiredness, body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, runny or stuffy nose, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The COVID-19 vaccine is used to help prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully approved the Moderna vaccine for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in people 18 years of age and older. COVID-19 vaccine does not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19. This vaccine will not treat an active COVID-19 infection. Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine may not provide protection in every person. warnings What is the most important information I should know about Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (Intramuscular)?

Ask your doctor if you are unsure about any COVID-19 treatments you received. Tell your vaccination provider if: - you have a fever; - you have any allergies; - you have had inflammation in or around your heart (myocarditis or pericarditis); - you have bleeding problems, or if you use a blood thinner (warfarin, Coumadin, Jantoven); - you have a weak immune system caused by disease or by using certain medicine; - you are pregnant or breastfeeding; - you've received any other COVID-19 vaccine; or - you have fainted after receiving an injection.
