The BSP II will provide additional generating capaci ty and baseload energy for the benefit of the utilities' customers. In July 2005, the utilities filed an application with the PUC for an Energy Conversion Facility Siting Permit for the BSP II. That application is available online at: www.state.sd.us/puc/commission/dockets/ele ctric/2005/EL05-022/application.pdf Studies conducted by Otter Tail Power Company for the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) have shown that the ex isting transmission system is not capable of handling the output from BSP II. The existing tr ansmission lines would seriously overload if an additional 600 MW of power were added to the pres ent system. Therefore, additional transmission facilities are required to provide additional outlet capa city for the electricity th at will be generated by the new unit. The utilities are submitting this Application for a Transmission Facility Siting Permit for the South Dakota portion of two new high voltage transmissi on lines from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to termination points at substations in Minnesota. On e new transmission line would run from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation in South Dakota to th e Morris Substation near Morris, Minnesota, a total of approximately 48 miles, only four miles of wh ich are in South Dakota. The other transmission line would run from the Big Stone 230 kV Substati on to Granite Falls Substation near Granite Falls, Minnesota, a distance of approximately 90 miles, 33 miles of which would be in the state of South Dakota. The Big Stone to Morris transmission line would be constructed at 230 kV. The Granite Falls transmission line would be constructed at 345 kV but operated initially at 230 kV. These transmission lines will actually serve two pur poses: (1) provide an outlet for the power from the proposed BSP II and (2) increase the transmissi on capacity and improve reliability of the electric transmission system in the Buffalo Ridge area in South Dakota and Minnesota. The Granite Falls transmission line is proposed to be constructed at 345 kilovolts (kV) to provide this additional capacity to transport other energy from the Buffa lo Ridge area in South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota to the Twin Cities and other ma rkets when such power becomes available. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 2 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Because the Granite Falls 230 kV Substation and the Morris 230 kV Substation are owned by the Western Area Power Administration (Western) and the Applicants have requested interconnection at those facilities, a federal environmental impact statement (EIS) is required. The EIS is being prepared by Western and will evaluate the corrido rs in which the routes are being considered. The Big Stone Transmission Project map is shown in Figure 1. In October 2005, the utilities filed an applicati on with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a Certificate of Need (CON) for th e Minnesota portion of these two new transmission lines. That application is available online at: http://www.bigstoneii.com The utilities evaluated several transmission sys tem alternatives before deciding on the Morris transmission line and the Granite Falls transmissi on line. As explained in the Minnesota CON application, these two lines were determined to be the best alternatives from an environmental, electrical and cost standpoint. One system alternative that has been examined in detail as part of the Minnesota application is a 230 kV transmission lin e from Big Stone to the Willmar, Minnesota area, which would replace the conversion of Big Stone to Morris transmission line. The utilities are submitting this application to the PUC of the State of South Dakota for the South Dakota portion of the two transmission lines. Th e South Dakota routes are more specifically described as follows. The Morris Transmission Line: Approximately four miles of the new transmission line from Big Stone to Mo rris will be in South Dakota. The preferred route for this transmission line is south (approximately 1.25 miles) from the existing 230 kV Big Stone Substation (Big Stone 23 0 kV Substation) to the site for a new 345 kV Big Stone Substation (Big Stone 345 kV Substation), th en southeast approximately one mile to U.S. Highway 12, then east into Minnesota along th e existing ROW of a 115 kV transmission line. The Granite Falls Transmission Line: The route for the Big Stone to Granite Falls tran smission line has a 230 kV segment that parallels the 230 kV Morris transmission line 1.25 miles from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to the Big Stone 345 kV Substation. The transmission line built for 345 kV will travel from the Big Stone 345 kV Substation approximately 33 miles to near the ci ty of Gary, South Dakota before turning east to the Minnesota border and on to the substation at Canby, Minnesota and then to the Granite Falls BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 3 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Substation, a total of approximately 90 miles. The route in South Dakota is described in the following segments. SEGMENT A (5.3 MILES ): This segment of transmission line will consist of new single circuit 345 kV transmission line constructed from the Big Stone 345 kV Substation east and then south towards U.S. Highway 12, to 150th Street near Section 18 of Alban Township 120N, Range 47W in Grant County, South Dakota. SEGMENT B (22.6 MILES ): This segment will consist of a new single circui t 345 kV transmission line constructed south of Segment A traveling south to Section 6 of Glenwood Township, 116N, Range 47W in Deuel County. SEGMENT C (4.8 MILES ): This segment will consist of a new single circui t 345 kV transmission line constructed south of Segment B. The segment will travel southeast to the southwest corner of 176th Street and County Road 310 or 488th Avenue to the South Dakota endpoint in Section 27 of Township 116N, Range 47W, north of Gary, South Dakota. This segment will travel in a valley to the east of the Blair Substation crossing under the exis ting Western Area Power Administration 230 kV transmission line and will then cross over the Big Stone to Blair 23 0 kV transmission line to the South Dakota border crossing. A map showing the preferred route segments is shown in Figure 2 and Appendix A.1 through A.5. In addition to the two new transmission lines, the utilities must also upgrade the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and construct a new substation to handle the 345 kV transmission. The Big Stone 230 kV Substation, located south of the Plant, will require upgrading to handle the additional 230 kV transmission lines and the 230 kV connection to the n ew generator. The utilities will require a slight expansion of the present substation area by approx imately 50 feet by 375 feet or 0.43 acres located on plant property. The Big Stone 345 kV Substa tion will be constructed approximately 1.25 miles southeast of the Plant. Approximately 600 x 600 f eet or 8.3 acres of area will be required for the new substation. Finally, a small portion of the existing Hankinson 230 kV transmission line will have to be relocated on BSP property to accommodate the BSP II construction. The utilities estimate that the facilities to be constructed in South Dakota will cost between $29 and $41 million. The entire transmission project is es timated to cost between $93 and $135 million. The transmission lines are scheduled to be in service by 2010 in order to satisfy the increasing demand for electricity by the utilities' customers. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 4 J ANUARY 12, 2006 In selecting the preferred routes for the new transmission line, the utilities examined several different possibilities. One system alternative that has been considered is the construction of a new 230 kV transmission line to the Willmar, Minneso ta area. The MPUC will ultimately determine which system alternative to select, the Applicants' preferred line to Morris or the Willmar line. The Minnesota route selection will not affect the South Dakota portion of the 230 kV transmission line. There is no system alternative to the Granite Falls transmission line, but there are several different route options under consideration in Minnesota. Minnesota law requires a utility proposing a new 345 kV transmission line to recommend a preferred route and suggest an alternative route. While the Minnesota preferred and alternative route will match up with the proposed South Dakota route at the border, additional routes are under consideration that would change the South Dakota route. One alternative route being considered in the Mi nnesota route application would be located on the Minnesota side of the border rather than in South Dakota, thus eliminating nearly 30 miles of transmission line in South Dakota. If this alternati ve route is selected, the border crossing would be located at 150th Street along the southern edge of Section 10 of Alban Township 120N, Range 47W in Grant County. This alternative route is shown in Appendix A.6. Several other corridors were considered by the utilities in preparation of the Minnesota CON Application, and the Western Area Power Administra tion also considered othe r possible corridors as part of the EIS it is preparing. The utilities be lieve that the other possible routes within these corridors offer no environmental or electrical bene fits over the preferred routes and should be rejected. An application for a Route Permit for the two transmission lines will be submitted to the MPUC on December 9, 2005 and it will be necessary for the two agencies to coordinate approval of a border crossing. In this Application the utilities have addressed a ll those matters set forth in SDCL Chapter 49-41B and in ARSD chapter 20:10:22 (entitled Energy Fac ility Siting Rules) Included with this Application is a Completion Checklist (Table 1) that sets forth where in the Application each requirement of the rules is addressed.

The Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), an a ssociation of electric ut ilities and other electric industry participants organized in 1972 for th e purpose of pooling generation and transmission facilities, predicts that the region's electricity de mand will grow by more than 15 percent over the next decade and that present excess capacity within the service areas will be depleted in five years. No new baseload facilities have been built in the region since the 1980s. The Applicants determined that the best way to begin to meet this increasing demand is to build a new 600 MW baseload unit at the Big Stone Plant. Also, no major transmission fac ilities have been constructed since the 1980s and the existing transmission system is nearly at its capacity. The new transmission lines the Applicants seek thro ugh this application are needed for two primary reasons: To provide interconnection service to accommodate the proposed 600 MW BSP II facility; and To increase capacity and improve reliabili ty of the electric transmission system in western/southwestern Minnesota and easter n South Dakota and to support future independent transmission projects in the region, in particular a 345 kV transmission line planned to connect the Buffalo Ridge area with the Twin Cities metro area. In sum, these new transmission lines will provide th e best available outlet capability to accommodate additional baseload power from the proposed BS P II and facilitate expansion of the regional transmission grid in order to relieve congesti on, provide transmission capacity and maintain transmission system reliability.

Annual operation and maintenance cost s are estimated to be ap proximately $30,000 per year for the transmission lines and $10,000 to $15,000 per year for the substations and are dependent on setting, amount of vegetation ma nagement necessary, storm damage occurrences, structure types, age of the transmission line, etc. It is anticipated that very little maintenance will be required for the first several years since the tran smission line will be new. These costs do not include any costs related to restoration or mitigation. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 13 J ANUARY 12, 2006 6.0 DEMAND FOR TRANSMISSION FACILITY (ARSD 10:22:10) The Applicants serve retail and wholesale custom ers, including rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities where peak load demands rang e from a low of approximately 90 MW for the smallest utility to 2,500 MW for the largest utility. Ge neration deficits are predicted to occur by the year 2011. The MAPP region's energy requirements ar e expected to grow by more than 15 percent over the next nine years and current excess capacity is expected to be gone within the next five years. The facility will provide outlet capacity for the proposed 600 MW BSP II baseload generation project and will maintain the reliability of transmission in the region. Otter Tail completed a BSP II Generator Interconnection Study for the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) in November 2004 (Interconnection Study). The purpose of the study was to identify the impacts th e proposed BSP II would have on the existing transmission system including prior interconnecti on requests in the MISO and Western queues. The Interconnection Study found that without additional transmission infrastructure, a second unit at Big Stone would overload the current system, resultin g in severe violations of the regional reliability criteria. The MISO interconnection study identified two al ternatives that would provide the transmission capacity required for the BSP II project and future regional power demands. Both alternatives include the construction of a tr ansmission line between Big Stone and Granite Falls, Minnesota. The preferred alternative includes a 230 kV transmi ssion line between Big Stone and the City of Morris in addition to the Granite Falls transmission line. The other alternative includes the construction of a 230 kV transmission line between Big Stone and Willmar, Minnesota in addition to the Granite Falls transmission line. The decision to construct the Granite Falls tran smission line at 345 kV was in response to regional planning efforts. There are several regional planni ng studies, such as the Capital Expenditures by the Year 2020 (CapX 2020), Northwest Explorator y Study, Buffalo Ridge Incremental Generation Outlet Study (BRIGO) and Southwest Minnesota \u00c6 Twin Cities Electric High Voltage (SW MN \u00c6 TC EHV) being conducted by regional utilities an d MISO. Given the preliminary results of these studies, the addition of a 345 kV transmission lin e in the region helps meet the growing need for transmission capacity in Minnesota, South Dakota and neighboring states. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 14 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Together these regional studies confirm that constructing the Big Stone to Granite Falls transmission line at 345 kV is the most feasible and prudent manner in which to accomplish the objective to expand transmission capability in the region. Additionally, sizing the transmission line at 345 kV fits into the regional transmission pl an to support independent transmission projects, in particular a 345 kV transmission line planned to connect the Buffalo Ridge area with the Twin Cities. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 15 J ANUARY 12, 2006 7.0 GENERAL SITE DESCRIPTION (ARSD 10:22:11) The transmission lines for which this Application is submitted include the Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line from the Big Stone 345 kV Substa tion to the Granite Falls Substation near Granite Falls, Minnesota; the 230 kV transmission line whic h connects the 345 kV transmission line to the Big Stone 230 kV Substation; and the Morris 230 kV transmission line from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to the Morris Substation near Morris, Mi nnesota. The two 230 kV transmission lines will be located in Grant County and the 345 kV transmission line will be located in Grant and Deuel counties. The routes are shown on an aerial ph oto backdrop in Appendix A.1 through A.5. The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line is a 33 -mile South Dakota portion of a 90-mile 345 kV transmission project. The 230 kV transmission line connector will span approximately 1.25 miles; and the Morris 230 kV transmission line is a 4-m ile portion of a 48 mile 230 kV transmission project. The northern portion of the facility is located in Grant County and the southern portion in Deuel County. The location by Township, Range and Section is listed in Table 4.

The ROW for the 230 kV transmission lines will be 125 feet wide for any sections of the transmission line that do not follow existing corridors, and approximately 82.5 feet wide for the portions that parallel roadway ROW. The Applicants' preferred structure at this time is single circuit, H-frame with an average height of approximately 100 feet for most of the route. However, the final structure type and material will be determined based on an engineering analysis. On average, the transmi ssion line will span 700-800 feet between structures, depending on the structure type selected. 7.1 GRANITE FALLS 345 KV TRANSMISSION LINE The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line can be broken into three segments (shown as Segments A-C in Figure 2). The facility will require new c onstruction for the entire 33 miles of the South Dakota route and will include the construction of the Big Stone 345 kV Substation when other regional facilities are constructed and the tran smission system can support this transmission line being energized at 345 kV. The three facility segments are described from north to south as follows: Segment A (5.3 miles): This segment of transmission line will consist of new single circuit 345 kV transmission line constructed from the Big Stone 345 kV Substation south towards U.S. Highway 12, to 150th Street near Section 18 of Alban Township 120N, Ra nge 47W in Grant County, South Dakota. Segment B (22.6 miles): This segment will consist of a new single circui t 345 kV transmission line constructed south of Segment A traveling south to Section 6 of Glenwood Township, 116N, Range 47W in Deuel County. Segment C (4.8 miles): This segment will consist of a new single circui t 345 kV transmission line constructed south of Segment B. The segment will travel southeast to the southwest corner of 176th Street and County Road 310 or 488th Avenue to the South Dakota endpoint in Section 27 of Township 116N, Range 47W, north of Gary, South Dakota. This segment will travel in a valley to the east of the Blair Substation crossing under the exis ting Western Area Power Admini stration 230 kV transmission line BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 17 J ANUARY 12, 2006 and will then cross over the Big Stone to Blair 23 0 kV transmission line to the South Dakota border crossing. A map showing the preferred route segments is shown in Figure 2 and Appendix A.1 through A.5. 7.2 MORRIS 230 KV TRANSMISSION LINE Approximately four miles of the new Morris 230 kV transmission line will be in South Dakota. The preferred route for this transmission line is south (approximately 1.25 miles) from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to the site for the Big Stone 345 kV Substation, then southeast approximately one mile to U.S. Highway 12, then east into Minnesota along the existing ROW of a 115 kV transmission line. The transmission line will double circuit with and utilize the same route as the existing 115 kV transmission line near the Minnesota River tribut aries to the Minnesota/South Dakota border. 7.3 230 KV TRANSMISSION LINES FROM BIG STONE 230 KV SUBSTATION TO BIG STONE 345 KV SUBSTATION A second 230 kV transmission line will be constructed between the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and the Big Stone 345 kV Substation location. The Big Stone 345 kV Substation will be located approximately 1.25 miles south of the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and about one mile north of U.S. Highway 12. The final site layout will be se lected when other regional facilities are constructed and the transmission system can support a transmission line being energized at 345 kV from this site to Granite Falls. This second 230 kV transmi ssion line will initially be connected only as an extension of the Granite Falls 345 kV line described in Section 7.1. 7.4 BIG STONE 230 KV SUBSTATION UPGRADE The Big Stone 230 kV Substation is located on the so uth side of BSP I, which is west of Big Stone City, in the SW \u00bc of the SE \u00bc of Section 12, Township 121N, Range 47W of Grant County, South Dakota. The substation is owned by Otter Tail, Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., and Northwestern Public Service and operated by Otter Tail. Modifica tions to the substation will include upgrading the existing 4-position ring-bus configuration into a 9-position ring-bus configuration to provide terminations for two new 230 kV transmission lines and a new 230 kV connection to the new generator. This includes installing new transmission line-termination towers, breakers and associated switches and transmission line relaying. The estima ted substation expansion area is 50 feet by 375 feet (0.43 acres) and will require grading and fencing of 60 additional feet to the southern end of the existing station. The control house will likely be expanded as well. A sc hematic of the proposed substation improvements is attached as Appendix B.1.

The substation will be owned by the Applicants and operated by Otter Tail. The subst ation will consist of a 230 kV, three position bus configuration with two 230/345 kV transformers, and a 345 kV two breaker bus configuration. A new control house and a fenced area of approximately 600 x 600 feet or 8.3 acres will be required. A schematic of the proposed substation improv ements is attached as Appendix B.2. 7.6 HANKINSON 230 KV TRANSMISSION LINE RELOCATION The project will also require the relocation of a pproximately 0.9 miles of the Hankinson 230 kV transmission line to the south and west on Big St one property to allow room for the BSP II plant construction. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 19 J ANUARY 12, 2006 8.0 ALTERNATIVE SITES (ARSD 10:22:12) 8.1 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED The Applicants have undertaken extensive studies and modeling exercises over a nearly two year period to identify those transmission options that could best provide transmission outlet from BSP II and increase transmission capability and improv e transmission reliability in the region. The Applicants and several other regional planning utiliti es in need of baseload generation, conducted an initial screening study beginning in late 2003, to address the development of increased transmission capacity necessary to accommodate the proposed sec ond unit at Big Stone. During early 2004, the planners completed a Preliminary Transmission Screening Study for the BSP II Feasibility Study (Screening Study) that determined the transmission costs and performance associated with different output levels of a potential new second unit. To compare each alternative's effectiveness in delivering power from the second unit without d etrimental impacts on the existing transmission system, 11 transmission alternatives were studied. The alternatives were comp ared and ranked based on capital cost, reliability, system power losses, and impacts to known constrained interfaces in the region. Following completion of the Screening Study, those in the Applicant Group responsible for generation resource planning/acquisition submitted to MISO a generation interconnection request for a 600 MW second unit at Big Stone (assign ed project number G392, queue number 38020-01). In April 2004, MISO initiated a meeting with the Applicants and other interested stakeholders to discuss the interconnection request. Based on the past study work for the Project, including the screening Study, the stakeholders selected five transmission interconnection alternatives from the initial 11 alternatives for further analysis. The five alternatives under consideration all in volved construction of a new 230 kV transmission line from Big Stone to Canby and an upgrade of th e existing 115 kV to 230 kV transmission line between Canby and Granite Falls. After discussing the five alternatives at the April 2004 MISO scoping meeting, the participants selected two of the five alternatives for further analysis. One alternative included the upgrade of the 115 kV tr ansmission line to a 230 kV transmission line from Big Stone to the Morris Substation near Morris, Minnesota. The other included a new 230 kV transmission line to Willmar. Both alternatives also included a Big Stone to Granite Falls 230 kV transmission line. After review of additional regiona l studies, the 230 kV transmission line from Big Stone to Granite Falls was upgraded to a 345 kV tr ansmission line to meet future capacity needs. See section 6.0. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 20 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Because Minnesota law requires a utility proposing to construct a 345 kV transmission line to identify both a preferred route and at least one alternative route, two alternatives have been considered for the Granite Falls 345 kV transmis sion line route in South Dakota. The preferred route travels due south for approximately 33 mile s from the Big Stone 345 kV Substation to the north side of Gary, South Dakota where it crosses the Minnesota/South Dakota border and travels east to Granite Falls, Minnesota. The alternative route travels due south of the Big Stone 345 kV Substation approximately five miles where it turns due east to follow 150th Street for approximately two miles to the Minnesota/South Dakota border. The transmission line then travels south in western Minnesota to Canby, Minnesota (Appendix A.6). 8.2 ROUTE IDENTIFICATION The route selection process required a multi-faceted process in which the Applicants considered state and federal requirements and input received at pre-filing public meetings to develop criteria to route the transmission line. Since there are seve ral permitting constraints (state and federal) associated with this Project, it was necessary to consider routes only within the corridors proposed in the federal EIS process for the purposes of this application. The corridors are identified in Figure 1. The preferred routes within the corrido rs were developed by considering the following: Minimize impacts to reliability, develop redundancy Follow existing rights-of-way, when feasible Follow existing rights-of-way, survey lines , natural division lines, and agricultural field boundaries, when feasible Minimize length Minimize cost Avoid populated areas, when feasible Avoid large agricultural facilities Avoid airports and other land use conflicts, and Avoid major environmental features where feasible. The routes were refined to avoid more specific items id entified by the public at the pre-filing public meetings. These items include: BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 21 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Construct the transmission lines near existi ng roadway ROW or close to the half section to minimize impacts to agricultural fields Avoid placing the transmission lines any closer to residences than existing transmission lines in the area. Place structures near roadway ROW or near the section line to allow room for movement of farm equipment. Consider placing poles for H-frame structu res on each side of the 1/2-section line to share the burden between landowners. Avoid diagonal traverses across agricu ltural fields wherever possible. Consider placing poles on landowners preferred side of tree lines wherever practicable. Based on these criteria, analysis of the proposed corridors and constructability considerations, the preliminary routes were selected as described in the following sections. 8.2.1 MORRIS 230KV TRANSMISSION LINE ROUTE The Morris 230 kV transmission line route was selected in part to minimize the congestion near the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and to increase tran smission reliability by separating it from two existing 115 kV transmission lines and an existi ng 230 kV transmission line that run from the substation southeast towards U.S. Highway 12. Th e Morris route travels south from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation approximately 1.25 miles. It th en travels southeast towards Highway 12 where it begins to follow an existing 115 kV corridor to the east to the Minnesota border. To minimize environmental impacts and maximize the distance from the transmission line to nearby homes, the 230 kV transmission line will be double circuited for approximately 0.9 miles near the Minnesota River crossing and the Minnesota/South Dakota border. 8.2.2 230 KV TRANSMISSION LINES FROM THE BIG STONE 230 KV SUBSTATION TO THE BIG STONE 345 KV SUBSTATION The two transmission lines proposed from the Big St one 230 kV Substation to the Big Stone 345 kV Substation location travel southwest to maximize the distance from the existing transmission lines that travel to the southeast from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and to minimize the number of river crossings between the two substations. This alignment also increased the distance between the transmission line and a nearby residence and gravel pit. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 22 J ANUARY 12, 2006 8.2.3 GRANITE FALLS 345 KV TRANSMISSION LINE ROUTE The first consideration for the route was to increa se the transmission capacity in South Dakota to meet future energy demands. The Applicants believe that the facility will promote economic development in the area by enhancing the electric reliability and providing outlets for other generation in eastern South Dakota. During the Energy Conversion Facility Site Permit Application public hearing held on Septembe r 13, 2005, local legislators suppor ted siting the transmission route in South Dakota, highlighting the tremendous potential for wind energy development in Grant and Deuel Counties. Therefore, the preferred route was selected to span the South Dakota Corridor from Big Stone to Gary, South Dakota. The route was identified based on the criteria listed above for each segment as follows: Segment A (5.3 miles): Segment A, which extends from the Big Stone 345 kV Substation to 150th Street, travels near the western edge of the corridor established for the Federal EIS process, to maximize the distance between the route and an existing transmission line that travels nor th-south between the Big Stone 230 kV Substation and the Blair Substation located in Section 16 of Glenwood Township (116N), Range 47W in Deuel County. In an attempt to follow natural division lines and agricultural field boundaries and maximize distances to homes, Segment A was placed on the ha lf section. This placement is located west of 485th Avenue, a possible alternate location, which is populated with several homes. At 148th Street, the route shifts to the west to avoid impacts to the wetlands in Section 6 of Alban Township 120N, Range 47W of Grant County. At 150th Street the route options were restricted by the location of the Cold Spring Granite Quarry. The route was shifted back to 485th Street to avoi d spanning the Quarry and creating impacts for Quarry operations. Segment B (22.6 miles): Segment B parallels the 485th Street ROW south unt il 155th Street where it is shifted west to the half section. This segment alignment was chosen to minimize impacts to nearby residences, United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Prod uction areas and agricultural fields. There is one approximately 90-acre WPA adjacent to Segmen t B, and an additional approximately 185-acre WPA within one mile of Segment B. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 23 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Segment C (4.8 miles): Segment C travels southeast to the Minnesota Bo rder crossing north of Gary, South Dakota. Alternative locations for this segment were limited by homes on County Road 310, USGWS grasslands, the Blair Substation location and existing transmission lines. The cross-country alignment for this segment minimized impacts to nearby homes, maximized the distance from existing transmission facilities, utilized terrain fe atures to bypass existing transmission lines and factored in the shortest distance to the pr eferred Minnesota border crossing area. 8.2.4 GRANITE FALLS 345 KV ALTERNATE ROUTE The alternative route considered travels du e south of the Big Stone 345 kV Substation approximately five miles where it turns due east to follow 150th Street for approximately two miles to the Minnesota/South Dakota border. The transmission line then travels south in western Minnesota to Canby, Minnesota. Options for this route location were limited by the density of housing along 148th and 149th St reets and wetlands between the nor th-south route alignment and the Minnesota/South Dakota border. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 24 J ANUARY 12, 2006 9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION (ARSD 10:22:13) Sections 10 through 17 provide a description of the existing environment at the time of the application submission, estimates of changes in th e existing environment which are anticipated to result from construction and operation of the proposed transmission system, and irreversible changes that are anticipated to remain bey ond the operating lifetime of the facility. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 25 J ANUARY 12, 2006 10.0 EFFECT ON PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT (ARSD 10:22:14) 10.1 EXISTING PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 10.1.1 GEOLOGY The regional geology along the route consists of De s Moines lobe and Superior lobe deposits that overlie Precambrian and Cretaceous bedrock. The project route generally lies northeast of the Co teau des Prairies Plateau, which dominates the regional topography of southwestern Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. The Glacial River Warren floodplain (now occupied by the Minnesota River) defines much of the surficial geology in the region. Unconsolidated deposits in the area include glacial tills with intermittent boulder pavement sequences and abandoned river channel de posits. Patchy glacial lake sediments overlying the local till are present in the area surrounding th e river valley. Localized areas of gravel and sand are observed in former meltwater channels and glac ial lake outlets (Cotter and Bidwell 1966, 1968; Cotter al. 1966, 1968; Novitzki et al. 1969; Van Voast et al. 1972). Currently, during flood events, the Minnesota River deposits silt and fine sand on the floodplain. Unconsolidated sediments overlie bedrock within the vicinity of the route. Bedrock outcrops occur in certain areas along the Minnesota River Valley and parts of the Coteau des Prairies Plateau. Three bedrock units underlay the glacial drift: (1) igne ous and high grade metamorphic rock of Early to Middle Precambrian age; (2) Sioux Quartzite of Late Precambrian ag e; and (3) poorly consolidated marine and continental shales and sandstone of Cretaceous age. The major constituent of the metamorphic rocks is a coarse-grained pink or whi te granite gneiss. Minor rock bodies in this unit are of mafic and/or granitic composition. The Sioux Quartzite is extremely resistant to erosion and therefore forms the underlying core of the high topography of the Coteau des Prairies Plateau and other prominent ridges in the area. The Cretaceo us rocks generally consist of poorly consolidated quartz sands, lignitic clay and soft dark gray shale (Ojakangas and Matsch 1982). The southern half of the South Dakota route lies within the Coteau des Prairies Plateau. The glacial cover in this area consists of approximately 100 to 200 feet of till overlying a thick unit of Cretaceous sediments (approximately 150 feet). The glac ial till is inundated with many surficial and buried sand and gravel lenses. The Cretaceous sedi ments are mainly composed of shale with a lower mantle of sandstone or sand (Cotter and Bidwell 1968; Novitzki et. al. 1969). BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 26 J ANUARY 12, 2006 10.1.2 ECONOMIC DEPOSITS Aggregate sites along the South Da kota route were identified by site reconnaissance and aerial photographs. Governmental database listings of sites are not available at this time. Based on these sources, granite quarries and gravel pits were ma inly identified in the northern portion of the corridor. These include: A gravel pit located in section 13 of Township 121N, Range 47W A granite quarry is located in parts of sections 7, 8, 17, and 18 of Township 120N, Range 47W Rock and/or aggregate mining operations located in section 33 of Township 120N, Range 47W Rock and/or aggregate mining operations located in sections 3, 4, and 10 of Township 119N, Range 47W, The continued expansion of the mined areas is unk nown. No other aggregate sites were identified within one mile of the route. 10.1.3 SOIL TYPE Soils within the transmission line routes can be gr ouped by soil associations. An association is a group of individual soil series that occur tog ether in a characteristic geographic pattern with a distinctive pattern of soils, relief and drainage. Each soil association is typically composed of one or more major soils and one or more minor soil com ponents. Soil associations are defined by each county's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office. Within the facility area, eight soil associations occur: Barnes-Flom-Buse (244), Br andt-Estelline-Fordville (127), (248), Ludden-Lamoure-Ladelle (139) and Peever-Forman-Tonka (136). These associations are described in greater detail below. Barnes-Flom-Buse Association (244): This associati on generally consists of nearly level to hill and steep, poorly drained to well-drained soils that are lo am or clay loam on glacial till. Approximately 1.0 percent of the facility area is in this association Brandt-Estelline-Fordville Association (127): This association generally consists of well-drained soils formed in silty and loamy materials ov erlying sand and gravel on outwash plains. Approximately 6.2 percent of the facility area is in this association. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 27 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Fordville-Renshaw-Southam Association (128): Th is association generally consists of somewhat excessively drained, well-drained and poorly draine d, loamy soils over gravelly material on outwash plains and moraines. Approximately 7.7 percent of the facility area is in this association. Forman-Aastad-Buse Association (135): This associat ion generally consists of nearly level to hilly, well-drained and moderately well-drained soils that are clay loam throughout on glacial till. Approximately 30.6 percent of the facility area is in this association. Heimdal-Sisseton-Svea Association (138): This a ssociation generally consists of well-drained and moderately well-drained soils that formed in loamy glacial drift. Approximately 26.8 percent of the facility area is in this association. Lamoure-La Prairie-Rauville Association (248): This association generally consists of nearly level, moderately well-drained and poorly drained soils on floodplains. Approximately 3.9 percent of the facility area is in this association. Ludden-Lamoure-Ladelle Association ( 139): This association generally consists of poorly or very poorly drained and moderately drained slowly or mo derately slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and silty alluvium on floodplains. Approxima tely 1.2 percent of the facility area is in this association. Peever-Forman-Tonka Association (136): This asso ciation generally consists of well-drained and poorly drained, nearly level to gently sloping, loam y soils formed on till plains. Approximately 22.5 percent of the facility area is in this association. The facility site crosses 47 soil series and is dominated by Forman-Aastad and Heimdal-Sisseton loams and the Peever clay loam. A description of each soil unit is attached as Appendix C. Approximately 60 percent of the land within the tr ansmission line ROW contains soil that is listed as prime farmland; approximately 12 percent of the so il is listed as prime farmland when drained. Prime farmlands are determined by the South Dakota NRCS to have adequate potential of hydrogen (pH), water supply, growing season length an d temperature for growing crops and are not excessively erodible or wet throughout the growing season. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 28 J ANUARY 12, 2006 10.1.4 SEISMIC RISKS The seismic activity in South Dakota, especially in the eastern portions of the state, is fairly low. No earthquakes were recorded in Grant or Deuel Cou nties between 1872 and the present. Two small earthquakes registering near 3 on the Richter Sc ale were recorded in 1934 for Marshall County, located northwest of Grant County, and in 1959 for Spink County, located west of Deuel County. 10.2 FACILITY IMPACTS 10.2.1 POTENTIAL FOR EROSION OR SEDIMENTATION The Grant and Deuel County digital Soil Survey data does not contain information regarding the potential for erosion or sedimentation associated wi th specific soil series. In general, areas with steep slopes, dry soils and/or minimal vegetative cover are at the greatest risk of erosion. Within the facility area, the potential for erosion is highest along steep stream banks along the Whetstone River and Yellow Bank River and their tributaries. Soil un its within the facility area that have moderately steep to steep slopes (nine to 40 percent slopes) include the Buse Loam, the Buse-Barnes loams, the Sioux-Renshaw complex, and the Sisseton Loam. The potential for erosion near the Whetstone and Yellow Bank Rivers during construction will be minimized because construction equipment will not cross the Rivers. In addition, the construction plans will be developed to keep equipment away from these areas. Best management practices (BMP), such as sediment fences and revegetation within steep areas, are proposed to minimize erosion and sedimentation resulting from the facili ty. Specific plans to address these issues will be developed prior to construction, based on the locations of the structures and access roads. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 29 J ANUARY 12, 2006 11.0 GEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION OR HYDROLOGY (ARSD 20:10:22:15) 11.1 EXISTING HYDROLOGY The facility area is in the Minnesota River Basin. A map showing the hydrology of the facility area is attached as Appendix A.7. Within the facility ar ea, the 230 kV transmission lines from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to the Big Stone 345 kV Subs tation cross the Whetstone River. Segment B crosses both the North and South Forks of the Yellow Bank River, Lost Creek and Crow Creek, as well as several smaller tributaries. The Minnesota River Basin drains approximately 15,000 square miles in Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa. The average annual flow of the Minneso ta River, measured at the Ortonville, Minnesota United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging st ation, is approximately 142 cubic feet per second (cfs). Peak flows historically occur in the spri ng and early summer with a maximum flow of 5,070 cfs recorded in April 1997. Low flows occur in December and January. Within the facility area, surface water generally flow s into the Whetstone River, the North and South Forks of the Yellow Bank River or their tributaries, or tributaries to the Lac Qui Parle River where it then flows east to the Minnesota River. Exis ting surface water drainage patterns are shown in Appendix A.7 and is described below. 230 kV Transmission Line to the Big Stone 345 kV Substation The Whetstone River flows east under these segm ents; the proposed transmission line crosses the river once. Surface water flows directly into the river in this portion of the facility. Granite Falls 345 kV Transmission Line Segment A: Within this segment, surface water generally flows east toward tributaries to the North Fork of the Yellow Bank River. The facility cr osses two such tributaries approximately 1,100 feet north of the section line between Sections 17 and 20 in Township 120N, Range 47W. There is a high point approximately at the section line between Sections 8 and 17, Township 120N, Range 47W. From this point, water flows either to the north and east into a channel that runs southeast into the North Fork of the Yellow Bank River, or south and east into another tributary to the Yellow Bank River. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 30 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Segment B: Within this segment, surface water generally flows east into the North and South Forks of the Yellow Bank River and their tributar ies. The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line crosses the North Fork of the Yellow Bank River a pproximately half a mile south of the section line between Sections 29 and 32 in Township 120N, Range 47W. The facility crosses one tributary to the South Fork of the Yellow Bank River approximately 250 feet south of the section line between Sections 29 an d 32 in Township 119N, Range 47W. The proposed facility crosses the South Fork of the Ye llow Bank River approximately half a mile south of the section line between Sections 6 and 7 in To wnship 118N, Range 47W. The facility crosses Mud Creek, a tributary to the South Fork of the Yellow Bank River, approximately 1,200 feet south of the section line between Sections 7 and 18 in Township 118N, Range 47W. The facility crosses Lost Creek, a tributary to the Lac Qui Parle River, approximately half a mile north of U.S. Highway 212. Starting at approximately the U.S. Highway 212 go ing south, the terrain becomes hillier, and many ephemeral tributaries flow under the Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line. Water generally flows east and north through these drainages until it reac hes the Lac Qui Parle River. The facility crosses Crow Timber Creek, a tributary to Lost Creek, approximately 1,000 feet south of the section line between Sections 19 and 30 in Township 117N, Range 47W. Segment C : The terrain is very rolling along this se gment, with ephemeral tributaries to Crow Creek and the Lac Qui Parle River crossing the la ndscape from the southwest to northeast. The facility crosses four tributaries to Crow Creek and four tributaries to the West Fork of the Lac Qui Parle River. Surface water flows from the high poi nts along the route directly into these tributaries along this segment, where it then flows northeast, ultimately joining the Minnesota River. Morris 230 kV Transmission Line The Whetstone River flows east under these segm ents; the proposed transmission line crosses the river once. Surface water flows directly into the river in this portion of the facility. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 31 J ANUARY 12, 2006 11.2 FACILITY IMPACTS 11.2.1 EFFECT ON CURRENT OR PLANNED WATER USE The facility will not require any groundwater for c onsumption or dewatering. The facility will have no impact on either municipal or private water uses in the facility area. No water storage, reprocessing or cooling is required for either th e construction or operation of the facility. The facility will not require deep well injection. 11.2.2 SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER IMPACTS The facility runs across several major rivers/streams in the area and many small tributaries. Erosion of sediment in these surface water bodies from cons truction may occur if BMPs to prevent sediment runoff are not taken; however the Applicants do employ BMPs during facility construction to prevent erosion. The Applicants' standard cons truction practices are summarized in Sections 22.3 and 22.4 and water quality impacts are discussed in S ection 16.2. No impacts to existing drainage patterns are expected as a result of the proposed transmission facility. Isolated groundwater impacts may occur if dewa tering is necessary for the construction of the footings. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 32 J ANUARY 12, 2006 12.0 EFFECT ON TERRESTRIAL ECOS YSTEMS (ARSD 20:10:22:16) 12.1 EXISTING TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM The facility lies within the Northern Glaciated Plai ns Ecoregion. The native vegetation in this ecoregion is transitional between tall and shortgrass prairie. The prairie ecosystem that once dominated the landscape now exists in small isolated sites, such as steep slopes, ditches along road or railroad corridors, and on lands that have not been plowed. The tallgrass prairie has been converted primarily to agricultural related land uses. A few areas dominated by remnant prairie vegetation remain along the route. These areas are detailed in the next section (Section 12.1.1) Potential native vegetation in prairie of the vegetation surrounding the facili ty are cultivated fields, pastureland and field margins populated primarily by invasive or pioneering species such as smooth The route follows existing highway and transmission line corridors for a portion of the route, follows ag ricultural field lines and crosses several natural and altered vegetation community types. A prelimin ary survey conducted by Graham Environmental Services (GES) in June 2005 shows that the pr incipal natural community types encountered along the route include remnant mesic prairie and dry prairie. These classifications are based on the dominant plant community assemblages present at a particular location. The GES Remnant Prairies and Grassland Report is included as Appendix D. Many of the small lakes, streams, and wetlands in the region have been drained, altered, or utilized for agricultural purposes. Three game production areas are located within one mile of the route. There are no state recreation areas, lake-side use areas or state game refuges located near the route. 12.1.1 NATURAL COMMUNITIES 12.1.1.1 Mesic Prairie Mesic prairies are dry to wet-mesi c plant communities dominated by grasses and sedges that are located on level to rolling glacial till. Mesic prairi e communities are fire-dependent and where fire is absent, woody species invade. Big the dominant species with numerous other species of grasses occurring at different levels of dominance based upon moisture availability or BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 33 J ANUARY 12, 2006 disturbance. Invasive species such as Kentucky bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ) and Canada bluegrass ( P. compressa ) occur in varying abundance on these sites de pending upon the level of disturbance at a particular site. Forbs on remnant mesic prairie sites are abundant and have a high level of diversity. Forb communities also vary in diversity and makeup with available soil moisture levels and levels of disturbance. Soils are generally classified as Mollisol s. One mesic prairie remnant is adjacent to each segment of the Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line. 12.1.1.2 Dry Prairie Dry prairies are dry to dry-mesic plant communities that are domina ted by grasses and sedges. Dry prairies are maintained by fire, but require less fre quent fires than mesic prairies due to the droughty conditions where they occur. These dry and poor soil conditions slow the advance of woody species. Generally, dry prairies have a greater component of Great Plains species than remnant mesic prairies. Midheight and short grasses and se dges are usually dominant in remnant most readily identified species observed on remnant dry prairie during a review of the corridor. Inva sive species such as musk ) vary based upon frequency and duration of grazing on these sites. Low shrubs such as leadplant ) were also present in varying amount s. Two dry prairie remnants are adjacent to Segments B and C. 12.1.2 SENSITIVE SPECIES The Applicants contacted the South Dakota Game , Fish and Park (GFP) Department's Natural Heritage Program to request locations of sensitive species near the project area. The South Dakota Natural Heritage Database did not list any occurre nces of state threatened, endangered, rare or special concern terrestrial species within one m ile of the proposed route (special status aquatic species are discussed in Section 13). The South Dakota GFP and the FWS were contacted to identify concerns related to the route (Appendix E). The GFP stated that some of the project area has not been surveyed by GFP for rare species. The FWS also noted the possibility of bald eagle nesting sites. A survey conducted around the Big Stone 230 kV Substation in September 2004 by Barr Engineering identified a Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) nest approximately one and a half mi les northeast of the Big Stone 230 kV Substation, near Big Stone Lake. Nesting season for the bald eagle is between January and August. The Applicants have surveyed the route and have not found any sites that would be impacted. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 34 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Additionally, the FWS noted the possibility for western prairie fringed orchid ( Platanthera praeclara ) to occur in the area. The western prairie fringed orchid is typically found in native tallgrass prairie with sedge/wet meadow habitats. There are no recent r ecords of the western prairie fringed orchid in South Dakota; however, extant populations exist in neighboring states, particularly the southwestern corner of Minnesota, which is near the facility. The FWS also stated that Dakota skippers ( Hesperia dacotae ), a federal candidate species of butterfly, have been located near the project area, and could occur in any high quality prairie remnants. The Applicants will minimize impacts to the terre strial ecosystems. The majority of the proposed facility follows existing roadways or agricultural field lines, which are habitats that have been previously disturbed. Although the facility is with in 1,000 feet of surveyed native prairie remnants, all the remnants are less than 1, 000 feet wide and no structures will be placed in this habitat, as practicable. There is minimal potential for the displacement of wildlife and loss of habitat from construction of the facility. Wildlife that inhabits natural area s, such as those near water bodies or the prairie remnants could be impacted in th e short-term within the immediate area of construction. The distance that animals will be displaced will depend on the species. Animals in the area will be typical of those found in agricultural and urban settings and should not incur population level effects due to construction. No special status species were obser ved in any of the natural community types within one mile of the route during the GES June 2005 survey which included a preliminary sensitive species survey. A special status species survey, which will concentrate on the preferred route alignment, is planned to be c onducted in 2006. (Appendix D). The Applicants will maintain sound water and so il conservation practices during construction and operation of the project to protect topsoil and adja cent water resources and minimize soil erosion and sedimentation. Raptors, waterfowl and other bird species may also be affected by the construction and placement of the transmission lines. Avian collisions are a possi bility after the completi on of the transmission line. Waterfowl are typically more susceptible to transmission line collision, especially if the transmission line is placed between agricultural fi elds that serve as feeding areas, or between wetlands and open water, which serve as resting areas. Electrocution occurs when birds with large wingspan s come in contact with either two conductors or a conductor and a grounding device. The Applicants' transmission line design standards provide BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 35 J ANUARY 12, 2006 adequate spacing to eliminate the risk of raptor el ectrocution. As such, electr ocution is not a concern related to the facility. The primary methods the Applicants use to addres s avian issues for transmission projects include: Working with the GFP to identify any area s that may require marking transmission line shield wires and/or to use alternate structures to reduce collisions; Attempting to avoid areas known as major flyways or migratory resting spots. The Applicants will continue to work with the FWS and GFP to determine if there are areas that should be marked when the transmission line is co nstructed. The area of the project most likely to be in a major flyway is at the northern end near the Minnesota River.

The FWS National Wetlan d Inventory (NWI) maps indicate that there are 36 wetlands along the 345 kV Granite Falls route, 28 of which are crossed by the route. Along the 230 kV transmission line from the Big Stone 23 0 kV Substation to Minnesota, there are five wetlands depicted on NWI mapping, none of which are crossed. NWI wetland areas are shown on the area hydrology map attached as Appendix A.7. These wetlands are primarily palustrine wetlands, although several are associated with river systems. None of these wetlands is greater than 800 feet across; the average crossing wi dth is approximately 200 feet. The South Dakota Natural Heritage Database lis ted several occurrences of state threatened, endangered, rare or special concern aquatic species within one mile of the facility. All of the listed species are associated with surface waterbodies such as the Whetstone and Yellow Bank Rivers. Table 5 lists the special status species located within one mile of the facility.

Maintaining water quality during construction throughout the facility will minimize potential impacts to rare and common aquatic organisms and the aquatic environment. The Applicants will avoid major disturbance of individual wetlands and drainage systems during construction. All wetlands along the facility co rridor can be spanned by the transmission lines, which will have average spans of 700 to 800 feet, and a maximu m span of 1,000 feet. No construction will occur within the Whetstone Rive r, the North or South Forks of the Yellow Bank River, Mud Creek, Lost Creek, Crow Creek or the West Fork of the Lac Qui Parle River streambeds. These waterways will be spanned by the transmi ssion lines; however construction may impact areas adjacent to these streambeds. The Applicants will also implement appropriate BMPs to minimize the amount of erosion and sedimentation that could potentially impact wet lands and waterways. Temporary erosion and sediment control methods will be properly placed , monitored and maintained adjacent to water resources. These erosion control methods will remain in place until work areas become re-vegetated or are stable. BMPs may include silt fencing, mu lching, seeding and hay bales. Where appropriate, the Applicants will re-vegetate disturbed areas. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 39 J ANUARY 12, 2006 14.0 LAND USE (ARSD 20:10:22:18) 14.1 EXISTING LAND USE Land use in the facility area has traditionally been largely agricultural with a mixture of row crops and pastureland. A land cover map is attached as Appendix A.8. and a map from the Grant County Comprehensive Plan showing Grant County land use de signations is attached as Appendix F.1. The Deuel County Comprehensive Plan does not contain any land use maps, although it is clear that aside from the city of Gary, the vast majority of the facility within Deuel County is agricultural (Appendix F.2). In Grant County, the northern portion of the facili ty crosses areas of several different existing and planned land uses, according to the 2004 Gran t County Comprehensive Plan (Appendix F.1). A portion of the corridor outside Big Stone City is zoned as an area of development transition, meaning the County anticipates a change from the ex isting land use. The majority of the corridor is zoned for agricultural uses. In addition to the agricultural and rural residential land uses that dominate the facility area, there are pockets of commercial and industrial land use near Big Stone City. The existing Big Stone Plant site and Big Stone 230 kV Substation ar e zoned for industrial use. Currently, the proposed site for the Big Stone 345 kV Substation is zoned for agricultural use. 14.2 LAND USE IMPACTS The facility will be located primarily on private land that is zoned as agricultural, and regulated by Grant and Deuel County land use plans and ordina nces. The only publicly owned land directly affected by the facility is roadway ROW. The fu ture site of the Big Stone 345 kV Substation will require rezoning. No other land use changes w ill occur beyond the immediate footprint of the facility. The facility is compatible with the existing land uses in the area. The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line route parallels roadways for five of the 33-mile length. Pole placement siting in areas where cross-country ROW is necessary has been planned to minimize impacts to farming operations. The 230 kV transmission line route follo ws an existing transmission line corridor from U.S. Highway 12 to the Minnesota border. There will be some short-term impacts to agricult ure from construction. Once the transmission line is in operation, only approximately 0.7 acres w ill be permanently removed from agricultural BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 40 J ANUARY 12, 2006 production in order to accommodate the foundations for the preferred two pole H-frame structures. Agricultural impacts are discussed in Section 19.2.2. 14.2.1 DISPLACEMENT No homes or businesses will be displaced by the fa cility. The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line route comes within 1,000 feet of fifteen homes; the nearest of these homes is approximately 260 feet from the transmission line. The 230 kV transmi ssion line route comes within 1000 feet of six residences; the nearest of these homes is approximately 270 feet. The 230 kV transmission line from the Big Stone 230 kV Substation to the 345 kV Substation comes within 1,000 feet of one home, as the home is approximately 850 feet away. 14.2.2 NOISE Noise is defined as unwanted sound. It may be comprised of a variety of sounds of different intensities across the entire frequency spectrum. Noise is measured in units of decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale. Because human hearing is not equally sensitive to all frequencies of sound, cer tain frequencies are given more \"weight.\" The A- weighted decibel (dBA) scale corresponds to the sens itivity range for human hearing. Noise levels capable of being heard by humans are measured in dBA. A noise level change of 3 dBA is barely perceptible to average human hearing. A 5 dBA change in noise level, however, is clearly noticeable. A 10 dBA change in noise levels is perceived as a doubling or halving of noise loudness, while a 20 dBA change is considered a dramatic change in lo udness. Table 6 shows noise levels associated with common, everyday sources and places the magnitud e of noise levels discussed here in context. TABLE 6 COMMON NOISE SOURCES AND LEVELS Sound Pressure Level (dBA) Typical Sources 120 Jet aircraft takeoff at 100 feet 110 Same aircraft at 400 feet 90 Motorcycle at 25 feet 80 Garbage disposal 70 City street corner 60 Conversational speech 50 Typical office 40 Living room (without TV) 30 Quiet bedroom at night Source: Environmental Impact Analysi s Handbook, ed. by Rau and Wooten, 1980 BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 41 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Noise concerns for this project may be associated with both the construction and operation of the energy transmission system. Transmission conducto rs and transformers at substations produce audible noise under certain conditions. The level of noise or its loudness depends on conductor conditions, voltage level and weather conditions . Noise emission from a transmission line occurs during heavy rain and wet conductor conditions. In foggy, damp, or rainy weather conditions, transmission lines can create a subtle crackling sound due to the small amount of electricity ionizing the moist air near the wires. During heavy rain, th e general background noise level is usually greater than the noise from a transmission line. In additi on, very few people are out near the transmission line during rainstorms. For these reasons, audible noi se is not noticeable during heavy rain. During light rain, dense fog, snow and other times when there is moisture in the air, the proposed transmission lines will produce audible noise higher than rural background levels but similar to household background levels. During dry weather, audible noise from transmission lines is a faint, sporadic crackling sound. The primary land use in the project area is rural ag ricultural land. Typical noise sensitive receptors near the facility may include residences, churches , schools and parks where either sleep or outdoor activities occur. Current average noise levels in th ese areas are typically in the 30 to 40 dBA range and are considered acceptable for residential land use activities. Ambient noise in rural areas is commonly made up of rustling vegetation and infr equent vehicle pass-bys. Higher ambient noise levels, typically 50 to 60 dBA, will be expected near roadways, urban areas, and commercial and industrial properties in the project area. It is not expected that noise from the facility will exceed the typical background noise levels in the project area. 14.2.3 AESTHETICS The visual character and quality along the route are characterized by open agricultural fields to rolling hills broken by small lakes and wetland comple xes. Dispersed residential areas and existing transmission lines are also part of the human-made el ements in the vicinity of the facility. Within the project area, the dominant visual characteristic is agri cultural land, encompassing over 90 percent of the land use. The highest elevations in the proj ect area occur around the Coteau de s Prairies Plateau, located in Deuel County. Along the Minnesota and South Dakota border, there are several areas of federal and state managed lands. The northwest portion of the facility will be adjacent to Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge, located along the Minnesota River. The visual characteristics of these lands are rock outcroppings, rolling hills, grasslands and wetlands. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 42 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Other landscape features are the North Fork of the Whetstone River and South Fork of the Yellow Bank River in Grant County, listed in the National Park Service Nationwide Ri vers. These rivers are narrow riparian areas in an agricultural setting. The degree to which the transmission line will be visi ble will vary by location. The Applicants have not identified any unique aesthetic resources th at would be impacted by this transmission line. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 43 J ANUARY 12, 2006 15.0 LOCAL LAND USE CONTROLS (ARSD 20:10:22:19) The majority of the facility will be constructed on agricultural land regulated by Deuel and Grant Counties pursuant to their land use plans and or dinances (Appendix F). The Big Stone 345 kV Substation will require rezoning from agricultural to industrial land use. Construction of the transmission line and substation will require a building permit from Deuel County and Grant County, South Dakota. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 44 J ANUARY 12, 2006 16.0 WATER QUALITY (ARSD 20:10:22:20) 16.1 EXISTING WATER RESOURCES The National Park Service (NPS) lists the North and South Forks of the Whetstone River on its Nationwide Rivers Inventory (NRI). The NRI li sts over 3,400 river segments that the NPS has determined have \"outstandingly remarkable\" natura l or cultural resources. Categories used to determine eligible river segments include: scenery, recreation, geology, fish, wildlife, prehistory, history, cultural values and others. The North Fork is listed for scenic, fishery, and wildlife values; the South Fork is listed for scenic, recreational, geol ogic, wildlife, historic and cultural values. Under a 1979 Presidential Directive, federal agencies ne ed to seek to avoid and mitigate impacts to NRI riverways. The Clean Water Act requires states to publish, ev ery two years, a list of streams and lakes that are not meeting their designated uses because of exce ss pollutants (impaired waters). The list, known as the 303(d) list, is based on violations of water qua lity standards. Impaired wa ters require studies to determine the total amount of pollution, or tota l maximum daily load (TMDL), that a water body can receive before water quality standards are viola ted. The South Fork of the Whetstone River is listed on the 303(d) list within the Facility Project Area for ammonia, organic enrichment and low dissolved oxygen. The river is considered impaired for meeting the South Dakota Department of Environmental and Natural Resources' (DENR) warmwater marginal fish life use, due to low dissolved oxygen levels resulting from municipal disc harge. All other rivers in the facility area are considered to fully support the DENR's designated uses, and are not impaired. 16.2 FACILITY IMPACTS AND MITIGATION During construction there is the possibility of se diment reaching surface waters as the ground is disturbed by excavation, grading and construction tr affic. This could potentially affect water quality if the erosion is not controlled; however, the App licants will employ BMPs to prevent sedimentation and introduction of sediment and pollutants to surface waterbodies during construction. The Applicants will maintain sound water and soil conservation practices during construction and operation of the facility to protect topsoil and adja cent water resources and mi nimize soil erosion. Practices may include containing excavated material, protecting exposed soil and stabilizing restored soil. The facility is not expected to affect ammonia, organic matter or dissolved oxygen levels within the watersheds. Once the facility is completed, it will have no impact on surface water quality. Temporary impacts to wetlands may occur if these areas need to be crossed during construction of the transmission line. The Applicants will avoid any wetland crossings where feasible; wherever BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 45 J ANUARY 12, 2006 crossings are necessary the Applic ants will attempt to minimize tem porary impacts by constructing that portion of the facility during the winter and using mats when feasible. All wetlands along the facility corridor can be spanned by the transmissi on lines, which will have average spans of 700 to 800 feet, and a maximum span of 1,000 feet. No permanent impacts to wetlands are anticipated. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 46 J ANUARY 12, 2006 17.0 AIR QUALITY (ARSD 20:10:22:21) 17.1 EXISTING AIR QUALITY Deuel and Grant Counties are in compliance with both National and Sout h Dakota Ambient Air Quality Standards. State and Federal Ambient Air Quality monitoring sites are sparse in the facility area. This is primarily due to the lack of significant emission sources in the area. The primary emission sources that exist near the facility include agriculture and grain processing facilities and small to medium sized manufacturing facilities. 17.2 FACILITY IMPACTS During construction of the facility, limited fugiti ve emissions from construction related equipment and ROW clearing are expected to occur. The im pact from these emissions is expected to be minimal. Construction emission impacts are highly dependent on weather conditions and the specific activity occurring. Primary emissions from these activities will include fugitive dust and diesel combustion emissions. These are expected to have minimal impa cts on their surroundings due to the limited and intermittent nature of these activities. Once the transmission line is operational, there will be minor amounts of ozone generated from the transmission line. The national standard for oz one is 0.08 parts per million on an eight-hour averaging period. Calculations, using the Bonne ville Power Administration (BPA) Corona and Field Effects Program Version 3 for a standard single circuit 345 kV transmission line, predicted the maximum concentration of 0.008 ppm near the conductor and 0.0003 ppm at one meter above ground during foul weather or worst-case conditions (rain at four inches pe r hour). During a mist rain (rain at 0.01 inch per hour) the maximum c oncentrations decreased to 0.0003 ppm near the conductor and 0.0001 ppm at one meter above ground level. For both cases, these conservative calculations of ozone levels are well below the fede ral standards. Studies designed to monitor the production of ozone under transmission lines have ge nerally been unable to detect any increase due to the transmission line facility. Given this, ther e will be no measurable im pacts relating to ozone for the facility.

All data from Census 2000. 19.1.2 AGRICULTURE Within Deuel and Grant Counties, more than 90 per cent of the land is used for agriculture. The number of full-time farms in Deuel County decrease d by 3 percent from 1997 to 2002. The average farm size increased by 2 percent to 562 acres. Crop sales in 2002 were $22,325,000 (34 percent of agricultural products sold in the County) and livesto ck sales were $43,409,000 (66 percent). Crops in Deuel County are primarily corn, soybeans and wheat. Livestock sold is primarily cattle and hogs. In Grant County, the number of full-time farms increased by 3 percent from 1997 to 2002. The average farm size decreased by 5 percent to 67 2 acres. Crop sales in 2002 were $39,309,000 (48 percent of agricultural products sold in th e County) and livestock sales were $42,867,000 (52 percent). Crops in Grant County are primarily co rn, soybeans and wheat. Livestock sold is primarily cattle and hogs. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 49 J ANUARY 12, 2006 19.1.3 TRANSPORTATION The transportation network that may be used to develop and operate this project is comprised of largely rural \"farm-to-market\" or section line roadways with various county and trunk highways. No urban areas exist within the facility area. Various active railroad lines are also present within the facility area. The facility is located in rural areas served by hi ghways with relatively low traffic volume. The capacity of any roadway is dependent on many fa ctors, as documented in the Highway Capacity Manual. Based on typical peak hour percentages, trucks, terrain and access spacing, the functional capacity of a rural two-way two-lane highway is between 4,000 and 6,000 vehicles per day. A summary of the average daily traffic on an annualized basis is documented in Table 8. TABLE 8 EXISTING AVERAGE ANNUAL DAILY TRAFFIC (AADT) Highway Route Jurisdiction AADT State Highway 158 SDDOT 135 State Highway 20 SDDOT 260 U.S. Highway 212 SDDOT 1,650 U.S. Highway 12 SDDOT 2,800 State Highway 101 SDDOT 405 State Highway 22 SDDOT 630 Source: County Highway AADT Map(s) Given the functional capacity limits of 4,000 to 6, 000 vehicles per day (vpd), congestion is not a primary factor on any of the roadways within the project area. 19.1.3.1 Railroad Two active railroad lines intersect the facility, as documented in Table 9. Temporary and permanent easements for both construction and utility line operation will be required by BNSF Railway Company. Construction activities will be regula ted and any impacts to rail service will require approval by the carrier.

The results include counts of known cultural resources and provide general information on those fe atures identified during a Public Land Survey (PLS) map review. For more detailed descriptions of these resources and the study area, please refer to the cultural resources overview prepared by Palmer et al. (2005). 19.1.4.1 Data Collection Methods Otter Tail sponsored an overview of known cultural resources within the study area (Palmer et al. 2005). For this overview, Otter Tail reques ted previous survey data and information on known archaeological resources in the pr oject area from the Archaeological Research Center in Rapid City, South Dakota. PLS maps from the Montana/Da kota Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Field Office in Billings, Montana were also acquired. General Land Office (GLO) maps were collected from the BLM. Otter Tail also consulted the Ar chaeological Resources Management System and Cultural Resources Geographic Research Information Display (CRGRID) databases available on the web from the South Dakota Historical Society in the City of Pierre. Otter Tail also sponsored a windshield survey of selected portions of the corridor. During the survey, all townships were visited, and selected buildings within the corridors were photographed. 19.1.4.2 Affected Environment The three-mile wide study area travels thro ugh Grant (Big Stone, Al ban, Vernon and Adams townships) and Deuel counties (Herrick, Glen wood and Antelope Valley townships) in South Dakota. Briefly, the review of existing cultural re sources documentation identified 15 archaeological resources and 14 historic standing structures within the study area. (Appendix G) These resources have been described in 17 cultural resource docu mentations and management reports (Palmer et al. 2005). BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 51 J ANUARY 12, 2006 The following is an analysis of those resources in the immediate vicinity of the route. The route crosses four archaeological resources, all of th em being railroad corridors (39DE2003, 39GT2000, 39GT2007, 39GT2015) (Appendix G) . Two of these corridors are currently operated by BNSF Railway Corporation, namely the Benson-Aberdeen Main Line segment (39GT2000) and the Appleton-Yale Branch Line segment (39GT2007). All of these active and abandoned railroad corridors are eligible for listing on the National Re gister of Historic Places (NRHP). No other previously identified archaeological reso urces are within 500 feet of the route. Eleven previous inventoried standing structures (10 of which are in the City of Gary) are within one mile of the route (Appendix G). Three of these structures (in the City of Gary) are listed on the NRHP. Four other structures in Gary are eligib le for listing on the NRHP. The remaining four structures, including a bridge in Antelope Valley To wnship, are not eligible for listing on the NRHP. The 19th century (1860s to 1880s) PLS maps illustra te the Euroamerican history of the study area and provide some basis for the types of historic-p eriod cultural resources that are expected in the vicinity. For example, the PLS map of Herrick Township (with a survey completed in 1872) shows the Winona and St. Peter Railroad (later known as the Chicago Northwestern Railroad and recorded as such as 39GT2003) that travels through Sections 3, 4 and 10 through the City of Gary (and not yet established on the map). The 1872 survey of Glenwood Township identified one unlabeled trail/road and the continuation of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad (later Chicago Northwestern Railroad). In addition, the 1860s PLS maps fo r Alban and Big Stone townships show multiple trails/roads, numerous farms/structures, and the Chi cago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (recorded as 39GT2007). 19.2 SOCIOECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY IMPACTS 19.2.1 COMMUNITY IMPACTS The facility will not have a significant short-term adverse impact on population, income, occupational distribution nor on the integration or cohesion of communities in the facility area. There will be some long-term beneficial impacts from the new transmission lines. These benefits include an increase to the counties' tax base resul ting from the incremental increase in revenues from utility property taxes, which are based on the va lue of the facility. The availability of reliable power in the area will have a positive effect on loca l businesses and the quality of service provided to the general public. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 52 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Although the facility owners will pay taxes on the facility and the facility will increase Deuel County's and Grant County's tax base, the facility will not result in any significant impact to the affected taxing jurisdiction. 19.2.2 AGRICULTURAL IMPACT The facility will create impacts to farmland along th e route; no impacts are anticipated to livestock operations. However, these impacts will be minimal and will occur primarily due to pole placement. During construction, temporary impacts such as soil compaction and crop damages within the ROW are likely to occur. Approximately 304 acres of agricultural land will be impacted temporarily by the facility. This temporary impact is from temporary roads and staging areas located along the length of the route to allow construction access to the facility. Permanent impacts to agricultural lands will result in areas where pol es are placed an d are estimated to total approximately 0.7 acres of the project area. Wherever possible, poles will be placed so that they closely follow the roadway ROW, minimizing permanent impacts to agricultural land. To mini mize loss of farmland and ensure reasonable access to the land near the poles, the Applicants intend to place the poles within 15 feet of the road ROW. Pole placement on cross-country ROW will be si ted to allow area for farmers to maneuver equipment around the poles. 19.2.3 TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS The facility will not result in any permanent impacts to the area's transportation resources. There may be some temporary impacts to local roads duri ng the construction phase of the facility. The Applicants will work with Grant and Deuel Counties to minimize any impacts to area transportation from the facility. There will be no impacts to the rail infrastructu re, as the facility will span the BNSF Railway Company, Benson to Aberdeen mainline and Appleton to Yale branch railroad line. 19.3 CULTURAL RESOURCE IMPACTS The proposed project will require the preparation of an EIS directed by Western. In addition, Western will also function as the lead federal agency for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Western is currently preparing a Programmatic Agreement (PA) to guide the Section 106 compliance process throughout the project, particularly with regard to a definition of Area of Potential Effects (APE) once the routes for the transmission lines are determined. While the EIS will compare the corridors, the consulting parties BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 53 J ANUARY 12, 2006 to the PA understand that the selection of actual transmission line routes will be a function of the PUC of the State of South Dakota in response to th is application. The APE, to be agreed upon in the PA, will be applied to these routes; the APE will be subject to a Phase I cultural resources inventory (i.e. field investigation). The Applicants' archaeologists will design a survey methodology to document the existing conditions within the APE, identify existing arch aeological resources within that area (including previously inventoried properties), provide recomme ndations for National Register eligibility of identified cultural resources within the APE, an d offer recommendations for archaeological site avoidance, impact minimization, or mitigation if necessary. Also, the Applicants' architectural historians will design a methodology to identified properties within the APE for visual effects (as proposed in the PA) and assess impacts to NRH P-listed or eligible standing structures. The Applicants will make every effort to avoid adve rse effects to NRHP-eligible cultural resources. In the event that an impact would occur, Wester n would determine the nature of the impact in consultation with the South Dakota SHPO and invited consulting parties (particularly Native American Tribes and other state and federal permitti ng or land management agencies) on whether or not the resource was eligible for listing in the Nati onal Register of Historic Places (NRHP). While avoidance of the resource would be a preferred action, mitigation for project-related impacts on NRHP-eligible cultural resources may include an effort to minimize project impacts on the resource and/or additional documentation through data recovery. Western will integrate into the PA a discovery pl an to be in place should previously unknown archaeological resources or human remains be in advertently encountered during construction along the route. The plan will outline the framework for handling such discoveries in an efficient and legally compliant manner. The discovery plan ma y include the following topics: construction contractor training, identification of resources in the field, contact information for Otter Tail- designated professionals to address discovery, pro cedures for avoidance, and associated tasks in the event of work stoppage in a cons truction area. With regard to a discovery of human remains, procedures would be followed to ensure that th e appropriate authorities would become involved quickly and in accordance with local and state guidelines (SDCL Chapter 34-27). BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 54 J ANUARY 12, 2006 20.0 EMPLOYMENT ESTIMATES (ARSD 20:10:22:24) Construction activity for the Big Stone Transm ission project would require approximately 40 personnel. Of the 40 personnel, approximately 25 employees will be needed during transmission line construction and 15 workers will be required for substation construction. Additionally, part- time personnel may also be need ed during the construction of th e project. The estimated annual expenditures by job classification are listed in Table 10. TABLE 10 ANNUAL EMPLOYMENT EXPENDITURES BY JOB CLASSIFICATIONS Job Classification Annual Expenditure Linemen $2.7 Million Earthmovers $250,000 Building Construction $250,000 Relay Technicians $225,000 Electrical Technicians $575,000 It is anticipated that the substation workers, other than the earthmovers, will be employees from the Otter Tail substation construction workforce. A port ion of the linemen are also anticipated to come from the Applicants' field crews to construct the 115 kV and 230 kV transmission lines and possibly the 345 kV transmission lines. Those linemen posit ions that cannot be filled by the Applicants will be contracted out. The level of skill and traini ng required for constructing transmission lines will limit the numbers of workers hired locally. After completion of construction, operation and maintenance of the facility will likely be pr ovided by existing Otter Tail employees. The relatively short-term nature of the project c onstruction and the number of workers who will be hired from outside of the project area should re sult in short-term positive economic impacts in the form of increased spending on lodging, meals and other consumer goods and services. It is not anticipated that the project will create new perm anent jobs, but it will create temporary construction jobs that will provide a one-time influx of income to the area. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 55 J ANUARY 12, 2006 21.0 FUTURE ADDITIONS AND MODIFICATIONS (ARSD 20:10:22:25) The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line will opera te at 230 kV until future transmission system upgrades are completed which will allow this fa cility to be uprated. The Big Stone 345 kV Substation will be constructed prior to energizing the line from 230 kV to 345 kV. Refer to Section 7.5, Big Stone 345 kV Substation, for the general site description. The Applicants considered whether a 345 kV transmission line was warranted for either the City of Morris or the City of Willmar. At this time ther e is not sufficient evidence to warrant building a transmission line of that size to either location. The Applicants assume that there will be minor system upgrades needed in the future, but current MISO studies have not identified any additional n ecessary modifications that will result from this project. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 56 J ANUARY 12, 2006 22.0 TRANSMISSION FACILITY L AYOUT AND CONSTRUCTION (ARSD 20:10:22:34) 22.1 ROUTE CLEARING During the acquisition process, individual property owners will be advised as to the construction schedules, needed access to the site and any vegetation clearing required for the facility. To maintain North American Energy Reliability Council (NERC) reliability standards, the ROW will be cleared of the amount of vegetation necessary to construct, operate and maintain the facility. Clear cutting, (i.e. the removal of all trees, brush and other low- growing vegetation), will be used at construction and maintenance access roads and at structure erecti on sites. Danger trees outside of the ROW will also be removed. Danger trees are those trees wh ich could, in falling, hit the transmission line. Other trees, which are decayed or leaning or may b ecome a potential hazard to the transmission line, will also be removed. Disposal of timber, tree tops , limbs and slash will comply with state and local ordinances. Wood from the clearing operation will be offered to the landowner or removed from the site. 22.2 TRANSMISSION CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES Once access to the land is granted, site preparation begins in coordination with landowners. This includes clearing the ROW of vegetation that would interfere with the safe operation of the transmission line. Any vegetation that would pr event construction may also be removed. Additionally, underground utilities are identified in cooperation with local utility companies to minimize conflicts to the existing utilities along the routes. All mater ials resulting from the clearing operations will either be chipped on site or stacked in the ROW with landowner agreement for their use. If temporary removal or relocation of fen ces is necessary, installation of temporary or permanent gates would be coordinated with the la ndowner. The ROW agent also works with the landowners for early harvest of crops where po ssible. During the construction process, the Applicants may ask the property owner to remove or relocate equipment and livestock from the ROW. Transmission line structures are generally designed for installation at existing grades. Therefore, structure sites will not be graded or leveled, unless it is necessary to provide a reasonably level area for construction access and activities. For exampl e, minor grading might be performed where the immediate terrain near the structure is such that vehicle or installation equipment could not safely access or perform construction operations properly. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 57 J ANUARY 12, 2006 The Applicants have standard construction and mitigation practices that were developed from experience with past practices as well as industry specific Best Management Practices (BMPs). These BMPs address ROW clearance, erecting transmission line structures and stringing transmission lines. BMPs for each specific project are based on the proposed schedules for activities, prohibitions, maintenance guidelines, inspection procedures and ot her practices. In some cases these activities, such as schedules, are modified to incorporate BMP construction that will assist in minimizing impacts for sensitive environments. Contractors ar e advised of these BMP requirements during the bid process. For facilities that will have the structures directly embedded in the ground, the structures will be erected by auguring or excavating a hole typically 10 to 15 feet deep and 3 to 4 feet in diameter for each pole. Any excess soil from the excavation will be offered to the landowner or removed from the site. The steel or wood structures will then be set and the holes back-filled with the excavated material or with native soil or crushed rock. In poor soil cond itions, a galvanized steel culvert is sometimes installed vertically with the structure set inside . Other facilities may require the use of concrete foundations. The size of the hole for concrete fo undations depends largely on soil type. Based on the known soil types in eastern South Dakota, it is anticipated that the average structure depth would be approximately 12 feet deep. Drilled pi er foundations may vary from 4 to 8 feet in diameter. Concrete trucks are normally used to brin g the concrete in from a local concrete batch plant. Steel structures are delivered to a staging area, wh ich are located approximately every 25 miles along the route, which occupy approximately one acre of land. At the staging area, steel structure sections are connected, the arms are attached , and the structure is then loaded onto a structure trailer. The structure is delivered to the staked location and pl aced within the ROW until the structure is set. Insulators and other hardware are attached while the steel structure is on the ground. The structure is then lifted and placed in the ground for direct buried structures. Structures that cannot be direct buried are secured on the foundation by crane. In some cases temporary lay down areas may be required. These areas will be selected based on their location, access, security and ability to efficiently and safely warehouse supplies. The areas are chosen so minimal excavation and grading is needed. The temporary lay down areas that ar e outside of the transmission line ROW will be obtained from affected landowners through rental agreements. Wood structures are also delivered to a staging ar ea. When the transmission line runs parallel with a roadway, wood structures may be placed at the stak ed location. This occurs when there is room to leave the structure and adequate access to drop off the structure until it is installed. When wood BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 58 J ANUARY 12, 2006 structures are located away from roadways, they are sorted at the staging area and loaded onto structure trailers for delivery to the staked loca tion. Because the wood structures weigh less, several wood structures can be placed on the trailer for each delivery. Insulators and other hardware are attached to the structure while it is on the ground, then a line truck lifts and places it. After structures have been erected, conductors ar e installed by establishing stringing setup areas within the ROW. These stringing setup areas ar e usually located every two miles along a project route and usually occupy approximately 15,000 sq uare feet of land. Conductor stringing operations also require brief access to each structure to secure the conductor wire to the insulators or to install shield wire clamps once final sag is established. Temporary guard or clearance structures are installed as needed over existing distribution or communi cation lines, streets, roads, highways, railways or other obstructions, after any necessary notifications are made or permits obtained. This ensures that conductors will not obstruct traffic or contact exis ting energized conductors or other cables. In addition, the conductors are protected from damage. During construction, the most effective means to minimize impacts to water areas will be to span all streams and rivers with structures. In addition, the Applicants will not allow construction equipm ent to be driven across waterways except under special circumstances and after discussion with the appropriate resource agency. Where waterways must be crossed to pull in the new conductors and shield wires, workers may walk across, use boats, or drive equipment across ice in the winter. In ar eas where construction occurs close to waterways, BMPs help prevent soil erosion and ensure that equipment fueling and lubricating occur at a distance from waterways. 22.3 SUBSTATION CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES Once the final design is complete and necessary property is acquired, construction will begin. A detailed construction schedule will be developed ba sed upon availability of crews, outage restrictions for any transmission lines that may be affected, weath er conditions, spring load restrictions on roads and any restrictions placed on certain areas for mi nimizing permanent impacts from construction. Substation upgrades involve replacing existing e quipment with new equipment. All construction work occurs within the existing substation prope rty unless expansion of the site is necessary. Construction of a new facility begins with site prep aration work, which involves grading and leveling the site with heavy equipment to support electrical equipment and the control house. This may or may not include replacement of site soils dependin g on existing soil cond itions found and those identified in the Soil Exploration Report. Topsoil will be removed, stockpile d and re-spread onsite. Any excess soil will be offered to the landowner or re moved from the site. Once the site is graded, a perimeter fence, typically chain link, is installed to secure the site. All substation equipment will be contained within the fenced area. Concrete foundations are then placed throughout the substation BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 59 J ANUARY 12, 2006 pad to support the substation equipment. A control house is constructed to house the protective relaying and control equipment. Erection of steel structures follows the foundation installation. These structures are built using rolled I-beams and/or tubular steel materials. Beams are used for mounting electrical conductors, disconnects and equipment. Bare copper conductor is buried around the perimeter of the fence and within the fe nce to properly ground all of the equipment and provide safety of personnel. Large high-voltage equi pment, such as circuit breakers and transformers with associated control cables, are installed followi ng completion of these steel structures. The final step is to properly test and commission each electrical device. The Applicants will provide erosion control method s to be implemented to minimize runoff during substation construction and since the projects w ill likely impact more than one acre, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit will be acquired, as necessary. Additionally, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Pl an (SWPPP) will be implemented in compliance with the NPDES and if necessary, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan will be developed or updated, as applicable. Contractors will be committed to safe working pr actices, maintaining property and equipment in safe working condition and requiring compliance wi th all applicable safety rules, practices and procedures. Substations will be designed in compliance with the applicable requirements of Rural Utilities Service (RUS), National Electrical Saf ety Code (NESC), Occupati onal Safety and Health (OSH) Act (29 CFR 1910) and local regulations. Su bstations will be reviewed for local conditions, and will include provisions in design beyond the minimum provisions for safety established in the various regulatory codes, where warranted. Substa tion designs will allow future maintenance to be accomplished with a minimum impact on substation operation and allow adequate clearance to work safely. 22.4 RESTORATION PROCEDURES During construction, limited ground disturbance at the structure sites may occur. The construction contractor establishes a main staging area for secu re, temporary storage of materials and equipment. Typically, a previously disturbed or developed area is used. Such an area includes sufficient space to lay down material and pre-assemble some structu re components or hardware. Other staging areas located along the ROW are limited to the structure site areas for structure lay down and framing, prior to structure installation. Additionally, st ringing setup areas are used to store conductors, stringing equipment and other stringing equipmen t necessary for stringing operations. Disturbed areas are restored to their original condition to the maximum extent practicable, or as negotiated with the landowner. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 60 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Unless otherwise agreed upon by the landowner, all storage and construction buildings, including concrete footings and slabs and all construction ma terials and debris will be removed from the site once construction is complete. Post-construction r eclamation activities also include the removing and disposing of debris; dismantling all temporary facilities (including st aging areas); employing appropriate erosion control measures and reseeding areas disturbed by construction activities with vegetation similar to that which was removed. Once construction is completed, landowners are c ontacted by the ROW agent to determine if the clean-up measures have been to their satisfacti on and if any other damage may have occurred. If damage has occurred to crops, fences or the property, the Applicants will compensate the landowner. In some cases, an outside contractor may be hired to restore the damaged property as near as possible to its original condition. 22.5 MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES Access to the ROW of a completed transmission line is required periodically to perform inspections, conduct maintenance and repair damage. Regular maintenance and inspections will be performed during the life of the facility to ensure its contin ued integrity. Generally, the Applicants will inspect the transmission lines at least once per year. Inspections will be limited to the ROW and areas where obstructions or terrain may require off- ROW access. If problems are found during inspection, repairs will be performed and the landowner will be compensated for any loss. The ROW will be managed to remove vegetation th at interferes with the operation and maintenance of the transmission line. Native shrubs that will not interfere with the safe operation of the transmission line will be allowed to reestablish in the ROW. The Applicants' practice provides for the inspection of major transmission lines (230 kV an d above) annually to determine if clearing is required. ROW clearing practices include a comb ination of mechanical and hand clearing, along with herbicide application where allowed to remo ve or control vegetation growth. Noxious weed control with herbicides will be conducted on a two-year cycle around structures and anchors. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 61 J ANUARY 12, 2006 23.0 INFORMATION CONCERNING TRANSMISSION FACILITIES (ARSD 20:10:22:35) 23.1 CONFIGURATION OF TOWERS AND POLES The Applicants are proposing to use H-frame double pole or single pole Davi t arm, wood or steel structures for the 345 kV and 230 kV transmission lines, with the H-frame double pole considered the preferred structure at this time. The final type will be based on final design and an economic analysis. The H-frame poles will have directly embedded foundations where the poles are placed directly in a hole bored 10 to 15 f eet deep and three to four feet in diameter. After the poles are placed, the holes will be backfilled with the native so il or aggregate that is approved for the site. The single poles will require concrete foundations. St ructures erected on concrete will have foundations approximately six to 12 feet in diam eter, and approximately 20 to 40 feet in depth. The structures will have an average height of 100 feet and an average span of 700 to 800 feet. Appendix B contains diagrams of H-frame and sing le pole Davit arm single circuit structures for the 345 kV and 230 kV transmission lines, as well as do uble circuited structures for a portion of the 230 kV transmission line proposed for the Big Stone to Morris or Willmar route. Special structures may be utilized in areas where long spans, corner structures or special issues arise such as wetland or avian issues. 23.2 CONDUCTOR CONFIGURATION The conductor for each phase of the transmission lines has not yet been decided. Each portion of transmission line associated with the project is id entified below with possible conductor size and type. The final selection of the optimal conductors will depend on a number of factors that will be identified during future detailed engineering studies. Morris 230 kV Transmission Line from Big Stone 230 kV Substation to Big Stone 345 kV Substation 2-954 Aluminum Conductor Steel Supported (ACSS) bundled or 2-1272 Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced (ACSR) bundled or 1590 ACSR BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 62 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Morris 230 kV Transmission Line from Big Stone 345 kV Substation to Minnesota/South Dakota border 1272 ACSR (bundled) or 954 ACSS or 1590 ACSR Granite Falls 230 kV Transmission Line from Big Stone 230 kV Substation to Big Stone 345 kV Substation 1590 ACSR or 2-954 ACSS (bundled) or 2-1272 ACSR (bundled) Granite Falls 345 kV Transmission Line from Bi g Stone 345 kV Substation to Minnesota/South Dakota border 2-1272 ACSR (bundled) or 2-954 ACSS (bundled) 23.3 PROPOSED TRANSMISSION SITE AND MAJOR ALTERNATIVES The facility and major alternatives are identified in Sections 8.0 and 9.2 and shown in relation to aerial photos in Appendix A.1 and A.6 and in re lation to land use and zoning in Appendix A.8. 23.4 RELIABILITY AND SAFETY 23.4.1 TRANSMISSION LINE RELIABILITY The Big Stone plant currently has several existing transmission lines that exit the Big Stone 230 kV Substation, and it would appear that there is an opportunity to double circuit some of the existing transmission lines with the proposed transmission li nes from the Big Stone II Transmission Project. NERC defines minimum system performance requirem ents that must be met for different system conditions. They define different types of system events (or situations in which a transmission system facility is inadvertently taken out of service) into four different categories: BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 63 J ANUARY 12, 2006 Category A - All Facilities in Service (No Contingencies) Category B - Event resulting in loss of a single element Category C - Event(s) resulting in the loss of two or more (multiple) elements. Category D - Extreme event resulting in two or more (multiple) elements removed or Cascading out of service For each of the different categories of contingencie s, each reliability region is allowed to expand on the NERC requirements to make them more string ent. Minnesota and South Dakota are in the Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO) reliability region, which is a new reliability region under development between the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and SaskPower. NERC Category C (contingency C5) includes the loss of \"any two circuits of a multiple circuit to werline\" with an exclusion for multiple circuit towers used over short distances in accordance with MAPP Regional exemption criteria. Through the transition of MAPP into the MRO, the current MRO regional exemption criteria for this region is defined in the MAPP Reliability Handbook. In this region if the transmission line is operated at a voltage of 100 kV or higher and the overall distan ce that the transmission line is double circuited is greater than one mile, then it meets the Category C system event. NERC reliability standards require utilities to plan and be able to survive all category C contingencies without system perfor mance violations. In the case of generation outlet facilities near the Big Stone plant, loss of a structure with two of the generation outlet transmission lines would result in severely reduced generation levels fr om BSP II in order to avoid system performance violations. Therefore, separate transmission circuits are n eeded in order to improve transmission system reliability and to obtain the maximum amount of generation from BSP II in the event that an adjacent transmission circuit is out of service. Ther efore, to achieve the most benefit of adding new transmission circuits out of the Big Stone plant for BSP II, new transmission circuits cannot be constructed as double circuit lines. Without the generation available from BSP II, the Applicants might be forced to rely on higher cost generation resources. Double circuit construction has been found acceptable if the power system can reliably withstand simultaneous failure of both circuits on a common structure. Double circuit construction could be appropriate in situations where the two circuits serve different functions, connect different substations, split away and proceed in different directions, or where high capacity (but not redundancy) is required. Since the transmission circuits leaving the Big Stone Plant are for a BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 64 J ANUARY 12, 2006 generation outlet being constructed to have high capacity and redundancy, it is not feasible to construct any of the new transmission circuits on common structures with any of the existing transmission circuits. This is based on analysis of single contingencies involving the loss of one transmission line and two transmission lines that ma y share common structures out of the Big Stone Plant. This analysis indicates that much higher generation levels of BSP II can be maintained if the transmission circuits leaving the Bi g Stone site use separate structures. Building the new transmission circuits on separate structures is vital for providing back-up (redundancy) transmission for outage of adjacent outlet circuits. Therefore, new transmission circuits out of the Big Stone Plant must be c onstructed such that there is minimal chance for \"common-mode\" failures which would simultaneously take two circuits out of service. Common- mode failure means for double-circuit transmission lines include: electrical failure of transmission line insulation due to lightning strike; mechanical failure of one or more structures; broken shield wire falling into power conductors; wind-blown debris causing conductor-conductor short circuits; insulator contamination due to road salt, soot, or agricultural chemicals; wind/sleet/ice conditions contact with aircraft or constru ction equipment (crane, dump truck) protective relaying malfunction (\"sympathetic tripping\" due to fault on adjacent circuit) These common-mode failure mechanisms have all been experienced on the transmission system within the northern MRO transmission system on double circuit transmission lines. 23.4.2 SAFETY Proper safeguards will be implemented for constru ction and operation of the facility. The facility will be designed with the local, state, NESC an d the Applicants' standards regarding clearance to ground, clearance to crossing utilit ies, clearance to buildings, streng th of materials and ROW widths. Construction crews will comply with local, state, NESC and the Applicants' standards regarding installation of facilities and standard construction practices. The Applicants' and industry safety procedures will be followed during and after installation of the transmission line. This will include clear signage during all construction activities. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 65 J ANUARY 12, 2006 The proposed transmission line will be equipped with protective devices to safeguard the public from the transmission line if an accident occurs and a structure or conductor falls to the ground. The protective devices are breakers and relays located where the transmission line connects to the substation. The protective equipment will de-energ ize the transmission line should such an event occur. In addition, the substation will be fenced and access limited to authorized personnel. The costs associated with these measures have not b een tabulated separately from the overall facility costs since these measures are standard practice for the Applicants. 23.4.2.1 Electric Fields Voltage on any wire (conductor) produces an electri c field in the area surrounding the wire. The electric field associated with a hi gh voltage transmission line extends from the energized conductors to other nearby objects such as the ground, towers, vegetation, buildings and vehicles. The electric field from a transmission line gets weaker as one moves away from the transmission line. Nearby trees and building material also greatly reduce th e strength of transmission line electric fields. The intensity of electric fields is associated with the voltage of the transmission line and is measured in kilovolts per meter (kV/M). Transmission line el ectric fields near ground are designated by the difference in voltage between two points (usually one meter). The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line will have a peak magnitude of electric field density of approximately 2.2 kV/M underneath the conducto rs one meter above ground level. The peak magnitude of electric field density for the 230 kV transmission line will be approximately 1.5 kV/M. These predicted levels are significantly less than the maximum limit of eight kV/M that has been a permit condition imposed by the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (EQB) in other transmission line applications. The standard was de signed to prevent serious hazard from static discharges when touching large objects, such as tractors, parked under extra high voltage transmission lines of 500 kV or greater. 23.4.2.2 Magnetic Fields Current passing through any conductor, including a wire, produces a magnetic field in the area around the wire. The magnetic field associated wi th a high voltage transmission line surrounds the conductor and decreases rapidly with increasing di stance from the conductor. The magnetic field is expressed in units of magnetic flux density, expressed as gauss (G). The question of whether exposure to power-line frequency (60 Hertz (Hz)) magnetic fields can cause biological responses or even health effects has been the subject of considerable research for the past three decades. The most recent and exha ustive reviews of the health effects from power- BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 66 J ANUARY 12, 2006 line frequency fields conclude that the evidence of health risk is weak. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) issued it s final report, NIEHS Report on Health Effects from Exposure to Power-Line Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields, on June 15, 1999, following six years of intensive research. NIEHS concluded th at there is little scientific evidence correlating extra low frequency electromagnetic fiel d (EMF) exposures with health risk. While the general consensus is that electric fields pose no risk to humans, the question of whether exposure to magnetic fields potentially can cause biological responses or even health effects continues to be the subject of research and debate. In addressing this issue, the Applicants provide information on EMF to the public, interested customer s and employees to assist them in making an informed decision about EMF. The Applicants will provide measurements for landowners, customers and employees who request them. In addition, the Applicants have followed the \"prudent avoidance\" guidance suggested by most pu blic agencies. This includes using structure designs that minimize magnetic field levels and atte mpting to site facilities in locations with lower residential densities. 23.4.2.3 Stray Voltage Stray voltage is defined as a natural phenomenon that can be found at low levels between two contact points in any animal confinement area wh ere electricity is ground ed. By code, electrical systems, including farm systems and utility distribu tion systems, must be grounded to the earth to ensure continuous safety and reliability. Inevitably, some current flows through the earth at each point where the electrical system is grounded and a small voltage develops. This voltage is called neutral-to-earth voltage (NEV). When a portion of this NEV is me asured between two objects that may be simultaneously contacted by an animal, it is frequently called stray volt age. Stray voltage is not electrocution, ground currents, EMFs or earth currents. It only affects farm animals that are confined in areas of electrical use. It does not affect humans. Stray voltage has been raised as a concern on some dairy farms because it can impact operations and milk production. Problems are usually related to the distribution and service lines directly serving the farm or the wiring on a farm. In those inst ances when transmission lines have been shown to contribute to stray voltage, the electric distribution system directly serving the farm or the wiring on a farm was directly under and parallel to the transmission line. These circumstances are considered in installing transmission lines and can be readily mitigated. The Granite Falls 345 kV transmission line is not proposed to run parallel to any existing distribution line for long distances. Therefore, no stray voltage issues are anticipated with this facility. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 67 J ANUARY 12, 2006 23.5 RIGHT -OF-WAY OR CONDEMNATION REQUIREMENTS The schedule for contacting landowners will be de veloped by Otter Tail and formal option easement negotiations are expected to begin this year. The expansion of the Big Stone 230 kV Substation will not require additional property; however, the Big Stone 345 kV Substation will require additional property. The majority of the landowners are expected to be aware of the facility since the Applicants have already notified landowners potenti ally affected by the facility and held two public meetings in the project area to describe the facility and permitting process. Right-of-way agents will work with the landowners at an early stage to answer questions about the facility and to obtain permission for route surveys and soil investigations prior to construction. As the design of the transmission line is further developed, contacts wi th the owners of affected properties will continue and the negotiation and acquisition phase will begin fo r the Applicants to obtain the necessary land options for the facilities. In the event soil investigation is required to assist with the design of the foundations, the Applicants will inform the landowners at the initial survey consultation that soil borings may occur. An independent geotechnical testing company will take and analyze these boring s. Survey crews also work with local utilities to identify underground utilities along the rou te. This minimizes conflicts or impacts to existing utilities along the route. Where possible, staging and lay down areas will be located within the ROW and limited to previously disturbed or developed areas. Whe n additional property is temporarily required for construction, temporary limited easements (TLE) may be obtained from landowners for the duration of construction. TLEs will be limited to special construction access needs or additional staging or lay down areas required ou tside of the transmission line ROW. During the substation construction phase, any aff ected property owners will be advised as to the construction schedules or needed access to the site. To construct, op erate and maintain the proposed substations, all vegetation will be cleare d from the substation footprint area, from the substation driveway area, and from a buffer area outside the substation fence. Vegetation on the property outside of the substation footprint, driv eway and buffer will be left undisturbed, except where it must be impacted to allow for transmission line access to the substation. The ROW for the Granite Falls 345 kV transmissi on line will be 150 feet wide for any sections of the transmission line that do not follow existing corridors, and approximately 98.5 feet wide for the portions that parallel roadway ROW. The ROW for the 230 kV will be 125 feet wide for any sections of the transmission line that do not follo w existing corridors, and approximately 82.5 feet BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 68 J ANUARY 12, 2006 wide for the portions that parallel roadway ROW. The Applicants preferred structures at this time are single circuit, H-frame, wood or steel poles with an average he ight of approximately 100 feet for most of the route. On average, the transmi ssion line will span 800 feet between structures. Appendix B contains diagrams of H-frame and sing le pole Davit arm single circuit structures for the 345 kV and 230 kV transmission lines, as well as do uble circuited structures for a portion of the 230 kV transmission line proposed for the Big Stone to Morris or Willmar route. 23.6 NECESSARY CLEARING ACTIVITIES The Applicants do not anticipate that the facility w ill require extensive tree clearing. Isolated trees may need to be cleared to allow safe operation of the transmission line. General ROW clearing and maintenance is described in Section 22.0. 23.7 UNDERGROUND TRANSMISSION No portion of the facility will require underground transmission. Transmission lines can be placed underground but at substantial additional expens e compared to overhead construction. For example, placing a 69 kV transmission line underground costs 10 times as much as building overhead. Because of the signific antly greater expense associated with underground transmission construction, the use of underground technology is limited to locations where the impacts of overhead construction are completely unacceptable or where physical circumstances allow for no other option. The Applicants concluded that the environmental and land use setting did not warrant underground construction on any of the proposed transmission lines. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 69 J ANUARY 12, 2006 24.0 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN APPLICATION (ARSD 20:10:22:36) The Applicants believe that this Application contains all the information required to meet the Applicants' burden of proof specified at SDCL 49- 41B-22. No additional information is provided. 24.1 AGENCY COMMENTS Federal and state agencies were contacted by the A pplicants to inform them of the project at the early stages and to request information regardin g potential environmental effects of the project under each agency's jurisdiction.

This review assists the Applicants in identifying potential impacts to cultural and historic resources. Endangered Species Consultation The South Dakota GFP Wildlife Diversity Program maintains and inventory, protects, and manages the species and habitats that comprise the biolog ical diversity of South Dakota. Consultation was requested from the department for the project regarding rare and unique species. Permit to Occupy ROW This permit is required by the So uth Dakota Department of Transportation and is required for the Applicants to gain access to the work site from highway ROW. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 72 J ANUARY 12, 2006 NPDES Permit A NPDES permit is required for stormwater discha rges associated with construction activities disturbing equal to or greater than one acre. A requirement of the permit is to develop and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), which includes BMPs to minimize discharge of pollutants from the site. This permit will be acquired since the construction will cause a disturbance of greater than one acre for the whole of the project. 24.2.3 STATE OF MINNESOTA APPROVALS Certificate of Need Prior to issuance of a route permit, a CON is required from the PUC. Route Permit HVTLs cannot be constructed without a route permit approved by the PUC. Cultural and Historic Resources Review A cultural and historic resources review was condu cted by the Minnesota SHPO. This review assists the Applicants in identifying potential impacts to cultural and historic resources. Endangered Species Consultation The Minnesota DNR Natural Heritage and Nongame Research Program collects, manages, and interprets information about nongame species. Con sultation was requested from the department for the project regarding rare and unique species. License to Cross Public Waters The Minnesota DNR Division of Lands and Minerals regulates utility crossings over, under, or across any State land or public water identified on the Public Waters and Wetlands Maps. A license to cross Public Waters is required under Minn . Stat. \u00a784.415 and Minn. Rules, \u00a76135. The Applicants will file these permits once the desi gn of the transmission line is complete and will acquire the permit prior to construction. Utility Permit A permit from the Mn/DOT is required for constr uction, placement, or ma intenance of utility lines that occur adjacent or across the highway ROW. The Applicants will file for this permit once the design of the transmission line is complete and wi ll acquire the permit prior to construction. BIG STONE TRANSMISSION PROJECT SOUTH DAKOTA PUC ROUTE APPLICATION 73 J ANUARY 12, 2006 NPDES Permit See South Dakota NPDES permit requirements. 24.2.4 FEDERAL APPROVALS Environmental Impact Statement Interconnection of the proposed Transmission Line Project and the associated BSP II Power Plan would incorporate a major new generation resources into Western's transmission system. Western has determined that an EIS is required unde r U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) NEPA Implementing Procedures (10 CFR 1021). The EIS will be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act with Western as the lead Federal agency. Section 106 Review Section 106 of the NHPA requires Federal agencies to \"take into account\" the effects of their actions on \"historic properties\" (i.e., districts, si tes, buildings, structures and objects included in or eligible for the NRHP). Section 106 is implemente d by following regulations issued by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (36 CFR 800). Western is the lead Federal agency for 106 compliance. Agency Section 106 responsibilities can be coordinated with the NEPA process by planning for public participation, analysis and review, such that the purposes and requirements of both statutes are met in a timely and efficient manner. Section 7 Consultation The FWS consults with Federal agencies under S ection 7 of the Endangered Species Act to ensure the Project does not jeopardize listed species or de stroy or adversely modify critical habitat.

Cirriculum Prairie and Grassland Survey Report Prepared for: HDR Engineering, Inc. Big Stone II Transmission Line Corrid ors in Minnesota and South Dakota August 3, 2005 Introduction and Purpose When preparing documents required by t he National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the evaluation of natural re sources within alternative corridors assists utility companies and agencies to identify impacts to wildlife and other biological resource s. Graham Environmenta l Services, Inc. (GES) contracted with HDR Engineer ing, Inc. (HDR) to conduct a review of potential prairie habitats and species listed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern (TES) that lie within the alternative transmission line corridor alignments through Big Stone, Chippewa, Kandi yohi, Stevens, Swift, and Yellow Medicine Counties in Minnesota and Grant and Deuel C ounties, South Dakota ( Figure 1 ). This investigation generally follows the habitat assessment approach outlined by HDR in their Threatened, Endangered, and Rare Species and Communities Survey Approach document submitted to and approved by agency personnel in June 2005 ( Appendix 1). The surveys were conducted on June 21 - 24 and 28, 2005 and involved cursory corridor reviews t hat relied on a preliminary grassland identification survey conducted by HDR, re view of relatively current aerial photographs (2003), and el ectronic data acqui red from existing Department of Natural Resources natur al community surveys available at the Minnesota DNR Data Deli. This report focuses on identifying remnant prairie communities and potential TES habitat within the alternat ive transmission line corridors as identified in Figure 1. The majority of TES species in western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota are likely to occur on remnant prairies, rock outcrops, or in wetlands than on any ot her land classification types that occur in west-central or south-west ern Minnesota, and northeastern South Dakota. HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 2 of 18 Project Area Transmission line corridor alignments were evaluated through portions of western Minnesota and eastern South Dakota Figure 1. The following descriptions are of various corridor alignments that were reviewed. Common Corridor The Common Corridor originates sout hwest of Ortonville, Minnesota and follows the Minnesota/South Dakota border southward for approximately 37 miles through Grant and Deuel C ounties in South Dakota. The Common Corridor then turns east one-mile south of Gary, South Dakota and two-miles south of the Lac Qui Parle/Yellow Medicine County line in Minnesota. This corrridor is genera lly three (3)-miles wide and roughly follows Yellow Medicine County Route 33 for 41 miles. The corridor then turns northward centered on Yellow Medicine County Route 43 to its intersection with Minnesota State R oute 67, then follows Minnesota State Route 67 into Granite Falls and Chi ppewa County, Minnesota. This corridor then terminates at the State Route 23/U.S. Highway 212 intersection. Common Corridor Alternative A The Common Corridor Alternative A is located where the Common Corridor turns eastward and enters Minnesota from South Dakota. This alternative includes an approximate eight (8) square miles east of Gary, South Dakota at the ex treme northwest corner of Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota. Common Corridor Alternative B Common Corridor Alternative B is located northeast of Granite Falls, Minnesota. It encompa sses approximately 12 square miles parallel to the Minnesota River valley in Chippewa County, Minnesota. Alternative Corridor 1 Alternative Corridor 1 and originates in Ortonville, Minnesota. The Alternative 1 corridor is generally a three (3)-mile wide corridor centered on Big Stone County Route 12 to the northeast of Ortonv ille until it reaches County Route 21. Alternat ive Corridor 1 then follows Big Stone County Route 21 for 12 miles until it reaches State Route 28 near Johnson, Minnesota. This alignm ent then turns eastward and follows HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 3 of 18 Minnesota State Route 28 through Stev ens County, Minnesota until it terminates at the Morri s Municipal Airport. Alternative Corridor 2 Alternative Corridor 2 originates at the southeast corner of Ortonville, Minnesota. This alternative corridor is also a three (3)-mile wide corridor which follows U.S. Highway 12 th rough Big Stone County and Swift County until it reaches Kerkhoven, Minnesota where the corridor deviates north of the U.S. Highway 12 corri dor and follows Swift County Route 33 and Kandiyohi County Route 27 two (2) miles into Kandiyohi County. This alternative then terminates at 120 th Street NW in Mamre township and becomes one of two options, either Alte rnative Corridor 2A or Alternative Corridor 2B. Alternative Corridor 2A Alternative Corridor 2A begins at the terminus of Alternative Corridor 2 roughly following Kandi yohi Route 27 for approximately 17 miles until it reaches the term inus at the east edge of Diamond Lake northeast of Kandiyohi, Minnesota. Alternative Corridor 2B This alternative deviates south of Alternative Corridor 2 near the Swift/Kandiyohi County line. Alter native Corridor 2B is a three (3)- mile wide corridor roughly cent ered on the Kandiyohi/Swift and Kandiyohi/Chippewa County lines fo r seven miles after it crosses U.S. Highway 12. Alternativ e Corridor 2B then follows 45th Avenue SW (County Roads 87 and 88) for 15 miles as it skirts the southern limits of Willmar, Minnesota, then turns north until it reaches the southern limit of Alternative Corri dor 2A northwest of Kandiyohi, Minnesota. The survey area lies within the Southw estern Minnesota Grassland (II) regional landscape ecosystem (Albert 1995). The alternative transmission line corridors cross two subsections of this landscape and include; the Upper Minnesota River Country (I I.2), Ivanhoe-Worthington Coteau (II 2.3). Albert (1995) broadly charac terizes the Southwest Minnesota Grassland as once supporting tallgra ss prairie that has been almost completely converted to cropland on soils that are primarily classified as Mollisols Minnesota Soil Survey Staff (1983). The presettlement natural plant communities within this land type association consisted of mesic tallgrass prairie, dry hill prairie, wet gravel prairie. The tallgrass prairie ecosyst em has ceased to exist except in small isolated sites (i.e. on steep slopes, in ditches along road or railroad corridors, and on lands that have escaped plowing) throughout the HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 4 of 18 Midwest. The tallgrass prairie has been converted to agriculturally related land uses and few areas that are dom inated by remnant prairie vegetation remain along the proposed route. The proposed project traverses numer ous natural and planted vegetation community types. The principal natura l community types encountered, in accordance with Minnesota's Native Vegetation: A Key to Natural Communities Version 1.5, include; Mesi c Prairie, Dry subtype, Wet Prairie, and Rock Outcrops. These classifications are based on the dominant plant community assemblages present at a particular location. Lands where native species assemblages persist e ssentially unaltered by plowing or other agricultural practices were further designated as \"remnant\". Remnant communities are distinguis hed from planted native communities by greater ecological function, more complex species assemblages, and a diversity of fauna withi n remnant systems. The following community descriptions refer to remnant communi ty types observed within the survey corridors. Remnant Mesic Prairie Remnant Mesic Prairie is a dry to wet-mesic plant community dominated by grasses and sedges that are locat ed on level to rolling glacial till and glacial lake sediments. Big the dominant species with numerous other species of grasses occurring at different levels of domi nance based upon moisture availability or disturbance ( Figure 2 ). Invasive species such as Kentucky bluegrass pratensis ) and Canada bluegrass ( P. compressa ) occur in varying abundance on these sites depending upon th e level of disturbance at a particular site. Forbs on remnant Mesic Prairie sites are abundant and have a high level of diversity. Forb communities al so vary in diversity and makeup with available soil moisture levels. Soils within Mesic Prairie are generally classified as Molisolls. Remnant Mesic Prairie communities ar e fire-dependent and where fire is absent woody species invade. Many remnant Mesic Prairie areas that host TES species will have an abundance of trees such as green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica ) and eastern red cedar Table 1 lists remnant Mesic Prairie sites identified along the three transmission line corridors.

Set aside lands N Remnant Dry Prairie Remnant Dry Prairie is a dry to dr y-mesic plant community dominated by grasses and sedges. It occurs th roughout the Southwest Minnesota Grassland landscape ecosystem. Genera lly, remnant Dry Prairies have a greater component of Great Plains s pecies than remnant Mesic Prairies (Aaseng et. al. 1993). Mid-height and short grasses and sedges are HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 7 of 18 usually dominant in remnant Dry Pr airie communities (Figure most readily identified species observed on remnant dry prairi e during our review of the survey area. Invasive species such as musk thistle ( ) vary based upon frequency and duration of grazing on these sites. Forb abundance within the remnant Dr y Prairie community type was generally more sparse than on remnant Mesic Prairie community types observed in the survey area. Low shrubs such as leadplant ) were present in varying amounts based upon the level of grazing that occurr ed on remnant Dry Prairie sites. Remnant Dry Prairies are maintained by fire but require less frequent fires than remnant Mesic Prairies due to the droughty conditions where Dry Prairies occur. These dry and poor so il conditions slow the advance of woody species. Soils within the Dry Prairie community type are generally well-drained to excessively dr ained depending upon the degree of slope (Aaseng et. al. 1993). Two remnant Dry Prairie subtypes occurred within the survey area and included; Hill subtype and Sand-Gravel subtype. The Hill subtype occurs on steep terrain and has the greatest species overlap with Mesic Prairies of the Dry Prairie subtypes. Soils are classified as Molisolls but are generally thinner than on Mesic Prairi e sites. The Sand-Gravel subtype occurs on the former shorelines of Glacial Lake Agassiz, on outwash deposits, and on ice-contact kames and eskers. These areas have a higher sand-gravel component than on other Dry Prairie communities. Table 2 lists remnant Dry Prairie sites identified in the survey area.

Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) occurs in varying levels of abundance based upon the amount of historic and current disturbance to the remnant Wet Prairie sites. Remnant Wet Prairies are maintained by fire or mowing and succumb to shrub and tree cover in the absence of these activities. This community type occurs in depressions or drainageways with high water tables throughout a good portion of the growing season.

Set aside lands N Remnant Rock Outcrops Remnant Rock Outcrop plant communiti es occur on areas of exposed bedrock within the Minnesota River Valle y. The bedrock outcrops in the Minnesota River Valley are composed of granite and gneiss (Figure 3). Most plant species present on these out crops grow in shallow dry soil that collects in small depressions on slopi ng rock faces and contain species more typically associated with the flora of the Great Plains including, ball cactus 1993). Small depressions within the rock outcrops often contain wetland species assemblages such as are maintai ned by fire and succumb to shrub and tree cover in the absence of fire.

Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 11 of 18 #43 - Common Corridor This is a large area located adjacent the Minnesota River where land use is dominated by pasture, mining and hay land. Numerous rock outcrops occur throughout this area. Pasture, Fallow lands, Hayed lands N A majority of lands within the surv ey area have been converted to crop production or are set aside lands. Se t aside areas are characterized by a dominance of planted grasses or inva sive non-native grasses with few native forbs. Most grassland communities evaluated within the survey area were dominated by invasive gr asses such as Kentucky bluegrass, Canada bluegrass, ( Lolium perenne ). Most land is planted in crops such as corn, soybeans, sugar beets, oats and other small grains, with pasture land comprising the second largest land us e type throughout the survey area. Towns, gravel mines, granite mines, road and railroad corridors occur to a lesser extent. Numerous Waterfowl Production Areas owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and State owned Waterfowl Management Areas (WMA) and Scientific and Natural Areas also occur within the survey area. Methodologies Transmission line corridors were assessed for sensitive species using information gathered from preliminar y grassland identification surveys conducted by HDR, a review of rela tively current aerial photographs (2003), and electronic data provided from Minnesota County Biological Surveys (MCBS) conducted since1987. GES reviewed potential prairie survey information and aerial photographs of potential remnant sites. Areas deemed most likely to provide suitable habitat for targeted species were identified and then evaluated in the field where accessible. A GES biologist drove along the proposed co rridors stopping at areas that were: identified by HDR as potential prairie; identified as natural communiti es by previous MCBS surveys; exhibited plant communities that are characteristic of remnant native prairies (i.e. an abundance and diversity of native forbs and grasses) ; located in landscape positions that are difficult to plow; pastured, fallow, or set-aside lands. After stopping at publicly-availability access points, GES scanned sites to identify prairie indicator species t hat occurred on the site and noted the ecological condition of the site by assessing historic land use evidence and plant community characteristics. Areas that exhibited an abundance HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 12 of 18 of native forbs, grasses and that were located in landscape positions that were difficult to plow (i.e. abundan t rock outcrops, steep slopes, areas located between roads and railroads) or that were grazed were also scanned for the presence and abundance of native grasses and forbs. Those areas that were planted in nativ e grasses, or that were part of WMA's that were restored to prairie, or set aside lands planted to native grasses, were considered lower quality sites and were documented in ArcGIS \u00ae. Those areas that were dominated by non-native species were designated as grassland and were also documented in ArcGIS\u00ae. On publicly owned properties where a ccess was unimpeded, a cursory meander search was conducted to ev aluate prairie quality and identify sensitive species. Goff et al. (1982) utilized a time meander search to catalogue plants in a variety of pl ant communities and statistically illustrated through species area cu rves that this method adequately samples a given vegetative community for rare plants. A qualitative assessment of the effectiveness of using the transect versus meander- search method conducted by Penska r (1991) in the Ottawa National Forest, Michigan, indicated that the meander-search method is in all probability the best technique to adequately sample for rare taxa in both small and large sample areas. GES modified the meander search me thod by identifying potentially suitable habitats and screening out obv iously unsuitable habitats. This modification allowed us to conduct even more intensive surveys in the areas most likely to harbor target s pecies and eliminate the timed survey intervals described by Goff (1982). Quantitative analysis of the vegetation was not the principal goal of the survey. Areas that were evaluated for prairie characteristics were digitized onto 2003 color aerial photographs and dominant plant community characteristics were documented in the ArcGIS 9.1 \u00ae attribute table. Those parcels that exhibit an abundance and diversity of native forbs and grasses in some portion of the parcel were given an ident ification number. Generally, evaluated parcels were at l east one-acre in size or larger unless GES was able to conduct a m eander search. In those cases where meander searches were conducted, smaller parcels may have been identified. HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 13 of 18 Results Remnant Prairies A total of 297 different sites were ev aluated for characteristics exhibited by remnant prairies and sensitive species along the survey route (Figure 1). The highest quality sites were typicall y previously identified by the MCBS as natural communities or located in road ditches, however, a small number of MCBS sites did exhibit degr aded conditions or were dominated by non-native species. There were a total of 66 prairie systems on 92 sites on all transmission line corridor al ternatives that contained remnant prairie that range in size from isolat ed pockets (< 1 acre) to large (over 40 acres) contiguous areas. Remnant prai ries were found in a variety of stages of succession and ecological health. All of the native plant communities identified along the surv ey routes were affected by the presence of invasive species such as reed canary grass in the wetlands or by smooth brome or bluegrass in the upland communities. Each community type varied in the abundance and location of native species present. All of the sites that were reviewed showed evidence of encroachment by woody species and other invasive or pioneering non- native species. In general, those sites that were managed for prairie species via woody vegetation removal and periodic burning, exhibited a dominance of native grasses and forbs typical of remnant prairies. Transmission line corridors that were k ept free of woody vegetation were another example of when woody veget ation removal benefited prairie communities. This was especially obvious in and around Granite Falls, Minnesota, where transmission line co rridors were kept free of woody vegetation and a healthy diversity of native grasses and forbs were present. Several pastures in rotati on also exhibited an abundance of forbs and native grasses when fallow. Sensitive (TES) Species In addition to evaluating sites for remnant prairies, GES located 49 individual TES species occurrences withi n the transmission line corridors. Locations for 1 species of butterfly, 2 species of birds, and 6 species of plants identified on Minnesota's Li st of Endangered, Threatened, and Special Concern Species were located on public lands or in road ditches along the various corridors. No spec ies identified on the Department of Game, Fish and Parks Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Species of South Dakota list (November 2004) we re identified in the survey area.

Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 14 of 18 Regal Fritillary ( Speyeria idalia ) (Minnesota Special Concern, Federal Category 2 candidate species) The regal fritillary is considered a prairie obligate butterfly that has suffered population declines in the Mi dwest mainly due to the conversion of tallgrass prairies into cropland. Pe sticides have also contributed to the species' decline. Large tracts of nat ive prairie that harbor abundant forbs, prairie remnants, or lightly graz ed pasture lands containing prairie vegetation are habitats utilized by the regal fritillary. Larval includ ing milkweeds, thistle, blazing star, and purple coneflowers. The regal fritilla ry was found at three locations in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota on remnant mesic and dry hill prairie types. Bald Eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus , L.) (Minnesota Special Concern, Federal Threatened) The bald eagle is classified as th reatened under the E ndangered Species Act and breeds in particularly large numbers in northern Minnesota. Typical breeding habitat includes s uper-canopy trees, primarily red pine and white pine, associated with lakes and rivers supporting fish for a food supply (Mathisen 1983) According to the MDNR nongame program web site, the statewide total of breeding pairs is now about 600 and increasing at the rate of 30 pairs per year. Although most nest sites are located in areas with minimal human activity, some eagles have adapted to human presence and nest in close proxim ity to human dwellings and other activity. An adult bald eagle was obs erved within the transmission line corridor at the edge of a wetland in Swift County, Minnesota. Wilson's Phalarope ed with prairie wetlands across the prairie states and provinces of Canada (C offin et. al., 1988). This species is a very local summer resident main ly in the northwestern and central regions of Minnesota (Janssen, 1988) . A Wilson's phalarope was observed on the western shore of Salt Lake in Deuel County, South Dakota and on the Minnesot a side of the lake. Ball Cactus ( Escobaria vivipara , Minnesota Endangered) The ball cactus is a one of three s pecies of cacti that are native to Minnesota and is the rarest of the three species. The only known population is known from granite outc rops near Ortonville in Big Stone County. The ball cactus was identified on numerous granite outcrops within the Big Stone Nati onal Wildlife Refuge in Big Stone County, Minnesota. HDR Engineering, Inc. Remnant Prairie and Grassland Survey Report GES Project No. 2005.082 August 3, 2005 Page 15 of 18 Missouri Milk-Vetch ( Astragalus missouriensis, ) (Minnesota Special Concern) Missouri milk-vetch is a species that occurs on dry plains and river bluffs in the plains states from Alberta to Texas and extends into western Minnesota. Missouri milk-vetch is a many-stemmed perennial with outer stems that may bend toward the ground. Several Missouri milk-vetch plants were observed on dry hill prairie in Chippewa County, Minnesota. Small White-Ladyslipper( Cypripedium candidum, Minnesota Special Concern) In Minnesota, the small white-ladyslipper is a species associated with moist prairies, calcareous fens, a nd sedge meadows (Smith, 1993). It has become rare throughout most of its range. Small white-ladyslippers were found in a road ditch near several MCBS mesic and dry hill prairies in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota. Plains Prickly Pear( Opuntia macrorhiza, Minnesota Special Concern) In Minnesota, the plains prickly pear is found on native prairie, pasture land, often in overgrazed areas, sand bl ow-outs, and on rocky hillsides. It prefers sandy, gravelly or rocky soils. Plains prickly pear was found on scattered remnant rock outcrop prairies in Yellow Medicine and Big Stone Counties, Minnesota. Mudwort ( Limosella aquatica , Minnesota Special Concern) The mudwort is found along stream ban ks, shores, mud fl ats of temporary ponds and marshes, and in the tempor ary pools created by accumulated rain on rock outcrops of western Mi nnesota. This species was found growing next to water hyssop on the granite outcrops within the Big Stone National Wildlife Refuge in Big Stone County, Minnesota. Water Hyssop ( Bacopa rotundifolia , Minnesota Special Concern) Water hyssop is found on mud flats, in shallow water of ponds or marshes and in temporary pools created by a ccumulated mud of rock outcrops. This species was found growing nex t to water hyssop on the granite outcrops within the Big Stone Nati onal Wildlife Refuge in Big Stone County, Minnesota. HDR Engineering, Inc.

The majority of the species of concern inhabit native prai rie and rock outcrops within the proposed corridors. HDR will review the habitat with in the proposed corridors and will initially identify 40 acre blocks (\u00bc \u00bc Section) as habitat. Prairie Defined Unplowed fields of native grassl and or pasture with 10 or more prairie indicator species. The prairie indicator species are found in A ppendix 3 and its supplement in Minnesota's Native Vegetation: A Key to Natural Communities (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Natural Heritage Program, 1993). Survey Approach Step 1: Identify Areas of Potential Prairie Habitat Method Complete a desktop survey of potential locations w ith information from the MCBS, DNR NHIS, the Railroad ROW Na tive Prairie Fragment Survey, and preliminary field notes on th e corridor. We will also consult with the NRCS on CRP lands within the corridor. Consult with agencies to identify additional potential areas of concern. Step 2: Verify Presence of Prairie Habitat Method Prairie will be identified in 40 acre parcels (\u00bc \u00bc Section). Assume access to property: Complete a rapid field assessme nt by walking a transect through potential prairi e areas identified in Step 1. If no property access: Use publicly-available access points and identify prairie plants from the edge of public land adj acent to potential prairie areas identified in Step 1. If the areas identified above have greater than 10 prairie indicator species, then classify as prairie and move to Step 3. Step 3: Identify Avoidance/Minimization Measures Method Once ROW and plan and profiles for the tran smission lines have been established: Surveys for threatened and endangered species will be conducted in probable habitat. Design options will be considered to avoid and minimize impacts to prairie species.

Through Section 404 of the Clean Water ,Act the Corps regulates3he discharge cf drsdgscl or fill material into waters of the United States. Waters of the United States may include, but are not limited to, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, and vernal pools. Based on the information that you provided to this ofice, we . . have made a preliminary determination that Section 33, T157N, R72W; Section 6, T156N1 R72W; and Section 1, TI 56N, R73W appear to contain jurisdictional waters of the United States. Therefore, should the proposed project andlor associated construction activities result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, a Corps permit may be required. If however, the project and associated work can be accomplished by avoiding . . impacts to waters of the United States, a Corps permit would not be required. In order for the Corps to fully review the proposed mitigation project for Section 404 authorization, a completed Corps of Engineers permit application must be submitted to this office. Should construction activities associated with this project result in impacts to waters of the United States, please complete and submit the enclosed permit application to the US. Army Corps of Engineers, North Dakota Regulatory Office, 1523 South 12th Street, Bismarck, North Dakota 58504. It is essential to identify all impacts to waters of the United States resulting from the proposed project. Should you have.any questions regarding this determination, please do not hesitate to contact this office at telephone number (701)-255-0015 or at the letterhead address Regulatory Office . .. @ Printed on Recycled Paper REPLY TO ATENTION OF : DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, OMAHA DISTRICT SOUTH DAKOTA REGULATORY OFFICE 28563 POWERHOUSE ROAD, ROOM 118 PIERRE SD 57501-6174 May 2, 2005 South Dakota Regulatory Office 28563 Powerhouse Road, Room 118 Pierre, South Dakota 57501 HDR Engineering Inc Attn: Michelle Bissonnette 6190 Golden Hills Drive Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416 Dear Ms. Bissonnette: Reference is made to the preliminary information received April 27, 2005, concerning Department of the Army authorization requirements for construction of new 230 kV transmission facilities, in Grant and Deuel Counties, South Dakota. The Corps1 jurisdiction is derived from Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act passed by Congress in 1972. Section 10 calls for Federal regulation of activities in or affecting navigable waters of the United States including adjacent wetlands. Waterways and their adjacent wetlands in South Dakota subject to regulation under the provisions of Section 10 include the Missouri River, the James River, the lower five miles of the Big Sioux River and Lake Traverse (Bois de Sioux River). Section 404 calls for Federal regulation of the discharge of dredged or fill material into certain waterways, lakes and/or wetlands (i . e. waters of the United States) , including the above noted navigable waters. Activities that do not involve work in or affecting navigable waters (Section 10) or activities that do not involve a discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (Section 404) do not require Department of the Army authorization. Based on the preliminary information provided, it can not be determined if the proposed construction activities involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters subject to Federal regulation. Therefore, a Department of the Army permit may be required. For our final determination and for processing of permits, we would ask that the project proponent submit final plans when they become available. Enclosed is the necessary application form (ENG Form 4345) and information pamphlet. When completing the application form, we would request from the applicant (a) a detailed description of the work activity [i.e., explain precisely what you are going to do and how you are going to accomplish it; include fill and/or excavation quantities and dimensions to be performed below the ordinary high water elevation (if in a lake, river or stream) or to be performed within the boundary of jurisdictional wetlands (if the project involves wetlands), along with the source/type of fill and the type of equipment to be used during construction]; (b) the purpose, need and/or benefits of the proposed project; and (c) any alternative project designs or locations considered. Along with the completed application form, we would request from the applicant (1) detailed drawings (plan and cross-sectional views; the drawings should be submitted on 8-1/2x11 inch paper), (2) location map(s) showing all jurisdictional work sites i. e. , where the utility line will be placed in a waterway, lake, and/or wetland) . Any crossing that will exceed 500 feet in length will need to be clearly identified. (3) a delineation of affected wetlands if the project involves wetlands, (4) if available, colored pictures showing at least two views of the proposed project site (s) and (5) any ecological or environmental information available that you feel may be pertinent to your project (i.e., area wildlife activity, area vegetation, area land use, quality of fishery, etc. ) . Adherence to the above information requests will speed up the application evaluation and permit processing time. The requested information is used to help the Corps determine the type of permit to process if a permit is required and is used in the public review. Regarding your request for comment relative to environmental impacts, this office assesses project impacts, including environmental impacts, after receipt of the detailed, site specific information required via our permit application process. However, in general terms, utility line crossings of waters of the United States generally result in minimal impact and are typically permitted under Nationwide Permit No. (12) found in the January 15, 2002, Federal Register, Issuance of Nationwide Permits; Notice (67 FR 2020-2095) and the February 13, 2002, Federal Register, Issuance of Nationwide Permits; Notice Correction (67 FR 6692-6695). Please note that you must notify the Corps of Engineers in the form of a permit application to do work under this Nationwide Permit when one or more of the following criteria apply to the proposed project: a. Mechanized landclearing in a forested wetland. b. The utility line crosses one of the above noted navigable waterways that is sub j ect to regulation under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. c. The utility line in waters of the United States, excluding overhead lines, exceeds 500 feet. d. The utility line is placed within a jurisdictional area (i.e., a water of the United States), and it runs parallel to a streambed that is within that jurisdictional area. e. Discharges associated with the construction of utility line substations that result in the loss of greater than l/l~th acre of water of the United States. f. Permanent access roads constructed above grade in waters of the United States for a distance of more than 500 feet; of g. Permanent access roads constructed in waters of the United States with impervious materials. (Section 10 and 404).

According to National Wetlands Inventory maps (available online at l~ttp://wetlands.fws.gov/), numerous wetlands exist within the proposed construction corridor. If a project may impact wetlands or other important fish and wildlife habitats, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 - 4347) and other environmental laws and rules, recommends complete avoidance of these areas, if possible; then minimization of any adverse impacts; and finally, replacement of any lost acres; in that order. Alternatives should be examined and the least damaging practical alternative selected. If wetland impacts are unavoidable, a mitigation plan addressing the number and types of wetland acres to be impacted and the methods of replacement should be prepared and submitted to the resource agencies for review. Our records indicate that the Service holds easements on some of the properties included in the proposed transmission corridor. For exact locations of these easements and any additional restrictions that may apply regarding these sites within Deuel County, you will need to contact the Service's Madison Wetland Management District at P.O. Box 48, Madison, South Dalcota 57042, Telephone No. (605) 256-2974. For easement issues in Grant County, please contact the Service's Waubay Wetland Management District at 44401 134A Street, Waubay, South Dalcota 57273, Telephone No. (605) 947-4521. The proposed transmission corridor crosses the following waterways that have been classified by the Service as Type 11 High Priority Fisheries Resources: Whetsone River, North Fork Yellow Bank River, Monighan Creelc, West Fork Lac Qui Parle Creelc, and Cobb Creelc. As per a telephone conversation with you on May 11,2005, the proposed transmission lines are to be installed as overhead lines, not buried. In the unlikely event that some of these lines may be buried, we suggest contacting this office again for recommendations regarding minimizing impacts due to stream-crossings. The primary concern of the Service in regard to overhead power lines is the tlueat of electrocution to raptors (hawks, owls, eagles, and falcons). Thousands of these birds, including endangered species, are lulled annually as they attempt to utilize overhead power lines as nesting, llunting, resting, feeding, and sunning sites. The Service recommends the installation of underground, rather than overhead, powerlines whenever possible and appropriate to minimize environmental disturbances. For all new overhead lines or modernization of old overhead lines, we recommend incorporating measures to prevent raptor electrocutions. The publication entitled \"Suggested Practices for Raptor Protection on Power Lines - The State of the Art in 1996\" has many good suggestions, including pole extensions, modified positioning of live phase conductors and ground wires, placement of perch guards and elevated perches, elimination of cross arms, use of wood (not metal) braces, and installation of various insulating covers. You may obtain this publication by contacting the Edison Electric Institute via their website at www.eei.org or by calling 1-800-334-5453. However, please note that the spacing recommendation within the \"Suggested Practices . . .\" publication of at least 60 inches between conductors or features that cause grounding may not be protective of larger raptors such as eagles. This measure was based on the fact that the slin-to- skin contact distance on these birds (i.e., talon to beak, wrist to wrist, etc.) is less than 60 inches. An adult eagle's wingspan (distance between feathertips) may vary fiom 70 to 90 inches depending on the species (golden or bald) and gender of the bird. Unfortunately, wet feathers in contact with conductors and/or grounding connections can result in a lethal electrical surge. Thus, the focus of the above precautionary measures should be to a) provide more than 90 inches of spacing between conductors or grounding features, b) insulate exposed conducting features so that contact will not cause raptor electrocution, andlor c) prevent raptors from perching on the poles in the first place. Additionally, utilizing just one of the \"Suggested Practices . . .\" methods may not entirely remove the threat of electrocution to raptors. In fact, improper use of some methods may increase electrocution mortality. Perch guards, for example, may be only partially effective as some birds may still attempt to perch on structures with misplaced or small-sized guards and suffer electrocution as they approach too close to conducting materials. Among the most dangerous structures to raptors are poles that are located at a crossing of two or more lines, exposed above- ground transformers, or dead end poles. Numerous hot and neutral lines at these sites, combined with inadequate spacing between conductors, increases the tlueat of raptor electrocutions. Perch guards placed on other poles have in some cases served to actually shift birds to these more dangerous sites, increasing the number of mortalities. Tllus, it may be necessary to utilize other methods or combine methods to achieve the best results. The same principles may be applied to substation structures. In addition to electrocution, power lines located adjacent to wetlands or crossing streams may increase the threat of line strike mortality to migratory birds. In situations where these lines are adjacent to large wetlands or where waters exist on opposite sides of the lines, we recommend marking them in order to make them more visible to birds. Orange or yellow aviation balls are frequently used for this purpose. We encourage the use of yellow balls, preferably with a vertical black stripe around the center, as these have been shown to be most effective in preventing line strikes by birds. Most bird strikes occur at mid-span; thus, balls should be placed at least along the central portion of a span. For spans 50 meters or less, place one ball at the center of the span. For more information on bird strikes, please see \"Mitigating Bird Collisions With Power Lines: The State of the Art in 1994\" which may be obtained by contacting the Edison Electric Institute at the same website and telephone number listed above. Additional information regarding simple, effective ways to prevent raptor electrocutions on power lines is available in video form. \"Raptors at Risk\" may be obtained by contacting EDM International, Inc. at 4001 Automation Way, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525-3479, Telephone No. (970) 204-4001, or by visiting their website at http://www.edmlink.com/raptorvideo.htm. Although the size, design, and spacing of devices on transmission lines (as compared to relatively smaller distribution lines) may preclude some of the concerns described above, the Service still recommends that, if burial of the lines is not possible, every effort be made to minimize the electrocution and collision risk posed to migratory birds by these structures. Although the \"Suggested Practices . . .\" publications and \"Raptors at Risk\" video will provide protective recommendations for migratory birds, implementation of these recommendations alone will not remove any liability should violations of the law occur. Please be apprised of the potential application of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), as amended, 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq., and the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (BEPA), as amended, 16 U.S.C. 668 et seq., to your project. The MBTA does not require intent to be proven and does not allow for \"take,\" except as permitted by regulations. Section 703 of the MBTA provides: \"Unless and except as permitted by regulations . . . it shall be unlawfd at any time, by any means, or in any manner, to . . . take, capture, lull, attempt to take, capture, or lull, possess . . . any migratory bird, any part, nest, or eggs of any such bird . . . .\" The BEPA prohibits knowingly takcing, or taking with wanton disregard for the consequences of an activity, any bald or golden eagles or their body parts, nests, or eggs, which includes collection, molestation, disturbance, or lulling activities. In accordance with section 7(c) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 153 1 et seq., we have determined that the following federally listed species may occur in the project area (this list is considered valid for 90 days): S~ecies Status Expected Occurrence Bald eagle Threatened Migration, Winter Resident, (Haliaeetus leucocevhalus) Possible Nesting. Western prairie fringed orchid Threatened Possible Habitat, No Recent (Platanthera praeclara) Specimens. Bald eagles occur throughout South Dakota, and new nests are appearing each year. One lnown nest is located very near Big Stone City in Grant Comty. No construction should occ~v within one-quarter mile of any known active bald eagle nest. The species' nesting season is January to August. Any nests found should be reported to this office. The Western prairie fringed orchid has not recently been documented in South Dakota. However it is recognized that the life cycle of the plant often makes it difficult to detect. Additionally, populations currently exist in the neighboring states of Nebraska, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and potential habitat may still be found in South Dakota. Although the plant is typically associated with intact native prairie, the Western prairie fringed orchid has also been found on disturbed sites. Potential habitats generally include mesic upland prairies, wet prairies, sedge meadows, subirrigated prairies, and swales in sand dune complexes. If these habitats exist within the State Highway 42 corridor, surveys for the Western prairie fringed orchid should be considered prior to construction. If changes are made in the project plans or operating criteria, or if additional information becomes available, the Service should be informed so that the above determinations can be reconsidered. Additionally, the Dakota skipper (Hesperia dacotae) has been located in areas adjacent to the proposed transmission line corridor; thus, it may occur on native prairie areas within the proposed transmission corridor in Grant and Deuel Counties. The Dakota slipper is a candidate species and accordingly is not at present provided Federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. It's candidate status defines this small prairie butterfly as a species in decline that the Service believes needs to be listed as threatened or endangered, but listing is currently precluded by other priorities. Dakota slippers are obligate residents of high quality prairie ranging fiom wet-mesic tallgrass prairie to diy-mesic mixed grass prairie. In northeastern South Dakota, Dakota skippers inhabit dry-mesic hill prairies with abundant purple coneflower but also use mesic to wet-mesic tallgrass prairie habitats characterized by wood lily and smooth carnas. Avoidance of impacts to potential Dakota slipper habitat is recommended. Of all states, populations in South Dakota may be the strongest and most interconnected in the United States. It has been suggested that up to six groups of local populations interconnected by dispersal may occur in South Dakota. The Service appreciates the opportunity to provide comments. If you have any questions on these comments, please contact Natalie Gates of this office at (605) 224-8693, Extension 34.

We agree to participate as a cooperating agency during the EIS scoping phase for this project. However, due to limited staff and resources, we have not reviewed the specific locations you listed, and we will not be available to attend scoping meetings. In the interim, please consider the following general information concerning our regulatory program and about regulation of utility lines. When a proposal involves activity in navigable waters of the United States, such as the Minnesota River, it mzy be subject to the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (Section 10). Section 10 prohibits the construction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under navigable waters of the United States, or any work that would affect the course, location, condition, or capacity of those waters, unless the work has been authorized by a Department of the Army permit. . If the proposal involves deposition of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including discharges associated with mechanical land clearing, it may be subject to the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA Section 404). Waters of the United States include navigable waters, their tributaries, and adjacent wetlands (33 CFR 4 328.3). CWA Section 301(a) prohibits discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, unless the work has been authorized by a Department of the Army permit under Section 404. Information about the Corps permitting process can be obtained online at http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/regulatory. Printed on Recvcled Pa~er e I CEMVP-OP-R (2005-3063-TJH) The Corps evaluation of a Section 10 and/or a Section 404 permit application involves multiple analyses, including (1) evaluating the proposal's impacts in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (33 CFR part 325), (2) determining whether the proposal is contrary to the public interest (33 CFR 5 320.4), and (3) in the case of a Section 404 permit, determining whether the proposal complies with the Section 404(b)(l) Guidelines (Guidelines) (40 CFR part 230). If the proposal requires a Section 404 permit application, the Guidelines specifically require that \"no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences\" (40 CFR 8 230.10(a)). Time and money spent on the proposal prior to applying for a Section 404 permit cannot be factored into the Corps' decision whether there is a less damaging practicable alternative to the proposal. What follows is some general information regarding utility lines and the types of Corps permits that may be required for this project The placement of aerial lines that cross navigable waters of the U.S. requires authorization under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Underground utility lines through waters of the U.S., including wetlands, as well as navigable waters of the U. S. are regulated under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act if there is a discharge of dredged or fill material. Any discharge would require authorization by a general permit or letter of permission. ' Underground lines installed by vibratory plow and directional bore method through waters of the U.S., including wetlands, do not involve a discharge and a permit is not required. However, if installation of connecting points requires excavation and backfill in waters of the US., including wetlands, a permit would be required. The placement of poles, overhead wiring, andlor buried wiring at upland locations is not within the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers, provided the work does not involve the placement of dredged or fill material into any waterbody or wetland. Temporary placement of fill material into any waterbody or wetland for purposes such as bypass roads, temporary stream crossings, cofferdam construction, or storage sites may require a Department of the Army permit. Without detailed construction plans, we cannot provide specific comments regarding the effects that the proposed activity would have on watercourse floodstages. It has been our experience that underground and overhead utility construction has negligible effects on flood stages, provided excess construction material is removed from the floodplain and additional care is taken not to disturb its hydraulic characteristics. i I CEMVP-OP-R (2005-3063-TJH) You may also need city, county, or State permits for the project. You should contact the appropriate agencies for their permit requirements. If the project includes the placement of dredged or fill material in a Federal regulated waterbody, we will notify the responsible State agency for water quality (401) certification. You should also contact the State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) to determine if there are any known historic or archeological sites in the area or if any cultural resource survey would be required. If you have any questions, contact Tom Hingsberger in our St. Paul office at (65 1) 290-5367. In any correspondence or inquiries, please refer to the Regulatory number shown above.

Box 35800 Eillings, Montana 59 1 07 Dear Mr. Stas: Ths is in response to your letter dated June 2,2005, regarding the proposed Big Stone I1 Power Plant and Transmission Project to be located in South Dakota and Minnesota. The interconnection of this line to a Federal transmission system owned and operated by your agency will require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Western Area Power Administration (Western) has requested Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) participation and technical assistance in the environmental review process for this project. We appreciate the early coordination carried out thus far by Western and Otter Tail Power. Meetings held June 14 and 17,2005, helped to inform our understanding of both the project and the processes in a manner that will aid our input and environmental review of the proposed transmission line corridors and routes. Ths letter is in specific response to three requests made in Western's letter. Endangered Species Act coordination and section 7 consultation: The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consult with the Service on proposed actions that may affect federally-listed threatened and endangered species and listed critical habitat. The Service's South Dakota Ecological Services Field Office in Pierre previously submitted a letter that commented on threatened and endangered species that may be present in the action area in South Dakota.

Box 281213 Lakewood, CO 80228-8213 C RE: Scoping Comments on the Proposed Big Stone II Power Plant and Transmission Project in South Dakota and Minnesota Dear MS. Werdel: This letter is in response to the Department of Energy's request for scoping comments regarding the ~nvirohmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Big Stone II Power Plant and Transmission Project. western Area Power Administration (Western) is the power-marketing agency within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and Western will be the lead federal agency for the EIS. The project includes the construction and operation of a 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant near Milbank, South Dakota, at the site of the existing Big Stone Plant (Unit I). The proposed project also includes the upgrade and . construction of new transmission lines in eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota. EPA recognizes the complexity of preparing an EIS on a project of this type and magnitude. We recommend that the EIS rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and, for alternatives which are eliminated &om detailed study, discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated. EPA recommends that an additional alternative be included in the EIS that would evaluate state-of- the-art emission control technologies, and evaluate the use of alternative renewable energy resources. This is particularly important given the type of facility being proposed and the kind of issues anticipated with the construction and operation of this new facility. The new alternative could consider the following topics: Advanced state-of-the-art technologies for both energy efficiency and advanced pollution control systems. An example may include a technology such as the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC). This system produces electricity through a combination of a gas turbine and a steam turbine. IGCC systems are cleaner and more efficient than traditional coal-fired systems. There may be other similar technologies more appropriate but in either case the EIS should disclose a range of power generating technologies and analyze the feasibility of the various technologies for the Big Stone II facility. An assessment of increased carbon dioxide (COz) emissions from the proposed facility, including C02 capture and sequestration. Please estimate the costs of possible future requirements to reduce CO;! emissions, including the cost of retrofitting both Big Stone I and Big Stone 11 for C02 capture and sequestration. Analysis of the C02 emissions is consistent with the President's stated mission to reduce US. greenhouse gas emissions intensity -- the ratio of emissions to economic output by American industry -- by 18 percent over the next 10 years without sacrificing economic growth (Council on Environmental Quality's Climate VISION Web site). Addressing C02 emissions is also consistent with the recent decision from the gth Circuit Court of Appeals on the proposed . DM&E Railroad. (Mid States Coalition for Progress v. Suq5ace Transportation Board, 345 F. 3d 520 (8 Cir. 2003). 0 An assessment of alternative renewable electrical generation to replace or supplement the provision of electricity generated through the use of fossil fuels. As an example, we suggest that the EIS consider the results of the Western report (due in the fall of 2OO5), \"Dakotas Wind Transmission Study,\" which is studying placement of 500 MW of wind energy in North and South Dakota, in determining the viability of auxiliary wind power generation at the Big Stone 11 facility. This should include an analysis of wind farm networking opportunities to ensure consistent transmission delivery. An evaluation of the benefits of investment in \"Demand Management\" to increase energy efficiency in the contracted markets. Big Stone Power Plant 11 cannot meet all of the expected increased demand for electricity by the year 2012, i.e. an increase of 9,300 megawatts. To the extent that additional generating capacity is needed, demand can be partially met by implementing energy conservation programs in the contracted markets. An assessment of the possible environmental benefits of retrofitting Big Stone I with state-of-the- art emission control technologies for mercury recovery, and SOz and NOx emission reductions, for overall emission reductions at the combined Big Stone facility. EPA also recommends that the EIS consider the environmental consequences of the downwind air quality impacts of acid rain and mercury deposition, and potential impacts to wetlands and riparian areas during the construction of new transmission lines. Prior to performing air dispersion modeling for the EIS, we suggest that a modeling protocol be developed and shared with the affected state agencies and EPA. Enclosed are EPA's detailed scoping cormnents. These comments are intended to help ensure a comprehensive assessment of the project's environmental impacts, adequate public disclosure, and an informed decision-making process for alternative selection. We sincerely hope that our scoping cormnents will be beneficial to the project and that they will help streamline the NEPA process. EPA's review and participation in the Big Stone 11 Power Plant and Transmission Line EIS will be coordinated by Robert Edgar (303 3 12-6669) and Jody Ostendorf (303 312-7814) of my staff. Please feel free to contact either them or me at (303) 3 12-6004 regarding these scoping comments.

As you are aware, there are a number of fish and wildlife resources and federally owned lands or easements within each of the respective corridors. Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has been part of a collaborative data collection effort conducted by the project proponent, Otter Tail Power Company, and their consultant, HDR. Some of the information contained in this letter may already be at your disposal; however, any duplication will only emphasize the importance of fish and wildlife resources located throughout the proposed coq-idors. As planning progresses, close coordination between our agencies will be necessary particularly regarding specific routes within the proposed corridors. The following information is intended for incorporation in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Big Stone I1 Transmission Line Project. Threatened and Endangered Species The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalusj, a threatened species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is located within the proposed project corridors. There are documented bald eagle nests that may be affected by the proposed project in both the Ortonville to Spicer, Ortonville to Morris, and South DalcotaMinnesota line to Granite Falls corridors (see enclosed map). It is possible that additional bald eagle nests may exist that have not been recorded, as these specific corridors have not been surveyed for nesting activity. Therefore, it would be prudent to conduct a bald eagle nest survey of any proposed route prior to final design. It will also be necessary to reinitiate consultation for construction activities that do not occur within 0 The western prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera praeclara), listed as threatened, is present near the eastern boundary of the Ortonville to Spicer corridor. This plant is present in wet prairie and sedge meadow habitats. Although no recent populations have been identified in or adjacent to the South Dakota corridor, suitable habitat for this species exits within the corridor. 26 but the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) would not support this as a stand-alone provided by Otter Tail Power which grants permission to site poles at certain locations but does not define a specific corridor width and location. The document is inconclusive regarding the potential need for additional ROW with the proposed project. If additional ROW is required, it would likely entail a fee-title land exchange because other alternatives in this important bird area are limited. The federal land-use compatibility law pertinent to this discussion may allow minor expansion and alteration of existing ROW on refuge lands but the proposed scope of this project makes it unlikely that it could be determined a \"minor expansion or alterationy7. There is a very large drained wetland in T122N R45 W Sections 9, 10, 1 1, 14, and 15 (most of it in Section 10). The Service has an interest in restoring this wetland. The transmission line should go around this drained basin or at least be constructed with the understanding that the wetland may be restored. This would affect pole location and pole construction. It would be best to avoid the basin entirely or at least merely span a fringe of the wetland with construction appropriate for a future flooded condition. As,detailed in the maps and GIs shapefiles provided to HDR and WAPA, there are a lacge number of WPAs and wetland or grassland easements to avoid, particularly in the noithern corridor alternatives. There are a number of Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) owned and managed by the state of Minnesota located within corridor; if these lands were purchased with Federal Aid funds, approval for a change in land use would need to be sought by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources OW\\TDNR) and agreed to by our Federal Aid division prior to construction. Big Stone I1 south to Gary, South Dakota: It will be difficult to avoid Service lands in this corridor. Locating the route to the east in the Madison or Dawson area may be one option to avoid Service lands in South Dakota. \" \"Approxim%tely three miles south of U.S. Highway 212, it becomes very difficult to avoid wetland and grassland easements managed by the Service. A complete map of these resources was provided to HDR in prior discussions. South DakotaMnnesota line east to Granite Falls: There are a number of new Northern Tallgrass Prairie NWR easements in the Canby area. Some in the planning corridor include easements in T115N R46W Sections 2,3, 10, 12, 13, 14, that must be avoided. Many more new easements are anticipated for this area. It is best to coordinate directly with the Morris WMD for the most up-to-date information. There are also several Farmer Home Administration (FmHA) easements close to the state Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) near Granite Falls that must be avoided. In addition to our concerns regarding impacts to public lands, there is an important migratory bird area near the Salt Lake area on the South Dakota/Minnesota border that should be avoided.

Aquifer Protection Overlay District Section 1105.01 Purpose and Intent: The Deuel County Zoning Commission recognizes (1) that residents of Deuel County rely exclusively on ground water for a safe drinking water supply and (2) that certain land uses in Deuel County can contaminate ground water particularly in shallow/surficial aquifers. The purpose of the Aquifer Protection Overlay District is to protect public health and safety by minimizing contamination of the shallow/surficial aquifers of Deuel County. It is the intent to accomplish this, as much as possible, by public education and securing public cooperation. Appropriate land use regulations will be imposed, however, which are in addition to those imposed in the underlying zoning districts or in other county regulations. It is not the intent to grandfather in existing land uses which pose a serious threat to public health through potential contamination of public water supply wellhead areas. Section 1105.02 Definitions for Aquifer Protection Overlay District: 1. Abandoned Well: A well no longer used or intended to be used as a water source. 2. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation: (See Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, Article XIII.) 3. Best Management Practices: Measures contained in Soil Conservation Service South Dakota Technical Guide, either managerial or structural, that are determined to be the most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing pollution inputs from non-point sources to water bodies. 4. Chemigation: The process of applying agricultural chemicals (fertilizer or pesticides) through an irrigation system by injecting the chemicals into the water. 5. Class V Injection Well: A conduit through which potentially contaminated but generally non-hazardous fluids can move below land surface to the subsurface. The types of primary concern in Deuel County are (1) commercial/industrial facility septic tanks used to dispose of more than domestic wastewater, and (2) dry wells for repair/service bay drains at facilities servicing motorized vehicles/equipment. 6. Contamination: The process of making impure, unclean, inferior or unfit for use by introduction of undesirable elements. 7. Contingency Plans: Detailed plans for control, containment, recovery and clean up of hazardous materials released during floods, fires, equipment failures, leaks and spills. F.2 Page xvii 8. Development: The carrying out of any surface or structure construction, reconstruction or alteration of land use or intensity of use. 9. Facility: Something built, installed or established for a particular purpose. 10. Grey Water: All domestic wastewater except toilet discharge water. 11. Hazardous Materials: A material which is defined in one or more of the following categories: a. Ignitable: A gas, liquid or solid which may cause fires through friction, absorption of moisture, or which has low flash points. Examples: white phosphorous and gasoline. b. Carcinogenic: A gas, liquid or solid which is normally considered to be cancer causing or mutagenic. Examples: PCBs in some waste oils. c. Explosive: A reactive gas, liquid or solid which will vigorously and energetically react uncontrollably if exposed to heat, shock, pressure or combinations thereof. Examples: dynamite, organic peroxides and ammonium nitrate. d. Highly Toxic: A gas, liquid or solid so dangerous to man as to afford an unusual hazard to life. Examples: parathion and chlorine gas. e. Moderately Toxic: A gas, liquid or solid which through repeated exposure or in a single large dose can be hazardous to man. Example: atrazine. f. Corrosive: Any material, whether acid or alkaline, which will cause severe damage to human tissue, or in case of leakage might damage or destroy other containers of hazardous materials and cause the release of their contents. Examples: battery acid and phosphoric acid. 12. Manure Storage Area: An area for the containment of animal manure in excess of 8,000 pounds or 1,000 gallons. 13. Leaks and Spills: Any unplanned or improper discharge of a potential contaminant including any discharge of a hazardous material. 14. Pasture: A field that provides continuous forage to animals and where the concentration of animals is such that a vegetative cover is maintained during the growing season. 15. Primary Containment Facility: A tank, pit, container, pipe or vessel of first containment of a liquid or chemical. F.2 Page xviii 16. Secondary Containment Facility: A second tank, catchment pit, pipe or vessel that limits and contains a liquid or chemical leaking or leaching from a primary containment area; monitoring and recovery systems are required. 17. Shallow Aquifer: An aquifer vulnerable to contamination because the permeable material making up the aquifer (1) extends to the land surface so percolation water can easily transport contaminants from land surface to the aquifer, or (b) extends to near the land surface and lacks a sufficiently thick layer of impermeable material on the land or near the land surface to limit percolation water from transporting contaminants from the land surface to the aquifer. 18. Ten Year Time of Travel Distance: The distance that ground water will travel in ten years. This distance is a function of aquifer permeability and water table slope. 19. Zone of Contribution: The entire area around a well or wellfield that contributes water to the well or wellfield. Section 1105.03 Delineation and Regulation of Aquifer Protection Overlay Zones Boundaries for the aquifer protection zones for the Aquifer Protection Overlay District are shown on maps prepared by the East Dakota Water Development District (EDWDD), Brookings, South Dakota and by the South Dakota Geologic Survey, Vermillion, South Dakota. Said maps are hereby adopted by reference as part of these regulations as if the maps were fully described herein. The Aquifer Protection Overlay District is divided into two zones. The zone of contribution for Zone A, was mapped by the (EDWDD) with South Dakota Geological Survey (SDGS) technical assistance using techniques outlined in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publication \"Guidelines for Delineation of Wellhead Protection Areas\", June, 1987. The shallow/surficial aquifer boundary for Zone B was mapped by the SDGS as Task 3 of EDWDD's comprehensive ground water project. Section 1105.04 Zone A -- Aquifer Critical Impact Zones Zone A, the wellhead protection area, is the mapped zone of contribution around all public water supply wells or wellfields in shallow/surficial aquifers and includes land upgradient from the well or wellfield to the ten year time of travel boundary.

Storage of liquid fertilizer, pesticides and/or herbicides without an approved permanent secondary storage system. Section 1105.08 Zone B -- Aquifer Secondary Impact Zones Zone B is the remainder of the mapped shallow/surficial aquifer in the County not included in Zone A. Zone B is being protected because (1) the aquifer is a valuable natural resource for future development, (2) the aquifer provides drinking water supply for individual domestic users, (3) contamination is not justified just because this area is not currently used for public water supply and (4) contaminants from this area could eventually enter Zone A. Section 1105.09 Permitted Uses in Zone B: 1. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts provided that they can meet the Performance Standards as outlined for the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zones. F.2 Page xxi Section 1105.10 Special exceptions in Zone B: 1. All special exceptions allowed in underlying districts, with the exception of those expressly prohibited in Zone B, may be approved by the Board of Adjustment provided they can meet Performance Standards outlined for the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone. 2. All new and expansion of existing concentrated animal feeding operations may be required to conduct shall require soil borings to determine impermeable material between land surface and the aquifer. 3. Earthen storage basins and lagoons may be approved by the Board of Adjustment after site-specific review. Earthen storage basins and lagoons shall require soil borings to determine impermeable material between land surface and the aquifer. The Board reserves the right to require an impermeable liner to prevent ground water contamination. Section 1105.11 Prohibited Uses in Zone B: The following uses are expressly prohibited in Zone B: a. Fall application of nitrogen fertilizer except spreading of manure b. Land spreading of petroleum contaminated soil; c. Land spreading or dumping of waste oil; d. Class V injection wells; Section 1105.12 Performance Standards For Aquifer Protection Overlay Zones: The following standards shall apply to land uses in Zones A and B of the Aquifer Protection Overlay Districts: 1. New or replacement septic tanks and associated drain fields for containment of human wastes must conform with regulations established by the State Department of Environment and Natural Resources. 2. (Reserved) 3. Storage of petroleum products in quantities exceeding (100) gallons at one locality in one tank or series of tanks must be in elevated tanks; such tanks larger than one thousand (1,000) gallons must have secondary containment system where it is deemed necessary by the County Zoning Office. F.2 Page xxii 4. Any commercial or industrial facility, not addressed by (2) or (3) above, involving collection, handling, manufacture, use, storage, transfer or disposal of any solid or liquid material or waste, except for spreading of manure, in excess of one thousand (1,000) pounds and/or one hundred (100) gallons which has the potential to contaminate ground water must have a secondary containment system which is easily inspected and whose purpose is to intercept any leak or discharge from the primary containment vessel or structure. Underground tanks or buried pipes carrying such materials must have double walls and inspectable sumps. 5. When pastured animals are concentrated for winter feeding and the number of animal units exceeds two hundred (200), measures shall be employed to prevent runoff of manure 6. Owners/operators of active or abandoned feedlots shall handle and dispose of manure in accordance with Soil Conservation Service South Dakota engineering Standard, Nutrient Management System (680) 7.
