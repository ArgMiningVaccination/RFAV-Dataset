Though some hailed the quick development of the mRNA vaccines as a scientific breakthrough, the development of mRNA vaccines actually started decades ago. Using mRNA as a therapeutic tool was first proposed in the early 1990s and became feasible in the early 2000s. The first clinical trial of an mRNA vaccine was conducted in 2008 to treat prostate cancer. That vaccine was developed to stimulate the patient's immune system to attack prostate cancer cells. The results of that trial were promising and paved the way for further research in mRNA vaccines. In 2013, the first mRNA vaccine was approved for use in humans. [Provenge](https://provenge.com/) was designed to treat prostate cancer by using the patient's immune cells to attack cancer cells. This vaccine demonstrated the potential of mRNA technology to improve the immune system. The development of mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases began in the early 2010s. In 2013, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the National Institutes of Health developed an mRNA vaccine for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus. That vaccine successfully treated the virus in animals and opened the doors to new advancements towards strengthening immunity. However, the breakthrough moment for mRNA vaccines came in late 2019 with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two of these vaccines \u2014 from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna \u2014 were approved for emergency use in the USA in December 2020. Today, millions of people worldwide have received mRNA vaccines as these have proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19 infections and reducing the severity of the disease. Who invented the mRNA vaccine? The development of mRNA vaccines is the result of decades of research that began at the University of Wisconsin in the 1990s. The recent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, were an outgrowth of that research and were developed by two teams of researchers who were able to develop those vaccines and see them approved for use within a specific period of time. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was developed by a team of researchers led by Dr. Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech and Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, chief medical officer of the company. The two co-founded BioNTech in 2008 to use mRNA technology for cancer therapies. Their [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9201022/) on cancer immunotherapy led to the discovery that mRNA could produce a specific protein that could stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. That discovery facilitated the development of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, the Moderna vaccine was developed by a team of researchers led by Dr. Derrick Rossi and Dr. Noubar Afeyan, co-founders of Moderna. Dr Rossi was studying how to reprogram human cells to act like embryonic stem cells. That research led to the development of Moderna's mRNA technology platform that allowed the company to quickly develop a COVID-19. Early research Researchers at the University of Wisconsin in the 1990s introduced the idea of using mRNA as a vaccination tool. The initial stage of the [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-021-00283-5) focused on using mRNA to stimulate the immune system to respond against cancer cells. Researchers began exploring the use of mRNA for infectious diseases, such as influenza and Zika virus, in the early 2000s. An important milestone in the research involves the development of a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform in 2012 by researchers at Imperial College London. After that, in 2013, Moderna began a Phase 1 clinical trial for a personalized cancer vaccine that used mRNA technology. Development of mRNA vaccine The [development of mRNA vaccines](https://www.avantorsciences.com/pages/en/mrna-vaccines-therapies) involves using a small piece of the virus's genetic material (mRNA) to trigger an immune response. The mRNA is enclosed in lipid nanoparticles. These nanoparticles protect the mRNA and let it enter the cells. After it enters the cells, the mRNA instructs the cells to produce a protein found on the virus's surface. This protein triggers an immune response, allowing the body to recognize and combat the virus. Acceleration [mRNA vaccine](/cms/bioprocessing_vaccines) technology allows quicker development of specific vaccines than traditional development methods. That, coupled with the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic created a situation in which the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and equivalent organizations in other countries, allowed for quicker clinical trials and a quicker evaluation of the vaccine's safety and efficacy. The collaboration between biopharmaceutical companies, governments and research institutions [accelerated mRNA vaccine development](https://www.avantorsciences.com/pages/en/thought-leadership-advancing-mrna-vaccine-production-management). The US government's Operation Warp Speed initiative funded and supported vaccine developers. The unprecedented global demand for a vaccine also led to a rapid increase in manufacturing capacity, allowing for the mass production and distribution of mRNA vaccines. What was the first mRNA vaccine? Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was the first mRNA vaccine to receive emergency use authorization from the FDA when it was approved for use in people 16 years and older in December 2020. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was developed to prevent COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is a two-dose vaccine administered three weeks apart. The vaccine contains a small piece of mRNA that encodes the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The process begins when the mRNA in the vaccine instructs human cells to produce the spike protein that trigger an immune response. This response helps the body recognize and fight the virus if it is encountered in the future. Pfizer developed the [BioNTech COVID-19](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against) vaccine with the German biotechnology company BioNTech. The vaccine was based on technology under development for several years but had not yet been approved for human use. The authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was a landmark moment in the history of mRNA vaccines. Since then, other mRNA vaccines have been authorized for use against COVID-19, such as the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The success of these vaccines has increased interest in developing mRNA vaccines for other infectious diseases and cancers because mRNA vaccines can be effective against many viruses, including the COVID-19 virus. To fully understand their importance, mRNA vaccines should be compared to traditional vaccines. mRNA vs. traditional vaccines mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines work differently from traditional vaccines that use weakened or inactivated forms of the virus or bacteria to stimulate an immune response. In contrast, mRNA vaccines use a small piece of genetic material from the virus to instruct cells in the body to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of mRNA vaccines: Advantages Efficacy mRNA vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy rates in clinical trials. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines show over [90%](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against#:~:text=The%20case%20split%20between%20vaccinated,of%20a%202%2Ddose%20schedule.) effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. This high efficacy results from mRNA vaccines stimulating both antibody and T-cell responses. Speed of Development One of the major advantages of mRNA vaccines is development speed. Vaccines can be produced quickly using a computer and a DNA synthesizer that are based on genetic material. That means mRNA vaccines can be produced in weeks instead of months or years, which is particularly important in the event of a contagious pandemic. Safety Because mRNA vaccines do not contain any virus, they can be safer than traditional vaccines that use weakened or inactive viruses to treat the patients. Additionally, mRNA vaccines may have fewer side effects as they do not contain adjuvants. Disadvantages Storage requirements One major disadvantage of mRNA vaccines is their storage requirements. They may require ultra-cold storage, such as storage at -70\u00b0C. That requirement can make the distribution and storage of mRNA vaccines more difficult and expensive. Limited availability Producing nRNA vaccines is a complex process that can take time to fully implement. That means there could initially be limited supplies that can not meet demand during emergencies, such as a global pandemic. Long-term safety Because mRNA vaccines are a relatively new technology, there is limited data on their long-term safety. However, early data from clinical trials and real-world use suggest that these vaccines are safe, with only mild to moderate side effects reported. The future of mRNA vaccines The success of these mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of the technology to revolutionize the field of vaccines and combat various diseases. The future of mRNA vaccines looks promising as researchers explore their use in several areas, including infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. One of the advantages of mRNA vaccines is their ability to be quickly developed and produced, which is crucial in the case of emerging infectious diseases or pandemic situations. Infectious diseases mRNA vaccines can effectively protect against viral diseases, such as COVID-19. Research is ongoing to develop mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases including Zika, HIV, influenza and Ebola. The development of such vaccines can be accelerated due to the mRNA technology's ability to produce vaccines more quickly than traditional vaccine production methods. Cancer [mRNA](/store/product/40758094/vwr-exocleanup-fast) vaccines are being investigated for their potential to treat and prevent cancer. These vaccines can trigger an immune response against cancer cells by encoding a protein found in cancer cells, prompting the immune system to target and destroy them. Genetic disorders mRNA technology can deliver functional copies of missing or defective genes, potentially treating genetic disorders. This approach is being investigated in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. However, some challenges still need to be addressed in developing and deploying mRNA vaccines, such as ensuring their stability during storage and transportation, addressing potential side effects and overcoming hesitancy among some individuals to receive mRNA vaccines. In summary, [mRNA vaccines](/store/product/40131261/innovative-alternative-to-lnps-for-mrna-therapeutics-i-in-vivo-i-jetrna-polyplus-transfection) have the potential to transform the field of vaccination and offer a promising avenue for the prevention and treatment of various diseases.

Frequently asked questions The first mRNA vaccine authorized for emergency use in humans was developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and was authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 11, 2020, to prevent COVID-19. The discovery of mRNA (messenger RNA) has been attributed to several scientists, including Elliot Volkin, Lazarus Astrachan and Severo Ochoa, who first described its structure and function in 1955. Traditional vaccines contain a weakened or inactivated form of a virus. In contrast, mRNA vaccines use a small piece of the virus's genetic material (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce a harmless piece of the virus, which then triggers an immune response in the body. mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus and do not alter a person's DNA. Additionally, mRNA vaccines can be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines, which has made them a valuable tool in the fight against COVID-19. "}
