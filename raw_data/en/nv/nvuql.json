(cited in Toth, Delaney & Lupton, 19~1, p. 105) The menstrual taboo is universal: many tribal cultures, from aIl corners of the world, consider the dangers of Ji contact and contagion so ~reat that women are secluded in separate huts during their monthly flow. In less 1 restrictive cultures menstruating women mJ\u00c7 still be forbidden to cook the family's meals or touch men's utensils / and tools for fear 'of illness or bad luck. They are often .. prevented from working in the fields ~est they harm crops ; 1 (Hays, 1972). , ; 1 1 1 .. o\u00b7 The ~rigins of many modern d\u00e9y attitudes and bel~efis can be traced -to pr imi t i ve mens trua 1 taboos-. 'roth et al. 1 - (1981) state that the origins of the superstition ~hat one shQuldn 1 t w\u00ea;ll k under a ladder, \"come_s f rom a pr im i ti ve ' , belief that one should not pass under bridges, clotheslines, trees, or tne like if a menstruating woman is around,. lest some o'f the blood faii on on~'s uns~specting curse\" the be1ief that the menstruai flow was infli\u00e7ted\"on women by God as a punishment for her sin in the Garden'of Eden (Weideger', 1976). ~ Although the p~im~tive origins of such attitudes are ~ . rare1y cORscioJs1y acknowl~dged in our culture today, thelr .' remnants can be detected within the guise of religious tradition and aesthetic values. The mens~~ual taboo remains . , di as lepsy, 'dr'unkenness and. i nsan i t}' will pe the fate of children conceived during menstruation. Orthodox Judaism prohibits sexual activity during and ~or seven days foilowing menstr~ation, and Jewish women are not . ' / allowed to pray i~ the temple during their menstruation. , . Christian sects whiQh adher~ to a literaI interpretation of .the Bible are governed by similar restrictions, as outlined in the book of Leviticus: 1 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her f1esh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days and whosoever toucheth her shall be , . 2 J ( unclean until the even. . .. ~But even if she be cleansed of her issue, then ., -she shall nurnber to herself seyen Leviticus XV~19~24~28 Alt~ough both the women's movement and the sexual ~ liberation of th\u00e8 last~seveEal decades has served to debunk Many o~ the rnyths associated with female sexuality -(including menstruation) a r~cent survey cited reason ..

Hippocrates\" Oiseases of Women ~ttributed hysterical sui~idal thoughts to \"the , agitated b100d seeking a channel of escape fr6m the womb\" ~ (cited in Simon, or 4 days of ea~h menst.ruation; the 'rernainder of the month was characterize~ .\" by normal functioning (cited in stone, 1982).

Evidence of ingra~ned the reduced capac i t ioes of wQmep menstruall y and premenstrua Il y rema i ns prevalent today. The most_spectacular example in recent . . times involves the use of premenstrual syndrome as a legal \u00ea defence. Two well-publicized trials in England employed pleas of diminished res~pnsi~ility due tO.premenstrual syndr0l1!e as a successf~l defence ~women i nvol ved were put on probation and ordered to report to Dr. K. 'Dalton for progesterone treatment in lieu of jail terms. These' ~. 1 decisions have stirred considerable contro~ersy. ~? \\ adJ;tion to the objectio~ of feminist groups that such a .J. defencl wilL foster pejorative attitudes towards women, there is the very concrete issue that premenstrual syndrome lacks a firm foundation of scientific evidence character i z i ng . i t a.sl a med i ca l di sorder Furthermore, there ~ ~is no scientific eviqence for the \"efficacy of progesterone treatment in relieving the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. \\.. A recent decision by the American Psychiatrie\u00b7 ~ssociatlon to include \"perilu'teal Phase upcoming revijion of the Dia,gnostic and Statis,~ical Manual of Mental Disorders has stimulated controversy ap well (Holden, 1986). The most common obje\u00e9tion to . characterizing premenstrual psychological changes as a' l . mental disorder is that it seems precipitant ttven our current statej k~Wledge: The et.iology has not been establi~hed, onsi~tent constellation of symptoms has leen objectively defined, and no reliable'response t~ ~ , r ~) . treatment has been demonstrated. not The wi despr~ad' and perhaps premature recogni tion of ~ . '.. 'premenstrual syndrome by legal and-medical- communiti\u00e8s has lent urgency to the need for an increased understanding of this phenomeoon. Mood changes which occur premenstrually , have recently b~en cited as holding a key to a greater un~erstanding of psychia~ric illnes~ ~-particularly affective illness. rates for_premenstrual mood change and current or past affective illness, (b) cl i ni cal ch psychiatrie admissions during the , . premenstrOum and menstruum, and (d) the assQciation b\u00e8tween \\ disorders of mood and periods of endocrine change (i.e. menarche, menstru\u00e0tion., -pregnancy, menopause, oral contraceptive use).; The fairly consistent finding, in.epidemiological 5 -\\ , ! - ,/ p \" 1 surveys and ~osp~tal treatment statistics, of twice the , inciden~e of d\u00e8pressiorY' in wornen cornpared to men h'as led to speculation concerning the ro~e of gonadal hormones in ,,\\ depression.

Rogers (1982), fjr ~x~mple, has \\ receptly proposed that neurotransmitter functioning and\\. estrog~n levels in females int~ract to cause depression. ~ 1 . The purpose of-this thesis is to investigate the phe~omenon of ~~menstrual dysphoric mood ,change from a theoretical perspective derived from depression research. I~ the proces~, the construct\"validity of premenstrual depression specifically, and premenstrual syndrome' generally, will be assessed. Mood changes occur~ing premenstrually have generally b~en considered as part of a broader \"premenstrual syndrome~. The subsequent historical review will refer to d\" premenstrual syndrome unless otherwise stated. ~- Definition Although the definition of premenstrual syndrome has evolv~d over the years, the evolution has by no means been 6 c ( \\ in the direction of increased clarity. To the contrary, the delineation of the syndrome has grown mor~ complex, even ~ convoluted, but this may simply r\u00e8flect the Inherent complexity of_~he phenom~non. The progression in'definlt10n will be reviewed~th a focus on the symptomatology involved and its temporal occurence .. o a Premenstrual ten,s i on, undr'ome was fi rst character ized as a medlcal disorder by Frapk in 1931. He described a constellation of symptoms --both physical and emotional ~hich began from 7 to 10 days preceding menstruation and -' continued until the,menstrual flow began. The most and ill considered actions\" -:. -(Frankf 1931, p.1054). In one case, tension was accompani-ed by edema and a marked decrease in urinary secretion. FranK also noted cases in which the recurrence of epilepsy and Cl bronchial asthma were confined to the premenstrua1 phase. these sYIIlptoms t,o an exess circu1ating cases QY irradiatIon of\" - ~he ovaries,'resulting ln temporary or permanent amenorrhea (and hence sterllits). Israel (1938) reported that premenstrual tension could occur as many as 14 days prior to the onset of menses, and , give rise to marked changes, in personality. He estimated that while up to 40% of normal women suffer minor sympt~ms of fatigue, irritability and physical discomfort 7 .. , a , \\ '0 1 .,,-, premenstrually~ the symptoms are \"s.ufficiently . intense and dellneated to deserve recognition as a morbid \"\" J entity\" (p.172l). Israel also depicted feelings of ~ension, J irritability and restlessness as central to the dlsorder, and nQted that crying spells, insomnia, breast swelling and pain, headache and vertigo were frequently accompanying - '. symptoms. He observed that p~emenstrual tens\\ion could mimic . , oncoming mental disease when, for example, extreme agitation -was followed py brief periods of depression. #-\\ \" ,Green and Dalton (1953) coined the term \"premenstrual 1 - '\" /', syndrome\" (PMS) ,to reflect theitt view that tensIon represented only one of ~h~ many possible ~~oms occuring . premenstrually. They also believed that by emphasizing the -psychological dimension (tension) a psychological etiology wa~ implied, whereas Dalton represents on~ of the strongest proponents\\ of a pur~ly physiological basis .for the syn'drome. In reviewing the literature of the day, Green and Dalton -gleaned reports of ~ bro?d range of symptoms which either appeared or showed e~acerbatIon~ premenstrually, Including: headache, edema, welght gain, breast tenderness, abdominal bloating and pain, epileptIform seizures, asthmatic attacks, ~ fever, lumbar p~ln, psychosexual disorders, emotional \" instability, depression, irritability, increased appetite, nausea and vomiting, vertIgo, as ~ell as crimes of violence. They also noted that such symptoms could occur at ovulatIon \" or in the first few days of menstruation. Daiton (1964) la ter introduced the term \"paramenstruum\" ff 8 .. / . ( \\ to refer to th& four days prior to menses plus the first four days of men~es, t~e period during which she considered symptoms to be at their peak; Many of her survey studies have employed this time periode Dalton currently (t977) recognizes severar other temporal patterns of ptemenstrual 'change: (a) symptoms accu r dur i-ng the la te premens truum, (bl symptoms occur a t oV'\\llat i on fo'r a day or two and reappea r . during the premenstruum (7 days prior to menses), and (c) symptoms appear at ovulation and graduall'y increase in G severity throughout the luteal phase. W~thin each pattern, symptoms May end abruptly with the onset of menstruation, or a day earlier, o'r continue into' the first few days of flow. '1 , By the la te 1960' s more than 150 di fferen~ s ymptoms had 4- been identlfied as fluctuating with the menstru~l cycle 1 (Moos, 1969), from every conceivable field (e.g. '1 derrnatological, neurologicai, a~tonomic, psychosexual, ,behavioral, cognitive, affective). Dalton (1977) noted that, \"the prem\u00e8nstrual syndrome is probably the only disease which, for d1agnosis, does not depend upon the type , of symptoms. It is the time relationship 'of sympt~ms to , menstruation that provides the di~gnosis\" fact, \u00e8mploy seve~al other di\u00e2gqottic ~riteria, including consistenc~ of symptoms (must occur in eacn of the las t three, cycles) as weIl as an i nfer red j u\u00e0g.ement of \\ sever:i ty (bad enough \u00b7to, seek medi cal adv-\u00ef ce or de\"mand \" ana.lg\u00e8s i cs > certain{y represents the broadest \\ .. -' .. 9 .~ J J a \" \\ , . -/ definitional criteria for PMS. It is questi~nable, however, whether such an arno rphous and var iab1e cons t r uct' can h ;. properly be considered a \"syndrome\". Brooks-Gu'nn (1986) has stressed the nece~sity of differentiating-between premenstrua1 and syndromes. She s ugges ts tha th~ '. term \"syndr6me\" be reserved for specifie c1usters of symptoms experienced at severe 1eve1s, ~MS research to date has f&iled to fulfi1l these guidelines, a consensus can be g1earled from .-the li\u00b7terature as to WhlC'h tension, abdominal bloating, water reJentlon ~nd The centr..l1 features depression, fatigue, breast tend.erness. While the timing c,rlterla which defines the premenstrual phase varies \u00b7tremendously from study to study, 'a modal onset\" f of menses can be identlfled among major researchers in the et 1984). There are di fferences in opinion regarding whether patients must be comp1etely , asymptomatic dur in\\( a part1cula~ phase of the (Dalton, 1984), or whether slgn~ficant prem,nstrual exacerbation. of . symptoms, regardless of baseline values, estimates of the prevalence ?f PMS tend 'to be qui te inobnsistent from study to study as the y stem from . wide variatlons in definitional (cOl1egB students, mature wornen, psychiatric patients, PMS clinic patients) and the nature of the survey conducted (retrospective versus prospective investigation, menstrual focus of the study is known versus cpncealed). In recent years, however, there has been sorne concurrence regarding prevalence estimates among retrospective, epidemiolog ical surveys. Woods, Most and Dery (1982) conducted a survey of 18-35 year oid women (n=179) selected to reflect the racial composition and socioeconomic status of 5 Arnerican city ueighbourhoods. Approxirnately 30-5~% of the sample reported . common premenstrual symptoms (i.e. i ~ r i tabi li ty, de'lpression, -.. tension, swe1ling, painful breasts, headache) at -mild to. mo\u00e0erate levels. A much iower percentage (5-8%) rated these symptoms as severe or disabling, although 12% did rate their premenstrua1 irritability as severe. A'large~w~~ish epidemio1ogica1 study condu~ted by (reported in Bancroft & Backstrom, 1985) revea1ed that 2-3% of women premenstrual symptoms, whereas HJ%' s\u00e2id they wou1d wel\u00e9ome treatment for their (1985) his approximation ofl the p-reva1ence Il .. / an~,severity of PMS on the results of five published studies. The symptoms he c~nsidered pathognomonic for PHS -- included,anxiety, tension, irritability, fatigue, depression and headache; his rationa1e was that these are the symptoms wom~n are most likely to find disruptive. Reid estlmated that whereas 10-15% of wornen are symptom free, 50% report mild, 30% report moperate and 5-10% report severe or disab1ing ReId considers the experience-of rnoderate symptoms sufficiently dlstressing to be classified alongside severe syrnptoms as a prernenstrual Il syndrome\". \" To summarize, there i5 a rather consensus .. dis\u00e2b1ing prernznstrual syrnptorns. preva1ence estirnates must be regarded with caution, however, for recent studles have found that retro5pectlVe premenstrual symptom report . . .

Ttie Most frequently used questionnaire to date has been the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (HOQ) :1 . ',(Moos, 1968). Although originally constructed to measure -/ menstrual difficulties (e.g. dysmenorrhea), it has frequently been employed !n studies of PMS. The questionnaire consists of 47 items which are rated\"on a 6-point scale. -The original format was'retrospective and . ' asked respond\u00e8nt~ to rate their symptomatology during the < premenstrual, rnenstrual and interrnenstrual phases of their < MOSt ~ecent cycle, as weIl as during their worst cycl~. Subsequently a \"Today\" f?rm of the MDQ was developed to 1 allow for prospective rating of symptoms. Moo~ originally adrninistered his questionnaire to 839 young women recruited from~rnong the wives of graduate stude\u00b7nts.

The rationale for the sUbtyp\u00e8 hypothesis appears increasingly compelling as one examines the many and varie~ attempts (basically unsucc~ssful) to \" identify an etiologicat substrate for PMS. Etiological Theories of prem~ns~rual Symptoms d ~ A myriad of etiological theories have been advanced to J account for the premenstrual syndrome, ranging from the strictly biolo~ical eo the strictly psychological: A \\t sampling of these ~eories is presented in Table 1 {p. 1 17a-17b~; references are provided therein for theoretical or empirical papers relevant to each position. Although a few theories purport ta explain the entire gamut of premenstrual ~ . changes, many restrict themselves ta specifie subsets of premenstrual symptomatology, reflecting a widespread recognition\" of the multi/dimensional nature of the .. phenomenon. Each'one of the theories listed has garnered no better than equivocal supporf for its tenets. This can, in part, be att~ibuted to methodoloqical inconsistencies between studies but the cummulative confusion in the - c literature may also serve to underline the inh~rent complexity of the phenomenon under investigation.

Psychological Theories of premenstrual symptoms A number of factors, when considered together, suggest a potential psychogenic contribution to the etiology of PMS: (a) the failure to isolate a biological substrate for PMS, \" (b) the high placebo response rate detected in most J c01ltrolled treatment studies, (c) the similarity between premenstrua1 mood disturbances a~d certain psychiatrie d isprders, and (d) the ubiqui tous negati ve stereotypes held -concerning the debilitating \"effects of the premenstrual and menst~ual phases. rmplicit.in many psychological explanations of PMS has been the notion that the primary pathology lies in a woman's rea~tion t~nterpret~ti\u00f4n of her Tqe root 9f this pathology has been various1y conceived of as originating in social learning, ~ntrapsychie conflict, personality disiurbances or psychi\u00e0trie vulnerability.

'\\ A study frequently cited 'to indicate the salience of ~ expectation in symptom repo~ting was c~nducted by Ruble (1977). She led college fema1es to believe they were either in the premenstiual (1-2 days premenstrual) or ~ intermenstrual (7-l~ days premenstrual) phase of their cycles when they were aIl actually within 6-7 days of menses; a third group (controls) was told nothing: AlI groups filled out the Menstrual oistress Questionnaire ,based ~ 'on symptoms experjenced dUri?g the several preceding days.

She suggested that women are inclined to overstate their ~xperierice of physlcal chan~es when they believe they are premenstrual.

An alternate interpretation of Ruble's-results, then, could be that women convinced they are intermenstrual tend to downplay their physi~logical complaints or attribute them to something other than the mer.st,rual cycle a conclusion which clea~ly has different ramlfication<s. Critique of the social le,arning l1terat.ure. The social learning perspective clearly did fill Il 9~P in the early \"\" 24 , . literature on PMS. It isvnow widely recognized that in any .- experience of illness or physical distress there are accompa~ying psychological and social dimensions which interact to determine the illness experience; PMS is a prime candidate for such a biopsychosocial conceptualization. As a result of research findings arising from the social le~rning perspective, investigations of PMS now pay greater . , \" heed to the influence of demand charact\u00e9ristics, prospective ratings of symptomatology are considered standard practice and efforts have been made to seek methods other than self-report to assess ~nd validate symptom experience. There may be limitations, however, to the , generalizability of mu ch of the social learning literature. - . Almost the entire body of findings concer~ing the influence of beliefs, cultural stereotypes and demand characteristics on reports of premenstrual symptoms are based on r~latively asymptomatic groups of healthy young women or those reporting very mild level~ of change. The premenstrual MDQ' scores of college students and young, normal women (Gruba ~ Rohrbaugh, 1975 and MOos, 196~ -respectively) tend to be approximately half those reported by a sev~re PMT group (Haskett \u00e9t al., 1980), suggesting tha~the two populations may not be comparable. Recent evidence indicates that the prospective ratings of women with severe symptomatology are more likely ta confirm their retrospective symptoms accounts (Abplanalp, .. 1983; Endicott & ,. / -severely affected wornen, influence of expectatlon and belief rnay be less sallent.

According to Freud, women believe they originally possessed a penis and lost it; this results in; penis envy as weIl as recurre~t states of rage during menstruation when the'flow of blood serveS to remind them of their castration. A woman's compensation for her deficient status is provided , by the b\u00eaaring of children, symbollzing a substitute for the 105'1: penis. Each menstrual period, then, takes on a further meaning of loss as it represents a failure to conceive. Women purportedly repress aIl this rage and disappointment only to have it resurface again,during reproductive crises such as menarche, menstruation, childbirth and menopause, when evidence of tbeir deftcient status is most salient. approach~ to ieminine identity --including pregnancy, childbirth, castration, penis envy and t aggression. Therese Benedek (1950) proposed that the ~anifestations of severe premenstrual t~nsio~ reflect 1 particularly intense C1nfl!cts con~e~ning ferninine,identity. The pioneer effort to investigate the relationship' between'psychodynamic processes and menstrual cycle phase 26 or, ; c p ( \u00b7 ; o was carried out by Benede~ and Rubenstein ,(l939a, 1939b). A longitudinal study of 15 ~men who were in psychoanalytic therapy was conductedi Bened~k recorded and analyzed content of the analytic sessions wnile Rubenstein tracked.the ~at ients 1 hormonal changes nal smears and basal # body temperatura recordings. Assessments of cycle phase. / made independently by the two authors ~ere strikingly similar and revealed consistent relationships between variations in hormone production and the ~ynamic content of ~ free association and dream material. Estrogen pro4U~tion was related to active, extroverted strivings and heterosexual libido. At ovulation, . passive-receptive tendencies emerged as womep prep~red biolo~ically and emotionally for conception .If Jrustrat,ed 1 in their desire to receive a mate, emotional tension could increase in this phase. After ovulation and until the premenstrual phase, feelings of relaxation and well-being l , generally continued. As progestin levels peaked in the midluteal pha~ wishes for impregnation and motherhood become more cons ci ous, but a woman 1 s conf 1 i cts ,wi th qer own G mother could result in rears of motherhood'or a hostile def~nsiveness against it. The decline of estrogen and progesterone in the premenstrual phase, often perceived as a rel~tive deficiency by women, could result in partial regress~on to pregenital concerns. Symptoms varied greatly across women but the ego seemed to regress and frustrations 27 \\ a \\ l / \\ 1 / , became unbearable leading to crankiness, fatigue, anger, and J , crying spells -in general an overall reduc~ion in the control of emotion.

They presented a model which integrated \u00e0 woman's~sexual cyele and sexual feeling? with ,her emoti,onal life, yet retained an appreciation of ~he inherent pomplexity of the phenomenon. One of the major criticisms of their work concerns the reliability and validlty of psychoanalytic \", . interpr~ions of dream and fre~ association material, J~~ , which tend to be considered \"so~t ~easures\" by today's standards. Given the biological determinism J' adu1t woma~ into regulated channels\" (Benedek, 1950, p. 232), - 0- , and the difficulty of remaining completely blind to a patient's menstrual ~ycle phase, one cannot assume that the ter bias did not color Benedek's interpretations o~ aterial. There i8 a180 sorne ambiguity concerning ~ health of Benedek and Rub\u00e8nstein's sample, 28 \" o and the genera~izability of their findings . Analytic theorists which followed Freud tended to be 1 somewhat 1ess literaI in thei~ conceptua1ization of penis envy (Horney, 1967). the female-role became associated more w1th envy r\u00e9garding man's power and social pres tIge than any anatomi cal advantage. The appl i cat i on of revisions in, analytic thought ta menstruaff cycle research led to the hypothesis that women ~ho rejected their feminine identity and resented their traditional fema1e roles wou1d be more at oddd with their physiology and suffer more \"'10 menlStrual and premenstrual distress. 1 Research based on this notion has yie1ded inconsistent 'findings. Several studies (Fortin, Wittko,Yler & Kalz,' 1958; . May, 1976) have conc1uded that women who suffer from PMT are less content with traditional feminine raIes. May, nowever, ': based his conclusion on marginal1y significant findings, and , Fortin based his on impressions gathere~ rather unsystematica11y from analytic;lly oriented interviews. More recent and empirica11y convincing studies have found either no corr~lation between premenstrual distress and acceptance.of the femali role (Berry & McGuire~ 197~: Watts, Dennerstein & Horne, 1989) or have found that premenstrual \\ ' complaints are more common in traditional women who score high on standardized fernininity scales (Gough, 1975; Stout & / .

Critique of the psychoanalytic Literature. The major criticisms of analytically-oriel'lted' investigations of the t menstiual cycle involve their lack of empirical figor and their relative imperviousness to alternative interpr~tations of observed relationships. The validity and reliability of . psychoanalytic interpretations of dream and free-association material can be questioned, as can the relevance of intrapsychic events for actual behavior. In their favor, l\u00e9 r analytic studies do provi\u00e0e alternative measures ta 1 self-report which has been \u00e0emonstrated to be biased,by f ~ memory, demand and s tereotyped be1),efs. When vi ewed wi thi n' the context of analytic theory, granted its clearly stated assumptions, such investigations prov~de subtle insights and potential clues which may be helpful in achieving an , , d d' t4 f 1 h lntegratlve un ers tan lng 0 premenstrua p enomena. For instance, the \"subjective\" interpretation of a pfemenstrual '-~.P decline in ego strength was subsequently demonst~ated with \" an objective measur~ (Hammond & ~~ye, 1985). The careful observation of phenomena,.which is the hallmark oi analytic studies, i5 of inherent value in the delineation of ~ relationships which can be followed up empirically . Personality Research -3e c c ( . Numerous studies have re)orted significan.t correlations b~tween complaints of menstrual distress and poot adjustment or neuroticism; fewer studies have focused specifically on premenstrual complaint and adjustment. Positive '. correlations between premenstrual complaints and neuroticism . , ~ have been detected in studies employing the Neurotic1sm scaies of both the nventor~ (Taylor; 1979; Watts et al., 1980), as weIl as the Minnesota Muitiphasic Personality Inventdry (Gruba & Rohrbaug~ 1975). , Several studies ) or to premenstruai variations in psyohologicai symptoms while physical symptoms did not covary with adjustment (Clare, 1983; Gruba & Rorbaugh, 1975). SeveraL i nves t iga tors found s ign i f i cant di fferences in t~ait anxiety between women complaining of premenstrual J symptoms and controls (Halbreich & Kas, 1977; Mira, Vizzard, & Abraham, 1985). -Premenstrual sufferers reported higher levels of trait anxiety in general --in the follicular as \" weIl as luteal anx iety scores i ncreased' s igni f i cant ly in the 1 uteal phase. 1 In both studies the authors concluded that their instruments (Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Spielberger Trait Anxfety ,/ Inventory) rnay reflect an \"anxiety proneness\" which can be exacerbated 31 ...... 1\"\" . , .1 .. var i at ion in a presumed tra i t var iable sugg'\u00e8S ~s tha t lthe cycle phase during whicb subjects are assessed should be ta ken into.account. \\ Further support for this notion was demonstrated by Hammond and Keye J1985), who reported that Minnesota -Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) results are also s'usceptible to marked fluctuations across menstrual cycle phase. Tes t sess ions conducted, in the lu tea l phase revea led statistically significant elevations on MMPI scales 1,2,3,4,6,7,8, and\u00b70 as weIl as on a composite index of conscious anxiety in compa~ison to sessi~ns conducted with the same subjects in the follicular phase of the cycle. Scale scores reflecting ego strength, der1ved from the MMPI, \"\" . were significantly reduced in the luteal phase. The authors emphasized the significant impact of cycle phase on any measure of person'al adjustment --even those assumed to represent stable personality traits. Few studies investigating personality variables have drawn a distinction between neuroticism and neurosi~, altho\u00f9gh there tends to be ah implicit consensus that they lie along a continuum of personal stability from the normal stable individual, to those with neurotic personality traits, to the severely neurotic maladjusted patient. Rees (1953), in his investigation o~ neuroticism, neurosis, and PMT, devised a systematic although idiosyncratic method of -..., \\ assessing'degree of neurosis. His composite index was based on family history, childhood neurosis, adjustment at school, 3-2 .... , \"\"., ( , ' work \u00e0nd marriage, clinical assessment of general stability\" - and diagnostic type, as weIl as several psychometrie measures of neuroticis~. ~remenstrual tension was more frequentIy reported among neurotic subjects, in whom the intensity oJ premenstrual syrnptoms was posltively correlated with the severity of neurosis. Howe~er\" Rees also noted the presence of PMT in normal women with no evidence, of neuroticism. Within the normal group, a comparison of women reporting PMT with those who did not, showed no significant \\ differences in any index of personality instability or neuroticism. Rees aiso repor~ed that psychiatrie therapy could improve affecting women's'PMT while ~MT was alleviated in sorne patients by, pharmacolog~c treatment without affecting their neuroses. Rees proposed an interactive model of PMT ta account -, for his findings: bodily changes'occuring premenstrually -(and varying in the degree\"of underlying hormonal abnormality) are reacted to in various ways depending on f~ctors such as personality type, existing neuroses, \\ attitudes or environmental stress. Women with abnormal , endocrine functions who are 'otherwise well-adjusted may , experience changes equi~alent to those that a more neurotic woman would in relation to relatively normal endocrine events. Rees' formulatfon foreshadowed recent trends to conceptualize prernenstrual~complaint within an interactive, framework. Rees' \u00e2ttention to the distinction between neuroses and neuroticism, and his careful assessment of , \\ ., , , led that normal wQrnen, ~ fre~ from-neuroticisrn, aiso complained of premenstruai tension. i Support ,for the presence of premenstrual cOl'I!plaint in . 1 women without evidence of personality proble~s has been sporadic but consistgnt. Cullberg (1972), in a sample of .. women deemed to suffer premenstrua1 syndrome, noted that .J \\ ...... -11 on1y 26% had high neurotici~m scores on the Eysenck Persona li ty 1 nventorYi 'these women tended to ra te thei r ,premenstrual sy\",ptoms as more severe than di,d the 74\\ F PHS sufferers with Iow neuroticism scores. Clare (1977), assessed bot'h 'non-psychot i c psych ia tri c morbid i ty -- measured with ~he General Health Questionnaire --and premenstrual s~mptoms in patients p;esenting to general_ -practice and ta a PMS clinic. What was striki~g was the , very high prop6rtion of women t 67% repoited_ PHS. On the other'hand, ~~en scoring positive for PHS wer\u00e8 equally likely ta.be 'd~fied as psychiatrically ill or healthy. A more thorough analysis of these sarnples' reports (Clare, 1983) revealed that psychiatrical~y ill PHS sufferers complained of significantly more symptoms and of greater , . severity than did psychiatrically healthy PHS sufferers. This was rnainly accounted for by their greater endorsement of' psycho16gical symptGms (particularly negative affect), while the two groups did not differ in their rep~rt of ... and steptoe (1985), in thei r pros pest i ve study of premenstrual complaint, also assessed psychiatric health with the ,General HeaLth Questronnaire (GHQ) and utilized the daily forro of the MOQ for prospec~ive symptom \\ .recording.

Most of the research on personallty factors and PMS lS based on retrospectlve report qf premenstrual symptomatology. Recent studies have shown retrpspective report to be unrellable; subjects are often found ta have more diffuse and widespread symptoms.

They compared the res'ponses of women admltted premenstrually or menStrually with those admitted during the remainder of the cycle.: There were no ~ifferences between groups, suggestlng that premenstrual syndrome makes no speclfic contribution to premenstrual or menstrual admi~sions, but qeems rather to exert an additive effect on the psychotic process, much as en environmental stressor might. unfortunately, this study failed to distinguish between type: of psychoses (affectiv\"e vera us schizophrenic) which, as will be demonstrated shortly, has been revealed to be an Important variable. \\ There have been frequent c,ase reports desct' ibing the 38 c l, .. , ( recurrence of psychosis in the premenstrua1 phase with a rapid resolution of symptoms following menstruation menstrual psychosis\"[ app~ar to be relative1y rare, a1though survey data are not available. Several treatment studies using lithium --which has -generally proven inaffective for PMS --point to an interesting link between PMS and psychiatrie illnes5. Fries (1969) reported that lithium provided relief to two of five patients who complained of severe PMS. Both these women were thought to have \"affectiv~ personality disorders\". Deleon-Jones, Val, and Herts (1982) rep6rted a good reponse , . to lithium in a woman with a l0-year history of severe, recurrent 2remenstrual irritability and hostility which was accompanied by marked premenstrua1 elevations in .MHPG excret,ion. _ Manic-depressive illness thium effe,cti vely MHPG levels to ( normal and toe patient's affective symptoms showed a 1 complete remission. The authors concluded that there may be a subgroup of women with subsyndromal affective disorders whose symptoms are triggered during the premenstrua1 phase. This hypothesis gaiflS sorne support from a treatment study cond~cte\u00e0 by Steiner, Haskett, Osmun and car~p11 (1980), who adrninist,ered to with severe dysphorie ~ . premenstrual symptoms, but-no hist'ory of major psychiatric 39 a . ; (J disorder. The treatment proved beneficial (and tolerable) to only three women, ~nd it was subsequently determined that they aIL met diagnostic criteria for \"subsyndromal\" , affective disorder (i .e. cyclothymia). a family 9istory of affective illness. Two of the three had J Steiner and calleagues noted that while lithium seemed ta allevlate cyclothymie features, it may not have directly affected the women' s PMT (physical symptoms were unchanged),\" made'them more able to cope with it by distress. , This notion of an additive relationship between PMS and psychiatrie disarder is slmilar to the conclusIon drawn by Zola et al. (1979). There lS increasing evidence, however, to suggest an Interactive relationshlp between premenstrual mood changes --var4ausly psychiatrie illness of an affectIve nature. With respect to hospital admissions, for instance, Abramowltz, Baker, & -Fleischer (1982) found that while admissIons for both schizophrenie and depressed patients were disproportionately hlgh during the paramenstruum (4 da ys premenstrual plus first 4 days of menses), this phenomenon held mueh more , strongly for depressed patients (69%) than for sehizophr.enie patIents 137%). In fact, 40% o~ aIl depression admissions were eonfined to the last premenstrual day and the first day of menses., In att:empting to explain this striking finding, the~authors noted that estrogen leveis are very law on these 49 c L , .' days; low estrogen has been eould cause catecholamine 4epletion and -:~; in a depressive episode in predisposed individuals (Schildkraut, 1965). Although an association betw'een premenstrual dysphorie mood changes and affecti ve d isorder has been noted in many studies the year\"s & steege, 1985), i t of ten represented an ext raneous fi nd i ng and was rarely the direct focus of i nterest. More recent1y, reSearch has been designed to speeifically address this question. Th\u00e8 , investigation has proceeded along several lines of inquiry: 1. The incidence of bath premenstrua1 mood ~hange and various- psychiatrie diagnoses has been assessed in / unse1ected samp1es. 2. Women reporting premenstrua1 mood chan,ge have been \\ followed up ta assess i nci dence of subsequent psych i a tric illness. \\ 3.

History of psychiatrie Illness was diagnosed according to the Feighner criterIa (Felghner et \" al., 1972), but the symptom durat i on required to dl agnose depX'essive syndrome was reduced to two weeks from four. Premenstrual affectlve syndrome (PAS) wa~ deflned as moderatfi! or severe?experience of at least and one somatic symptom. A signl ficant relationshlp was detected between the incidence of affectIve dlsorder and reports of PAS: 65% of subjects with a history of affectIve disorder (28 of 43) reported PAS, while only 18% of a11 r e ma i n i n 9 s u b j e c t s W 1 t h no h 1 S t 0 r y 0 f de pre s s ion (1 4' w i t h o the r p s;y~ h 1 a t r 1 c 111 ne s 5 , 2 1% w i t h no p s y ChI a t [ 1 C i 11 ne 5 s ) ... , ... . The fact that PAS was not just a function exper ieticed 1 t . \" of psychiatrie lllness by the following statistics: 92% of hysterlcs ,w,ith a concurrent depressive disorder reported PAS, while none of the hysterics without relat,ed depression did 50. The authors conc1uded that an increased frequency of premenstrual affective change ia associated with a his.tory of depressive disorder; they speculated that physiological and/or psychological stress associated with the changes of the menstrual cycle may make ,manifest a predisposi~ion for affective disorder: , 0 Endicott, Halbreich,\u00b7Schacht and Nee (1981) further ,/ c purs ued th i s line of i nqui r y but were much more r igorous in their delineation of premenstrual symptomatology. Their l , subjects, however, represented a very heterogeneous group including patients who had been treated for depression or panic disorder but were currently euthymic, relatives of , these and other Ipatients, as well as a small number of community controls.1 Women reporting a conste1'lation of met . were assessed for 1ifetime history of psychiatrie disorder according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (ROC) (Spitzer, Endicott and RObins, 1978). ThE;! syrnptom duration required by the ROC for a diagnosis of major affective disorder is ; ,- only one week. The PAF'typological categories were modelled ~fter the RDC in content, but do not demand a minimum }urat i on. Of thos e women repor ting a maj or depress i ve syndrome premenstrua11y: 62% evidenced a history of major \\ affective disorder, 50% of another affective disorder (e.g. i nterm i ttent depress ion), 33% of a nonaf f ect i ve di sorder (e.g. anxiety disorder), and 7% had no history of mental disord~r. Th\u00e8 overrepresentat ion of a history of depression \" , -,I>t.. in women complaining of depressi.ve s~ptoms premenstrua.lly led the authors to suggest that premenstral depressive s~ndrorne may represent a mi Id or subclinical manifestation / of affective disorder.\u00b7 In a subsequent publication, Halbreich- and Endicott (1985b) presented data gathered from five different 1 43 \u00b7a 1 .. , . .. . ' including sorne of the subjects from the 1981 study cited , .above. Their groups included: previous inpatients who had been depressed, relatives of patients, controis for these relatives, and two samples who responded to posted notices seekin9 subjects' for menstrual cycle research --o'ne of Q which consisted only of subjects who had completed daily ratings, and were confirmed to experience either significant premenstrual changes or little change premenstrually. Subjects assigned a lifetime history of major depressive disorder accordi'ng to the RDC were comparecd to those wi th no history ~f mental illness regarding the degree to which they complalned ,of depre.ssion premenstrually. The data for all . \\, five samples, when combined, indicated that women with a history of depression (57%) were more likely than those without (14%) to complain of premenstrual depression. There are several'questions \"which arise from the data \\ presented in the papers mentioned above. Firstly, their figures for 1ifetime history of affective illness are quite high in relation to epidemiological survey rates (Robins et al. 1 1 9 8 4') For exarnple, Halbreich and Endicott (1985b) found rates of 42%, 61', and 71% in their control group, relatives of patients, and first posted notice sample respectively. This might suggest that their criteria for diagnosing 1ifetime history are too lenient, or that the groups surveyed are somewhat id i osyncrat i c. 1 n suppor t of the latter explanation, a comparison of the filat posted notice group which was selected tetrospectively, with the 44 / , c \\ c 1 5,econd whose symptoms were prospective1y confirined, revea1s more than tw i ce the i nci dence of affect ive i Ilnes5 in the .'~ \u00b7retrospectively chosen sampl\u00e8 (71% subj close to, that reported by DeJong et al. (1985) in the ~ only other pubfished anal~sis of a confirmed sample (ta be \" reviewe~ in section 4). This sU9gests that -the other faur groups which are represented in Halbr\u00e8ich and Endicott's 'surveys may have a higher than average history of affecti ve illness, perhaps due to the manner in which they were selected (i.e. ex-patients, their relatives, notices posted \\ in medical eenters). The same might be true of the subjects studied by Kasni,wagi et al. (1976) --that is, women with ~., . . funetional headache who presented at a neurology Cllnle for evaluation. Halbreich and Endicott's figures can be quite J misleading when, for instance, they invert their data and report tha t of those women wi th pre\"mens t ruaI depress i on, history of affectiye il!ness, whi1e anly 9% were never mentally ill. 'It is important to keep in mind th-at this data 1 ike1 y has 1 imi ted generali zabil i ty beyond the 1 idiosyncratie composite sampl!3 assessed by Ha1breich and - Endicott (I98\u00b7Sb). The majority of findings discussed in the previous section did rest on retrospective' report of premenstru~l symptoms and, gr\u00e0nted the potenti\u00b7a1 for distortion in such reports, their validity could be questioned. Nevertheless, 4S Cr o sorne manner of relationship between premenstrual mood' \\ changes and affective disorder is suggested. Further support for such a relationship was generated by two l\u00b7ongitudinal studies designed to assess psychiatrie\u00b7 morbidity in women reporting premenstrual affective cha.nges. - 3 Longitudinal stud~es of premenstrual affective syndrome. Wetzel, Reich, McClure and Wald (1975) conducted a fo\u00f9r-year prospective study of female college students. They found that those who initial.Iy reported a \"premenstrual 1 affective syndrome (PAS) were significan-tly more likely than those who did not, to seek psychiatrie help' and to be diagnosed with an affective disorder within the next four years. Although these data are suggestive of an association between PAS and affective illness, they have ofterr been interpreted to suggest that PAS is a risk factor for the development of affective Blness. This conclusion goes somewhat beyond the da ta: because the st udents \\IIere not initially assessed for affective illoess (e\u00cfther curr\u00e8nt or pas t) when they .entered ~he s tudy, it i s imposs i ble to conc1ude which disorder they experienced \u00b7firat Pf\\S or clinical depression. ~chuckit, Oa1y, Herrman and found that co1lege \"atudents reporting a premenstrual affe.ctive syndrome, when compared to those who did not, had a h1gher incidence of both previous depressions '<11% vs. 5% . j, respectively) and fami1y histories of affective illness (18' vs. 10\\ respectively).

The authors 'attributed the lack of \\ 1 significan\u00e8e' to th~ Ivery smaI1 numbers of student who became \" . psychiatrically i 11 dur ing t,h'e course of the study. 3. Premenstrual mood change in psychiatrie patients Di amond et al.

Although the authors ruled out current psy\u00b7chia.tr i c disorder in the control subjects; they d,id not assess 1 if etime the pa t,ient sample (n=63) du, to the fact that over two-thirds of the hea1thy l' 47 ') . , j 1 S, r. o ., women refused to participate in the study.' This may c ~dicate that those oontrols who Qid volunteer had a partic~lar problem with premenstrual symptoms. \u00c2n'alternative, although pur~ly sp~cu!ative that disorder Feighner's original wh'ich requires symptom 'duration of one month) 1 , while those studies emplo~ing a more lenient duration r' criteria (1-2 weeks) \u00b7may be di\u00ebignosing as affective disorder women who mere~y experience premenstrual depression for one to two weeks ,Of every mOlth. In fact, Diamond' s affective disorder group consi~ted of a high percentage of ,bipolar patients, in contrast to the unipolar patients involved' in most other investigations of PMS. Another poss i ble \" , explanation for the high rate of PMO reported by the control 1 ~ subjects, and the comparable rate reported by the bipolar patients, is that the criteria for PMO was simply too lenient with the result that both groups had similar~y \\ inflated rates for PMD.

These findings suggest an interaction between affective illness and '\" chara,cter pathology, which the authors speculate may be 1\" mediated by premenstrual deficits in ego funetioding. ft is -- interesti ngr to note. that se'x di fferences have been detected in the ,prevalen\u00e7e of the \"borderline\" diagnosis wpich are identical (I.e. 2:1) to those found for major depression ...

The authors suggest a number of explanati6n~ for these discrepancies, including the fact that the ~ajority of \"- patients,in ot~er surveys have been unipolar depressives, and that the criteria used to diagnose premenstrual mood change in these samples was quite lenient. Of interest he~ is the similar fai1ure of Diamond et al. (1976) to detect a difference between his largely bipolar group and controls in their reports ~f PMD. Rather, equivalently high rates or depression were reported by both groups, suggesting either that the criteria Diamond and colleagues used for PMD was too lenient or that supjects' retrospective reports were' inflated. Roy-Byrn\u00e8 and colleagues also acknowledge that / their sarnple rnay contain sorne false negatives, as they did not follow the two affective disorder groups prospectively / to ensure that they did not ~ctually experience premenstrual , mood changes. Another possibility for the much lower concordance rates detected by Roy-Byrne and colleagues is / / that the diagnosis of bipo1ar and seasonal affective disorder was fairly rigorous in their study and perha~s uneonfounded by women suffering from prolonged premen~trual depression. 4. Lifetime psyehiat~ic history in wornen with premenstrual complaint St~ut, Steege, Blazer and George (1986) compared- rates oftlifetime psychiatrie diagnoses of women attending a 51 j l' j \\ . - , premenstrual syndrome clinie to those obtained in a large epidemiological surve'y of eompa\"rable women. The NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) (Robins, Helzer, Crougham & Rateliff, 1981) was administered d4ring th~ follicular\" phase to women seeking treatment for PMS, to assess lifetime incidence of DSM-III disorders. PMS women met criteria eor dysthymia, somatization disorder, phobla, \" obsessive-eompulsiv~'9isorder, aleohol abuse/dependence and drug abuse/dependence to a greater extent than did the community sample. A rather unexpected finding was that the incidence of major depressive episode (0.9%) in the PMS sample was significantly lower than that found in the community sample (7.2%), and not at aIl comparable to previous report~ of a 62-65% lifetime incidence ~f depression in women complaining of premenstrual syndrome . (Endicott et al., 1981; Haskett, Steiner & Carroll, 1984). Stout et al. (1986ry attribute the discrepancy to differences in. the duration criteria employed across studies in the \" diagnosis of major depressive disorder: Both Endicott et al. (1981) and Haskett et al. (198.4) used Research Diagnostic Criteria which demand a one week duration Qf symptoms in compar ison to the\" 2 weeks used in the current study. supp~rting this explanation is evidence that a high proportion of the PMS patients studied by stout and co1leagues did report suicidaI ideation (63%) an~ suicide , attempts (15%), implying that depressive symptoms associated with the premenstrual phase may be very severe, yet 52 c ,~-, shor t-li ved. The incidence of dysthymia detec~by Stout and colleagues, ho~ever, was considerably higher in women seeking treatment for PMS (21%) than in the community ~ (3.6%). The depression charateristic of dysthymia may be \"either relatively persistent or intermittent and separated by periods of normal mood, interest, and pleasure ..... , normal periods may last a few days to, a few weeks\" (OSM-III, p. 221). It is quite fea,sible that women who had been suffering recurrent premenstrual depression from 1 -14 days \" of each month, for more ~han several years, might be diagnosed with dysthymic disorder. The issue of depressive diagnosis aside, the incidence of any lifetime psychiatric diagnosis in stout et al.Is sample was considerably higher in PMS patients (81%) than in the community (35%). This could be attributed to the fact that the sample surveyed had not been screened for 1 psychiatric'disorder, nor had they been s\u00e8reened with pr'ospecti ve rati ngs to veri fy tha t their compl,a i nts \u00b7were confined to the premenstrual pha~e of the,cycle. Clinicians have consistently noted that among those women seeking treatment for PMS, there is a proportion whose psychological difficulties are more widespread,o~ noncyclic, and.suggested that psychiitric disord\u00e9r ls (Hamilton et al., 1985ai Haskett & ,Abplanalp\" 1983). An investigation somewhat similar to that of stout et 1 53 a \" , al. (1986), conducted by Mackenzie, Wilcox and Baron (1986) with an unselected sample, will be reported in this section for ease of comparison. The authors solicited volunteers to participate in a study of ~aily changes in health and behavior; the me~strual cycle focus of the study was . disguised. Subjects we~~ cJassified according to their global retrospe,tive report of none/mild or moderate/severe perimenstrual (i.e. premenst~ual and menstrual) difficulties. Subsequent reports of premenstrual symptoms on the Premenstrual Assessment Form (PAF) confirmed that these classifications were also valid for premenstrual difficulties alone. Lifetime DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses were assessed .with the DIS (Robins et al, 1981). The \\ moderate/severe PHS group exhibited significa?tiy higher l' rates of affective disorder (unipolar, bipolar and dysthymia) (45% vs. 21%) and drug abuse (21% vs. ,,%) in , comparison t~ the none/mild group, but Jdid not differ from .' t hem i n ter m s 0 f ove r a Il p s y chi a tri, c d i 0 r der ( 6 6 % vs. 4 5 %) Mackenzie and colleagues concluded p\u00b0'remens trual difficulties are associated with a 1 disorder and suggested that the tw share a 4 common set of factors which individNal's vulnerability to'both; Several interesting points can b~ by comparing the last two stUdi~ which assessed psychiatrie history in an . .identieal manner in women reporting PHS and either seeking treatment or note Firstly it is important to note that .. 54 c \" c \" , . although Mackenzie et al.ts sample was classified as moderate or severe PMS suff~rers, their PAF cutoff point of 1 Il or more symptoms, (of a possible 95) rated moderate to extrerne suggests they May represent a relative1y rnild1y affected group. The present author found that confirmed premenstrual depression sufferers reported a Mean of 42 symptoms (sd=13) at similar severity levels. The apparently mi Idly affected sample, then, of Mackenz i e et al. (1986), in comparison to the women studied by stout et al.

Hypotheses suggested by the. di screpanci es . between the findings of stout et al. (1986) and Mackenzie et . al. (1986) inclilde: (a) statistics concerning women see~ing treatment for PMS are confounded by the influence of pathological subgroups, (~) rna~y wo~en with a history of depression complain of premenstrual mood changes but May not seek treatrnent for tQem (perhaps they regard them as . relatively rnanageable in relation to full-blown affective episodes). or (c) severe \\MS sUff~rers are relati\u00b7vely healthy. psychologically (as p~r Haskett et al., 1980) bu~ include a subgroup of wornen vulnerable to depression. l t ils becomi ng. i ncreas ing1y apparent tha t the nature of . 1 the population samp1ed, and the assessment instrument used, play a critical role in determ~ning the degree af relationship between PMS eomplaint and psychiatrie history. 55 o JI p ( o () fJ 4- Yet decidedly problematic issue in aIl the studies just ussed is the fai1ure to screen subjects, either -- J with interviews or prospective daily diaries, to are a true premenstrual syndrome sample, more pervasi~e psychiatrlc disturbance. the few studies to incorporate this critical methodO',1og cal step was conducted by DeJong et al. (1985). Fifty-seve subjects complaining of mood'and physical enstrually were assigned psychiatric diagnoses based on th Schedule for Affective Disorders and -Lifetime Version (SADS-L) (Spitzer & Endicott, 1 They were divided into'three groups: no p s y chi a tri c dia 9 nos i s ( n = 2 1), h i s t 0 r y 0 fat l e as ton e ma j 0 r depressive episode (n=24), and other psychiatric diagnoses (n=12). On t~e basis of daily ratings carried out over three menstrua1 cycles, the authors confirmed a specific- . premenstrual increase in dysphorie mo09 in 58% of their sampIe. Of those confirmed in their report of premenstrual mood change, 3e % had a' hi s tory of maj or depress ive di sorder , 15% of another psychiatrie disorder, and 55% had no psychiatric history. What was most striking, however, was the remarkably high proportion of nonconfirme9 subjects who --had a history of psychiatric disorder (88%), particularly of affective disorder (58%). Although the af fecti ve illness i~ confirmed PMS subjects may be quite high, it represents ha If\" of what has commonly been reported in st\u00f9dies based on retrospective PMS assessment. /\" 56 c' l ... '. DeJong and co1leagues conclude that such estima tes are in /' all probability inaccurate, reflecting the high degree of affective path~logy characteristic of subjects who fail to prospectively conflrrn their reports of PHS. In summary, th~two studies concerning the incidence of . .' past episodes of affective il1~ss in rates of 30-32%. Apparently, previ~usly reported rates in the region of 62-100% were inflated by the tendency for women with a history of psychiatrie illness, particularly affective-illness, ta complain of depressive changes in the premepstrual phase that could not be substantiated by daily ratings. Reasons for this lack of confirmation are rarely quantified, but typically include the presence of more pervasive aepression, the lack of depressive changes at aIl,' or changes which fail to meet the criteria for significant/premenstrual increase (i.e. 30% gre~ter pre~enstrually compared to postrnenstually). premenstrual report among wo~en w~th past affective illness suggests several reasons .. why they May erroneously attribute their mood changes to the menstrual cycle: (a) they have a history ~f premenstrual . mood'change~ in addition to episod\u00e8S, typica11y appeaJ:;\u00e9d\u00b7 'or or unconsciously , . seek to attribute negative moods to biologica1 sources . \" . rather than to psychol~9ical or, social factors. The latter 57 .' a ,. explanation, although commonly invoked, is .not weIl supported by the data: There is no ready explanation of why women with depression, but not those with schizophrenia or anxiety, would confine their report of symptoms to one phase of the menstrual cycle. Little empirical evidence concerning the long-term course of PMS exists, but clinicians often report that the severity and the actual presence of symptoms tends to vary from cycle to cycle and .... can be exacerbated'by life stress (Rose ~ Abplanalp, 1983). It is quite possible, then, that nonconfirmed subjects d\u00f4' experience premenstrual depression during cyeles other than those surveyed, or that it has been a common enough. experien\u00e9e in their past that they have noted the association. Premenstrual Depression as ~ Model for Affective Illness?

In a ,carefully screened sample of severe premenstrual tension. f, ~ (PMT) sufferers, Haskett et Al.

Sadness and dyspho~ia were more 58 c c ./ commonly r~orted by \u00e0 subset of their sample who exhibited -J /elevated symptomatology during th~ follicular, as weIl as, the luteal phase. The .authors suggested that premenstrual -depression represented a worsening of underlying psychopathology, and did not repres~nt a \"pure\" premenstrual syndrome. Cullberg (1972) also drew a aistinction between premenstrual irritability and depression. He noted trends in the data oi women with premenstrual irritability suggestive of specifie hormonal responsivity: they reacted \" , adversely to an estrogen dominant preparatio~ but showed some relief with a gestagen dominant preparation. Hormonal responsivity in subjects with premenstrual depression was ambiguous; as weIl, they showed a stronger association with neurot~cism, leading the authors to conclude t~at subjects with.premenstrual depression wete less clearly influenced by hormonal factors. Haskett, Steiner a arro11 (1984) further investigated the clini al and endocrine functionfng of their severe P~t sample in an effort to detect potential commona1ities with depressive di~order. , 0 The PMT subjects failed meet for rn~jor dep'ression during -the premenstrual phase, rnainly because they did not achieve the duration criteria. The a~th~rs al~o pofnt\u00ead out thaf their clinical features did not resemble those of endogenous depression. Additionally, two measures of adrenocortical funcioning --urinary free and ;53 p .. \", / . Suppression Test --which are abnormal in many patients ~ith endogenous depression, yielded normal values and no \" significant differences between premenstrual and follic~lar measurements. Haskett an~ colleagues concluded that premenstrual tension syndrpme did not appear useful as a model for endogenous depression. This concl~sion is 'sqpported by premenstrual Assessment Form (PAF) questionnaire results indicating thatoendogenous depressive features are rarely reported premenstrually (Halbreich et al., 1982). Halbreich, Endicott and Nee (1983) note, however,', that severe clinical' depression often .lacks end6genous features. Ttiey suggest that commonly reported premenstrual dysphorie and hostile' depr&ssive f~atures, resemble . nonendogenous depressive conditions and may have relevance for an increased understandJng of such conditions Overview of Premenstrual Syndrome Literature Despi te the va\u00a7it gro'wth in of 'publ ished } studies conc~rning the premenstrual syndrome within the past l0,years, in many ~ays'this research field can be regarded as still in an early phase of development. The fact th\u00e2t much of the research to date has been conducted using heterogeneous definitiond of PMS, divergen~ populations \\ (e.g. college students, psychiatrie patients, severe PMS sufferers), and a variety of assessment instruments precludes ~ truly integrative summary of the literature. Several conclusions seem warranted, however, from,the sheer 60 / \u00b7c <' , o / curnmulative weight of the available findings. A proportion of women' clearly do exper ience fluctuations in symptoms i'n tandem with th~ phases of the m\u00e9nstruaJ cycle. \u00e9omplaints of dysphoric mood and physical syrnptotns are most comm'on dur ing the premenstrual and menstrual phases of the \"cycle. In terrns of prevalence; a CI- distinction must be drawn between the premenstrual symptoms whi ch Many women exper i ence to a mi rd' degree, and a \"syndrome\" of premenstrual changes which seerns restricted to a m~ch smailer proport ion of women (2-10 %) --tri though there '\" is little consensus as to the content, severity or timing\" criteria for a premenstrual \"syndrome\", its diagnosis is usdally dependent ~p6n behavioral sequellae such as impairments in functioning, treatment seeking, or the use of medic'ations to proVide relief . There is evidence 6f substantial individual variation amang women with premenstrual cornplaint --in regard ta l symptoms'experienced~ their timing and duration, as weIl as \\. the extent ta which they are perceived as problematic -- suggesting t~at PHS represents a heteroge~eo~s phenomenon .

So-'cial psychological inves~~goati~ns of PMS\u00b7have revealed that premenstruak symptom reports are subject to the influence of\" stereotyped beliefs, negative expectations, as wel,l as ota the demand, characteristics of the . i investigation. As a result, the validity and reliability of s\u00e9lf-reports of pr~menstrual symptoms --particularly retrospective reports --h~ve research'suggest that although perfectl~,normal women do complaig of PMS, there seems to be an i~creased risk of premenstrual complaint in less well-adjusted,individuals (e.g. those scoring ~~gh on neuroticism) , Investigations of' the relationship between PMS and psychiatrie disorder lend sorne support to the pe~sonality ; The pr~menstruat, and menstrual phases appear to , \" impose an additional str~ss on the functioning of .

Cognitive theories of depression, which ha\"ve domi~ated the field of depression research for the past -20 years, provide a potentially fruitful perspec'tive from which to examine {his ; relationship. Aaron Beek (1967, 1976) has delineated a cognitive model of depression which has substantially 1 influenced the\u00f4retical and empirical ipvestigations of depression. This model will be brief1y outlined qnd its patent ial to i llumi\"nate the cur rent' unders tandi ng of premenstrual mood changes, and their relationship to cli ni cal depress i on, wi Il be di scussed. Beck's Cognitive Theory of Depression Beck (1967, 1976) propose;d that disordered co\"gnitlve processi ng i s e xper i ence of depress,i-bn. Depresse~ people characteristically exhibit a \"cognitive triad\" of negative thoughts coneerning the self, the world; and the future. Depressive \"schemas\"\u00b7 or co~nltive structures whieh reflect the dysphor ic the ... ~ .~ 1 cognitive triad become prepotent during depression, influencing ~he processing ot information from the \" environment. The processes of selection, interpretation and evaluation of stimuli are a\"ll then applied to information in an idiosyncrati~ manner which yields su~port for the depressive cognitive structures. Beck proposed that the perv~sive content of 10ss, self-blame, ,low'self-esteem, deprivation, helplessness and 1 hopeless oess, character i5 t i Q!> of the thoughts of depressed individuals, reflect underlying cognitive schemata. These schemata are conceptualized as representing lia structure for screening, coding and \u00e8valuating the stimuli that impinge on the organism\" (Beck, 1967, p. 283). Under normal , \" ci rcumstances, 'a s,chema evoked by external st imuli is 'congruen t with i tO and \"the cogni t ion result i ng from the i nteract i on of the schema w i th the st imul i may be expected c to be a reasonably accurate representation of reali ty\" , (Beck, 1967, pp.285-286). In depression, however, j idiosyncratic schemata become activated and \" the resulting interpret~tions deviate from reality to a degree i _ corr~sponding with the incongruity of the schema to the stimulus situation\" (ibid.). A reciprocal re'lationship is posited between schemata and stimuli i'n the enviroment. As idiosyncratic schemata become more prevalent, they can be evoked, by less congruenf stimuli:. \" instead of a schema being selected tp fi t the external detai ls, the detai ls are / select i vel y ext ra\u00e7ted and modeled to fit the s chema\" (Beck, 65 , \\: 1 f 1 / - l ,.,. - 1967, p. 286). The more' that idiosyncratic schemat,a corne to dominate cognitive activity, the more out of touch with ~eality the depressive will be. .,. Th& activation of depressive schemata was purported to influence not on1y the cohtent but aiso the processing of inf,ormation from the envi,ronment. Beck, Rush, Shaw and Emery (l979)noutlined six logical errors in reasoning which depressed i ndi v iduais make and/ wh i ch serve to di sto rt reality in such a way as to.confirm the themes of the cognitive triad: arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, .. overgeneralization, magnification personaliza'tion anQ dichotomous tninking. Beck viewed o!l' disturbed cognitive processing as primary to depression, while the other affective, motivational, and behaviorai symptoms characteristic O\"t. depression were held to foilow from the way the' individual structured his reality. He did allow for an interaction between cognition and affect, . however, wherein depressive affect, st~ated by the activation of schemata, could further activate schemata and, Iead to increasingly depressive affect and distortions in rea 1 i ty. Beck was mor\u00e8 thorough in\u00b7outlining how depression p~~ceed~d' and was maintained than in explaining its origins ' li --for example where schemata came from and how they became , acti vated. He did state t,hat scemata r,epresent the ~end product of concepts about the self, world and future which are developed early in life. For examp1e, negati ve 66 1 . c c: j self!concepts \"derived'from personal experiences, other's key experience; as they gain strenth they become structuralized. Although such depressive schemata may remain dormant when the individual is not depressed, they are regarded as in~reasing the ~ulnerability of the individual, making him \"depression-prone\". According'to ~ Beck, ensues\u00b7when predisposed'individuals . (e.g: loss,' l:hwarted self-esteem, stress) which activate depressive schemata. Beck's' model ~as been extensively. t~st~d and there is strong support for 'the tenet that the thought content of depressives i~ more negatively toned than that of 'l nonde~ressed individuals: Such evidencei howe~er, does not 1 necessarily indicate that depressed individuals process information any differently than others. It may simply be an accurate reflection of the life experiences of depressed a people ~o are'typ~cally perceived as less soc~ally ~ o competent (Lewinsohn, Mischel, Chaplin & Barton\", <lgS0) 'and 1 Q who tend to provoke rejecting responses from others (Coyne\" 1976). .. Eviaence for the tenet that depressed individuals act~ally process information in a distorted manner has generally been ihferential and provided equivocal support. For example, studies \u00e0esigned to demonstrate distortions in 67 , i .

In summary, one Qf the fundamental tenets of Beck's 1 68 .:\" \" 1 1 , -\\ - -'\\ ( \\~ t;heory that depressed inqividuals process information in an idiosyncratic manner when depressed, --has rarely been . . ~ssessed directly~ Gener~l models of information processing are hel pful in con\u00e9eptua 1 i zi ng an approach to th i s resea rch issue. Information Proc~ssing Theory The ihformation processing models propo~ed by cognitive scientists have generally represented consciousness as a linear, sequential process of 1imited capacity, wherein a few bi ts of informa t i on are passed on from one stag~ to another. One of the fi rs t stages in the process i ng of information involves attentiol). Multiple s):imuli impinge on perceptual receptors, but only a 1 imi ted n umber of these can . -be att.ended to and subjected to further processlng. The pr\u00e7cess of sel\u00e8ctive attention has been conpeptualiz\u00e8d as a . . screening or filtering process during which information is analyzed for its significance to the organism (Broadbent, 1958; Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963). l , Kahneman (1973) a \u00b7comprehensi ~e iela become salient and are pr.ocessed more full y, i s lequi valent to the concept of selective attention. The attended units provide input to the ~xt stage wherein \"recogni tion uni ts\" are acti vated which match features of the input. These recognition units are ~omparable to the cognitive schemata which,Beck (1967) \\ : t 69 1 ( \\. , ' Q t, ~.- ref ers to ,d and are, 1 i kely represented in long-term memor y. It is at this stage tha't a match between incoming stjmuli . and schelllata results in a percept. It is during this stage that Beok suggests information processing 'in depressed indi~viduals goes awry, in that depressive schemata, which are 'prepot\u00eant, become act;ivated by inappropriate stimuli. Thus starts a cycle whereby the percept ion of stimuli becomes d istorted by the schemata; thus strengthing the '. ~ schemata and ensuring furtper distortion of information; s uch dis tort ions cont i nue i nto la ter-stages of pro cess ing 1 wherein -meani ngs and inter; preta t i Qns are also ass i gned to i'nformation in an idiosyncratic manner, resulting in lia / continuous, reciprocal causal relationship between- cognitive schemata and ai fect i ve str uctures, prod uci ng the downward r spiral often seen once a depressive episode becomes established\" (Beek, 1967# p.239). However, it ,is ponceivable that distqrtions in processing could occur at an even earlier stage: _what is \"\"\"--'-Joriginafly selected for attention could' be idiosyncratic, allowing tor the possibili ty that subsequent stages of) processing are performed accurately, but on biased input. '. ' Kahneman (1973) sugges ts that se lect i ve at tent ion i s gui ded by an individual's \"allocation P~iCy\" ~which can be formed on the basis of irnmediate need or reflE)!ct an endur ing disposition --either learned or innate :r-to foc us on . ~ certain aspects of incoming information and Ignore' athers. Might depressed individuals have idiosyncratic al1ocat~on 70 ,; c J c , { policies'?' Beek' s theory does incorporate the notion of ... selective attention, but almost as an aside. \"Selective abstraction\", listed as one of the processing errors which leads to distortions in the interpretation~of information, is defined as, ~focusing on a detail taken out of context, ignoring other more salient f~atures of the situation 'and conceptualizing the whole experience on the basis of this fragrne~\" (Beck et al., 1979, p .14). Accordi ng to Beck' s model, it,could also,be predicted that depressed individuals 1 would allocate'more attention to information consistent with their negative views of the self, the world and the future.l \\ Th\u00ea stage of selective attention has aroused little 1 ,interest withiQ ,depres~i~n research, in \u00e9o~parison to later 1 stages of processing such as the interpretation and recall of events. Recently, however, selective attention has been proposed as a potential bridge between cognition and emotion 1 /--- research (Nielsen & Sarason, 1981). Leaders in the stud'y of information processing have recognized the important impact that emotional and motivational factors play in interaction with cog'nitiol\\l (Norman, 1980). Broadbent (1977) suggested that \"hidden 'preat tent ive 'processes\" i ncl ud i ng moods, biases Q . ~ and motives, be given credence in cognitive theory. The 1 This prediction is also con;istent with other cognitive behaviora1 theories of depression. For example, Rehm (1977) posited \"selective attention to negative events\" 'as one of the self-control deficits which result in depression. Beck's model is considered to provide a more useful conceptual background for the current investigation mainly because of its greater focus on information processing. 71 ,1 / potentia1 heuristic value ot selective attention paradigms has been recognized and incorporaEed within investigations of emotional disorders, with productive resu1ts. Selective Attention -EIripirica,l Findings Anxiety Research Nielsen and Sarason (1981) employed a dichotic listening task with ..,shadowing, a commonly r'used measure in selecti~e attention paradigms, to investigate the influence of personality factors and emotional sti~uli on attention. Ondergraduate students were required to shadow (i.e. repeat aloud while lis ten i ng) neut raI words heard in one cha nnel or ear while ~jxt~res of rieutral and specifically-toned words were presented s imultaneously in the other channel. Sets of \" 1 stimulus tapes were constructed i~ which the wo~ds embedded in the ign~red channel were either sexua1ly explicit, , aggressive, related to test anxiety or to co11ege life; a control tape was constructed in which aIl words were neu tral. ' Er ror s made in sh9dowi ng were j udged to be indicative of a disruptive effect of the content of?the unattended channel on processing. SUbJects also cornpleted severa 1 psycho'log i c~l i nventor i es pr i dr to' and after' shadowing, including the Multiple Affect 'Adjecti,ve Checklist (MAACLi Zu\u00e7kerrnan & Lubin, 1965). Significant increas~s in shadowing errors were de~ected 1 only during the presentation of sexually explicit~ords in . . the unattended channel. The likelihood of detecting the sexual -words was posi ti vely related to subjects'\" state. 72 ,. , , \"., ,.,., anxiety scores. Over half of the subjects exposed to the sexually explicit words experienced conscious intrusions of these words; it was the subjects who experienced 4ntrusions who accounted for th.e i ncreases in shadow i ng e\\~r or.s.

The authors concluded that the previously observed vigilance had been due to the emotional relevance of the stimuli --i.e. their ,\" \", ! associations with fear --and not simply their greater 1 farniliarity to the subje~ts. -q Mathews and MacLeod (1986) found that subjects 73 c' ,1 . 1 1 1 , . \\ / 1 complaining of generalized anxiety states responded more slowly ori a reaction time\u00b7 task when threat eues as opposed 1 to non-threat eues were delivered in the unattended channel f of a dichotic listening task.' The reaetion times of nonanxious subjects were unaffected by the nature ,of. the l \" cues. The results suggested that in anxious subjects, process {ng res our ce s'Ina d been di spropor t iona tely di verted away from the task at hand when threat cues were present in \" . the unattended channel, even though the subjects apparently remained conseiously unaware of these eues.

The alpha values generated with the current _sample are very similar ta those -attained in the , . deveIopmental sample. Halbreich et al. ,(1982) aiso reported , a low alpha value (.61) for Scale 2. A one-way ANOVA was performed using-cycle phase durin~ which subjects responded.to the PAF as the grouping variable and Number as the depend,ent variable. \" 1 This analys~s yielded a significant effect, F(2,85) = 4.27, P < .01 . Post hoc '\" - 1 comparisons, as iIIustrated in Appendix J, ShOW\u00e9d that subjects who responded to the PAF during their~premenstrual phase achi\u00ebved significantly higher scores on Numb\u00e8r than did those respondin~ during either the postmenstrual,week or , .. any other week. The scores of subjects respond i ng dur i ng .the menstrual phase, ho~ever, did not differ from those of-\u00ad the other three groups.

Summary of Ftndings Full Sample (N~l30) The sarnple of women ~~~veyed with the retrospective version of the premenstruaf ~ssessment For~ can be described l as ~-relatively rnatuWgroup of' wornen, who are well-educated Although / and more than half of whom work ~utside the home. many of these women reported rnild premenstrual changes (PMC) in a variety of psychological, physical and b~haviora~ variables, fewertclassified their PMC as severe '(~16%) and even f~wer rated their PMe as se~erely disruptive of ~th~ir family, work or social life (1.6%). However, approximately 20% of women surveyed had sought\u00b7treatm\u00e8nt to relieve their pr~menstrual symptoms. The most frequently reported sympto~ clusters, endorsed at the greatest severity levels, involved general physical . --\"'\" discomfort, fatigue, signs of water retention,'anx~ety and depressive mood. Atypical depressive features represented the most common mood change reported premenstrually. < Endogenous~a~pr\u00eassive features were rarely endorsed by-the current sample. ' A~ examination of the individual items rnost frequently endorsed as Most severe by th\u00e9 full sarnple yielded a mixture of dys~ric ~ood descriptors (e.g. irritability, sadness, anxietY~d physical syrnptoms (e.g. fatigue, breast ~ swelling, bl~ating, heidaCheS), with approximately one-third of the sample indicating that th~~e items represented 114 \" c . '-;0 c 1 moderate to extreme changes from their nonpremenstruai state. \u00b7-A comparison betw\u00e9en the data derived from the cur.rent 1 s\u00e2mple and tha~ derived from the developmental sample of Halbreich et are (1982), which was somewhat younger, ~'7'{ revealed Many commonalities both in terms of the typological categories and the individua~ items endorsed. Two signs of water r\u00e9tention (breast sw\u00e9lling and bloating), as weIl as sadness and weepiness, were somewhat more prevalent in the developmental sample. A core group of symptoms, however, was common to both samples and included fatigue, ir~itability, sadness, and water retention. Age was found to be negatively related to the s~verity of overall premenstrual complaint,.and particularly to'the experienc'e of certain psychological changes. Validity and reliability. The PAF was demonstrated to , , ') be internally consistent: indices derived from individual item ratLngs showed high agree-ment with more global '\" assessments of PMe and were highly related to relevant behavioral tendencies (e.g. treatment seeking). As weIl, < the internaI consistency of each of the 18 unipolar summary scales was \u00e7emonstrated to,be very high with the ~xc~ption of the Bcale representing endogenous depressive features. ( The cycle phase during which subjects an~wered the PAF was found to affect their symptoms ratings -~osing a challenge to the reliability of the instrument. Subjects .who,responded to the retrospective PAF in the premenstrual , 115 \\ ~ a ! .' t phase tended to report higher levels of complaint on the - majority of unipolar summary s~ales.\u00b7 The experience of severe dysmenorrhea was found to be related to an increased severity of PMC in general, but this was shown to be due mainly to elevations in certain physical symptom scales. PMD versus Control Group ~ The PAF responses of the two component subgr~ups which made up the contrbl group (i.e. physical ~hanges vs. no changes premenstrually) were found to be similar enough to warrant treating them as one r\u00e8latively homogeneous control group --particularly'with regard'to their lack of psychological complaint. PMD and control subjects failed to differ in any of the demographic variables studied with the exception that a higher proportion of contraIs were homemakers: The two ~ s~bject groups were also indistingu~shable with regard to , most of the menstr~al cycle characteristics surveyed. PMD ~ subjects were, however, more likely ta report severe, dysmenorrhea accompanyin~menses than were controls. As might be expected, control subjects were less likely than PMD subjects to report severe levels of PMC, to regard their \\ PMC as di~uPtive, or to seek treatment for their PMe. , ! h The PAF profile.of PHD subjects suggested a multidimensional symptom experience. Most subjects who complained of 'premenstrual de~~essive phanges also reported 1 general physical discomfort, water retention,' fatigue and 116 c \\ c impai.rme\u00b7rits \\d social functioning. The unipolar summary , scores of the control group were generally le$s than half of .those of the PMO group --even for scales representing phys i cal compla i nt. ,As, weIl, th~ order of scales, ranked according to severity level, differed between,groups suggesting qualitative as weli as quantitative differences --, in their respective' experience premenstrual.lY. An , , examination of the highest mean individual items' ~cores obtained by each group supports this observation. The PMD group reported_predorninantly psychological sympeoms, while '0 .... \\ controls reported mainly physical symptoms. Only three items were common to both groups, apparently reflecting quantitative differences between PMD and controi subjects: \u00e0ecreased energy and fatigue, irritability and a tendency to quarrel. Interpretation of Findings , The'retrospective survey of premenstrual cbanges (PMC) suggested that many of the 3~-45 year old women sampled dete\u00e8ted at least mild changes in either their psychological, physical or b\u00e8haviora1 functioning, premenstrually._ The fact that close to 8~% of those surveyed reported tha:t such changes had li ttle impact on -their lives suggests that for the most part, mild PMC can bel , ~egarded as a normal facet of a woman's experience dur\u00efng \\ her re~roductive years. Less than 2% of the samp1e found tneir PMe to be incapacitating. This figure,is similar to the estimate for r 117 \\ :: o () \\ severe or disabling PMe found by Andersch in a.Swedish epidemi 0 log i cal stud y (c i ted in Bancrof t &' Backst rom, l~ 85) and suggests that th~ incidence of PMS as a disabling disorder,_although relativeiy'rare, i5 no means --; inconsequential. Between.the two jus~ m~ntioned, however, lie a proportion of women (16-20%) who report their PMC to be severe and,moderately disruptive of their lives, and who have 50ught treatment for their symptoms. Although ,'the incidence of severe PMC in the, current sample i5 somew~at higher than that reported in prior 5urvels (e.g. 10% -Andersch) there\u00b7appears to be a substaneial whom PMe --whi1e n~t disabling --still repres~nts a serious health concerne The most common PMe experienced by the sample as a ~hole involved a mixture of psychological\\and ph~sical symptoms, similar to the central-features of PMS commonly reported in the lit~rature (i.e~ dysphorie mood, fatigue, water retention and physical discomfo~t). Themost commonly reported category.of mood change involved atypical depressive_features (i.e. hypersomnia, mood swings, increased appet i te) \" which suppor ts the fi nd i ngs of Halbreich et a1. (1983). If severity of symptom report ls , taken into accoun~, however, the anxiety Bcale (i.e.' anxiety, restlessness, physical agitation, stress) was somewhat more prominent. p In general, the current survey produced findings highly comparable to those of the developmenta\"l sample of Halbreich 1.18 , , . c , et al. (1982), suggesting that the PAF has high content\" validity across samples of ~orma1 women. The only notable discrepancy was the somewhat lower report of signs of water retention\\and depression in'the current sample. Althoug~ a lack of information concerning the comparability of these ,samples precludes drawing any inferences about the observed discrepancies, this finding raises interesting questions concerning the relationship between age and premenstrual symptom e_xper ie_nce. More than half of the developmental sample consisted of women whose ages fell below the lower limit of -the-age range for the current sample (i.e. 30 years). There have been seve~al reports in the literature \u00b7that the peak.p~riod for premenstrual difficulties falls in late thirties (Gough, 1975; Kramp, 1968~ MOos, 1969). The correlation between age and an index of overall tseveri~y of PMe i~ the current sample ~as negative~ ~~~ -suggesting that PMe declin\u00e9 in severity with increasing age in an older sample. The possibility ex.ists that certain, PMe are age related, or related to sorne other variable ~hat r covaries with age (e.9. parity) and investigations designed to directly investigate thi~ relationship a~e n~eded. Although reliabilitY,is challenged by ~ the cycle phase during wh~ch the PAF was completed was - r~lated to the severiti of ~ymptom complaint. Subjects' fl. asked to rate the general level of changes eperienced during the pre~enstrual phase of their past three menstrual cycles 119 .-1 produced higher-ratings if ~~y-answered during their o ~ 1. sUbjecf\u00e8 may report more accurate sev~rity ratings during the pr~menstrual phase because of the immediacy of their experience or they may inf1ate th~ir symptom report for -much the same reason ... These alternatives will be , \" 1 C\"., , ad4ressed further in Part II~, ; w'l-,7' i ve < rep.,fft , 0 2. The PAF definitions for the premenstrual, menstrua1 and intermenstrual phases are aIl flexible, while on1y the postmenstrual phase is clearly stipulated to he a week in l\u00ebngth., That is;' wom~,n'-may def~ne their own premenstrual 1 phase a~ 1 or 3 _ or ,14 days. The foll~wing two findings are , suggestive, although they both represent ooly trends in the , data: (a) P.MDJ subjects report a somewhat earlier onset of _..... . symptoms than co'ntrols (see Table 8, p. 110a) qnd (b) women reporting PMD were somewhat more likely to ha~e answe~ed\u00b7the o PAF thei} premenstrual phase (see , 'Therefore, ,7\"matic women may have longer pre'menstrual phases, increasing the odds that more symptomatic women will . - answer the\" PAF premens ~rua.ll y. The _i nc..r.,eased sever i ty_ of reporting may therefore be an accuiate reflection of ~ymptom expeiience but be c9nfounded by the menstrual cycle 199istics of the sample surveyed.

An investigation of the re1ationship between dysmenorrhea and PMC indicated that,. contrary .t<? p.a1ton's (1964) ~la i m, these two phenomena do co-occur. Of those subjects reporti n9 moder\u00eb!~e or severe PMC \\P, physiological in nature, suggesti~g that dysmenorrh~a adds an increased of physica1 discomfort to PMC. \" . 'R' ..

The nature of this relationshi iS,1 as yet, unclear but it has b\u00e8e!l postulated -that premenstrual depression may signal a,vulnerability for the development of affective illness. Descl:iptions of the dsyphoric or depressive mood associated with the premenstrual phase closely resemble the subjective feeling state which typica11y occurs ln clinical depressive illness. The subjective fee1irg component, however, is only one aspect of the comPlel multldimensional. phenomenct,n' of clInical depression (Plutchlk, 1980). Features typically assoeiated with depressive illness \" inc.lude dlsturbances ln sleep and appetite, m'otivational defieits, hypochondriasis, and excessive guilt \u00e0nd self-reproach \" (Weckowicz et al., 1967). Furthermore, there are no symptoms of depression which are unique to this condition; , features resembling depression o~cur in patients diagnosed . \" ~ with schizophrenie (Carroll, 1972) and anxiety disorders (Me-ndels, Weinstein, & Cochrane, '1972). Depressive symptoms are also associated with certain mectllcal disorders (e.g. thyroid dysfunction) and appear as side effets of certain medications (e.g. hypertension medication). 124 c' f \" C ~J '. f -- \" - Although a concordance has b\u00e8\u00ebn established between the experience of premenstrual depression and current or past episodes of clinica1 depression, and the two phenomena apparent1y share a common subjective mood component, few investigations haye assessed their relationship with respect , 'to other sequellae of depression: Clinical experience with premenstrua11y depressed women sugg~sts that a cognitive . approach to depression may have relevance for premenstrual affective changes. The marked onset of negative cognitions in the premenstrua1~phase and their apparent dissipation -following menses seems particular1y amenab1e to explanation by Beck's cognitive theory of depression. Beck (1967, 1976) posits that the symptoms of depression follow from the act4vation of depressive schemata which structure the individual's perception of her world. Information is ~hen proc~ssed in an idiosyneratic manner to yie1d support for the negative views the individual hold about the self, the world and the future. 'A prediction derived from,Beck's . model is that depressed individu~ls attend to information in a selective manner --that is, in a manner consistent with their negative outlook. , ' . Information processing theory states that attention is guided by an individual's allocation polieies, which may reflect either immediate needs or enduring dispositions to focus on certain\u00b7 aspects 2f information and i9nore others. , Recent empirical findings within selectiv~ attention re~~arch_suggest that affective disorders are associated 125 \" \\ with idiosyncratic allocation policies. c .' The demonstration of idiosyncratic information processing in premenstrually depressed women would provide preliminary evidence that this phenomenon shares a cognitive component with clinical depression, in addition to the . ) recognize~ phen~menological c.Q.mponent (i.e. feeling of idiosyncratic information processing in prernenstrual depression would, by extension, suggest a pot~ntial cognitive ~ulnerabitity factor'for the development ~f depressive i11ness. The Current Investigation The current investigation ~~ designed to assess ~he co-occurrence of depression with the premenstrual phase of the rnenstrual cycle aS'indicated by both self-report and behavioral indices. The administration of standardlzed inventories of depression WIll allo~ for an dssessment of the degree of the depres~ion experienced premenstrually relative to available norms. The dlChotic shadowing task will provide a behavioral index of dysphor~c attentional -bias, which i5 considered to be a concomitant of depression. The selective attention findings, in tandem with the depression inventory dati, are expected to elucidate the nature of the r~lationship between premenstrual depr~s81on an1 affective illness an~ the, potential relevance of a cog,litive?lvulnerabilfty factor in premen.truai depress)on. Women reporting premenstrual cha'nges premenstrually (control.' 126 ( were asked' to of a number of co~monl.y reported premenstrual symptoms d'uring the course of one complete menstrual cycle. During this same cycle, they took part in two test sessions --one premenstrually and one postmenstrually --each of which involved the administration v of two standardized measures of depression as well.as a ~!chotic shadowing task. Within the dichotic shadowing task, the commission of relatively more errors while \" shadowing in the presence of dysphorie distraction as compared to n~n-dysphoric distraction is indicative of an attentional bias for dysphorically-toned material.

AlI target stimuli are 'presented in Appendix T. ,/ . 137 , ,.... ./ 1) -\u00b7' stimulus Tape Organi.ation. The stiffiulus tapes used in the diehotie task are eaeh composed of 10 experimental '~ stimulus pairs: ten .targets reeorded on one channel, in , tandem with ten distracters on the other channel, Qf a stereo audio cassette tape,. The 10 t-arg\u00eat stimuli are alternately paired with dysphorie and non-dysphorie distraeters (5 of eaeh). Both members of eaeh pair are approximately one minute'in length and are separated from . ~ other pairs by a 10 second interstimulus interval. A,tone signaIs the onset of each .whi ch preeeeds i ts mutual distraeter by about 10 words. AlI target and distraeter stimuli are ~eeorded at equal amplitudes and rate of speech in the same male voiee. Two equivalently con6~ructed tapes containing different stimulus content (i.e. two sets of 10 stimulus pairs) are available so that subjects can be tested twiee with limited practiee effeets. These tapes are designated Tape A and Tape B of Series X. A duplicate set of these two tapes was aiso eonstrueted Tapes A and ~ of Series Y --in which eaeh target stimulus which was paired with a dsyphoric distraeter in Series X is paired with a non-dysphori~ distracter in Series Y. Similarfy, eaeh target stimulus wh}ch was paired with a non-d~sphoric distraeter in Series X is paired with a dysphorie distracter in Sertes Y. In addition, the order in whieh-targets and distracters, oceur wa~ aitered 50 that the order of presentat~on of stimuli on Series y,differs from that on Series X. FinaI1y, ~eries X \" 138 ( \"- ( begins with a non-dysphorie distraction trial and Series Y begins with a dsyphor;ic distraction,~ial. Further details \"'\" concerning the organization and techni~chaxacteristics of stimulus tapes can be found in Appendix Q. The purpose of constructing two differeht stimulus series was to determine the effects of type of distraction on shadowing performanc~, unconfounded by target characteristics or by potential interactive effects of , \u00b7particular targets and distracters. Half of the subjects in each experimental group (PMD and controls) will be randomly assigned to Series X and Y, so that any differential influence due to particular ~a~get/type of distraction /' pairing or order of. presentation of stimuli, will be equated across experimental groups. Additionally, half of the' subjects in each group will receive Part A premenstrually and ~t B postmenstually, while the other half will receive Part \\ premenstrually and Part A postmenstrually. This i5 expected to control for the possibility that parti~ular target/dist~acter pairings might interact with menstrual cycl~ phase in sorne undetermined manner. -, A third tape set, consisting of three sets of stimulus pairs, aIl wieh non-dysphorie distraction, was constructed to provide two practice trials and a.baseline measure of shadowing. Considerable effort was made by Shenker (1980) to establish the content validity Qf the stimuli he developed . (s~e Appendix Pl, andothe significant o~tcome of his study 139 ( lends support to their differential salience for depressed ~and subj~cts. Additional content validation is' 'provided by a psychopharmacologic\u00e2l study (Young et al., 1985), which employed the same distracter stimuli in tandem with a probfreading task. In this study normal subjects exposed to tryptophan depletion committed more proofreading errors in the presence of ~ysphoiic distraction than I\u00ceJ' non-dysphorie distraction, while con~rols did not. The implication was that the negative mood ~tate induced by ~ tryptophan depletion was accompanied by a selective attention bias for dysphoric.stimuli. Procedure As men\u00d9\u00f4ned E-reviously, PMD and control subjects ~ere selected for participation in the study on the basis of their retrospective PAF respon~es.

Two BOl forms were available in subjects' diary packages. This step /\"1 was taken to guard against a possible mood induction effect, consequent to completing the BOl, that might influence subjects' dichotic shadowing performance. The BOl contains rather powerful negative descriptors which could stimulate \\ dysphorie thoughts ~nd reactions. As weIl, the dichatic shadowing task could potent1ally induce dysphoric reactions, depending on the degree to which the dysphorie distracters were processed. The MAACL, however, whi ch conta ins 'both positive and negative mood adjectives, was judged as , representing a m1lder, less intrusive measure than the BOl. -\"\\ For these reasons, then;, the BOl was completed the evening prior to testing, the -MAACL was administered first during the test session, and the dichotic listening task was administered last.

The \"extra tape ~ec~rder provided a copy of . aIl shadowing performances as a preeautionary measure. The stimulus tapes to be administered, as weIl as the eay in which target stimuli would be delivered, was predetermined by a ~rocess of rando~ assignment.

Ear of target presentation was counterbalaqced ta control for the weIl documented right ear effect; for most people, shadowing performance for ~erbal material pres~nted t~ the right ear tends to be better than for similar material presented to the left ear (Neisser, 1976). since ear of target presentation do es not change for individual subjeets, however, it should effect only overa11 shadowing performance and not the d~ta relevant to the hypotheses,under inve~tigation --i.e. the difference between :\" ..

After scbjects had completed the MAACL, the fol10wing instructions were given for the dichotic listening task: \"Let me explain what the task is.

Firstly, the depression reported by PMD subjeets-might simply represent sadness, dsyphoria or negative affect as ~pposed to actual depression (i~e. mood state vs syndrome). A dysphorie attentional bias May be assoeiated with depressive, illness but not with a depressive mood state.

The findings of this _ \\ study, conducted with eo11ege students labelled depressed on the basis of BOl scores, May dot be generalizable to . the synd-rome o'f depress i on. Ea ves and Rush (1984), assessed the dysfunctional attitudes (OAS, Weissman & 1 Y Beek), 1978) of -' , remitted depress{ves and controls.' Although Eaves and Rush noted a significant decline in the dysfunctional \" . attititudes of remitted depressives, they still 171 L , .. . ~ demonstrated signlficantly elevated scores on the DAS relative to controls.

It must be noted that there is little evidence to support the vali~ity of premenstrual depressiQn as ~ syndrome per se. Aithough many studies ha~e detected the occurrence of depressive by dep,ression which claim that depressive syndromes occur premer:tstrual\u00b7ly-which ful:fill aIl but the duration 1 ~ and impaiqnent criteria of clinical depressiori. T\u00b7bis_ observation, however, doesn't adequately acknowledg\u00e8 the \" many other symptoms which co-occur with depressive mood preme~strually (see Part III) or the f~ct that d~ration and impairment criteria represent critical (i.e. definitional) components of clinical depression.

This notion derives from recent , evidence suggesting that the cognitive sequellae of , depression may be 1ess prGnounced in endogenous dep~essions. Zimmerman and Coryell (1986) investigated ~ r -the relationship between scores on the Dysfunctionat Attitude ~,ca1es (OAS) (We~ssman & Beek, 1978) --an associated 'with depression --and endogen?us depression. Endogenous depression was determined on the' basis of abnornra1 . response to the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) .. Endogenous depressives scored significantly lower on the DAS than did nonendogenous depressives, suggesting that cognitive factors may be 1ess rel\u00e8vant for depressions with. clear biologi\u00ebal correlates (e.g. response to antidepressants and ECT) or biological abnormalities (response, to DST, cortisol hypersecretion). Has\"kett et L\u00b7al. (1984) failed to find abnorma,l DST results in subje~ts complaining of ~evere premenstrual teps ion, suggesting t~at premenstrual depression is not a form of endogenous depression, but it does not follo~ that premenstrual depression is therefore psychologically based (e.g. as in neurotic depression)\" Hormonal correlates may yet be identified which contribute to the dysphorie mood women e'xperi~nce premenstrually .

In a study of women assessed on six occasions, from the second tri~ster of pregnancy to 6 months postpartum, - Ohara'and c\\lleagues found that somatic ~DI ~tems (i.e. items 15-21) were consistently rated higher than cognitive/affective items (i.e. items 1-14).

Furth,ermore, the d ichoti c shadowi~g paradigm allowed for an isolated assessment of one of the earliest stages of 'informa~ processing --the stage of \"figuraI processes, expe.ri\u00b7mental demand, or self-presentational style. Accor~ing to Beck's theory, the current findings suggest that depressive cogbitive schemata were activated , in the INTD subjects but neither in the PMD nor the \" control subjects. A conclusion consistent with Beck's . theory would be that the.PMD and control subjects were - simply not depressed. If the PMD group actually were depressed, this creates a problem in interpr~tation, for- Beck posits not only that active depressive schemata and depressive affect ar~ concomitant, but that the-, ., affect ive, physi ologi\\cal and mot i vational symptoms of depression follow from the activation of depressive schemata. H~nce if the ~chemata are active, the depressive symptoms should ensue, and if the sympt~ms are, present, active schmata are implied. 177 i' \" .-.. c. _ ,r<. . 1 .\" - 1,\" ::..r .

This \" methodological imperative stems from research revealing marked discrepancies between subjects' \"retrospective a.nd prospective Rubinow et al., 1985). In general, subjects have been found eith\u00e9r to overestimate their symptom s:ve~t~ or to attribute to, the premenstrual phase symptoms that are actually more widespread. Within the CUIrent investiga'tion, darly ratings ,serv\u00e9d two purposes. While they were employed as a 8creening (\" device to they were a1so consideied to provide the most unbiased picture of wh~t women dctuall.y experience premenstrua-lly. Granted, dally ratings suffer the limitations inherent in any self-report measure1 it cou'd be argued, 'for example, that they are equally vulnerable \"to the influence of stereotypes and demand characteristics. However, s,ince no biological, market ha. been identi f ied for premenstrual .ymptoms and many are not- daily ratings method ~urrently available to establish wome~s pubjective prernenstrual experience. The fact that . , si~n}ficant reductions occur in the percentages of women reporting prernenstrual changes on daily ratings as compared to their retrospective report suggests that daily ratings do considerably irnprove the validity and reliability of . prernenstrual sympt.om reporting. . { One of the major issues within the field of prernenstrual research is whether subtypes of premenstrual , change exist and how they f ' & Backstrom, 1985; Moos, 1986). Abraham (1980) the basis of, \"clinical obseri\u00e0.tion\" delineated four subtypes of PHS, based on core symptoms of depression, anxiety, water retention and food cravings accompanied by autonomic , symptoms. Hargrove and Abraham (1982) reported that the \\ . , ~ . depression subgroup was the least commonly en\u00e8orsed by a sample of 1395 w~men. Cullberg (1972) drew a distinction between women with and without premenstrua1 irritability on the basis of their differentia1 response ta hormonal preparations. He noted that the presenc~ o~ premenstrual \"'1\" depression was not responSiivity. The-Premenstrual Asse\"ssment Form (\"PAF) of / \" Ha1breich et al. (1982) allows for the differentiation o\u00ce 18 ~ categories of premenstr~al change. Ha1breich, Endicotb and Nee (1983), in contrast t~Abraham, report PAF results indicating- ~at depression is one 185 , endo~sed subtypes of premenstrual the PAF sugg~st that there i~ a considerable degree of overlap between the 18 categories of premenstrual change~ but questions remain regarding how these numerous categories may combine to tepresent various subtypes of \" change. There remains a need for the delineation of consistent homogeneous subtypes of premenstrual change r particularly those derived from subjects' prospective ratings of symptom experience . , Relevant Research There was a tendency for earlier investigations which employed daily ~atings to study a few select sy~ptci~s -- , often p~y~hological in nature --and to analyse the data of the sample studied as one grbup. Such studies generally -' drew conclusi ons support ing ei,th\u00e8r the presence (Backstrom, . - Boyle & Baird, 1981; Sanders, Warner, Backstrom & Bancroft, 1983) or the absence (Abplanalp et al., 1979; Parlee, 1982) of signifJcant fluctuations in particular variables across the menstrual cyc~e. However, several simiiar studies which found no significant cyc1ic fluctuations in group data reported the presence of high va'r iabi li ty w i th in the! r samples. (Schilling, 1981; Swandby, 1981>. Although group means did not signifi\u00e7antly vary across phases, a small nu~ber of subjects in each study did experience \"intense rea~tion patterns of clinical sig~ificance~' premenatrually (Schilling, 1981, p. 90), suggesting that the mean group comparison method waB unBuitable for the a., ment of 186 \\ \" \" menstrual cycle fluctuations in heterogeneous samaIes.\u00b7 In-recogniti~n of t~e heterogeneity inherent 'in the , Prem~nstrua1 Assessment Form (PAF) e1icit reports of numerous symptoms an~ provide for individua1ized definitions , . of cycle phase. Although this high1y specialized approach may be an advantqge in c1inica1 settings, it renders 'the comparison of dai1y data across subjects som~thin9'of a logistic nightmare. Variations in the length of se1f-defined cycle ph~ses (e.g. premenstrua1 phase_can vary from 1 to 14 days) must be dea1t with. Decisions must be Q made as to which of the 95_PAF items shou1d be rated prospectiv~ly -a.consistent group oI items for everyone or , select items tai10red to the individtial experience of each subject? The on1y pub1ished study to date whic~ has undertaken . the analysis of daily ratings based on numerous' symptoms, rated on an ordinal sca1e, and with a relative1y large sample of women, was conducted by Endicott and colleagues . (1986). Sixt y-four women, Who reported either moderate on a 2e-item, 6-poi~t rating form over the course of one menstrual cycle. The foc,us of the analysis was on the 1 degree of change evident_between the premenstrual and postmenstru\u00e9ll phases -.-operationa11y def ined as the mean. ratings of the 3 mos~vere days within the 5 days .' 187 \" , premenstrually and the mean ratings -of the 5 days postmenstrually. Fact~r analyses were conducted with the , , change scores for -each of the f0 i tei\"l\\S for the group of 64 women. Five diffelent dimensions of premenstrual change were identified: dysphorie mood, physical discomfort, 10. energy, consumption, and an item -;including increased activity, sexual interest and alcohol use. The first fou~ factors were highly correlated wit'h one another . Of' \" relevance to the CUlrent i nves t iga t ion i s tha tas i ng le . factor emerged for dysphouric mood, suggesting that the various m06d changes reported premenstrually covary. -The ~orementioned factor analytic findings are . representative of only a po~tion of the original 100 subjects who had compl eted da il Y rat i ngs. Subjects had been . initially screened to eliminate thoS\u00e8 whose dai1y ratings \" indicated more pervasive dysphorie changes ('n-29). Since one of the major questions of the current' investigation ia the rela'ti onship between premenstrual depressi on and more persistent depression, the prospective aymptom profile of subjects with more pervasive depression is~~qua11y of i nterest. The genera 1 phenomenolog y of pr emens t rua 1 changes as indicated by daily ratings; \"and the potential existence , of homogeneous subtypes of change represents a secondary fo~us of inquiry.

As out1ined \u00ce\"fl Part II (p. 130), 55 subjects agreed to keep dai1y ratings for one'\u00b7 complete cycle, whereas only 48 subjects successfully completed the two experimenta1 test sessJons. AII,55 subjects who completed daily ratings are represented herein: (a) 32 PMD subjects who had reported m~or depressive syndrome premenstrually and (b) 23 control s,ubjects who had x~ported either no changes or only physJca1 changes pr\u00e9mens trua Il y. MeasureS The format of the daily diary forms, as previously described' in Part II (p. ,131/1), was such that each,\u00b7day's ratings ,tepresented a single page. Twenty items were\u00b7, -included which represented a range of psychological, physical and behaviora1 changes commonly rep~rted . , premenstrua11y. The items se1ected reflected the basic 189 r , \\ a .1 (\\ .-content of Many of the 18 unipo1ar summary scales. Items were rated on a,scale from l to 6 (not at aIl to extre~e). An item concerning life events --both stressful or uplifting --was' inc1uded to detect potentia1 on subjects 1 ratings. An examp1e of ttle dai ly o rating form is disp1ayed 1n Appendix M. Data Ana1ysis The criterion used to signlfy a ~eaningful degree of premenstr~al change was a 30% increase in premenstrua1 ratings as compared to postmenstrua1 ratings (as in Endicott & Halbreich, 1982 and Rubinow'et al., 1984),. The premenstrual phase was defined as the five days prior to the onset of menses whi1& the postmenstrual phase included the five da ys fo11o~ing the cessation of menses. These days are considered to represent th~ MOst c1ear1y encapsulated report of symptomatic and asymptomatic (Backstrom et al., 1983). B\",ecause of the varlabil~ty in timing of premenstrual changes, an appr.oach suggested by , \\ Endicott et al. (1986) was adopted to ensure a more sensitive contrast between pre~ and postmenstrua1 ratings: the Mean rating of the highest 3 consecutive days during the 5 premenstrual days was compared with t~e Mean rating of the 5 postmenstruaf days~ , ' Equa1ly~important.was the confirmation of the absence of ~ignificant symptom peaks (i.e. ratings of 4, 5, or 6) during the -remainder of the cycle, unless they could be 198 \\ \\ T . ' i' , 13' attributed to a rep,orted stressful event The remainder '* of the cycle was operationally defined as days other than the 10 pre-and postmenstrual days, with the exception of 1 days of menstrual b1eeding. The -decision ta .exclude, days of m~nstrual bleeding from the presumed a7mptomatic phase'was based of menses (Endicott et al., 1986). For each subject, then, the monthly ratings for each of 29 items was considered in turn to determine whether or not \" the item refl'ected significant premenstrual change. The confirmation process proceeded in the following manner . Firstly, the rnean of the 3 highest consecutive premenstrual ~ays was compared with the Mean of the 5 days postmenstrual , 1 and secondly, the remainder of the cycle was examined for sympto~ peaks. Five outcomes were possible: 1. premenstrual change on an item was nonexistent oi minor (i.e. < 30%) and it showed no significant.peaks during the remainder of the cycle that could not be attributed to a reported stressor~ the item was not confirmed. 2. A 30%' premenstrual il'!crease was detected and the item showed no other significant peaks during the remaiQder of the cycle; the item was confirmed. \\ 12 Although the potential influence of reported stessors required 4 a subjective judgement by E, the majority of tqe items reported were fairly-serious and their effects not unexpected (e.g. loss of job, death of \\relative, illness or operation). An item concerning the influence of uplifting eNents on subjects' ratings was provided, bu t i t ~as ra rel y endorsed. \"Therefore, only the report of stressful events was taken into a\u00e7count as a potential modifier of syrnptom ratings. ) o. / .1 o , \\ .&... 1 inciease was detected and addi~ional signiflcant peaks were present, but plausible stressors were reported close in time tO the peak; the item was confirmed. , . 4.

The comparison of retrosp~ctively and prospectiyely determined symptom classifications suggests that the Premenstrual Assessment Form (PAin ,is highly effective in 1 identifying both asymptomatic subjects and those who experience physical symptoms alone. The tetrospective report oI these two ~ategories of subjects were very likely, toI be confir.med by their daily fatings.

Similar s~bjects, that i8 women with more widespread psychological symptoms, have been noted in rnany investigations of PHS (Clare, 1983; ch'ronically depress to . .. the premenstrual phase when it i8 actually more widespread. The'propensityof mOlie chronically depressed women to . show up wi th complaints of premen\u00e2trual, investigations and in treatment clinics repr.esents t an enigma. The daily ratings oi the subgroup with pervas}ve depr ession 'i ndi cated tha t thei\"r retrosp\u00e9ct ive reports of c sympt~ms other than depressive mood were aiso unreliable and unl'i kely to be conf i rmed.

The relative perceived severity and inconsist,ency in their PMC may suggest that this subgr-oup ences i ntermi t tent depre,s t the month which coincides witp the premenstruai phase (by chance) o~ten enough for an \u00ealssociation t-o be noted.

Several questions were raised in the discussion section of Part l for which the curreQt results have relevance. A \" --~')negative correlation was noted between age and the ~e of tha t the 5 ubgroup .. / PMe reported. The current results suggest with more pervasive depression represented the younge~ ~ subjects within the sample. Since this subgroup represented \u00b739% of the original PMD group, and tended to report relatively severe PMe, the negative correlation of symptotn , report with age could be partlally attributed to ~heir influence. The negative correlation with age, then, may not be representbtive of confirmed premenstrua<l suffers. An issue related to age'is that of parlty. An interesting t r end i n the cu r r e n t da t a wa s th a t the pre me n s t rua l depression SUbgrour. had the fewest childeen yet they were not the youngest sibgrOup. Although there have been clinical reports 't~at PMS begins or worsens following 1 , . pregnaocy (Green & IDalton, 1953), survey studies have not , substantiated this claim (Reid, 1985). The relationship between 1ge, par i ty and conf\u00b7i rmed prernens t rual ch.{nges has potentially important implications'~nd requires further 1 investigation.

An examination of o \\ the prospectively derived sUbgroups,revealed that relativeli 'more subjects ~ responded premenstrually derived front the premenstrual depression subgroup and the pervasive de~ress ion subgroup. The s igni fi cance of respond i ng premenstrually, then, may vary according to sorne ingex of adjustment. For subjects who actually had premenstrual , depressive mood change, cycle phase of response may have had little impact or increased. the accuracy of their recall, \" whereas for subj~cts with more pervasive depression, responding during the premenstrual phase may have increased their tendency to attribute depressive mood to the menstrual cycle. 10 conclude, little evidence was found to support the , validity of premenstrual depression as a distinct and ..... separate subtype of PMe.

These - que;tions will be reiterater and addressed in llght findings generated in the ~rent investigation~ of the 1. Does prernenstrual depresslon represent a subtype of prernenstrual change in the . complete absence of psychopathology? 2. Do premenstrual depression points on the continuum, differing- only in severity and du~atlon of symptorns? 3. Are women who experience premenstrual depresslon , \" vulnerable or affective illnes's? The cutrent no support of premenstrual depression as a dlstinct subtype of The PMD subjects studied , did fulfill PAF crit-eria for Major Depressive Syndrome on , the basis of retrospectlVe report. The symptom prof i le8 generated retrospectively suggested that PMD subjects l' experienced a multidimensional sympto~ picture -. but it apreared that depression might represent their predominant comp1aint. Subsequent examination of the prospective , olt symptom profiles of confirmed PMO subjects, however, revealed that their 8~mptom picture was indeed 285 / \u00b7 \" < ) c multid\u00eemensional and although depressive mood was a prominent complaint, it did not stand out as the predominant feature --ei ther afcord ~ng to i rmed subjects endorsin~t or to the relative severity of sympt~m rating~. Equally prominent in th\u00e9 prospective report of conf i rmed PMD subjects were i rr i tabi li ty, ,anxiety, decre'ased energy, water retention and general malaise. Dysmenorrhea appeared to be a freq~ent additional complaint in this group. The current data were generated with a volunteer sample, however, and may not b~ representative of women with more severe P~D complaint. Profile analyses of the prospective report of confirmed samples of sevare sufferers i~' are clearly called for to establish the phenomenology of / premenstrual complaint and the utility of qelineating subtypes of premenstrual change. The cuirent results address the issue of concomitant . psychopathology only indirectly. The predominance of depressive symptoms in the original retrospective ,PAF profiles may be partially attributable to the influence of . the INTD group --who reported noncyclic depression' during the cycle of studY. It is possible that INTD subjects do have cycles wherein their report of premenstrual depression would be confirmed; an extended ~ourse of daily rarlng~ would be ,necessary to determine the course of their symptoms and their relationship to the m~nstrual cycle. It would appear, however, f rom the cnrrent fi ndings, . tha t this 296 subgroup of women is not completely free of affective ~ pathology (perhaps dysthymic disorder?). They demonstrated mildly elevated depression during both pre-and ) postmenstrual test phases and exhibited an attentionsl biss hypothesized to co-occur with depression. However, since 1 clinical interviews were not conduct~, the presence of affective pathology in this subgroup cannot be assumed. Whether there would be any utility in 1abe11ng such a group (if they indee~ exist) as premenstrual1y depressed 15 an empirical question. Glick (1985J proposes that there may be sorne utility in conceptualizing PMS as armodel that includes both premenstrual exacerbations of psychiatrie illness and PMS without concomitant psychiatrie il1ness. Other authors, have sugg~sted that wome~ with underlying psychopathology 1 should be'carefully screened from both empirical and treatment investigations of PMS, and recommend that t~eir psychiatrie diijorder be the prlrnary focus of treatment (Hamilton et aL, 1985a, Haskett et aL, 1980). The position adopted in the revised edition of the DSM-IIl, in its criteria for Periluteal Phase Dysphorie Disorder, appears to be the latter; that is, only women without , evid'ence of additional ps:(chop~thology will be clsssified research conducted w1th , , suoject groups delineated on the basis of the DSH-Ill criteria should, th~refore, ultimately clarify the extent of acco~pan~ing psychopathology in women reporting dy.phoric mood change premenstrually. What the current resulta do ~ 287 ., c '\" ( suggest is that a multidimensional premenstrual symptom picture exhibited by the --which , . includes depression --can apparentl~ occur in the absence v of affective pathology. The fact that no clear group of subjec~ reporting premenstrual depression alone was detected in the current research limi ts t;..he extent to which the second ques,tion can be addressed. What does emerge from the current data is that the symptom,profile of th~ confirmed PMO group does not suggest continuity with clinical depression. The profile of eonfirmed PMO subjects, while it included depr~ssive mood, al 50 included symptoms not associated with depr~s~ive\\ d isorder (e.g. water retent \u00efon, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea). As weIl, certain common symptoms of clinical depression were not prominent in. the profile of PMD subjects (e.g. sleep, appetite and libido disurbances). Furthermore, PMD subjects did not demonstrate cognitive sequellae a dysphorie attentional ~ias) hypothesized to co-occur with depression. In conclusion, whereas premenstrual dysphorie mood and cinical depression were found ta share an affect\u00cfve component which apparently differs in duration and, severity, they als~ demonstrated a discontinuity in phenomenological terms. The final ques~ion posed involved the potential relevance of PMD as history of depressi,ve disorder ,in women with pro~~ectively confirmed 298, , .. \" L 1 premenstrual \\ 1985b) each~ reported rates of a pp r 0 x i mat e l y 3 0 % Th i 5 i s cl 0 set a t h r e e p: tUne s the rat e for lifetime history reported in epidemiological aurvcys of .. women (Robins' et al., 1984).

The experimen~er (Shenker) read each script While seated in 'a shielded, sound at tenu'a ted room, w i th a \\.lit} i direct ional mi crophone worn around his neck to minimi~e amplitude changes which might otherwise result from head movement. The microphone cord was plugged into a wall o~tlet in ~he room. _ AlI scr ipts were recorded on one track of an open reel tape (BASF LH Super Hi Fi, DP-26), using a stereo tape recorder (sony 4-track, mod~l TC;788; tape speed 7.5 inches/second) ~ situated outside the sound attenuated roorn ... .' with its mie input cbnnect~d to a wall outlet out~ide the room. A r~search assistant operated the tape recorder and communicated with E (Shenker) verbally via microphone and earphones, aRd visua~ly through a window.~ The research assistant adjusted the record~ng level such that when E read at a comfortable amplitude, the VU me~er reglstered input at approximately the optimum . recording level, with amplitude peaks registering between -5 ) and +1 ~n the VU meter. The experimenter atternpted to read 1 aIl scripts at the\\ sarne amplitude. The research assistant moni~ored input levels during recording and, when E's , .amplitude deviated from this standard, signalled him and the , . stimulus was re-recorded . Approximately \\ 1 , all stimup were 'Obtained on this 'initial recor~Hng in this manner. AlI scripts were r~ad at approximately 120'words per , C minute. This rate was monitoredby the research assistant who timed a previously coun~ed l~0~word segment in the ( 'middle of each script. When necessa~y, scripts were \\ 0 re-recorded until they achieved .the desired rate of l presentation. This first tape is designated Tape 1. The stimuli recor~ed on Tape l were then dubbed onto a , second tape, des i gna ted Tape 2.. This was accompli shed by directly connecting the output jack of\u00b7 the Sony to the channel l input jack of a Revox Type A77 stereo tape \\. Il recorder set at 7.5 inches/second, wi-th trie Dolby system '- engaged. A, l0-second, .1000 cps ca li bra t i on tone was fi rs t il .; recorded at the beginning 01 the tape . In addition, a . l-second 1000 beg i nn i ng and -end 0 f each stimulus. Remaining amplitude variations between stimuli on Tape l were. removed as the st imul i w~re ~bed o,nto Tape 2. Th.,i s was ac~omplished by. adjusting the playback level' of the Sony ~nd the recording level of the Revox so that the VU meter of the Revox registered optimum recording amplitude, with peaks registering between -5 and +1. 'After the first scrIpt was r\u00e8co'rded in this way the playback levei of the Sony was adjusted for each subsequent stimulus to achle~e the same VU meter readings on the Revox. After completing Tape 2, the / /' 1 .. c .. n \u00b7success o~ these procedures in achieving approximately ~qual stimulqp amplit~~es was verified by playing the tape throug, headphones (Yamaha HP-l stereo hea?phones) into\u00b7a sound levei meter, and monitoring the amplitude peaks. , a The result of tnese proeeduresowas an bpen reel tape ~ (Tape 2) consisting of a 10-~econd 1000 CPS calibratIon .tone, and aIl target and distF~cter stimuli recorded on one channel,'at approximately equal amplitudes, with l-second . signal tones at the beginning and end of.each target st imul us. \"-The stimuli on Tape 2 were t~en thi~d tape, aeslgnated Tape 3, !fi tlie foIT\u00eb'-WIng-mann'er. The channel l output jack of the Revox was connected directly to the input jack on' a second Revox Type' A77 stereo ta~e recorder, with both machines set at 7.5 inches/second and Dolby systems engaged. Playback and record levels of the machines were set so that the c~ibration tone was recorded onto T~pe 3 with the VU meter of the recording machine registering +1. 'AlI target stimul~, with their signal tones, were then recorded onto channel 1 of Tape 3, with \\10-se~ond interstlmulus intervals. '. The machines were then set up, and calibrated in Othe same manner, to record distracter stimulI onto channel 2 of Tape 3 at the same amplitude as the target stimuli were recorded on channel 1. The specifie target-distracter il combinatlons were arranged ln the followlng manner: target stimuli which were designated to be practic~ and b?seline \\ .. ,trials were paired with non-dysphorie distrac~r stimuli;. thereafter pairings were ma\u00e2e such that non-dysphorie distraction trials alternated with dysphorie distraction trials, i .e o every second target stimulus was paired with a , dysphorie distracter stimulus. Coordination of channel l with stimulu~ with distracter stimulus) was'accomplished i? the 'fol1ow'ing manner for each pair of stimuli-. The tape 9 recorder containing the distracter, stimulus (Tape 2) 'wa~ stopped with the \"pause\" lever just before the first word of the stimulus. The tape ;ecorder containing tpe target stimulus (channel 1 <;>f \"Tape 3) was started, ~ith' E ' ' monitoring the playback via earphones. On~the l0th word of { the t~rget stimulus, the \"pause\" lpver af the iirst\"machine , iecorded ont'o 3. Thus, for each stimulu~1 'the target began first and after 10 words was joined by the di9tracter on the other channel. Since each target stimulus was approximately 120 words long; this left about 110 words on the target stimulus, the last l~ of which would not be -scored. That is, the segment of each target stimulus that will be scored for, shadowing errors is the 100 words which immediately follow the ~nset of distraction. For this reason, each distractor must be long enough ta caver that 100 ward target's next 10 words. These segments had aIl been timed prior ta this taping, and each distractor cou1~ be ended in several places. The end point was chosen 50 J c c .. that the distraetei covered th~ eritical l0~ word target segment, ~nd then terminated before the, targ~t did. The distraeter stimulus was terminated by ;topping Tape 2'with the \"pause\" lever of its tape reeordet~ '.. . ~hus, tor eaeh st imul the' target st.imul us on\u00b7 11 . channel 1 began first, preceded by its si~nal tone. The dfstra~ter stimulus on channel 2 began Hl words af,te\" the target's onset. The two stimuli eontinued simultaneously for at least the next 100 words of the target. Tqe J dlstraeter then terminated sometime,during the next 10 words '\" 0;. the tar~et, followed by termination of the target ~timulus,-10l10wed by the signal tone i~~ieating the end\" of\" that tri.al. This proced~e was followed for eaeh stimulus \\ pair, wlth 10-seeond intervals between trials. The result of these procedures, Tape 3, eonsisted of.2 practiee, reeorde~ at approximately'equal amplitudes and rates of presentation. The twenty pairs of experimental stimuli reeorded on Tape 3, as deseribed above, ~te designated Series X. The pr?cedures used ta m\u00e0ke Tape 3, above, were repeated in, the identieal manner to make another tape, Tape 4. This tape contajns Series Y, whieh differs from Series X in the fdllowing ways. Each target stimulus which is paired o with a dysphorie distraeter in Series X is pai~ed with a non-dysphorie distracter in Series Y. ft .~' . , -, ' targe~ stimulus which is paired with a non-dyspho~ic y. distracter in Series X is paired with a dysphorie distracter in Ser ies y'. In addition, the order in which targets and 1 . distracters \u00e9ccur was altered so thftt the or,der of presentation of stimuli on ~\u00e8ries X differs from that of 1 _ Series Y. Finally, although both s\u00e9ries contain alternating \"dysphorie with non-dysphorie distractions trials, Series X begins with a non~dysphoric distractipn trial and Series Y begins with a dsyp~oric d~straction trial: The final step in ~he production of the stimulus tapes was to dub the stimuli on Tapes -3 and 4 onto casse'\\te (Maxwell Low Noise C90) tapes. The open reel tapes were ~ed on the. Revox A-77 stereo tape recorder, with the output jacks of each channel connected directly to.the input jacks of the cotresponding channels of a stereo cassette (Yamaha 800 GL) tape recorder. Both channels were reco~ded 1 at equal amplitudes, with the VU meters of each of the . cassette recorder's channels registering bettween -5 the calibration tone and half th~ o trials were recorded onto one cassette,. and the calibration tone and remai~ing trials recorded onto a second ~aSsette. \\ , That is, for each series, X and y, two cassettes were ~ created, each with t(~n target distraction pairs. \" Each cassette, contalning half ~he stimuli of a series, fs < designated A an~ B. Thus, four cassettes were created, each containing ten, pairs of stimuli: Series X, parts A and Bi , i \" \"\" ..... ~~ j. , \" Series Y, parts A 'and B. Note that XA contains the same target and-distracter\u00b7stimuli as YA, but in different ta~get-distracter combinations and (orders.
