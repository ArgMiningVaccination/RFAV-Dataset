The vaccine target indication is for the prevention of CDI primary occurrence in at-risk individuals. At -risk individuals are defined as adults that require frequent and or prolonged antibiotic use and exposure to the healthcare environment, which may include hospitalization and/or long- term care, nursing h ome, or rehabilitation admission. C. difficile is the most common cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea and is responsible for up to 30% of all diarrhea cases among hospitalized patients (1). The primary reservoirs of C. difficile within hospitals and long- term care facilities include colonized or infected patients and contaminated environments and surfaces (1) (2). Once colonized, patients with C. difficile shed spore s in their feces. The incidence is also increasing among persons living in the community with recent healthcare contact (3). All pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce toxin B with or without toxin A, causing a variety of syndromes which vary widely in clinical spectrum and severity (diarrhea, colitis, pseudomembranous c olitis , toxic megacolon, and death) (4). There is a lack of standardized reporting mechanisms and surveillance definitions of CDI in most countries worldwide. T he worldwide CDI incide nce in the general hospital population has been estimated to range between 5 to 10 per 10,000 patients- days (5) (6) (7). In 2008, in a prospective incidence survey including 34 European countries, the overall incidence of hospital-acquired CDI was estimated at 4.1 cases per 10,000 patient-days and ranged from 0 to 36.3 among the different countries (7). The incidence and the severity of CDI have been increasing in recent years and remain underestimated (8). CDI attributed mortality is difficult to estimate due to the high level of co - morbiditi es among CDI patients. However, the estimated overall mortality attributable to CDI is approximately 6%, rising to 13% to 15% in older patients (9). Until recently, therapeutic options for the treatment of CDI have been limited to a few antibact erials , such as vancomycin, metronidazole and bacitracin. Fidaxomicin was approved in 2011 for the treatment of CDI in adults. For patients with non- severe disease, these treatments all provide effective treatment. Several other CDI targeted antimicrobial and non- antimicrobial agents are in various stages of development as current therapeutics are suboptimal secondary to the high incidence of relapsing disease and the potential for emergence of drug-resistance in non-clostridial bacteria. There is strong e vidence that these host immune responses to C. difficile toxins A and B have a substantial role in determining the clinical outcome of C. difficile infection. Serum anti-toxin immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels have been found to play an important role in determining the outcome of colonization and protection against a first episode of CDI. Patients who are asymptomatically colonized with C. difficile have higher serum levels, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), than colonized patients who develop diarrhea (10). This suggests that high anti -toxin A IgG levels at the time of colonization protect against CDI. The effectiveness of serum anti -toxin antibodies in protection from symptoms in colonized individuals and serum anti-toxin A and B antibodies in reduction of recurrent disease support the hypothesis tha t systemic humoral immunity against C. difficile toxins will prevent the manifestations of CDI in humans. It is anticipated that through active vaccination, the C. difficile Toxoid Vaccine will elicit broader difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 10 of 47 will be administered in a 3 -dose schedule on Days 0, 7, and 30. At the time of group assignment, 1650 subjects (10% of total enrollment) will be randomly assigned to an immunogenicity subset. 3,300 subjects (20% of total enrollmen t) will be randomly assigned to a reactogenicity subset , All subjects will provide blood samples for assessment at D0 (pre-injection) and D60. The immunogenicity subset from both study groups will also provide blood samples at D14, at D30 pre-injection, and every 6 months through the planned follow-up periods (i.e., up to 3.0 years after the third injection ). In a reactogenicity subset solicited A Es will be collected for 6 days following each injection. AEs will be collected for all subjects from D0 to D60. All SAEs will be collected through the end of the follow-up period. All subjects will be actively followed for efficacy with contact every 2 we eks throughout the study and follow-up period. This follow-up period may extend for up to 3.0 years after the last injection . Analyses of trial futility (non -efficacy) will be performed at the first 2 interim analyses. The study may be stopped if either of those analyses provides robust and compelling evidence that meaningful levels of vaccine efficacy (VE) will not be demonstrated. The 95% confidence interval (CI ) of the observed VE will be calculated at the 1 st (50 cases) and 2nd (100 cases) interim analyses. Futility will be claimed if the upper bound of the 95% VE CI is less than 46%. Analyses of efficacy will be performed at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th interim analyses as well as the final analysis with the total one -side type I error rate at 0.025 . The nomi nal significance levels for these 3 efficacy interim analyses are 0. 01, 0.0035 and 0.0032, respectively . The nominal significance levels are determined by the corresponding proportion of information assessed at each interim analysis (number of new cases at each interim / 250 * 0.025). The remaining alpha (0.0083) after the interim analyses will be used at the final analysis. Early termination for declaration of efficacy at any interim analysis will be made if the lower bound of VE CI at its associated nominal significance level is greater than 15%. . In addition to the aforementioned statistical criteria , a minimum of 12 months median follow-up duration after the last injection will be required to stop the trial early for efficacy. *Note : There are imperfections in the sensitivity and specificity of PCR . Given this, an observed 48%, 46%, and 42% VE correspond to an estimated true VE of 63%, 60%, and 55%. 3.2 Trial Plan Eligible subjects will be identified and enrolled. Each subject must sign and date the informed consent form before any procedure or treatment associated with the study is performed. Subjects will receive one injection of either C. difficile Toxoid V accine or placebo on Day s 0, 7, and 30. For subjects in the main study, blood (20 mL /bleed ) will be collected before injection at Visit 1 (D0) and at Visit 4 (60 days [+14] days after injection). At enrollment, 10% of subjects will be randomly assigned by interactive voice response system (IVRS)/ interactive web response system (IWRS) to an imm unogenicity subset. For these subjects, blood (20 mL /bleed ) for serologic testing will be collected before injection at Visit 1 Sanofi Pasteur SAP Core Body H-030-014 453 (SP0143) - Clostridium Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 11 of 47 (D0) and at Visit 3 (D14), Visit 4 (D30), Visit 5 (D60), Visit 6 (D210), and then every 6 months as long as the subject is in the trial. At enrollment, 20% of subjects will be randomly assigned by IVRS/IWRS to a reactogenicity subset of 3,300 subjects. These subjects will be asked to record solicited reactions for 6 days after each injection. All subjects will record unsolicited AEs that occur from D0 through D60 (30 days after the last injection). All subjects will be followed for safety for at least 6 months after the last injection. Subjects will be contacted on D210 (\u00b114 days) and up to 3.0 years (\u00b114 days) to ascertain whet her any additional SAEs not already reported occurred since the last contact. All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be collected in all subjects from D0 through the end of the follow-up period. During the follow-up period, subjects will be instructed to contact the clinical site if they are hospitalized or admitted to a long- term care or rehabilitation facility, or if they experience an AE that might be considered serious. All subjects will be followed for the follow -up period ( up to 3.0 years after the thi rd injection) for occurrence of repeated episodes of loose stools a nd provision of a stool sample. For all subjects, there will be a weekly contact (telephone, home or clinic visit) for 4 weeks after enrollment (D0 through D30) or following discharge from a hospital or long- term care or rehabilitation facility, to remind subjects to report repeated episodes of loose stools and provide stool samples, if applicable. Following the first 4 weeks, subjects will be contacted every 2 weeks for the duration of the study and follow -up period The method of contact may be by telephone, text message, email, and/or home visit; however, there must be subject contact via telephone or home visit once a month. If a subject is hospitalized, or is admitted to a long -term care or rehabilitation facility, the subject will be contacted once a week until discharge or for a maximum of 3 months to monitor the subjects for episodes of loose stools, for which a stool sample will be obtained and provided to the site. After discharge from the hospital or facility, the subjects will be contacted weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter for the remainder of the follow-up period as described above. Details of the surveillance plans are provided in the Operating Guidelines that will be given to the investigational sites before the start of the study. Additionally, a quality of life questionnaire will be completed following a repeated episode of loose stools for which a s ample is collected . When possible, subjects will complete the survey on their own or via telephone interview with the site staff. Two other quality of life questionnaires will be completed within 5 to 6 and 8 to 9 weeks after the beginning of each episode. For subjects in the immunogenicity subset, a quality of life questionnaire will also be completed at Visits 3, 6, 8, and 10. The questionnaire may be completed by the subject or may be administered and recorded by site staff v ia telephone or may be completed by a proxy in case the subject's condition is such that he or she is not able to answer.Sanofi Pasteur SAP Core Body H-030-014 453 (SP0143) - Clostridium difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 12 of 47 Table of Study Procedures for the Main Population: (N=1 4,850 out of a total of 16,500)* Phase I II Trial, minimum of 4 Visits, 3 Injec tions, a minimum of 2 Blood S amples, Telephone Calls/Contacts, 3.0 years Duration Per Subject *Note: There is a separate Table of Study Procedures for subjects in the immunogenicity subset (N=1,650) Visit Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Contact Contact Trial timelines (days or years) Day 0 Day 7 Day 30 Day 60 Day 210 up to 3.0 years after scheduled Visit 3 (D30) Time windows (days) - +3 days 3 to +7 days +14 days \u00b114 days \u00b114 days Informed consent X Inclusion/exclusion criteria X Collection of demographic data X Urine pregnancy test* X X X Medical history X Contraindications X X Physical examination X X X Temperature X X X Randomization/allocation of subject number and unique product kit number X Allocation of a unique product kit number X X Blood sampl e (BL), 20 mL/bleed BL1 BL2 Injec tion (vaccine or placebo) X X X Immediate surveillance (30 min) X X X Diary card (DC) or memory aid (MA) provided\u00a7 DC1 DC2 DC3 MA Clostridium difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 13 of 47 Memory aid for loose stools (MA -LS)\u00a7 MA-LS Diary card (DC) collected\u00a7 DC1 DC2 DC3 Collection of solicited injection site & systemic reactions** 6 days after each injec tion Collection of unsolicited AEs\u00a7 From Day 0 through 30 days after the last injec tion Collection of reportable concomitant medications X X X X X X Telephone call X Trial termination record X Provision of stool sample\u00a7\u00a7 Throughout the trial Surveillance*** Throughout the trial Completion of quality of life questionnaire Throughout the trial Collection of SAE s Throughout the trial * For women of child-bearing potential.

For fever, they will record the body temperature, and the classification as Grade 1, 2, or 3 will be assigned by the difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 25 of 47 reporting if relevant information became available later (e.g., outcome, medical history, results of investigations, copy of hospitalization reports). The Investigator will assess the causal relationship between the SAE and the investigational product as eithe r \"Not related\" or \"Related\". 4.2.6.5 Assessment of Causality At each vaccination visit, the Investigator or a delegate will perform a clinical or medically -driven physical examination, and will ask the subject about any solicited reactions (only for those subjects in the reactogenicity subset) and unsolicited AEs recorded in the diary card, as well as about any other AEs that may have occurred since the previous visit. All relevant data will be transcribed into the eCRF according to the instructions provided by the Sponsor. The action taken by the subject to treat any solicited reactions will be classified in the eCRF using the following scale: 0: None 1: Medication (self -medication with an existing prescription or over- the-counter medication) 2: Health care provider contact (no new medication prescribed) 3: Health care provider contact and prescription of a new medication (health care provider instructed subject to take a new medication, either an over -the-counter medication or one requiring a wr itten prescription) 4: Hospitalization (inpatient) The action taken by the subject to treat any unsolicited AEs will be classified in the eCRF using the following scale: 0: None 1: Medication (self -medication with an existing prescription or over- the-count er medication) 2: Health care provider contact (no new medication prescribed) 3: Health care provider contact and prescription of a new medication (health care provider instructed subject to take a new medication, either an over -the-counter medication or one requiring a written prescription) The Investigator will assess the causal relationship between each unsolicited systemic AE and vaccination as either not related or related, based on the following definitions 2: 0: Not related - The AE is clearly / most probably caused by other etiologies such as subject's underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between vaccination and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relationship; or the AE started before the first vaccination (screening phase, if applicable) 1: Related - There is a \"reasonable possibility\" that the AE was caused by the vaccination, meaning that there is evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship 2 ICH Guidelines, Clinical Safety Data difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 29 of 47 has not increased in intensity, it is to be attributed to the earlier dose, and is recorded as just a single AE. If it has increased in intensity, it will be treated as 2 AEs: the date of the later dose will be considered to be the end date for the first AE and the start date of the second AE. Unsolicited adverse reactions are unsolicited AEs considered related to vaccination, either as determined by the investigator, or because they occurred at the injection site. The conventions for imput ing a value of \"Missing\" in Section 4.4.1.2.1 to Section 4.4.1.2.7 below apply only to tables ; in listings, data will be shown as reported. In general, unsolicited AEs will include immediate AEs and SAEs. 4.4.1.2.1 Causality AEs considered related to vaccination, either as determined by the investigator, or because they occurred at the injection site. Unsolicited non- serious AEs and SAEs with missing causality will be considered as related to vaccination. 4.4.1.2.2 Intensity In tables, the intensity will be recorded by the investigator for AE whose scale is not a measure. For measurable AE, the intensity will be calculated at the time of statistical analysis. Missing measurements (for temperature or length) will not be replaced. Note for SAEs: Intensity will not be collected. 4.4.1.2.3 Start Date Start date is the first date the event was present. Unsolicited events with a missing or partial start date will be assumed to have occurred between D0 and D30 and thus will be included in tables of events between these two days. 4.4.1.2.4 Last Vaccinatio n before Unsolicited AE or SAE The last vaccination before AE or SAE is defined as the most recent vaccination received by the subject before the event is present. 4.4.1.2.5 Action Taken Action taken for each reaction will be reported, see Section 4.2.6.5. Missing action taken will not be imputed. 4.4.1.2.6 Outcome (for SAEs) Missing outcome will not be imputed for SAEs. 4.4.1.2.7 Seriousness (for SAEs) An SAE may have more than one seriousness category.

For imm unogenicity, descriptive statistics will be provided for the antibody response concentration against toxins contained in the each treatment group. In general, categorical variables will be summarized and presented by frequency counts, percentages, and CIs. The 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and exact binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for percentages. For GMCs, 95% CIs of point estimates will be calculated using normal approximation assuming they are log-normally distributed. The CI of the difference in proportion will be calculated using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction. Reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDC) figures will be provided for the antibody concentrations against each toxin. 5.1 Statistical Methods 5.1.1 Hypotheses and Statistical Methods for Primary Objective The primary hypotheses in this study are testing efficacy and futility. 5.1.1.1 Primary Hypothesi s for Efficacy The primary statistical null hypothesis is that there is no greater than a 15% reduction* in the risk of PCR -confirmed cases of CDI among the subjects receiving the vaccine relative to subjects receiving placebo. Formally the trial difficile Toxoid Vaccine difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 43 of 47 converted in the same way (i.e., fold -rise = 1.0). For any calculations, a titer reported as > upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) will be converted to a value of ULOQ. No replacements will be done. In all subject listings, partial and missing data will be clearly indicated as missing. 5.4.3 Efficacy The method of multiple imputations will be used where missing data will be imputed under a Missing At Random (MAR) assumption. The primary analytic results will be deemed robust if the conclusions are unchanged across a reasonable range of departures from the MAR assumption. 5.5 Interim/Preliminary Analysis The study is designed as an event-driven, group sequential protocol with 4 interim analyses at 50, 100, 135, 167 primary clinical endpoints (i.e., PCR-confirmed primary CDI episodes), and a final analysis. The first interim will assess futility only after observing 50 primary CDI case. The second interim analysis will assess futility and efficacy after observing 100 primary CDI cases. The third and fourth interim analysis will assess efficacy and occur when 135 and 167 primary clinical endpoints are observed, respectively. A final ana lysis will be done when the trial stops. In case of observing the milestone number of symptomatic PCR- confirmed primary CDI cases to trigger an interim analysis, an interim analysis of the futility and efficacy of the vaccine relative to placebo for the primary futility and efficacy endpoint will be reviewed by the IDMC. The IDMC may recommend stopping the trial based on the statistical significance guidelines in the IDMC charter for early stopping. In addition to the statistical guideline s for early stopping, the IDMC may provide an additional guideline for early stopping based on the average duration of follow-up from enrollment by study participants. Specifically, IDMC may recommend early stopping of the trial for purpose of efficacy only if the statistical test criterion is met and the median duration of follow -up is no less than 12 months after injection. Although simulation studies indicate that the average duration of follow-up will be no less than 12 months at the time that a sequenti al trial boundary is achieved with very high probability, this parameter will be monitored closely and an interim analysis will be delayed to ensure that the duration of follow-up criterion, median duration of follow-up is no less than 12 months after inje ction, is met before the interim statistical analysis for efficacy is performed. In this case, a small adjustment to the nominal significance level at which the interim analysis is performed will be used based on the alpha-spending function used in Section 5.1.1.2. Refer to the IDMC charter on the steps how the IDMC recommendations are made. If the IDMC recommendation is to change the course of the t rial (i.e., stop the trial for futility or efficacy), the Sanofi Pasteur unblinded s tatistician (SPUS) will validate the IDMC decision . The SPUS will independently calculate VE and the associated CI for the primary efficacy objective and compare it to the independent statistician -generated values. If the SPUS finds no discrepancy with the independent statistician values, this will be confirmed to the Sponsor representative. If the SPUS identifies a discrepancy with the independent statistician value s, the S PUS will inform Sponsor representative of the discrepancy , and contact the independent statistician to investigate the discrepancy and resolve it. Sanofi Pasteur unblinded review difficile Toxoid Vaccine Confidential/Proprietary Information Page 45 of 47 monitored during both enrollment stages of the trial. If the fraction enrolled to any 1 stratum drops below 30%, then the study team will review the operational approaches to recruitment and recommend changes to the approach that will increase the relative rate of enrollment to the smaller group. 5.8 Data Review for Statistical Purpose s Review of the data is anticipated through the data review process led by data management before database lock. Any review of the data will include a statistica l review, for completeness and data range assessments. Reviews will be conducted on the blinded data. 5.9 Changes in the Conduct of the Trial or Planned Analyses This SAP complies with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance and relevant Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. It is based on Version 7.0 of the study protocol dated 14 February 2017. If the protocol is subsequently amended, this SAP may be amended as well. Should the SAP and the protocol be inconsistent with respect to the planned analyses, the language of the SAP is governing.
