Soak up the sun on a stretch of fine white sand, or commune with the tropical creatures as you dive along coral ridges or the colorful wreck of a WWII war ship. On shore, the lush jungle shelters stone temples and mischievous monkeys. The \"artistic capital\" of Ubud is the perfect place to see a cultural dance performance, take a batik or silver-smithing workshop, or invigorate your mind and body in a yoga class.Read more - Great Barrier ReefThe world's largest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef stretches almost 1500 miles into the Pacific from the tip of Queensland. Designated a Marine Park by the Australian government and a World Heritage Area by UNESCO, the reef is home to an extraordinary abundance of species and habitats. Snorkeling, diving and fishing are rightly popular along the reef, nowhere more so than on the Whitsunday Islands, where the silica sands and aqua waters of the Coral Sea create the perfect beach escape.Read more - KeralaIn this lush, tourist-friendly southern state, positioned between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats, beaches, waterfalls, rice paddies and verdant green hills create a postcard-perfect landscape. Houseboats traverse its many waterways, providing an intimate look at its rural terrain. Rejuvenation programs through Ayurveda (alternative, natural medicine) are popular here; the cool June and mid-October monsoon seasons are considered ideal for healing therapies.Read more - UdaipurUdaipur, known as the Venice of the East, boasts several sparkling lakes against a backdrop of the Aravail hills. Jag Niwas and Jag Mandir, islands in Fateh Sagar Lake, are the site of Udaipur Solar Observatory and Nehru Garden. Famous palaces include the magical Lake Palace, now a luxurious five-star hotel, and the massive City Palace on Pichola's east bank, featuring epic courtyards and stunning paintings.Read more - MahabaleshwarThe city of Mahabaleshwar is a pinnacle of greenery, boasting one of the only evergreen forests in the world. The landscape abounds with lush hills, valleys and lookout points such as Lodwick Point, Arthur's Seat and Babington Point, all of which offer spectacular views. Trot along on horseback for a delightful four-legged tour of the gorgeous Venna Lake area, and savor juicy native strawberries, mulberries and corn.Read more - RajasthanThe state of Rajasthan in northwestern India includes part of the Thar Desert, as well as Ranthambhor National Park, home to wild tigers, and verdant Mount Abu and its elaborate temples. A camel safari near the inhabited desert trading center of Jaisalmer gives a hint of the area's beautiful desolation. Udaipur's lakefront setting provides rich counterpoint. The capital of Jaipur is a shopper's dream. Hire a car and driver to take in the spread-out sights. Stay in a heritage hotel to feel like a maharaja.Read more - PuriCoastal charm meets cultural heritage in the sacred city of Puri, where pilgrims flock annually to celebrate the Ratha Yatra. Besides world-famous temples, Puri boasts beaches and markets that buzz year-round, while the wetland landscape beyond the city retains its wild edge.Read more - Nusa Dua PeninsulaRead more - Riau Islands ProvinceRead more - MaharashtraRead more No other properties match all your filters.
