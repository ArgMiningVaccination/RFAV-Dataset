It is still recommended that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated, remain up to date, and take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Test to Treat Program Free and Easier Access to Treatment The Test to Treat program can provide faster, easier access to lifesaving COVID-19 treatments. If you test positive within five days of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, or have COVID-19 symptoms and are a close contact of someone recently diagnosed with COVID-19, such as a family member, you can meet with a healthcare provider (either on-site or virtually through telehealth), and if eligible, get a prescription for an oral antiviral treatment and have that prescription filled\u2014all at one location. This service is available for uninsured patients with no out-of-pocket costs at participating locations. If you are interested in visiting a physical location to find out if you are eligible for treatment, visit [the Test to Treat locator](https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/) site to find a location near you. If you are interested in meeting virtually with a healthcare provider to see if you are eligible for treatment, [the free telehealth](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/treatments/telehealth) service is another option. If you test positive for COVID-19 at home, you can consult with a healthcare provider using a smartphone or computer with a high-speed internet connection. If this is not an option, you can also talk with a healthcare provider by phone. If appropriate, you will receive a prescription for either free home delivery or pharmacy pickup. What Are Oral Antivirals? Oral antiviral treatment help your body fight COVID-19 by stopping the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) from multiplying in your body. By getting treatment, you could have less serious symptoms and may lower the chances of your illness getting worse and needing care in the hospital. Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 are available for individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, who are not in the hospital, who have had symptoms for five days or less, and who are at high risk for severe illness. - More information: [What Are Oral Antivirals information sheet languages](/emergencies/covid-19/resources-and-recommendations#treatments) What Are Intravenous Antivirals? [Remdesivir](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antiviral-therapy/remdesivir/) is an established antiviral drug that is FDA approved and is not currently distributed by WADOH. It works by blocking the virus from making copies of itself (replicating). Remdesivir is given through a needle in the vein (intravenously) over time, which is called an IV infusion. Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of non-hospitalized adults and children who are at high risk for severe COVID-19. On April 25, 2022, the FDA expanded this approval to include children at least 28 days old who weigh at least 3 kg (about 6.6 pounds) and who are at risk for developing severe disease, making remdesivir the first FDA-approved treatment for children under age 12. Remdesivir should be started as soon as possible, and within seven days of when symptoms began, so it's important for people at high risk to connect with their health care provider if they have symptoms and test positive for COVID-19. The treatment is given as a series of three IV infusions, given once a day for three consecutive days. Not all health care facilities can offer outpatient remdesivir treatment - patients should speak to their health care provider to see if it may be a potential treatment option. Remdesivir is also used to treat patients who are hospitalized with more severe illness due to COVID-19. If you are hospitalized due to COVID-19, your health care providers will decide if remdesivir or other treatments are needed.
