Energy healing is a holistic practice where healers channel universal life force (or healing energy) into a patient to help balance, heal and remove blockages from the body. Flow, balance, harmony and vitality within the body can be restored and maintained during a treatment. Energy Medicine includes a variety of holistic healing modalities like: Reiki Energy Healing, Light Therapy, Acupuncture, Reflexology, Thai Massage, Tapping, and more. Your energetic body has a crucial role to play towards your wellbeing journey. Here are 5 things everyone needs to know about Energy Healing: 1. Energy Healing is Based on Scientific Fact Everything in this universe is composed of molecules that are vibrating at various frequencies. The molecules located within our bodies are constantly vibrating and radiating positive or negative, balanced or unbalanced, opened or closed frequencies. When our organs are misaligned energetically and radiating low-vibrational frequencies, it can materialize into physical ailments, like pains, sickness and disease. 2. Energy Medicine Can Help Heal Physical and Emotional Traumas Our energetic bodies are intertwined with our physical bodies. All the traumas we carry physically, emotionally and psychologically impact the functionality of our energy systems (chakras) and vice versa. To maintain vibrant health, the body needs its energies to have energetic space to flow freely throughout the body. When energies become blocked because of traumas, toxins, prolonged stress and muscular constrictions, it creates disturbances in the energy flow in our bodies, which over time contributes to mental, emotional issues and/or ailments and physical disease. 3. Energy Healing is Available to Everyone There is often a misconception that you need to be spiritual to be open and receptive to energy healing. Energy healing is readily available to everyone who is interested and willing to receive it. You don't need to be spiritual or hypersensitive to energies to benefit from an energy healing treatment. As humans (just like every living being), we all have an energetic body that needs to be balanced and taken care of regularly. Some energy medicine modalities, like reiki treatments, transcend time and space. Therefore, you don't have to be located in the same room, city or even country as your energy healer to receive and benefit from energy healing treatment. 4. Energy Medicine is Painless and has no Negative Side Effects During an energy healing treatment, patients will feel little to no physical discomfort. During the majority of the session, patients will be lying comfortably on a bed while the practitioner non-invasively assesses their aura and releases energetic blockages from the body. As the blockages are being released and chakras are being balanced, patients will experience a rebalancing process that may evoke a variety of emotions or physical sensations, like tiredness, anger, sadness, emptiness, or light headedness. This usually occurs when a deeply embedded trauma or attachment is finally released from the physical, emotional and energetic bodies. It is essential to allow your mind, body and soul to acknowledge the trauma that has been released during your energy healing treatment and fill that space with new, light, healing energies. 5. Energy Medicine Works with Almost Every Other Type of Healing Energy healing therapy has been used to treat various health conditions and complements many other forms of treatments and therapies. Combining holistic therapies, like Reiki Energy Healing, with conventional health treatments can help you optimize your health and wellbeing. There is no \"one size fits all\" when it comes to healing. Energy medicine doesn't replace Western Medicine and vice versa. But, together various forms of healing modalities and therapies can work in conjunction to effectively support, balance, restore, cure and repair your body. "}
