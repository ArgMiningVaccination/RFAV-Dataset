ReMAP findings and recommendations rest on a large foundation of work of hundreds of scientists who worked for thousands of hours, over m onths and years, to prioritize research w ithin each OBPR scientif ic discip line. It is noteworthy that the comm ittee was successful, d uring m eeting deliberations, in establishing a rationale and strategies for prio ritization of the ov erall research program for OBPR and for ISS. The findings and recom mendations in this repo rt provide a fram ework for prioritizing a productive research program for NASA's Office of Biological a nd Physical Research (OBPR) and for the International Space Statio n (ISS). The report identifies tw o overarc hing programmatic goals. The first inv olves research enab ling hum an exploration of space. The second involves basic research of intrinsic scien tific interest. The broad OBPR program encompasses research using the ISS, shuttle, free-flyers and ground-based capabilities. The ISS has unique features not available on any other vehicle, in cluding hum an tended, long duration (>1m o) exposure to m icrogravity. ReMAP prioritized work that can be done on ISS with the US Core Complete1 configuration, ReMAP identif ied enha ncem ents to Core plete c onfiguration which will enab le a scienc e driv en program of highest pr iority re search. The context for estab lishing the ReMAP Force is budget states: \"This year, NASA wil l be working with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to engage the scientific comm unity and establish clear high-priority, affordable scien ce objectives with near-term focus on improving scientific productivity. The result s of this review will help set the scien ce agenda for Biological and Physical Research th at will in tu rn drive how the Space Station is used . It should increase the efficiency and output of research at the Statio n, and realig n NASA's Research cu rrent prio rities .\" The NASA Advisory Council (NA C) requested that NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research (O BPR) act upon the Intern ational Space Station Ma nagem ent and Cost Evaluation Task Force (IMCE) conclusion: \"Scientif ic research prio rities must be established an executable program , consistent with those prio rities, m ust be developed and im plemented.\" In consultation with OSTP and the Office of Managem ent and Budget (OMB), OBPR assem bled an ad-hoc external advisory comm ittee, imization and Prioritiz ation (ReMAP) Task Force, to assist OB PR in establishing a pr ioritized progr am for its research portfolio. 1 See d efinition, Appendix O i Basis of ReMAP activities: The ReMAP Task Force has used the Term s of Reference (A ppendix A) jointly developed by NASA, the OMB, and the OSTP, along with the charge to the Task Force from the NASA Adm inistrator (delivered at the first and third m eetings), to form the basi s of its activities.

Statem ents of Dissent Nom enclature Summary 1.0 Execu tive Summary Perspectiv e: NASA has a stake in so me of the bi ggest in tellectual p roblems in science: the o rigin of life, the nature of the solar system, hum an exploration outside the planet, and th e characterization of Earth from space. In sev eral areas of biological and physical research, solutions of very large, important questions require m icrogravity. ISS provides a unique environ ment for attacking thes e problem s \"as only NASA can.\" The committee was unanimous in the view that the ISS is unpreceden ted as a labo ratory and is the only available platform for hum an tended research on long-duration effect s of m icrogravity. The Task Force has ma de the follo wing primary findings: OBPR research includes work that is best pe rform ed on ISS, as well as studies best done on the groun d or on othe r platf orms such as the S huttle o r free-flyers. The highest priority research for ISS fa lls into two broad categories: research emphasizing hum an exploration of sp ace, a nd that em phasizing in trinsic scientific importance and im pact, with som e work m eeting both goals. Priori tization between th ese categories is a NASA pr ogramm atic decision. The assignment of priorities was done at the level of OBPR research them es and not at the level of individual research projects. The ranking of priority 1 to a given them e area constitutes o ur statement that th ere a re very im portant r esearch questions w ithin this research them e, and doe s not suggest a blanket endorsem ent of all the projects within an area. According to the prelim inary OBPR Im plementation Analysis for ISS presented to ReMAP, at \"US Core Com plete\" an d at \"US+ IP Core Complete,\"2 the capability to do high priority research is lim ited due to c onstraints im posed by crew tim e and lack of upmass capacity. The Task Force has ma de the follo wing primary recommendations: ISS Research Productivity: NASA m ust res olve the up mass and crew research time issues. Current ISS Productivity: As ISS nears com pletion, NASA should increase science priority and productivity on ISS. Basic Resea rch: OBPR should include in its high-pri ority research portfolio, outstanding basic scientific research program s that addr ess important questions in the physical and biological sciences, and which require long-te rm experim ents on the ISS, based on their intrinsic scie ntific valu e. Implementation of ISS Research Facilities: NASA should ensure the imple mentation of high priority facilities, such as the centrifuge and habitats. 2 See de finitions, Appendix O 1Exec utive Summary Fully Utiliz e Available Op tions fo r Space Research: NASA should consider additional Shuttle s cience/comm ercial f light opportunities. Science on ISS: If enhancem ents to ISS beyond US Core Complete are not anticipated, NASA should cease to characterize the ISS as a s cience d riven program . Coordination w ith Internationa l Partners : NASA should continue coordination of facilities d evelopm ent and resea rch solic itations with the International P artners (IP), and attem pt to address the IP concerns. 2Specific Findings Bioastronautics 2.0 Specific Findings on Research Prio rities 2.1 Task Force Priorities w ithin OBPR Divisions The 4 Divisions of OBPR are organiz ed into 8 Research Themes as follow s: A.

Bioastronautics Research Division A.1 Biom edical Research and Counterm easures A.2 Advanced Hum an Support Technology Bioastronautics research is design ed to increase knowledge and im prove the health and safety of humans in space. Several physio logical ad aptati ons to m icrogravity that increase the risk to human health in space h ave been identified. None are understood com pletely. Bioastronautics translates new insight from funda mental resear ch of the genetic, m olecular, cellu lar, and organ ef fects of microgravity in to tre atments that prevent o r ameliorate th e untoward or undesirab le consequences of space trav el to hum ans. This research integ rates understanding of differe nt mechanism s compro mised in m icrogravity as a basis for risk assessm ent and clin ical testing of therapeutic co unterm It drives the developm ent of miniaturized, autom ated, and rem ote sensing m edical equipment to reduce cost and tim e for diagnosis or treatm ent, enhancing health and safe ty of crews and im proving terrestrial health care in rem ote areas. Bioastronautic s research fosters developm ent of new medical interventions by studying physiological changes in m icrogravity that mimic, or m ay be identical to, hum an aging and diseas e states. This space research platform offers a unique test b ed to evaluate radiation and biologic al protection that m ay improve te rrestrial m itigation of disaste rs or terro rism. 3Specific Findings Bioastronautics A.1 Biomedical Research & Countermeasures Description Research in this them e area is focused on unders tanding effects of the space environm ent that may impair hum an health and perform ance, a nd on developing counterm easures that m itigate such problem s. The research includes both grou nd- and space-based studies, and m odel studies with anim als as well a s clinical research with hum ans. The r esearch includes studies in radiation health, integrated and organ system physiology, clin ical/operational m edicine in space, behavior and performance in th e space enviro nment, and environm ental health. While ground based studies are essen tial in th is theme area to develop hypotheses and counterm easure proto cols that can th en be tested in space, research on th e ISS is essen tial for evaluation o f the long-term effects of the space environm ent and fo r flight testing of counterm easures. Altho ugh m ost radiation h ealth investigations will be conducted on the ground usin g radiation s ources such as the NAS A facility at Brookhaven, som e aspects of the space rad iation environment cannot b e duplicated on Earth and the effects must be stud ied with long-duration investigations in space. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations There were a num ber of com prehensive previ ous reports available that included clear recomm endations, increasing the Task Force confid ence that their findings would be grounded in a wealth of data f rom the scien tific community. The m ajor sources for recommendations, and the basis of the following summary, are: A Strategy for Research in Space Biol ogy and Medicine in the New Century , NRC, 1998 Review of NASA's Biomedical Research Program , NRC, 2000 Safe Passage, IOM, 2000 In addition to num erous disc iplinary recomm endations, the 1 998 strategy report included a specific list of recomme ndations for high priority research. The criterion for highest priority was research aimed at unde rstanding and am eliorating problem s that m ay limit the astronauts' ab ility to survive and/or functi on during prolonged spaceflight. Such studies include basic as well as applied research and ground-based as well as flight experim ents. Accordingly, NASA s hould focus on aspects of research in which NASA has unique capabilities or that are underem phasized by other agencies. High priority opportunities were identified in integrative and organ system physiology, in psychological and social issues and in health ca re. Development of effective, m echanism -based counterm easures was co nsidered a n ecessary outcom e of the recomm ended research in all areas. Problem s considered to have pot entially serious consequences fo r long-duration spaceflight and research to address th e problem s are: Loss of w eight-bearing bone and muscle: Carry out m echanistic studies on ground and in flight, with anim al models and hum ans, leading to developm ent of effective counterm easures. Studies should provide data bases on the course of m icrogravity-related 4Specific Findings Bioastronautics bone loss, muscle m ass and tone in hum ans and its reversibility, and on pre-, in-, and post flight horm one profiles on hum ans. Vestibular function, vest ibular-ocular reflex and sensorimotor integration: Highest priority should be given to studies designe d to determ ine how the vestibular system compensates for loss/perturbation of gravit ational cues in space and on the ground. Inflight recordings of peri pheral and central nervous syst em responses should be m ade following stimulation of the otolith (gravity se nsing com pone nt of the vestibular system ). Cardiovascular alterations: Current knowledge of the m agnitude, tim e course and mechanis ms of cardiovascular changes in l ong-duration spaceflight should be extended, and the specific m echanism s underlying orthos tatic intolerance upon return to 1 g should be determ ined. Radiation ha zards: Determ ine carcinogenic and central nervous system risks following irradiation by protons and high atom ic num ber-high energy (HZE) particles; determ ine how crew selection and s pace vehicle design aff ect the radiatio n environm ent of the crew; and determ ine whether effects of radiation a nd stress on the function of organs and other system s, including the immune system could produce additive/synergistic effects on host defenses in flight. Psychological and social issues: Highest priority should be given to interdisciplinary research on the neurobiological and psychologi cal m echanisms underlying the effects of physical and psychological e nvironmental stressors on the crew; experim ents should include an alogue settin gs as well as spaceflight. High priority should be given to evaluation of existing counterm easures and developm ent of effective new counterm easures. Health ca re in long-dur ation flight: NASA should develop a strategic health care research plan to predict, develop and valid ate preventative, diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitativ e measures fo r care of astronauts. Findings of the Task Fo rce The Task Force ag reed o n the following priori ties for the biomedica l research areas: Radiation Health : Priority 1. Rad iation h ealth hazards bo th on the ISS and for exploration beyond LEO pose a sign ificant crew health risk. Behavior and performance: Priority 1. Eviden ce from isolated comm unitie s and previous space m issions indicate that psychol ogical issues can becom e serious, and could potentially b ecom e mission destroy ing. This is e ven m ore critica l becaus e the ISS cr ews are, and f uture explo ration crew s are likely to b e, multicultura l. Physiology (Integrated and Organ System Physiology): Priority 1. A range of biom edical areas involv e potentially serious challenges to crew health in l ong-duratio n space fligh t, specif ically those sys tems sensitive to gravitatio nal changes including bo ne, m uscle, cardiovascular, neurovestibular and endocrine system s. Clinical/Op erational M edicine: Priority 1. NASA m anage ment must decide the acceptab le level of risk f or dealing with crew illness and in jury on various space pla tform s and to achie ve the capab ility to prov ide this level of care. First priority is recommended only for the study of the clinical /operational m edical problems that require research (not equipm ent developm ent) to achieve this goal, and that address high likelihood, high consequence areas for crew health. 5Specific Findings Bioastronautics Environmental Hea lth: (Includes aspects of Gravit ational Ecology) Priority 4. This research enables understanding of the environm ental health risks that occur because of microgravity and the co nfined and isolated living quarters of space. Toxicology and microbiology m easurements and standards deve lopm ent take place as p art of routine operations on both Shuttle and Station, and ther e was little evidence in the long life of Mir that m icrobial contam ination was a m ajor issue. Additionally, no specifically testable hypotheses have been developed concerning pote ntial environm ental he alth risks directly related to th e space env ironm ent. The Task Force ag reed that the h ighest priority research sho uld be in tho se areas where problem s could lead to significant lim itation or even term ination of IS S or exploratory space missions. Thus, the highest priorities should be based on research aim ed at understanding and elim inating problem s that m ay lim it astronauts' health or f unction during prolonged space flight. W ith three astronauts on board ISS at US Core Com plete and a total of 20 hours per week devoted to \"research\" (of that, only about 9 hour s are available for OBPR research), it is clear that this will limit the am ount of human tended res earch that can be com pleted in space. The science priorities for hum an health and safety resear ch should be given a top priority in research-rel ated activities of the crew. Ground based research should be aim ed at developm ent of hypotheses that can then be tested in space. W hile the ISS is the only platform for l ong-term studies and research that requires only short exposu re to m icrogravity could be accomm odated on Sh uttle, bo th currently req uire a long lead tim e for assignm ent to, and prep aration for, actual space flight. This requires that much of the BRC research be focused on ground-based studies to provide the basis for experim ents that will even tually be carrie d out in space, to ensure the continu ity of a group of high quality investigators, and to foster th e training of graduate and post- graduate students as the next generation o f comm itted investigato rs. In other words, sca rce resourc es should not be used f or low priority experim ents in space just because th at is all that can be done at th is tim e. It is b etter to do high q uality research on the ground than lo w quality research in sp ace. The use of anim al model system s (most comm only rats and m ice) is esse ntial f or investiga tions of physiological m echanism s that cannot be carried out on hum an subjects and to obtain a sample size that will giv e statistically significan t findings within a reasonable tim eframe. Such studies m ust be carried out in space as well as in 1 g, and include long duration experim ents that requir e the I SS and the a vailab ility o f adequate rodent habitats and a m icrogravity centrifuge. Attem pts to develop new counterm easures shou ld be m echanism based and hypothesis driven. An exa mple was provided in the sleep field . If astronau ts in space have trouble sleeping, the developm ent of counterm easures could be based on testing v arious s leeping pills. Or it could be based on developing a better understanding of the sleep and circadian clock system with the developm ent of treatm ent based on that understanding at the m echan istic levels. The latter is hypothesis driven and should be the approach taken by NASA. 6Specific Findings Bioastronautics Studies on astronauts on ISS should have the same rigor as clini cal research in hum ans on Earth, including a com plete understandi ng of the m edical and pharm acologi cal history of the subjects. It is im portant that Biomedical Research and Counterm easures at tract the very top scientists working in biological and biom edical research in the sam e way that som e of the other science them es attra ct the v ery best in their r espective f ields. Thus, more consider ation needs to be given to involving scientists th at are engaged in high-quality res earch such as that funded by the NIH and NSF. A.2 Advanc ed Human Support Technology Description The central and param ount challeng e for hum an exploration of space is to provide an environm ent consistent with the sustained existen ce of personnel outside of Earth's atmosphere. This includes protection against ionizing radiation; control of te mperature, pressure, hum idity, and waste products within prescr ibed lim its; provisions for ad equately balanced food supply, potable water and hygienic water; and adequate physical activity. Th e research includes technologies enabling environm ental monitoring a nd control, space hum an factors engineering, advanced life support, and advan ced extravehicular activity (EVA). For all resea rch in th is theme area, prelim inary concepts and techniques can be developed through ground-based research. However, research on the ISS is essential to test prom ising technolog ies in the hum an-enabled sp ace research environm ent, to confirm that th ey work properly o r to perf orm rapid ite ration s on de sign param eters until they do work prope rly. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations There were a num ber of well-researched previous reports available with clear recommendations, thereby increasing the Task For ce confidence that their findings would be grounded in a wealth of data from the scientific community. The m ajor repor ts con sulted inclu de: Advanced Technology for Human Support in Space , NRC, 1997 A Strategy for Research in Space Biol ogy and Medicine in the New Century , NRC, 1998 Safe Passage: Astronaut Care for Exploration Missions , Institute of Medicine, 2001 Microgravity Research in Support of Technology for Human Exploration and Development of Space a nd Planetary Bodies , NRC, 2000 From an ana lysis of these reports, it is eviden t that the key to understa nding life support system s and their subsystem s is the concept of hom eostasi s, or m aintaining constant, optim al levels of various physical, ch emical and bio logical sy stem s necessary for life suppo rt. An im portant go al is to achieve, as close as practi cal, a closed ecological life suppor t system requiring the input of a minimum of m ass and energy and in which as ma ny subsystem s as possible utilize recycling, accommodated by the developm ent of effective in terfaces between bioreg enerative an d physio- chem ical processes. To im prove safety, effici ency, and reliability, and reduce crew maintenan ce and m onitoring dem ands, risk-based prior itizatio n of monitoring and control system s related to environm ental chem ical and m icrobial contam inants and life support processes are required for both steady state and off-nom inal conditions. And, as NASA looks to longer duration space missions and possible p lanetary surface m issions - lunar or Martian - ad vanced EVA 7Specific Findings Bioastronautics technologies and understanding of hum an percep tion, cognition, perform ance, behavior and habitability increasingly im portant. High priority activ ities identified in the reports for each of the m ain research thrus ts include: Advanced Life Support Treatm ent and recovery of resources from air, water and solid waste, including technologies for system loop closure to m inimize resupply Optim ization of plant growth facilities System s analysis and validati on in integrated testing Advanced Environmental Monito ring and Control Autonom ous, m iniaturized, low-m ass, low- power, m ulti-use technolog ies to m onitor the crew env ironm ent Control strategies to inte grate s ensor platform s based on feedback System s validation during both nom inal and off-nom inal or transitory conditions Advanced Extravehicular Activity CO 2, hum idity and trace contam inant rem oval for life support Regenerable closed-loop therm al control Passive and active ra diation shie lding Space Human Factors Engineering Optim ization and m odeling of crew in teractions and hum an perform ance System s autom ation and improved hum an-machine inte ractio n, including inter action with inte lligent system s Advanced Hum an Support Techno logy has great im portance because m any of the challeng es in this area are potentially lim iting for the next generation of human exploration m issions. Additionally, this research addresses the effici ency of research and developm ent funding; a concern d iscussed in th e Presiden t's Managem ent Agenda. Results of this research have the potential to significan tly reduce upm ass requ irements and red uce crew tim e required for maintenance and m onitoring (see Appendix G). This provides significa nt opportunities for lowering costs and expanding crew tim e available for research. The Task Force Analys is The Task Force r ated the four AHST thrust are as as f ollows: Advanced Environmental Monito ring and Control: Priority 1. This research is a very high prio rity because of the potential for si gnificant return on i nvestm ent. Autom ated system s will free crewmem bers from frequent sys tem checks and m anaging environm ental control settings. Perform ing m aintenance as indicated by out-of-lim its conditions rather than on a set schedule would save significant crew tim e and reduce replacem ent hardware n eeds. Sm aller, lowe r mass, m ore reliable m onitors would save both upm ass and tim e. A stable and optim al environm ent will be tter sup port a ll in-flight studies in ph ysiology. A ll future spacecraft would benefit fro m this techn ology and th ere might be i mportant Earth-ba sed app lications as well. 8Specific Findings Bioastronautics Advanced Life Support: Priority 1. (Includes aspects of Gravitational Ecology) This area is a m ajor challenge for future explor ation. It would be impossible to conduct exploratory class hum an expl oration m issions taking along al l supplies and storing all wastes. A more closed loop system of recycling waste products (CO 2, dirty water, solid waste, etc.) into usable supplies will be of utmost importance. Additionally, current spacecraft s uch as the ISS and the Space Shut tle m ay use these techno logies to im prove operational efficiency. This re search could also have im porta nt Earth-based applications. Space Human Factors Engineerin g: Priority 2. Im prove ments in this area m ight have payback in increasing work productivity and d ecreasing the incidence of errors on the ISS and in future m issions. As flights lengthen, innovations in training will be needed for maintaining currency in standard and em ergenc y procedures. There is, however, a strong background of hum an factors rese arch and a great am ount of experience already available to assess needs and m ake improve ments as problem s are identified and new system s are designed. B ecause the s cience is already fair ly mature, advances in this area would not have as high an im pact as in the top prior ity areas. Advanced Extravehicular Activity: Prior ity 4. W hile res earch p rojects in th is area will allow increm ental im provem ents in the current s pacesuit, is sues of m aintainability, refurbishm ent, etc. m ay dictate an en tirely new system for exploratory m issions. However, def initive crite ria for future missions th at would guide the r esearch await the selection of specific m ission destinations a nd objectives. [It should be noted that EVA system s engineering, a separate activity from this research on funda mental advances, is perform ed in another orga nizational unit of NASA.] 9Specific Findings Fundam ental Space Biol ogy B. Fundamental Space Biology Division Description In 1999-2000 several research pr ogram s in the for mer Life Sci ences Division (notably gravitation al biology and gravitation al ecology ) were com bined to form the Fundam ental Space Biology Division of OBPR. Funda mental Space Biology ex amines how plants and anim als, including hu mans, react and adjust to the effects of different gravity levels, as well as the role of gravity in the evolution and deve lopment of terrestrial organisms and ecologica l system s. This allows rigorous and system atic determ inations of physiological re gulatory m echanisms compromised in m icrogravity as a basis for: m ore com plete understanding of basic biology, risk assessm ent for future space trav elers, and ne w approaches that enhance research enables evaluation of m icrogravity effects on lower plan t and anim al cells wh ere rapid reproduction cycles y ield perturb ations that ex trapolate to human experience. It also provides unique opportunities using non-hum an models to reduce the co mplexity of variables related to transient and long-term m icrogravity e ffects on hum ans affected. The Funda mental Space Biology them e is organized into six research thrust areas: m olecular structures and interactions, cell and molecu lar biology, organism al biology, developm ental biology, gravitational ecology, and evolutionary biology. The pr ogram relies heavily on ground- based suppo rting research, though th e ultim ate target of most of the research is space flight. The research in this area uses m olecular, cellular, system s, and wh ole-body levels of inquiry to study the long-term effects of the m icrogravity e nvironm ent on bot h sim ple (single-celled) and complex (plants and anim als) organism s. The ex tent to which research has been integrated across levels of inquiry is not fully clear but is strongly encou raged when appropriate. Because the res earch exam ines biological system s for th e long-term (including m ultiple life cycles) it requires the use of the IS S. Moreover, the resear ch depends critically on superb habitats to house model organism s that vary in biological com plexity; this \"m olecule to hum an\" approach is severely constrained by the potenti al cancellation of the plant and rodent habitats. W ithout the ability to house and study com plex system s like plants and m ammals, the utility of information obtained from isolated cell culture becom es less sure. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations Parts of this research them e have bee n analyzed extensively. Most exte rnal recomm endations for NASA's research in space biology ar e provided in the following reports: A Strategy for Research in Space Biol ogy and Medicine in the New Century , NRC, 1998 Review of NASA's Biomedical Research Program, NRC, 2000 These reports conclude that the highest prioritie s for research should be given to studies of funda mental biological processes in which gravity is known to play a direct role, and to studies concentratin g on m echanism s in combination with functional changes that are biologically and/or m edically significant. Germane tests of biom edical significance include alterations in survival, m utation, integrity, or infection. Three constituents of Fundam ental Space Biolog y were given high prio rity, and two areas (Gravitational Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) were not evaluated in the NRC reports. It 10Specific Findings Fundam ental Space Biol ogy should be noted that this discip line-based prioritization was genera ted prior to the reorganization of the Fundam ental Space Biology Division. Cell Biology : Cellular system s that are known to be aff ected by gravitational force or by other aspects of th e space env ironm ent should be em phasized. Studies of cellular m echanorecep tion should include of ch anges membrane and cytoskeletal architectu re, and analysis of pathways of response, including signal tr ansduction and resolution in time and space of possible ion transients. Studies of cellular responses to environm ental str esses encou ntered in spa ceflight should include investigation of the nature of cellular receptors, signal transduction pathways, changes in gene expression, a nd identification and structure and function analysis of stress proteins that m ediate the response. Developmental Biology : Key m odel organism s should be gro wn through two com plete life cycles in space to determ ine whether there are any critical ev ents during develo pment that are affected by space co nditions Studies should be perform ed to define th e critical periods for developm ent of the vestibu lar sy stem . Critical periods fo r cellular proliferat ion, m igration and differentiation, and apoptosis should be iden tified and the effects of m icrogravity on these pro cesses assessed. Investigations should be conducted on the influence of m icrogravity on the developm ent and m aintenance of the different neural space maps (vertebrate brains form and m aintain m ultiple neural maps of the spatial environm ent, which provide distinctive, topographical re presentations of diffe rent sensory and m otor system s), including those within the brain stem, hi ppocampus, sensory and m otor cortices, and corpus striatum . Plants, Gravity, and Space : Studies should concentrate on a few system s that would produce synergistic efforts between investigative groups. Use of a larg e number of m odels has created confusion and diluted effort. NASA is ur ged to select system s for fu ture applicatio ns that a re relevant to crop plants needed in long-duration travel. Seed-to-seed experim ents should be given top priority. This requires a superior plant growth unit. Studies of mechanism s of gravipercep tion and gravitropism in plants, using transgenic plants wherever possible, shoul d receive a high priority. Studies should include other topics in studies of m ammalian system s. Lower priority consideration should be give n to m echanis ms of gravity detection in single cells. A recurren t them e in the NRC reports was the ne cessity of adequate facility development. Experim ents depend on superior apparatus to a void confounding true gravity-related biological change with habitat effects, and prov iding high quality research facilities and equipm ent should be a high priority. 11Specific Findings Fundam ental Space Biol ogy The Task Force Analys is In ranking the research in this Division, the Task Force recognized that the reorganization of the FSB division em phasized a shift tow ard more interdisciplinary investigations, whereas the NRC reports evaluated a discipline- based organizational strategy w hose areas do not have exact homology with the current FSB research areas. Thus, elem ents of a discipline are found in several of th e current FSB research areas. For example, \"Plants, grav ity and space\" is a m ajor, but not exclusive, com ponent of both \"organis mal and com parative biology\" and \"cell and molecular biology.\" The Evolutionary Biology and Gravitational Ecology areas are newer components of the Funda mental Space Biology Divisio n developed over the last two years; hence, they were not included in the NRC reports. These areas were evaluated fro m more recent NASA-sponsored workshop reports; as the Astrobiology Program sponsored by NASA' s Office of Space Science has becom e more defined, the scope of these area s has narrowed further. Thus, the Task Force analysis in these nascen t areas is bas ed on less in formation th an the wealth of data availab le in other areas, and the Task Force recommends th at an external revi ew group revisit the prior itizatio n of these tw o areas in the future. The Task Force rated the curren t research areas as follows: Cell and Molecular Biology (com bine with elem ents of Molecular S tructures & Interaction s and Cell Science and Tissue Engineering ): Priority 1. Studies should be truly focused on the response of biological sy stem s to gravity, and not on general cell biology or molecular biology questions. Logically this should include the physical effects of space flig ht on organ isms, such as static bound ary lay er effects on gas exchange, heat transfer, and diffusion-lim ited m etabolic proces ses. Discoveries in this area have a high impact potential, and repres ent opportunities for synergy between the physical and biological sciences. Organismal and Comparative Biology : Priority 1. The investigation of the effects of microgravity on norm al physiology, m etabolism , and perform ance of mature anim als and plants, with com parison and contrast am ong di fferent organism s. Disc overies in this area are directly relevant to, and are necess ary for, hum an biom edical research and developm ent of counterm easures, and have a high im pact potential. Developmental Biology : Priority 2 . How space flight affects the d evelopment of multicellu lar organism s. Growth of pl ants and small m ammals through tw o full generations in space will be necessary to dete ct and understand critical and/or rev ersible stages in developm ent where alte red gravity has effects that change, limit, or block norm al developm ent. Effects of m icrogravity on de velopm ent of the gravity-sensing system s, such as the vestibular system , should be emphasized. A somewhat lower priority was assigned p rimarily because this research has application for hum an exploration of space only in the very distant f uture. Evolutionary Biology : Priority 4. T he ISS of fers the f irst opportunity to system atically investigate evolution ary pathways in space. The question of whether gravity drives evolution is interesting. Only sim ple, rapi d cycling biological syst ems could be utilized on ISS, and the specific hypotheses that woul d be tested experim entally are not well formulated. 12Specific Findings Fundam ental Space Biol ogy The area of Gravitation al Ecology did not earn a ranking because the Task Force found that the research questions in this area were well represented in the Envi ronm ental Health and Advanced Life Support research areas. The Task For ce therefore recom mends that Gravitational Ecology research of importance be inte grated with those p rogram s. The FSB research program requires habitats for rodents and higher plants and the centrifuge for large organism s, originally planned for incorporation on ISS in 2006 and 2008, respectively. With such a long-lead tim e, funda mental biolog y studies in the near term must focus on ground- based studies, which can provide the experim ental basis for eventu al space-based investigations. Ground based investigations also ensure the continuity of the population of high quality investigators, and foster the training of graduate and post-gr aduate students as the next genera tion o f comm itted investigato rs. Finally, the Task Force conclude d that OBPR s hould broaden the participation of high caliber researchers in the biological and biom edical sc iences into this rese arch them e (e.g., those traditionally funded by NIH and NSF). More ef fort should b e made to coordinate activities, minimizing duplication of research activ ity acros s agencies a nd reserv ing the use of s carce resources for studies where th e grav itationa l field is the key independent variable. 13Specific Findings Physical Sciences C. Physical Sciences Division C.1 Funda mental Microgravity Research C.2 Biotechnology and Applications C.3 Engineering Research Enabling Exploration There are a num ber of reasons for conducting microgravity research in the physical sciences. ISS resea rch will f orm the basis of navigation and measurem ent techno logies (clocks a nd GPS) vital for life and travel in space, and improved life on Earth. The ISS lab oratory allo ws the removal of buoyancy effects from complex reac tive-flow system s (com bustion, m ultiphase flow, granular flow, self-assembly, ...), allows extended spatial gradients and tim e scales, and allows better flow control. A microgravity environm ent provides a broader, wider, and longer window to observe and measure slow a nd very slow flow, com bustion, ki netics, phase transitions, and interfacial phenom ena - that is, processes aff ected by convection, sedim entation, and hydrostatic pressure. Som e examples of im portant phys ical sciences research in space are: Examination of the for mation of soot precu rsors (newly disco vered nanop articles ) and other pollutants that are biologica lly harmful when left unreacted. Understanding the kinetics and transport processes of cool flam es that undergo auto- ignition, and cellu lar structure of flam es and how this is related to com position, background, turbulence and chaos. Developing a way to create novel m aterials, such as clean, high-quality synthesis for ceram ics Investigation of the organizing principles of colloids, which self-assem ble and are used to study phase trans itions and fluid behavior , and are a m odel for atom ic system s. There are also biological conseque nces to th ese investig ations. To be able to leave low Earth orbit (LEO), life support technolog ies m ust be efficient, self-g enerating and self-sustaining. Microgravity fluid m echanics plays an essential role in m ost of these enabling technologies. Many of the observed physiological changes in living organism s under LEO are affected by fluid mechanics that, in turn, affects biological responses. Theref ore, fundamental m icrogravity research in the physical sciences , which is closely coupled to an alytical and num erical m odeling, enhances the potential f or understanding the resu lts from experim ents on biological system s. This OBPR division is orga nized into 3 them es: funda mental m icrogravity and research-enabling The Funda mental Microgravity Research th eme includes basic research targeting the understanding of natural processe s and taking advantage of the gr eat reduction in gravity-driven convection and sedim entation, in gravity-lim ited and in the virtual elim ination of hydrostatic pressure on the m acroscopic scal e. Possible research subject areas are phase transform ations; condensed m atter physics; quantum degenerate gases, atom ic clocks, kinetics, structure and transport; fluid stability and ental physical laws. 14Specific Findings Physical Sciences Few, if any, of the experim ents in this them e area require the long-duration exposure to the space environm ent enabled by the ISS. Ma ny could be flown on the Shuttle if access to the S huttle for science experim ents was provided. H owever, some fraction of the investigations does require extensiv e human intervention for ex perim ent adjustm ent and iteration, o r will requ ire the superior facilities and greater power available on the ISS. Those experiments should be conducted on the ISS. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations There were a num ber of well-researched previous reports available with clear recommendations, increasing the Task Force confidence that their findings would be grounded in a wealth of data from the scientific com munity. Reports found to be particularly useful were: Setting Pr iorities for Sp ace Research - Opportunities and Imperatives , NRC, 1992 Setting Priorities for Space Resear ch - An Experiment in Methodology , NRC, 1995 ISS/IMCE Task Force R eport 2001 Microgravity Research Opportunities in the 1990's, NRC, 1995 Microgravity Research in Support of Technologies for the Human Exploration and Development of Space a nd Planetary Bodies, NRC, 2000 Additionally, the NRC Comm ittee for Microgravity Research is in the process of conducting a review of research program s in the Physical Sciences Division, of wh ich this are a of research is a major com ponent. The results of this review are expected to be av ailable by Septem ber 2002. While unable to share prelim inary findings with th e Task Force, Dr. Peter Voorhees, Chair of the NRC Committe e, outline d the objec tives of the on-goi ng rev iew and highlighted some of the best research results to have com e out of this progra m to date. An exciting example is the f irst-ever stabilization of fla me balls. These are sphe rical nonpropagating fla mes, predicted by Zeldovich3 in 1944, but not observed until p roduced in the Mi crogravity Science L aborato ry-1 flights (STS - 83 and STS-94) aboard the Space Shuttle in 1997 . These reports are unanimous in the assertion that NASA should support long-term , fundam ental research of the highest quality. Reports 4 and 5 specif ically call ou t the following areas of high prior ity: Fluid Mech anics and Transport Phenomena: Research al enom ena. Combustio n: Highest priority is sp acecraft fire safety. Other im portant areas are turbulen t combustion, lam inar pre mixed and diffusion flam es, and sprays, because of technological significance on Earth. Materia ls Science and Processing: Nucleation kinetics and achievem ent of m and as the test of the equivalen ce of inertia l and gravitation al mass; critical phenom ena, including reduced- dimensional and dynam ic studies, and atom ic clocks. 3 Zeldovich, Ya. B., The ory of Com bustion and Detonation of Gases, Academ y of Sciences (USSR), 1944. 15Specific Findings Physical Sciences The ISS/IMCE Task Force report \"is unanim ous th at the high est research prior ity sho uld be solving prob lems with long-duration hum an space flight, including the en gineering required for human support.\" Som e of the research in th is program may apply, particularly combustion research app lied to spacecraft fire saf ety, and su rface tens ion-driven flows , capillary ef fects as well as m ultiphase flow research can be dire ctly applied to propul sion and power system s, but the bulk of Funda mental Microgravity Research is not on the critical path for supporting hum an spaceflight. The Task Force Analys is Microgravity Physics. Priority 1* (see below for defini tion). This them e area (including the OBPR identified thrust areas of condensed matter; fundam transf ormation4; fluid ics; kinetic s, structure and tr ansport; and energy conversion) includes a num ber of excellent projects in sm all, single investigator physics: flame balls, fluidics, phase transitions5, and granular flows are exam ples. Other current areas of interest are cold atom s, Bos e-Einst ein condensation and degenerate Ferm i gases; and atom ic clocks. These studies should be considered as part of a single program in microgravity physics encom passing research of the m ost fundam entally important scientific problem s. It would be inappropriate for the Task Fo rce to prioritize am ong the projects which lie within this thrust area. F urtherm ore, on the ba sis of scientif ic quality alon e, the work in funda mental m icrogravity cannot be differentia ted from work in other areas such as biology. The biom edical th eme areas given a priority 1 ranking address m ajor issues for the hum an exploration of space while m ost of the phys ical sciences theme areas do n ot. As a consequence, the physical sciences w orking group discussed the pr iority assignm ent for the physical sciences them e areas at length cons idering a ranking of prio rity 1 or priority 2. The priority 1* ranking conveys the conclusi on that these areas c ontain projects that deserve a priority 1 ranking base d on scientific merit alone, but that m any of them lack a direct connection with h uman space explora tion. Of course, those physical science projects th at im pact human space exp loration di rectly shou ld g. Thermo-physical, phys ical-chemical properties: Priority 3. Much previous work has already been perform ed in this area. Specifi c expectations for m ajor advances using the microgravity environm ent are not well docum ented. Some of this work is purely knowledge driven, w ith no apparent connection to the m ore applied NASA m issions. Som e, for exam ple flam e balls and fluid m echanics, connect directly to a legitim ate concern for astronaut safety (flamm ability) or spacecraft operation (pum ping liquid fuels). Both types of research are appropriate. H owever, for th e purely knowledge driven it is even m ore essential for NASA to ensure that onl y excellent research is ch osen, and th at the highest qu ality researchers are recruited. The be st/most succes sful work in this area has been and will be hypothesis d riven; that is , research on long duratio n exposure to m icrograv ity used to test specific, very well defined hypotheses ba sed on extensive ground-based research. 4 See App endix J no te #10 5 See App endix J no te #9 16Specific Findings Physical Sciences C.2 Biotechnology & Application s Description The Biotechnology and Applications them e is composed of the m ore applied research sponsored within the P hysical Sciences Division. The research is focused on hardware and system s developm ent for biological research in m icrograv ity, including tissue engin eering capability, as well as focused research for Earth-based and spac e-based app lications Th e them e encom passes five distinct areas of research: physical effects in ce ll science and tissue engi neering; structural biology; energy conversion and chemical processi ng; synthesis and processing; and bioinspired and m icrofl uidics technologies. Both the Cell Science and Tissue Engineering an d Structural Biology rese arch thrusts contain research elem ents that require the IS S envir onment. Energy Conversion m ay not require the long-duratio n exposure to space, but som e experi ments m ay require the multip le iterations and adjustm ents m ade possible in a hum an tended environm ent. For m aterials synthesis and process ing, gravitation al processes play a m ajor role in con trolling the reactions, po rosities and morphologies of products, but agai n, the long-duration requirem ent is not clear. There is no clear role for the m icrogravity environm ent in bioinspired and m icroflu idics technologies. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations The prim ary report referred to for this analysis was: Future Biotechnology Research on the International Space Station , NRC, 2000 The cell science and tissue engineering and struct ural biology com ponents of this research them e area have been reviewed thoroughly, with prim ary recomm endations in the above docum ent. The other areas covered in this OBPR them e have been less extensively reviewed. Task Force conclusion s in these areas are not made with the sam e level of confidence as those based on a wealth of data from the scientif ic co mmunity. Cell Scienc e The cell science and tissue engineering program focuses on perturbations encountered by cells as a consequence of the transition to microgravity environm ents. The principal goal of the ground based and microgravity research is to gain necessary understanding for the cellular basis of human adaptation to space. In addition to expanding the knowledge base of m icrogravity influences on cell structure and function, the pr ogram has the potential, in a broad biological context, to have significant im pact on cell science and tissue engineering. The NRC Task Group recommend that narrowing th e broad sweep of the current cell science program may focus instrum ent developm ent effort s and accelerate p rogress. Lim itations that were identified in NASA-funded ground based st udies and ex perim ents carried ou t on Shuttle missions were to a large extent attrib uted to duration of flights and av ailability of space and equipm ent. These lim itations will be, to a signif icant extent, allev iated b y the ISS. The NRC also concluded that appropriate experim ental co ntrols for sp ace-based cell ents not yet been determ ined, and research shou ld be m ore closely c oordinated with the life sciences areas of OBPR's research portfoli o. Finally, the NRC concluded that NASA should 17Specific Findings Physical Sciences broaden outreach to in crease the participati on of the science comm unity and the num ber of excellent outstanding research in vestigations proposed. NASA and NIH collaborations, through joint devel opment of a Center for Three-Dim ensional Tissue Culture, have yielded new options for cell and tissue propagation in areas that h ave been refracto ry to traditional approaches. A recent program review at that center found that it has been highly successful at attract ing a num ber of excellent rese archers to us e the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreacto r (NASA tissue cultu re tec hnology). Involvem ent of NIH scientists in NASA-oriented research has enhanced the resear ch by NASA scientists. Continuation of such research sho uld involve joint experiments on the Space Statio n that cou ld be perform ed and monitored u sing devic es operated at the NIH f acilities Structural Biology The NRC re view of NASA's structural biology res earch was initiated in part because of past criticism s of the program (NASA Pos ition [Spring 1998], The American Society for C ell Bio logy, http://www.ascb.org/pub licpolicy/nasareport.htm l). The NRC Task Gr oup solicited opinions, both in person and in writing, from a wide cross- section of scientists who use crystallographic techniques for m acrom olecular structure s tudies , heard reports from NASA scientists and engineers concerned with the program and m ade two site visits to laboratories involved in instrum entation developm ent. The NRC Task Group concluded that the program has had very lim ited impact on structural biology to date. The NRC Task Group found \"The results from the collection of experim ents perform ed on m icrogravity' s effect on protei n cry stal growth are incon clusive. The improvem ents in c rystal quality that have been observed a re often only in crem ental, a nd the difficulty of producing the appropriate controls lim it investigators' ability to definitively assess if improve ments can be reliably credited to the m icrogravity environm ent. To date, the impact of microgravity crystallization on structural biolog y as a whole has been extrem ely lim ited.\" The members of the NRC Ta sk Group were very im pressed by the prototype of the autom ated hardware developed under NASA grants for grow ing, selecting and cryo-preserving crystals. Recognizing that the Space Shuttl e is not the optimu m environ ment for these studies, it was the consensus o f the NRC Task Group that the p rogram be allowed to contin ue on the IS S until such time as its usefulness can be further assessed. Specifically, the NRC Ta sk Group recomm ended: \"At present, the prim ary goal of NASA' s prot ein crystal growth program should be to demonstrate m icrogravity' s effect on protein crystal growth and to determ ine whether studies of macrom olecula r assemblies with im portant biol ogical im plications will be advanced by use of the m icrogravity environm ent. To this e nd, the task group proposes that NASA instigate a high-profile, nation-wide series of grants to supp ort research ers engaging in sim ultaneous efforts to get both the best possible crystal on the ground and the best possible crystal in space of biologically im portant m acrom olecules. The pr ojects funded by these grants should address the uncertainties that have plagued the NASA pr otein crystal growth program , by using the ISS for a reliable, long-term microgravity enviro nment, by com paring space-grown crystals to the best ground crystals, and by focusing on cha llenging system s and hot s cientific problem s. Their results should definitively sho w whether th e use of m icrograv ity can produce crystals of a higher quality than tho se grown using the best technologies availab le on Earth. If non e of the projects produces a space-grown crystal th at enables a b reakthrough for the structure 18Specific Findings Physical Sciences determ ination of a biologically im portant m acromolecular assem bly, then NASA should be prepared to term inate its protei n crystal growth program . Howeve r, if the projects supported by this high -profile, nationwide serie s of grants succeed in va lidating the use of crysta llization in microgravity to tackle im portant and ch allenging problem s in biology, dem and for the facilities on the ISS can be expected to incr ease.\" - from Exe cutive Summ ary (page 8). The Task Force Analys is The Task Force gave the following priority rankings for elem ents of this them e: Structural Biology - Priority 3. The program to date has had a very lim ited im pact on structural biology. The prototype-autom ated ha rdware developed is im pressive. It is important th at this progr am attem pt to re solve the issue of whether the m icrograv ity environm ent can be a valuable tool; therefor e the Task Force strongly endorses the NRC recomm endation quoted above in the m eta-analysis. Materia ls Synthesis & Processing - Priority 4. Prim arily ground-based research with some relevance, particularly in the area of nanomaterials. However, the T ask Force felt this area has lower poten tial for NASA's space-research po rtfolio than m any areas reviewed. Bioinspired and Microfl uidics Technologies - Recomm end NASA cons ider term ination. The cross-disciplinary program was designed to integrate physical a nd biological sciences and strengthen NASA-wide t echno logy develop ment to enable new cap abilitie s for the full and effective u tilization of ISS research faci lities. Howev er, the re is n o clear role f or the m icrogravity environm ent in this resear ch or clear priority NASA/OBPR fundi ng. Additionally, the Task F orce recomm ends that th e Cell Science and Tissue Engineering research be program matically integrated with Cell and Molecular Biology research in the Fundam ental Space Biolo gy Division. The capabilities develo ped in the cell science an d tissue-engineering area are essential for m uch of the fundam ental bi ology research. A cogent case can be m ade that organism al studies are necessary to obta in understanding of a m icrogravity im pact on physiological function. Yet, to m echanistical ly address m icrogravity -linked perturbations requires pursuit of problem s at the cellular leve l. Exploring influences of m icrogravity on organism s and cells need not be m utually exclus ive. Rather, these app roaches are co mpatible, synergistic and a viable basi s for research integration. The Task Force also recommends that the Energy Conversion research be integrated with the other basic m icrogravity research in the Division. The program addresses im portant scientific questions that include the im portance of low te mperature chem istry on autoignition, the interplay between flam e structure and convection on the s oot growth process, the interaction between turbulent flam elets and the environm ent, and th e effects of solutal cap illary effects on the burning rate of fuel droplets. The program has a successful track record th at it ref lected by m ajor contributions in com bustion research, but is fundam entally sim ilar in approach to the other sm all physics investigations supported by the Division. 19Specific Findings Physical Sciences C.3 Engine ering Research Enabling Exploration Description Engineering Research E nabling Exp loration em phasizes fund amental and applied eng ineering research specific to th e design and en gineering of space-based system s enabling hum an exploration of space. Specific subjects of interest include fire safety and fluid system engineering, technologies for propulsion and power, radiation protec tion, m ission resource production, and biom olecular syst ems technology and sensors. Very little o f this research specifically requi res lo ng-duration access to the space environm ent. Much of the research can be perform ed in gr ound-based facilities and some research requiring access to sp ace could be perform ed on the Shuttle. However, som e investigation s (for exam ple, the tes ting o f fire safety or propuls ion and power system s) will requ ire the superio r facilities and greate r power available on the ISS, or will require hum an intervention f or exper iment adjustm ent and iteration. These experim ents should be flown on the ISS. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations There were a num ber of well-researched previous reports available with clear recommendations, increasing the Task Force confidence that their findings would be grounded in a wealth of data from the scientific com munity. The prim ary reports used in this analysis were: Microgravity Research O pportunities for the 1990 , NRC, 1995 Microgravity Research in Support of Technologies for the Human Exploration and Development of Space a nd Planetary Bodies, NRC, 2000 The funda mental phenom ena affected or dom inant in reduced gravity have been identified and high-priority research areas have been recomm ended. The specific areas identified for high priority research are: Surface or interfacial p henomena (effects stemm wetting and interf acial te nsion) Multiphase flow and he at transfer (referring to the flow of more than one fluid phase in pipes, pum ps, and phase change components, and the flow in porous m edia, exem plified by the flow of fluids in the packed and fl uidized particulate beds used in chem ical reacto rs) Multiphase system dyn amics (deals with th e global in stabilities th at may occur in multiphase system s) Fire phenomena (fire detection and suppression on boa rd, also relating to som e power generation and propulsion system s) Granular materials (referring to s uch topics as the re sponse of granular m edia and soils to geotechnical loads and the flow of gr anular materials in chutes and hoppers) Solidif ication and melting (referring to the phase change of a liquid to a solid, as occurs in casting or welding) In addition, the report lists recomm endations for using ISS to conduct long-duration microgravity scien tific research and assess ing th e efficiency and suitability of m any of the system s and subsystem s important to hu man and robotic exploration in space. 20Specific Findings Physical Sciences The research directly ad dresses challenges at the interface b etween the ph ysical scien ces, engineering, and integrated system s for hum an expl oration in space. This research supports the long-duratio n (~ 20 years into th e future) vision o f NASA for space explo ration. The funda mental research in multiphase f low and h eat transfer that has been recommended in the second report is directly relevant to engineer ing research enabling expl oration in system s for propulsion and power, for therm al managem ent of fluid system s, in spacecraft enviro nment as well as for crew comfort, and for m ission resour ce production. As a concrete exam ple of the intersection between interfacial phenom ena and multiphase f low boiling heat transfer can be identified. Flow boilin g is the s implest reliab le means for circum venting the enorm ous bubble growth problem s in m icrogravity, for greatly reducing system size and weight, for achieving order-of-m agnitude increase in he at transfer corresponding to m odest increases in temperature, for rem oving bubbles from the surface before th ey grow sig nificantly o r coalesce with neighboring bubbles, and for ensuring adequate liquid replenishm ent. The report considered the use of ISS for perform ing som e of the long-term research that had been recommended. Although multiphase f low and heat transf er cou ld be pe rformed on the Shuttle, the ISS of fers an ideal opportunity for these typ es of experim ents b ecause sufficient power would be available. The benefits of the m icrogravity res earch th at can be provided by the ISS \"laboratory\" include, but are not lim ited, to advancem ent of f unda mental knowledge of com plex phenom ena and processes, design and operation of various en gineered systems (e.g., for power production, fluid and therm al manage ment, environm ental control, etc.) for exp loration and developm ent, and developm ent of new m aterials and processes. The Task Force Analys is The Task Force rank ed the thrus ts in this th eme area as follo ws: Technologies for Prop ulsion and Pow er Systems: Priority 1. Propulsion and power should be ranked first for enabling explorat ion of the Moon, Mars and planetary bodies outside the solar system . Without advan ced propulsion system s and power sources, human exploration beyond LEO (M ars) will be impossible. Advanced propulsion system s are needed to reduce the duration of flights to other planetary bodies. An exam ple of s uch a propulsion system is the m agnetoplasm adyna mic rocket that accelerates charged particles using m agnetic fields. The m agnetic fi eld inte racts with the gas to acce lerate gas particles, thereby creatin g rocket thru st. Hydrogen, lith ium or argon can b e used as propellant g ases. NASA jointly with the space agencies of Germ any, Ja pan and Russia are developing other advanced propulsion systems. Electric p ower needed by the spacecraft is generated b y photovoltaic fuel cells , as is th e case in ISS, and com es from inciden t solar radiation, but for long-durati on flig hts, beyond Mars, so lar irradiation w ill be inadequate because of increasing d istance s from the sun, and other energy sources will have to be developed for use. Fire Safety and Fluid Systems Eng ineering: Priority 2. Although an initial and acceptab le fire safety sys tem has been im plem ented on ISS, there are still som e very funda mental com bustion and fire safety issues that need to be addressed to im prove fi re safety for the crew. For exam ple, gravity eff ects in sm oldering, as in the case of electrical cable fires, is a fire safety issue that need s to be addressed as th ere could be production and propagation of hazardous or flamm able pr oducts that could im pact fire and crew safety in a s pacecraft. 21Specific Findings Physical Sciences Radiation Protection: Priority 3. Radiation protection is prim arily an engineering issue (solution). New m aterials and techniques for radiati on shielding need to be developed for long-duration hum an exploration beyond LEO, but radiation protection, as opposed to radiation health, is less critical as a fundam ental research prior ity. It should be noted that much of this research could be done in ground-based facilities. Mission Resource Pro duction and Robotic Exploration: Priority 4. A long-duration mission to Mars would require production of resources such as oxygen, or propellants from the Martian regolith. W ithout proven in -situ resource utili zation and processing system s, long-duration h uman exploration of Ma rs will not b e possible. H owever, oth er alternatives are ava ilable for initial, s hort-du ration exploration con cepts. A num ber of mission resource production concepts have b een advanced and ISS could provide a platform for testing the technologies. Biomolecular systems technology and sensors : Priority 4. I n spite of the fact that su ch technology and sensors m ay be ve ry relevant to NASA's m ission in space, for im proving the health an d safety of hum ans livin g and working in space, with lim ited resources NASA cannot effectively com pete with the p rivate secto r and agencies such as DARPA and NIH, who are already funding research in this area. It should be noted that this research is p erform ed in ground-based facilities. 22Specific Findings Research Integration D.

P.L. 98-361 (1984) \"declares th at the general welfare of the United States requires that the National Aeronautics and Space Adm inistration seek and encourage, to th e maximum extent pos sible, the fullest comm ercial use of space.\" Comm ercial Act (P.L. 105-303) \"declares that free and com petitive m arkets create the m ost efficient conditions for prom oting econom ic devel opment, and should therefore govern the econom ic developm ent of Earth orbital space.\" Therefore, the Task Fo rce recognizes that the 1 998 Comm ercial Space Act established as public polic y the commercial use of ISS and NA SA's role as a facilitato r to utilize ISS for comm ercial purposes. The Task Force also recognized that it is not appr opriate to apply entirely the sam e research m erit criteria to the Comm ercial Applied S ciences a nd Comm ercial Engineering Research and Technology Developm ent them es as were developed for Funda mental Biology, Bioastronautics and Funda mental Microgravity. The Task Force did assign priority rating s to the commercial a reas and did use the resea rch m erit criteria, but the prog rams are also evaluated by other r eview comm ittees, using ad ditiona l criteria appropriate to commercial activity. These differences arise f rom the basic concept up on which the commercial progr ams are structu red, as compared to the science program s. Comm ercial program priorities are established in response to private sector interest and investm ent. Su ch priorities are dynam ic in nature and can change as a function of the market's perception of v alue of the s pace res earch product. Additionally , commercial space research reflects the c ompetitive a dvantage en visioned a s a return on the investm ent being m ade in space resea rch ac tivitie s. From a macro-perspectiv e, commercial space research activity contribu tes to nation al econom ic growth through increased flow of i mproved products and services . This in turn contri butes to the GNP, to the strengthening of hum an cap ital, and in fostering new generations of skilled workers. These facto rs provide th e justification for NASA's role in m itigating, but no t elim inating, the high risk s presen tly confronting the comm ercial sector in regard to suppor ting space research as a venue for private investm ent and product developm ent. The availab ility of ISS as a perm anent presen ce in space will go a long way toward am eliorating the risk factors faced in the past. Thus, it is reasonable to expect th at as the current R&D proje cts transitio n into the m arketplace as com mercial prod ucts and serv ices, th e need for NASA subsidized funding will decreas e and eventually disappear. D.1 Commercial Applied Sciences Description In partia l fulfillment of its comm ercial m andate, NASA estab lished the ied a s the Comm ercial Space Centers (CSC's). centers were estab lished follo wing com petitive, peer- reviewed procedures in 1985, 1986, and 1987. Subsequently , som e of these centers w ere term inated and 23Specific Findings Research Integration others were com petitively added. The research area of each center was d efined in the proposal subm itted for the com petitiv e peer-reviewed evaluation. One criterion us ed in these evaluations w as whether the proposal represented a high priority research area as defi ned by NASA and other organization s involved in identifying space research need s. The funda mental p remise on which the CSC's function is based on industry- driven research. Consequently, specific investigations at the Centers are defined and conducted join tly by industry and center personnel. Current research th rusts in the CSC's include b iotechnology (prim arily developm ent and processing. Comm ercial investigations, in many cases, require long-duration e xperimental tim es as can only be provided by ISS. In addition, com mercial rese arch requires repetiti on or iteration of the experim ents so as to confirm results of previous e xperim ents. This is par ticularly important to a commercial organization that is using the space in vestigations in their developm ent of a new product or service. The commercia l investigations util ize hardware developed specifically to minimize, but not exclu de, the need for ISS crew interv ention to com plete the experiment protocol. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations Comm ercial Space Centers are rev iewed on approxim ately a 3-year tim e fram e. The review teams included m embers with technical expertise in the ar ea specific to the research being conducted at the center, and m embers with f inancia l expertise to veri fy the co mmercial an d business p otential of the joint industry/academ ia research program . Those reviews considered m ost relevant for the Comm ercial Applied Sciences were: A Review of the Centers for the Commerc ial Development of Space; Concepts and Operation, NAPA, 199 4 The International Space Station Commercialization Study, Potom ac Institute for Policy Studies, 1997 Reflections on the Commercial Space Center (CSC) Program, NAP A, 1998 NASA: Commerce on th e International Space Station, KPMG Report, 1999 Future Biotechnology Research on the International Space Station, NRC, 2000 X-ray Crystallography Facility at the Center for Biophysical Scienc es and Engineering, University of Alaba ma at Birm ingham, prepared by an external review panel comm issioned by NASA managem ent, 2000 All these reviews acknowledged that the research conducted in the Comm ercial Applied Sciences, identified as 1) Biotechnology, 2) Ag ribusiness, and 3) Advanced Materi als, was based on scientifically accepted m ethodology and reflected areas of eco nomic inte rest to th e ind ustry partners. The reviews recomm end that th e indu stry partners place great er em phasis on increased financial co mmit ments. These reviews also pointed out that the long-lead times involved in the realization of return on investm ent by the industry partner, unpredictable sc heduling of space access for the research, an d high integration and launch co sts all present significant negative impacts on how m uch of an industry financial co mmit ment is m ade at this stage of the space prog ram. 24Specific Findings Research Integration NASA's commercial program has supported the developm ent of m any different types of apparatus for macrom olecular crystallization exp eriments on Sp ace Shuttle and potentially on ISS. All require minimal crew intervention and several have had extens ive flight-testing. Crystal lization techniques that have been investigated include passive and dynamically controlled vapor diffusion, gel diffusion, and liquid-liquid diffusion. Devices for exam ining crystal nucleation by lase r light scattering and phase-shift interferom etry have also been developed. The m embers of the NRC Task Group were im pressed by the prototype XC F (X-ray Crystallography Facility) and recomm ended that it be further developed for flight on I SS. It is an integrated, highly autom ated system , which includes crystal growth, re mote microscope inspection and selection, crystal cryo-preserv ation and sto rage as well as the poss ibility of lim ited on-site x-ray diffraction studies. The XCF allows for the handling of large num bers of sa mples and m ay experim ents. Cryo- preserving fresh crystals on-site was deem ed by the NRC task group to be essential. T he XCF evalua tion p anel rated th is capab ility at a pr iority hi gher than that of obtaining diffraction data in orbit. NASA has been successful in buildin g a commun ity in crystallizati on. Sp ace m issions have involved sm all quantities of m aterials and relatively simple apparatus. T his program might be a model for the other focused areas of technology de velopm ent, which are less m ature. However, the slow tu rn-around tim e in space is a m ajor issue for comm ercially viable research. This is a problem that NASA m ust address. The Task Force Analys is This program addresses the national comm itment to develop the comm ercial potential of space. Some Task Force m embers expressed a concer n that the re sults em anatin g from such investigations m ay not be justified on a cost/ benef it basis. However, in view of the nature of access to sp ace in the past that negatively im pacted opportun ities for com mercial and science research, it is not possib le to m ake an accurate co st/ben efit an alyses at th is time. Many of these negative impacts will be elim inated with the availabili ty of ISS and this should allow for the conduct of effective cost/benefit an alyses in the future. There is an historical analogy with commercial use of synchrotron fac ilities for diffraction studies. Af ter the u sefulness of the la tter technology was establis hed and the governm ent comm itted to the cons truction of very expensive third -generation synch rotrons, a larg e num ber of pharm iotechnology co mpanies made an ongoing inves tment, now i n excess of $20 m illion, to build b eamlines. The Task Force rated the three areas as follows: Biotechnology: Priority 3. Although there is de monstrated success in building a commercial user comm unity and in the developm ent of advanced technology for microgravity crystallizations, som e task group mem bers expressed doubt about the commercial viability of the program . However, there is a coun ter argument in the commercial participa tion in the bu ilding of synchrotron beam lines. The combination of better ordered crystals from microgravity, cryo-preservation and the use of synchrotron radiation can all be expected to contribute to the higher re solution diffraction data which will be c rucial in m any struc tural studies. I t is important th at this p rogram attem pt to resolve the issue of whethe r the m icrogravity environm ent can be a valuable tool, therefore the Task Force endor ses the NRC recomm endation: \"NASA should fund a series of high-profile grants to support research that uses micrograv ity to produce crystals of 25Specific Findings Research Integration macromolecular assemb lies with imp ortant implications for c utting-edge biology problems. The success or failure of these re search efforts would definitely resolve the issue of whether the microgravity environmen t can be a valuable tool for researchers and would determine the future of the NA SA protein crystal growth program.\"6 Agribusines s: Priority 4. Areas of research include enhanced gene transfer in microgravity and gravitational effects on plant structure and com position. The concern is that the valu e of the research m ay not just ify the costs as sociat ed with accessing the microgravity environm ent. Advanced Materials: Priority 4. The consens us was that the activity d escrib ed as requiring IS S for m easurem ent of the rmophysi cal properties of alloys and the zeolite crystal research m ay represent v iable commerc ial space activ ities. The oth er areas m ay be of questionable comm ercial v alue w hen com pared to the cos t of access to space. Other activity appears to require additional ground based experim entation prior to being considered for scheduling on the ISS . D.2 Commercial Engineering Research & Technology Development Description A core characteristic of this program is that all of the testbeds and instruments are developed with private funds. NASA's comm itment to the co mmercial partners is both availability of the attach po int on the ISS and a carrier that allo ws transport up and down, plus required crew tim e for attachm ent and servicing. The carrier is being planned under an international partner arrangem ent with Brazil. NASA's goal is to ad vance the program to the point where the industry partner bears the full cost of the ISS access and utilization. Investm ents are being m ade by both large and small com panies in rem ote sensing and autom ated s; telecomm power generation, storage and distribution; robotics and structures; and propulsion. Virtually the entire Comm ercial Engineering Research & Technology Developm ent program will be conducted using the external (non-pressurized) pa llets and truss of the ISS. The ISS offers the advantages of an ability to acces s and servic e the equipm ent on a regula r basis in o rder to exam ine the experim ental resu lts, reconfigure the testbed, and re trieve the experim ent. Crew time is involved only during the tim e the experiment al unit is being attach ed to ISS and when it is retrieved. During other tim es the expe rimental unit would f unction autonom ously. Meta-Analysis of Previous Reports and Recommendations The commercial aspects of NASA's program for e ngineering research and technology developm ent on ISS are derived from the report: Engineering Research a nd Technolo gy Develop ment on the Space Statio n, NRC, 1996 6 Future Biotechnology Resea rch on the International Space Station, Spac e Studies Boa rd, National Re search Council, 2000. page 8. 26Specific Findings Research Integration The report emphasized that reduc ing costs and improving perform ance of future governm ent and commercial activ ities in space will require co ntinuing engineering research and techn ology developm ent (ERTD). Som e other conclusions of the report are: The ISS will be a valuab le location for in-sp ace E RTD A major goal should be to reduce operations and m aintenance costs of the ISS through infusion of new technology NASA should determ ine which m odifications of the ISS to support ERTD should be given a high priority A pilot prog ram using multid iscip linary exper t review to help com panies develop and commercialize new technologies should be considered A roadm ap for ERTD on the ISS should be developed that links NASA with other agencies, academ ia, and industry NASA should establish a single organization to work with researchers in terested in conducting ERTD experim ents on the ISS and other space p latform s ERTD on the ISS should prom ote the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers. The Task Force Analys is The six comm ercial research areas w ere assigne d, as a group, a priority score of 2, largely because th e am ounts of money being invested b y the priv ate partners are substantial. The rationale for assigning the sam e priority score to all six of the research areas was that industry commit ment in the area of interes t is based on what the com pany perceives as the N et Presen t Value of the resulting product. Additionally, since the research is proprietary, it was not possible for the Task Force to review it in any depth. It was decided that industry should set the priorities based on their willingness to invest, and that a further differentiation in priorities would be inappropriate. The Comm ercial Engineering Research & Technol ogy Developm ent (ERTD) effort that has been developed is based on th e cooperativ e inputs of both industry and academ ia. The prog ram responds to six of the nine reco mmendations given in the NRC report. All of the identified ERTD areas require the space enviro nment to de termine the long-term effects on th e system s being evalu ated for use in space. Ind ustry pa rticipants cons ider the ISS a highly des irable testbed b ecause it allows for regul ar access and reconfiguration or replacem ent of an experim ent or subsystem as the results m ay indicate. 27Specific Findings Priorities across Di visions 2.2 Task Force Priorities across OBPR Divisions Basis for pr ioritiz ation of resea rch across OBP R Divisions Reports by hundreds of expert opinions outsi de N ASA involving m any hours of review of individual research projects within NASA divisions from (see Appendix D). NASA-presented background on the program The m erit cr iteria dev eloped by OBPR and m odified by ReMAP were used to evaluate research within the 4 O BPR divisions (see Appendix K). Rationale for prioritization articulated by the Task Force as important determ ining the pr portfolio (see Appendix L). Interpreta tion of priority rankings : The assignm ent of priorities by ReMAP (shown below) was done at the level of OBPR research them es and not at the level of individual research projects. The ranking of priority 1 to a given th eme area constitu tes ou r statem ent th at the re are very im portant research questions within th is research them e, and does not suggest a blanket end orsem ent of all th e projects with in an area. Prioritiz ation within eac h resea rch th eme requires the eva luation of specific res earch projects and productivity of individual Principal Investigator s. This effort was outside of the scope of ReMAP. Final Task F orce cross-them e ranking of research priorities for OBPR 28Specific Findings Priorities across Di visions High prior ity resea rch falls into tw o categor ies The high priority research identified by the Task Force falls into two broad, som etimes overlapping goals.7 Addresses q uestions of intrins ic scientific merit (including those which might im prove the hum an condition on earth) that cannot be accom plished in a terrestrial environm ent: Obtains info rmation necessary to en able human exploration of space beyond low-earth orbit, and d evelops ef fective coun termeasures to itigate the potentially d amaging effects of long-term exposur e to the space enviro nment. Some research contributes to both goals. Categories of Highest Priority Research [This schematic does not im ply strict adhe rence of projects to a specific category.] The Task Force wres tled with the question of whether any further prioritization was possible; in particular, whether it is currently possible to place one of these broad goals at a higher priority than the o ther. In the history of the United States sp ace progr am both broad goals have b een im portant, though their relative im portance has changed over tim e. The lim ited am ount of biological and physical research that occurred du ring early sp ace explo ration, particularly th e Apollo era, focused on the health and safety of astronaut crews in a m icrogravity env ironment. Significant research questions that did not co ntribute directly to a successful m oon landing re ceived lower priority. In contrast, more regular acces s to s pace provid ed by the Sh uttle afforded an opportu nity for \"basic\" research to take higher priority. The exp ansion of space-based research in the physical and biological sciences over the past twenty years is a testam ent to th is fact. This sugg ests th at 7 Excluding commercial program, whi ch is of a fundam entally differe nt nature 29Specific Findings Priorities across Di visions one goal can receiv e higher prio rity over the o ther, but th is ranking m ay shift depend ing on the programm atic needs of NASA at an y particular point in tim e. The Task Force recognizes the ISS is a truly rem arkable facility that can be used to tackle either broad goal. However, the Task Force also believes that, while NASA's new Vision and Mission clearly articulate hum an explora tion beyond LEO at som e point in time, it is not yet known whe n such exploration m ight take place. A possible decision tree, reflecti ng programm atic decision points that would affect res earch priority outcom es is shown in the figure below. Decision Tree: Programm atic Decisi ons Affecting Research Priorities Fine tuning of order of carrying out highest priority re search thrust areas requires knowledge of time frame for future long-duration hum an expl oration, This dictates which agency goal (enabling hum an exploration of sp ace or answerin g questions of intrins ic scientif ic merit) takes precedence in the era of the ISS. If a decision were m ade to develop a near-t erm hum an exploration m ission, NASA's research would necessarily have a strong em phasis on so lving the nu merous challenges to further hum an exploration on an accelerated s chedu le (Focus Set 'B'). Ho wever, if further hum an exploration were deferred to the very long term , research of intrinsic scientific m erit and the sub-set of enabling res earch specifically to im prove the effi ciency and capabilities of the ISS and the health of its crew would take precedence (Focus Set 'C '). Focus Set 'D' would be a balan ce between work of intrinsic sc ientif ic merit and r esearch to enable the next genera tion of hum an exploration missions, allowing NASA to keep open the option of further hum an exploration in the not-too- distant future. 30Specific Findings Priorities across Di visions Once the NASA ti me frame for human exploration of space is determ ined, research p riorities that solve near-term problem s can be distingu ished from those that solve very long term problem s. Because th e deciding factors for the n ext step are programm atic, rather than scientific in nature, the Task Force did not attempt further prior itizatio n. 31Specific Findings Findings on Science P roductivity 2.3 Findings on Science Productivity in OBPR and on the ISS Histo ric View of Prioritiz ation Context for Developm ent of OBPR Research Program The OBPR r esearch program s evolved in the absence of stable budgets and predictable f light access. Prioritization of research que stions of OBPR ha s not been possible in this context. Previous External Reports NASA's Space Research Program has been rev iewed m any tim es. Consecutive reports hav e generally reached th e same major conclusions. OBPR Research Platfo rms The OBPR r esearch p elem ents that: Require ISS ISS is optim al but not necessary Can be addr essed using the Shuttle Can be addressed using free flyers Can be addressed in ground-based research ISS Capabi lities Unique Research Capab ilities of the ISS: Long duration flight with Hum ans to perform expe riments and operate equipm ent Hum ans as subjects Reasonable tim e frame for iterative studies: Frequent access Experim ent repetition State-of-the-art on-orbi t laborato ry facilities ISS Biological Research Needs a Centrifuge The Task Force encourages expedited devel opment of the centrifuge with appropriate external review and guidance to ensure tim ely deploym ent. The ISS centrifuge serves two essential res earch f unctions in the biological sciences: It provides a rigorous in-flight contro l condition with a centrifugal field where gravity-driven forces can act, and It produces a variab le gravity field to iden tify th reshold-loading condition s that m ight facilitate b iologica l proc esses. Engineering aspects of the centrifuge are largely resolved Current eng ineering an alysis ind icates th at the centrifuge will not violate ISS microgravity requirem ents. If necessary, centrifuge use could be sche duled to elim inate (c urrently unforeseen) interactions with ents. 32Specific Findings Findings Science P roductivity OBPR Organi zation OBPR orga nization, program structure, and solicitation m echanism s: are based on research discipline, lack a strategic approach, are not op timal for identif ication an d implementation of high pr iority/high impact research. Strateg ic approach m ay identify: Expected outcom es Roadm ap to achieving goals Most effective organization to achieve goals Appropriate m echanics for solicitatio ns Appropriate modes for research (e.g., team approach or single investigator) Need for sunset condition on research projects Need for Commercial Research Public Law 105-330 establishes as public po licy the comm ercial use of the ISS, and NASA's role in facilitating this use. The Task Force used the resear ch m erit criteria developed. Evaluation of the comme rcial program s required additional criteria appropriate for commercial activ ities. T hese inc lude: private sector interest and investm ent, national econom ic priorities, and co ntributions to econom ic growth. Optimiz ing Research and Education The cadre of high caliber participatin g scientists is too sm all because The lack of predictable, frequent, an d tim ely access to fligh t opportunities lim its interest from the resea rch, commerc ial and educational sectors, and Research program s lack a stable funding base. Education o f the next generation of sc ientists and engineers s uffers because Graduate and postdoctoral students are c onstrained from participating in NASA research by unpredictable flight oppo rtunities with interv als often exceeding students' time in train ing OBPR Implementation Preliminary Implementa tion Analysis of 1st and 2nd Priority Research Most of the ReMAP research priority findi ngs were established m eeting #2 and was based o n these in terim Task Fo rce research priority findings. 33Specific Findings Findings on Science P roductivity Prelim inary OBPR Implementa tion Analysis Suggests th at at US Core Complete and at US+IP Core Complete capability t o do high priority rese arch is limit ed: Crew tim e and upm ass places con straints on the amount of high priority research that can be addressed. Comm itments to In ternational Par tners exace lems of adequate crew time. Some OBPR research o f scientific and/ or commercial im portance can b e accommodated on platform s other than ISS. Several ha rdware com ponents cr itical to hi gh-priority research investigations are not funded in the current OBPR budget. Availability of powered m iddeck lockers is no t sufficient to m eet nom inal requ irements of high priority research. At a Shuttle flight ra te of 4/year, there is inad equate accommodation for delive ring mass to orbit for research. 34Recommendations 3.0 Recommendations Framew ork for Recommendations The charge to ReMAP by the NASA Adm inistrator, echoed b y the OBPR Associate Adm inistrator, was that ReMAP s hould concentrate efforts on prio ritizing the existing research program s within OBPR. (Also refer to Appendix A, Ter ms of Reference, 1st paragraph.) In order to do this, ReMAP considered as fully as possible the extensive background of reviews and reports to N ASA addressing space research p riorities. ReMAP perfor med its prioritization analys is without regard to budget or facility constraints, and recommends the resulting set of prior ities f or OBPR research to NASA to inform current and future im plementation decisions and guide future program developm ent. ReMAP was inform ed of the exten t to which NASA can address thes e research priorities, given the cu rrent budg et, and curren t and pla nned ISS facilities and capabilities. This inform ation did not affect the pr iorities identif ied. 3.1 Science on ISS If enhancements to ISS beyond \" US Core Co mplete\" are not anticip ated, NASA should cease to characteriz e the ISS as a science driven program. Rationale : OBPR's i mplem entation analysis suggested dif ficulties in implem enting the high priority research given the current and near-term plan. Crew tim e, resupply upm ass, and fa cilities are m ajor factors. Other reaso ns for ISS include engin eering ach ievement, space commercialization, intern ation al leadership, and class room education . 3.2 ISS Research Productivity NASA must resolve the upmass and crew research time iss ue. Rationale : Crew tim e and upm ass were identified as pres enting sign ificant res trictions on research productivity under both US and US + IP Core Com plete configurations. IP barter agreem ents are based on res earch that requires g reater than a 3 -person crew. ReMAP understands that NASA is exam ining crew tim e availability for research and encourages vigorous attention to this critica l resource. 35Recommendations 3.3 Current ISS Productivity As ISS nears completio n, NASA should increa se scienc e priority and productivity on ISS. For each IS S increm ent, designate o ne crewm ember as the \"science officer.\" The scienc e officer will be the pr imary crew person to par ticipate in p ayload tra ining. At least 1/3rd available crew tim e (assum es a three person crew) should be dedicated to science o perations. Other crewm embers als o participate in science o perations. Upm ass allocations m ust support the ISS cr ew conducting scientif ic investigations. If this canno t be accommodated on assem bly or logistic fligh ts, add a Sh uttle fligh t to the m anifest that will bring only science payloads to ISS. Rationale : Currently, science is not a prio rity for the lim ited crew tim e and upm ass availab le for ISS. 3.4 Basic Research OBPR should include, in its high-p riority res earch portfolio, outstanding basic scientific research programs tha t address important q uestions in the physical and biological sciences, and w hich require long-term experiments on the ISS, based on their intrinsic scientific value. Rationale : OBPR's research portfolio m ust be built ar ound the m ost important scientific prob lems relevant to the NASA mission on th e ISS, rather than covering representative sub-fields of science. 3.5 Implementation of ISS Research Facilities NASA sho uld ensure appropriate funding for impl ementation of high priority facilities, such as the habitats an d centrifug e. Rationale : A num ber of facilities required to p erform the highest priority biological and physical sciences res earch are cu rrently un-funded or delayed. Essentia l understand ing of the f ull range of effects of gravity on lif e will r equire : Appropriate plant & anim al habitats Either as previously plan ned or accep table alternatives Essentia l to perf orm the resea rch Centrifuge capability needed to Identif y threshold load ing condition s Validate prelim inary findings sugges ting a role of microgravity where controls (as sessment of other f actors related to ISS condition s) could not be analyzed. 36Recommendations 3.6 Fully Utilize Available Options for Space Research NASA sho uld consider additional Shuttle scie nce/commercial fligh t opportunities. Investigate dedicated science and /or commercial flights on a regular basis. Guarantee flight opportu nities Guarantee routine, repetitive acces s to space Investigate the possibility of auctioning r ack space to gauge true m arket interest. Rationale : Many science priorities do not need long duration in space. Many scien ce priorities d o need repetitive, routine access to sp ace. NASA fundi ng m ay impact m arket interest. Use of non-NASA funds to purchase a flight oppor tunity can be used as another indication of the value of the proposed space research. 3.7 Time to Orbit NASA must reduce the time betw een experi ment selection and flight for research investiga tions. Rationale : Current long lead-tim e discourages excelle nt researchers from proposing to NASA's program s. \"Tim e to orbit\" is a m ajor comm ercial partner co ncern. Reasonably short tim es are essential if graduate students are to be involved. 3.8 Research Funding In order to attrac t high caliber s cientists fr om a large national pool, NASA must assure science as a priority commitment w ith regar d to flight schedule and project funding. Rationale : Research funds have been diverted a tota l of 4 tim es to cover engineering overruns. Office of Space Flight in dicated total research slippage for in vestigators has been as much as 4-5 years. 3.9 Methods for Research Solicitation OBPR should consider alternat ive methods fo r research s olicitation and recruiting of key performers. Rationale : Solutions for OBPR's goal-oriented, need-dri ven research problem s may be facilitated by alternative m ethods of so licitation and recru iting. Project selection by peer review A consensus based approach Works best for individual PI science program s Works best for broad focus, science comm unity driven 37Recommendations DARPA-style program manage ment Can open new areas Serves to build comm unities Can support multi-inv estigator pro jects Works best for goal-oriented research 3.10 Increase Ca dre of OBPR Investiga tors OBPR must develop mechanisms to increa se the quality a nd cadre of scientists participatin g in its research programs. Rationale : More young and active investigator s from top research instituti ons should be recruited to work on NASA's high priority questions. The Task Force felt the investigator commun ity should be larger and m ore diverse. 3.11 Science Leadership OBPR scientists should ensure the development of a visionary strategic research program that is focus ed on the problems w hose solut ions w ill furthe r the NASA miss ion. Rationale : Developm ent of a stra tegic, goal-orie nted progr am will enable selec tion the best research to f acilitate space expl oration and fundam ental science. 3.12 Process OBPR should consider interdis ciplinary or ganization and program structures aligned along resea rch questio ns rather th an disciplin e. Rationale : OBPR is currently organized by discipline. Tends to solicit by discipline, generally si ngle investigator res earch proposals. Alterna tive organiza tion coul d be more flexible. Many of the high priority questions ar e interdisciplina ry in n ature. OBPR progr ams would be m ore productive if microgravity physics and life science program s were integrated. Different kinds of research require different structures (e.g., team approach vs. single investigator). 3.13 Coordinating Research Efforts OBPR life s ciences s trategy should integrat e multiple levels of analysis, ce from Fundamental Micrograv ity, Engineering, Commercia l Engin eering, a nd Technology Development w here it makes sense. Examples: combustion and fire safety. Rationale : Coordinated strategies focused on specific problem s would optim ize research productivity. 38Recommendations 3.14 Potential N ew Lines of Research OBPR should examine potential lines of resea rch outside of th e current research portfolio. Rationale : ReMAP Task Force prioritized only the curren t research po rtfolio. 3.15 Metrics Given that NASA has multip le requirements for producing and reporting productivity metr ics, the purpose of each metr ic shou ld be clearly delin eated such as science productivity, education outreach, and public affairs. Rationale : Specific m etrics, ev en when accurate, do not n ecessarily index the m easure of interes t. For exam ple, m edia atte ntion is no t suitab le for evaluation o f scientif ic quality. 3.16 Coordination with International Partners NASA sho uld continue coordination of faci lities developm ent and research solicitations with the International Partners (I P), a nd attempt to address the IP concerns. Rationale : The IPs hav e chosen to build ce rtain ISS resea rch facilities a nd not other s to avoid replication b ased on und erstand ing of shared facility u tilization. IPs have con tinued in terest in coo rdination with N ASA and subm itted ana lyses of their priorities and and Process 4.0 ReMAP Organiz ation and Process OBPR Divisions and Research Thrusts NASA presented the research of the 4 Divisions of the Office of Biological and Physical Research (O BPR) to the Task Force as com prising 8 prim ary them e areas, integrated organizationally as shown below. ReMAP Task Force m embers f ocused their activitie s on the ir areas of expertise. Th e expertise of Task Force m embers is show n on the list of panel m embers on page 42.

The Congressionally m andated annual budget fo r ISS includes the OBPR ISS Research Capability Budget that supports the research hardware developm ent. ReMAP did not review budgetary issues, though it did note where there w ere gaps in the implementation of high priority research (i.e., plant and anim al habitats). OBPR research funding includes ISS-based resear ch as well as research imple mented on the shuttle, and the ground. ReMAP did not review this level of budget detail when deliberating the res earch areas. 41Organization and Process Alignment of Task Force Expertis e with OBPR Divisions and Research Thrusts NASA presented the research of the 8 them e areas as com prising 3-6 \"Res earch Thrus ts\" integrated organizationally and pr as shown below. To best use Task Force expertis e to prioritize res earch, m ember s broke into Discipline team s according to their self-id entified exp ertise in each of the 8 Research Them es, as follows: 42 Organization and Process Prioritiz ation w ithin and among research themes: The OBPR program background, objectives, and de scriptions of the re search thrusts and them e areas were provid ed to the Task Force. OBPR devel oped a proposed set of criteria for evaluating OBPR research program s and presented this to the Task Force at the fi rst m eeting. These crite ria were vetted by the Task Force and were agreed to be an appropr iate starting point for evaluation of research priorities. T he Task Force incorporated all of the above into their prioritization process, but went a level further in deciding the fina l priorities. Additional considerations for distinguishing between high, m edium, and lower priorities were articulated by the Task Force (see Appendix L, ReMAP Prioriti zation Crite ria and J ustification). Each Discip linary Team established priorities and presented their rationale for prior itizatio n to the f ull Task Force f or discussion. This included presentations by individuals or sm all groups within the Team summarizing the Task Force perspective on previous rev iews and recomm endations (\" meta-analysis \") of NASA's space research program in the them e area. Once within -them e prior ities had bee n identif ied, the Task For ce, as a bod y, analyzed the results acros s them e areas and develo ped a se t of science-driven priorities for OBP R research. The Task Force analysis w as performed w ithout regard to ISS facility constraints , in keeping w ith instructio ns from the Administrator. Following the estab lishment of priorities, Re MAP was provided with an analysis of the extent to which NASA c an address the research priorities given the current and planned ISS capabilities. This inform ation was not independently evaluated by ReMAP. W hile it did not affect ReMAP priorities, it w as taken into account in the findings and recomm endations. The Task Force w as charged to identify the best science th at could be done by OBPR on the ISS and other platforms, and used the information made available in reports from previous review committees ava ilable for each of the OBP R divisions. The Task Force lim ited its analys is to the exis ting OBPR research por tfolio. The Task Force noted the unique features of ISS (hum an tended, long duration [> 1 month], exposure to m icrogravity) and iden tified research that can only be conducted on the ISS. The Task Force noted th at each OBPR division h ad been rev iewed frequently and recently. Im portantly, serial revi ews of each divis ion were co nsisten t in th eir findings and recomm endations lending confidence to ReMAP conclusions based on this inform ation. The Task Force proces s for prioritiz ing the research prog ram of OB PR and ISS w as informed b y The Term s of Reference (see Appendix A) desc ribe the charge given to the ReMAP Task Force. The NASA Adm inistrator's address to the group at the first and third m eeting em phasized that the ReMAP Task Force should focus on defining the science research priorities without regard to budgetary and facility constraints. 43Organization and Process Inputs to the Task Force Structured Briefings : Reviews of NASA vision and m ission; OBPR research program s, priorities an d criteria; background on the In ternational Space Station ; resu lts of the Intern ation al Space Station (ISS) Managem ent and Cost Evaluation Task Force (IMCE) review; OBPR i mplementation analysis; OB PR science m etrics presentation, Meeting with the In ternation al Partner s (IP) and presentation to the co mmittee by Peter Voorh ees, Chair of the NRC Committe e for Mic rogravity Re search. Formal Reports: External res earch review repo rts (prim arily studies conducted by the NRC) were m ade available to th e Task Force. These previous reports played a key role in ReMAP deliberations. T he comm ittee received s ome of these reports from OBPR prior to the first m eeting. Many more reports were made available to the Task Force as delibe ration s proceeded. The committee re lied heavily on th e expertise an d tim e invested by hundreds of m embers of the scientific co mmunity in generating these reports. The analysis of previous reports contributed very significantly to the findings on research priorities and recomm endations. 44Appendix A: Terms of Terms of Ref erence These Terms of Reference estab lish the Res earch Maxim ization and Prioritization (R eMAP) Task Force of the NASA Advisory Council (N AC). The ReMAP Task Force is chartered to perform an independent external review and asse ssment of research p roductivity and priorities for the entire scientific, t echnological, and commercial portf olio of NASA's Biological and Physical Research Enterprise, and to provide recomm endations on how to achieve the greatest progress in high-priority research wi thin the President's budget request. This task f orce will p roduce a f inal report th at will f ocus spec ifically on th e following item s: 1. Evaluate and validate high priority scie nce and technology research to be funded by OBPR to m aximize the r esearch retu rn within the availab le resources in th e Presiden t's FY 2003 Budget for OBPR and Inte rnational Space Station (ISS). 2. Evaluate the m ajor thrust areas and key re search objectives for OBPR wi th an em phasis on establishing the research content f or the ISS U S Core Complete configuration. a. Assess how these key ob jectives can be addressed by the ISS relative to other means (e.g. ground-based research, free-flyers, S pace Shuttle). b. Recomm end how the ISS capabilities or other means could be used to best achieve h igh-prio rity res earch objectives. c. Given these m ajor thrust areas and the results of item 2b, assess research content options consistent with the ISS US Core Com plete configuration. Assess the extent to which each op tion allows for a viab le ev olution of th e research strategy, given the po ssibility of research -driv en enhancem ent to the ISS beyond US Core Com plete. d. Recomm end m odifications and/or additi ons to the OBPR research goals and objectives. 3. Recomm end ways to increase scientif ic productivity (e.g. autom a non- governm ental organization for m anaging arch, etc.) and the m etrics to m easure productivity. 4. Recomm end criteria that can be used by OB PR to im plem ent specific research activities and program s based on docum ented priorities. 5. Identif y areas for prior ity consulta tion with the in terna tiona l partners. 45Appendix A: Terms of R eference MEMBERSHIP The NASA Adm inistrator shall app oint the Cha ir and Mem bers of the T ask Force.

The objectives of the m eeting were to help de termine capabilities NASA does and does not have in its priority areas of resear ch, and to help understand the international nature of the ISS research program from experim ent recruitm ent through im plementation. The international nature of research is based on tw o prem ises: 1) IPs chose to build certain ISS research facilities and no t build o thers based on the understan ding that IPs would share facility utilization and avoid replicati on, and 2) IPs would coordinate biological and physical research solicitations (internationally). The IPs were given the action to answer the following questions: Why is the International Space St ation necessary for research ? What research requires a short-term mission and what research necessitates a long-term mission in space? What are the research areas in which use of the Centrifuge on the ISS is important? The responses from the IPs (CSA, ESA, and NASDA) were reviewed by the ReMAP Task Force and are provided in this appendix. Meeting Minutes Attendees : ReMAP IP Subcommittee: Rae Silver Andreas Acrivos Mary Jane Osborn Jim Pawelczyk Canadian Space Agency (CSA) : Alan Mortim er (presenter) John Marrone Heinz Gindl Graham Gibbs NASA: Lisa Guerra Louis Ostrach Bradley Carpenter Rebecca Spyke Gardner European Space Agency (ESA) Karl Knott (presenter) Ian Pryke National Sp ace Develop ment Agency of Japan (NASDA) Masato Koy ama (presenter) 92Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners IP Presenta tions CSA outlined the f ollowing as their n l spac e prior ities ( in no particu lar ord er): o Earth and the environm ent o ISS utilization o Mars exploration o Small sate llites ESA gave an inf ormal presentation a nd will f ollow up with a f ormal written repor t to the ReMAP Task Force in May. o ESA's m ain goal in spa ce resea rch is to benefit hum ans on Earth. o There is no prior itizat ion of research disc iplines at pres ent. NASDA said that the following research fields will be em phasized in the m erger of Ja pan's three sp ace agencies (NASDA, National Aerosp ace Laboratory, and Ins titute for Space and Aeronautical Science): o Microgravity Science o Space Biolo gy o Space Medicine Internation al Coordination and Concerns CSA, ESA, and Japan have chosen to build cert ain ISS research facilities and not build others based on the understand ing that IPs would share facility u se to avoid facility rep licatio n. Changes in NASA comm itments to f acility rovision would theref ore af fect all IPs. CSA, ESA, NASDA, and NASA int ernationally c oordinate biological an d physical research solic itations. o Research proposals undergo an international pe er review process. The international peer review process ensures world-class science selection. o One agency's research proposal m ay use another agency's fa cility through the international cooperation process. o Cancellation of one partner's facilities therefore affects research sponsored by other partners. o Reduced ISS resources (e.g., crew tim e, upmass, etc.) will significantly reduce international research capa bilities and m ay jeopardize co ntinued IP participation. The m ain IP concern is lack of crew tim e for re search given a three-person crew for an extended period. 93Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners CSA Rep ort CANADIAN SPACE AGENCY Further to discussions with the NASA Research Maxim ization and Prioritization Task Force, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) wishes to prov ide input on th ree issues id entified in o ur presentation to the com mittee on April 19, 2002. Internation al Cooperation for the Scientific U tilization of Internation al Space St ation (ISS) From the outset the CSA has developed progr ams based on a collabo rative internation al approach. T he CSA has seen international collabo ration as th e most efficient and effective way to reach n ational goals w ithin the bud get that ha s been allo tted. Intern ational cooperation does, however, mean that the CSA has chosen not to bu ild certain experim ental hardware that would support very high priority science objectives. At the sam e time, the CSA has agreed to provide to the in ternationa l community hard ware that is of less str ategic im portance nation ally, components required by the overall international sc ientific community as part of a complete science labo ratory. Th is is es pecially im portant for life sciences. For example, the CSA decided not to develop rodent facilities fo r ISS, seen as one of the highe st priorities nationally, and has agreed to provide the Insect Habi tat, which is of great s cientific value, but which has much lower national priority. Other Agencies have m ade sim ilar decisions. Both the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA have agreed not to build duplicate hardwa re for the study of hum an physiology and to integr ate the hardware in to a si ngle laboratory co-located with in the ISS. Further, e arly discussions am ongst all ISS partners reached an agreem ent to build only one com bustion facility so that resou rces cou ld be used to build other m icrogravity facilities. International cooperation in the scientific utilization of ISS ha s led to a shared international equipm ent set tha t allows all pa rtners to m eet th eir scientific objectives, making best use of the resources on ISS in an efficient and continuous manner. However, no partner will b e able to meet even their high p riority s cientific object ives unless all ag encies provide the research elem ents that have been mutually agreed. International cooperation extends beyond a coordina ted research facility. Currently experim ents to be perform ed on ISS are solicited jointly by all partners using the sam e announcem ent and background inform ation. Proposals s ubmitted by sc ientists from all partn er countries are reviewed by the sam e international peer review pane l. Selection for flight is the responsibility of an inte rnatio nal ste ering committee. Once selec ted, experim ents are prepared for flight with the oversigh t of intern ation al implem entation co mmittees that follow progress and can m ake adjustm ents to m aximize the science return to all partner agen cies. Intern al integr ation of the tion of ISS has been im plem ented at all stages. Not only does it provide an excellent exam ple of international cooperation, the sharing of resources an d responsib ility has prov ided the m ost effective approach to the m aximizing of scientif ic return f or all ISS partners. 94Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with ated tional scien tific team s, allowing m ore rapid advance in the depth and range of our knowledge. Utiliz ation of ISS The CSA vi ews the ISS as the only p latform for a variety of scientific investigations. In particular: ISS provides the only opportunity for long duration m icrogravity experim ents: This is good for protein crystal grow th, sem i-conductor crystal growth, diffusion studies, m ulti- generation studies of anim als, radiation biology in space, phy siological ad aptation of hum ans and anim als and the study of cum ulative effects in both biological and physical disciplines. ISS is hum an-tended : Astronauts are required f or studies in hum an physiology, (bone loss, cardiovascular system , radiation studies) and psychol ogy. Astronauts allow real-tim e iteration of experim ents in response to unexpected results, human observa tion of experim ents and interaction with investigators. Som e processes require hum an intervention, such as anim al care over extended periods or particularly delicate m anipulations. ISS provides frequent access and experim ent repetition: ISS allows r epetition an d iter ation o f experim ents within a re asonable time. This will increa se the scientific rigor of the research (by incr easing the experimental sample size) and allow advances to be m ade in the tim eframe required so that th e results c an imp act terrestrial res earch prior ities. Large payloads can be accommodated by ISS : Sophisticated payloads such as Fluid Science Laboratory or the Centrifuge cannot be accommodated on m ost free flyers. Transport to/from ISS is generally ge ntle com pared to other vehicles: When com pared with free flyer options, launch and landing are relatively gen tle. This is important in order to preserve pr otein and other crystals grown in space and to have less im pact on live specim ens. Scientific P riorities From the outset, the CSA science program s have worked on the prem ise that \"W e cannot be all things to all people\". Th e program has taken a fo cused appro ach to scientific research in space. Research dir ections h ave been sele cted with the a dvice of standing adviso ry committee s and input from the wider scientific com munity through workshops. Priorities have been based upon: Areas of national priority 95Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners Areas of national excellence Niches where Canada can significantly adva nce the inte rnatio nal scientif ic effort Areas with benefits on E arth This proces s has led to id entification of the f ollowing resea rch areas : Life Sciences: Bone and Muscle Loss Significant in space, particularly for long term flight Relevant on earth particular ly in processes of aging Cardiovascular and Metabolic Physiology Important and for long duration flights and return to Earth Significant in study of heart di sease and m etabolic disorders Radiation Area of national excellence Critical for long duration space m issions Directly im pacts r adiation saf ety and cancer treatm ent on Ear th Neuroscience Long history in space research in Canada Wide range of applications to condi tions associated with aging on Earth Significant applications to operationa l considerations during s paceflight Isolation and Multi-c ultural Psychology An area of significant national expertise and national pride Critical for long duration spaceflight Assists in many applications on Earth Microgravity Sciences: Materials Science Mechanism s, basic physical prope rties and fundam ental issues The goal is to im prove processes and products on Earth Fluid Science Study of the m otion or structure of fluids Use spaceflight of physical properties and processe s affected by gravity Biotechnology Study of the structure and behavior of non-living organic m aterial Protein crystallization for developm ent of stru ctures on Earth with bi omedical app lication The centrifuge is a critical s cientific element fo r the ISS ISS partne rs have develo ped a plan f or provid ing a set of experimental ha rdware, which will allow the best science from around the world to be perform ed on the ISS . The centrifuge is centra l to ou r ability to o btain sc ientif ic results th at will b e accepted by th e inte rnation al scientific community. The cen trifuge provides the control; th e com parison, to determ ine the 96Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners changes caused by the w eightless environm ent. A control is clear ly ess ential in the d esign of anim al experim ents. In fact m ost ISS hardwa re has been built to m ake use the cen trifuge for control samples. The centrifuge is however al so critical for cell biology and plant biology and will also stre ngthen the s cientif ic value of studies in fluid phy sics. The centrifuge is also the only m ethod currently av ailable to create frac tional gravity fields. Fraction al gravity allows scientists to deve lop models to explain the pr ocesses th at lead to changes obs erved durin g spacefligh t. It rem ains th e only approach to develop th e predictive theories to explain how gravity m ay have an im pact living and physical system . Without the centrifuge, much of the science that is com pleted on ISS will be of di minished value 97Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners ESA Rep ort EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY ESA offers the following responses to three questions posed by NASA's ReMAP Task Force with rega rd to resea rch on the ISS in term s of both its national and scientific im portance. The questions being addressed by ESA are: 1. Justification for doing research on ISS: w hy is the ISS necessary for your agency' s resea rch? 2. What research requires a short-term mission and what research necessitates a long-term mission in space? 3. What are the research areas in which use of the Centrifuge on ISS is im portant for your agency ? Concerning the first of these questions Eighteen years ago E urope was invited am ongst other Partners to p articipate in the jo int dev elopm ent and exploitatio n of the Space Station for the pursuit of bo th fundam ental and applied resear ch. Since that tim e ESA has comm itted not only a significant financial engagem ent to develop key infrastructure elem ents of ISS but also in a close dialogue with NASA and other Partners for its coordinated utilizati on. In view of these investm ents ISS is the centerp iece for Europe fo r research in life and physical scien ces in microgravity. In answer to the second questi on I would like to em phasize that we do not see short and long- term missions as being separately linked to spec ific research areas. Clea rly the effects of long- term exposure of hum ans to low-gravity and radi ation conditions can only be researched using space statio ns. In the o ther areas su ch as fluid p hysics, bio technology, crystal g rowth , cell biology, combustion etc. it is true that individual experim ent runs can be relatively short (hours, days) but the days of one-off experim ents re search are long gone. Nowadays ESA receives proposals that are for programm es of research invol ving extensive iteration of parameter variations extending over weeks and m onths. Sounding Rocket activ ities are essentially for pre- ents and off-load short duration experim ents from ISS. Russian Foton missions offer som e research possibilities but ar e extrem ely lim ited on real tim e data intera ction and offer only lim ited interactiv e capability. In this connection SPACEHAB flights can offer interesting n ear term possibilities and ESA ha s been extensively involv ed in recen t SPACEHAB missions. ESA would therefore like to suggest to the Comm ittee that NASA be urged to consider continuing SPACEHAB research m issions during the ISS assembly period. For the last question, ES A presen tly develops facilities such as EMCS and BIOLAB that have their own built-in centrifuges. Th ese facilities are directed at re search in biology and sm all plant physiology and require only centrif uges of m oderate size. ESA presently studies a m ice facility that will also have a 90 cm . Centrifuge adequate for research on m ice. So, up to now the research plans of ESA do not significantly require the use of the large centrifuge on ISS. 98Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners NASDA Report NATIONAL SPACE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY OF J APAN NASDA offers the following responses to NASA' s ReMAP Task Force in the areas of Life Sciences an d Microg ravity Scien ces with rega rd to resea rch and both its national and scientific importance. (1) Life Science Area a) Justification for doing research on ISS: why is th e ISS necessary for your agency' s research ? Whether the life is lim ited to the earth or universal is one of our funda mental questions. To learn about the life on earth, studying in extraterrestrial environm ent is particularly valuable and crucial. Previously unknown biological phe nomena that we re veiled with terr estria l environm ental factors will com e into view. The International Space Statio n (ISS) will provide a unique environm ent other than th e earth surface for observ ing biological p henom ena. Findings on the ISS will not on ly be essential for the human space ac tivity, but a lso give us great ins ight to the prin ciple of the lif e. b) What research requires a short-term mission and what research necessitates a long-term mission in space? Biological phenom ena c onsist of m any processes w ith various tim e scales. Som e, such as nerve excitem ent, com plete within a second while others, hum an senescence for exam ple, take years. Space m otion sickness shows rem ission in a few days , while bone loss keeps progress. Thus, the period required for biological experim ents varies . The ISS meets experim ental requirem ents c) What are the research areas in which use of the Centrifuge on ISS is im portant for your agency ? Since num erous factors affect biological responses , quantitative observations m ust be m ade in comparison with control groups. Experim ental group and control groups are required to differ only in a single param eter. Other param eters m ust be kept ex actly identic al. Artif icial gravity generator or the Centrifuge is thus indispensable for the entire gravitational biology research. The Centrifuge is also essential to k eep expe rimental o rganism s under earth-like con ditions and ready to be exposed to the space env ironm ent without rem aining influence of the laun ch. (2) Micro Gravity Science Area a) Justification for doing research on ISS: why is the ISS necess ary for your agency' s research? Microgravity is an environm ental factor , as ultra-high vacuum s, super -high temperature, super -high pressure and high-en ergy radiation are. These environm ental factors m ay work positiv ely to aid unders tanding of unclear phenom ena, verification of theories and/o r fabrication of new f unctional m aterials. They ca n also be expected to co ntribu te to the acquis ition of 99Appendix F: ReMAP Task Force M eeting with the International Partners innovative knowledge when used as tool s for analyzing various phenom ena. The use of m icrogravity itself seldo m facilita tes the establis hment of innovative theo rems. Instead, by taking advantage of the symm etry attained from the gravity-free state, we should use it for verifying conventional theories; for veri fying theorem s using sim plified m odels that eliminate the com plexity of ground convection- related phenom enon; for sim plifying phenom ena by excludin g the ort properties, a nd for im proving the function and quality of materials characteristics. ISS is the best opportu nity for these m icrograv ity science research activ ities. For the fundam ental physics, in order to observe or realize the steady state of the quantum physics phenom ena, the m icrogravity condition is significan tly beneficial because th e quantum itself become free from the gravity acceleration. b) What research requires a short-term mission and what research necessitates a long-term mission in space? Method (duration) Research Area Drop tower (<10s) Com bustion, Fluid physics (ex. bubble movement, etc), experim ental technology technolo gy developments, Fluid physics (ex. bubble move ment, two phase flow, etc), Sounding rocket (<6m in) Com bustion, solidification (alloys, composites, etc), High precise therm o-physical m easurem ents, Fluid physics (ex. boiling, etc), Colloid phy sics Space shuttle (< 2weeks) Diffusion (self diffusion, inter diffusi on), solidification (alloys, etc), High precise therm o-physical m ents, Fluid physics (ex. Com posites, Crystal growth m echanism , Crystal growth from melt (sem i-conductor), protein crystal growth ISS Crystal growth from melts and so lution (sem i-conductor, protein, etc.), solidification (alloys, co mposites, etc.), precise therm o-physical measure ments, Diffusion (self diffu sion, inter diffusion), Fluid physics (ex. Marangoni convection, etc), Fund amental Physics (laser cooling, atom ic clock, etc) 100Appendix G: Oppo rtunities APPENDIX G: Opportunitie s to Im prove ISS Productivity w ith AHST Provided i n Response to th e ReMAP Request to OB PR for Strategies to Im prove Productivit y on ISS May 2002 The Advanced Human Sup port Technol ogy (AHST) program through its in dividual project elem ents can make a subst antial contribution towa rd improving ISS productivity by increasi ng: 1) available crew ti me; 2) crew efficiency ; and 3) crew sa fety. Estim ates contained in this docum ent for technolog y development lead-ti mes ref lect Code U efforts in the advanc ement of these technologies up to t echnology readiness level (TRL) 6. Developing these technologies to TRL 9 (operational implementati on) will be the responsibilit y of the ISS Pr ogram . Each of the AHST projects identifies current problems on ISS, possible re medies, and benefits as sociate d with pursuing these re medies. The Space H uman Factors Engineering (SHFE) Project can help realize incre ases in crew ti me up to 30 hours per week (for a crew of three) thro ugh im provements in procedure design, stowage design, communicati ons effective ness, sy stematic labeling, and revised com puter interf aces. Table 1 provi des the summary for each of the af orem entioned areas to i mprove ISS productivit y. Mor e details about each of these problems and possible solutions can be found throughout . Table 1A provides some other areas where the SH FE project could effectively increase cr ew time with modest res earch efforts. Over a two year tim e peri od the SHFE project can develop these tool s to TRL 6 for an eventual ISS application. Implementing these i mprovem ents will involve a joi nt effort between OBPR and the ISS Program . Advanced Enviro nmental Monitori ng and Co ntrols (AEMC) Project can help in develo ping sensors that are portable and consume low power. Current station m onitoring equipm ent (Major Constituent Analy zer, Volatile Organics Analy zer) has not pe rformed reliably over extended tim e period s. The advantage of using AEMC generate d sen sors would be their low mass and power requirem ents. Other, indirect benefits associat ed with AEMC m onitori ng technologies include reduction in storage volum e and providi ng for a safe environment. Table 2 outli nes the areas of improvem ent that could be achieved through R&TD in the AEMC project. By developing these miniaturized monitoring technol ogies, it is estimated that there would be mass savings of m ore than 100 l bs for the instrum ents alone. Developing real-time monitoring devic es (e.g. microbial m onitors ) can save up to 12 5 hours of annual crew tim e for microbiologi cal monitoring and also wo uld reduce expendables. The Advanced Life Suppor t (ALS) Project has enga ged in research and technology developm ent activities with the goal of validating ALS technolo gies in an in tegrated test environm ent. The focus of th e ALS Project on the developm ent of next gener ation tec hnologies includes development of technolo gy upgrades for ISS. Tabl e 3 outlines t he mass and crew-ti me savi ngs that woul d be achieved through the a ctivities in the ALS Project. It is esti mated that developing resource recovery technologies can save up mass to station b y 3000-40 00 lbs annuall y. Some other proposed upgrad es can im prove the power efficiency of currently baselined ISS technologies. Most of these savings can be achieved by developing unit processors for recovering resources through t he air, water and solid waste str eams. These processes achieve their greatest econom y at crew size of seven. The Advanced Extravehicular Activity (AEVA) Proj ect can also provide im prove ment in effic iencies toward the current ISS baseline. Som e of these improvements wo uld be c ontingent upon cooperation with our inter national partn ers and the ISS Program . Table 4 outli nes the AEVA project contributions that can be adapted to im prove EVA technolo gies and crew time efficiency . It is estimated that b y making upgra des to current EVA equipment up to 28 crew hours can be saved per EVA (assu ming one EVA every other week). As requested by the ReMAP committee, the AHST Progr am has made conservat ive esti mates with regard to the crew time s avings (these num bers are within a factor of two). 101Appendix G: Oppo rtunities to Improve ISS Pro ductivity with AHST Table 1.

Additional Space Human Factors O pportunities to Improve ISS Productivity Issue Problem Remedy Inventory Managem ent System (IMS) Excessi ve cre w time to locate ite ms. Redesign IMS. Automation Many crew tasks do not require hum an judgment. Identify tasks with highest benefit to cost ratio. Flight Crew Equipment Many crew equ ipment items were no t designed with seri ous atten tion to usability because they were not critical ite ms. Redesign item s such as vacuum cleaner (do es not retain debris when opened), fasteners (used many, many times per wee k), etc. to save cre w time. Communicatio n with Various Syste ms Inefficient a nd inconsistent c ommunications with system s. Standa rdize int erfaces to e.g. IMS, other de vices, by usi ng PDAs. Sche duling Tools Crew time inefficiencies may occu r because scheduling tools may not address resource re quirements and conflicts (e.g., some tool or location neede d by two differen t activ ities; assistan ce fro m 2nd ember needed briefly during procedure). Implement analysis/si mulation tools with necessary sophisticatio n to anticipate con flictin g req uirements of various tasks being scheduled for different crewm embers. 103Appendix G: Pro cedure Design Improvements CURRENT TIME COST: 8 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER Procedures are long and are not cl ear; reading them takes time, es pecially if they are unclear. Assum e procedures are used prim arily during work hours (6.5 hours/day). Assum e procedures are used prim arily during the work week (5 days). Assum e 1/2 of work perform ed during work hours (6.5) is new, co mplicated, or infrequent, and th erefore procedures are used 3.25 hours/day. Assum e procedures are cum ulatively 1/2 of the total task time (1.63 hours/day, 8.13 hours/week). Since all crew m embers use procedu res, assum e this tim e is per crewm ember. POSSIBLE TIM E SAVINGS 2 hours/w eek PER CREWMEMBER Procedure approach, content, and technologi es are all candidates for human factors re view and improvem ents. Changes in accordance with hum an perceptu al or cognitive capabilities and establish ed Hum an Factors (H F) guidelin es and methodologies will re sult in instru ction s that a re more readily an d quickly co mprehended. Assum e that HF i mprovem ents in procedures could reduce time costs associated with them by 25%. This would save 0.4 hours/day and 2 hours/week. NOTE : Crew m ay be inclined to skip proced ures entirely because th ey are long and not clear; skipping procedures results in increased possibility o f errors. HF im provem ents to pro cedures will imp rove acc uracy of performing tasks because : (1) information will b e clear er, and (2) proc edures will no t be skipped. Impact f rom reading p rocedures is a large r issue for Russians reading US procedure s written in E nglish. Procedures are m ore of an im pact for firs t-tim e, difficult, or infrequent operations. There m ay be a learning curve asso ciated with p rocedures. 104Appendix Design Improvements CURRENT TIME CREWMEMBER Lack of enough dedicated stowage volum e/lockers requires crew to stow cargo in open volum e, in front of workstations, equipm ent, m aintenance panels, or stowage panels; crew re peatedly rearranges stowag e to perform daily ac tivities. Assum e this im pact occurs on workdays, as well as on non- work days when crew does housekeeping and recreation (7 days/week). To gain access to other equipm ent, assum e crew s pends 0.75 hours/day, 5. 25 hours/week. Since all crewm embers interact with stowag e, ass ume this tim e is per crew member. POSSIBLE TIME SAVINGS 1 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER Additional and m ore organized stowage acco mmodations facilitated by in novative design solution s would red uce need to move things out of the way for access. Time spent looking for item s can be reduced if sto wage facilities provide m eans of quickly id entifying conten ts. Assum e reduce tim e dem and 25% a nd save 0.2 hours/day, 1.4 hours/week. with stowage s ystem improvem ents, the crew will s till hav e to stage f or transfers an d would occasionally rea rrange inven tory for efficiency. 105Appendix G: 6 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER Communications with each other is impacted due to acoustics. It takes tim e to tran slate to each other or to Audio Term inal Uni ts (ATUs), which are located the ends of m odules. Assum e 0.5 hour/day spent translating to each other and to ATU to communicate, prim arily on work days (5 days/week). This costs 2.5 hrs/week. Communication with ground - takes tim e to tran slate to ATU to talk - takes tim e away from other tasks (ref. robotics on exp 4 interrupted several tim es to talk to ground) . Assum e 0.5 hour/day translating to ATU to address ground calls. This is primar ily on work days, and costs another 2.5 hours/week. Assum e 4% increase in comm unications tim e due to interruptions and acoustic noise interference . With 6.5 work hours/day, this costs 0.26 hour/day or 1.3 hours/week. Summ ing the three sources of tim e costs from communications problem s resu lts in 1.26 hours/day, or 6.3 hours/week. Since all crew m embers must communicate with each othe r and the groun d, assum e this tim e is per crewm ember. POSSIBLE TIME SAVINGS: 3 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER could redu ce costs associated with comm unication issues OPPORTUNITY: Systematic Labeling Improvements CURRENT TIME COST: 3 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER Some hardware is not labeled, is labele d unclearly, or does not m atch procedures or other docum entation. T ime costs are associated w ith delays from trying to identify equipm ent. The crew som etimes re-labels item s themselves on -orbit, which a lso takes tim e. Assum e time im pact from labeling problem s is 7 days/week. Assum e labels are the largest impact during daily ops, work hours, and meal prep (activities which total 12.5 hours per day). Assum e 3% increase in task tim e due to labeling issues. Applied to 12.5 hours per day, the labeling im pact is 0.4 hours/day, o r 2.6 hours/week. Since all crew m embers inter act with labels, assu me this tim e is per c rewmember. POSSIBLE TIME SAVINGS: 1 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER More better onality proced ures might result hours /week. 107Appendix Com puter Interfaces Improvements CURRENT TIME COST: 13 hours/week PER CREW MEMBER Software dis plays on co mputers hav e been repo rted to ha ve basic hum an factors flaws (appearing like a fam iliar W indows application but not behavi ng like that application). Displays have been reported to be difficult and tim e-consum ing to na vigate acro ss screens. Crews report too m any usernam es and passwords to rem ember. Displays are reportedly dissim ilar enough from other displays on-board to cause confusion a nd transfer-of-training issues. Assum e the largest im pact from displays is on work days (5 days/week). Assum e the largest im pact is during work hours (6.5), planning & coordination (0.5), and daily system s ops (1.5) totaling to 8. 5 hours of work involving displays per day. Assum e 30% of task tim e due to Hum an Co mputer Interface (HCI) issu es. W ith 8.5 hours of task tim e involving displays, the impact is 2.5 hours/day, or 12.8 hours/week. Since all crew m embers interact with com puter interfaces, ass ume this tim e is per crew member. POSSIBLE TIME SAVINGS: 3 hours/week PER CREWMEMBER Focused hum an factors and usability evaluati ons of interfaces as well as developm ent of m ore useful and generalized standards should im prove the usability of the displa ys and reduce the tim e spent interacting with them by 25%: 0.6 hours/day, or 3.2 hours/week. 108Appendix Improve ISS Pro ductivity with AHST Table 2.

Zoloth, Ph.D. July 27, 2002 The nature, goal and purpose of th e crew . The science on the ISS is done at this tim e by a hum an crew: simultaneously vulnerable, brave and lim ited by their em bodim ent. The ReMAP comm ittee was conf ronted with th is reality as a central feature of our work, and this defined m any of our discussions of first pr iorities. One of the lead ing ethical issu es we confronted was the seriousness o f the risks th at the crew faces in space. The crew can be understood as functioning in three ways, an d for each ro le, intrinsic rights, duties and obligations for the crew and for the surrounding community--we who send them into space on our b ehalf---chan ges. First, they are resea rchers for the sc ientif ic pro jects, running the science experim ents, checking on the plan ts and anim als, recording th eir observations and readings of the com plex phenom ena, and m aintaining the equipm ent that su stains the research. In this way, they are similar to other scientists who work in extr eme earth env ironments, such as Antarctica or volcanoes, who do their science at the risk of serious harm , or even death. W e understand that such research is in part the work of particular careers in science, undert aken voluntarily, and with the assum ption that risk is a feature of such investigation. Second, the crews are human subjects in what is sim ilar to classic Phas e One clinical trials on ho w the hum an body reacts to m icrogravit y, and to long term confine ment in the harsh and precario us environm ent of space. (We on earth are the co ntrol a rm of such trials ) As subjects of research, they need the full range of protects of su ch subjects, privacy, autonom y, and inform ed consent. W e hope by our use of th e subjects to learn better how to address both medical problem s on earth, and how to address the medical problem s to be solved in space for future crews . Like all P hase One tr ials, it is un likely tha t initial r esearch can benef it the f irst subjects. Like all research, it can be highly risk-laden, and can re sult in serious harm , so m uch so that NIH research commonly have Data Sa fety Monitoring Boards to monitor adverse incidents, harm , and death, and stop hum an trials if they becom e too dangerous. Like all such research, participation is com pletely voluntary. Third, the crews are public servants , voluntarily undertaking a ta sk that is difficult, highly risky and technically dem anding. In th is way the crew need workplace pro tections, similar in nature to how we protect soldiers, police and firefighters. Here too, persons are workers who m ay face the risk of serious harm or death. W e assum e in these cases (and the cas e of both NYPD and NYFD and of soldiers at war as we wrote the docum ent) that high risk activity is a necessary component of a voluntary occupation, taken on in the nam e of duty, love of country and service. Finally, they are explorers, priv ileged to take o n extrao rdinary challeng es in the n ame of discovery. For m any on the ReMAP Task Force, th is last description was the m ost compelling. Our ethical obligations to the crew can be m apped very differently based on how we regard the crew. Such activities have also been a classic part of all explor ation, and in this, we understood the task of L ewis and Clark--part science, part military s tatecraft, and part comm ercial--as paradigm atic. Since m uch of the science is p rioritized in ord er to avo id \"show stoppers\" (things which would term inate a m ission or harm the crew). For an exam ple, the ranking of scientific research in f ire safety becom es named as a high priority for this reason. 128Appe ndix I: Ethical Iss ues Relevant to OB PR Research and Space Flight The needs of the crew for external resc ue should som ething go awry are the single clearest con straint on th e size of the crew. A crew return vehicle only holds three persons. Much of the science proposed cannot be done with onl y three crew members. This only deepens the problem of assessing the cost/benef it analysis of good science, and the need to decide what level of risk to the crew is an acceptab le level of ri sk. There can b e no situatio n of zero ris k--hence, what is at stake is how much risk for harm can be nam ed as acceptab le, as asses sment which varies depending on how you understand the crew as scientists, subjects or soldiers. Risk level assessm ent drives the science priorities, for th e concept of \"show stoppers\" becam e the drivers for som e of the highest priorities of science. We were m oved to ask: who should assess the nature of risk? How can full consent be protec ted? How can we clearly understand the risk as public citizens who fund and support the work ? What risks are accep table, and what unacceptab le(even if the crew m ight wish to take them ) to the larger polity ? Animal exp erimen tation in space International codes of law and norms of resear ch using hum an subjects insist on the use of anim al models f or research prio r to hum an resea rch. In this, separate issues of the anim als on board the sp ace crafts an d the station carry s eparate eth ical ch allenges, an issue giv en great consideration by the agency. In light of the Nu remberg and Helsinki accords for research, full anim al research and its facilities, and all th at this im plies f or anim al habita t and anim al care, would seem to be neces sitated if we intend to us e hum ans in space. Hence, one of the priorities that was nam ed as essential was based on this ethi cal norm . Ani mal habitats that support m odel organism s act as proof of principle f or hum ans. 129Appe ndix J: Glossary of OBP ssary of OBPR Research Division A. Biomedical Research & Countermeas ures Program Behavior & Performan ce Research focused in six areas which include: 1) perception and cogniti on, 2) hum an physical perform ance, 3) personal, interpersonal and group dynam ics, 4) habitability, e.g. hum an factors - how the person responds to the hum an-m achine inte rface, 5) circad ian rh ythm s, advance technology developm ent in these areas.

Any research that did not have the above com ponents did not m ake it to highest priority in the first screening. Additional justif ications determ ined by ReMAP for arriving at the Task F orce priorities included: 1. For f irst pr iority: The research is essential to en able future space exploration. The research could reveal fundam ental laws of nature. The research is targeted toward system s with a known direct response to gravity. The research is hypothesis based. The research requires microgravity, hum an intervention, and long-term access to space. If pertaining to countermeasure de velopm ent, it is m echanism based. There is po tentia l for substantial inc rease in cap ability, efficiency or co st effectivenes s as a result of this research. The project enables the developm ent of a new generation of research scholars by training graduate and postdoctoral students. There is a h igh probability of develo ping t echno logy and applications that will be useful on earth and in sp ace. There is an effective res earch commun ity for qu ality g round - and flight-based research. 2. For second priority: The research effectively utilizes the unique capabilities of the ISS. The research lowers flight risks, im prove s training and enhances performance of astronauts and equipm ent. The research provides better understanding of critical areas in which we already have reliable theories and/or data. The research tests whether the sy stem has a direct response to gravity, or requires access to m icrograv ity to be continu ed. 3. For third and fourth priorities: There has been negative or unclear past experien ce with th is type of space research so that the basic hypot hesis now appears questionable. NASA is not the appropriate funding ag ency - it is not in NASA's m ission. NASA can draw heavily or entirely on othe r agen cy's research. Others are better able to do the research. The requirem ent for space-based res earch in m icrogravity or for ISS is N: Statements of Dissent The ReMAP Task Force striv ed to achieve unan imity in this report. In the second meeting of the Task Force, on April 22, all but one Task For ce member agreed to th e prio rity ranking of the research. Well after the third and final m eeting of the Task Force on May 17, further dissent developed, both before and after the ReMAP re port was presented on July 10 to the NASA Advisory Comm ittee and the public. The dissenter s wer e invited to w rite Minor ity Opinions and/or Statem ents of Dissent, which are included here. See also Appendix C, charts 66 - 68. 158Appendix N: Statements of Dissent June 4, 2002 COMMENTS ON Re MAP'S FINDINGS AND RECO MMENDATIONS As a m ember of the OBPR Research Maxim ization and Prioritization (ReMAP) Task Group I wish to express m y conc erns about: 1. The process by which priorities for microgravity research program s were assigned, and 2. The ranking given to the protein crystallization program . THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS From my observations th e process u sed by ReMAP in settin g prior ities f or microgravity re search was so biased, superficial and arbitrary as to cast serious doubts on the validity of the panel's findings and recomm endations. I believe th is cam e about for the following reasons: Com position of the Task Group The selectio n of the m embers of ReMAP was bias ed toward sm all anim al studies and to th e proposition that life in space, ra ther than life on earth, sh ould be the princip al rationale for microgravity research. Many m embers of the task group had little or no previous experience with NASA's research program s. Perhaps it was intended that this would ensure a fresh outlook but in practice this la ck of historical perspective led to less inform ed decision-m aking. Although many of the program s evaluated had a m edical or comm ercial rationale, only a fe w members of the panel had the requis ite expertis e to evaluate th em. Time Constraints The task group was called upon to prioritize current or proposed microgravity research program s in 8 categories, which were divided into 41 progr ams, many of which were in turn divided into severa l subp rogram s. Only two day s were allo wed f or this exerc ise. The prio ritiza tion p rocess was so rushed and the volum e of inform ation to digest so volum inous that m ost program s were evaluated only superficially. The resea rch program s ReMAP was asked to conside r all fall naturally into on e of three categories : 1. Hum an Health and Safety Research 2. Biological and Physical Research 3. Comm ercial Research 159Appendix N: Statements of Dissent An inordinate a mount of tim e was spent discussi ng program s in the first category even though all agreed th at the health and safety of the crew is of the highest priority. A separate panel of experts in sp ace m edicine should hav e prioritized the programs w ithin th is category. Comm ercial research was given ve ry short shrift by th e task group com posed, as it w as, mainly of individuals with no industrial experience. A s eparate panel, of scientists from industry, should have prioritized the progra ms within this ca tegor y. Had the work of ReMAP been divided into thr ee separate, concurrent panels, the discussions would have been m ore substantiv e and the prioritization process m ore valid. There is no need to prioritize among the three catego ries, because the first is undisputedly a top priority and Congress mandates the third. Lack of Attention to Previous Peer R eviews Since there was no tim e to develop independent eval uations of research program s, previous peer reviews sho uld have been accepted as the basis f or setting p riorities. This was certainly not done in the case of the protein crystallization program . Several m embers who had no previous experi ence with the program or expertise in crystallography expressed strong negative opinions about its worth. From their comm ents it was clear that these ind ividuals bas ed their opini ons on criticism s they had heard from persons outside the task group. However, th ese criticis ms were all address ed by a recen t NRC report [ Future Biotechnology Research on the International Space Station , National Academ y Press, W ashington, D.C., (2000)]. NASA has m oved expeditiously to implem ent the NRC recomm endations. Only three m embers of ReMAP stated that th ey had ever seen or read the NRC report. I requested that copies of the repor t be distributed to all the m embers before the final meeting, but this was not done. To the extent that the NRC report was considered at all, it was m isrepresented and quoted out of context. Failure to Adhere to a C onsisten t Set of Prioritiza tion Criter ia The ranking process was arbitrary and chaotic. At the first m eeting ReMAP m embers were given a list of NASA criteria to be used in evaluating the res earch p rograms. However, thes e metrics were totally ign ored. No research prog ram was ever for mally graded according to that set of criteria or any other. The prioritization of program s in each of the ei ght categories was carried out in breakout groups. Any ReMAP m ember was free to participate in any breakout gr oup, no m atter what his or her degree of expertise in the field. The discussions were brief , less than 30 m inutes total f or all the program s in each catego ry, and tende d to b e dom inated by a few vocal in dividuals. No votes on rankings were ever taken, even wh ere there was clear d isagreement. 160Appendix N: Statements of Dissent RANKING OF THE PR OTEIN CRYSTAL LIZATION P ROGR AM There is a serious disconnect between reality and the ReMAP findings that ranked protein crysta llization in the lo wer third of all the program s considered. I believe protein crystallization should be given the highest microgravity scien ce priority on the following bases: Based on Technical Merit, Accom plishm ents and Potential No other pro gram considered by Re MAP has the quantity a nd quality of favorable attribu tes: 1. The hypothesis upon which the program rests is sound. 2. The success or failure of any experim ent can be easily and precisely determ ined. 3. The potential social and econom ic impact of the program is enorm ous. 4. The program has recently been peer reviewed in great detail. 5. There is a large and supportive user comm unity, 6. Approxim ately 20% of all proteins flown have shown im provem ent in crystal diffraction resolution. 7. The program has an impressive record of comm ercial spin -offs. 8. There have been m any ental gr ound-based experim ents on 9. Sophisticated autom ated experim ental hardware has been demonstrated. 10. There is now a very large experim ental database available. 11. An extensive educational outre ach program has been developed. Based on NASA's Research Merit C riteria Since ReMAP ignored the NASA Research Merit Crite ria given to us at the first m eeting, I have done m y own evaluation of the protein crystalliz ation program based on those m etrics. I have given each o f the 31 criteria listed below a score o f 1 to 5, with 1 being th e highest. Giving equal weight to each of th e criteria (although clearly som e are m ore important than others) m y overall score for the protein crystal lization program is 1.8. I doubt that any other scientific program , were it judged by th ese sam e metrics, would rank as high. 161Appendix N: Statements of Dissent I. Impact to Broad Scientific and Technological Community. a. Will the r esearch have significan t bene fits/applications to g round-based a s well as space-based operations involving the basic disciplines or cross-disciplinary interac tions ? Improve ment in the diffraction resolution of protein crystals can be expected to contribute significantly to funda mental knowledge of biological structures and mechanis ms and to the structure-based design of new drugs for hum an and a nimal disease and of new chem ical agents fo r the production of food and fiber. Ranking 1 b. Will the results have broad usefulne ss, leading to further theoretical, experimental, or com mercial and t echnological developments that have application beyond the particular initiative? Yes. See I.a. above. Ranking 1 c. Will the research help demonstrate th e benefit of using the environment of space to further the advancement of kn owledge or to enhance products and services on Earth? Yes, the benefit of the microgravity environm ent has already been shown for at leas t 36 proteins to yield crystals that diffract to hi gher resolution than the best grown on earth. It is already N ASA's m ost successf ul microgravity program . Ranking 1 d. Is ther e a po tentia l for stimulation of future techn ological \"sp Center for Biophysical Sciences and Engi neering (CBSE) locate d at the University of Alaba ma at Birm ingham (a NASA-f unded Commercial Space Center) has an impressive comm ercialization program. - Four com panies have been spun off from CBSE: (1) Biocryst Ph armaceuticals, a publicly held company listed on NASDAQ, has 77 em ployees. C BSE has licensed to Biocryst inhibitors of three targe t enzym es, all of them in clin ical trials. CBSE will receive ro yalties on any drugs m arketed by the company. (2) Diversified Scientific, Inc., is commercializing laboratory crystallization technology developed at CBSE. 162Appendix N: Statements of Dissent (3) Ibbex is developing certain m edical and research diagnostics, in collaboration with a m ember of the CBSE staff. (4) Oculus Pharm aceuticals is d eveloping high crystallization proteom ics technology developed at CBSE. - CBSE has grown in m icrogravity c rystals of an anti- infectiv e targ et enz yme that show significantly higher diffraction reso lution than the b est grown o n earth. This has resulted in collaboration with an undisclosed biotechnology company for developm ent of inhibitors of the enzym e. - In add ition, CBSE has suppo rted of instrum entation developm ent collaborations with the private sector for technology needed for m icrogravity experim ents. Ranking 1 e. Will the value of the product if or when it is realiz ed in an application be timely? This is the b iggest challenge the protein crys tallization program faces. In order to match the pace of structural biol ogy and drug-design research, the process for growing crystals in m icrogravity m ust be speeded up and m ade m ore user friendly. The num ber of crystallization experim ents m ust be greatly increased and crystals m ust be preserved by cryo-freezin g while they are fresh. Ranking 3 f. Will the res earch stimulate integra tion or combination of now separate concepts or information? Probably not. Ranking 5 g. Will the research results be applicable or beneficial to an area not immediately related to th e field of re search? Possibly. S ome hardware developed for protei n crystallizations on ISS m ay be used in analytical and diagnostic testi ng in ground-based laboratories. Ranking 3 h. What is the impact on exis ting international agreements? The Europ ean and J apanese sp ace agen cies have an active interes t in protein crysta llization and have designed and flow n apparatus on the Space Sh uttle. The re are probably other current or potential internat ional collaborations, but I don't know the particulars. Ranking 1 163Appendix N: Statements of Dissent i. Is ther e pote ntial for eco nomic impact? The economic potential is extr aordinarily high. The annual sales of m any drugs exceed one billion dollars and som e are several tim es th at. It is no t unreason able to as sume that the lif etime market value of a single im porta nt drug designed usin g data from protein crystals gro wn in m icrogravity could ex ceed the entire cost of the ISS. Ranking 1 II. Science Importance a. Are the key scientific qu estions add ressed by th e specific research important? Protein crystallization is of course a m eans to an end. The end, an understanding of biological s tructu res and m echanism s and the design of drugs , is extr aordin arily im portant. Ranking 1 b. Does the research represent a groundbr eaking advance or is it incremental relative to state-of-the-art? In m ost cases the enhancem ent in diffraction resolution will be in crem im are very important in struct ure-based drug design research, w here one is looking for the pos ition of a sm allmolecular n eedle in a large macrom olecular haystack. Ranking 1 c. Is there a potential fo r insight into previously unk nown phenomena, processes, or interac tions ? NASA has already supported a number of gr ound-based experim ents that have yielded important insights into the process of m acromolecular crystal nucle ation and growth. This body of research is one of the strong points of the program . Ranking 1 d. Is the research a significant contribu tion to timely issues, or just buzzword compliant? Structural biology and dr ug design are currently two of th e hottest areas of scientific inquiry. Ranking 1 e. Will the research provide powerfu l new techniques for observing nature? Although x-ray diffraction is not a new technique, the availa bility of higher diffracting crystals will certainly improve our picture of nature. If slow diffusion controlled crystal growth of very large macrom olecular com plexes is as im portant as many believe, then 164Appendix N: Statements of Dissent microgravity m ay help open a whole new wi ndow on nature, i.e., the structures of integral m embrane receptors and m embrane-bound com plexes. Ranking 2 f. Will the research answer fundamental questions or stimulate theoretical understanding of fundamental processes or structures? Yes. See I.a, above. Ranking 1 g. Is there potential for an important advance in knowledge or understanding in areas at the boundaries between disciplines? X-ray crystallography is a field w hich itse lf spans the boundari es between physics, chem istry and biology. Indeed m any of today's structural biologists st arted their careers in one of those three fields before taking up crystallographic research. Ranking 1 III. Contributions to National Goals a. Will the research contribute to nati onal pride and to the image of the United States as a scientific and technologica l leader because of the magnitude of the challenge, the excitement of the endeavor, or nature of the results? The United States is already recognized as th e world leader in drug research. The protein crystallization program can be expe cted to contribute to this position. Ranking 1 b. Will the research contribu te to education by generating stude nt interes t in scien ce or by attracting students to science and engineering? NASA has s ponsored an exciting ed ucational ou treach p rogram in prot ein crystallization through the University of California at Irvine. Students an d teachers, working in their school classroom s and l aboratorie s, are given an opportunity to learn about and to set up crysta llizations of som e of the same prote ins being f lown on the Spac e Shuttle. As of April 2002, more than 5 0,000 studen ts and 1090 teachers from 320 schools acro ss 36 states and P uerto Rico had participated though w orkshops and classroom and laboratory activ ities. S everal hund red students and teachers have helped prepare the actual samples for four recent Space Shuttle flights. Ranking 1 c. Will the research aid in foster ing of commercialization of space? If the pro tein crystalliza tion facility on Inte rnational Space Sta tion is a s successful a nd as user friend ly as I believe it could be, m any pharmaceutical an d biotechno logy com panies are lik ely to want to particip ate. Th ere m ight even be consortia of com panies form ed to 165Appendix N: Statements of Dissent build and operate f acilities f or proprie tary research on ISS. A model for such a consortium is that form ed by twelve pharm aceutical com panies to build and operate x -ray beam lines at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron at Argonne National Laboratory. Ranking 1 d. Will the research present opportuni ties for cooperation with external organizations including international partners? Such cooperation already exists. See I.h. above. Ranking 1 e. Will the research engage and involve the public in research in space? NASA's educational ou treach p rogram at the Un iversity of California at Irvine is an important step in that direction. See III.b. abov e. Ranking 1 f. Will the research contribute to publ ic understanding of the natural world and appreciation of the goals and achievements of science? Protein crystallography is one of the most esth etically pleasing of a ll sciences. W ho does not apprec iate the be auty of crystals, the symm etry of lattic es or the e legance of a protein structure? Modern comput ers, graphic displays and three-dim ensional anim ation software have m ade it possible to open to public understanding the world of com plex molecular s tructur es and their inte ractions. But it all s tarts with crys tals th at dif fract to high resolution. Ranking 1 g. Will the research benefit the economic health of this nation? Yes. Vastly m ore than any other m icrogr avity research yet proposed. The U. S. pharm aceutical industry is one of the biggest positive contribu tors to th e nation's balance of trade. See also I.i. above. Ranking 1 IV. Vital to NASA's Mission a. Will the research substantially contri bute to the health, safety, and performance of humans living and working in space? Yes, in the s ame way that it will bene fit all hum ans. Ranking 3 b. Will the research enhance ISS productivity? 166Appendix N: Statements of Dissent Possibly, through the developm ent of robotics and rem ote visualization hardware and software that m ight be applicable elsewhere on ISS. Ranking 3 c. Is the space environment of fundamental importance to the research, either in terms of unmasking effects hidden under nor mal gravity con ditions or in terms of using gravity level as an added independent parameter, or in providing access to condition s not availab le on Earth? Absolutely. The rationale for growing protei n crystals in m icrogravity is based on the hypothesis that such crystals will be m ore highly ordered and therefor e diffract x-rays to higher resolution. As a crystal grows it depl etes the solute in the surrounding solution, creating what is known as a 'deple tion zone' around the crystal. On earth the less dense depletion zone conti nually dissipates due to the m ixing with the higher dens ity bulk solution. This disrupt ion of the equilibrium around the growing crysta l results in som e solute m olecules being laid down in a disordered m anner. In m icrogravity, however, ther e is little dis ruption of the depletion zone. Solute molecules from the bulk solution diffuse sl owly through the zone and are laid down on the growing crystal in a more ordered manner. Ranking 1 d. Will the research substantially contri bute to the safety and effectiveness of robotic exploration missions? No. Ranking 5 e. Does the res earch requir e a NASA-unique groun exper tise? NASA has assem bled an excellent support st aff at Marshall Space Flight Center and funded private com panies and un iversity laboratories to assi st investigators in flying samples on Space Shuttle. Ranking 3 f. Does the research advance and comm unicate scientific know ledge and understanding of the Earth, the so lar system, or the universe? Not specifically about th e earth itself, but certa inly about life on earth. Ranking 3 g. Does the research expand advanced aer onautics, space science, or space technology? No. 167Appendix N: Statements of Dissent Ranking 5 h. Does this research support NASA's goal to foster the commercial use of space? Very strongly! See I.a., I.d. and I.i. above. Ranking 1 I have m ade no attem pt to rank the protein cr ystallization program on NASA's I mplem entation Criteria since m ost of these depend on budget and schedule projections that are currently undeterm ined or are unknown to m e.

W hile there are many r easons for m y dissent, som e of the most funda mental ones are explained below. The Task Force's p rimary task was to prior itize research, esp ecially ISS research, to achieve m aximum scientific im pact.

However, it is m y opinion tha t there is a considerable amount of excellent scientific work in the physical sciences and commercial program s that can be done within C ore Com plete and with the scheduled shuttle flights, thus fulfilling the m andate to identify good work in an era of fiscal constraints. Much of this work is consis tent with the NASA goal of im proving life on earth. The \"boxes,\" or research cate gories referred to in the Re MAP report were established early and rem ained unc hanged despite voc al opposition by several m embers of the committee.
