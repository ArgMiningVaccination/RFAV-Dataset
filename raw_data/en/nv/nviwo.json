Arthritis is a debilitating and persistent condition that an estimated 52.5 million people in the U.S. live with. But there are plenty of over-the-counter treatment options including creams, lotions, gels, and oils with anti-inflammatory, anesthetic, and additional properties to relieve pain. There are different types of topical medications for pain relief that come in multiple forms: creams, gels, and patches. When it comes to creams, Dena Barsoum, MD, a physiatrist at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), recommends looking for active ingredients like menthol, \"which can stimulate a warm sensation (like using a warm compress) or a cold sensation (like using an ice pack).\" We researched dozens of arthritis creams and evaluated them for ingredients, price, scent, and application type. A board-certified rheumatologist from our Medical Expert Board also reviewed the contents of this article for medical accuracy surrounding arthritis creams and the efficacy of active ingredients in the creams. Here are the best arthritis creams on the market.

It contains max strength lidocaine alongside a botanical blend that aims to desensitize aggravated nerves. Together, they dull pain, reduce inflammation and swelling, and relieve stiff joints. \"Lidocaine, a numbing medication, is a common ingredient in over-the-counter topical medications and can be very helpful. It comes in multiple forms, sometimes combined with other medications,\" says Dr. Barsoum. The time-tested formula has more than 150 years of history to its credit, which boasts a pleasant texture and efficient pain relief on hands, feet, and other achy areas. Arnica creates an instant cooling sensation, while hemp oil targets inflammation and cannabinoid receptors. It's clear and has almost no odor. Price at time of publish: $18 Active Ingredients: Lidocaine, hemp oil, and arnica | Dose: A thin layer applied to affected areas every six to eight hours (not exceeding three applications in 24 hours) | Uses: Temporarily relieves minor pain What the Experts Say \"First and foremost, anyone considering arthritis cream or gel should discuss using the product with their orthopaedic surgeon or primary care physician to ensure it is being used appropriately and for the correct indication.\" \u2014Rachel Frank, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at UCHealth and director of the Joint Preservation Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine Best Cooling Gel Tiger Balm Arthritis Rub Amazon View On Amazon View On Evitamins.com View On Fsastore.com Pros Natural ingredients Good value Pump makes it easy to dispense Cons Some people find it works better on muscle pain than joint pain Smell may be overpowering for some Containing a blend of natural herbal ingredients, Tiger Balm Arthritis Rub provides safe, fast, budget-friendly relief from arthritis joint pain and muscle aches. If you're experiencing symptoms like redness, warmth, and swelling, look for something containing like menthol and camphor, which are both ingredients in this product. These ingredients distract from the pain via cooling sensations. Dispensed from an easy-to-use arthritis-friendly pump, this anti-inflammatory topical lotion isn't greasy and doesn't contain skin-drying alcohol. While it's typically used for deep pain relief, like sore muscles, it can also be used for superficial pain, like shingles. However, it shouldn't be used on broken skin or open wounds or on irritated, inflamed, reddened, or dry skin. Price at time of publish: $14 Active Ingredients: Camphor and menthol | Dose: Apply to affected areas no more than three to four times daily | Uses: Temporary relief of minor muscle and/or joint pain The 8 Best Mattresses for Arthritis of 2023 Best No-Mess Application Salonpas Pain Relieving Patch Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On CVS Pros Patch, so it doesn't stain or make a mess Comes in two sizes; can trim to fit a particular area Cons Strong aroma Some people find the patches won't stay on their skin These patches put all the pain-relieving ingredients right where you need them. It's a no-muss, no-fuss product with three powerful analgesics: camphor, menthol, and methyl salicylate. These patches are available in standard and large sizes, depending on what area you need to treat. Crafty customers also recommend trimming the patches into strips to pinpoint pain and avoid waste. The adhesive is as strong as the pain relief and cooling sensation, so patches stay put for hours. Dr. Barsoum says that \"patches may be more convenient and less messy than creams or gels.\" Price at time of publish: $8 Active Ingredients: Camphor, menthol, and methyl salicylate | Dose: Do not leave a patch on for more than eight hours; do not apply more than three or four times a day | Uses: Temporary relief of minor aches and pains The 9 Best Bras for People With Arthritis Best Homeopathic Naturopathica Arnica Gel Amazon View On Amazon Pros Fast-acting Smooth, non-greasy consistency Long-lasting relief Cons Pricey Not everyone finds relief using arnica When other formulas don't cut it, this luxe Naturopathica gel is worth every penny. The key ingredient is arnica, a prized herb known as \"nature's aspirin.\" Naturopathica's product also contains menthol for a cooling effect and natural aroma and enriched with magnesium to improve muscle function. A little goes a long way with this potent arnica-packed gel that's gentle on skin and dries with a smooth, non-greasy finish. Price at time of publish: $34 Active Ingredients: Arnica and menthol | Dose: Massage a dime-sized amount into affected areas as needed | Uses: Helps to soothe and restore skin after exercise, post-injury, arthritis pain, and otherwise achy muscles and joints How Arthritis Is Treated Best Gel Voltaren Arthritis Pain Gel View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Carewell.com Pros In addition to helping with pain, it also improves mobility and reduces stiffness Formerly only available by prescription, but is now over-the-counter Non-greasy formula Cons Can take several days of use to see results Voltaren's fast-acting gel works triple duty. It relieves arthritis aches, improves mobility, and reduces stiffness for overall arthritis joint pain support. This formula contains a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac gel, which is able to work below the surface of the skin and hit right where it hurts. As an NSAID, diclofenac works by inhibiting the COX enzyme, and it may target additional enzymes, according to some research. That means this ingredient works to alleviate pain from the inside out, and it does so quite effectively. Voltaren's Topical Arthritis Pain Relief Gel is non-greasy so it won't make your feet or any area slippery or sticky. It was previously available by prescription only, but now is over-the-counter. Keep in mind that if you have a health condition (such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) or on blood thinners and you have been told not to take oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs may not be advised. Ask your physician before using this gel. Price at time of publish: $22 Active Ingredients: Diclofenac sodium | Dose: Apply on up to two joints out of hands, wrists, elbows, feet, ankles, and knees for topical arthritis pain relief | Uses: Relieves arthritis pain, improves mobility, and reduces stiffness What the Experts Say \"Voltaren Gel is applied to the inflamed area, for example the knee, and is absorbed through the skin. The medicine works similar to other anti-inflammatories, as it contains an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) but only locally at the site of application, and thus avoids many of the side effects of oral (i.e., pill) arthritis medications. Other topical arthritis creams or gels include agents that numb the skin and provide local pain relief, but do not necessarily reduce the inflammation associated with arthritis.\" \u2014Rachel Frank, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at UCHealth and director of the Joint Preservation Program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine 8 Best Arthritis Gloves of 2023 for Compression and Winter Best with Capsaicin Zostrix Maximum Strength Natural Pain Relief Cream Amazon View On Amazon View On Pharmapacks.com Pros Non-greasy Provides warm, penetrating relief Cons Cream can sting/burn if used on other parts of the body (or places that are touched prior to washing hands) First things first: Yes, this product is going to sting a little\u2014that's the point. Capsaicin is the chemical compound found in chili peppers, so creating that numbing heat is what Zostrix is designed to do. If you're looking for a cooling product, this is definitely not for you. Having said all that, people who do get more relief from heat should still keep in mind that if used incorrectly, this product can (and will) sting other parts of your body if you touch them without thoroughly washing your hands first. But ultimately, when used as directed, many people have used Zostrix to successfully manage arthritis pain. Zostrix shouldn't be used on broken skin or open wounds or on irritated, inflamed, reddened, or dry skin. Price at time of publish: $20 Active Ingredients: Capsaicin | Dose: Apply a thin film of cream to the affected area and gently rub in until fully absorbed. For optimum relief, apply three to four times daily. Best results typically occur after two to four weeks of continuous use. | Uses: Temporary relief of minor aches and pains What the Experts Say \"Most agents have cooling agents like menthol or capsaicin. They cause the skin to feel cool and then warm and they distract the nerve endings from the pain sensation thus relieving pain. Usually the effect is short-lived; it goes away if not used frequently.\" \u2014Alejandra Rodriguez-Paez, MD, a rheumatologist with the Illinois Joint & Bone Institute Best Odor-Free Aspercreme Odor Free Max Strength Lidocaine Pain Relief Liquid Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Carewell.com Pros Unscented Has a rollerball for easy application Fast-acting Cons Childproof cap may be difficult to remove for people with arthritis in their hands Applicator has a tendency to leak For those who have found that other products with lidocaine work for them, but are either too heavily scented or difficult to apply, this option from Aspercreme is both fragrance-free and designed with a rollerball to make it easier to get the product where you need it. Also, it contains 4 percent lidocaine, which is the maximum amount permitted without a prescription. It works by numbing away joint pain. Price at time of publish: $23 Active Ingredients: Lidocaine | Dose: Apply a thin layer to the affected area every six to eight hours, not to exceed three applications in a 24-hour period | Uses: To numb away minor joint and muscle pain What to Look for in an Arthritis Cream Active Ingredients There are several effective ingredients that relieve pain, inflammation, and stiffness in joints caused by arthritis. Topical anesthetics, like lidocaine, create a surface-level numbing effect wherever they're applied. Natural ingredients like menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, and cinnamon oil create hot and cold sensations on contact and have anti-inflammatory properties to soothe sore joints. The added sensation they create helps dull pain. \"Most agents have cooling agents like menthol or capsaicin,\" says Dr. Rodriguez-Paez. This agent depletes the nerve cells in the area of a chemical that's important for sending pain signals to the brain. \"They cause the skin to feel cool and then warm and they distract the nerve endings from the pain sensation thus relieving pain,\" Dr. Rodriguez-Paez adds. \"Usually the effect is short-lived; it goes away if not used frequently.\" Side Effects Oral medications to relieve arthritis symptoms can sometimes cause gastrointestinal problems, stomach ulcers, and kidney dysfunction. Topical medications, on the other hand, minimize some of those side effects seen in their oral counterparts. \"I believe the side effect profile in general is safe, and patients may have a benefit, which would lead them to avoid using other oral agents that have potential for more side effects,\" Dr. Rodriguez-Paez says. But that doesn't mean these topical agents are for everyone. Because the product is applied directly to the skin, it could cause irritation for people with skin conditions or similar sensitivities. \"Patients with different skin conditions, history of eczema, or sensitive skin may want to use a small amount first to see if it causes problems,\" says Dr. Rodriguez-Paez. If you experience a severe skin reaction to the product, it is best to stop use and speak to your doctor about the ingredients that potentially caused the reaction. Application While rollers and patches may seem convenient, doctors say you may be missing out on one major benefit of using an arthritis cream: the massage. \"The act of actually putting on some of these rubs may be, at least in part, why they're helpful,\" says Dr. Rosian. \"Massaging the cream or gel in and moving around the joints helps with blood flow and modulating the pain around the area.\" Frequently Asked Questions How does arthritis cream work? Arthritis creams\u2014also known as topicals or ointments\u2014work on the area they are applied to either reduce pain, reduce inflammation, or both, according to Dr. Frank.\"[Some] arthritis creams are formulated with salicylates, which can reduce inflammation to the joints when applied topically and lessen pain,\" Niket Sonpal, MD, an internist practicing in New York City, tells Verywell Health. \"Some creams use ingredients known as 'counterirritants,' which actually cause mild irritation or inflammation of the skin to distract the patient from their arthritis' pain. Menthol, or mint oil, is a common counterirritant often used in arthritis creams.\" How often should I apply an arthritis cream? Always read the product's label to guarantee you're using the appropriate dose.\"Many of the products are best used when applied multiple times per day, and so to get the most benefit, patients must be willing to follow the instructions and use appropriately,\" says Dr. Frank. \"As always, talk to your doctor first before starting.\" Can you use arthritis cream while pregnant or breastfeeding? \"Any medication, including arthritis creams or gels, should be discussed with your primary care provider before using\u2014especially if you're pregnant or breastfeeding,\" according to Dr. Frank. \"While topical agents may be of lower risk than oral agents, there is still a risk of systemic absorption, and may be contraindicated while pregnant or breastfeeding\u2014particularly anything containing an NSAID,\" she explains.According to Dr. Sonpal, topical arthritis creams are usually safe for use while pregnant or breastfeeding. \"This is because when treatment, like a cream, is applied topically, the skin absorbs very little of the medication,\" he explains. \"It is unlikely that a harmful amount of medication from the cream will move through your bloodstream into your uterus or your breastmilk, if you are breastfeeding. If you are unsure of whether or not it is safe to use your specific arthritis cream while pregnant or breastfeeding, consult your doctor for a medical opinion.\" Why Trust Verywell Health As a seasoned health writer, Jennifer Nied understands how vital quality product recommendations are for treating symptoms safely and effectively at home.
