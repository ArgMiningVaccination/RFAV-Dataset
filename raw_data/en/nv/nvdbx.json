Although founded in 1887 by a group of Presbyterian ministers and laymen, Occidental has had no formal religious association since 1910. It is governed by a self -perpetuating Board of Trustees, is accredited by th e Accreditation Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges,* and holds membership in a number of regional and national organizations related to higher education. The Delta of California Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Occidental in 1926. The first baccalaureate degree was conferred in 1893, and graduate instruction leading to the Master of Arts degree in selected fields was inaugurated in 1922. Occidental seeks to provide an education of high quality in the best tradition of the liberal arts, emphasizing thorough competence in a chosen field of study together with a broad understanding of our historical and cultural heritage, and the relationships among fields of knowledge. Students and fa culty at Occidental are engaged in an intellectual partnership in which student initiative and responsibility are encouraged. To an unusual degree, students may participate in the construction of their own educational programs. Independent study and interd epartmental programs are encouraged. Occidental students represent varied intellectual interests, socioeconomic backgrounds, racial and ethnic groups, religious beliefs, nationalities, and social and political convictions. This diversity finds its expressi on not only in the variety of academic programs and options open to the student, but also through the entire range of student organizations and enterprises, college cultural events, visiting lecturers, and forums, all of which taken together comprise the m any facets of life in an invigorating academic community. The College is committed to a philosophy of total education. Intellectual capability is a dominant component, but is conceived of as one dimension in a process which includes and stresses personal, ethical, social, and political growth toward maturation as well. The high percentage of students in residence at the College works toward the achievement of this objective. Successful Occidental students are self -motivated, independent -minded and intellectually talented people. They base their judgments upon respect for evidence, ideas, and a deep concern for values, both private and public. They are alert to the possibilities of betterment in themselves, their college, and their society. Above all , they realize that no education is finished, that they are in college to learn how to learn, so that they may carry on their own education for the rest of their lives. Occidental College is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer, and does not discrimina te against employees or applicants because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, or disability. This nondiscrimination policy also covers student access to College programs, includi ng but not limited to academic admissions, financial aid, educational services, and employment. Occidental College is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges 985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100 Alameda, California 94501 (510) 748 -9001 *Sen ior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges: 985 Atlantic Avenue, Suite 100, Alameda, CA 94501 1Mission The mission of Occidental College is to provide a gifted and diverse group of students with a total educational exp erience of the highest quality \u2014one that prepares them for leadership in an increasingly complex, interdependent and pluralistic world. The distinctive interdisciplinary and multicultural focus of the College's academic program seeks to foster both the fulf illment of individual aspirations and a deeply rooted commitment to the public good. This mission is anchored by four cornerstones: excellence, equity, community and service. These building blocks, in one form or another, have long been the basis for the C ollege's commitment to providing responsible leaders and citizens for our democratic society. Choosing them to support the future helps to ensure that the College remains true to its mission while adapting to a changing world.

The Admission Committee seeks students with strong academic preparation and personal characteristics who demonstrate motivation, accomplishment, involvement, ener gy, and commitment. Rigor of coursework, grades, writing, recommendations, extracurricular activities, and test scores are all taken into consideration in selecting the members of the first - year class. While there is no specific requirement for the high sc hool course of study, it is recommended that applicants take five academic subjects each year, including advanced or honors courses when available. The emphasis in each academic area will vary with individual interests and goals, but a solid preparation in high school should include four years of English composition and literature, three to four years of foreign language, three to four years of mathematics (four years for students interested in science or engineering), three to four years of social studies, and three to four years of science \u2014including one year each of biological and physical science. (Students interested in science or engineering should be sure to include both chemistry and physics.) Regular Decision applications for admission into to the fi rst-year class are due by January 15. Students for whom Occidental is their first -choice college may apply under one of two binding Early Decision programs. ED I applications are due November 15, with decisions mailed within a month and ED II applications are due January 1, with decisions also mailed within a month. 8Transfer applications for fall semester should be submitted by April 1, and for the spring semester, transfer applications should be submitted by November 1. International transfer applications are accepted for fall semester only, and should be submitted by April 1. Detailed information on the College, its curriculum and programs, and admission and financial assistance is included in published materials available from the Office of Admission and online at www.oxy.edu/admission- aid. First year and transfer candidates may apply to the College using the Common Application, which includes a required Occidental Supplement. Prospective students are encouraged to experience Occidental firsthand by visiting the College. It is possible to attend an information session, tour the campus, and visit classes. Although interviews are not required, they are strongly recommended. For more information, call 1-800-825- 5262, email admission@oxy.edu , or contact: Office of Admission, Occidental College, 1600 Campus Road, Los Angeles, CA 90041. Academic Information Undergraduate Study Bachelor of Arts Degree Unless mo dified in individual cases by administrative action, the following requirements must be fulfilled by all students to qualify for formal recommendation by the faculty for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: 1. Completion of a minimum of 128 units. 2. Attainment of a 2.0 grade point average or better for all courses undertaken at Occidental College and for the student's entire course of study. 3. Attainment of a 2.0 grade point average or better for all courses undertaken within a departmental major or minor. 4. Satisfaction of the writing proficiency requirement. 5. Completion of the Core Program by the end of the junior year. 6. Language 102 -level proficiency in a language other than English by the end of the third year. See below for Languages Policy. 7. Completion of a major or an Independent Pattern of Study. It is possible to have a double major. 98. Passing of a final comprehensive requirement in the senior year in the major subject or area of concentration, or in the case of those studying under an Independent Pattern of Study, as designed by the student's advisory committee. 9. Fulfillment of all degree requirements, other than the comprehensive examination and work in progress in the final semester, at least six weeks prior to graduation. 10. No Incomplete grades, NR grades, or CIP grade s on the student's transcript at the time of graduation. A minimum of 64 units (exclusive of Occidental -sponsored study -abroad programs) of the required number of units for graduation must be taken by the student at Occidental College to receive the Bachel or of Arts degree. Sixteen units of the last 32 must be Occidental College courses (Study Abroad classes are considered Occidental College courses). Full-time student status is defined by enrollment in twelve or more units; part -time status is defined by enrollment in eleven or fewer units. The degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at the May Commencement upon all candidates who have satisfied degree requirements at any time since the last Commencement. Proficiency in writing Students meet this requiremen t in two stages, the first of which is passing the first -stage Writing Proficiency evaluation in the Cultural Studies Program. Completion of the Cultural Studies courses does not by itself satisfy the writing requirement. There are three measures of profic iency: 1) Fall Semester Professor evaluates the writing of each student using a rubric (1 -6 scale with 4 or above considered proficient). 2) Spring Semester Professor evaluates the writing of each student, using a rubric (1 -6 scale with 4 or above consider ed proficient). 3). One additional measure of writing proficiency is required; most recently this measure has been participation in a shared intellectual experience with required reading which culminates in a timed writing; professors evaluate each student s writing using the 1 -6 score rubric. Frosh are expected to successfully score 4 or better on two of the three measures. Those who do not pass the Cultural Studies Writing evaluations will be asked to pass with a C or better a course in the Department of E nglish Writing (201) or another writing course designated by the Director of Writing Programs in conjunction with the Director of the Core Program. The second stage of the requirement will be met in the student's major department. Each department at the Co llege has specified its own writing requirement in the major; students should consult their department chair. For more information, consult see \"Writing Program\" in the \"Special Programs\" section of this Catalog. Languages All students must achieve Languag e 102 -level proficiency in a language other than English by the end of their third year as part of Occidental's Core requirements. Some majors or minors may have additional language requirements. Placement Exams Students who plan to begin an entirely new l anguage at Occidental are not required to take the placement exam. First-year students may take the Occidental College Placement Examination either on - line for French, German, and Spanish, or during orientation for other languages taught at Occidental if: 101. they have studied a language for a semester in college or for more than one year of high school (ninth grade does not count); 2. they have participated in after -school or weekend language programs; or 3. they have extensive background in but no formal training in a language. Students can fulfill Occidental's language requirement in one of five ways: 1. Completing a language course numbered 102 at Occidental, or the equivalent course in any foreign language at ano ther accredited institution. 2. Receiving an exemption -level score on Occidental's Placement and/or Exemption exam given during Orientation. (see the Language Studio site for language specific details). 3. Earning an appropriate Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) II score (560 or above in French, Spanish, or Latin; 550 or above in German or Chinese; 540 or above in Japanese; or 560 for any other language). 4. Earning an Advanced Placement test score of 4 or above. 5. For some languages not taught at Occidental, students ma y opt to take the ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) and the Writing Proficiency test (WPT) in the languages currently available. Please see the Keck Language and Culture Studio about demonstrating proficiency via ACTFL interviews and tests. Foreign La nguage Exemption Policy International students whose language of education has been in a language other than English and who have completed six years of elementary education or more in a foreign language are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Su ch students should contact the chair of one of the foreign language departments to confirm their fulfillment of the foreign language requirement. The Honors Program The Honors Program at Occidental is designed to allow the superior student's attention to b e focused on an independent investigation for a sustained period of time. It is expected that students admitted to the College Honors Program will have established themselves as outstanding prospects for individualized work in the department of their major and also will have established themselves as submitting work of very high quality in all that they have undertaken at Occidental. Student admission to the College Honors Program will be by formal action of the faculty in the student's major department. Or dinarily no student will be admitted to the College Honors Program who does not have an overall grade point average of 3.25. No student will, under any circumstances, receive Honors who has not maintained this grade point average by the end of spring semes ter of the senior year. Individual departments may set a higher minimum grade point average, both overall and within the major. Students accepted for the College Honors Program are exempt from the eight -unit limit in Independent Study and may take Advanced Research (499) courses on an independent study basis. The purpose of such research is to prepare a special project to be submitted to the major department for evaluation no later than the 10th week of the spring semester of the student's senior year. Eval uation of the completed project will be made by a committee of department faculty and may include readers from outside the department or College. Students wishing to be considered for participation in the Honors Program should contact the chair 11of the appr opriate department during the spring semester of their sophomore year and, in any event, will be admitted to the program no later than the second week of the fall semester of their senior year. Completion of an Honors project does not in itself guarantee t he conferring of College Honors. See also Honors in an \"Independent Pattern of Study\". Honors at Graduation Summa cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.90 or above. Magna cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.75 or above. Cum Laude : Grade point average of 3.50 or above. Grade point averages for Honors are based on work completed at Occidental College. Study Abroad courses taken in the Fall and spring and approved by the International Programs Office are considered Occidental college courses and are calculated in the GPA for honors. No transfer courses are calculated in the Occidental college GPA (study abroad courses taken in the summer are considered transfer courses). Major Concentration The requirements for graduation are determin ed at the time students declare their major. The catalog and policies in place at the time (the current official catalog) determine the students' requirements for the major declared. The student has the option to use any catalog thereafter as long as the s tudent does not take a leave of absence or withdrawals from the college. A student is encouraged to declare a major at any point during the freshman year, and is required to do so not later than registration at the end of the sophomore year. Only under exc eptional circumstances may a major be changed after the end of the junior year and only by special petition to the appropriate Committee. Students are expected to complete those major requirements in effect in the year they declare the major. Unless differ ent regulations are specified under the departmental requirements for graduation, a student who fails to attain a 2.0 grade point average in introductory and intermediate courses within the major will not be accepted by that department as a major. The mini mum number of units for a major is prescribed by individual departments. The maximum units that may be required by a department is 48, but a student who wishes to do so may take more than the required number of units in the major subject. At least 64 units of coursework counting toward the A.B. degree, however, must be taken outside the major department. In any single semester, students are strongly discouraged from taking more than 12 units in a single department. Each department requires senior students i n the major to complete a comprehensive examination, the evaluation of which becomes a part of each student's permanent record and transcript. To double major, a student completes all requirements for the major in each of two separate departments. Students must complete separate comprehensive examinations. Minor Concentration A student is allowed to declare an academic minor, consisting of at least 20 units chosen from a list determined by each department. Students should consult the appropriate department for a list of courses acceptable for the minor. Students who wish to declare minors must do so no later than the fall semester of the senior year. Interinstitutional Programs 123/2 and 4/2 Combined Plan Programs in Liberal Arts and Engineering with Californi a Institute of Technology and Columbia University Cooperative arrangement with Columbia University School of Law Cooperative arrangement with the Keck Graduate Institute Exchanges with Art Center College of Design and California Institute of Technology Independent Pattern of Study Occidental offers students, with the consultation of faculty members, the opportunity to design an Independent Pattern of Study (IPS) in lieu of a major program. An Independent Pattern of Study is appropriate when a student has a strong and well developed motivation to pursue interdisciplinary study in areas where the College does not have a defined program. Such a program is particularly appropriate in newly emerging areas of study. It must, however, be one which is feasible for b oth the College and the student. The student must demonstrate to the faculty involved a record of success in completing previous work in courses, independent study, and other programs. A proposal for an IPS should include (1) a statement of academic purpos e; (2) a program of at least 48 units, including 32 numbered 300 or greater; (3) a proposal for the Comprehensive Project; (4) plans for faculty involvement including regular meetings with the entire committee and (5) an overall GPA of 3.25 or better at the time the IPS proposal is submitted for approval. The program of study must be endorsed by an IPS Committee composed of three members of the faculty, with no more than two faculty from the same department. The procedure for proposing an IPS begins with th e submission of a proposal to the Student Progress Committee no later than six weeks before the end of the sophomore year. (Appropriate forms are available in the Registrar's Office.) The proposal, after any necessary revisions, will be presented by the st udent to the assembled IPS committee in preparation for final submission. Final proposals for IPS must be approved no later than the end of the sophomore year. The student's transcript will have \"Independent Pattern of Study\" listed under the heading of \"M ajor\". The title chosen for the IPS will be identified on the transcript as an emphasis in the major. Honors in an Independent Pattern of Study College Honors may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in Independent Pattern of Study c ourse work and in an honors thesis/project. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 or better grade point average in courses taken for their IPS and an overall 3.25 grade point average. Qualified students who wish to pursue Honors must consult with their IPS committee during their junior year and submit a proposal for honors thesis/project no later than mid - term of the second semester of their junior year. Pre-Professional Courses The plan of undergraduate study at Occidental emphasizes a liberal education of the type that is generally recognized as desirable preparation for professional or vocational fields. Opportunity is afforded, however, for flexibility in developing programs suited to students' individual needs and in providing for the subjec ts which are specified by many professional schools as a basis for graduate study. Suggestions concerning adaptation of majors to preparation for various vocational and professional fields are included in departmental announcements in this catalog. Student s are encouraged, beginning in the freshman year, to utilize the services of the Career Development Center, where detailed information concerning vocational opportunities and preparation may be obtained. The Career Development Center offers counseling to h elp 13students become aware of their potential and how that potential may be used productively during and after the college experience. Graduate Study Occidental College offers graduate study in academic areas for which the College is able to provi de distinctive offerings at the graduate level. Admission to graduate study is competitive, and the number of students admitted is sufficiently small to ensure flexibility in arranging individual programs of study within a general framework of policies tha t assure high academic standards. The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is offered in the Biology department. Admission Graduates of accredited colleges and universities are eligible to apply for graduate study at Occidental. Preference is given to applicants w ith superior preparation and achievement. Graduate students are admitted subject to the general regulations of the College. Applications for the Master of Arts in Biology are available in the Graduate Office. Applications and all admission credentials for graduate study must be received by March 1 for students applying to begin study during the Summer Session, or the Fall Semester, and by October 1 for students applying to begin study during the Spring Semester. Students seeking admission to the M.A. progra m must have significant successful experience in the discipline to be ready for graduate study. Evidence of readiness includes undergraduate grades, completion of an undergraduate major or minor in the discipline, successful completion of a significant amo unt of course work at or above the advanced undergraduate level, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) general and subject test scores. Consultation with the department chair is recommended before completing the application, particularly for students who h ave not completed an undergraduate major in the discipline. 14Completed applications must include the following: 1. A completed application form, including a statement of objectives for graduate work. 2. Application fee of $60. (This fee is waived for current and former Occidental students.) 3. Official transcripts of all academic work at the college or university level, including previous graduate work. 4. Letters of recommendation from three persons. These should include, if possible, one letter from a professor in the applicant's major field of undergraduate study. 5. An official report of test scores from the Graduate Record Examination General Test. 6. An official report of test scores for the Graduate Record Examination Subject Test in Biology. 7. For applicants whose native language is not English, an official report of test scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language. (This requirement is waived for current and former Occidental students.) Applications for the M.A. in Biology must be submitted directly to th e Graduate Office. Financial Aid Financial aid for graduate study is available from the College on the basis of financial need and academic promise. In order to be eligible for available funds, applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal Studen t Aid (FAFSA) online and a separate Financial Aid Application for Graduate Students to the Financial Aid Office by April 19, prior to the academic school year of intended matriculation. All other required supplemental documents (tax returns, W -2s and verif ication documents) must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office by April 19. Application forms and a list of required supplemental forms may be obtained from the Graduate Office or the Financial Aid Office. Candidacy for Advanced Degrees Candidacy for an advanced degree is granted to a student whose undergraduate preparation provides a thoroughly satisfactory background for the graduate work proposed. In some instances, a student who does not meet all the departmental course requirements for admission may be admitted to graduate standing but not to candidacy for the degree until specified prerequisite courses are completed. When the background courses have been completed at a level of achievement satisfactory to the student's major department, the departmen t will recommend to the Graduate Office that the student be advanced to candidacy for the master's degree. Plan of Study for Candidates for the M.A. Degree At the time of acceptance for graduate study, each degree candidate is assigned a major advisor. The student and the advisor share the joint responsibility to formulate a consistent plan of study that is within the policies of the College and the major department. The plan of study should include a schedule for meeting all degree requirements. Credit for a graduate degree may be given for Occidental courses (including summer offerings) numbered 500 and above, but not for any course taken in fulfillment of requirements for a Bachelor's degree. As a general policy, the College does not accept transfer gradu ate credit from other institutions; however, students receiving Veterans Benefits should submit documentation of their prior graduate work to the Graduate Office for evaluation of potential credit toward their degree. Courses numbered 500 and above are ordinarily limited to graduate students. However, advanced and specially qualified undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in such courses by special petition to the instructor, the department chair, and the Director of Graduate Studies. In special circumst ances, by additional petition to the Director of Graduate Studies, 15credit toward the Master of Arts degree also may be granted provided the course is not required to fulfill a Bachelor's degree. Graduate full -time status is nine or more units. Degree Requi rements - Master of Arts 1. Completion of a minimum of 30 units (six courses) of graduate work at Occidental, achieving a grade of B (3.0) or higher in every course 1. Not less than one -half of the work shall be completed in the student's major department. The remainder shall be chosen, with the approval of the advisor and the major department chair, from related upper -division courses in other departments to form a consistent plan of study. 2. M.A. students in Biology must register once for thesis credit by enrol ling in Biology 590, Thesis for Master of Arts Degree (5 units). This course may count toward the 30 -units requirement. 2. Satisfactory completion of a thesis. The relevant material shall be presented to the Graduate Office in approved form as specified in t he general instructions issued to degree candidates. The Special Collections Librarian will issue an acknowledgment of receipt to the student. This receipt shall be submitted to the Graduate Office as proof that the thesis has been submitted. 3. Passing of a final examination demonstrating a thorough grasp of the candidate's field of emphasis. The supervising committee for this examination shall consist of three faculty members, with the student's advisor as the chair. The committee shall include at least one faculty member of a department other than the student's major department. 4. Other degree requirements specified by the major department in the College Catalog. 5. All degree requirements must be completed no later than five calendar years after the date of i nitial enrollment as a graduate student. Thesis Candidate Status for M.A. Students M.A. students who have completed all course work and are continuing thesis work may enroll in Thesis Candidate Status. This status grants student privileges and allows the College to certify enrollment. A student may enroll in this status for a maximum of two semesters and must be either normally enrolled or in Thesis Candidate Status in the semester in which he or she graduates. Final Approval of Candidacy for the M.A. Degr ee The Master of Arts degree is conferred upon candidates formally recommended by the faculty on the basis of approval by (a) the candidate's supervising committee, and (b) the Director of Graduate Studies. Such approval is contingent upon completing all d egree requirements. In addition, candidates must present to the Graduate Office an application for final approval of candidacy for the degree, including signed recommendations from the members of the supervising committee. Graduate degrees will be dated as of the end of the semester in which the Registrar certifies that all College and departmental degree requirements have been met. For those candidates who wish to participate in May Commencement ceremonies, all evidence of degree completion must be receive d in the Graduate Office by April 1. Probation Policy for Graduate Students Students who do not maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher in all coursework after admission to the graduate program will be placed on academic probation. 16 Academic Policies The academic year at Occidental College consists of two 15 -week semesters, each including one week of final examinations. A student may register each semester for a maximum of 18 units. Students electing to enroll for fewer than 16 units in any semester during their course of study at Occidental must be aware they may not be making normal academic progress and must accept the consequences of a possible delayed graduation date. Only by special petition to the Dean of Students and under the most unusual circumstances may students reduce their academic load to fewer than 12 units. Students may petition to be part time through the last day to drop classes. After that date students may only withdraw from a class and the enrollment status will no t change. Courses Each unit of course credit at Occidental College requires a minimum of three hours of student work per week, for every week over the duration of a semester. As such, each four -unit course represents a minimum of 12 hours of involvement pe r week, and each two -unit course represents a minimum of 6 hours of involvement per week. Students will typically spend a third of this time in direct interaction with faculty, and the remainder of the time will be spent preparing for class. Faculty may ch oose to set expectations for student involvement differently while maintaining a reasonable approximation of the minimum requirement. Faculty might also require, or students might choose, to spend more hours than the minimum requirement. This definition ho lds for all types of courses (e.g., lecture, seminar, independent study, lab, practicum, etc.) regardless of the amount of credit offered. Courses numbered 1 -80 are those in the first -year Cultural Studies component of the Core Program. 100 - level courses a re introductory, open to first- year students. 200 -level courses are designed primarily for second -year students. 300- level courses are intended primarily for juniors and seniors and 400 -level courses are advanced courses, usually open only to seniors. 500 -level courses are intended for graduate students. 17Courses numbered 500 and above are ordinarily limited to graduate students. However, advanced and specially qualified undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in such courses by special petition to the instructor, the department chair, and the Director of Graduate Studies. In special circumstances, by additional petition to the Director of Graduate Studies, credit toward the Master of Arts degree may also be granted provided the course is not required to fu lfill a Bachelor's degree. Occasionally students seek to repeat a course in which they earned a passing grade. Credit is not awarded for the repeated course; both grades are averaged into the grade average, and both courses and grade appear on the transcri pt. Changes in course offerings after publication of the catalog for 2011 -2012 will be reflected in the online catalog. Any undergraduate course in which fewer than 10 students are enrolled at the beginning of a semester may be cancelled. Registration Registration procedures are outlined in materials supplied by the Registrar. The Business Office and the Registrar must approve each student's enrollment. Students who clear their registration late will incur a Business Office fee. Registration must be com pleted within the first week of the semester, or the student may be denied credit for the semester's work. Spring semester registration for freshmen is considered final only upon verification in the Office of the Registrar that these students have met thei r requirements in the Cultural Studies Program for the preceding semester. Regularly scheduled courses offered for one or two units may be available for registration through the seventh week of the semester (mid -term) with faculty approval. There is a two - unit limit for courses added at this time. The Registrar will announce the exact dates for the deadline. Adding, Dropping, and Withdrawing from Classes 1) Adding Classes: Students may add classes during the first week of each semester, with the permissi on of the instructor. Exact deadline dates are published by the Registrar in the online academic calendar. Students wishing to add a class during this period may do so by asking the instructor to submit an online override allowing them to register for the class online. (Alternatively, students may file a Schedule Adjustment form with the Registrar's Office, available from that office and online at the Registrar's web page, which must be signed by the instructor and the student's adviser.) Some 1 and 2 un it fractional courses have later deadlines for adding, as noted in the online academic calendar. Students wishing to add a class after its deadline must petition the Registrar and, if approved, pay a late add fee. Students are responsible for verifying in their online records that they have in fact enrolled in and/or added all classes for which they expect to receive credit. 2) Dropping Classes : Students may drop a course without a recorded grade through the sixth week of the semester. The exact Drop dea dline is published by the Registrar in the online academic calendar. To drop a class, students must submit a properly completed Schedule Adjustment form (available in the Registrar's Office and online) to the Registrar in advance of the deadline. Students may not drop first -year CSP courses unless they are withdrawing from the College (see below). Students are responsible for making sure that they have dropped or withdrawn from classes that they are not attending. They will receive a grade of F in any s uch class not dropped or withdrawn from. 3) Withdrawing from Classes: After the sixth week (starting at the seventh week), students may withdraw from a course by submitting a completed Course Withdrawal form (available online and in the 18Registrar's Offic e) to the Registrar through the last day of classes. A notation of \"W\" will appear on the transcript. See the academic calendar for specific drop and withdraw dates. \"W\" grades are not calculated in the GPA. Students may not drop any freshman courses in t he Cultural Studies Program except by special petition to the Core Office. Course Withdrawal forms must be submitted to the Registrar by the end of the final day of classes. Unless a course is officially dropped or withdrawn from, a grade of F may be incur red. Students should be aware that dropping or withdrawing from classes may put them behind normal progress toward the A.B. degree, and may have significant consequences for financial aid, major completion, and graduation. Such decisions should be discuss ed with the academic adviser and, where appropriate, with the Financial Aid office. Course Load (full -time, part -time, and overloads) Normally, students are limited to 18 units of enrollment per semester. However, students with at least 32 units and whose overall GPA is at least 3.0 may enroll in up to 20 units on a space -available basis (on or after the first day of classes); the deadline for adding classes applies. Other students may seek approval of a petition to enroll in an overload submitted to the Registrar; in general, overload petitions from students in their first year at Occidental or with an overall GPA of less than 2.7 will not be approved. Petitions must be submitted prior to the deadline for adding classes. Undergraduate full -time status is twelve or more units. Part-time status is eleven or fewer units. Graduate full -time status is nine or more units. Study Plans Each student is assigned an academic advisor on the basis of expressed interests, and together with the advisor, plans a progr am of study. All courses for which the student wishes to register for credit must be entered on the computer -assisted registration system. A student is responsible for every course entered. Students will not be allowed to attend classes or participate in C ollege activities until registration has been completed. After registration, official changes of courses may be made only through official drop/add forms approved by the instructors who teach the courses and by the Registrar. One week is allowed for adding classes; eight weeks are allowed for course drops without transcript notation. Unless a course is officially dropped or withdrawn, a grade of F will be incurred. Independent Study Independent Studies are courses designed for self -reliant and motivated stu dents to pursue intellectual inquiry outside of regularly scheduled course offerings. These are to be supervised by faculty members, generally involving substantial, close student -faculty interactions. Each course shall be initiated on an individual basis between a student and a faculty member. Enrollment shall be through courses numbered 197, 297 (lower division), 397 (upper division), or 597 (graduate) in the respective department, and must be accompanied by a completed independent study contract. Specifications 1. Advanced planning is essential. There should be some evidence that the student's background is adequate for the proposed study. 192. The independent study contract must be completed, signed and submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the deadline t o add deadline of the appropriate semester. 3. Sophomore, junior and senior students may enroll in one independent study per semester. Freshmen interested in enrolling in an independent study must complete a petition for special consideration and have it approved. 4. Students are required to have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. 5. An independent study course cannot be used to satisfy Core requirements. 6. All independent study courses are two units except those classified under 7 below. Requirements for a two- unit independent study: 1. The contract must include a reading list or equivalent, along with the requirements to be met before a grade can be assigned. 2. The contract requires the signature of the instructor, and the approval of the Student Progress Committe e. 3. The course will be graded CR/NC. If used for a major/minor and justified on the Independent Study form, a letter grade may be issued. 4. If a major/minor has been declared and the department has accepted the independent study as meeting a requirement wit hin that major/minor, the course will be assigned a letter grade. 5. A course already graded CR/NC may not be used to satisfy major/minor requirements. Petitions for retroactively changing CR/NC grades will not be approved. 7. Four-unit independent study cours es are to be taken only for fulfillment of approved major/minor requirements. Requirements for a four -unit independent study: 1. Application for the course must be submitted prior to the end of the previous semester to allow time for approval. 2. The student mu st have a declared major/minor recorded in the Office of the Registrar prior to enrolling in the independent study. 3. The course must be used within the major/minor to meet a requirement approved by the department. 4. The contract must include a reading list or equivalent, along with the requirements to be met before a grade can be assigned. 5. The contract requires the signature of the instructor and the chair of the department, and the approval of the Student Progress Committee. 6. A four- unit independent study wi ll be assigned a letter grade. No CR/NC grades will be allowed. 8. A maximum of eight units of independent study courses may be applied toward graduation. It is expected that students will satisfy Core, foreign language, and academic major/minor course requi rements through regularly scheduled courses. Internships Overview Occidental College offers a variety of internship opportunities. These include internships with community groups, public agencies, businesses, and social justice advocacy organizations, among others. The opportunities include course -related internships that provide connections to community organizations, public agencies, private entities, and non -profit organizations; career -oriented internships offered through the Career Development Cent er in all occupational areas of interest; summer research internships connected to various programs, such as through the International Programs Office, the Urban & Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI), the Undergraduate Research Center, the Center for Com munity -Based Learning, and other College entities; study abroad internships offered through various study abroad programs; and community 20engagement internships based on long term partnerships that are linked to courses and programs supported by the Center for Community -Based Learning, the student Office of Community Engagement, and UEPI. Internships are offered in Los Angeles, throughout the U.S., and in countries abroad such as China. Internships represent a crucial component of Occidental College's missio n and vision associated with community engagement, collaborative relationships, critical thinking and reflection, participant observation, skill development, and career discernment and training. Each of those opportunities are described below. Academic (pr acticums, etc.) Opportunities Several courses and practicums provide valuable internship experiences or fieldwork experience. Academic Practicums offer four units of credit provide faculty mentorship and allow students to thoroughly integrate applied learn ing in organizations of interest within the context of a given course. For example, the Urban and Environmental Policy Department offers a course on \"Community Organizing\" that includes an internship requirement with a community -based organization working on a key community objective. The Politics Department offers a course providing internships and linkages with Public Interest Law firms; Psychology offers fieldwork for psychology and social services -bound students, and several Departments have come togeth er to create a Public Health cluster and create courses that include internships with places like health clinics and with such partners as promotoras (community health workers). These academic/course based opportunities, in turn, can lead to summer interns hips as well as continuing ties (and even future employment) with the partner community groups and organizations. Career Exploration Opportunities The Career Development Center (CDC) supports internships that integrate knowledge and theory learned in the c lassroom and applied in a professional setting. Internship opportunities are available in all occupational sectors and may or may not directly correlate with a student's major. Internships are an opportunity to create learning experiences for the student b y providing exposure in a career field or job function of interest. Through diverse occupational exposure, students can explore various careers, thereby greatly enhancing their progression towards career discernment while building transferable skills towar d graduate and employment opportunities. Students can secure nonprofit, governmental and for -profit opportunities. Additionally, the CDC sponsors a broad -based, funded internship program in Los Angeles and Portland, that places students in full -time profe ssional internships for ten weeks during the summer. Through the CDC, Occidental College offers both a two unit (INT 200) and a zero unit (INT 100) option for students. The CDC coordinates both courses and supports students during their INT 200 and INT 100 internship (see Career Center INT Program below). Community -Based Learning (CBL) Opportunities Internships supported by the Center for Community Based Learning (CCBL) allow students to continue work initiated as part of a community based learning and/or r esearch course. Internships are defined in partnership with community partners, faculty, and the CCBL. A CCBL internship allows students to continue to develop skills in community engagement, community based research, and other professional skills, while providing ongoing support for projects that cannot be completed within a single semester. Depending on the focus and structure of the internship, a student can earn 2 units through the CDC internship program and receive a stipend from the CCBL. CCBL also su pports community engaged courses through its Education in Action (EIA) program where students receive a stipend to support faculty in facilitating the community aspect of the course. International Opportunities 21Over half of Occidental's four -dozen semester and summer study abroad programs include opportunities for internships or community -engaged projects. Participants test theories, concepts, and competencies encountered on campus in dynamic intercultural settings and set a course for global citizenship. M ost earn academic credit and some tackle significant research projects. From Amsterdam to Rabat, from Cape Town to Lima, from Tokyo to Beijing, participants expect to grow in their capacity to lead in a complex world, contribute to solving transnational pr oblems, compete in the global workforce, and thrive in intercultural situations. Students consider community engagement abroad among their most power learning experiences. Career Development Center INT Internship Program Internships for credit must be educ ational experiential opportunities that meet the criteria established by Occidental and approved by the Career Development Center (CDC). Students must be able to complete a minimum of 80 hours per semester of experiential learning in order to enroll in eit her internship course and receive credit (INT 100 or INT 200). To meet this requirement, students are advised to register within the first two weeks of the semester; however, internships may be approved until mid -semester. Students must register in the app ropriate internship course (see below) by listed deadlines. For either course option, it is required that students have sophomore, junior, and senior and at least part- time, registered in at least six units, status. Additionally, students must have a cumul ative GPA of 2.0 or better at the time of application for internship credit. Only CR/NC grades will be given for internships. Students are only allowed to enroll in one internship course per semester. All students enrolled in an internship, whether for two units or zero units, must complete a reflective essay and internship evaluation, as instructed by the CDC. The CDC will also request two performance evaluations (mid and final) from the listed on -site internship supervisor. Students are obliged to notify CDC, faculty supervisor, and on -site supervisor before dropping or withdrawing from an internship as well as submit the appropriate paperwork to the Office of the Registrar. Retroactive enrollment will not be approved and credit not be issued even in cases where an internship has been completed. Students enrolling in an internship course for the summer will be charged reduced fees for units. See the summer website or consult the CDC, the Office of the Registrar, or the Student Accounts Office for fee inform ation. Summer Internship program Students will be allowed to take a zero -unit internship over the summer immediately after graduation. This is a one -time summer program for students who have graduated in May of the same year. The students will need to comp lete an \"Application for a Limited Special Student -Undergraduate\", the \"Summer Registration\" and the \"Internship application\" form prior to the beginning of the summer to qualify for this program. Students will be required to complete all course assignment s prior to receiving credit for the course. This includes a survey and an essay on the internship. On-Campus Internship Policy In an interest to provide increased opportunities for students studying in Los Angeles, the institution is authorizing on -campus internship opportunities that would allow students to intern on campus and receive credit through the Career Development Center Internship Program (INT100 and INT200). On -campus internships are distinct from the institution Work Study Program and various on-campus leadership programs by providing project based exposure in professional occupational areas, whereby the primary goal is that the student intern is the beneficiary of professional learning. On -campus departments wishing to create internship posit ions or willing to host a student intern by student request, must work with the CDC to assure that they are developing an internship opportunity that ascribes to the department's criteria. To assure student learning of the highest caliber, the department's philosophy is to set on -campus internships to the same rigorous standard ascribed to internships available in for -profit and public service organizations. 22For a complete outline of requirements and policy surrounding on -campus opportunities, please contac t the Internship Coordinator at the Career Development Center. The College recognizes two categories of internships: 1. Two -unit internship (INT 200) - The maximum credits awarded for an internship will be two units. The total units earned through internsh ips may not exceed four units (students may take additional internships for zero units, which will appear on the transcript). In addition to the criteria listed above, the student must secure an on -campus faculty supervisor to assign, supervise, and approv e the academic component of the internship. The faculty supervisor must be a full -time faculty member on -campus. The reflective component and performance evaluations, coordinated by the CDC, are shared with the faculty supervisor and may be used at the dis cretion of the faculty supervisor when grading the internship. 2. Zero -unit internship (INT 100) - This course is offered for no credits, but the internship will be listed on the student's transcript. Course is coordinated and monitored by the CDC. Student and internship must meet the criteria listed above. Students failing to participate in the reflective component coordinated by the CDC will not receive credit for their internship. Withdrawal from the College, Leave of Absence, and Readmission to the Coll ege 1) Withdrawal from the College: A student experiencing severe academic or personal disruptions during a semester may petition to withdraw from all course work and receive grades of \"W\" in their classes. Students considering Withdrawal from the Colle ge should discuss their situations with academic advisers, the Dean of Students' Office, and/or the Associate Dean of the College for Student Issues. A petition for Withdrawal must be filed with the Registrar's Office before the final day of classes in th e semester of withdrawal. The withdrawing student must complete a \"leave/withdrawal\" form (available in the Registrar's Office and online) indicating that they have made appropriate arrangements with the offices of Student Accounts, Financial Aid, and Res idential Education and Housing Services. Students on Academic Probation who petition for Withdrawal from the College may be required by the Student Progress Committee to spend an additional semester's Leave of Absence away from Occidental, take college courses elsewhere, and apply for readmission to the College (see below). 2) Leave of Absence: Students may apply to take an approved Leave of Absence from Occidental College for academic or personal reasons. The Leave may be approved for one or more semest ers, and it must be taken beginning in the semester immediately following its approval. Students considering a Leave of Absence should consult with their academic advisers, the Dean of Students' Office, and/or the Associate Dean of the College for Student Issues. Application for a Leave of Absence should be made directly to the Registrar's Office, which may consult with the Student Progress Committee before approval. If a Leave is approved, the student must complete a \"Leave/Withdrawal\" form (available i n the Registrar's Office and online) indicating that they have made appropriate arrangements with the offices of Student Accounts, Financial Aid, and Residential Education and Housing Services. 3) Readmission to the College Following Withdrawal or Leave of Absence : Students who have petitioned successfully to take a Leave of Absence, or who have been required to take a Leave of Absence following Withdrawal from the College while on Academic Probation, or who have been subjected to Academic Suspension (se e \"Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal\"), must submit a \"Returning Student Application\" at least thirty days prior to their intended return to Occidental, outlining (among other things) what they have done during their absence from the College an d a detailed plan for academic success upon return. This form is available in the Registrar's Office and online, and will be evaluated for 23approval by the Student Progress Committee. Students planning such a return are urged to consult in advance with th e Grades Scholastic standing of both undergraduate and graduate students is indicated by the following grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, satisfactory; D, barely passing; F, failure. A grade of Incomplete (INC) may be used for an undergraduate and Deferred (DEF) for a graduate under conditions outlined below. A grade of Course in Progress (CIP) is given to indicate that a course is still in progress at the end of the semester. A W grade indicates the student withdrew from a course after the eighth week of th e semester or has withdrawn from the College at any time during the semester. CR/NC grades, used in certain courses, are described below. When a charge of academic misconduct is pending, a grade of NR is given; it will be changed to a letter grade when the pending judicial or other matter is resolved. An Incomplete (INC) indicates that although the work completed is of passing grade, some portion of the course remains unfinished because of illness or for some other reason over which the student had no contr ol. A student must petition prior to the last day of classes to receive an INC grade. Except under extraordinary circumstances, any student who has two Incompletes on the record from previous semesters cannot petition for an additional one. This grade, whi ch must be approved by a dean or an associate dean, will be removed and replaced by a letter grade upon completion of the course requirements with a notation on the official transcript. The maximum time allowed for completion of course requirements, whethe r the student is enrolled or not, is one year from the date the Incomplete was incurred. At that time the grade will revert to the default grade submitted by the professor. A graduate student's grade may be Deferred (DEF) by the instructor who specifies th e time within which the coursework is to be completed, the limit not to exceed one year except in the case of M.A. theses. If not removed within the specified time, a Deferred grade generally becomes an F. Instructors file written statements of reasons for assigning Incompletes and Failures with their grade reports at the end of each semester. In the case of an Incomplete, the statement indicates the work necessary to attain a final grade. A copy of this statement is given to the student. Academic Ethics Students are responsible for meeting a high ethical standard in their academic work. Academic misconduct occurs when a student misrepresents others work as her/his own or otherwise behaves so as to advantage unfairly her/himself or another student academic ally. Any member of the Occidental community who believes that a student has engaged in misconduct of academic work should promptly report the possible misconduct to the Judicial Examiner. The Judicial Examiner is a disinterested third party who will ensur e that procedures designed to respect the rights and responsibilities of all involved are followed. Key concepts, definitions, roles, procedures, and sanctions that constitute the policy by which charges of academic misconduct are handled can be found in t he Student Handbook. Grade Appeal Policy This policy refers to procedures related to the dispute of a final grade in a class. Individual grades within a class may not be appealed and grade changes for additional work done after the semester has ended will not be approved. For grade disputes involving a claim of harassment or discrimination on the basis of disability, instead follow the Disability Services grievance policy described here. The presumption at Occidental is that the instructor alone is qualifie d to evaluate the academic work of students in his or her courses and to assign grades to that work. Consequently, grades are not normally 24subject to appeal. However, when a student believes that a particular grade was assigned unfairly or in error, the st udent may appeal the assigned grade as follows: 1. A final grade in a class must be appealed by the end of the fourth week of the semester following the semester in which the grade was issued. No grade may be appealed after this period. Students are responsible for reviewing their grades at the conclusion of a semester. 2. The first step in the appeal is for the student to discuss any concerns with the instructor. 3. If discussion between the faculty member and the student does not resolve the matter, the student should meet with the department/program chair and provide the chair with a written explanation of the student's concern. The chair will attempt to solve the problem. If the instructor is also the chair, the student should meet with the Associate Dean respo nsible for the department within which the course was given. 4. If the department/program chair is unable to resolve the situation, the student may present the appeal to the Associate Dean responsible for the department within which the course was given. The Associate Dean will bring the matter to the Student Progress Committee, which will review the appeal and make a recommendation to the Associate Dean. The Associate Dean, who will confer with both the student and the instructor, shall review the appeal and the recommendation by the Student Progress Committee. The Associate Dean shall determine the final resolution. No further appeals are possible after the Associate Dean has issued a decision. Credit/No Credit The Credit/No Credit policy is intended to enc ourage students to explore classes in unfamiliar fields without the risk of incurring a low grade because of that unfamiliarity. It is not intended to allow students a partial exit from classes in which they are doing badly, and for that reason Credit/No Credit contracts must be completed early in the semester and are irreversible. With the exception of required courses, including foreign language, Core, and major and minor requirements, a student may take a course on a Credit/No Credit basis with the con sent of the instructor. To do so, a contract for completion of work to be graded CR/NC must be filed with the Registrar as soon as possible and not later than the fourth week of the semester, and the decision may not be changed after the CR/NC form is subm itted to the Registrar's office. No forms will be accepted after the deadline. If the major or minor is changed to one that requires a course that has already been taken on a Credit/No Credit basis, the student may be required to take an examination in tha t course for a grade. A grade of Credit (CR) is to be regarded as the equivalent of a C or better only. Grades of CR or NC are excluded from grade averaging. Physical Activities Credit Students are awarded one unit of credit for each physical activities course taken, up to a maximum of four units toward graduation. Only one physical activities unit per semester will be allowed. Students may enroll in additional physical activities courses for zero units. Auditors Any regularly registered full -time student may audit one four -unit course each semester, without fee, subject to permission of the instructor. All petitions to audit must be filed by the add deadline for the appropriate semester. Courses that require extensive student participation (such as studio art) may not be audited. Students not registered for credit may attend courses as auditors, subject to formal permission through 25forms available in the Office of the Registrar and upon payment of Auditors' fees. An auditor may not participate actively in course work or take final examinations and therefore does not receive credit. A grade of Audit is entered on the permanent record if requested by the student and if requirements specified by the instructor are met. Dean's List Full-time students who comple te at least sixteen units for a letter grade in a fall or spring semester and have a semester GPA of 3.5 or better are eligible for the Dean's List. This honor will appear on the student's transcript for each qualifying semester. Class Attendance Regular c lass attendance is expected of all students. Although the recording of attendance is at the discretion of the instructor, students may not enroll for two courses that have any overlap in time. Faculty have the option of administratively dropping from cours es any students who fail to attend the first two hours of any class in a given semester. Students are responsible for arranging with the instructor the manner in which work, missed through absence, will be made up. Scholarship Requirements A grade point av erage of 2.0 in all work taken at Occidental and in the major and minor, if any, is required for graduation. The College uses two criteria to establish the scholastic status of a student: (1) that based on the 2.0 average and (2) that based on the number o f courses successfully completed with respect to the total number of courses taken (normal academic progress). Grade point average (GPA) is computed on a four -point scale: A equals 4.0, A - equals 3.7, B+ equals 3.3, B equals 3.0, B - equals 2.7, C+ equals 2 .3, C equals 2.0, C - equals 1.7, D+ equals 1.3, D equals 1.0, and F equals 0.0. Courses graded CR/NC are not computed in the grade point average. Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal Occidental College requires 128 units of coursework completed with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better for graduation with the A.B. degree. At the close of each semester, the Student Progress Committee reviews the records of all students whose semester or cumulative GPA is below 2.0 or who have received at least one grade of F for the semester. Students whose semester or cumulative GPA is below 2.0 will normally be placed on academic probation for the following semester. (First -year students finishing their first semester \u2014not transfers \u2014will be placed on probation if the GPA is below 1.85.) In addition, some students with GPAs at or slightly above 2.0 may be placed on probation if they appear to be making unsatisfactory progress toward meeting graduation requirements (through withdrawals, Incompletes, dropped courses, etc.). The purpose of academic probation is not punitive; its intention is to alert students to developing problems that may jeopardize their eventual graduation from Occidental, and to urge them to take immediate action to address these problems. Stude nts placed on academic probation will receive a letter announcing this status, with requirements that they consult with the Dean of Students' Office and their academic advisers to devise a plan for academic success and a return to good academic standing. 26Students who achieve a GPA below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters are subject to suspension . In making this determination the Student Progress Committee will consider not only the GPA but also progress toward the degree, patterns of academic improvement o r deterioration, and special circumstances. Suspension is intended to provide students with serious difficulties with time to rethink their academic strategies and relation to Occidental College, with the purpose of having them either return for a success ful academic career at Occidental or develop a more successful educational plan elsewhere. It may be assigned for one semester or two immediately following the Committee's decision. Suspended students are generally required to do coursework at another in stitution and complete it satisfactorily before readmission to Occidental, which must occur following the guidelines for readmission after a Withdrawal from the College or Leave of Absence (see \"Withdrawal from the College, Leave of Absence, and Readmissio n to the College\"). Specific requirements for suspended students are set forth in letters sent to them notifying them of the Committee's decision. Students who achieve a GPA of 0.75 or below in any semester will normally be automatically suspended for the following semester. Students earning GPAs below 2.0 for three consecutive semesters will normally be automatically suspended for one year. When the Student Progress Committee determines that a student's chances of success at Occidental are minimal or non e, it may impose Dismissal. Dismissed students are not given the option of applying for readmission. Examinations The decision is left to the instructor whether a final examination is held in a course at the close of the semester. Final examinations may no t be administered before the scheduled examination period; take -home examinations may not be issued to students before the final day of classes as published in the College Catalog. With the exception of laboratory practica, no test or examination may be ad ministered in the final week of classes. The time of an examination can be changed within the examination period if there is unanimous agreement from students in the class and if an appropriate room can be found by the Registrar. Examination times are post ed on the Final Examination Schedule with the exception of courses offered at an irregular time. Comprehensive Examinations Comprehensive examinations, required of all seniors for graduation, have two central and related objectives: 1. To provide an opportunity for senior students to synthesize the essential concepts, content, and methods of their academic field, and, during the course of their review, to establish central relationships among the materials covered in separate courses. 2. To provide an o pportunity for students to demonstrate competence in their field by applying their knowledge to central relational problems, questions, or topics. Since no single type of examination experience will serve all academic fields with equal effectiveness, depa rtments have freedom to set either a single examination or a related group of synthesizing experiences as constituting the Comprehensive. Related experiences may include, but are not limited to, seminars, theses, creative projects, field research projects, and oral examinations. Any collective experience that is evaluated by the department rather than an individual instructor, and that in the opinion of the department works toward the objectives and embodies the characteristics described above, may be const rued as meeting the intent of the Comprehensive requirement. 27All departments, regardless of the nature and form of the comprehensive examination, are required to provide opportunities for students who fail their comprehensives to retake them before the end of the academic year in order that they might be given another chance to satisfy departmental expectations before graduation. Departments are granted the autonomy to determine the date and time of the initial examination as well as the re - taking of the e xamination. Departments have the right to waive course final examinations during a semester in which the central portion of the comprehensive is administered. In place of a letter grade for evaluating comprehensive examinations, a three -category system is used: Pass with Distinction, Pass, and Fail. Graduation Ceremony Participation Requirements Normally students are required to meet all requirements for the degree to participate in the commencement ceremony. The college will accept petitions to participate in the ceremony if a student has met all core requirements, all major requirements, successfully completed senior comprehensives and has completed a minimum of 124 units. Students receiving a failing grade required for Core, major or comps at the end of t he second semester of the senior year will not be eligible to participate in that year ceremony. Course Credit by Examination In order to stimulate a maximum amount of effort and progress in students of high scholastic achievement and capacity for self -directed study, the faculty provides an opportunity to pass by examination many of the courses within the curriculum. It is recognized that not all courses (e.g., independent study) nor all subject matter fields lend themselves equally to such an approach. St udents seeking to take specified courses through examination are required to consult with departments and instructors for information as to content and coverage. Credit by Examination may only be undertaken by consent of the instructor in the course. In co urses where multiple sections are scheduled during a semester or in different semesters, the approval of the departmental chair is also required. Students seeking Credit by Examination should secure the necessary petition forms from the Registrar. A studen t may take one course by examination in any semester either as a substitute for a course or in addition to a normal load, which if passed would count toward the total number of units required for graduation, provided the following standards are met. 1. The st udent must have received no grade lower than a B in the two previous semesters at Occidental. 2. Preparation for the examination must be undertaken by the student independently and individually, as directed by the instructor involved, and the student will not be allowed to prepare for the examination by class attendance as an auditor in the regular course. 3. A student may not apply for Credit by Examination in a course in which previously enrolled for all or part of a semester, or in a course audited in a pr evious semester. 4. After a date is set for the examination, the student cannot be excused from taking the examination at that time except for reasons of health or grave emergency. Failure to take the examination will result in a recorded grade of F. With th e consent of the instructor, Credit by Examination may be taken on a Credit/No Credit basis. 285. A grade must be submitted to the Registrar for recording as Credit by Examination, which becomes part of the student's permanent record. 6. A fee for Credit by Exam ination must be paid at the time of filing the petition. In a semester when the student is enrolled for fewer than 11 units, the fee may be waived. See here for a schedule of fees. Course Exemption by Examination It is possible for a student to be exempte d from a course by examination, with consent of the instructor. No course credit is earned; however, notice of the exemption is entered on the permanent record to certify that the student has fulfilled a general college requirement or a course prerequisite . Students who wish to be exempted from a Core course by examination must make arrangements with the Core Office prior to the semester in which the course is offered. The instructor has the privilege of recording a grade of Credit/No Credit rather than a l etter grade. A nominal fee is charged. Appropriate forms are available from the Registrar. Transfer Credit Transfer courses require prior approval by the department offering similar courses at Occidental College, and by the student's advisor. Transfer cour ses taken during the fall and spring semesters cannot be courses that are currently offered at Occidental and cannot be used to satisfy a Core requirement. Students desiring to take courses at another college while attending Oxy cannot exceed the maximum a llowable units per semester (normally 18, or 20 if the student's GPA is 3.0 or better) combined. Normally, no transfer courses will be allowed in the second semester of the student's senior year. A \"CURRENT STUDENT TRANSFER AND COURSE SUBSTITUTION FORM\" i s available in the Registrar's Office. A minimum grade of \"C\" or higher is required for transfer. The College will not accept transfer credit taken by examination from another institution. Courses taken in the fall and spring on non -approved Study Abroad p rograms will not be accepted. Transfer units from a semester system will be equal to the number of units taken at the institution where the courses were taken. Transfer units from a quarter system will be multiplied by .66 to convert to the semester system used at Occidental College. Students who participate in Off -Campus Study programs independently during a leave of absence from the College are ineligible for College financial aid or scholarships and no credit will be transferred toward the Occidental deg ree. Advanced Placement Credit and International Baccalaureate Course Credit Freshmen may be granted credit at the time of entrance for subjects in which they have completed College Entrance Examination Board Advanced Placement examinations with scores of 4 or 5 or International Baccalaureate scores of 6 or 7 in Higher Level (HL) courses only. This credit and resulting placement is subject to review by the appropriate departments. A student completing an approved Advanced Placement examination in most subje cts with a score of 4 or 5 will receive four units of credit toward the degree. These examinations may not be used to fulfill Core requirements. Not all Graduate and Professional programs accept AP credit of college courses. An applicant who has completed courses at an accredited college prior to graduation from high school also may request consideration for appropriate recognition of credit or placement. 29Credit earned either through Advanced Placement examinations, International Baccalaureate courses, or through college courses may make it possible for a student to enter advanced courses and also gain a wider opportunity for choice of electives in the undergraduate program. In general, each student will be expected to carry a normal load during the period o f attendance at Occidental. Summer Study at Other Institutions Work taken elsewhere during the summer may be accepted for credit toward a degree from Occidental, subject to advance approval from the chair of the department with which the course would be identified, the student's advisor, and the Registrar. It is also possible through petition to the Registrar to have summer study elsewhere accepted without credit to fulfill prerequisites or general college requirements. A minimum grade of \"C\" is required for transfer. Occidental will accept credits from a regionally ac ceredited college or university only. Classification of Students The class in which a student is to be ranked is determined as follows: Freshman: The meeting in full of all entrance requirements; Sophomore: The satisfactory completion of 32 units of credit; Junior: The satisfactory completion of 64 units of credit; Senior: The satisfactory completion of 96 units of credit. Writing Program Occidental expects its graduates to demonstrate superior writing ability. The Writing Program prepares students in all disc iplines to write effectively: to develop complex concepts clearly and fully, to organize essays and reports logically, and to maintain the conventions of standard written English. This standard of writing performance is upheld in all College courses. To ac hieve this goal, the College emphasizes expository writing and research skills in the Core curriculum, in courses emphasizing the methodologies of various disciplines, and in the composition courses in the English Writing Department. The foundation of the College's Writing Program is the first -year instructional program in Cultural Studies. First -year students take year- long, sequenced seminars that help students develop college -level writing strategies in rich disciplinary content to further their knowledg e and communication of the topics they study. In addition to the Core curriculum in writing, the Writing and Rhetoric Department offers courses to students who want to concentrate on the most effective strategies for writing in and out of the academy. Thes e include English Writing 201, a class that centers on the processes and skills necessary to fine writing, and the College's advanced writing courses, English Writing 301 and 401. Any student seeking individual instruction in writing or assistance with a p articular paper will find support and advice available at the Center for Academic Excellence (CAE), where English Writing professors work as writing specialists, and where student writing advisors collaborate with student writers. The Director of Writing P rograms will gladly advise students of all resources available for developing their writing ability. Proficiency in writing is a requirement for graduation. Students meet this requirement in two stages, the first of which is passing the first -stage Writing Proficiency evaluation in the Cultural Studies Program. Completion of the Cultural Studies courses does not by itself satisfy the writing requirement. An additional measure of writing proficiency is required; most recently this measure has been participat ion in a shared intellectual experience with required reading. Frosh are expected to pass the writing exercise that culminates the experience. Those who do not pass the Cultural Studies Writing evaluations will be asked to pass with a C or better a course in the Department of English Writing (201) or another writing course designated by the Director of Writing Programs in conjunction with the Director of the Core Program. The second stage of 30the requirement will be met in the student's major department. Eac h department at the College has specified its own writing requirement in the major; students should consult their department chair. FIRST STAGE WRITING REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS In order to fulfill the First Stage Writing Requirement, transfer stud ents must: 1) have completed two writing courses (minimum six semester units) with specific writing instruction (not simply a course offered in an English department, nor any literature, creative writing, \"writing intensive\" courses) prior to transferring to the College; any courses not approved by the Registrar upon entrance must be appealed through the Writing Program; or 2) complete English Writing 201 or 401 after entering the College; or 3) submit a petition and portfolio before the senior year. Studen ts must contact Writing Programs at the CAE to receive instructions. Each student should receive, at the time of declaring the major, a description of the particular Second Stage Writing Requirement for the department. However, an overview of the departmen t options follows: FIRST STAGE WRITING PORTFOLIO OPTION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Generally compiled over the sophomore and junior years, three papers are drawn from departmental work. Revisions are encouraged or may be required. One paper may be a retrospecti ve analysis of the student's writing. A reflective analysis of the portfolio may be required in addition to the three papers. Portfolios are read by more than one faculty member. The requirements for submitting a portfolio are available in the Writing Prog rams Office. The Writing Programs Department and the Director of the Core Program make every effort to work with an individual student's portfolio submissions. SECOND STAGE WRITING Writing-Intensive Seminars: Most departments require a single junior -year s eminar that includes a considerable amount of writing. The final product is read by more than one professor. A grade of B - is usually required, depending on the department. Fulfillment of the requirement is met through additional coursework when the grade in the seminar is not satisfactory. Writing Across the Major: Some departments have deemed all upper -division courses writing intensive. A few departments require more than one writing -intensive course in order to complete the Second Stage Writing Requirem ent in the major. An average grade of B - is generally required, depending on the department. See department chair for specifics. Creative Writing: It is recommended that students interested in creative writing choose a major or minor that will provide them background in literature. Of special interest is the Writing Emphasis in the English and Comparative Literary Studies department. The College believes that it is essential to understand a tradition of literature and authorship in order to become a writer oneself. There are also offerings in various creative arts at the College that would support such an emphasis. Students interested in journalistic writing should consider the importance of intellectual background and training available in the different pro grams in the humanities, arts, sciences, and social sciences. Students also have the opportunity to take independent studies in creative writing, and in special cases, to elect Senior Year Honors Projects in writing. Specific courses that address creative writing include English 380 (Creative Writing), English Writing 286 (Principles of Journalism II), English Writing 301 (Creative Non -Fiction), English Writing 401 (Writing Across the Curriculum), French 343 (Theory and Practice of Translation), Theater 201 (Alternative Voices in American Theater), and Theater 380 (Playwriting). Writers also are invited regularly to English creative writing classes and to the Intercultural Community Center, events that are open to the campus at large. 31Additionally, every oth er year a Remsen Bird Visiting Artist gives classes and/or workshops on campus. In the last few years the English Department has sponsored several literary Honors Projects in writing. Specific courses that address creative writing include English 380 (Crea tive Writing), English Writing 286 (Principles of Journalism II), English Writing 301 (Creative Non -Fiction), English Writing 401 (Writing Across the Curriculum), French 343 (Theory and Practice of Translation), Theater 201 (Alternative Voices in American Theater), and Theater 380 (Playwriting). Writers also are invited regularly to English creative writing classes and to the Intercultural Community Center, events that are open to the campus at large. Additionally, every other year a Remsen Bird Visiting Ar tist gives classes and/or workshops on campus. In the last few years the English Department has sponsored several literary conferences with invited guests; the department also sponsors a literary contest with prizes for fiction, poetry, and short drama, an d provides support for The Occidental Review, a literary magazine edited by students. Students also have the opportunity to work on the student newspaper, to join literary clubs, and to elect an internship course under the direction of a faculty member. In ternships, arranged with the help of the Career Development Center, have included work at the Mark Taper Forum, the Getty Art Institute, the Huntington Library, the Minority Training Institute, and Dreamworks. Students at Occidental also have the opportuni ty to hear distinguished writers on campus; guests in the last several years have included Alice Walker, bell hooks, Walter Mosley, Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol Oates, Sandra Cisneros, Amy Tan, Anna Deavere Smith, Maya Angelou, and Gish jen. The Los Angeles area offers opportunities to hear many other writers at Vroman Bookstore, Beyond Baroque, Skylight Books, and Dawson Books, among others. Advising Occidental students have two sources of general information and counsel about the curriculum: the Advising Center, which works closely with students during their first two years at Oxy, and a faculty advisor, assigned to each new student when they first arrive on campus. Faculty advisors act as an individual resource until the student declares a major (by the m iddle of the second semester of their sophomore year) and obtains a departmental advisor. Although its focus is on first - and second -year students, the Advising Center is available to all students on a five -day-per-week, year -round basis. The Advising Cent er helps students keep track of their Core requirements, offers general information about registration and concrete information about majors, minors, and College policies and procedures. The Advising Center also helps students connect with faculty members by making appointments and by identifying the appropriate faculty for specific questions. Faculty advisors help students understand their intended major and may also help them identify the appropriate campus resources for further help. As student interests change, faculty contacts can be changed by the student at any time. Students are encouraged and expected to seek faculty counsel regularly Other advising opportunities: National Awards - Fellowships and Scholarships . First year students are encouraged to meet with the assistant director of National awards for one -on-one advising session to explore opportunities available to them early in their academic career. The Office of Pre -Health Advising at Occidental College pr ovides information and in -depth advisement to students and alumni who are interested in matriculating to professional gradua te programs in health sciences. 32Special Programs International Programs International Programs endeavors to advance Occidental's str ategic goal \u2014to prepare \"citizens of the world\" skilled at negotiating its complexities, eclectic in their interests and tastes. Occidental recognizes the important role of international experience in a liberal arts and sciences education and as a key compo nent in preparing undergraduates for successful and satisfying participation in today's interdependent world. International students bring diversity of perspectives to our campus. Academic experience abroad challenges undergraduate scholars to think beyond the cultural constructs implicit in their disciplines and socialization. Through ongoing assessment of student learning outcomes, IPO documents how exchanges \u2014both on and off campus \u2014develop cross- cultural communication and analytic skills; a global perspec tive; and polished language proficiency, sharpened intellect, and broadened imagination. All study abroad during the academic year or over the summer must be approved by Occidental's International Programs Office, linked here . Generally, eligibility includes good academic and conduct standing and a 3.0 gpa. Programs may have additional eligibility or pre-requisites. Credits earned abroad during fall or spring semester are considered in-residence Occidental credits and therefore count in the GPA and honors calculations. Summer study abroad is transfer credit. College Financial Aid transfers to Fall and Spring semester study abroad, but not summer study abroad. Combined Plans in Libera l Arts and Engineering Combined Plans in Liberal Arts and Engineering Liaison and Advisor for Physical Sequence Professor Schramm (Physics) Advisor for Computer Science Sequence Professor Lengyel (Mathematics) Professor Craney (Chemistry) Occidental Colle ge cooperates with the California Institute of Technology and the School of Engineering of Columbia University in several programs of engineering education based on a broad foundation in the liberal arts. These combined plans provide qualified students wit h an excellent liberal arts background and advanced - level entrance into either of two outstanding engineering schools. The programs are designed specifically for superior students who have strong preparation in English writing skills, mathematics, and scie nce. The curriculum offers considerable freedom of choice of an eventual major. Students who, by the end of the first two years, find their interests developing in fields outside of science or technology, may still choose most nonscience majors in the College and graduate after the usual additional two years of course work. Similar options also exist through the junior year for choosing majors in mathematics or most other sciences without loss of time. Thus, in contrast to many engineerin g programs, students choosing the combined plans 33do not commit themselves in the first year exclusively to an engineering major. This flexibility is particularly advantageous to capable students whose abilities and interests span many fields. The 3/2 Combi ned Plan Program requires completion of three years of work in the liberal arts and sciences at Occidental followed by two years of regular session work at Caltech, or the School of Engineering of Columbia University. This leads to the degree of Bachelor o f Arts in the Combined Plan from Occidental and the degree of Bachelor of Science in the selected field of engineering from either Caltech or Columbia. Students interested in the 3/2 program gain entrance into the engineering school through a strong academ ic record at Occidental and a recommendation by the Occidental liaison officer on behalf of the faculty. At least a 3.5 grade point average, both in science/mathematics and overall, is required. Those seeking entrance to Caltech must also receive approval from the Caltech Office of Admission. Students entering the programs at Occidental should have received excellent grades in high school English (including writing experience), mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Four years of high school mathematics are required, including trigonometry and a course often called Introductory Analysis (or Pre -Calculus). Students wishing to enter these programs should apply directly to Occidental. Course Requirements for the Combined Plans The program of studies for the first three years consists of all of the required courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts as outlined. Unless otherwise exempted, students must begin Mathematics 110 or 114 and either Physics 106, Chemistry 120, or Chemistry 130 (depending on the sequ ence chosen) in the freshman year. All Occidental requirements must be met by spring semester of the junior year. MAJOR: Students must complete one or two years of physics, two years of mathematics, and one year of chemistry. The three sequences will requi re additional courses. See the sequence advisor for details. The Occidental comprehensive examination is waived for 3/2 Combined Plan students. Majors in the Combined Plans: The following is a partial list of the fields currently offered at one or both o f the engineering institutions. Physical Sequence Aeronautics Applied Geophysics Applied Mathematics (3/2 only) Applied Physics Biomechanics Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering Communications and Control Computer Engineering Design Engineering Electrical Engineering Electronic Circuits Engineering Mechanics Fluids Engineering and Jet Propulsion Industrial Engineering Nuclear Engineering Operations Research 34Quantum Electronics Solid State Electronics Chemical Sequence Applied Chemistry (4/2 only) Bioengineering Chemical Engineering Mineral Engineering Physical or Chemical Sequence Environmental Engineering Materials Science Metallurgical Engineering Mining Engineering Solid State Science (4/2 only) Computer Science Sequence Computer Science Operation s Research Industrial Engineering Exchange Program with the California Institute of Technology An exchange program between Occidental and Caltech permits full -time students at either school to receive credit for courses taken at the other institution dur ing the fall or spring semesters but not during the summer. The option does not apply to courses that are equivalent to those offered by the home institution, but is designed to enlarge the range of course offerings a student may take. Thus, Occidental stu dents may enroll in such courses as applied science, astronomy, or engineering. A student in the exchange program must obtain prior approval from his or her advisor, the instructor of the course, and the Occidental and Caltech registrars. The program is us ually not open to freshmen. Students must be full -time at Occidental (a minimum of 12 units). Additional tuition payments are not required, but the student may have to pay special fees in connection with certain laboratory courses. Occidental College will add the course on the current registration as a placeholder but will remove it upon completion of the course and add it as a transfer course. The Unit conversion from California Institute of Technology to Occidental College is as follows: Cal Tech units Occidental College Units 0 to 1 unit 0 unit 1 to 5 units 1 unit 6 to 8 Units 2 units 9 to 11 units 3 units 12 units to 15 units 4 units 16 units to 18 un its 5 units 19 units to 21 units 6 units At the completion of an exchange course, appropriate information is recorded on the student's Occidental transcript as transfer credit on the Occidental transcript. 35Exchange Program with the Art Cent er College of Design Full-time students at Occidental and Art Center may receive credit for courses taken at the other institution during the fall or spring semesters but not during the summer, with the permission of both institutions. The program is designed for art majors and is not open to first -year students. A student in this exchange program must obtain prior approval from the chair of the Department of Art History and the Visual Arts at Occidental, his or her advisor, the instructor of the cours e, and the Occidental and Art Center registrars. Students must be full -time at Occidental (a minimum of 12 units). Additional tuition payments are not required, but there may be special laboratory fees. Occidental College will add the course on the current registration as a placeholder but will remove it upon completion of the course and add it as a transfer course. At the completion of an exchange course, appropriate information is recorded on the student's Occidental transcript as transfer credit on the O ccidental transcript. Cooperative Arrangement: Columbia University School of Law The Columbia School of Law may admit Occidental students upon completion of their junior year to its Accelerated Interdisciplinary Program in Legal Education, leading to the p otential completion of the Bachelor of Arts degree from Occidental and Doctor of Jurisprudence from Columbia at the end of six years. The program is highly competitive in terms of both grade point average and LSAT scores. Contact the Career Development Cen ter for details. Cooperative Arrangement with the Keck Graduate Institute In collaboration with the Keck Graduate Institute, students interested in biotechnology may qualify for admission to the Master's in Bioscience Program. Students in the program will complete the four -year Bachelor of Arts degree in biochemistry at Occidental including specified courses for one of three tracks - computational biology, bioengineering, or biosystems - in preparation for study at KGI toward the Master's in Bioscience. Stu dents with at least a 3.2 GPA in their required biochemistry classes will be guaranteed admission to the KGI master's program immediately following their graduation. National Awards - Fellowships & Scholarships The Office of National Awards advises student s and alumni interested in pursuing national scholarships and fellowship opportunities. We inform, recruit, counsel and prepare Occidental College candidates in their pursuit of highly competitive and prestigious academic opportunities. First year studen ts are encourage to meet with the Assistant Director of National Awards for one -on-one advising sessions to explore opportunities available to them early in their academic career. Students and alumni applying for these awards should demonstrate: stron g academic achievement outstanding leadership roles involvement in their civic engagement participation in research participation in internships alignment with specific eligibility criteria for individual awards 36 The office works collaboratively with faculty advisors, faculty mentors and the Faculty National Awards Committee to introduce students and alumni to a range of national and international opportunities including: fellowships, scholarships, post -graduate study, internships, and research positio ns at highly esteemed institutions. We offer workshops on writing a personal statement and a research proposal. Information meetings are held on individual awards to inform students and alumni of the awards opportunities available to them. We work in pa rtnership with other campus departments, the Center for Academic Excellence Writing Specialists, the Career Development Center, the Undergraduate Research Office, International Programs and the Office of Civic Engagement to assist the Occidental College ca ndidates in submitting their most compelling and competitive application.

Appropriate academic credit, not to exceed eight units, may be awarded upon successful completion of transfer work in these programs. Interested applicants should consult the Office of Admission or the Associate Registrar for details. Veterans Benefits There is considerable financial aid available to vete rans and their families through the GI Bill, War Orphans Educational Law, and other programs. Widows and children of deceased veterans as well as spouses and children of totally disabled veterans are eligible for educational benefits. Further information c an be secured from the local Veterans Administration Office. Students eligible to receive veterans benefits should contact the Registrar's Office to certify enrollment to the Veterans Administration. Those expecting government checks are reminded that this aid may not be available for two to three months at the beginning of the fall semester. All students receiving benefits through the VA are required to maintain 12 units per semester to receive the maximum monthly benefit. Disability Services 37Occidental College works to support students who are differently abled so that they have equal access to programs, activities, jobs, services, and courses. Students who need help related to their disability are encouraged to contact Disability Services by calling 323 -259-2969 or emailing accessibility@oxy.edu . This office offers services such as approval for accommodations, assistance with advocacy, ensuring adherence to state and federal disability laws, and basic support for academic skill building. By working closely with faculty, staff, and administrators, the Disability Services team works to create a supportive community that promotes awareness, sensitivity and understanding of students with disabilities. Summer Opti on While Occidental does not have a formal summer program, current Oxy students engage in independent study, research programs, and internships during the summer. The College also offers its distinctive Multicultural Summer Institute for select first -year students. 38American Studies American Studies is an interdisciplinary exploration - with an emphasis on history and literature--of the voices and visions that interpret and in turn shape the American experience.The search for a distinctive American culture has a long-standing tradition. How thatexperience is represented is influenced by the changing dynamics of domestic affairs and thegeopolitics of United States foreign policy. The study of what it means to be \"American\" both athome and abroad is to understand the often conflicting voices and visions of Americans overtime. Therefore, we encourage our majors to apply for international and domestic off-campusstudy. The field is concerned with questions such as whether or not there is a national culture. Can we, for example, reconcile the tension between traditional narratives of individualism and self-reliance, and the counter-narratives of community and oppression? This discussion isparticularly appropriate as we enter a new century of challenges in a post-Cold War world. Thestrengths of our department include courses offering multiple perspectives on Americanhistory, literature, culture, art, and politics. Requirements MAJOR: The American Studies major consists of a minimum of 10 courses (40 units) to include History 101 or 102 (or their equivalent), ECLS 189 or 289 (or their equivalent),Psychology 110 or 333 and 333L, and AMST 290, 390, and 490, and five other coursesselected in consultation with an advisor from the American Studies faculty. Three of the fivecourses are required to be in American Studies. They include AMST 240, 242, 270, 272, 280,and 295.

WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in American Studies will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing American Studies 290 and 390 (or their equivalent) with a grade of B- or higher.Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time ofdeclaring the major. See the college writing requirement and consult the department chair foradditional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Completion of a paper and a presentation on a topic in the student's area of emphasis as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the senior seminar (AMST 490). Research proposals for the senior project are due October 1 of the senior year. 39HONORS: Students meeting college requirements for honors may apply for admission to the program by submitting a written proposal for an honors thesis by October 1 of their senior year. Those accepted may register for American Studies 499 during the fall or spring semester of thesenior year; the thesis should be completed by the end of the senior year. In general it isexpected that honors students will also take American Studies 490. For further information seethe Honors Program and the department chair.

To begin with, what makes a particular building -- house, office block, or skyscraper -- green? Second, and morefundamentally, how has our understanding of the relationship between architecture and natureshifted over the centuries? The course will begin by looking at a range of depictions of thatrelationship in art, architecture, literature, and philosophy before moving on to examinearchitecture's role in the nascent environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s. It willconsider the rise and increasing codification of green architecture in the last 15 years in theU.S. and Europe, isolating certain buildings as case studies and assessing in some depthrecent debates over the American green-design rating system known as LEED. Finally, we'llask what green architects might learn from the ways that other sustainability movements -- intransportation, product design, clean-energy, and food policy -- have matured over the years.Students will visit a number of built examples of green architecture in and around Los Angeles.No prior study of architectural history is required.2 units H362 - Art in Early China H362.

Within an evolutionary framework, our program investigates the interactions between molecules, cells,organisms, populations, and ecosystems that constitute life on earth. Interdisciplinary andintegrative by nature, the biology program at Occidental engages both majors and non-majorsin a curriculum that emphasizes laboratory and field investigations. Our students areencouraged to collaborate with faculty mentors, whose research employs current methods inaddressing questions from the molecular to the global in scale. Students acquire skills fromcareful observation through hypothesis formulation and experimental design to formal oral andwritten presentations of results. After participating in the biology program at Occidental,students are prepared for rewarding work and lifelong learning, armed with the tools necessaryto understand large complex data sets and help explain the intricacies of living systems. Thisrigorous program provides our students with the training to enter the work force aftergraduation and/or transition to an advanced degree program. After completing the major,many students elect to take graduate training toward the Ph.D. in biological sciences ordoctorates of medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacy or dentistry. Many of our studentscomplete Masters programs in Biological Sciences, teaching, environmental health and safety,and resource management. Receiving a degree in Biology at Occidental College enables ourstudents to excel in any post-baccalaureate professional pursuit. The Department of Biology is housed within the Bioscience building which is contiguous with the Moore Laboratory of Zoology. Facilities include the bird and mammal collections (70,000specimens) of Moore Laboratory, greenhouses, facilities for microscopy (scanning andtransmission electron and fluorescence), a tissue culture suite and fluorescence-activated cellsorter, fully-equipped molecular biology laboratories, field vehicles, and three research vesselsfor nearshore marine studies and SCUBA diving. Because of its proximity to the MojaveDesert, the Santa Monica, San Gabriel, and San Bernardino Mountains, and seacoast,Occidental College is ideally suited for field and laboratory studies of environmental biology.

UC Davis; M.A., Ph.D., UC Santa Mathematics B.S., UCLA; Ph.D., Caltech 115Core Program The Core Program is a cross-disciplinary array of courses required of all students. providing the intellectual foundation for Occidental's commitment to excellence, equity, service, andcommunity. Core classes ask students to engage in analytic and creative thinking: posingquestions from different points of view, solving problems, formulating hypotheses, gatheringevidence to support claims and arguments, drawing appropriate conclusions, and expressingideas clearly. These classes explore the large questions which we believe all students mustaddress in order to participate fully in their academic careers, their vocations, and their lives:questions of human cultures and beliefs, of creativity, and of the physical world. Students areasked to examine previously held ideas in the context of new and challenging ones, toexperiment imaginatively, to articulate similarities and differences, and to revise both ideas andwritten work. Methods and materials vary, in disciplines ranging from the humanities to thesocial sciences, to science, mathematics, and art; and analytic thinking may take place in thecontext of a lab, in the close reading of a text, on a stage, in a lecture hall, on a computerscreen, in a screening room, or in the field. Assignments will also vary from papers, to arguinga thesis, to problem sets, to research term papers, to lab reports, to paintings. The first-year Cultural Studies Program Seminars are the centerpiece of the Core Program. These are small seminars, each designed by a faculty member around a topic in his or herfield of expertise, emphasizing discussion, critical analysis, and intensive instruction in writing.Students take one seminar in the fall and one in the spring, for a total of 8 units. In the fallseminars, faculty and students jointly explore human culture from a variety of disciplinary aswell as cultural perspectives. Spring seminars approach topics from a global perspective andstress the writing of scholarly research-based essays, Successful performance in CulturalStudies Seminars, along with a satisfactory writing evaluation, satisfies the college's first-stagewriting requirement (see the College writing requirement ) and is equivalent to two semesters of English composition. The Seminars for the coming year are described below. Students maynot drop a Cultural Studies Program Seminar. In addition, students participate in the study of culture as embodied in the arts and sciences as well as in the humanities and social sciences. We require a minimum of three courses (12units) taken in academic departments that provide significant experiences in (a) diversity in theUnited States, (b) global connections between cultures, regions, and nations, and (c) a regionof the world other than the United States. One of these (or an additional course) must focus ona period prior to 1800, and one (or an additional course) must treat the theory or practice of thefine arts. Individual courses can meet a maximum of two Core requirements. Lifelong learning requires a basic understanding of the theory and methods of the sciences. Accordingly, students are required to take a total of three courses (12 units) in the sciencesand mathematics. Of the three, at least one must be a laboratory science. Finally, graduates of the College must demonstrate proficiency in a language other than English. The various ways of satisfying this requirement are detailed in the requirements forUndergraduate Study. Requirements 1161) Culture and Fine Arts: A minimum of 12 units (16 or 20 units are recommended) continue and expand on the first- year CSP seminars by situating the study of culture and the arts in specific disciplinary andgeographical contexts. Students must enroll in a minimum of four units in each of threedifferent categories. Four units must represent study of historical periods prior to 1800, andfour must be devoted to the fine arts. The pre-1800 and fine arts requirements may be met incourses also representing one of the three major categories of culture requirements, althoughno course may satisfy more than two requirements. Advanced Placement or InternationalBaccalaureate examinations may not be used to satisfy any of these requirements. Students who matriculated at Occidental prior to fall 2013 must meet 12 units of the culture requirement as follows: One four-unit course must be chosen from each of any three of the following six cultural/geographical categories:Africa and the Middle East (CPAF) Central, South, and East Asia (CPAS)Europe (CPEU)Latin America (CPLA)U.S. Culture (CPUS)Intercultural (CPIC) Some of these courses are also designated Pre-1800 (CPPE) or Fine Arts (CPFA). Students who matriculated at Occidental in fall 2013 or later must meet 12 units of the culture requirement as follows: One four-unit course must be chosen from each of the following three categories: Global Connections (CPGC) Regional Focus (CPRF)U.S. Diversity (CPUD) Some of these courses are also designated Pre-1800 (CPPE) or Fine Arts (CPFA). Courses will be listed in the Catalog and online Course Counts with both pre- and post-2013 designation. 2) Science/Mathematics Requirement . A minimum of 12 units in science and mathematics. Four units must be in a science course with a laboratory component. The remaining 8 units may be taken from among any of the courses that satisfy the Science/Mathematicsrequirement. Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations may not beused to satisfy any of these requirements. 3) Foreign Language: 0-8 Units. All students must achieve Language 102-level proficiency in a language other than English. Students may not take Language 101 for credit if they have 117taken more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school (grades 10-12) Placement: Students may begin study of a new language at the 101 level if they have not taken it previously for more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school(grades 10-12). They are not required to take the College's placement exam. First-yearstudents may take the Occidental College Placement Exam either on-line for French, German,and Spanish, or during orientation for other languages taught at Occidental if: a. they have taken more than one quarter in college or more than one year in high school (grades 10-12)b. they have participated in after-school or weekend language programs; orc. they have extensive background in but no formal training in a language. Students can fulfill Occidental's language requirement in one of five ways: 1. by completing a language course numbered 102 at Occidental, or the equivalent course in any foreign language at another accredited institution. 2. by receiving an exemption-level score on Occidental's placement and/or exemption exam given during orientation. (see language studio website for language specific details). 3. by earning an appropriate Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) II score (560 or above on French, Spanish, or Latin; 550 or above on German or Chinese; 540 or above on Japanese; or 560 for other languages): 4. by earning an Advanced Placement test score of 4 or above or.5. for some languages not taught at Occidental, students may by taking the ACTFL oral proficiency interview (OPI) and the writing proficiency test (WPT) in the languagescurrently available. Please see the Keck Language and Culture Studio aboutdemonstrating proficiency via ACTFL. Foreign Language Exemption Policy International students whose language of education has been in a language other than English and who have completed six years of elementary education or more in a foreign language areexempt from the foreign language requirement. Such students should contact the chair of oneof the foreign language departments to confirm their fulfillment of the foreign languagerequirement. CORE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: Transfer students may meet the Core requirements through classes taken before matriculation at Occidental, or through classes taken at Occidental, or (as is the case for most transferstudents) through a combination of both. Transfer students must take the equivalent of twoCultural Studies Seminar (8 units or 2 classes), a minimum of 12 additional units or 3 classesin distribution courses in culture (including pre-1800) and the fine arts, as described above,and 12 units or 3 classes in science and/or mathematics, including a designated lab sciencecourse. They must also complete the language requirement. Appropriate equivalents aredetermined in consultation with the Core Program Office and the Registrar. Cultural Studies Seminar (4 units). A conventional English composition class, or a course specified as \"writing-intensive,\" will ordinarily satisfy this requirement. Any four-unit course in Occidental's Department of English Writing will meet the seminar requirement. The first stageof the writing requirement is a different requirement, and is explained under the Writing 118Program. Culture and Fine Arts Distribution Courses (Minimum 12 units or 3 full classes, 16 or 20\u20144 or 5 full classes\u2014recommended). Transfer students must take a minimum of 4 units or one fullclass from each of three groups listed above (U.S. Diversity, Global Connections, and RegionalFocus), and must take 4 units or one full class in courses designated \"pre-1800\" and 4 units orone full class in courses designated as \"fine arts.\" The pre-1800 and fine arts requirementsmay be met in courses also representing one of the three major categories of culturerequirements, although no course may satisfy more than two requirements. Mathematics and Science (12 units or 3 full classes). Most transfer students have met at least some of these upon entry. Of these, at least one class must include a laboratory or field component. All of these Core requirements should be completed by the end of the junior year. Courses Cultural Studies Program Fall Writing Seminars Fall 2014 Course CSP 1 is designated a CSP \"Lab\" course, team-taught experimental seminar designed to engage their students critically and actively in synthesizing knowledge and ideas about animportant topic. In this class you'll work closely with faculty from more than one academicfield, developing new, cross-disciplinary perspectives; you'll engage in intensive reading,writing, and discussion; you'll participate in field experiences beyond the classroom; you'lllearn to think and work collaboratively, as a member of a diverse intellectual community. CSP 1. THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT SEMESTER. 16 units: counts as four academic courses (CSP1, Biology 110, Economics 101, and Geology 105). Satisfies fall CSP requirement and Core Lab and Non-lab Sciencerequirements. (NOTE: This course will fill 16 of your allowed 18 available units for fall). Join a group of first-year students and three faculty learning about natural science, economics, and the environment of California. The spectacular California landscape will be our laboratoryas we investigate the geology, biology and economics of our environment through datacollection, laboratory and computer analysis, critical thinking and writing, and classroomlearning. Multi-day field trips during the school week introduce you to your fellow CESclassmates while hiking and camping in State and National Parks throughout California. Noprior camping experience is expected, and we'll provide camping gear. All of your courseworkin fall semester will be taken with your CES peers. The California Environmental Semester is a great way to begin your college career. In addition to satisfying three Core requirements, its classes may count toward seven different programs 119of study: Biology, Economics, Environmental Science, Geology, Politics, Diplomacy and World Affairs (DWA), and Urban and Environmental Policy (UEP). Beyond these programs, CESstudents excel in a wide variety of majors and college activities from the theater stage to theplaying fields to student government, click here . CSP 4-unit Seminars CSP 2-31 are independent 4-unit Seminars. In these classes you'll join a small group of first-year students and a faculty member investigating a topic in his or her area ofinterest and scholarly expertise. Despite their broadly disparate subject matters, allseminars emphasize developing sophisticated reading, writing, and discussion skills;they also seek to encourage critical thinking, the informed questioning and analysis ofwhy we think and believe as we do. CSP 2 FREEDOM AND ITS FICTIONS: VIOLENCE AND ECSTASY IN THE GREEK POLIS. From the foul-mouthed hilarity of its comedies, to the inspiring athletic achievements of its Olympics; from the heart-wrenching sadness of its tragedies, to the shocking profundity of itshistoric and philosophic thinking, every one of the cultural and political institutions invented inthe Ancient Greek city-state find their common ground in that strange and complex experiencecalled \"freedom.\" Of course, to a large extent these are the same institutions which we livewithin to this very day. In this course, we will examine the concept of freedom in the Greek polis and beyond, through a careful study of the cultural contexts in which the term emerges: literature, religion andathletics; history, architecture, music and philosophy. To assist us in coming to terms with theAncient Greek experience of freedom, we will make constant reference to the notion as itappears in other cultures across the world, and will draw extensively upon the insights of anumber of modern (and \"postmodern\") philosophic and artistic movements (the existential,deconstructive, and phenomenological, to name but a few).Whenever possible, we will link ourstudy of the ancient world with the modern in order to encompass a broader range of humanexperiences. CSP 3 REPRESENTING L.A.: IMAGINED SPACES, LIVING PLACES. As a major U.S. city that grew in importance during a time of increasing globalization, Los Angeles occupies a unique position within the cultural imagination. This course will explorehow the unique geographical and cultural space of Los Angeles has contributed to ways inwhich the city has been imagined and represented in literature and film. In our explorations, wewill consider how L.A.'s roots, migrating populations, shifting community boundaries, andmultiple forms of power shape imaginings and lived realities of the city. How do variousrepresentations reflect - and diverge from - living communities within Los Angeles? How arethe city and its communities shaped by national and global forces? How has Los Angeles as adestination city for migrants shaped the ways it is imagined? How do we reconcile the duelingrepresentations of L.A. as both utopia and dystopia? Over the course of the semester, we willexamine a broad range of film and literature that will guide our discussion of these and otherquestions, interrogating what it means to live in the city of Los Angeles. CSP 4 SCIENCE AND YOU. Who should you believe: the sculpted Adonis who attributes his heavenly body solely to Product A, or your middle-aged doctor as he looks over horn-rimmed glasses and preaches toyou his mantra of fruits and vegetables? This course will explore how science is portrayed to 120the public, with the aim of deconstructing issues to objectively evaluate the merits of the arguments. The first part of the course will explore in great depth the perpetual, self-correctiveprocess of the scientific method to demonstrate the necessity of research and contradictoryviewpoints. The focus will then shift towards topics that include, among others, health/fitness,biotech, and the environment. Be prepared: This course includes a rigorous writing component, requires intensive group work both within the classroom (e.g., presentations) and beyond (e.g., community engagement),and emphasizes development of oral presentation skills. Students enrolling in this course must have a solid background in high school chemistryand biology. CSP 5 GENDER AND POP CULTURE. From Beyonc\u00e9 to David Beckham, from Girls to Mad Men, contemporary popular culture helps shape our understanding of what it is to be a woman or a man in the twenty-first century. Thiscourse will examine how gender is represented, constructed, and contested through popculture. We will begin with some key readings on the social construction of gender and itsintersections with other markers of difference, such as sexuality, race, and class. From thatfoundation, we will explore depictions of gender in recent literature, television, film, blogs,advertising, and music, using our own expertise as consumers of pop culture to question howthese forms both reinforce and challenge existing gender norms and why they are soinstrumental in shaping our understanding of gender. CSP 6 \"IN THE PROCESS OF SHATTERING THEIR CHAINS\": MODERN LITERATURES OF RESISTANCE IN THE U.S. AND MIDDLE EAST. The title of this course comes from Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961) in a hopeful overture for the decolonizing world. He says, \"The peoples of the Third World are inthe process of shattering their chains, and what is extraordinary is that they succeed\" (34).During Fanon's lifetime, there may have been some positive results from decolonization, butwas liberation achieved? Fanon also focuses on the fact that \"decolonization is truly thecreation of new men\" (2), but what does all of this mean? Who was the \"new man\"? the \"newwoman\"? What does emancipation signify to this emerging agent? What happened andhappens in the process of global decolonization? Using Fanon's concepts as the theoreticalbasis of our class, we will examine the representation of the emerging \"new man\" in novelsand short stories by Native American, African American, Chican@, and Asian American writersas well as in works from Palestine, Egypt, and Iran. We will begin in the mid-twentieth centuryand work through the present day to understand how literatures of resistance have offeredchallenges and critiques to the notion of emancipation and to Fanon's concept of the \"newman\" while expanding upon and complicating his idea. CSP 7 VISUAL STORYTELLING AND NARRATIVE FILM. Through readings, review of films from a variety of genres, hands-on visual projects, writing exercises, and class presentations this course will explore, examine and analyze the complexrelationships between Production Design (Settings and Costumes),Lighting, Composition and Editing that create the images of narrative film. Our framework willbe the investigation of the basic principles of visual storytelling and the development of a set ofevaluative criteria with which to critique the form, content and style of films from various erasand genres\u2014mystery, comedy, epic, and musical. The goal of the course is for the student to 121develop a greater understanding of how visual storytelling functions as well as an awareness of the applications and implications of these principles beyond cinema. The focus of the coursewill be developing the student's critical eye, exploring the practice of visual storytelling andfostering improvement of writing skills. CSP 8 HUMAN RIGHTS IN LATIN AMERICA IN LITERATURE AND FILM. Until not long ago, Latin America was best known for its economic, social and political turbulence. With most of the region in the hands of authoritarian governments, human rightsviolations were widespread and ranged from a lack of free elections to \"disappearances\" andstate-sponsored genocidal violence. Today the region is, to varying degrees, almost alldemocratic, but problems such as drug-related violence, poverty, and arbitrary criminal justicesystems still take a toll on individual rights. Yet the region should not just be known for itsproblems. Argentina's post-dictatorship experience has become a model in transitional justicestudied around the world, Mexico has adopted important changes in its criminal trialprocedures, and Brazil has challenged its long-standing complacency about the integration ofits African-heritage population by implementing an interesting blend of affirmative actionpolicies. Largely relying on novels, short stories, essays and films, \"Human Rights in LatinAmerica in Literature and Film\" will explore human rights-related problems and progress inLatin America over the last 60 years. CSP 9 THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. Americans are simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by prisons, prisoners, and prison life. A consistent reminder of this fascination is the proliferation of an array of reality TV programsexposing life behind prison walls and the popularity of fictional programs and movies aboutprison life. This course transcends the voyeuristic obsession with prisons and takes ameaningful look at the reality of imprisonment. My personal contact with prisons and prisonersduring my years as a public defender and prisoners' rights advocate has taught me that theprison population exists outside of the democratic sphere. This experience has afforded me adeeper appreciation and understanding of core democratic principles of freedom, civil liberties,human rights and equal protection and has energized me to advocate for those principles onbehalf of disenfranchised individuals and communities. I believe that students who studyincarceration will develop a greater appreciation and understanding of broad democraticprinciples. CSP 10. REACTING TO THE PAST. In \"Reacting to the Past,\" students participate in role-playing games that enable them to relive important intellectual debates in three separate historical moments. In \"Threshold ofDemocracy: Athens in 403 B.C.,\" students draw on Plato's Republic as well as excerpts fromThucydides, Xenophon, and other contemporary sources to debate the prospects for Atheniandemocracy in the wake of the Peloponnesian War. In \"Rousseau, Burke, and Revolution inFrance,\" students enter the intellectual and political currents that surged through revolutionaryParis in 1791. And in \"Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence, 1945,\" studentsparticipate in the struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building, perhaps the mostintractable and important issue of the modern world. CSP 11 CALIFORNIA STORIES: DIASPORA, (IM)MIGRATION, AND ALIENATION. The literature of California is as diverse as the body of individuals who populate this expansive state today. This course will take that diversity as its guide, exploring fictional representationsof Californian spaces and cultures by female and male writers from the African American,Asian American, Chicana/o, and Italian American literary traditions. We will pay special 122attention to how these novelists - from John Fante and Chester Himes to Helena Mar\u00eda Viramontes and Amy Tan - address issues of diaspora, immigration, migration, and socialalienation. How does Californian literature depict the lives and identities of contemporaryChinese or Mexican immigrants with enduring cultural and personal ties to home? How doesmembership in a diasporic community influence the experience of Depression-era Los Angelesfor African American and Italian American characters? What can we learn from novels thatconfront the physical suffering and social injustice facing California's migrant workers? CSP 12 REVOLUTIONS. Tunisia, Egypt and Libya in 2011, South Africa 1993, Zimbabwe in 1979- these are some of the African revolutions you will explore in this class. Delve into the revolutionary thought ofMarx, Lenin, Gandhi, Fanon, Biko and others. Engage in an intellectual journey into the socialand political movements that changed Africa. From anti-colonial to anti-authoritarian/military/Apartheid revolutions, African opposition leaders throughout the continenthave employed complex revolutionary strategies to bring about political change. The recentrevolutions in North Africa represent a continuation of a robust, volatile and contested tradition,highlighting the struggles of Africans in an increasingly globalized world, where corporateinterests and international actors play a strong and intrusive role. The implications of globaland digital media add new dimensions to notions of revolutionary mobilization and change.This class attempts to introduce you to the main concepts of revolutionary thought andrevolutionary action. CSP13 THE AMERICAN DREAM: AN INTERCULTURAL PERSPECTIVE. An intercultural examination of various conceptions of the American Dream from the colonial encounter to the contemporary period. We will examine authors ranging from John Winthrop,Benjamin Franklin, Henry David Thoreau, and Emily Dickinson to Toni Morrison, Maxine HongKingston, and Sandra Cisneros. CSP 14 POET, POEM, WORLD. This seminar will explore poetry and its purposes and effects. What are poems for? What do they do? How do they mediate between private and public realms, between poets and theirreaders, between the self and its world? Students will be encouraged to develop theoreticalresponses to questions like these, and to become familiar with the responses of other writersand thinkers who have addressed them. But the main focus of the course will be onexperiencing poems, discussing them, and writing analytically and clearly about them. CSP 15 THE ARTIST'S LIFE. Many students know the typical novel focuses on a single character's life journey\u2014what literary scholars call the \"bildungsroman.\" In this class we will examine an understudiedsubgenre\u2014the k\u00fcnstlerroman or \"life of the artist.\" We will consider key features of thisnarrative form and how it alters across literary, film, visual art and musical genres. By framingfugitive slave narratives as \"escape artists\"; by exploring visual artists like Jean-MichelBasquiat and Kara Walker; by watching Black Swan starring Natalie Portman and SpikeLee's Bamboozled, we will understand the complexity of taking up the artist's journey in themodern world and how this path becomes a metaphor for past and present social struggles. CSP 16 THE BERLIN WALL AND ITS FALL IN 1989. POLITICAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF A METROPOLIS. Berlin has been a focal point of German, European, and indeed world politics for more than a century. The course will focus 1) on the post WWII years, when Berlin became a divided city, a 123fault line in the Cold War, and the wall was a symbol of the irreconcilable differences between East and West, known throughout the world, 2) its unpredicted fall thanks to a powerful grassroots civil rights movement whose motives and expectations will be analyzed, and 3) theaftermath of the re-unification with its consequences, problems, and achievements throughoutGermany. The goal is to compare rhetoric and reality of the Cold War, the achievements andshortcomings of the GDR civil rights movement, the expectations of East and West (afterunification), the politics of memory, the role of various urban communities, and the changingcharacter of the city. A major component of the course will be the collaboration withthe Wendemuseum in Culver City which houses tens of thousands of documents and otheritems around the wall, its fall, the Wende or \"turning point,\" and everything relating to the GDRworld. We will also work closely together with the Villa Aurora - a German cultural institution inPacific Palisades - which invites young writers, film makers, and artists many of whom comefrom Berlin. CSP 17 ENVIRONMENT AND POWER IN CA HISTORY. This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the intellectual, social and political history of the California environment with a particular focus on the ways in which different cultural and ethnicgroups have perceived, used, managed, and conserved it over the past 250 years. The coursewill introduce students to essential concepts, concerns and methods in environmental history,at large, while engaging topics specific to California history including the Spanish frontier, theGold Rush, forestry, the hydraulic empire, wilderness parks, industrialization, urbanization, andenvironmental justice. Los Angeles as a field of study will occupy a significant place in ourexploration. CSP 18 SLAVERY AND EMANCIPATION IN FILM AND HISTORY. As evidenced by the awarding of the 2014 best picture Oscar to Twelve Years a Slave, the historical subject of slavery is receiving unprecedented national attention in popular featurefilms. This course will analyze the representation of slavery and emancipation in film. We willview several important works such as Sankofa, Beloved, Amistad, and Burn!, analyzing themin the light of published slave narratives, primary historical documents, historical scholarshipand film criticism. Participants in the class will think and write about how film depicts thehistorical experience of slavery and we will analyze underlying issues of race, gender,violence, and struggles for freedom. The course begins with film and readings centered in USsouthern slave society and culminates with the depiction of modern day slavery in the MendeNazer book Slave and film I Am Slave. In addition to regular class sessions taught byOccidental History Professor Sharla Fett, this course will also feature a series of guest visits byUCLA faculty member Dr. Brenda Stevenson. CSP 19 A GLOBAL HISTORY OF ANARCHISM. Description: This course looks at world history from the late 19th century into the 20th century by following the development of the global anarchist movement. We will look at cases fromFrance, Russia, Spain, Latin America, China, Japan, the Philippines, India, and the US throughprimary and secondary source readings as well as film. These diverse anarchist movementswere connected by global flows of migrants, ideas, and practices, and shaped by a newimagination of the world in response to imperialism and capitalism. We will end the course bylooking at the revival of anarchism from the 1960s to the present. CSP 20 SPORT IN FILM. From The Freshmen (1925) to Rocky (1976) to Bull Durham (1988) to Remember the Titans (2000) to Blue Crush (2002) to Bend It Like Beckham (2002) to The Fighter (2010) sport has 124been a central theme in film for close to a century. This course will explore such topics as race and class, gender, sexual orientation as depicted in sport film. Students will explore additionaltopics including motivation, personality, friendship, competition and group dynamics throughfilm (an additional 2hrs is spent per week viewing films). CSP 21 IN SEARCH OF AFRICANISMS IN THE MUSICS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. This course surveys African musical elements as they exist in North, South and Central America as well as in the Caribbean Islands. Through readings, lectures, videos and soundrecordings, we will trace the historical origins of some traditional aspects found in Africa andrelate them to the development of many musical genres found in the Western Hemisphere. CSP 22 LESSONS FROM THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS. We will begin by reading selections from the ethical writings of three great philosophers: Aristotle (4th century BCE), Immanuel Kant (18th century), and John Stuart Mill (19th century). We will then use the insights and arguments of the great philosophers to determine what thenature of a meaningful life is -- what we ought to value and how we ought to live. We willconsider what kinds of moral obligations we have, not only to ourselves, our families, and ourfriends, but also to strangers, to non-human animals, and to nature. CSP 23 CONFRONTING AUTHORITY: REFLECTIONS ON PROTEST AND NARRATIVE STORYTELLING. Adapted from the title of Derrick Bell's influential work Confronting Authority: Reflections of an Ardent Protester this course will explore narrative storytelling in its many forms. Whilethis course will draw on examples of narrative storytelling against subordination or social(in)justices in broader contexts, it will also interact significantly with examples of storytelling indaily life reflecting a desire to a have a meaningful, rather than tokenized, voice. In thiscourse, we will use interdisciplinary readings, films, music, experiential learning, and casestudies. Students will work closely with faculty and peers to plan and facilitate classsessions. Students will also be required to attend events outside of the course meeting time. CSP 24 L.A. TRANSITIONS: RACE, SPACE, AND PLACE IN THE CITY OF ANGELES. Complex and contradictory, Los Angeles defies simple understandings. Through the lens of neighborhood transitions this course will examine the economic, political, and social forces thatshape this city. Relying upon insights from a variety of disciplinary perspectives includingcritical theory, ethnic studies, geography, history, political science, sociology and urbanplanning we will examine how LA's neighborhoods have been created, contested, andrecreated over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Our texts will include maps,photography, literature, film, music, and others. This course will be supplemented bycommunity-based learning exercises that may include field trips and off-campus assignments. CSP 25 POPULARS, JOCKS AND NERDS: PEER RELATIONS IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE. The course is designed to examine current scientific research on peer relationships in childhood and adolescence. The questions which will guide the course include: What types ofchildren are victimized by their peers? Why are some children more popular than others?What effect does popularity have on children and adolescents' emotional, behavioral, oracademic functioning? What role does aggression play in establishing and maintaining statusin the peer group? What types of peer crowds do adolescents affiliate with? How are peerrelationships different as individuals develop? We will discuss how psychological science has 125been used to examine these, and related questions about child and adolescent peer relationships. The course will examine the form and function of peer relationships in Westernand non-Western cultures. CSP 26 NATURE WRITING AND THE ENVIRONMENT. This course examines classic and contemporary texts categorized as nature writing. We will explore three themes in close readings of these texts: 1) nature writing as literary genre, 2)nature writing as development of spiritual consciousness, and 3) nature writing as expressionof ecological/environmental concern. Focusing on North America, we will give special attentionto California and the West, as we review the connection between nature writing and emergentenvironmental ethics in a time of environmental crisis. This writing seminar will draw from theskill and power of nature writing to advance our own efforts at effective writing. CSP 27 BONDAGE, FREEDOM, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL: RHETORICS AND REALITIES. This class will examine forms of bondage and freedom in U.S. culture and society, as we take a comparative look at the meanings of emancipation and the politics of liberation. Through ourwork with a range of materials, especially literature and film, we will consider the rhetoricaluses of the ideas of freedom: how have memories of emancipation and enslavement beensustained, suppressed, and constructed? What are the features of race, class, and genderoppression (and what features do they share), and what is the place of violence and anarchismin political action against oppressive forces? How are earlier debates about liberation stillrelevant and resonant today? We will look at how these debates are represented culturally atkey historical moments, from the Civil War through the McCarthy era, women's suffrage towomen's liberation, in texts as seemingly different, for example, as Griffith's Birth of a Nationand Tarantino's Django Unchained or in futuristic-dystopian depictions of human bondage inthe Planet of the Apes (1968) or The Handmaid's Tale. CSP28 ISLANDS OF INFLUENCE. In this course, we seek to compare indigenous and Western imaginings of modernity and globalization within the context of island nations. Modern and contemporary art objects, film,and music will anchor the ways in which island societies may be distinctly conceptualizedwithin discourses of identity, tourism, and diaspora. Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic,Cuba, Haiti, Hawaii, Samoa, and New Zealand will form the field of exploration as we discuss(1) how cultural, ethnic and national identities are formed, (2) the relationship between visualculture and the construction of historical and cultural narratives, and (3) the ways in whichtradition, culture, and identity shape (and are shaped by) visual practices. CSP29 COMING OF AGE IN A BORDERLESS(?) WORLD. In our current moment, the world seems to be getting smaller: travelers can go most places with relative ease, borders are open for trade, and the Internet allows us to connect withpeople wherever they may be. At the same time, the world has also become more fraught andcomplicated: displacement of large groups of people due to war and conflict, economicdisparities between the so-called First and Third Worlds, and anti-immigrant confrontations andlaws leading at times to violence. What is it like to grow up in such a world? What is it like todiscover one's self in a world that seems to present infinite possibilities, yet somehow remainin disarray? In what way can the things that happen in far-off places \"over there,\" affectone's life \"over here\"? These are just some of the questions this course will be grappling withthrough film and literature that take us on journeys to places like Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Iran,Spain, and Hawaii. Together we will examine how these texts depict the challenges of comingof age in the context of globalization and how people's lives are changed by this globalized 126world. CSP30 ENVIRONMENTS, EARTHWORKS, AND ECOCRITICISM: CONTEMPORARY ART AND ECOLOGY. Thankfully, it is no longer the case that ecologically-minded art is dismissed as \"tree hugging.\" What this means, however, is that the history of art is in need of re-writing\u2014and that is what wewill do together in this course. By examining artists such as Robert Smithson, structures suchas habitats, images such as those of disaster, genres such as landscape, and discourses suchas speciesism, we will consider how artists, art historians, and environmentalists haveimagined nature and humans' relationship to nature. We will debate whether (and how) it isincumbent upon the contemporary art world to direct its attention to ecoaesthetics andconcentrate its energies on sustainability and remediation. What would real change look likeand what is visual art's capacity to \"picture\" that? CSP31 WORKING TOWARD THE HEALTHY CITY: ENVIRONMENT, PEOPLE, AND HEALTH. Can cities and metropolitan areas grow in ways that are healthy, socially just, and environmentally sustainable? This course explores these relationships and posits that goodurban governance coupled with empowered communities can help lead the way. Particularfocus is placed on investigating the nexus between the built environment and health. Filmsand a field trip will complement readings, lectures, and discussions. Cultural Studies Program Spring 2015 \"Global Issues\" Research Seminars CSP50 CULTURE OF FOOD. What do you like to eat? Who prepares your food, and who is at the table eating it with you? In this course we will take on these and related questions, covering aesthetic, historical, social,and cognitive approaches to food studies. In addition to critically examining cross-cultural aspects of food culture, students will engage with Los Angeles food culture. This is an 8 unit colloquium and seminar course. Students enrolled in this colloquium will not only get credit for the first year spring seminar requirement, but also will meet the CoreProgram's Cultural Studies Distribution requirement for Global Connections. CSP51 DOCUMENTARY DISCOURSE. Provides students with writing instruction situated in documentary film. For better or worse, documentary has become one of the main ways we access truth today. We will write about avariety of non-fiction films, treating them as examples of visual argument. Some possiblethemes include mockumentary, visual anthropology, rockumentary, queer documentary,propaganda films, and many others. Scrutinizing the truth-telling techniques of the directors,we will test the limits of non-fiction filmmaking. Students will come away from this classunderstanding what makes for effective arguments, both in their own writing and indocumentary film. Effective composition will result from an awareness of the importance ofaudience, voice, context, and argument. 127CSP52 JAPAN AND KOREA THROUGH FILM AND FICTION. Through the mediums of cinema and fiction, this course will introduce students to the similar, yet vastly distinct, societies and histories of Korea and Japan. In addition to work from greatstorytellers such as at some less \"celebrated\" and perhaps more popular works. At the end of thesemester, it is my hope that students will not only come out with a better understanding, butmore importantly a greater appreciation and interest in the Korean and Japanese peoples. CSP53 BECOMING AMERICA: THE SHORT STORY. Following the revolution, America gradually evolved a collective self-image different from that of Europe. One way to track this construction of our national identification is through one of ourfavorite media of representation, the short story. This class will trace the development of theshort story from the early 19th century to recent post-modern versions. While the chronologicalexpanse of our seminar will be vast, our readings each week will be relatively brief. Our focuswill be on intensive understanding and responsible contextualization and analysis. While wewill attempt to master the basic elements of narration theoretically, we will also try tounderstand the specific innovations of each writer as they contribute to the formation of ourcollective mythology. CSP54 TBA CSP55 ANIMAL ETHICS. Humans eat some non-human animals, keep others as pets, perform scientific experiments on others, keep some in zoos, and hunt others for both food and sport. The complex relationshipbetween human and non-human animals raises a host of important moral questions: What dowe owe to non-human animals? Do animals have morally permitted toeat/experiment on/keep in zoos/hunt non-human animals? What is the relationship non-human and concern for the environment? CSP56 THE \"ART OF THE WEST\" AT THE AUTRY: CURATION AS CULTURAL PRACTICE. In the summer of 2013, the Autry opened a new set of galleries that joined works of art from the collections of the Autry and Southwest Museums. The newly renovated galleries embody adramatically different story about the \"Art of the West\" than has been offered since themuseum opened in 1988. The exhibition integrates works by Native American, Euro-American,Hispanic and other artists within spaces previously given over to paintings, sculptures, andobjects of material culture by European American artists. Students in this seminar will learnabout how scholars have traditionally written the art history of \"the American West\", whilesimultaneously considering the impact that multiculturalism and more community-enteredmuseum practice has had on institutions like the Autry. In this course, students will interact withAutry Curatorial, Library, and Education department staff; conduct research on individualobjects on view in the Autry's exhibition; and create a collaborative digital projectdemonstrating the scope and significance of that research. CSP57 TBA CSP58 FROM THE PHONOGRAPH TO AUTO-TUNE: EXPLORING THE CULTURES OF RECORDED MUSIC. Writing in 1906, the American composer John Phillip Sousa expressed grave concerns about what he termed the \"menace of mechanical music.\" According to Sousa, the advent of devices 128like the player piano and the phonograph threatened to remove \"the human skill, intelligence, and soul\" from music and reduce it to little more than \"a mathematical system of megaphones,wheels, cogs, disks, and cylinders.\" More than a century later, musicians and audiences todayhave embraced musical technology in ways that would have been inconceivable in Sousa'stime. How did the introduction of such technologies transform musical culture at the turn of thetwentieth century? And how has the subsequent development of new musical technologieschanged the way people both produce and listen to music? Through the examination of adiverse range of literature, films, archival materials, and sound recordings, this course willexplore the complex and continually evolving relationship between music and technology --from the primitive phonograph introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877 to vibrant culture of digitalsampling, MP3s, and Auto-Tune of the present day. CSP59 \"OVERLAPPING DIASPORAS\": BLACK DIASPORIC THOUGHT AND ITS REVERBERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. In The Practice of Diaspora, Brent Hayes Edwards thinks through Earl Lewis' concept of \"overlapping diasporas\" to suggest that the use of the term diaspora \"implies neither that itoffers the comfort of abstraction, an easy recourse to origins, nor that it provides a foolproofanti-essentialism: instead, it forces us to articulate discourses of cultural and political linkageonly through and across difference in full view of the risks of that endeavor\" (12). In thiscourse, we will examine literature by African Americans as well as Iranians, Palestinians, andEgyptians to understand how distinct social, cultural, and political differences can actuallyinform and engage one another in the struggle against colonialism. For instance, how didFrantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth work its way into the 1979 Islamic Revolution ofIran? What role did the Black Panthers play in the Palestinian struggle for liberation? Why didMalcolm X turn to Islam as a tool of liberation and resistance? How did Pan-Africanisminfluence and inform Pan-Arabism? These are some of the issues we will cover in this course. CSP60 THE DEMOCRATIC IMAGINATION. Few political ideas have engaged the public imagination with as much moral force and political complexity as democracy has since the classical period. This course is an exploration of theideal of democracy in the political imagination of prominent philosophers, politicians, activists,and artists from ancient Greece to the present. The aim of the seminar is to introduce studentsto major themes in the study and experience of democracy: the balance between liberty andequality; pluralism and difference; membership and exclusion; moral versus political sources oflegitimacy; radical versus deliberative democracy; democracy and war; democracy and socialjustice; and the relationship between democracy and the humanities. Democracy's appeal andinclusive functioning stem from the way in which the pursuit and struggle for, and the continualelaboration of, democratic ideals reflect and speak to the multiplicity of voices and experiencesin society. This course introduces students to the lives and circumstances that account for theevolution of democracy as both a political form and an idea in the modern imagination. CSP61 BLACK PARIS: THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE AND THE FRENCH CONNECTION. During the early 20th century Paris was a center of intellectual activity for writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance as well as Caribbean and African thinkers. This course will examinethe international elements of the Harlem Renaissance, addressing themes such as Jazz AgeParis, the Pan-African congress, Negritude and Garveyism. Readings will include works by andabout figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker and L\u00e9opoldSenghor. CSP 62. THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. 129Americans are simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by prisons, prisoners, and prison life. A consistent reminder of this fascination is the proliferation of an array of reality TV programsexposing life behind prison walls and the popularity of fictional programs and movies aboutprison life. This course transcends the voyeuristic obsession with prisons and takes ameaningful look at the reality of imprisonment. My personal contact with prisons and prisonersduring my years as a public defender and prisoners' rights advocate has taught me that theprison population exists outside of the democratic sphere. This experience has afforded me adeeper appreciation and understanding of core democratic principles of freedom, civil liberties,human rights and equal protection and has energized me to advocate for those principles onbehalf of disenfranchised individuals and communities. I believe that students who studyincarceration will develop a greater appreciation and understanding of broad democraticprinciples. CSP63 THE TRICKSTER IN CHINESE NARRATIVE. An archetypical character appearing in myths, folk tales, religious texts, and literature, the trickster ironically transgresses cherished social conventions and beliefs in order to create newor reaffirm existing conventions. This seminar will first examine the trickster as a literary motifand question how such a construct can limit our understanding of the trickster of specific timesand places. We will then explore how Chinese writers used the trickster to challenge literaryand cultural norms in a variety of texts, including historical, religious, and philosophical texts;literary and folk tales; and the Ming-dynasty novel, Journey to the West, featuring the naughtyMonkey King, Sun Wukong. CSP64 TBA CSP65 URBAN FICTIONS: THE MODERN CITY IN LITERATURE AND OTHER ARTS. This course will examine texts of fiction, poetry, essay, music, film and graphic arts that have as their subject the problems and promise of urban life in major world-cities of the 19th and20th centuries. Among the cities we may explore through their imaginative representation areLondon, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Mexico City. Field study in LosAngeles may be incorporated as pertinent events or opportunities come up. CSP66 THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR. This seminar will study and reflect on the literary, filmic, and historiographic descriptions of wars in the 20th and 21st century, with an emphasis on WWI, WWII, the Vietnam War and therecent war in Iraq. How are the reasons for \"going to war\" presented, who promoted them? Who fought against the wars? Why were the voices of the opponents not heard? How are thedead and the victims commemorated? Do we learn from wars and are they still accepted as\"natural\" events? What are the limits of re-presenting wars in literature and film. CSP67 RENAISSANCE INDIVIDUALS. Experience the European Renaissance of the 14th through 17th revival, artistic and scientific innovation, religious reform, and global exploration. Consider the relationship of contemporary\"individuality\" to the characteristics of men and women of early modern times. Films willhighlight the multi-varied individual, like the courtesan and poet Veronica Franco, as well asthe confrontation between artist Michelangelo and military pope Julius II. A source reader willprovide practice in analyzing texts, as well as objects of material culture, in an age ofencounters between cultures. For a research-based essay utilizing evidence from the times,each student will focus on two individuals in a field of the student's interest such aspolitics/diplomacy; court life; sexuality/gender; crafts 130scientific experiment and enlightenment; mapping the globe; or travel and encounter. Learning collaboratively, students examine the lives of a diversity of men and women and thecontroversies their lives provoked. CSP68 MUSIC AND TRANCE: HOW MUSIC INFLUENCES THE ECSTATIC STATE THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. This course explores the relationship between music and consciousness in different world cultures with the intention of developing an understanding of the role that music plays inecstatic experiences. This course draws on ethnomusicology, psychology,anthropology, dance ethnology, and religious studies. CSP69 POLITICS, CULTURE, AND SPORTS. Sports offer paths to glory for athletes; they create shared emotional experiences for competitors, spectators, and fans; they give cities, states, and nations a common purpose.What, then, can sports teach us about politics, culture, and society? This class uses criticaltheory to study amateur and professional sports in the contemporary United States. Studentswill analyze sports institutions, organizations, and teams to explore ethics, racial and socialjustice, patriotism and nationalism, and economics. Specific topics may include collegeathletics, team mascots, concussion epidemics, the public financing of sports stadiums,marketing practices, Olympic boycotts, and doping. By thinking analytically about sports,students will reflect on how the industry shapes narratives about opportunity, identity, andnationhood. CSP70 MAPPING RELIGIOUS IDENTITIES: RACE, PLACE, AND EMPIRE. How do particular spaces invoke a certain sense of religious identity? What makes a place sacred or holy? How does the inside of a temple or Cathedral cause someone to behavedifferently than they would in the quad of Occidental? Scholars have become interested in theways spaces, both real and imagined; have the potential to make meaning for many people.This course introduces students to the concepts of space and place and how they relate toreligion. We will read primary sources from a variety of religious traditions which demonstratethe deployment of religious languages, rituals, and spaces, from antiquity, to the present. Indoing so we will consider religious identities as new geographies and in this way, map the wayspace and place contribute to the broader forces of empire, globalization, and multiculturalism. CSP71 LIBERAL ARTS AT THE BRINK? NAVIGATING THE CRISIS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. Unemployment, student loan debt, and protest are colliding with rising education costs, endowment building, branding wars, and labor outsourcing. At this tumultuous moment inhigher education, this course asks students to reflect on the fate of liberal arts educationthrough a focused analysis of its past and present. Specifically, how do economic pressuresand technological innovations impact the sustainability of liberal arts values such as socialjustice, serving the public good, and cultivating a \"life of the mind\"? Students will debate andsynthesize arguments about the value and sustainability of liberal arts education by viewinghigher education from the perspective of private corporations, governments, collegeadministrators, faculty, parents, and students. In so doing, students will learn to situate theirpersonal experiences within broader institutional, historical, economic and political contexts.Through reflective essays that incorporate both primary and secondary sources, students willdevelop critical thinking skills, authorial voice, and a sense of ownership over their owneducation. They will also be introduced to interviewing techniques and textual analysis that willserve as a basis for future independent research. 131CSP72 EXISTENTIALISM. Existentialism is a philosophy that grapples with the problem of human freedom and moral choice in a world that often seems devoid of transcendental meaning or purpose. In thiscourse we will read literary and philosophical texts from the French, German, Hispanic, andRussian existentialist traditions, and will explore the structures and possibilities ofconsciousness, knowledge, desire, imagination, aesthetics, ethics, and political commitment.Authors studied will include Albert Camus, Fydor Dostoevsky, Franz Mallea,Ernesto S\u00e1bato, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Leo Tolstoy. CSP73 ISSUES OF SPANISH IN THE U.S. This course discusses issues surrounding the Spanish language and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. The course focuses on the connection between languageand culture, and addresses the social issues surrounding the status of Spanish in the UnitedStates, specifically language attitudes and ideologies, language policy, bilingualism andbilingual education. We will challenge common beliefs surrounding language and bilingualism,and its effect on Spanish speaking communities in the US. CSP74 THEATER ABOUT THEATER. It can be argued that, since the Renaissance, theater artists have been communally and delightedly inspired by a certain subject: themselves. From the plays within Shakespeare'splays A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet to Pirandello's meta-theatrical examinations ofself in Six Characters in Search of an Author and Tonight We Improvise to Broadway's send-ups of the production process Noises Off and The Producers -- no theatrical subject matterintrigues quite like the making of theater. What are these artists saying about the nature of theirown art form? Where do they converge? How do they differ? What is so consistently alluringabout the act of performance? Students will explore these questions and various plays throughin-class readings, artist visits, and attendance at live performance. Other Cultral Studies Program Courses - CSP 99: \"Experiencing the Arts\" This course is designed to expose students to the arts, to broaden their cultural horizons, and to instill in them a desire to expand their knowledge of and attention to the arts. In addition, thecourse is designed to prepare students for life-long learning, for engaging in their communities,and for having the basis for further exploration in the field of the arts. Students may acquireone semester unit of credit for attending 8 on-campus events (out of those specificallyidentified for this course) during any semester. Students will select these events from a list ofevents compiled each year by the Director of Core; at least 2 of the 8 events attended must bedesignated starred events which will combine an arts presentation with a lecture or discussion by the artist or faculty member. This 1-unit course is graded CR/NC only and will not meet any specific Major/Minor norCore requirement. 132To complete the requirement and due before the last day of class, a two-page reflection paper must be turned in electronically. In an email with specific details, all students willreceive a prompt prior to the due date. Students may take this 1-unit course for up to two semesters, for a maximum of 2 unitsbeing applied toward graduation. What former CSP 99 students have said... \"In many ways your time at Oxy is defined by academics and what happens in the classroom.Learning how to prepare for class, take tests, and even reflect are all crucial parts of theacademic process. Something that I think needs to be stressed more often is the visceral,exploratory nature of a program like CSP 99. Throughout the semester, I have learned toappreciate different forms of expression, and how people are able to approach even simpletasks with very different strategies.\" \"Experiencing the arts offers students a unique opportunity to enjoy a variety of events put on by Occidental College. These events provide a chance to expand ones intellectualengagement and increase ones musical interest. Authors, musicians, plays, and dynamic filmsare all offered to broaden students wealth of knowledge. These events reach out into the LosAngeles community to bring various professionals onto campus where they can engage theminds of Oxy's youth. They provide students with an opportunity to learn about variousprofessions from those who have found success. I have acquired a new wealth of knowledgefrom participating in these events.\" \"All of the events I attended this semester were more intriguing than initially expected. Based on other students who had previously taken the class I figured the events would be insightfulbut my experiences with the events were more impactful than others credited.\" - CSP 98: \"Experiencing Los Angeles Cultures\" This course is designed to expose students to some of the many cultures of Los Angeles, a vibrant microcosm of the \"complex, interdependent, pluralistic world\" of the 21st centurydescribed in Occidental College's mission statement. Students may acquire one semester unitof credit for participating in five off-campus \"cultural encounters\" during a semester. Studentswill select these events from a list compiled each year by the Core Program or they maypropose their own experiences for approval. A short two-page paper is due on the last day ofclass. This course is graded CR/NC only and will not meet specific Major/Minor or Core requirements. Students may take this course twice, for a maximum of two units being applied toward graduation. Faculty 133Regular Faculty John Swift Associate Dean for Core Curriculum and Student Issues; English and Comparative Literary Studies; Core Program; Advisory Committee, Urban and Environmental Policy B.A., Middlebury College M.A., Ph.D., University of Virginia Critical Theory & Social Justice Critical Theory - Social Justice (CTSJ) is fundamentally interdisciplinary, drawing on ideas fromacross traditional academic disciplines. \"Critical\" refers to various bodies of theory andmethod?Marxism, psychoanalysis, the Frankfurt School, deconstruction, critical race studies,queer theory, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and intersectionality?that interrogate theessentialist assumptions that underlie social identities. \"Social justice\" refers to an extrajuridicalconcept of fairness that is focused on exposing and ending social inequalities. The aim of theCritical Theory - Social Justice department is to promote understanding of how categories suchas \"race\", \"sexual orientation,\" and \"nationality\" help people recognize and combat someinjustices and hinder them from recognizing and combating others. The department's course offerings are divided into three levels: 100-level classes teach students how to think critically about a wide range of topics, including race, gender, sexuality, and nationality. 200-level classes teach students how to participate in a seminar, including how tocontribute to class discussion and how to research and write a scholarly paper. 300-level classes teach students a major body of critical theory or a researchmethodology. Requirements MAJOR: The major in Critical Theory & Social Justice requires ten courses (40 units) selected in consultation with the student's departmental advisor. Each CTSJ major chooses anemphasis in one of three areas: Critical Race Studies, Postcolonial Studies, andFeminist/Queer Studies. Three courses must be taken in the chosen emphasis area and atleast one course must be taken in the other two emphasis areas. Of the ten courses, at leasteight must be offered by the CTSJ Department, including at least one 4-unit course at the 100level; one at the 200 level; and three at the 300 level, including the Junior Seminar (CTSJ390); and the Senior Seminar (CTSJ 490). All majors must take two 4-unit methodologiescourses, at least one by the end of the junior year. At least four of the units must be inexperiential learning. Each student is required to submit a major declaration that outlines whatthe student defines as her/his goals for completing the major. COURSES IN CTSJ EMPHASIS AREAS: Each student must take 3 courses in the chosen emphasis area and 1 course in each of the other 2 areas. Students may count the same course for a maximum of two different emphases (i.e. \"double-dip\") for courses that aredesignated for multiple emphases. Students may also choose to do two emphases within the 134major.

Other courses may count; decisions will be made in consultation with the student's advisorand the department chair . SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT : In their senior year, students majoring in CTSJ are required to complete a comprehensive project concerning a topic of the student's ownparticular interest. Students produce drafts of their projects during CTSJ 490: Senior Seminarin the fall semester of their senior year. (A student graduating in December is encouraged totake 490 in his or her third-to-last semester, rather than in the last semester.) Each student isdirected to consult with at least one CTSJ professor in addition to the professor teaching thesenior seminar. The final version of the comprehensive project is due the Friday before spring(or midterm) break of the student's final semester. A typical project culminates in a 20- to25-page paper. The department is open to critical projects of comparable length that employother media from students formally trained in those media. A comprehensive project earns thegrade \"Pass with Distinction\" if the department faculty determine that it is of the qualitypublishable in the CTSJ Journal or another journal in the fields embraced by Critical Theory &Social Justice. 137HONORS: Students majoring in CTSJ must be nominated during their senior year by a CTSJ faculty member to be considered for Honors. Nominations will be reviewed by the CTSJ department faculty, who will consider the nominee's excellence as a CTSJ major by examiningher/his GPA in courses taken for the major, quality of the comprehensive project, andengagement with community-based learning and research. Nominees must meet the minimumoverall GPA of 3.25 set by the College for Honors. Students interested in being considered forHonors may apply during the first semester of their senior year to enroll in CTSJ 499: HonorsThesis by conferring with their academic advisor and the instructor of CTSJ 490: SeniorSeminar. Permission to enroll in CTSJ 499 does not guarantee that the student will receiveHonors; the student's completed comprehensive project will be considered along with theadditional criteria listed above in consideration for the designation of Honors. Courses 101 - Critical Theory - Social Justice Colloquium The Critical Theory-Social Justice Colloquium introduces students to the CTSJ major. Studentswill engage with topics and materials in the areas of emphasis within the major: Critical RaceStudies, Gender and Queer Studies, and Postcolonial Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 105 - Immigration and Education This course will locate the topic of immigration and education within historical, legislative, andcultural debates on what it means to be an American and who has the right to an Education.Students will explore and debate precedent-setting Supreme Court cases, such as Mendez v.Westminster, which challenged the segregation of Mexican children into separate schools, andLau v. Nichols, which fought hard for non-English speaking students to have linguistic accessto the public school curricula. In addition, students will research the historical antecedents tothe recent anti-immigrant movements in California, Arizona, and Colorado, which target theuse of languages other than English in school settings, and have all but abolished bilingualpublic schools. Against this historical and legislative backdrop, students will examineethnographic research detailing the persistent challenges that immigrant children face inschooling, including migrant children, and the ways in which they, their parents, andcommunities experience those challenges. Satisfies the experiential learning requirement 106 - Representing the Metropolis In the United States, roughly 80% of the population lives in urban regions (2000 US Census),while according to United Nations figures, about 52% of people are urban-dwellers worldwide.This course will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film,literature, and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today is the product of multiplehistorical, cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider howcities have been shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our ownexperience and understanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasingglobalization and mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As weconsider representations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world,including some from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the cityhas played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what wayshas the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve to 138normativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in rural spaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the citypromote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some ofthe many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema and literature.As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complex understanding ofhow cities shape our cultural imagination. Emphasis Topic: Postcolonial Theory. Same asEnglish 106.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL AND GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 140 - Critical Theories of Sexuality This course introduces students to critical theories concerning human sexuality. We read feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, structuralist, and poststructuralist theories of sexuality anddiscuss what makes each of these theories \"critical.\" Topics include the political economy ofmarriage, the relation between sexuality and procreation, uses of the erotic, homosociality, andthe incitement to discourse. The authors we read include Engels, Freud, de Beauvoir, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Gayle Rubin, Andrea Dworkin, Foucault, and Judith Butler. Emphasis Topic: Queer Studies. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 180 - Stupidity Stupidity is neither ignorance nor organicity, but rather, a corollary of knowing and an element of normalcy, the double of intelligence rather than its opposite. It is an artifact of our nature asfinite beings and one of the most powerful determinants of human destiny. Stupidity is alwaysthe name of the Other, and it is the sign of the feminine. This course in Critical Psychologyfollows the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Gilles Deleuze, and most recently, Avital Ronell, in aphilosophical examination of those operations and technologies that we conduct in order torender ourselves uncomprehending. Stupidity, which has been evicted from the philosophicalpremises and dumbed down by psychometric psychology, has returned in the postmoderndiscourse against Nation, Self, and Truth and makes itself felt in political life ranging from thepresidency to Beavis and Butthead. This course examines stupidity.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 186 - Introduction to Critical Theory This course introduces critical theory in the context of the problem of social justice.Introductions will be made to psychoanalytic, Marxist, Feminist, Structuralist, Deconstructive,and Postcolonial Criticism. Reader-responses, New Criticism, lesbian, gay, and queer criticismwill also be surveyed. There will be close readings of the work of Louis Althusser, GeorgesBataille, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida as well as in depth readings of essays by GuyHocquenghem, Julia Kristeva, and Trinh T. Minh-ha. 210 - Mother Goose to Mash-Ups: Children's Literature and Popular Texts 139Why did the London Bridge fall down? Is Rub-a-dub-dub really about bath time? Why didn't an old man live in a shoe? Who is more imperialist, Babar or Peter Winky gay? children's show? a Hero? How tired was Rosa Parks? Usingdifferent critical approaches, this course will examine children's poetry, picture books, novels,cartoons, feature films, and music videos. Analysis will include topics related to gender, race,culture, and nation, as they play out in the aesthetics, images, and poetics of children'stexts. Emphasis topic: Critical Race Theory CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 211 - Critical Pedagogy Critical pedagogy aims to develop collective critical consciousness for the purpose oftransforming oppressive socio-political conditions. In this course, students will study criticalpedagogy from historical, political, and sociological perspectives. Students in the course willconsider traditional student/teacher relationships, pedagogical approaches, as well ashierarchies of knowledge promulgated by schools and textbook publishers. Students willanalyze and critique theories of the Frankfurt School and the emancipatory works of PaoloFreire, the most renowned critical pedagogist. Additionally, contemporary readings from HenryGiroux, bell hooks, and Peter McLaren will focus on critical pedagogy in relation to socialstructures, globalization, media, and race. Emphasis topic: Postcolonial Theory CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 215 - Critical Discourse Analysis This seminar introduces students to discourse analysis as the ontological and epistemologicaldeconstruction of every day language and symbols and their relationship to power. Throughoutthe course, students develop techniques for gathering and analyzing multimodal transcripts ofnaturally occurring conversations, interviews, discourses in institutional settings, mediadiscourses, and texts of historical materials. The course draws from systemic functionallinguistics, genre/text studies, multi-modal semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, and criticalsocial theory to understand how linguistic features of texts constitute and are constituted by thesocial, cultural and local relations, processes and contexts in which they are embedded.

Within the rubric of those three themes we will look atactivities by the U.N. family of agencies, other international organizations, and NGOs on issuesthat include the management of violent conflict, human rights and how they have beenmainstreamed into the work of international organizations, and approaches to economicunderdevelopment that seek to alleviate both poverty and insecurity. Prerequisite: DWA 101. 220 - International Political Economy This course is an undergraduate survey of the field of international political economy (IPE). Itis intended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field ofinternational relations and are interested in exploring international economic relations at adeeper level. The course covers major theoretical, empirical, and policy perspectives. Thetheme to be explored in this course is \"National Interest vs. Global Governance?\" - that is, wewill explore the theory and history of international political economy as an extension of national 151interest and an arena for the development of global governance, and the question of whether or not these two dimensions of international political economy are compatible or competitivewith each other. The first part of the course will cover the basic concepts and theoreticalfoundations of IPE. The focus is on core theoretical principles and approaches. The goal is tounderstand how theory is framed and \"works,\" the potential inferences of this theory, and theissues of contention within the field. The second part of the course draws on the theoreticalfoundations to examine a set of specific international economic issue arenas, includinginternational trade, finance and economic development. SAME AS POLS 232 221 - International Development Against the backdrop of 840 million persons worldwide suffering from malnourishment andnearly 1.3 billion people living on less than a dollar per day, this course surveys the field ofinternational development, wealth creation, and global welfare from an historical, global andcomparative perspective. It will introduce students to the field's academic contours, buildingfrom the historic role of economics in pioneering and undergirding the field to a broadunderstanding of now inter-disciplinary field that has emerged. The multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary perspective of this introductory survey course is in keeping with an emerging globalconsensus that measures of poverty go beyond income and consumption and that povertyreduction requires bridging disciplines (economics, political science, history, anthropology,geography) and methods (quantitative and qualitative, observational and participatory). Thecourse will be divided into two parts. During the first part of the course, students will beintroduced to the main theoretical ideas on social, economic and political development thathave informed the field's evolution. This will familiarize students with fundamental thinking ondevelopment as well as the frontiers of research. The second part of the course will exploresome of the current debates about development.

In the course of these discussions, students will learnabout national and international mechanisms for the promotion and enforcement of humanrights, such as the incorporation of treaties into national law, the use of the Alien Tort Statute inthe United States, and the decisions of the Inter-American Commission and Court of HumanRights. They will also have a chance to examine the United States from a double perspective:one the one hand, as a key country with a major interest and impact on human rightsconditions in Latin America, and on the other, as a country with its own policy areas of struggleand progress.CORE REQUIREMENT MET - LATIN AMERICA and REGIONAL FOCUS 230 - Gender and International Human Rights This course will explore the evolution of women's rights as human rights, the struggle ofwomen's movements to place gender-specific concerns on the international human rightsagenda, and the relationship of the UN and its agencies to the broad feminist goal ofadvancing the political, economic, social, and cultural status of women. While \"women\" are ofnecessity central to the concerns of this course, the study of human rights will be approachedfrom a gender perspective, recognizing that gender relations is key to understanding thenature, occurrence, and prevention of rights violations. Key themes to be covered in the courseinclude the relationship between the \"crisis of masculinity\" and women's human rights; genderand economic rights, gender-based violence, and health and human rights 231 - Gender & IR This 2-credit seminar explores how assumptions of masculinity and femininity have informedfoundational concepts and theories in the field of International Relations, the determination ofwhat is considered to be worthy of investigation and what qualifies as appropriate methods ofinvestigation, and who is (and is not) recognized as a subject of international politics. It appliesa gender lens to practical concerns in the field, including political and economic development,the environment, human rights, and violent conflict. And it engages the tensions associatedwith theorizing gender and IR, given the fluidity and intersectionality of identity. In the spring, a2-credit seminar will be offered that focuses more in-depth on the theme of gender and 153security. 2 units 232 - Gender & Security This 2-credit seminar explores how taking gender seriously unsettles the traditional dominancein International Relations of state-centered and military-oriented approaches to security. Thecourse will engage questions such as: What are the consequences of women's invisibility insecurity theory and practice? Who is being secured by security practices? What is therelationship between gender construction, militarism, and war? How is conflict gendered? Whatis the relevance of gender to conflict resolution, peace-building, and post-conflict justice?2 units 233 - Development and Human Rights in South East Asia The course will explore the tensions that have arisen in South East Asian countries betweenthe promotion of economic development and the realization of human rights. Through casestudies of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, we will engage in critical thinking anddebate, examining such topics as the legacy of colonialism in the region; state-civil societyrelations; the politics of religion and ethnicity; the construction of gender roles and identities;and the implications the tsunami disaster has had on both development and human rights inthe region.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND EAST ASIA 234 - South African Politics This course examines the political dynamics of apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa.Particular emphasis is placed on the development of black political opposition since the 1970s,including both militant action against the state, as well as inter-ethnic political action andviolence.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 235 - Nationalism and Ethnicity This course will explore nationalism and ethnicity from both a theoretical and empiricalperspective. Nationalist and ethnic discourses have always been central to politicalmovements, rebellions and revolutions. The passions and commitment of individual membersin these movements often leads to political ideologies and war tactics that are violent andwhich encompasses entire communities. The course will use examples from Southern Africa,South Asia and Eastern Europe. 237 - Cuba, China, Vietnam: Communism in a Post Communism World The course will examine some of the communist countries that have survived the collapse ofthe Soviet Union, specifically: Cuba, Vietnam, and China. We will discuss the political andsocial life within each country, their relationship to the United States and the prospects forpolitical change.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 154238 - South Asian Diaspora This class will focus on South Asians who were indentured to British colonies from 1860, immediately following the abolition of slavery. Over one million Indians were indentured toMauritius, South Africa, Guyana, Trinidad, and Fiji. South Asians currently constitute asubstantial proportion of the population in each of these countries, and they are in the majorityin Mauritius and Trinidad. We will conduct a comparative study based on theoreticalperspectives related to diaspora's, globalization, trans-state identities, and analytical themesassociated with identity andcitizenship. 240 - Comparative Revolutions This course will examine why, how, and when voices of dissent turn into a full-scalerevolutionary movement. We will compare and contrast revolutions that have taken place indifferent social, political, and cultural contexts (e.g., Nicaraguan Revolution, 1989 Revolutionsof Eastern Europe, and the Ukrainian Orange Revolution). 241 - International Relations of the Middle East A study of Middle-Eastern international relations in the context of three themes that structurethe region's modern political history:1. Colonialism: how the reaction against colonialism continued to define and limit Middle-Eastern politics, both internally and in its relations with outside powers.2. Religion: in particular, political Islam (or \"fundamentalism\") is a key variable in the region'scontemporary politics, but by no means all-defining.3. Nationalism(s): a source of political identity and mobilization. How religious, national,linguistic, and ethnic nationalisms inform conflict and cooperation within the region. In the context of these three themes, we will explore the following regional issues with global implications:1. The Arab-Israeli conflict. The flash point of conflict in the Middle-East, the Arab-Israeliconflict can only be understood on the basis of an informed appreciation of its historical andideological underpinnings.2. Iran. The Iranian revolution had an enormous impact on regional and international affairs.Current unrest within Iran is, perhaps, a harbinger of yet another radical shift in Iranian politics.3. Domestic upheaval in the region as seen in the Arab uprisings of 2011-12. . Despite this being an \"IR\" class, on-the-ground social and political movements (\"domestic,\" yet transnationally informed) have an enormous impact on the region's politics. This is particularlytrue in the shadow of the recent Arab uprisings on which we will place particular attention.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST and REGIONAL FOCUS 242 - Revolutionary Iran in Historical Perspective Iran has experienced crisis, revolts, and revolution more than any other country in the region.The level of revolutionary zeal, ideological debates, and mass participation has elicitedunprecedented attention by media experts and academics's endeavoring to resolve what istermed as \"Persian Puzzle\" infrequency ofrevolutions, Nikki Keddie - the eminent scholar of modern Iran ? has devoted years of research 155in striving to answer the question, \"why has Iran been revolutionary?\" She reiterates that Iran has seen more modern revolutions than any country in the Muslim world and more than mostcountries anywhere. Consequently, the course on \"Revolutionary Iran\" addresses the followingquestion: Is there anything peculiar or particular about Iran that could explain the rise ofmodern revolutionary movement? The course critically examines the theoretical and historicalperspectives that have been proposed to answer this question.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 243 - Law, War Crimes and Transnational Politics This course will focus on the international community's efforts since World War II to bring anend to impunity for those who violate fundamental human rights and humanitarian norms.International efforts to bring violators to justice from Nuremberg to the International CriminalCourt will be the primary focus of the class. The class will also discuss more recent efforts tobring civil lawsuits against individuals and corporations for their complicity in human rightsviolations. 244 - Modern Iran: Society & Politics This course is a survey of Iranian politics and society from the establishment of the Qajardynasty in the late nineteenth century to the present. The aims of the course are twofold. (1)To introduce students to major events shaping Iranian politics over the last century. Among thetopics covered are the rise and demise of the Qajar dynasty, the Persian ConstitutionalRevolution, the rise and fall of the Pahlavi dynasty, the role of Western imperialism, thegeopolitics of oil, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq war, the crisis of theocracy, etc.,and (2) To expose students to a set of theoretical and analytical issues underlying Iran'spolitical development: the causes and consequences of revolutions; state-society relations;secularism modernization; fundamentalism and reform; pluralism and democracy;autocracy and clientelism; corruption and the rentier state. Above all, this course is design tohelp students think, talk and write in an informed and critical manner about politics in modernIran.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST and REGIONAL FOCUS 249 - Public Health & Human Rts: Global and Local Practices This course explores core concepts in global public health, the development of human rights'instruments, and how these two fields have increasingly intersected in global and local publichealth work. Specifically, we will review public health methods of measurement and analysis --spanning epidemiological, economic, and political approaches -- to understand if and how arights-based approach to health can inform more critical and more productive approaches toissues such as HIV/AIDS and other sexual and reproductive health concerns. Finally, thiscourse examines how global public health issues have generated dramatically differentresponses across and within regions and countries and communities. We will particularly focuson the experience of Brazil given its changing role in the global economy and its progressivepublic health approach. Same at UEP 209 250 - International Security This course is an introduction to international security and strategic studies. This field is 156fundamentally about both the use of force by and violent conflict among states and non-state actors. The course will be guided by general theoretical questions regarding security: Howdoes violent conflict, or competitions shaped by the lurking possibili\u00acty of such conflict, affectinternational relations and individual societies? How has the role of violent conflict ininternational politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of securitytoday? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions.Such questions will include: How do states and non-state actors use force to persuade theirenemies to take (coercion) or refrain from taking (deterrence) a particular action? How cannations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What hasdetermined success and failure, the intensity, duration, and consequences of military action?We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues, intra-state security,and the relationship among security, development and state failure. Pursuing answers to thesequestions will require an approach that integrates theory, history and current events. Same as POLS 233 252 - Security Issues in South Asia While Washington policymakers during the Cold War paid only episodic attention to SouthAsia, the region has become a focal point for U.S. security policy over the last decade or so.Since the nuclear weapon tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, their entrenched, conflict-pronestrategic rivalry has acquired a much more dangerous edge. The region is also the epicenter ofglobal terrorism, with Islamabad simultaneously acting as a sponsor of the Taliban forcesfighting in Afghanistan and serving as a pivotal U.S. ally in the war against Islamist terrorism.Finally, after decades of disdain about India's strategic potential, U.S. officials have investedsingular energy in recent years in developing what is a tacitly anti-China security partnershipwith India. Although South Asia encompasses a number of countries, this course will focus onthe region's two most important powers - India and Pakistan - and their relationships with theUnited States and China - the two extra-regional powers that have the most influence onregional affairs. The following topics will receive special attention: The sources of andprospects for the India-Pakistan strategic rivalry, including the long-standing territorial disputeover Kashmir and the more recent competition for influence in Afghanistan. The effects ofnuclear proliferation on India-Pakistan interactions. The economic rise of India and itsimplications for New Delhi's security posture, especially vis-\u00e0-vis Islamabad, Washington andBeijing Pakistan's national prospects and their security implications. China's growing role inregional security affairs The emergence of non-traditional security challenges in the region(e.g., conflicts over access to natural resources, population pressures.) The impact of SouthAsian security issues on U.S. strategic interests, the development of U.S. bilateral relationswith India and Pakistan, and the management of the triangular relationship.CORE REQUIREMENTS MET: INTERCULTURAL 253 - Security in Asia China's return (as opposed to rise) to its proportional place in the global economy hasarguably caused a pivot towards Asia by the United States. While America's hegemonic statusin terms of hard (military) power remains undisputed, China's gross domestic product maysurpass that of the United States as soon as 2017. This course is a seminar on Asian security,covering military security, non-traditional security, and economic and political security, amongother dimensions. The course surveys the Asian region with particular emphasis on SoutheastAsia (the ASEAN countries, particularly Cambodia, Burma/Myanmar, Thailand, and Singapore)and Northeast Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The material is divided into 157three parts. The first provides an overall introduction and overview of Asian security and focuses on the foundations of what was thought to be the Asian Miracle (created in part from aUS security umbrella) just as the Washington Consensus rose to prominence. It takes studentsthrough the Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. Part II of the classes focuses on Japan,South Korea, China, and Taiwan. It describes their development trajectories and securityarrangements. Part III uses China as a platform to examine other parts of Asia not alreadycovered, such as China's relationship with Southeast Asia and the political economy of non-traditional security, in particular the region's experience with Highly Pathogenic AvianInfluenza.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: REGIONAL FOCUS 254 - Transnational Security: Understanding Gray Area Phenomena The course will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the evolving scope anddimension of transnational security in the contemporary era. The unit will include anexamination of the principal features of the current international system that are serving tofoster gray area phenomenon; an analysis of five specific threats that have received particularattention in terms of their destabilizing potential (terrorism, drug smuggling, weaponstrafficking, maritime piracy, the spread of disease, pandemics, environmentaldegradation/change); and an assessment of how these challenges can best be mitigated atboth the domestic and global level. 255 - Understanding Terrorism and Global Security through Cyborgs,Zombies and Morgoths The course will use popular culture allegories as a strategy for building a complexunderstanding of the nature of transnational terrorism in the post-9/11 era and challengesfaced by policy makers in this arena. It will begin with a review of key approaches andconcepts in security studies and will confront different definitions of terrorism. The course willthen go on to discuss certain policy responses that have elicited particular concern, such astorture, assassination, surveillance programs, detention without trial and deliberateentrapment. Cyborg, Zombie, and Lord of The Ring allegories will serve to illustrate differentconceptual and practical approaches to terrorism. The course will conclude with anexamination of the different implications for policy decision making suggested by the use ofdifferent allegories. 260 - Model United Nations Research, discussion and analysis of important issues in international relations in preparationfor a three day college conference in early April. Student delegates role play as ambassadorsfor countries and present views, negotiating with other representatives and arguing for possibleresolutions in a simulation of the United Nations. 265 - Global History of the United States: 20th and 21st Centuries This course will examine the political, military, economic, and cultural interactions between theUnited States and the rest of the world from the Spanish-American War to the present day.Taking a much broader view than traditional diplomatic histories, the course will weavetogether analyses of major diplomatic initiatives, armed conflicts, and the ways in which the 158cultures and economies of the U.S. and other nations have influenced one another. Topics will include the causes and consequences of wars, the meaning of American empire, and the flowof consumer goods, languages, music, dance, motion pictures, fashion, social norms, andpeople to and from the U.S..CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 266 - History and Theory of International Politics This course aims to introduce students to both analytic and normative approaches to the studyof international politics. In the first part of the course the historiography of both the states-system and the academic discipline of International Relations (IR) are examined, along withthe methodological issues underlying IR (and the social sciences in general). The second partof the course is devoted to learning about theories of international politics - e.g. (Neo)Realism,(Neo)Liberalism, (Neo)Marxism, Post-modernism/-structuralism, Gender and IR,Constructivism - and examining the debates within and between them. The Last part of thecourse considers the application and implications of theories discussed to and for majorpresent-day trends and developments such as globalization, militarism, financial crises,extremism, and environmental degradation. This course is, above all, designed to helpstudents think, talk and write in an informed and critical manner about international issues. 280 - Globalization: Issues and Controversies The course explores the various facets of the globalization process, its causes and wide-ranging consequences, and its implications for U.S. domestic and foreign policy as well as forglobal governance. Has globalization benefited East Asia, Africa, and Latin America? Whathave been the differing impacts on those regions? Questions that will be addressed include:*what are conceptual perspectives on globalization? impact has globalization hadon issues such as global health and illicit trafficking in peoples and goods? *what are thepolitical consequences of globalization? *what to the challengesglobalization presents?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 281 - Media & Global Change This course will explore the past present and future role of media in shaping global change andguide students in the development of a global media campaign. The campaign will be theculmination of an inquiry around media as a tool for social change. From pivotal news eventsof the last 20 years, to the rise of reality television, social media and declining influence of printand broadcast journalism, this course will use media literacy, case studies and comparativeanalysis of news coverage, critical analysis of cinema, trends in art and culture to exploremedia's impact on social norms and cultural-narratives. Specifically, we will examine the roleof media in various revolutions worldwide-- the recent role of social media in the overthrow andtransition of the Egyptian government (The Square), the role of song in South Africa's strugglefor freedom and international news coverage of the Feminist Movement and the Black Pantherparty. How is it that movements are organized using media as a tool for social-change?Professional writers, media executives and branding experts will be guest speakers for viewing-salons that will be scheduled throughout the semester. Students will: learn media literacy skillsand develop critical thinking by engaging with the role media plays in major historical, cultural 159and social issues; become active learners as they gain proficiency to approach their own personal inquiries with creativity and scholarly rigor; gain expression through visual storytelling,data visualization and social media as they create their own Global Media campaign andpresent it at a final salon for the course; and participate in the shaping of the narrative aroundglobal social change. 282 - Global Los Angeles A critical examination of greater Los Angeles and it's economic, political, social and cultural tiesto the world economy and other countries--all the ways in which Los Angeles is an integral partof the post-Cold War global society. How does this globalization affect the life of Los Angelesand in what ways does Los Angeles contribute to globalization? What are the positive andnegative impacts and the implications for US foreign, economic and social policies of LosAngeles as a Global City?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 283 - Soft Power: How Nations Interact Without War This course will study how the concept of Soft Power--first developed by Harvard professor JoeNye--applies to interactions among nations in the 21st Century. Soft Power lies in the ability toattract and persuade, whereas Hard Power--the ability to coerce--grows out of a country'smilitary or economic might,especially in Imperial/Colonial period. Students will analyze howtrade, culture (music, food, sports,language,education), environment and political institutions(democracy, corruption, human rights, etc.) contribute to a country's Soft Power and make upits Global Brand. Students will analyze the current state of Soft Power in key nations, andconsider how countries and their citizens can affect the attractiveness of a country's culture,ideas and institutions to raise its Soft Power. The course will introduce students to the idea ofglobal Sustainable Diplomacy which pursues global goals using Soft not Hard Power.Prerequisite: DWA 101 or Politics 101CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 284 - Sports and Diplomacy in a Globalized World A critical examination of the political and economic role that sports plays in the globalizedworld-- the diplomatic, political and economic effects of the Olympics, the World Cup, otherinternational sporting events, and the increased globalization of professional sports leaguesacross national boundaries. A look a case studies of Ping-pong diplomacy, rugby reconciliationin South Africa, and soccer wars in Latin America, as well as an analysis of the impact offoreign players on national economies and societies from American baseball players in Japanto Russian ice hockey players in the US.CORE PREREQUISITE MET: INTERCULTURAL 285 - Diplomacy & War This course aims to introduce students to both analytic and normative approaches to the studyand practice of diplomacy in international politics. In the first part of the course we will chart theevolution of diplomacy from a tool of statecraft in the modern states system to a practice ofmediating disputes and estrangement in international society. The second part of the course isdevoted to examining a series of historical case studies illustrative of the successes and 160failures of modern diplomacy. The last part of the course considers the utility and limitations of contemporary diplomatic practices for major international trends and developments such asglobalization, militarism, financial crises, extremism, and environmental degradation. Thiscourse is, above all, designed to help students think, talk and write in an informed and criticalmanner about complex and seemingly intractable global issues. 295 - Virtuous Drones, Selfish Humanitarians? Emerging Issues in IR What is the ethical goal of international policy? Who do we take seriously? Who do we count?What matters most? This is course is designed to help students, as future global citizens, explore ethical approaches to current global challenges. We will use case studies to confrontchallenges in areas such as torture, rebellion, peace-building, corporate responsibility, wartechnology, and climate change. Each student will develop special expertise in a specific policyarea, and will draft a report on pressing global issues in this policy area.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 295 - Topics in Diplomacy and World Affairs Human Security, An Introduction. In May 2003, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, and Professor Amartya Sen, Nobel laureate in economics,presented the report of the Independent Commission on Human Security to then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The report proposed a new security framework - that of \"human security\" -that re-frames the concept of international security away from the pillars of the Westphalliansystem - territorial integrity and national sovereignty - to a focus on the protection of personsand populations. This course is an undergraduate survey of the topic of human security, exploring this emerging concept and the evolving corresponding norm of the \"responsibility to protect,\" which demandsthat states protect their populations and re-frames humanitarian intervention as a responsibilityof the international community to protect peoples when their governments fail to do so.Throughout the course, we will explore a number of interrelated issues such as conflict andpoverty, protecting populations in conflict and post-conflict situations, crimes against humanity,and rights-based development.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Introduction to International Law . This course will introduce students to the legal rules and principles that apply to states and non-state actors in areas such as the use of force, humanrights, self-determination and the recognition of new states, and the prosecution of warcriminals. Students will explore the mutual impact of international law and politics, and assessthe efficacy of international rules as policy instruments, and as guidelines for legitimateinternational behavior. Course materials will include decisions of national and internationaltribunals and real-life problems that illustrate how international law works in practice. Whilefocusing on the development and application of global rules and looking at a variety ofcountries in the process, this course will take a particularly close look at how the United Stateshelps to make and applies those standards of international law.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS . Global Public Health. The course will examine major global public health problems and the range of responses from international organizations, transnational networks, and domestic andcommunity-based institutions. Despite improvements in the health status of low- and middle- 161income countries over the last half-century, the challenges to advance global public health remain daunting. What are the sorts of strategies these actors have used in addressing suchhealth issues as HIV/AIDS, malaria, unsafe food and water, tobacco use, and others? What isthe role of human rights in addressing the underlying determinants of ill-health? The course willpresent basic concepts for understanding global public health, including morbidity, mortality,demography, epidemiology, and the political, social and economic determinants of health. Wewill utilize a case study method to examine successful and less successful efforts to improveglobal health and to debate enduring political, economic, social and cultural controversies inthe arenas of global health. Students can expect to gain knowledge of the major issues andactors in global public health and an introduction to the analytic and quantitative skills neededto monitor and evaluate evidence used in formulating policies and programs. Same as UEP295CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL The Political Economy of Global Conflict . This course aims to introduce a number of fundamental concepts in the field of international political economy and then demonstrate arelationship between those concepts and global conflict. The first section of the course isdevoted to introducing several core concepts of IPE within the context of the more generalizeddebates about the relationship and interaction between the international and domestic and therelationship and interaction between the state and society. After establishing this theoreticalfoundation, we begin to explore the way a political economy-centered approach helps usexplain and understand interstate and intrastate conflict around the world. A number of casestudies provide common ground for exploration on topics such as the relationship betweenglobal conflict and the economic rise of China and India, trade disputes, the relationshipbetween poverty and conflict, and the relationship between natural resources and conflict(particularly intrastate violence). In each of these cases, our political economy approach isused not only to explain but also to explore possible solutions and challenges. In this context,the relative importance of international institutions and the challenges associated withcollective action are also discussed.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Obama Foreign Policy A course in current US foreign policy focusing on the challenges abroad faced by the Obama administration. The course will examine how President Obamaand his team handled two wars inherited from the Bush administration, as well as aninternational economic crisis--and how the administration responded to new developmentssuch as the Arab Spring. In an election year, foreign policy can sometimes become acampaign issue, and events abroad can affect Presidential politics, so the course will alsoconsider the role of foreign policy in the 2012 Presidential campaign.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES International Relations of Africa This course examines the international relations of states in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on major themes that have characterized international politics inAfrica since the end of the Cold War. We will pay particular attention to the constraints thatpoverty and state weakness place on African states, as well as the associated importance ofnon-state and external actors in African affairs. Sample topics that the course will coverinclude: major conflicts of the past two decades (Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,Somalia, and Sudan), international peacekeeping, slow economic development, foreign aideffectiveness, epidemics, and food security.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: AFRICA/MIDDLE EAST 162299 - Qualitative Methods and Research Design The goal of this course is to provide students with some of the tools to embark on systematic inquiry in political science. It will introduce students to qualitative methods in political science,ethical issues in qualitative research, proposal writing and interviewing techniques, and finally,the essential components of a research paper (a proper research question, thesis, literaturereview, and case selection). Guidance through the Institutional Review Board process will beprovided. This course is geared towards students preparing grant applications to conductresearch abroad and/or those preparing for their senior comprehensive thesis since they willbe expected to apply the methods they learn to their own research topics. 2 unit 305 - Peoples, States, and Wars: Revolutionary Readings This course will address enduring challenges in global politics in the political, economic, and social spheres. These challenges will be contextualized through three prisms: 1. Evolvingnorms of international society and justice. 2. Histories of peoples and states. 3. Key intellectualworks that have both been informed by and helped construct collective understandings ofthese norms and histories. The challenge of war, nationalism/ethnic conflict, economicunderdevelopment, and international justice will be addressed through seminal texts, bothclassic and contemporary. In order to expand the scope of traditional international relationsinquiry, these texts will extend into related intellectual traditions. prerequisite: DWA 101 310 - Religion and Politics As of late, religion has re-emerged on the political stage offering different perspectivesregarding political norms, values, and behavior. In this course we will explore the various waysin which religion has been conceptualized and utilized in different political and cultural settings.Some of the questions that we will seek to answer are: In what ways can religion be separatedfrom politics? What are the roles of religion and religious institutions in political life? How doreligions and religious institutions respond to the challenges of a pluralist and secular modernworld? Prerequisite: DWA 101 or equivalent. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 325 - United Nations Internship/Practicum Internships are designed to enable students to learn experientially in an organization engaged in work relevant to their coursework in Occidental College's Program at the United Nations aswell as their broader academic and career goals. By gaining firsthand work experience at anUnited Nations Mission, a Specialized Agency of the United Nations or a related Non-Governmental Organization students should develop skills and knowledge that will help themin pursuing post-graduation employment. Prerequisite: DWA 201 and ECON 101 329 - Human Rights and Trafficking in Persons Trafficking in persons - the use of force, coercion, fraud, or deception for purposes ofexploitation - is the third most profitable form of illicit activity globally, following the traffic indrugs and arms. In this course, we will explore the different forms of trafficking, including 163domestic servitude, sweatshop labor, migrant agricultural work, and child soldiering, although the course will focus most closely on the topic of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation.Throughout the class, the causes, consequences, and responses to trafficking will be analyzedthrough a human rights lens. We will study the processes behind the construction of genderidentities, in order to gain insight into why particular populations are especially vulnerable totrafficking and why certain constraints exist to preventing and responding to trafficking at boththe domestic and international levels. We will study the relationship between trafficking andmilitarism, including the legacy of the United States' military presence in Asia for sex tourismand trafficking in the region today. And we will engage the debate over whether trafficking is a\"discourse\" that perpetuates relationships of dominance and subordination between the globalNorth and South. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 331 - Ethics, Religion, and International Relations - State Interest vs. Universal Morality An inquiry into the field of ethical inquiry in international relations with a particular focus on theincreasing recognition of the multiple frames of ethics contributed by the world's religions. It isintended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field ofinternational relations and are interested in exploring the subject at a deeper level. Ethics hastraditionally occupied an unenvious position in mainstream theories of international relations.Either it has been relegated to the margins of the field or placed in opposition to thecontingencies of state practice. Denying their own normative foundations, (Western) theories ofinternational relations traditionally ignored the relevance of ethics for the conceptualization andpractice of world politics. This course reviews alternative approaches to traditional internationalrelations theory by placing ethics at the center of the field. The course focuses on the ethicalunderpinnings of state practice, and analyzes a range of contemporary foreign policy issues inwhich ethical questions are likely to arise, especially the protection of human rights, thehistorical development and contemporary formulations of ethical norms for the use of force,and distributive justice in the global economy. Special emphasis will be given to religiousinfluences on national ethics; religion as a matter of conflict; religious communities astransnational agents for justice, protection of human rights, and peace; and ethical andreligious contributions to reconciliation, solidarity, and peacemaking. The theme to be exploredin this course is \"State Interest vs. Universal Morality?\" - that is, we will explore the question ofwhether or not these two dimensions of international relations are compatible or competitivewith each other. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing. 333 - North Africa and the Middle East: Islam and the Politics of Identity A study of Islam in North Africa and the implications of religious ideology on intra and interstate conflicts. The course will also analyze the relationship of the Islamic North to the rest ofAfrica and to the Middle East. Given in alternate years. Prerequisite: DWA 101. Open only to DWA majors with junior or senior standing.

This survey explores severaltheoretical questions about the relationship between Islam and democracy in the region: Whydid the region's experience with some seemingly representative/liberal forms of the politics (c.1930s-1950s) give way to the rise of authoritarian regimes? Why have various Islamist politicalmovements come to represent the strongest forces pushing for political reform, governmentaccountability, and democracy in the region? Does political Islam represent an obstacle/threatto the democratization of the Middle East or, alternatively, a necessary component fordemocratization? How are new forms of populist mobilization and political organizationreshaping politics in the region?

What are the lessons to be learned from pastattempts to reconstruct war-damaged or failed stages - e.g., the defeated axis powers Japanand Germany, war-torn Bosnia, or post-war Iraq? Can the United Nations provide the neededexpertise or is it up to the U.S. to do the job? Is nation-building a necessary part of a FreedomAgenda (as President Bush termed it) or a U.S. strategy of democratic enlargement (PresidentClinton's term)? If so, how can it be done effectively without acting in a neo-colonial manner?On a related topic, when is so-called Humanitarian Intervention appropriate and who decidesto do it?the U.N., the U.S., the European Union, North Atlantic Treat Organization, or otherpowers? Are new U.S. government agencies or new international organizations needed forthese tasks, if they are to be undertaken?

Junior or senior standing in DWA or Politics 370 - Democracy in Global Politics This course investigates the contours of historical and contemporary debates about democracyin global politics. The central aim of the course is to make such terms as \"pluralism,\"\"representation,\" \"freedom,\" and \"democracy,\" which simultaneously serve as hollow tropes incontemporary political discourse and as the basis for a secular religious faith for many on theleft and the right, more difficult. Rather than cleansing these terms of their complications,students are encouraged to see them from all sides, interrogating their maddening paradoxesand ugly undertones while never losing sight of their awesome possibilities. Accordingly, thiscourse is divided into three sections. The first section offers a historical/philosophical overviewof the rise of, and a variety of challenges to, the idea of democracy as both a political ideal andan institutional form from the advent of the American and French revolutions to today.

We aim to help our students understand how decisions are linked toincentives and how policies can help align individual incentives with social objectives, includingan efficient use of the world's resources and an equitable distribution of its output. We also aimto equip our students with the rigorous theoretical and empirical tools of our profession toenable them to better analyze and guide the decision making of individuals, the conduct ofbusinesses and nonprofit enterprises, and the policies of governments and internationalorganizations. The Department aims to ensure that students majoring in Economics (1) understand the framework that professional economists use to analyze social and economic issues; (2)recognize how economic behavior and policies can affect both the aggregate level ofprosperity and differentials in prosperity across members of society distinguished bycharacteristics such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status; (3) have proficient decision-making and problem-solving skills; (4) are competent in writing and speaking; and (5) possesscritical-thinking skills that enable them to apply the theoretical and empirical tools ofprofessional economists to a wide range of issues. Requirements ECONOMICS MAJOR: A major in economics requires a minimum of ten courses. Of these, acore of seven must be the following: 184Economics 101 and 102 (introductory economics); Calculus 1 or equivalent; Economics 250 and 251 (intermediate theory); Economics 272 (econometrics; requires Mathematics 146 or equivalent); Economics 495 (senior seminar). The remaining three courses may be selected from among the 300-level economics courses (electives) described in this catalog. In order to declare an economics major, a studentmust have completed Economics 101 and 102 and Calculus I (or equivalent). A typical schedule might be arranged as follows:First year: Economics 101, 102, and Calculus 1Sophomore year: Economics 250, 251, and Math 146Junior year: Economics and 300-level electivesSenior year: Economics 495 and 300-level electivesThe major can be completed in fewer than four years, but it is almost impossible to complete the major in less than three years. CHOOSING ELECTIVES: The economics department offers so many electives that it's helpful to think about how these electives might be grouped to give more intellectual continuity to a course of study. For example, students interested in obtaining a Masters in BusinessAdministration (MBA) and/or having a career in management are encouraged to completeEconomics 233 (Accounting and Financial Analysis), an internship, and either Economics 350or 326.

MINOR: Economics 101, 102, 250, and 251, Calculus 1, and two 300-level courses in economics (or Economics 272 and one 300-level course in economics). Please note that Calculus 1 is a prerequisite for Economics 250 and 251. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Economics will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by arranging (with the instructor) for an Economics 300-level course (or Economics 272) to be designated as the student's writingcourse. The writing requirement must be satisfactorily completed by May of the student's junioryear. Students who fail the requirement or who fail to meet the deadline will be required to bothtake a composition course in the senior year and demonstrate acceptable writing skills in thesenior comprehensive in order to graduate. Students should familiarize themselves with thedepartmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See the Writing Program andconsult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Met by passing the Major Field Test (MFT) in economics 185in February of the student's senior year and by completing Economics 495 in the fall semester of the student's senior year. The MFT is administered at the College, and students must signup for it in the fall semester of their senior year. Students who will be off campus during one ofthe semesters of their senior year must contact the department chair by the end of their junioryear. HONORS : Majors can earn honors by taking Economics 499 in the fall of their senior year and by writing and defending, in that class, a thesis that is judged by the department faculty to be of honors quality. Enrollment in Economics 499 is limited to students with GPAs of 3.5 or higher(both overall and within the department).

Prerequisite: ECON 101 or 102 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: CENTRAL/SOUTH/EAST ASIA and REGIONAL FOCUS 191337 - The Great Depression The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most significant crisis of capitalism in modern history. It was global in its reach, decreasing economic output and production and bringinginternational trade and finance to a halt. Businesses and households suffered from bankingcrises, the restriction of credit, as well as the loss of employment. In the recent 2008 financialcrisis, the memory of the Great Depression has often been invoked as a possible worst-casescenario. In this course, we will study the economic and historical circumstances that led to theinstability of the economies in the 1920s and the devastating crash that followed. We will learnabout the underlying economic models that explain the devastating economic collapse andanalyze the political, social, and cultural ramifications of the widespread economic crisis.These include the political challenges to the existing systems of parliamentary democracyembodied in Fascism and Nazism, as well as those from the left. We will examine the socialimplications of massive unemployment and mass poverty, including homelessness, familydissolution, and \"hoboism.\" We will look at cultural responses to the crisis, including attemptsto represent the crisis realistically, as in the \"New Realism\" movements, and efforts to offerdistraction from the devastation, such as the Shirley Temple and Busby Berkeley Hollywoodfilms. We will also discuss the role of the interwar Gold Standard in propagating the crisis andlook at policy measures taken to stimulate economic activity. Last we will analyze themacroeconomic lessons that have been learned from the Great Depression and look at theirimplementation and effectiveness in fighting the current economic slump. We will focus on theUnited States and selected European nations. Prerequisite: Economics 101 or 102. This is the same class as History 337. 340 - Behavioral Economics This course will provide an introduction to the relatively new field of Behavioral Economics.Standard models of economic theory provide a useful, but not always realistic way tocharacterize how individuals make decisions. In this course we will investigate the evidenceshowing how people may behave in ways that are not predicted by this standard theory.Individuals may exhibit nonstandard preferences, nonstandard beliefs, or nonstandard decision-making. We will look at each of these in turn with applications that may include saving, finance,labor supply, gift giving, voting, and addiction. The methodology of the course will not itselfdeviate from the standard way of doing economics; we will state clear assumptions, buildmodels, determine their logical conclusions, and think about how to empirically test both theassumptions and implications of such models. Prerequisite:Economics 250 350 - Managerial Economics The application of economic theory and analytical tools to business and management decisionmaking. Topics to be covered will include examples from a variety of fields, including pricing,ethics, entrepreneurial startups, strategy, new products, acquisitions, marketing, humanresources, and production.

It does so by analyzing the current macroeconomic policy challenges facing the United States from the vantage point of modern macroeconomicsand economic history. Students will read state-of-the-art empirical research inmacroeconomics and develop a sense for how macroeconomists conduct research and makepolicy recommendations. Special emphasis will be placed on exposing students to the majordevelopments of U.S. macroeconomic policy since the Great Depression and on the role ofhistory in guiding contemporary macroeconomic policy decisions and debates.

The course emphasizes the development ofanalytical, writing, team-work and presentation skills and is meant to be an opportunity forstudents to apply their economic training to specific topics. Complete descriptions of theseminars offered in a given year will be mailed out to students prior to the Spring registration.Senior status is required for this course. Students who will be off campus in the fall of theirsenior year must contact the department chair by the end of their junior year to arrange a substitute senior seminar. Prerequisites: Economics 272 (may be taken concurrently) and either Economics 250 or 251 Section 1 - Economic Development This seminar attempts to answer the following question, why are some countries so rich and others so poor. We will use economic principles to investigate how culture, religion, education,geography, climate, natural resources and the role of government and types of institutionsdetermine wealth and economic growth. The course will focus on conceptual issues and theirquantification, data analysis, and will not be oriented around mathematicalderivations. Prerequisites: Economics 272 and Economics 250. May not be taken by any 193student who has taken or is planning on taking Economics 320. Section 2 - Free Market Economics: The Austrian Perspective This seminar investigates an alternative approach to economics, the Austrian School of Economics, which emphasizes methodological individualism and subjectivism. The AustrianSchool traces its roots back to the works of the Spanish Scholastics of the sixteenth centuryand stress the importance of the individual, private property, limited government and theorganizing power of the free-market. Students will read from authors such as Menger, Mises,Hayek, Rothbard and Hoppe and evaluate various properties of a state-planned economyversus a decentralized free market economy. Prerequisites: Economics 272 and Economics 250. May not be taken by any student who has taken or is planning on taking Economics 309. Section 3 - Macroeconomic Policy since the Great Depression. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the U.S. economy has languished: unemployment has remained elevated, job growth has been anemic, and poverty rates have risen to levels notseen in decades. What should policymakers do to help get the U.S. economy out of thismess? The course revolves around this question. It does so by analyzing the current macroeconomic policy challenges facing the United States from the vantage point of modern macroeconomicsand economic history. Students will read state-of-the-art empirical research inmacroeconomics and develop a sense for how macroeconomists conduct research and makepolicy recommendations. Special emphasis will be placed on exposing students to the majordevelopments of U.S. macroeconomic policy since the Great Depression and on the role ofhistory in guiding contemporary macroeconomic policy decisions and debates. Prerequisites: Economics 272 (or permission of the instructor) and Economics 251. May not be taken by anystudent who has taken or is planning on taking Economics 351. Section 4 - Compensation, Productivity, and the New Economics of Personnel All sections of Economics 495 have as their goal to further develop students' analytical thinking, writing, team-work, and presentation skills. Our particular seminar will develop theseskills by applying economic analysis to various topics in personnel economics, includingcompensation and incentives, hiring, training, downsizing/buyouts, stock options, pensions,and teams, among many others. In order to add realism to, and applications for, the analysis,students will discuss and evaluate numerous real-world mini-cases and more formal HarvardBusiness School case studies. Students will be evaluated on the quality of their written work,team problem sets, written examinations, and the quality of their contributions to thediscussions of the case studies. A variety of class formats will be used. Prerequisites: Economics 272 (or permission of the instructor) and Economics 250.

Prerequisites: Education 201, 205 & 300 (concurrent or permission of instructor). 315 - Critical Pedagogy in Secondary Urban Schools In this course, the students will understand that unlike traditional perspectives of education thatclaim to be neutral and apolitical, critical pedagogy views all education theory as intimatelylinked to ideologies shaped by power, politics, history and culture. Given this view, schoolingfunctions as a terrain of ongoing struggle over what will be accepted as legitimate knowledgeand culture. In accordance with this notion, critical pedagogy must seriously address theconcept of cultural politics both legitimizing and challenging cultural experiences that comprisethe histories and social realities that in turn comprise the forms and boundaries that givemeaning to student lives. This course will ask students to conduct 15 hours of fieldwork toanalyze and evaluate the current state of urban education as well as see transformationalmodels that are possible CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 316 - Healthy and Safe Schools and Communities In this course, single subject students are provided multiple opportunities to learn and practice how personal, family, school, community, and environmental factors are related to students'academic, physical, emotional, and social well-being.

In keeping with Occidental'smission values of equity and excellence, students in English courses read the work of bothlong-studied writers and of those previously excluded from traditional literary history. Majorswill 1) become proficient in close reading and focused discussion of individual literary works,2) learn to situate those works in their generative historical, geographic and social contexts,and 3) become skilled in interpreting them through a range of theories and methods thatcharacterize the evolving discipline of literary studies. Non-majors will develop their capacity toengage in close reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing. Most courses in thedepartment are seminars or combinations of lecture and discussion. This pedagogicalorientation underscores the department's strong emphasis on faculty-student interaction andthe collaborative production of knowledge. Introductory survey courses (ENGL 287-289)expose students to the breadth and diversity of Anglophone literary history. Upper divisioncourses (ENGL 300 level classes) develop sophisticated skills in literary analysis, interpretivewriting, and oral presentation. Methodological and research-oriented seminars in thesophomore, junior and senior years (ENGL 290, 390 and 490) direct students in the practice of 202original independent analysis that places primary textual interpretation in dialogue with secondary critical research. Requirements MAJOR: A major requires a minimum of eleven courses (44 units). These must include three historical survey courses (ENGL 287, ENGL 288, and ENGL 289); students may substitute oneof the corresponding first-year survey courses (187, 188, 189) for its 200 level counterpart(287, 288, 289), but may not receive major credit for both (e.g. 187 and 287). Students mustalso take three sequential seminars (ENGL 290, ENGL 390, and ENGL 490) in theirsophomore, junior and senior years, respectively. The remaining five courses should bechosen in consultation with the student's adviser. But they must include one course from eachof the following four categories, with no more than two taken at the 200-level: Group I : Medieval and Renaissance Literature (courses numbered 210-229 or 310-329) Group II : 18th and 19th Century Literature (courses numbered 230-249 or 330-349) Group III : 20th and 21st Century Literature (courses numbered 250-269 or 350-369). Group IV : Emergent Literatures (courses that satisfy the department criteria for representing the study of literatures from historically marginalized groups or communities) [NOTE: \"Emergent Literature\" courses will typically fall under the Group II or III categories. However, they cannot count for both a period requirement (such as Group II or III) and theEmergent Literature requirement.] Students considering graduate work in literature are strongly encouraged to take additional English courses beyond the minimum of eleven in order to broaden and deepen theirknowledge of literary history and their practice of literary interpretation. They should also takeENGL 370: Literary Criticism. Most graduate programs require proficiency in at least oneforeign language. CREATIVE WRITING EMPHASIS : Students majoring in English may elect to take additional courses in order to complete a Creative Writing Emphasis, a special track that provides a strong background in both literary history and creative writing skills. Students choosing thisemphasis will take a total of 13 courses. These must include ENGL 287, ENGL 288, ENGL289, ENGL 290, ENGL 390, ENGL 490, and three courses from among the four upper divisioncourse categories noted above as Groups I, II, III and IV (only one of these may be a 200 levelcourse). The four remaining electives must be creative writing courses. At least two of thesemust be from the English department. Other departments and programs that have offeredwriting courses include French, Theater, AHVA, and Writing and Rhetoric. Students interestedin pursuing the Creative Writing Emphasis must work out a careful program in consultation withtheir adviser and the department chair. MINOR: Five courses (20 units); two courses from 287-290 (one first year course from among ENGL 187, 188 or 189 may substitute for its 200 level equivalent); and three other courses,two of which must be taken at the 300-level. ADVANCED PLACEMENT POLICY : English majors who have completed the AP test in 203English with a score of 4 or 5 may petition the department chair to be allowed to graduate with 10 courses (including all required courses and Group I-IV categories) rather than the 11specified above. JUNIOR WRITING REQUIREMENT : Students majoring in English satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing ENGL 390 in the junior year and receiving a notation of \"Satisfactory\" for its writing component. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT : All majors must take ENGL 490 (Senior Seminar) in the fall of the senior year, where they will design, develop, and complete a significant project involving literary research and analysis. The project will result in asubstantial essay of original interpretation and pertinent secondary research, and a formalconference-style oral presentation at the Senior Symposium held during the spring semester.See the department website for more details. HONORS : Honors may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in course work and who successfully develop their comps project into an honors thesis. To be eligible, students must have a 3.65 grade point average in courses taken toward the major andan overall 3.5 grade point average. Qualified students will be invited to apply for permission toproceed to honors by the department prior to the beginning of the spring semester. Uponreview by department faculty, students whose applications are accepted will register for ENGL499 (Independent Study), for two units in the spring semester. They will complete a thesis tobe orally defended before a faculty committee during the spring semester. Honors candidatesare encouraged to take ENGL 370, preferably in the junior year. For further details, consultwith your department advisor.

No more than two may be counted towardthe English major. 106 - Representing the Metropolis In the US, roughly 80% of the population lives in urban regions (2000 US Census), while according to United Nations figures, about 52% of people are urban-dwellers worldwide. Thiscourse will examine various representations of the modern metropolis through film, literature,and cultural theory. The city, as we experience it today is the product of multiple historical,cultural, and social forces. Over the course of the semester, we will consider how cities havebeen shaped by these forces, as well as how they, in turn, shape our own experience andunderstanding of culture, history, and social practices. In an era of increasing globalizationand mobility, the role of the metropolis continues to evolve and expand. As we considerrepresentations of the city in a variety of films and novels from around the world, includingsome from our own city of Los Angeles, we will interrogate the ways in which the city has 204played a formative role in how we imagine life in the contemporary moment. In what ways has the city become a vehicle for the production of culture? How does life in the city serve tonormativize certain notions of what it means to live in the modern world? How does life in ruralspaces complicate representations of modernity that take the city as their norm? Does the citypromote accessibility, or, alternatively, does it rigidify codes of exclusivity? These are some ofthe many questions we will address as we consume a spectrum of world cinema andliterature. As we work our way through the material, we will strive to develop a complexunderstanding of how cities shape our cultural imagination, with a particular emphasis onpostcolonial theory. This course is cross-listed as CTSJ 106 No prerequisite. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL, GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 189 - The American Experience in Literature A historical survey of the major literary genres from the colonial to the contemporary period, emphasizing the persistent thematics of the American experience from a cross-culturalperspective. This class is particularly suited for students interested in the ways in which well-known American authors are in conversation with African Americans, Native Americans, AsianAmericans, Latinos/as, and white women, who, until recently, had been left out of the literarycanon. Open only to first year students. ENGL 189 satisfies an equivalent requirement to ENGL 289 within the English major. Students may not receive credit for both 189 and 289. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES, U.S. DIVERSITY English courses numbered 200-289, with the exception of 280, are open to all students. English 290 is open to students who have completed the first-year fall CSP writingseminar. 205 - Wake of the Ancient The object of this course (as the three- or four-fold pun of its title implies) is not only to celebrate Ancient Literature on the occasion of its supposed passing, but also to highlight theways in which Ancient Literature has informed the creation of ? and might yet continue to re-inform our understanding of-many subsequent forms of literary expression. The course willbegin, therefore, with the close textual analysis of one or more ancient literary works, andproceed with a comparative study of a text (or texts) drawn from later literary traditions. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, English Writing 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 220 - An Introduction to Shakespeare An introductory study of Shakespeare's plays both as text and as performance. We will investigate five plays in detail in an attempt to establish our own relationship with theShakespearean text. We will then view at least three films of each play and inquire into theways in which these films seek to mediate our reception of the text, the influence this mediationhas upon our view of the text, and the specific means by which each cinematic interpretation ofShakespeare is constructed. Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, Writing and Rhetoric 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 241 - Race, Law, and Literature 205This course interrogates the crucial role of the law in British imperial governance by reading colonial legislation and court proceedings alongside works of nineteenth and early twentiethcentury literature,. Doing this allows us to examine how dominant legal paradigms weredisseminated in the era's cultural production, and, in turn, how cultural ideals reflected inliterature were materially implemented through the law. In addition, we will look at howliterature often provided a viable means of contesting the normative terms of the law. Majorrequirement met: Group II. CORE REQUIREMENT MET:CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 253 - African American Literature In this introductory class we will examine African American literature and culture by reading across genres that include multiple genres such as the slave narrative, fiction, the essay,theater and poetry.

Prerequisite: any first year fall CSP writing seminar, English Writing 201, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 255 - Twentieth Century American Fiction Dick and Deleuze: this course will consider the novels and short stories of Philip K. Dick, perhaps the most famous and original science fiction writer of the 20th century. To decodeDick's strange fiction, we will employ the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze especially as he wrote inassociation with the psychologist Felix Guattari. While students will only be required to view thetexts through close-reading, history, and genre considerations, our further objective will be toapply the notion of \"Schizo-analytics\"developed by Deleuze and Guattari to resist thematerialism of late capitalism and the mental confinements supplied by Freudian portrayals ofsanity. Prerequisite: Completion of Fall CSP Seminar or Equivalent CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 267 - The Death of Hip- Hop: Liner Notes to an Aesthetic Theory If the deaths of the novel, of poetry, of painting, of sculpture, and of opera might serve as indicators, then perhaps the death of U.S. hip-hop suggests it is transforming and moving intoa new phase. The thought-experiment inspiring this course does not question what hip-hopmight give to the world. On the contrary, it questions if the world can critically accept andappreciate what hip-hop might offer it. Theoretical readings include Tricia Rose's Black Noise , Adam Bradley's Book of Rhymes ; Jeff Chang's Total Chaos ; selections from Theodor Adorno's Aesthetic Theory and Philosophy of Music ; music will include the work of Notorious BIG, J Dilla, Kanye West, Lauryn Hill, Wu Tang Clan, Outkast, Badu. Prerequisite: CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES , U.S. DIVERSITY 272 - Major Figures: Du Bois and Hyperbolic Thinking This course is an in-depth engagement with the thought and activism of W.E.B. Du Bois. Despite the currency of some of his texts and concepts, only recently have scholars havecalled for a more focused engagement with Du Bois' vast and diverse set of writings. Somehave reduced Du Bois' legacy to a few salient points that they say cover his entire career;others have periodized his thought too rigidly to consider its flexibility. But neither of theseapproaches helps us understand how and why Du Bois spent over 70 years (and over 175,000 206pages) using philosophy, fiction, correspondence, editorials, novels, poetry, lectures, and historiographies to reformulate his understanding of African Americans in US society and theworld. This course involves close readings of Du Bois corpus, framing him as a key thinker ofmodernity, democracy, and the role of the intellectual through his ongoing analysis of theAfrican American.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 278 - Literature and Philosophy: Humor This class will attempt to find a theory of the laughable. We will read short stories and brief novels from Twain to Nabokov and philosophers from Aristotle to Nietzsche. 279 - Literature and Politics Body/Politics . Linking literature and politics, the course offers an interdisciplinary analysis of gender, power and the body. The theoretical center of the course will be Foucault's work on biopower. We will also look at issues of class and the body (including Chopin's TheAwakening, Larsen's Passing, and Atwood's Bodily Harm); egalitarian law and the female body(Wendy Williams, Mary Poovey); science and gender (Emily Martin, Thomas Laqueur); andpornography (Catherine McKinnon, Laura Kipnis). Race and multiculturalism can also beviewed through this lens, and we will read Morrison's Beloved. Judith Butler's work offers yetanother approach, questioning whether bodily differences determine sex or gender. RecentLatin American history of military rule and repression has emphasized the role of the body andmemory in political change.

Do aesthetics foster a more harmonious ordisharmonious national culture? Do aesthetics create more peaceful cities and craft a commonculture? Should its subject matter be legal resolutions to conflict and representations ofpeaceful communities? Or, is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literaturerepresent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law, like the manyfreedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system?How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be \"fugitive\"? How can the fugitivefighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective,we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditionalliterary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early tomid 20th century literature, this course will look back further, starting from the early 19thcentury to the very beginning of the 20th. will complement the literature by reading relevanthistorical materials from the abolitionist movement, labor movements, government debatesover Emancipation and Reconstruction, etc. The course will include literature from FrederickDouglass, Sojourner Truth, Walt Whitman, Ida B Wells, and Charles Chesnutt, among others,and will cover several genres, including oratory, autobiography, political pamphlets and shortfiction.

This frequent comparison does notexhaust the significance of the Great Depression for the US or around the world. What makesthe 1930s so intriguing is that the economic collapse spawned new or renewed older politicaland artistic movements across the globe. Most importantly, in the 1930s thinkers and artists allover the world not only rethought their political identities; they also pondered the very meaningof the political for the past, present, and the future. Art and philosophy were central to theirinvestigations. This is important for humanities scholarship because even if we are currentlyexiting the \"second Great Depression\" in terms of economic productivity, the questionremains: what cultural rebuilding remains to be done and how does art contribute to suchprocesses? 1930s writers took up this question in several different forms, through the trope ofthe document and its archival drive, the unconscious and the search for the Marvelous, theraised fist of labor movements or anti-racist activism. Simply put, what can the first GreatDepression of the 1930s teach us about cultural reconstruction in the second GreatDepression of the early 2000s?

We will cover multiple literary genres-including poetry, slave narrative,novel, and the essay, among others-used in the African American literary tradition placed intheir historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. By reading the African American literarytradition in these contexts, we will pursue a number of questions, regarding issues of politicalagency, the role of the writer as intellectual, the relationship of literature to the folk, andliterature as an avenue of recovering alternative histories.

Each of these-Pound, Eliot, Stein, Stevens, H.D., Williams, Oppen, and members of 213the New York School-undertakes ambitious experiments that expand the formal and perceptual bounds of poetry. The purpose of the course is to read each poem carefully and slowly; and tounderstand major artistic movements as they address culture, including war, urbanization andcapitalism, the fragmentation of identity, and changes in technology. We will specificallyexamine the use of collage. Students will have opportunities to write analytically and/orcreatively. T.S. Eliot: \"poets in our civilization, as it present, must bedifficult. Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level ECLS course, or junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNTIED STATES 359 - Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust The Holocaust has been positioned at the limits of representation -- as the indescribable, the incomprehensible. The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocauststands in contrast to the need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations.Attempts to represent the Holocaust, to describe and understand this event and itsimplications, are numerous and have occurred across a wide range of media forms (literature,film, photography, art, music, monuments, etc.), and genres (as in documentary, drama,comedy, science fiction). As the Holocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historicalwitnesses and survivors decline, these representations increasingly shape our perception andunderstanding of the event. This course will investigate literary, filmic, and artisticrepresentations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics, andhistory. We will begin with a historical survey and then turn to examining the various debatesand controversies surrounding the issue of representation of the Shoah and discuss some ofthe theoretical texts that have shaped the area of Holocaust Studies. Finally, we will explorethe ways in which these written, filmic, and artistic cultural artifacts have attempted to narratethe events of the Holocaust, and examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety ofmedia forms and genres. The course will deal with questions of ethics and aesthetics, such asthe meaning of art and the limits of historical representation. What are the aesthetic and ethicalimplications of creating art about the Holocaust? Does all representation entail anaestheticization of horror? What are the implications of the commercialization of theHolocaust? Students will obtain a basic grasp of the historical events; they will gain aninterdisciplinary, personalized, historical, and cultural understanding of this genocide; and areexposed to ongoing debates regarding the limits of representation of the Holocaust.

This course will focus on the global novel in English. By 1914 the British Empire had colonized almost 85% of the world, bringing diverse cultural traditions under the encyclopedic gaze of Western modernity. If part of the project of the colonial apparatuswas to collect knowledge of the world in ways that bodies, cultures, and landscapes could beunderstood and ordered by the West, contemporary societies are now negotiating their ownmeans of self-representation in the often violent space of postcolonial rupture. Throughout theterm, we will work with texts and visual images produced out of, and in response to, the historyof the colonial encounter. Drawing on a broad range of literary, filmic, and theoretical materialswe will develop strategies for understanding the production and consumption of postcolonialrepresentation, in both local and global contexts. As consumers of these cultural productswithin the space of the Western academy, we will be attentive to the function of the stereotype 214as we consider representations of gender and sexuality, violence and terrorism, class structures, and migration. Texts considered will include Arundhati Roy's The God of Small , and of Migration to the North . Prerequisite: Any 100- or 200-level English course, or junior or senior standing.

Through this engagement we will develop an understanding of thecomplex dialogue that emerges between literature and theory in the postcolonial context. Inaddition, throughout the course, we will look at how the many stylistic techniques (e.g., the useof patois, magical realism, temporal experimentation) that are particular to this body ofliterature not only develop a new mode of expression, but also interrogate the conventions ofthe Western canon. In this manner, our analysis of literature will be supplemented by aconsideration of postcolonial theory in order to contextualize the literature within an 215understanding of the particular historical, political, and social discourses from which it emerges. Conversely, our study of theory will be anchored in a discussion of the ways in whichit is materially practiced in its accompanying literary context.

We will focus especially on how scholars on the BlackDiaspora have thought critically and imaginatively about the archive, blurring the lines betweencritical discourse, historical investigation, and aesthetic representation. In this hybrid space,perhaps we will hear the silences that speak so loudly about black subjection and agency inthe archive. Theory from David Scott and Michel Foucault, text art from Glenn Ligon, travelnarratives from Saidiya Hartman, and poetry from the likes of Langston Hughes and MarleneNourbese Philip will aid our exploration.

Du Bois. Despite the currency of some of his texts and concepts, only recently have scholars have called for a more focused engagement with Du Bois' vast anddiverse set of writings. Some have reduced Du Bois' legacy to a few salient points that theysay cover his entire career; others have periodized his thought too rigidly to consider itsflexibility. But neither of these approaches helps us understand how and why Du Bois spentover 70 years (and over 175,000 pages) using philosophy, fiction, correspondence, editorials,novels, poetry, lectures, and historiographies to reformulate his understanding of AfricanAmericans in US society and the world. This course involves close readings of Du Bois corpus,framing him as a key thinker of modernity, democracy, and the role of the intellectual throughhis ongoing analysis of the African American.

Although the course could be described as astudy of marginal identity, its true focus is on nonidentity-the creative flux at the heart ofblackness and, by extension, humanity at large. The course stages an encounter between thetheories and aesthetics of the Black Radical tradition, on the one hand, and Western leftisttheory, particularly Marxism, on the other. We will read short, poignant essays/chapters fromtheorists like Cedric Robinson, Karl Marx, Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, and Niccol\u00f2Machiavelli.

Among the cities we may consider are London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Mexico City. Fieldstudy in Los Angeles may be incorporated as pertinent events or opportunities come up. Imaging the Image. The term \"photography\" means light writing. As such, it implies a form of language that is unmediated by authorial intention. What the history of photo application has demonstrated, whether digital or analog, is that photography often uses its appearance asunbiased to disguise its indebtedness to the tradition of image and the imaginary. Thus,photography and its varieties ? film, television, computer, etc. ? have come to represent ourtalent for virtualization, not truth. Since the 19th century, literature has explored this doubleaspect of photography ? as realism and as ideology or deception. This class will explore thisrelation using theorists such as Peirce and Berger. The works studied will range fromHawthorne to Dick. 378 - Literature and Philosophy Schools of Being in the House of Style. In this course, we shall attempt to come to terms with that most elusive feature of literary and all other arts: style. By surveying selected moments inthe history of philosophy, literature, music and the plastic arts, we shall put to the test the ideathat style, though non-propositional, may in fact have a kind of referent, a referent to which (touse the language of Heidegger) is not ontic, but ontological. Style, in other words, might betaken to refer not to any particular thing in the world, but to how things are, and come to be, ingeneral. The course will thus attempt first to discern some of the major stylistic shifts inWestern, aesthetic history, and then to theorize them. 380 - Creative Writing: Writing Identity In this multi-genre creative writing workshop, we will explore the paradox of identity. Author Sandra Cisneros' has said you should \"write about what makes you different.\" What does thismean and where does it lead you? How do we evoke culture, class, ethnicity in our work? Howcan we (and might we want to) situate our work in a specific time and place, to locate ourcharacters in a world so particular only we can describe it? Besides writing and sharing theirown work, students will be asked to read and discuss a variety of writers who explore identityand difference, including Gish Jen, Nam Le, Paul Beatty and JeannetteWinterson. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS 382 - Advanced Creative Writing Students familiar with the elements of craft-setting, characterization, plot, dialogue, etc.-will produce several new stories and revise them, and will read and critique the works of theirpeers. In class writing exercises and outside readings will also be required. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: FINE ARTS 390 - Junior Seminar in English The Junior Seminar is a small, discussion-oriented seminar required of all majors, emphasizing advanced critical approaches to a literary topic. Enrollment is restricted to English majors, who 218will pass the College 3rd Year Writing Requirement by satisfactory completion of the course writing requirements. Literature and Laughter . Mark Twain suggests that the funny comes in three varieties: the comic, the witty, and the humorous. Each of these corresponds to a disparity - of content, insight, and form - whose tension and potential energy may result in laughter. These genres ofthe laughable may, taken together, imply a more general and profound source of laughter inlanguage generally, a source of difference in the inherent inadequacy of the literal that is onlyrealized by the inarticulate and material activity of the body's laughing out loud at the mind'spretensions. This class will trace both the theoretical attempts to compass this irrationalphenomenon - from Aristotle's missing poetics of comedy through Spinoza, Hobbes, Bergson,and Nietzsche - and to apply these theories to short comic texts. In the end, we will attempt toconstitute a new understanding of the laughable as an affirmative but paradoxically post-personal expression of difference in the making. Textual Mappings: Space and Place in Literary Study . This course will consider the significant spatial turn in recent literary and cultural studies. We will review key works of geographic materialist theory and criticism, and apply their insights to our reading ofcontemporary world fiction, poetry, and graphic narrative. The primary works of literature (andperhaps some films) will be selected for their representation of social drama (or trauma) inregions and sites of heightened spatial contestation, or for their mediation of such spatiallydetermined social experiences as exile, migration, and urbanization. 490 - Senior Seminar: Comprehensive Project In this course seniors will design and carry out advanced research projects in areas of their own interests. Seminar meetings will be devoted to discussion of a core group of theoreticaland/or historical texts (varying from year to year) and to practical issues of sophisticatedliterary critical work. The course will result in a substantial critical paper, a version of which willbe presented at the spring senior symposium in satisfaction of Occidental's comprehensiverequirement.

The major accomplishes this goalby offering to students a set of coordinated experiences in the classroom, laboratory, and field.Geology is an intrinsically interdisciplinary science, drawing upon the tools of mathematics,physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and environmental science to examine problems thatrange in scale from a single mineral grain to the entire solar system. Geology majors learn to 220work together on inquiry-based laboratory and field projects, and each produces a Senior Thesis describing independent research they have undertaken with a faculty mentor. There isa special emphasis on articulating ideas orally, graphically, and in writing, skills that arevaluable not only in science but also in the many other careers where geology majors fromOccidental have found success. Geology is a global science, and so students who have madeprogress in the major as sophomores are encouraged to study abroad for a semester duringtheir Junior year. The Geology major expresses the Department's commitment to preparestudents to excel in an increasingly complex and environmentally stressed world. Requirements MAJOR: The following courses are required for completion of the major program in the Department of Geology: Geology 105 (or equivalent), 215, 225, 235, 305, 324, 325, 315 or 342345, 490, and at least three of the following: Geology 245, 255, 315, 342, 355, or 4 credits of390 or other approved geology courses.

The MINOR: Geology 105, 215, 235, and any other two courses in Geology to be selected with department approval.WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Geology will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by submitting a portfolio of at least two papers from any of the intermediate- or advanced-level writing-intensive Geology coursesnormally required for the major (or appropriate course work). Students should familiarizethemselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring the major. See theWriting Requirement and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The comprehensive requirement in Geology is met by a passing grade on the senior comprehensive project. The senior comprehensive project is based on research conducted under the supervision of Department faculty or in an off-campussummer research program or field camp. This project can be started as early as the Junioryear and typically involves field or laboratory work during the summer between Junior andSenior years. Seniors are expected to present their research orally and submit a written thesisby Spring Break. During the Fall semester of senior year, all Geology majors attend a seniorseminar (Geology 490 or equivalent). A major goal of these meetings is to help students maketimely progress on their comprehensive projects. HONORS: Students with a GPA of at least 3.25 are eligible to graduate with honors in geology. For these students, a larger senior thesis is planned, and students start their research earlier 221than the fall of their senior year. For this extra work, the honors student receives additional course credit beyond credit for comprehensives. Refer also to the general College policiesregarding the Honors Program.

San Diego State University German, Russian, & Classical Studies The study of a culture through its language offers insights into unfamiliar worlds which cannotbe realized in any other way; such study is one of the distinguishing features of a liberal artseducation. Moreover, competence in a language other than English can provide a decidedadvantage for any post-graduate education or career objective. In addition to literaturecourses, various culture courses (some taught in the language of study, others in English)make aspects of this cultural tradition available to all students. The Department also strongly encourages all students to investigate Occidental's opportunities for study abroad. In recent years, students from a wide variety of departments, including thesciences, have taken advantage of these programs, greatly enhancing their education and 226future opportunities. These programs exemplify Occidental's ideal of a liberal education that increases sensitivity to and appreciation of other cultures.

Classical Studies Please see the Classical Studies area of the catalog for information on minoring in ClassicalStudies. Classics minor Courses Classical Studies 227 Please see the Classical Studies area of the catalog for information on minoring in Classical Studies. Classics minor 202 - The Wake of the Ancient The object of this course (as the three- or four-fold pun of its title implies) is not only to celebrate Ancient Literature on the occasion of its supposed passing, but also to highlight theways in which Ancient Literature has informed the creation of-- and might yet continue to re-inform our understanding of--many subsequent forms of literary expression. The course willbegin, therefore, with the close textual analysis of one or more ancient literary works, andproceed with a comparative study of a text (or texts) drawn from later literary traditions, mostparticularly modern and contemporary treatments (the manifold ways for instance that Joycedraws upon Homer, Derrida upon Plato).CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 and EUROPE 222 - Myth: the Greco-Roman gods This course is a survey of Greco-Roman myth with a particular focus on the representation, function, and meaning of the gods. Students will study these myths in their original socio-historic contexts but a large portion of the course will be devoted to a historic survey of moderntheories of myth. This approach will allow students to appreciate myth's relation to the variousritual, philosophic, and artistic contexts in which they appear, both in the ancient world andbeyond.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 292 - Love's Song--A History In this course we will trace the European history of what we today call \"love,\" from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance, and shall do so through a careful examination of the literature thatsought to give expression to this ever-changeable and ever-provoking concept: the lyrics ofSappho, the dialogues of the satirically erotic \"technical manuals\" of Ovid, the Gospelsof Christianity, the troubled Confessions of Augustine, the courtly tales of knights in the MiddleAges, and the great all-encompassing journey of Dante's through heaven and hell in the DivineComedy. Significant attention will be paid to the way each of these works continues tocontribute to our own modern notions of love, in all their ecstatic, heartbreaking, inspiring andfrustrating complexity.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and PRE-1800 303 - Genres in Classical Literature This course examines the meanings, effects, social contexts and historic development of one of the major Classical genres: epic, lyric, tragedy, comedy, (to name but a few). In 2014-2015,the course will focus on the explosion of new literary genres (romantic comedy, in particular,but also biography, the anecdote, and philosophic dialogue) that followed in the wake of 228Alexander the Great's conquest of Greece, and the subsequent demise of the autonomous Greek city state. Attention will also be given to the long term effects of these new \"Hellenistic\"genres on subsequent European literary and cultural history, as it was primarily the Hellenisticsensibility (not the Archaic or Classical) that for the next 2000 years that was understood to berepresentative of the \"Ancient Greek\" perspective.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 and EUROPE German 101 - Elementary German I Introduces basic language skills, grammar, pronunciation, oral communication, and reading simple prose.

We will focus on the difficult transition from the old monarchy to aparliamentary democracy, the economic and political challenges of the new republic and itsslow demise in the early thirties. Some lead topics will be: the rise of film and other forms ofpopular culture, the styles of Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit, the experience of the city,the emancipation of women, and the fight against the onslaught of fascist tendencies. We willread texts by Bertolt Brecht, Ernst Toller, Erich K\u00e4stner, Kuhle Wampe and others) and studythe new trends in architecture (Bauhaus), the arts (Beckmann, Kirchner, Heartfield),photography, music and the media. The course is taught in English. German minors and groupmajors will read some of the texts in the German original. Prerequisite for German minors and group majors: German 201 or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 280 - Metropolis: The Modern City as Vision, Text, and Experience The onset of industrialization in the 19 th century created the modern metropolis and the angst and attraction of the lifestyle that went with it. In this course we will examine how writers and intellectuals of the late 19th and early 20th century described their experience of this new urban environment--analyzing their discoveries and discontents. In addition to fiction by Rainer M.Rilke, Emile Zola, Irmgard Keun, Alfred D\u00f6blin, Walter Benjamin and others, we will also 230discuss seminal texts by architects, urban planners and theorists and look at how visual artists and filmmakers depicted the emerging streetscape of modernity. Students will have theopportunity to explore the impact of modern urbanization in a contemporary and global contextthrough field trips and class projects. The course is taught in English. This course is not opento 1st year studentsCORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 282 - Nazi Visual Culture The rise and fall of National Socialism is one of the most intensively studied topics in European history. Over six decades after its collapse, Nazi Germany continues to fascinate the generalpublic, and with good reason. Although the fascist state lasted only for twelve years, it startedhistory's most destructive war while committing crimes of unprecedented proportions. For themost part, it did so with the acquiescence of the German public. This class will investigate therise of National Socialism as a political, social, and cultural phenomenon. The central focus willbe on the decisive role of film and the visual arts as most popular means of mass manipulation. Prerequisite: 1st year students cannot enroll in this class. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 288 - The Neo-Nazi Movement Decades after the fall of Nazi Germany, there is a growing concern that the spirit of Nazism still lives on. The Neo-Nazi movement continues to exist in Germany. A recent report revealed thatone out of twenty 15-year- old boys belong to a Neo-Nazi group. Neo-Nazism is not anexclusively German phenomenon, though - we find similar developments in other Europeancountries, in Canada, and in the US. This course will track the activities of Neo-Nazis inGermany from 1990 to the present. We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth ofright wing militancy throughout Germany, and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinheadactivities as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A keyquestion will be why exactly young people between 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups whooften use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally, the question will be asked what themost effective means of combating these movements would or should be. Prerequisite: Sophomore status or higher. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 320 - Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust in Literature and Film The Holocaust has been positioned at the limits of representation -- as the indescribable, the incomprehensible.The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocaust stands in contrast tothe need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations. Attempts to represent theHolocaust, to describe and understand this event and its implications, are numerous and haveoccurred across a wide range of media forms (literature, film, photography, art, music,monuments, etc.), and genres (as in documentary, drama, comedy, science fiction). As theHolocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors decline,these representations increasingly shape our perception and understanding of the event. Thiscourse will investigate literary, filmic, and artistic representations of the Holocaust, focusing inparticular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history. We will begin with a historical surveyand then turn to examining the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue ofrepresentation of the Shoah and discuss some of the theoretical texts that have shaped the 231area of Holocaust Studies. Finally, we will explore the ways in which these written, filmic, and artistic cultural artifacts have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust, and examineexemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of media forms and genres. The course willdeal with questions of ethics and aesthetics, such as the meaning of art and the limits ofhistorical representation. What are the aesthetic and ethical implications of creating art aboutthe Holocaust? Does all representation entail an aestheticization of horror? What are theimplications of the commercialization of the Holocaust? Students will obtain a basic grasp ofthe historical events; they will gain an interdisciplinary, personalized, historical, and culturalunderstanding of this genocide; and are exposed to ongoing debates regarding the limits ofrepresentation of the Holocaust. The course is taught in English . Prerequisite: 202 or 232 for German minors and Group Language majors . SAME AS ECLS 359 CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 325 - Crisis in Europe The European project - i.e. the gradual unification of the continent - which had been successful for decades seems to undergo a fundamental crisis at present. This crisis has differentaspects. Primarily, it has to do with the economic inequities within the European Union whichbecame tangible in the aftermath of the world economic crisis of 2008. In its wake, the\"weaker\" economies, mostly at the periphery, were more affected than the stronger ones. Butthere also other problems, such as the lack of democratic structures as well as strongleadership, the weight of a centralized bureaucracy, and the lack of a European public sphere.The course will take a look at the achievements of the European Union , the multiple reasonsfor its current crisis and the various attempts to overcome it. Prerequisite: Open to juniors and seniors CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 370 - Seminar on a Selected Topic Bertolt Brecht and the Twenties . Bertolt Brecht is one of the most influential playwrights and aesthetic thinkers of the 20th century. In order to understand the scope and dimension of his work and its world wide influence this course will focus on the artistic development of youngBertolt Brecht who, in the early Twenties, moved to Berlin, the capital of newly foundeddemocratic Weimar Republic and one of the most important cultural centers of the 20thcentury, and participated in practically all innovative tendencies and art forms of the time, fromExpressionism and Dadaism to New Objectivity, from experimental theatre to radio and film.Some of his great early works, such as the \"Three Penny Opera\", will be seen in the context ofthe time, especially the very turbulent last years of the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise topower. We will also look at Brecht's legendary film \"Kuhle Wampe\" and visit at least onecontemporary production of a Brecht play staged at a theatre in Los Angeles. Bertolt Brecht: The Great Plays. Brecht's great plays changed the stage of world theatre. In order to understand and appreciate their powerful and long lasting influence, all major plays written during Brecht's exile, i.e. in the years between 1933, when he was driven out ofGermany, and 1948, when he returned to Switzerland and ultimately Berlin, will be discussed.Aside from detailed analyses of plays such as \"Mother Courage\", \"The Good Woman of Galilei\" Brecht's developing theory of epictheatre and the general conditions and dilemmas of exile will be discussed. We will also look atBrecht's role in Hollywood, his collaboration on the film \"Hangmen Also Die\", and hissuccessful attempts to direct his own plays on German and European stages after 1950. 232Students minoring in German, or majoring in Group Languages or IPS will read most of the texts in the original. Prerequisite for German minor and Group Language majors: German 202or 232. Open to all other non-first year students. The course is taught in English, no knowledgeof German is required.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE ? FINE ARTS Memory, Trauma, and Victim Culture This course is concerned with the cultural politics of memory and trauma after the catastrophic events of the Holocaust and World War II. We willstart with basic questions, such as: Whose memories are sought, and commemorated in thepublic sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to representthem? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual andcollective memory? The first part of the course analyzes memory and trauma on both theindividual level and the collective level, and turns then to the specific processes that occurwhen traumatic events are remembered by survivors as wellas the collective processes involved when memories of traumatic events, such as theHolocaust, are shared with an audience who has no first-hand experience of them.- Thesecond part of the course aims to identify the recent fascination, especially in European andAmerican culture, with the phenomenon of trauma, suffering and victimhood. We will study thecultural politics of trauma and memory in relation to two events - the Holocaust and Germansuffering during World War II. The unit \"Holocaust victimhood and American-Jewish identity\"explores how the kitsch nature of popular culture representations of the Holocaust (from theAnne Frank movie of to the very successful TV-series Holocaust to the Hollywood movieSchindler's List) created the paradigm for trauma culture at large. The unit \"Germans incollective memory between perpetrators and victims\" discusses contemporary Germanmemory discourse which primarily focuses on the experience of German suffering as aconsequence of the war and the Third Reich.However, to recast Germans as victim is highly problematic since the position of victim isalready occupied by those people who were persecuted and murdered by the Germans/Nazis.Memory, trauma, and victimhood are crucial aspects of the experiences of Jews and Germansafter 1945. A systematic exploration of these aspects (as manifested in a broad variety ofcultural forms) promises important insights into recent history and culture.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL Offered in spring 2012 Nazi Culture. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, they took over control of all aspects of German life. One of the first tasks the new government undertook upon their ascension to power was a synchronization of all professional and social organizations with Nazi ideologyand policy. Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, beganan effort to bring German arts and culture in line with Nazi goals.The government purged cultural organizations of Jewish and other officials alleged to bepolitically suspect or who performed or created art works which Nazi ideologues labeled\"degenerate.\" Some 650 works by such renowned artists as Max Beckmann, Marc Chagall,Otto Dix, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee were \"degenerate and removed fromGerman museums. The Nazi \"cultivation of art\" also extended to the modern field of cinema,theater, music, architecture, youth education, and even to the lower levels of popular culture.Throughout the duration of the Nazi regime, 'culture' in all its manifestations played a crucialrole. Political rallies, military parades, sports events, open air festivals, and other skillfullyorganized events were used from the beginning to suggest a \"national awakening\" and the\"revolutionary spirit\" of the new regime. The efforts of the Nazis to regulate German culturecorresponded to what historian George Mosse calls an effort \"toward a total culture,\" i.e. an 233effort to influence at the most basic level the lives and actions of all Germans. This course will explore the various forms of culture during this time and will raise the question to what extent'Nazi culture,' or culture under Nazi domination, was capable of stabilizing the regime until itsvery end in 1945. German minors and group language majors have to complete either German 202 or 232 since they will read some of the material in German. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE Offered in fall 2011 Marx, Freud, and the Frankfurt School. This seminar will explore the origins of the world famous Frankfurt School, a group of German social philosophers and theoreticians which emerged at the Institute for Social research of the University of Frankfurt am Main in the 1920swho wanted a) to analyze the conditions of modern capitalism and its impact on society ingeneral, on family and social structures, value systems and mass culture, b) critically reviewthe theories of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Max Weber, and c) to establish the principlesand foundations of a 'critical theory.' We'll read and discuss major works by Max Horkheimer,Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Siegfried Kracauer, LeoLoewenthal and others. The seminar will focus on the 'first phase' of the Frankfurt School, itsbeginnings and its work and development during the thirties and forties - when the schoolrelocated to New York and many of its collaborators lived in other American cities or abroad -and the immediate post WWII period. (A second seminar will follow next year and explore theschool's development and its world wide impact in the sixties and seventies.) The course istaught in English. Students minoring or majoring in German will read some of the original texts(especially Marx, Freud, Benjamin, and Kracauer) in German. Prereauisite:Restrictedto Junior/senior. Same as CTSJ 370CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE The Frankfurt School, 1945 to the Present. Social Analysis, Cultural Theory, and Political Action. This seminar will explore the history of the Frankfurt School after World War II when itwas re-established in Frankfurt and began to play a crucial role in the development of a'critical theory' of society and culture during the West German 'economical miracle;'afterwards, with the onset of the German (and international) student movement of the mid-Sixties, it gained international reputation and impacted social, political, and cultural discoursesin countries like France, Great Britain, Italy, or the United States. We will study primarily someof the major writings of Th. W. Adorno (especially on art, music, cultural theory, and thelessons of Fascism), H. Marcuse (whose writings on social theory and aesthetics, on'repressive tolerance' and 'liberation' exerted a strong influence on the student movement),and of J. Habermas who became one of the most influential European intellectuals in thedecades after 1970. This seminar is the continuation of an earlier class on the beginnings ofthe Frankfurt School and its history until 1945; participation in that earlier seminar is notrequired. The course is taught in English. Students minoring in German or majoring in GroupLanguage or IPS will read some of the original texts in German.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 397 - Independent Study in German Individual study of a major author, movement, genre, or translation techniques.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 278 - In Stalin's Time Stalin was arguably the first totalitarian dictator who created the model for similar regimes in the twentieth century. This course describes the changes Stalin brought to Soviet society, theterrible consequences of his dictatorship, and the reaction of cultural figures criticized as theyrebelled against the system. This course examines those movements through popular culture,film, literature, and first-hand testimony. The everyday life of Soviet citizens will be studied bylooking at both permitted and forbidden forms of entertainment. The dissident movement thaterupted in the 1960s and 1970s will be examined through the Sotsart artistic movement, aswell as short stories that circulated underground throughout the late Soviet period. Finally, thecourse will look at Stalin's legacy in Putin's authoritarian Russia of the twenty-first century.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 282 - Slavic Pagan Culture and its Legacy The worldview and beliefs of the early Slavs, particularly the Eastern Slavs, were a complex synthesis of influences: Indo-European mythology, Central Asian shamanism, Scythian animalworship, and ultimately a \"paganized\" version of Christianity labeled by cultural historians as\"dvoeverie\" (double faith). This course examines all aspects of this culture as it developed inthe years 800-1600 in order to understand how these people viewed the world and how thisaffected their lives and the development of Slavic culture. Communal village life, legends, folkgenres, and mythology, their sources and their legacies, are examined. There is a close studyof the phenomenon of the vampire, following its evolution from the Iron Age into eighteenthcentury Serbia, as a specific case study of how myths are born and persist. The ways in whichpagan beliefs were incorporated into Christianity to create the \"dual-faith\" of the Russianpeasant are examined as well. In addition to analytical and historical texts, readings includetales of supernatural beings and phenomena as well as testimony concerning encounters withthe supernatural.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: Pre-1800 284 - Madness and Murder An examination of the phenomenon of madness in Russian culture through literature and film. The main focus will be on the psychological literature of the 19th Century, including the themurder novels of Dostoevsky, as well as studies of madness by Lermontov, Gogol, Chekhov,and others. This trend in Russian literature will be related to pathological features of Russianhistory (Tsarism, Totalitarianism) to find underlying reasons why these features are soprevalent in the Russian arts. Films will include Tsar, concerning Ivan the Terrible, and BurntBy the Sun, a chronicle of the Stalinist terror.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 340 - The Russian Avant-Garde and Soviet Modernism Two of the most explosively important geo-political events of modernity were World War I and the Russian Revolution(s) of 1917. This course investigates the theories and practice of theRussian Avant-Garde in the visual arts, literature, industrial design and architecture in relationto parallel international developments during the Revolutionary period through the rise of Stalin 238in the early 1930s. Topics include: fragmentation and shifts in artistic perception of time, space and reality; responses to advances in science, technology and industry; constructivist design,architecture and theater; montage and cinema; consumerism and artist collectives,manifesti, and the relationship of theory and ideology; cultural imports from Europe andAmerica.

Our department offers a broad diversity of courses and approaches covering everytime period, and cultures from all over the globe. Students will become familiar with intellectual,social, political, comparative and oral history, and may select from a wide spectrum of coursesincluding such geographical areas as Latin America, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, theUnited States, and such topical areas as Women's History, the History of Science andMedicine, revolution and history in film. The faculty recognizes that students will develop theirown perspectives on the material presented, and welcomes close interaction with motivatedand involved majors. History is, after all, an exciting kind of detective work, finding and puttingtogether the pieces of the puzzle to enhance our understanding of the past, but also of thepresent, and perhaps even the future. Some history majors go on to further studies in the field,but because of their wide exposure to various times and cultures, they are well prepared foralmost any career. Besides providing a background for anyone interested in a truly liberaleducation, History helps prepare students for the fields of law, business, foreign service,librarianship, museum work, historic preservation, journalism, environmental studies, andteaching from primary and secondary through university levels. Requirements MAJOR: The History major consists of a minimum of forty units, or ten four-unit courses. This includes two required courses (300 History Colloquium and 490 Senior Seminar) and threesurveys from different geographical areas (United States, Latin America, Asia, Europe,Africa/Middle East). Survey courses (the 100 series and some of the 200 series) cover a broadchronological time frame. Three of the remaining five classes should be additional upperdivision courses (in the 300 and 400 series). At least one course must deal with the pre-modern period. Students thus have the opportunity to sample a breadth of fields and periods.Of the ten required courses, at least seven must be taken in the History department, and nomore than three will be accepted from other departments or institutions (see discussion ofacceptable courses from other departments below). Students with AP scores of 4 or 5 receive academic credit, but still need to take the requisite 10 courses for the History major. They may, however, be excused from one surveyrequirement, taking 2 rather than 3 area surveys, although we discourage this, believing as wedo that our department courses are far more challenging and sophisticated than even the besthigh school AP class. Students must have a grade of B- or better on the 15-page paper in History 300. ACCEPTABLE COURSES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS: The department occasionally accepts for history credit courses from such other departments as American Studies, Art History and the Visual Arts, Critical Theory - Social Justice, Diplomacy and World Affairs,English and Comparative Literary Studies, Philosophy, and Politics. These decisions are made 244on an individual basis in discussion with the student's advisor and/or the department chair. Courses that may be counted toward the major without petition are: American Studies 272,280, 290, 295, and 390; ECLS 341. No more than three courses from other departments ortransfer courses from other institutions (including study abroad courses) will be countedtowards the History major. MINOR: Five courses (20 units) in History from at least two areas, including History 300. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in History satisfy the final component of Occidental's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing History 300. Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time of declaring themajor. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Students meet their comprehensive requirement by taking History 490 in the fall semester of their senior year and writing for that course a 25-page paper that involves research and analysis of primary and secondary sources. They arerequired to turn in a 5-page prospectus of their project and attend several meetings in thespring of their junior year to prepare for History 490. Papers may concentrate on ageographical area or take a topical approach, such as History of Science and Medicine;Women's History; or Revolutions. HONORS: Students with sufficiently high GPA (3.25) overall can write an honors thesis. Senior history majors pursuing honors will take the Senior Seminar in the fall and, if invited by the Senior Seminar instructors in consultation with thesis advisors, will extend their thesis work inthe spring Honors Seminar. The honors thesis is a 40-page paper, which demonstratesexcellence in historical research, writing, and analysis, written under the supervision of theHonors Seminar instructor, the thesis advisor, and a third faculty reader. Students planning totry for honors must make known their intentions in a written proposal early spring semester oftheir junior year. See the Honors Program for additional information. DISTINCTION: Students are eligible for distinction if they receive an A or A- on their paper for History 490.AWARDS: The R. Lee Culp Prize is awarded annually to a senior for the most outstanding senior thesis. The Edith Culp Prize is awarded annually for the best term paper or junior seminar paper. The Diana Culp Bork Prize is awarded annually for outstanding service to thedepartment.

Open to majors and minorsonly, or may enroll with instructor's approval. The Fascist Revolution: Politics, Culture, and Soc. This History 300/ Junior Seminar closely studies the period known as Fascist Italy (1922 to 1945). Through a close analysis of the politics, culture, and society of Italy under Fascistdictatorship, we study the causes, character, and ramification of the Italian abandonment ofdemocracy in the wake of World War I. Because it is a History 300 historiographic seminar, weexamine the central debates of the field, such as whether Mussolini ruled primarily throughcoercion or consent, the extent of Fascist race ideology, and whether the regime was \"modern\"or \"backward-looking.\" Other major themes include Fascist cultural modernism, gender andFascism, and the Italian road to empire and World War II. This course uses primary sources,such as translated documents, memoirs, and diaries, as well as contemporary historicalanalyses. Prerequisite: Majors and minors only, or with Instructor Permission Writing World History This junior seminar investigates various approaches to writing world history. The course is designed to help history majors understand historiography and historical criticism. By studyingrecent approaches to world history, students will learn how historical debate shapes the writingof history, how historians approach and critique each other's work, and how different styles ofhistorical research and writing have developed over time. Open to majors and minors only, ormay enroll with permission of instructor.

Prerequisite: HIST 490 United States 101 - United States Culture and Society This course is an introduction to early North American/U.S. history reaching from colonization to the Civil War. Of particular interest in this course will be the theme of cross-culturalinteractions in the midst of transforming economies, an expanding nation, and unequal powerrelations. We will combine a broad introduction to early American history with an in-depth lookat five case studies of individuals and communities encountering each other across borders ofnation, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, and class. Each case study offers a unique perspectiveon the question of how broad economic structures of colonization, slavery, and the marketrevolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers, captives and captors,slaves and slaveholders, northerners and southerners. Ultimately, these case studiesencourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty, equality, and democracy, which haveformed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history. Within the context of thesebroad, sweeping themes we will look closely at primary historical documents, produced by menand women of their time period and we will read carefully the arguments of historians in ourown time.

A secondmajor concern will be to study women in the context of the historical developments of theirtime; reform movements, westward migration, industrialization and urbanization, will beexamined in light of their impact on women's experiences and values. The course will alsoconsider a number of themes, including popular images of women, women and sexuality,women and the family, women and work, women as consumers, and women as reformers.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 208 - Immigrants in America, 1492 to the Present What does it mean to say that America is a \"nation of immigrants?\" This course explores the creation of America through migrations from five continents over several centuries. Topicsinclude the legal and political foundations of U.S. citizenship, the creation of the U.S.-Mexicoborder, the origins of illegal immigration, ethnic and racial identity, state power, resistance,popular culture, social movements, and the importance of gender and sexuality in shapingimmigration policy and its enforcement, as well as immigrants' experiences in America.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES DIVERSITY and UNITED STATES 277 - Women and Community Health This course explores the history of women as promoters of community health in the diverse cultures of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States. Although women have nottraditionally held power in mainstream biomedical occupations and institutions, women havenevertheless been critical to health and healing in local communities as caregivers, activists,and even scapegoats for disease. Furthermore, women's role in community health has beenheavily shaped by gendered constructions of the body, disease, and wellbeing. Thus, while thefocus of the course is on the social history of women's health and healing, the theoreticalframework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender, race, class, and 260sexuality shape the women's relationship to community health as both caregivers and health- seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time, space, andracial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History. Themes include: spirituality and healing; work andhealth; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 295 - Topics in American History American Frontiers The Frontier is backcountry, ghost town, cowboys and Indians, prairie ?and homesteaders, ranchers and sodbusters. It is more than these ?familiar images, though: the American Frontieris the encounter of the ?Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant, from Europe,Asia, ?and Africa - with the rest of the world, a historical development that ?began in 1492 andis still going on today. Although this is a ?transnational phenomenon, this course is primarilyconcerned with the ?Frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in?California, viewing it simultaneously as place, process, and myth. In ?this course, we will alsobe doing our own original research in the? Occidental Library's John Lloyd Butler SpecialCollections on ?Railroading, so students will have a chance to make their own mark ?upon theAmerican Frontier.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Modern America: US History 1945 to Present In this course we will examine the emergence of the U.S. as a world power, along with the challenges and realignments that ensued: the persistence and then erosion of the New Dealorder, with its replacement by a politics more skeptical of a welfare system; the triumph ofconsumer culture; the growth of social diversity, both as an ideal and a reality; and the rolesplayed by social movements, especially the civil rights movement, the women's movement,and the conservative movement. We will use a combination of primary and secondary sourcesas texts and students in addition will view a number of films from the era. Prerequisite: 1course in historyCORE REQIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY U.S. Intellectual History Since 1865 This course examines major themes in the history of thought and culture in the United States since the late nineteenth century. Among other topics, we will consider the modern liberal-progressive tradition and its radical and conservative critics; the uneasy status of religion in asecular intellectual culture; cultural radicalism and feminism; consumer culture and itsinterpreters; the implications of American ethno-racial pluralism for national identity; theresponses of intellectuals to hot and cold wars, the Great Depression, and the upheavals of the1960s. In addition, course readings and lectures will introduce students to ongoing debatesabout the public role and responsibilities of intellectuals as a distinct social group. Americanintellectuals have long struggled to define their vocation as inquirers and critics. In the process,they have sought to understand how that vocation might best respond to the demands of abroader public sphere. Their efforts to balance intellectual integrity with civic engagementprovide an opportunity to reflect on your own experiences as students and interpreters of theUnited States and its culture.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Women and American Politics A little under one hundred years ago, American women were denied the vote. Now women make up 53 percent of the electorate, women hold a record 261proportion of Senate and House seats, and the nation has nearly elected a woman president. The change is meaningful, yet the U.S. still ranks just 55th on the World Economic Forum'sindex of women's empowerment. This course will examine the history of women in Americanpolitics from 1920 to the present, with a focus on 1960 to today. Topics will include: the politicsof sexual revolution, women in elections as candidates and voters, liberal and conservativewomen's movements, women and gender in the political parties, feminism, the intersection ofrace, class, and gender in U.S. national politics, and public opinion on women's issues. Mostclass sessions will include film, guest speakers, or group projects.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Sport and Society in the Americas Organized sport offers a literal and figurative arena in which national, racial, and gendered borders are often reinforced or undone. This courseexplores the ways sports constitute and disrupt social understandings of nation, race, gender,and sexuality within specific national contexts. Students will examine the cultural impact of arange of national pastimes across the Americas: from soccer in Argentina to baseball in Cuba,from cricket in Trinidad to college football in the United States. Students will be encouraged toexamine these case studies in ways that move beyond comparative nation-based approachesto the study of sports and nation and instead analyze the ways sports operate as transnationalphenomena. Students will also consider the impact of sports \"beyond the playing field,\"including the political economy of stadium construction, the representation of sport in film, andthe politics surrounding the persistence of Native American mascots in college andprofessional sports in the United States. Course materials include works by historians,geographers, social theorists and journalists who have also been key contributors to theburgeoning field of sports studies.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTIONS and INTERCULTURAL Afro-America This course examines the historical experiences of people of African descent in the Americas from slavery to the present. The guiding questions of this course are: What is Afro-America?Where is it? How can we write the histories of African descended peoples in the regionthroughout the region? Can the histories of Africans and their descendants be contained withinthe confines of \"nation\"? Are there alternative frameworks (transnational and/or Diasporic) thatcan better enhance our understanding of these histories? While the course will begin in theslavery era, most of our attention will focus on the histories of Africans and their descendantsafter emancipation. Topics we will explore include: the particularities of slavery in theAmericas, the Haitian Revolution and its impact on articulations of race and nation in theregion, the emergence of racial segregation (legalized and informal), debates on \"racialdemocracy,\" the relationship between gender, race, and empire, and recent attempts to writeAfro-American histories from \"transnational\" and \"diaspora\" perspectives. While historianshave written most of the work we will read in this course, we will also engage the works ofanthropologists and sociologists who have also been key contributors to this scholarship.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: GLOBAL CONNECTIONS and INTERCULTURAL 304 - The American Revolution, 1760-1815 This course considers the American Revolution as a broad social transformation whose origins preceded the conflict over British taxation and whose consequences stretched beyond theratification of the Constitution. We will explore the cultural and social origins of Americanindependence and recognize the role of Native Americans and enslaved Africans in shapingthe political and military conflict. The course will devote significant attention to the early 262republic and the effort of diverse Americans to find a meaningful freedom in the new nation. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES PRE-1800 306 - The Emergence of Modern America: the United States 1919-1945 This course will cover the domestic history of the U.S. from 1919 to 1945 and the social, cultural, and political changes accompanying America's evolution into a modern society.Themes include: developments in work, leisure, and consumption; impact of depression andwar on the organization of the public and private sectors; persistence of traditional values suchas individualism and the success ethos in shaping response to change; and the diversity ofAmerica's people and American experience.

CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 309 - Slavery in the Antebellum South This course examines the southern region of the antebellum United States as a \"slave society\", that is, a society in which slavery was central to the region's economy and a powerfulslaveholding minority held the reigns of political power. We will examine the rise of a \"peculiar\"institution of southern slavery and the impact of chattel slavery on southern households,political institutions, and cultural practices. How did the institution of slavery shape the lives ofsoutherners differently depending on race, class, gender, and geography? In what ways didthe centrality of an institutionalized system of human property shape the social relations andlived experiences of enslaved African Americans, common whites, slaveholding planters, andNative Americans of the South? How did these groups of Southerners draw upon religion,violence, and ideologies of sex and race both to challenge and reinforce the southern socialorder? Finally, what did the South as a region come to mean to other antebellum Americans assectional conflicts heightened in the 1850s? Students will explore the social and cultural historyof the antebellum South through primary documents, first-person narratives, film, fiction, music,and extensive secondary scholarship.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 390 - Research Seminar in History History of Consumer Culture in the US 1880-1980 The consumption of goods, services, and experiences has been an important element in the history of the United States, from the seventeenth century to the present. However, the centurybeginning in 1880 transformed the nation into a modern consumer society. This researchseminar provides a lens through which to explore such issues as the impact of mass media on 263society; the gendered, racial, ethnic, and class issues that shape the experience of consumption; the role of the United States in the global development of modern consumption;and the ways in which the intersections of consumption, production, and politics shaped thenation. This seminar has two focal points. First, reading contemporary historical scholarshipprovides both models for students' own research and ways of understanding issues such asthe power relationships that undergird a consumer society and the moral challengesconsumption has posed. Second, as the semester proceeds, attention will increasingly turn! tooriginal research projects that draw on the widest variety of sources, such as visual culture,novels, newspapers and magazines, and the literature of social protest. What is theintellectual justification of the course? This course examines the rise and significance ofconsumer culture in the U.S. It will introduce students to important secondary works onconsumer culture in the U.S. and will teach research methods and skills. Prerequisite: Satsifactory completion of at least one History course. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 395 - Special Topics in American History Reading and Writing Los Angeles. Major urban centers such as Los Angeles have always been evocative locations for cultural representation. The densely packed topographies, rich and diverse social interactions, and complex hierarchies of power and influence situated inthese exemplary places lend them an air of excitement and mystery. These same factors thatinspire intriguing urban literature, film, and journalism also make cities exemplary subjects forhistorical investigation. In this course, we will employ a strategy of documentary archaeology toreconstruct the relations of power, race, gender, and ethnicity embedded in the historicallandscapes of Los Angeles during the twentieth century. Through archival research (inOccidental College's Special Collections and elsewhere), close reading of cultural artifacts, andcareful exploration of scholarly works, we will seek to uncover something of the fabric ofeveryday social history in the noir megalopolis. Life in the Mosaic: 160 Years of Jews in Los Angeles. The story of Jews in Los Angeles is both familiar and unique. Familiar because it is a story of the growth of Los Angeles and the mobility of its citizens. Unique because Jews have been at both the center and the margins ofinfluence in the political, social, and cultural movements that have created contemporary LosAngeles. This course explores, from the beginning of the American era to the present day, thepivotal roles Jews have played in the shaping of Los Angeles, and the reshaping of Jewishidentities, communities, and perspectives by the opportunities and challenges found in LosAngeles. By examining how Jews have negotiated, and continue to negotiate, the complexitiesof life in Los Angeles, the course offers students an opportunity to consider the processes ofsocial incorporation, marginalization, and fragmentation against the backdrop of urbandevelopment. Using the perspective of one of the many diverse groups that have transformedthe region, it anchors historical change in a comprehensible narrative. By considering how theplace and myth called Los Angeles has shaped Jewish identities, the course offers students anoccasion to reflect on their own notions of self-identity, community, and society in the twenty-first century. The course themes and topics are derived from an exhibition to be mounted at theAutry National Center in Spring 2013. Through course assignments and related activities,students will be able to contribute to the development of the exhibition with their originalresearch, as research and editorial interns, and through analytical critiques of various elementsof the exhibition. The combination of class and field work will allow students to acquireexperience in historical research, interpretation, and public presentation.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 264The US Since 1945. This readings course will focus on the cultural, social, and political dimensions of the history of the United States, from 1945 to the present. Among the topics under consideration will be race, ethnicity, gender, consumer culture, religion, socialmovements, as well as the intersection between politics, culture, and globalization. The textsstudies will be major books by historians, political scientists, sociologists, and non-fictionauthors. Prerequisite: One History course CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY California Since 1940. California Since 1940 Before World War II, California was in many ways an agricultural settler society, far removed from the global currents, which propelled it toworld prominence in previous centuries. But the war transformed the Golden State into anindustrial powerhouse and brought dramatic social changes, which would define the nationthroughout the twentieth century. In this class, we begin with the Depression and War towitness the birth of a new, noir California, particularly in Los Angeles, and trace the intersectionof military/technological expertise and leisure culture as it produced the counterculture,Internet, and personal computer revolutions that would once again place California at thecenter of the world. Prerequisite: One history course CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY The Arts and Public Life in Modern America An exploration of the ways in which the arts have influenced public life in the United States since the early 20th century and have, in turn, been shaped by competing visions of democratic citizenship. In addition to examining the public interventions of artists, we will study the history of institutions ranging from museums and government cultural agencies to local community arts groups. The course combines seminar meetings with visits to area sites and organizations. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY Transportation and Place in American History. How have our ways of moving through the world affected our understandings of familiar spaces around us? Can we think of transportation technology as a form of mass media that has changed over time, thus altering perceptions ofeven the most familiar landscapes? In this course, we will explore several historical modes ofperceiving and navigating the landscapes of American cities, and particularly greater LosAngeles, ranging from the pedestrian city to the metropolis of railroads and streetcars(including the famous Pacific Electric system) to the sprawling megalopolis of automobiles andfreeways. We might even speculate what a transit and pedestrian Los Angeles of the futuremight look like - will it be a return to the past, or betoken new ways of understanding, andorganizing, our everyday urban spaces? Central to this exploration will be extensive researchin the college's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections archives on railroads and their historyand on Southern California in the twentieth century. In this process, students will carry outoriginal archival research, culminating in a significant paper reflecting both their own researchdiscoveries in the archives as well as their new perspectives on American urbanism inSouthern California and elsewhere.

Writing well is not a skill-set to bemastered, but an intricate interaction of cognitive and rhetorical processes performed for avariety of purposes, in multiple circumstances, and for diverse audiences. This minor allowsstudents to practice these processes in a range of writing situations, and exposes students tocomparative approaches to modes of writing: prose, creative nonfiction, playwriting, poetry,journalism, screenwriting, professional writing, and multimedia. The interdisciplinary approach of this minor helps students develop strong writing skills, techniques, and practices through varied pedagogical styles and methods. A main benefit ofthis minor is that students will have opportunities to learn from faculty in different disciplines,gaining knowledge of those disciplines while writing in various genres. These courses providea strong writing foundation for students interested in any number of academic and careerfields. Requirements The Interdisciplinary Writing minor is a five-course (5) program consisting of one (1) required200-level core class and four (4) electives, described as follows.

Courses Calculus Calculus differs in some respects from the traditional courses offered at some secondary schools and most other colleges or universities. Occidental's program is based on scientificmodeling, makes regular use of computers, and requires interpretation as well as computation.A variety of courses comprise this program, accommodating different levels of preparation. Thecore content is described below as Calculus 1 and 2. Actual courses suited to different levelsof preparation are listed under each description. Calculus 1: Scientific Modeling and Differential Calculus Many mathematical models in the natural and social sciences take the form of systems of differential equations. This introduction to the calculus is organized around the constructionand analysis of these models, focusing on the mathematical questions they raise. Models aredrawn from biology, economics, and physics. The important elementary functions of analysisarise as solutions of these models in special cases. The mathematical theme of the course is local linearity. Topics include the definition of the derivative, rules for computing derivatives, Euler's Method, Newton's Method, Taylorpolynomials, error analysis, optimization, and an introduction to the differential calculus of 286functions of two variables. CALCULUS 2: Scientific Modeling and Integral Calculus This course continues the study of the calculus through scientific modeling. While Calculus 1 is concerned with local changes in a function, Calculus 2 focuses on accumulated changes.Models solved by accumulation functions lead to the definition of the integral and theFundamental Theorem of Calculus. Additional topics include numerical and analytic techniques of integration, trigonometric functions and dynamical systems modeling periodic or quasiperiodic phenomena, localapproximation of functions by Taylor polynomials and Taylor series, and approximation ofperiodic functions on an interval by trigonometric polynomials and Fourier series. 108 - Unified Precalculus and Calculus 1-A The first of a two course sequence enriching the material in Calculus 1 with additional study of elementary functions, algebra, trigonometry, graphing, and mathematical expression.

Students majoring in music develop anintegrated understanding of music as creative work, as cultural and historical expression, andas performance. Through its curriculum, recitals, lectures, master classes, residencies, andother public events, the Music department leads the musical discourse that enriches Collegeand community life. Music majors and minors develop their craft in a rigorous analytical study of music from the world's musical traditions, which they apply to their own artistic expression as they engage inspecific studies in composition, performance, conducting, music theory, and music history. Inaddition to upper-division courses requiring a reading knowledge of standard music notation,the Music department also offers a wide array of special topics courses in subjects rangingfrom popular music and jazz to opera, choral music and art song, instrumental music, music forfilm, and music in world cultures. Classroom and private studies are coordinated withopportunities to attend live concerts by the world-class musical artists who perform on campusand elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. Students study, practice, and perform in Booth MusicHall and Thorne Hall, with ready access to practice rooms, large and small performance halls,an electronic music studio, and a music library of scores, recordings, and computers withmusicianship and notation programs. The music major is designed to enable students to enter into music-related professions. Alumni have become successful in opera, musical theater, professional choruses and orchestras, incareers as concert artists, and as composers and arrangers for films, television, and theater.Many have become music teachers in private studios or at the elementary, middle and highschool, or college and university level. Still others have become involved in related professionssuch as arts management, sound engineering, music editing, and publishing.

These skills are intrinsically valuable throughout one's life andapply to a wide variety of professions, including law, medicine, education, journalism, business,public policy, and government. In addition, the methods and skills developed in a philosophicaleducation aim to provide students with the intellectual grounds for reflecting on their beliefs, torecognize the strengths and weaknesses of alterative beliefs, and to understand howphilosophical ideas have shaped their culture and history. Studying philosophy will helpstudents develop these intellectual grounds. In both these respects, the mission of philosophypromotes responsible citizenship, social and economic justice, and the recognition of andrespect for differences among groups and between individuals. Requirements MAJOR: Ten courses (40 units) in philosophy are required for the major, including Philosophy 210; Philosophy 225; Philosophy 230; six additional courses in philosophy, three of which areupper division (in the 300-series); Philosophy 490. Philosophy 101 can be counted toward thesix additional courses in philosophy, but is not a required course. The three upper division courses must meet the following distribution requirements: one must concentrate on the history of philosophy (300; 305; 310), one on moral and political philosophy(300; 310; 330; 340; 345; 365; 370; 375; can fulfill two distribution requirements. Forexample, Philosophy 305 can count both toward the history of philosophy and metaphysicsand epistemology; and Philosophy 300 and Philosophy 310 can count both toward the historyof philosophy and moral and political philosophy. The flexibility of the major allows students to pursue the study of philosophy broadly, or to tailor a course of study to their philosophical interests. The following course clusters are intended asguides for students interested in concentrating their studies toward a specific philosophicalinterest. These suggestions should supplement, rather than replace, significant and frequentdiscussion with a faculty adviser concerning designing and executing a coherent plan of studywithin the major.

Students should familiarize themselves with the departmental requirement at the time ofdeclaring the major. See the Writing Program and consult the department chair for additionalinformation. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: Graduating seniors in philosophy write one long essay, 318the \"state of thought\" essay, to satisfy their comprehensives requirement. This essay, approximately 30 pages long, is on a topic of their choice and is written with the advice andassistance of two faculty advisers. Seniors begin work on this essay in the Senior Seminar (Philosophy 490) in the fall semester. In this class, which is organized by a faculty member, seniors focus on writing a preliminary20-page essay that provides a broad survey of the \"state of thought\" on their chosen topic,along with a discussion of the important and differing approaches taken by the keyphilosophers who have written on their topic. With satisfactory completion of the preliminaryessay, students receive a grade of CIP (course in progress) at the end of the fall semester. Although there is no class associated with the philosophy comprehensives in the spring semester, seniors continue to work on their \"state of thought\" essays, with the assistance ofthe instructor for Philosophy 490. In the spring semester seniors focus on assessing thearguments that have been brought to bear on their topic, and on developing their owncontributions to the topic. Once essays are complete, seniors present their work orally to thecampus community. With satisfactory completion of their essays and oral presentations in the spring semester, the fall semester CIP grade is changed to a letter grade. The letter grade is based on the quality oftheir essays, the quality of their contributions to the seminar discussions in Philosophy 490,and the quality of their oral presentations in the spring. Final grades will be determined by thephilosophy faculty as a whole. MINOR (updated 12/5/11): Five courses (20 units) in Philosophy, including Philosophy 225. At least one course must be an upper division course (in the 300 series). Students who wish to craft a narrowly focused course of study for the minor should consult a philosophy facultyadviser and the concentration guides above (listed under \"Philosophy Major\"). INTERDEPARTMENTAL MAJOR IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE: See Cognitive Science. GRADUATE STUDY IN PHILOSOPHY: Students interested in pursuing graduate study in philosophy should contact a faculty adviser as early as possible for assistance crafting an appropriate course of study both in philosophy and relevant cognate fields. HONORS: There is no special class associated with honors. Honors in philosophy is awarded in recognition of excellence in work done for the senior essay, and will be determined by the philosophy faculty as a whole once final versions of the senior essays have been submitted.Seniors need a 3.3 GPA in philosophy and a 3.25 GPA overall to be considered forDepartmental honors. See the Honors Program and consult the department chair for furtherdetails. Courses 101 - Introduction to Philosophy An exploration of some of the main issues in philosophy. Philosophical inquiry is anexamination of the concepts we use to make sense of our world, our selves, and ourpredicament. Philosophical method employs the imagination to put those concepts understress, by seeking to understand how we would employ those concepts in non-actual 319situations. Rod's Serling's classic television series The Twilight Zone (1959 - 1964) will serve as the catalyst to our imaginations and our shared experience as we take up the practice ofphilosophy.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 205 - Introduction to Ancient Thought An examination of the problems in moral and political philosophy created by, and resultingfrom, the historical events surrounding Athens in the 5th Century B.C. The course will examinehistorical writings (Herodotus, Thucydides), Greek tragedy, Pre-Socratic thought and Plato,and developments in art, with as much reference as possible to their social and economiccontexts.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 210 - Historical Introduction to Philosophy We will address some of the fundamental issues in epistemology and metaphysics whilereading selections from the works of some important philosophers throughout history. Amongthe issues addressed will be the existence of the external world, the relation between themental and the physical, and the foundation of our knowledge of the future. Philosopherscovered will include Berkeley, Descartes, Hume, and Kant.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 225 - Formal Logic We will study the formal properties of arguments and sets of statements. This will involvelearning two formal languages, the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus. Withinthese languages we will formalize the notions of validity, soundness, and consistency, andshow how these properties can be tested.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 230 - Introduction to Ethics This course will address some fundamental questions in ethics, such as: What is the best lifefor a human being? Should I be good? Can I be good? Is morality objective, subjective, orrelative to one's society? Is there any relation between ethics and religion? What are ourobligations to others, both friends and strangers? What are our obligations to non-humananimals? We will read both classical and contemporary writings in ethics.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL COMNNECTIONS 235 - Feminism and Philosophy A critical analysis of contemporary feminist theories and their philosophical roots. Topics fordiscussion will include: equality, respect, meaningful work, parenting, friendship, sexualrelations, abortion, rape, pornography, and prostitution.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 240 - Philosophy of Race 320This course will philosophically examine the concept of race and the way race informs identity. Topics include the reality of race, the origins and nature of the concept, and the extent to whichrace does and should impact our social and personal identities.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 250 - Bioethics This course is an introduction to the methods of ethics developed for addressing moral issuesin the practice of health care and research. Methods addressed will include: professionalethics (practice standards and professional norms), casuistry, the principles of biomedicalethics, applied normative theory, feminist bioethics, and narrative ethics. We will use thesemethods to address a host of topics of concern to those participating in health care institutions,either (directly) as providers or (somewhat less directly) as policy makers. Given in alternateyears. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 255 - Environmental Ethics This course will examine the nature of environmental values and their role in decisions andpublic policies concerning environmental protection. Some of the questions we will addressinclude: What is the relation between the environment and human health and well-being? Arethere reasons other than human health and well-being for protecting the environment? How dowe compare environmental values against other values in making reasonable decisions? Whatare the ethical issues involved in cost-benefit analysis? What are our duties to futuregenerations and non-human animals?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 285 - Paradoxes Paradoxes and their resolution have played a significant role in the development of philosophy;they still have an influence on philosophy today. While Zeno's paradoxes of motion where firstposed about 2000 years ago there is still not a consensus about what to say about them.Semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox and the paradoxes of vagueness revealproblems with everyday concepts such as truth and implication. Supertasks reveal problemswith our understanding of infinity. What to say about these problems, what they show us abouthow to understand space, time, infinity, truth and implication, for example, are some of theissues we will discuss in this class. We will examine various paradoxes, puzzles, andpurported paradoxes, and discuss different proposed resolutions to them.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 290 - Art: Form, Meaning, Value This course will explore foundational questions in the philosophy of art: What is art? Is there aquality, or feature, or function that all works of art share? How does art get its meaning? Doesthe artist or the viewer (or both, or neither) determine the meaning of an artwork? (Why) do wevalue the authenticity or originality of an artwork? What determines whether something is agood work of art? Can art make us better (or worse) people? Can good works of art havemorally bad properties? How can we be moved by fictions (that is, how can we fear themonsters of horror films)? 321CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL ? FINE ARTS 300 - Topics in Classical Philosophy An examination of the moral and political philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Questions for discussion will include: how should I live and what sort of person should I be?What is the nature of happiness? Can I be happy and also morally vicious? Do I have anygood reason to act in the interests of others when they conflict with my own interests? What isthe nature of justice and the just state? How do states affect our desires and aims? Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE PRE-1800 305 - Topics in Modern Philosophy A detailed examination of some central philosophical texts from the 17th and 18th centuries. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE and REGIONAL FOCUS 310 - Hobbes to Kant An examination of four great figures in Western moral and political philosophy of the 17th and18th centuries: Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Topics to bediscussed include: the basis of political obligation, the nature of the just state, the basis ofhuman rights and the right to property, the nature of human reason and its relation to passion,and the foundation of moral obligation. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 325 - Metalogic A survey of results in the metatheory of first order logic, including consistency, completeness,decidability, and undecidability. Prerequisite: Philosophy 225, Mathematics 210, or permission of instructor. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: MATH/SCI 330 - Globalization and Justice This course examines various theories of justice in international relations and evaluates them according to a range of practical problems facing globalization. Typically, we shall start byexploring the tension between universal values and cultural relativism, which underlies much ofthe theory and practice of international relations. We will then examine this tension in a numberof controversies concerning globalization, including war and peace, international politicaleconomy and distributive justice, environmental issues, human rights, and terrorism.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 333 - Transnational Justice When we discuss, study and call for 'justice' we often do so in the context of (more or less)stable political institutions. In the contemporary global community we frequently face unstableor non-existent political institutions of the kind assumed in a great deal of our political theory.These transitional contexts often exist in the aftermath of large-scale human rights abuses 322(such as genocide, apartheid and other crimes against humanity). This raises an important question: what constitutes justice in these transitional contexts? This course explores thisfoundational question, through more particular topics, such as: the nature and value of truthand reconciliation commissions, reparations, restorative justice, the normative foundations ofinternational criminal law, and the nature of evil and atrocity.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 340 - Philosophy of Law The course covers both analytical and normative jurisprudence and provides students with acomprehensive foundation for study of the law. Analytical jurisprudence examines the natureand justification of the law including alternative conceptions like natural law theory, positivism,critical legal studies, and law and economics. In addition, the course covers the problem oflegal interpretation and the role of judicial review in constitutional democracies. Normativejurisprudence concerns the ethical issues raised by the law including freedom of expressionand hate speech, freedom of religion and the separation of church and state, civil liberties andrights, theories of punishment and the death penalty, and equal protection doctrine.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 345 - Contemporary Moral Philosophy: Authenticity, Identity, and Freedom This course focuses on some issues in moral philosophy that arise for us as reflective andresponsible citizens in a multicultural world. Topics for discussion will include: to what extentam I free, and to what extent am I the product of circumstances beyond my control? What isthe nature of moral agency and moral responsibility? How can I live authentically and establishmy own identity? How ought I to relate to the majority and minority cultures that surround meand of which I may be a part?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 350 - Contemporary Classics in Political Philosophy: Justice, Liberty, andEquality This course focuses on John Rawls's Theory of Justice , arguably the greatest work in political philosophy since the 19th century. Attention will also be given to two important, but differing,responses to Rawls, in the work of Robert Nozick and Susan Okin. Topics for discussion willinclude: what is the nature of the just state? Can a just state guarantee both the liberty of itscitizens and their equality? Which economic distributions are just? Is there a right to property,and if so what is its basis? What is the best life for human beings, and how far can a just statego in providing that life for its citizens?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 355 - Philosophy of Space and Time The course will cover such topics as whether space and time exist, how we know what thegeometry of space and time is, whether any sense can be made of the claim that time has adirection, and the \"paradoxes\" of time travel. We will examine these questions in the context ofboth pre-relativistic and relativistic theories. The readings will range from historical figures,such as Newton, Leibniz and Mach, to contemporary work by both philosophers and physicists,including Hawking, Thorne and Sklar. This course does not require previous exposure to 323Special or General Relativity and will not require as a prerequisite technical skills that go beyond high school mathematics and physics, but the student is expected to be comfortablewith algebraic and geometric reasoning.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 360 - Philosophy of Mind A philosophical treatment of consciousness (including sensation, mental imagery, andemotion) and intentionality (including mental representation and \"aboutness\"). Questions to beasked include: \"Is it possible to construct a computer which feels pain?\" \"What is the status ofour folk psychological concepts \"Is intentionality the mark of themental?\" and \"What is the relation between thought and language?\" Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 365 - Philosophy of Science We will look at a number of episodes in the history of science. Among the issues that will beaddressed will be the following: When should we consider evidence as confirming a theory?What considerations should we use to decide between competing theories? Should we viewour best theories as true or merely empirically adequate? Can there be a logic of scientificdiscovery? We will read works by philosophers and scientists including van Fraassen,Reichenbach, Feyerabend, Newton, and Galileo.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 370 - Philosophy of Language We will examine a number of recently proposed accounts of meaning, truth, and reference.Issues that will come up will be whether there could be a private language, what the role ofmental content is, how we should understand metaphor, and whether truth is a redundantnotion. Philosophers covered include Frege, Russell, Tarski, Quine, Putnam, Kripke, andSearle. Given in alternate years. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL and GLOBAL CONNECTIONS 375 - Theory of Knowledge This course will examine: (1) the theories of knowledge of such philosophers as Price, Russell,and Chisholm (\"Foundationalists\"), (2) some of their critics, such as Sellars and Quine, and (3)recent work in naturalized epistemology.CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 380 - Wittgenstein Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is a central figure in the two most important philosophicaltraditions of the twentieth century: First, the attempt early in the century to characterizelanguage, thought and the world in terms of the newly available formalism of modern logic, andsecond, the attempt to show that any such formalization will fail to do justice to the richcomplexity of language as a form of life, a form inseparable from the social and historicalcontext from which it springs. We will examine two principal works, the Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations . There will also be some treatment of the 324historical and philosophical context of Wittgenstein's work and life. CORE REQUIREMENT MET: EUROPE 385 - Metaphysics The course will focus on contemporary readings that raise some of the most fundamentalissues in metaphysics. The following questions are among those that will be addressed: Canwe make sense of the idea that we are free agents? Can we understand the concept ofcausation? Is there a compelling argument for the existence of God? Is there any sense to bemade of the claim that some claims are true by necessity while others are only contingentlytrue? Are there true mathematical claims?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 397 - Independent Study in Philosophy Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 2 or 4 units 490 - Senior Seminar in Philosophy Prerequisite: senior standing in philosophy. Faculty Regular Faculty Marcia Homiak Professor, Philosophy A.B., Mount Holyoke College; Ph.D., Harvard University Carolyn Brighouse Associate Professor, Cognitive Science, Philosophy B.A., University of Liverpool; M.A., Ph.D., University of Southern California Clair Morrissey Assistant Professor, Philosophy B.A., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; M.A., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Ph.D.,University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Saul Traiger Professor, Cognitive Science, Philosophy B.A., State University of New York, Binghamton M.A., Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh On Special Appointment Dylan Sabo Adjunct Assistant Professor, Philosophy Ph.D., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 325Physics The Physics department provides an education in the fundamental processes of the physical world with thorough study in both the classroom and laboratory. After completion of theprogram, a physics student will have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills in additionto ample hands-on laboratory experience. The Physics major is excellent preparation forprofessional or graduate work in physics, engineering, and related fields. In addition, a physicsmajor finds that he or she is an attractive applicant for medical, business, or law school, as wellas having an excellent foundation for science teaching. In addition to the full spectrum of undergraduate coursework, the department offers many opportunities to participate in research projects both on and off campus. Qualified studentsmay begin research projects as early as their first year. Current research activities in thedepartment include experimental investigations in Astrophysics, Condensed Matter Physics,Plasma Physics, and Materials Science, theoretical investigations in Cosmology and ParticlePhysics, and theoretical and numerical investigations in complex systems. Departmentalresources include well-equipped research and instructional laboratories, as well as laboratoryspace for qualified students to carry out independent investigations of their own. Manystudents have also participated in projects at nearby institutions such as the California Instituteof Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Students who wish to do advanced work in physics or engineering should complete the introductory physics sequence (Physics 106, 110, 120) as early as possible. These coursesprovide a foundation in both classical and modern physics. Fundamental understanding andprocedures in analytical physics are stressed throughout. This sequence is recommended toall students who have an aptitude for scientific work and who are acquiring a strongbackground in mathematics, including an introduction to differential and integral calculus.Students with a strong high school physics background or a high score on the Physics APexamination may wish to consider Course Exemption by Examination, whereby the studentcan be exempted from some or all of the courses in the introductory sequence. Physics majors typically begin taking courses at the intermediate level by the end of Sophomore year, and are encouraged to complete required 300-level courses by the end ofJunior year. This schedule prepares a student for the widest array of 260- and 360-seriescourses. Of special interest are the three series of physics courses numbered 160-169, 260-269, and 360-369. These courses cover special topics as well as subjects of active research interestwithin the Physics department. The 160 series is designed for non-science students interestedin varying aspects of physical science. These courses have few prerequisites beyond algebraand trigonometry and many are open only to students who have not taken Physics 106,110/115, 120/125, or their equivalent. The 260 series of courses is open to anyone who hascompleted Physics 120 or 125. The prerequisites for 360-series courses vary, but generallyrequire physics beyond Physics 120 or 125. Requirements 326MAJOR: The major is designed to appeal to students who wish to prepare for professional or graduate work in physics as well as those who wish to study physics but have other career goals. The program for physics majors is composed of the Physics Foundation and one of thefour Options listed below. Students can also supplement their programs by taking courses atthe California Institute of Technology under the exchange program. Physics Foundation: All physics majors must complete a core of five physics courses called the Foundation. In addition to the three-term introductory sequence (Physics 106, 110 or 115, 120), the Foundation includes a course in Modern Physics with laboratory (Physics 240) and acourse in Thermal and Statistical Physics (Physics 250). Accompanying these physics coursesmust be work in mathematics including Multivariable Calculus (Math 212) and Linear Systems(Math 214). Options: In addition to the Foundation, all physics majors must complete one of the following Physics Options. Upon graduation, the student's transcript will list both the major (Physics) and the chosen Option. Some of the four Options require Physics Selectives, which are courses from the 260 or 360 series, or 300-level courses below 390 not otherwise required for the Option. Physics Option (24 units): Physics 310, 315, 316, 320, 330, 340 and four units of Physics Selectives. This option is recommended for students who wish a thorough background in physics and for those who wish to pursue professional or graduate work in physics orengineering. Mathematics Option (28 units): Physics 310, 320, four units of Physics Selectives and eight additional units from any other 300-level Physics courses below 390. Also required are at least eight units in Math or Computer Science numbered above 300 and below 397 (these coursesmust be in addition to those required math courses listed in the Foundation). This option isrecommended for students who wish a broader mathematics or computer science background. Chemistry Option (32 units): Chemistry 120 or 130, 220, 221, and 240. Also required are Physics 310, 320, 330 and either Physics 340 or Chemistry 305. This option is recommended for students who wish a broader physical science background. Education Option (24 units): Physics 320 and eight units of Physics Selectives. Also required are Education 201, 205, and 340. Education 314 is highly recommended. This option is recommended for students who wish to pursue careers in secondary science education. Physics \"Capstone\": All physics majors must complete the Senior Seminar, Physics 490 and 491. Majors participating in an off-campus program during the Senior year may repeat 490 or 491 to satisfy this requirement. COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: The comprehensive requirement for majors is met by completion of the year-long Senior Seminar (Physics 490/491) with a grade of C or better and by passing a comprehensive examination on the material covered in the Physics Foundation. WRITING REQUIREMENT: The Physics Department's portion of the College Writing Requirement can be satisfied with a passing evaluation of a student portfolio. The portfolio will consist of two items: one laboratory report from Modern Physics (Physics 240) and/or 327Advanced Laboratory (Physics 315/316), and one research report from Senior Physics Seminar (Physics 490/491). Students are encouraged to revise these reports before submittingthe portfolio. Typical formats for the required writings will be presented in the related courses.The writing is expected to be clear, precise, and intelligible to someone who has completed thePhysics Foundation. Proper spelling, grammar, and organization are essential. A student may submit a portfolio only once. The portfolio will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis by a departmental committee which will meet each semester to consider portfolios received bythe last day of classes. Failing students may fulfill the departmental writing requirement byobtaining a grade of C or better in Writing and Rhetoric 401, Writing Across the Curriculum.Students who would like to improve their writing skills in advance of taking Physics 240, 315,316, 490 or 491 may elect to take Writing and Rhetoric 401 in their Junior or Senior year; agrade of C or better will satisfy the Physics Department's portion of the College WritingRequirement. The portfolio is normally submitted at the end of the semester when the student completes the first semester of 490/491. The latest students can submit a passing portfolio is the last dayof classes in their penultimate semester. Students who fail to do so must enroll in EnglishWriting 401 in their final semester and pass with a grade of C or better. If English Writing 401 is not offered in the student's final semester, another English Writing course may be substituted with the approval of the department. MINOR: The Physics courses of the Foundation and four units of Physics Selectives. COMBINED PLAN IN LIBERAL ARTS AND ENGINEERING: The program for majors provides for entrance into the Combined Plan Programs (3-2) at Columbia University and the California Institute of Technology. Students interested in engineering should consult thecombined plan page for details of these programs. HONORS: Senior physics majors with an overall grade point average of 3.25 are permitted to present an oral and written thesis on their research for College Honors consideration at graduation. See the Honors Program and consult the department chair for details.

The mission of the department ofPolitics is to provide our students with an understanding of politics, government, and publicpolicy to prepare them to become well informed, curious, and engaged leaders in theircommunities, in their societies, and in our increasingly complex, interdependent, and pluralisticworld. Graduates of the department have found this major provides an excellent basis forcareers in law, education, business, public service, international affairs, politics, and media. The department emphasizes putting theory into practice (praxis), and strongly encourages each of its majors to pursue a variety of off-campus and community-based learningopportunities. The College has programs in Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans,Washington, D.C., and overseas, as well as the Campaign Semester program through whichstudents receive a full semester credit while working full-time on a political campaign. Politicsmajors regularly hold internships in government agencies, public interest organizations, mediafirms, businesses, and law firms around the country. The Politics Department provides financial support for student research during the academic year and over the summer. The Reath/McKelvey and Anderson Fellowships support studentsworking on a wide variety of projects in the United States and abroad. The Politics Departmentalso encourages majors to pursue Undergraduate Research Fellowships for summer researchin partnership with a faculty member and Research Abroad fellowships through theInternational Programs Office. Requirements MAJOR: The major consists of one core course (Politics 101); two International Relations courses from Politics or DWA; the Department's course in social science Research Methods(Politics 300); and at least one course (4 units) from each of the following sub-fields: AmericanPolitics; Political Theory; Public Law; and Comparative Politics. Majors are also required totake a Junior Writing Seminar (any 300-level Politics, DWA, or UEP course) that focuses onresearch and oral presentation skills. Majors must also take two other courses (8 units) in thedepartment for a minimum of ten courses (40 units). Economics 101 and Psychology 110/223(Intergroup Dialogue) are strongly recommended. No course will count toward the Politicsmajor that the student takes CR/NC. MINOR: At least five courses (20 units) within the department, or courses accepted by the department in lieu of its own. Of these five courses, three (12 units) must be advanced courses (200-level and higher) taken from different sub-fields within Politics (American Politics, PoliticalTheory, Public Law, Comparative Politics, and International Relations). WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Politics will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's writing requirement by successfully completing a writing seminar in their junior year. Politics 272 (Campaign Semester) and any 300-level Politics, DWA, or UEP course(except Politics 300) have been approved for meeting this requirement. THE SENIOR YEAR: All politics majors must complete a Comprehensive Seminar in the spring of their senior year. Students will read and discuss political science journal articles that raiseinteresting questions for the field, combine theory with empirical data, and serve as models fortheir own senior thesis. Simultaneously, each student is asked to develop a senior thesis on a 338topic in one of the sub-fields of the major, demonstrating theoretical sophistication, an ability to find and evaluate sources of data, to develop and test hypotheses, and to argue a thesis.Papers are subjected to peer review and to a rigorous drafting process. All seniors are requiredto submit a proposal for their thesis by the end of September in their senior year. Theseproposals should state the research problem, demonstrate a significant command of therelevant bibliography, and include a tentative outline of major components in the study. HONORS : We encourage highly motivated students to pursue Department Honors. They qualify for this program by achieving a 3.25 grade point average overall and a 3.5 grade point average in courses counting toward the Politics major. Only under extraordinary circumstanceswill the Politics faculty members approve a petition to have this 3.5 grade point averagewaived. Students interested in pursuing Honors should complete the courses required for thePolitics major by the end of Fall Semester. They will be required to meet all of the obligationsof the Comprehensive Seminar in the spring semester and complete a major research paperas a part of that experience. Courses American Politics and Public Policy The following courses are accepted for Politics credit in the American Politics and Public Policy subfield: UEP 204 and 301. 106 - LA Power: Politics, Policy and Justice in the City While we often locate the study of urban politics within the formal governmental arena, examining the elected officials who operate there, other actors hold a great deal of sway overthe allocation of resources and power. This course will examine institutional actors who havehad and continue to have an impact on politics in Los Angeles in particular. By exploring therole of colleges and universities (e.g., Occidental College), museums, non-profit organizations,media outlets, business associations, and trade unions, we will attempt to develop a broaderand more comprehensive understanding of how power is exercised and by whom. How havesuch institutions impacted geography, demography, and land use? What role have they playedin electing and defeating political office holders? How do these institutional actors balance,share, and/or compete for power? How much power do they have and should they have?Same as UEP 106. Prerequisite: Open to Frosh and Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors by instructor permission only. 201 - Work and Labor in America Sooner or later, we all have to work-that is, get a job. Some people even have \"careers.\" And some people are lucky enough to consider the work they do a \"vocation\" - something that isboth intrinsically rewarding and useful to society. Work occupies our best waking hours. Formost people, the nature of our work determines the quality of our daily lives. This course willfocus on the varieties of work (in different industries and occupations); how people experience 339their work on the job; how society shapes the work we do; how work shapes our family lives, our friendships, our health, and our self-esteem; and how the nature of work is changing in ourincreasingly global economy dominated by large corporations and sophisticated technology.We will look at the future of work in the context of our changing economy, values, andtechnologies. We will pay particular attention to how organized groups ? labor unions,consumer groups, business associations, and others have influenced the nature of work. Wewill also explore how government action (public policy) has shaped how our economy worksand the rules governing the work we do. These include such matters as wages, hours, flextime, family leave, job security, workplace health and safety, the quality of goods and services,and workplace participation. We will explore such questions as: What makes work satisfying orunsatisfying? How have increasing problems of low-wage work and even\"sweatshops\" in a wealthy society? How do such factors as education, skill, race, and genderinfluence the kinds of work we do and how we experience our work? What are the chances ofgetting injured or sick because of working in a specific job? How do people balancework/career and family responsibilities? Do people experience work the same way in otherdemocratic countries? What can be done to make the world of work better?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES 202 - Leadership in the Public and Private Sphere This seminar investigates leadership - in government, in business, in nonprofits - through the lenses of the social, behavioral and natural sciences, philosophy and the humanities.

Because of the pattern of growth in the area, Los Angeles is broadly defined to encompass the city, thecounty, and the region. Since politics is the study of power we will examine power in thecontext of the city; who has it, who seeks it, how has it shifted over time, and whatconsequences result from it being exercised? Significant attention will be paid to the agency ofthose who have at various times had the least power in the city; how are they represented ornot represented, how can they influence the exercise of power? Many look to Los Angeles as aparadigmatic city. We will query the appropriateness of this observation as we identify keyconcepts in urban politics, apply them to Los Angeles, and then consider how much LosAngeles sets, follows, or deviates from trends..CORE REQUIREMENT MET: UNITED STATES and US DIVERSITY 208 - Movements for Social Justice Examination of the impact that social protest movements have had on our society -and lessons that can apply to the current period.

Twelve 4-unit courses (48 units) are required for the major.Though not strictly sequenced, the major is tiered, with an overview of the field and scientificmethods (Departmental Core) preparatory to courses that survey diverse subdisciplines(Fundamentals courses within four Domains) or focus on crosscutting explorations(Specialized and Integrative Themes), which in turn are preparatory to advanced study (a400-level course in a Domain or Specialized and Integrative Themes). The requirements are:the Departmental Core (Psychology 101 or 102, 200 and 201 with grades C- or better); sixcourses from the four Domains, including at least one course from each Domain (24 units); oneof these six courses must be an Advanced Study 400 level course; and three additionalcourses (12 units). Psychology 200 (Methods in Psychological Science) is a prerequisite forsome 300 and 400-level 4-unit classes in Psychology. One 4-credit Independent Study (Psyc397 or 497) may be counted as an elective course. Students anticipating graduate work are encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses to enhance the breadth and depth of their exploration of psychology; they arestrongly encouraged to become involved in research and to take Psychology 498 (Practicum).Transfer students and those who anticipate participating in any of the College's abroadprograms should plan their schedules with major requirements and their accompanyingprerequisites in mind. Majors are expected to select one of the full-time faculty members from the department as an academic advisor and to consult with her or him regarding their course program. NEUROSCIENCE EMPHASIS Psychology majors with a special interest in neuroscience may declare a Neuroscience emphasis. Fourteen courses (56 units) are required for this emphasis. This emphasiscombines coursework across the broad domains of psychology with specific courses in theBiological Bases Domain and neuroscience-relevant coursework in other fields. Therequirements are: the Departmental Core (Psychology 101 or 102 or AP Psychology score ofat least 4, 200 and 201 with grades C- or better); two courses in the Biological Bases Domain 358(Psyc 322/322L, Psyc 403); one course from each of the other three Domains (12 units); an original empirical project (Psyc 497); a Cells-to-Society seminar; and four neuroscience-relatedcourses (16 units) in Biology, Cognitive Science, and Kinesiology. Together, the coursesselected outside of Psychology must meet the following criteria: (a) at least one coursefocused at the cellular/molecular level, (b) Biology 115 or 130, (c) at least one 200- or 300-levelcourse in Biology, and (d) at least two courses at the 300-level. Either Bio 333 or CogSci 320,but not both, will count toward the emphasis. Courses should be selected in consultation withthe academic advisor. Students intending to pursue graduate work or health professionsshould consult their advisor and/or the Health Professions Advisor about relevant courseselections in and beyond this emphasis (e.g. in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics). CREDIT FOR COURSES TAKEN ELSEWHERE: The department will apply toward the psychology major most broad-based courses in Introduction to Psychology taken at accredited colleges and universities. Introduction to Psychology will be waived for students with AdvancedPlacement test scores of four or five on the Psychology examination. In addition thedepartment will accept a maximum of three upper division psychology courses taken at otherinstitutions and passed with grades of C or better toward the completion of a Psychologymajor. Please consult with your academic advisor and the department chair for courseapproval. WRITING REQUIREMENT : The Psychology department has elected to take a \"writing-across- the-curriculum\" approach to the third year writing requirement. The department has selected an approach that is both evaluative and educational. Students will submit a portfolio containing writing samples from 300- and/or 400 level courses taken for credit toward the Psychology major to their academic advisor by the end of Fallsemester of the senior year. The portfolio will include at least twenty finished text pages,including (1) a research paper (empirical or library) of at least eight text pages, and (2)evidence of mastery of APA publication style. One writing sample in the portfolio must be (3)on a topic that required integration of information from two or more subdisciplines, and onewriting sample in the portfolio must be (4) on a topic that required understanding of thevariation between individuals, groups, or species relevant to social justice and/or wellbeing.The advisor will assess the work. If the portfolio does not pass after an attempt at revision, thestudent will be informed that s/he will need to complete a supplemental writing assignment toaddress any writing skill deficits.See the Writing Program for additional information. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE : Senior majors must take and pass a comprehensive examination early in the spring semester of their senior year. Seniors who will have the degree conferred in December may take the exam in the fall.

Same as UEP 209. Faculty Regular Faculty Scott Bogue Associate Dean for Research; Professor, Geology A.B., Brown University; Ph.D., UC Santa Cruz Religious Studies Courses in the department of Religious Studies seek to cultivate an understanding of religionas a significant, widespread, and diverse human phenomenon. To this end, courses explorethe literature, history, thought, ethics, institutions, and practices of some of the world's majorreligious traditions. Special attention is given to clarifying the role that religions have played inthe cultural and social worlds of which they are a part, both how religions contribute to and arein tension with other dimensions of culture and society. The major in Religious Studies provides a firm grounding in the liberal arts. Students will develop an ability to read sources carefully and critically, to approach the study of a topic froma range of cultural positions and from multiple disciplinary frames, and to develop well-reasoned positions. While the rigorous curriculum and comprehensive project prepare studentswho intend to pursue graduate work in Religious Studies, the skills developed in thedepartment are also valuable to students who plan to pursue a range of professions, includinglaw, medicine, business, social services, government, or religious vocations. Requirements MAJOR: A total of 40 units in the department of Religious Studies are required for the major. The major is structured to accommodate a wide variety of interests relating to the study ofreligion. Students, working collaboratively with an advisor, will design a personalized programto match their interests and objectives. Some majors may opt for a program that is broadlyconceived, seeking exposure to a variety of religious traditions and studying religion through avariety of methodologies (such as, literary studies, history, sociology, or philosophy). Othersmay choose to specialize in one religious tradition, or in one approach to the study of religion.The only required course for the major is RELS 490: Senior Seminar, which guides studentsthrough their comprehensive projects. We strongly encourage students to take courses in other disciplines - such as languages, art history, music, politics, literature, and history - that will enrich their understanding of howreligion is conceived, articulated, and practiced. We also strongly encourage majors toparticipate in international programs, especially in locations where they may encounter a new 371religious environment. When appropriate, one or two courses from outside the department or from international programs may be applied toward the major. MAJOR WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY CONCENTRATION: Given that Religious Studies is an intrinsically interdisciplinary field of study, some majors may need to partner more robustly with another discipline to pursue the course of study they have designed. For instance, a studentinterested in the presence of religion in literature or a student interested in the sociologicalstudy of religion may need to draw more heavily on the faculty and courses offered by theEnglish or the Sociology departments. Other students with a regional focus or a theoreticalfocus may need to draw on resources spread across departments. For example, a studentinterested in Asian religion may need to take courses from the Language, History, and ArtHistory departments, while a student interested in gender and religion may need to takecourses from the Critical Theory & Social Justice, Sociology, Philosophy, and Historydepartments. In these cases, majors, in consultation with their advisors, may design aReligious Studies major with an interdisciplinary concentration. A total of twelve courses (48units) are required for this major, eight courses (32 units) of which are to be taken within theReligious Studies department and four courses (16 units) from another department(s). MINOR: Five Religious Studies courses (20 units) are required for the minor. The courses, chosen in consultation with the Chair of the department, should cover a range of religious traditions and methods of studying religion. WRITING REQUIREMENT: Students majoring in Religious Studies will satisfy the final component of Occidental College's college-wide writing requirement by successfully completing the Senior Seminar and the comprehensive requirement. See the Writing Programand consult the department chair for additional information. SENIOR COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT: While courses in the major are intended to introduce students to a range of religious traditions and to orient students to a variety of approaches to the study of religion, the comprehensive project gives students the opportunityto select a research topic of particular interest to them and to pursue that topic in much greaterdepth than course work allows. Work on the comprehensive project will further cultivate andassess the skills that ground the discipline: inventiveness, research and methodologicalabilities, critical reading, analytical thinking, and effective writing and oral communication. In the spring semester of their Junior year, students will meet with Religious Studies faculty to talk about potential topics and they will conduct preliminary research. In the fall semester oftheir Senior year, students enroll in RELS 490:Senior Seminar, which guides students throughthe research and drafting of the project and which provides students with feedback on work inprogress. Although there is no class associated with the comprehensive project in the Springsemester, students are expected to continue to revise and polish their papers until the duedate. Also in the Spring semester, students will present their research orally to the campuscommunity. Once the comprehensive projects are submitted, the Religious Studies faculty assesses the papers and oral presentations, awarding them one of the following marks: Pass with Distiction(PD) is awarded to exceptionally sophisticated work that surpasses the departmentalstandards, Pass(P) is awarded to work that meets departmental standards, and Fail (F) forwork that fails to satisfy departmental standards. 372HONORS: The Department of Religious Studies awards Honors to students who have demonstrated excellence in the discipline of Religious Studies. In the Spring semester, the Religious Studies faculty review the Seniors' record in the department and makes itsdeterminations based on achievement in coursework, sophistication of the comprehensiveproject, and contribution to the intellectual community.

The effort to reliably predict or causally explain not just the natural world but our every decision and action permeatescontemporary life. From physics through the social sciences, the belief in our capacity formathematical prediction and causal explanation is increasingly dominant, so much so that wesimply take it for granted. And yet, the idea of human freedom persists. It too is taken forgranted -- not only in our daily lives where we continue to act as if we chose and decide freely,but also in our politics where it is championed and proclaimed. Nowhere is this more true thanin the Arts and Humanities where freedom is a fundamental principle. But as Socrates wouldask--do we even know what we mean when we say 'freedom'? Have we seriously examinedour ideas of freedom in light of our equally strong faith in prediction and determinate causalexplanation? This course seeks to carry out that examination and to cultivate a more criticaland well-founded concept of freedom. 281 - Religion and Politics This course will explore aspects of the complex theoretical and practical relationships betweenreligion and politics ranging from the most abstract kinds of questions regarding the very ideasof 'the religious' and 'the political' to the scrutiny of very specific, particular practices,statements, and conflicts.

How hasviolence (war, torture, martyrdom, punishment) been understood, appropriated, deployed, andresisted in religious practice and discourse in relation to politics and the state? What is 'thesecular'?CORE REQUIREMENT MET: INTERCULTURAL 290 - Banned Books: Introduction to the New Testament Apocrypha The modern-day New Testament contains only a portion of the literature (i.e., gospels, acts,epistles, and apocalypses) written by early Christians. This course will provide students theopportunity to study many of the texts that were not included in the Christian canon: the so-called \"apocrypha.\" We will investigate the process by which the Christian canon was formed,how and why some texts that were beloved by many ordinary Christians were excluded fromthe canon by church officials, and how the ideological and theological positions found in therejected texts give us a lens into some of the most heated debates in early Christiancommunities. In addition to surveying apocryphal texts and their early Christian contexts, themajor assignment of the course will be to collaborate with Prof. Upson-Saia on her currentresearch project: a study of how ideas found in the New Testament Apocrypha persist inCatholic tradition\u2014specifically, in Catholic doctrine, art, and liturgy\u2014even though the textsthemselves were excluded from the Christian Bible. Prerequisite: Open to Juniors and Seniors CORE REQUIREMENT MET: PRE-1800 and REGIONAL FOCUS 295 - Topics in Religious Studies The Contemplative Life and Social Justice 378Over the course of religious history, some have chosen lives of contemplation and prayer, seeking to explore religion in its depth dimension. This course examines the lives of DorothyDay and Thomas Merton, who in 20th century America, fashioned new forms of thecontemplative life, often characterized as much by engagement with the world as by retreatfrom it. Day pursued social justice through the founding of the Catholic Worker Movement andthe running of Hospitality Houses for the urban poor over several decades. Merton, a Trappistmonk, took vows of silence, but voiced concerns for justice and peace through his popularwritings as a religious thinker and social critic; he fostered interreligious dialogue amongChristians and Buddhists in Asia and elsewhere.

They asked: How does one live a life free of fear and anxiety over one'sinevitable and impending death? How can one die with dignity-whether violently or peacefully,whether of one's own volition or at the hands of other humans or God? How should thecommunity structure rituals of death and what should be done with corpses? And, how-if at all-will individuals live on in an afterlife? The central goal of this course is to familiarize studentswith the diversity of notions about death, dying, and afterlife in ancient cultures by analyzingliterature (philosophical, medical, and poetic), rituals, and monuments of the ancientMediterranean world. We will then contextualize these ideas, noting how and why theydeveloped from driving concerns and circumstances of particular communities, cultures, andhistorical moments.

Moreover, competence in a language other than English can provide a decidedadvantage for any post-graduate education or career objective. The Spanish and French Studies program at Occidental is designed to provide the student with an analytical grasp of the traditions and complexities of the Spanish and/or French-speakingworld. The rich cultural and literary expressions of Spain and Latin America provide the contextfor a classroom environment that builds strong conversational skills and immerses the studentin intensive language use. Similarly, the department introduces students to the rich intellectual,literary, cultural, and political traditions of the Francophone world through the study of worksfrom Africa, Canada, the Caribbean, and Europe. Classroom instruction and discussions takeplace entirely in Spanish or French, and students benefit from a state-of-the-art languagestudio (featuring computerized instruction, video programs, and daily newscasts from aroundthe world). Occidental College's strategic position in Southern California also provides studentswith numerous opportunities to use the Spanish language interactively. The department strongly encourages all students, whether considering a major in the department or not, to investigate Occidental's opportunities for study abroad (see Off-CampusStudy). In recent years, students from a wide variety of departments, including the sciences,have taken advantage of these programs, greatly enhancing their education and futureopportunities. These programs exemplify Occidental's ideal of a liberal education thatincreases sensitivity to and appreciation of other cultures. Finally, the department also invitesstudents to engage in community-based learning through the different activities available in theintermediate and advanced Spanish language classes. Linguistics at Occidental College is housed in the Department of Spanish and French Studies. Linguistics is the scientific study of language as a type of human activity: how languages are constructed and why, where they came from, and how they got that way. It also delineates thebreadth and limitations of language's usability. Thus linguistics straddles the sciences, socialsciences, and humanities. As an applied field, it is highly useful to anyone learning anotherlanguage, to those intending to teach English or any other language, to people studying othercultures (since culture is encoded and transmitted largely via language structures), and tothose studying human cognition or child development (since language structure plays a centralrole in both). Requirements FRENCH MAJOR: The French major may choose either a literature or a culture concentration. 393French Literature concentration: particularly recommended for students interested in further study of French language and culture, the literature concentration requires French 202 and sixcourses (24 units) above 202; one course (4 units) can be in literary theory or linguistics.Students must take one pre-19th Century literature course and are encouraged to take onenon-European literature course (Africa, Caribbean).

California Institute of the Arts Urban & Environmental Policy Occidental's Urban and Environmental Policy (UEP) major is an interdisciplinary program forstudents who want to change the world. It combines politics, planning, environmental policy,public health, urban studies, economics, sociology, and other disciplinary approaches. TheUEP program recognizes that \"urban\" and \"environmental\" are very much interconnected andthat issues of economic and environmental justice are integrally linked to where and how welive, work, play, eat, and go to school. Topics covered in the program include housing andcommunity development, public health, land use and transportation, environmental health, foodand resource issues, education, environmental justice, immigration, climate change, air andwater quality, water and energy supply, poverty and social welfare, criminal justice, race andgender and class relations, globalization, and other topics at the local, state, national andinternational levels. Students interested in the UEP major should have a strong commitment topublic service and social change, be interested in working on group projects with otherstudents, and be available to become involved in community activities and internships. 424The UEP major is a unique combination of classroom learning and hands-on experience in the field of public affairs and civic action. Students learn the skills of social science and publicpolicy analysis with special emphasis on applying those skills in the real world. It is anintensive major designed for students with a strong interest in public service careers such asgovernment, law, human services, urban and/or environmental planning, public health,community organizing, social work, journalism and communications, socially responsiblebusiness, or academia. The goal of Occidental's UEP program is not simply to produce policy experts, but to educate students to think and to act critically in the realm of public affairs. The program includes carefulconsideration of ethical issues that arise in the formulation and implementation of public policy.It trains the next generation of change agents and future leaders how to think critically andcreatively and act effectively to solve problems and improve society. A major dimension of UEP's problem-solving and social change-related work is its connection to the research, education, and community-based activities of the Urban & EnvironmentalPolicy Institute (UEPI). UEPI is the research and advocacy program arm of UEP and a keycomponent of Occidental's focus on community engagement. UEPI's mission is to connectideas and action to create a more just and livable region, nation and world. UEPI frequentlypartners with grassroots community, environmental, and labor organizations as well as thepublic sector. It serves as the umbrella for a variety of affiliated programs addressing foodjustice, public health, the built environment, and transportation, and includes programs andinternship opportunities around these issues. UEPI staff has helped facilitate College-wideinitiatives such as programs in Public Health and a China-Environment program that linksstudents to universities and NGOs in Hong Kong, Nanjing, and other partners in China. UEPIprovides opportunities for students to participate in real-world research, community action, andpolicy arenas. Information about UEPI is available at www.uepi.oxy.edu . Through a range of classroom-based and independent internships, students engage in the realworld of urban and environmental policy through government agencies, political campaigns,grassroots community and environmental organizations, public interest groups, social serviceagencies, labor unions, health organizations, food justice groups, and other settings. Studentsalso learn how to conduct practical applied research by working with and for communitypartners in the Los Angeles area and across the country and abroad under the supervision offaculty as well as the UEPI program staff. The UEP major coursework includes a series of intensive seminars in the junior and senior years, with introductory courses available in the frosh and sophomore years. The course ofstudy includes developing skills in public policy analysis, internships, community participation,a research project with an applied policy focus, and leadership training. In addition to theprerequisites and the core seminars, students are encouraged to take electives in a variety ofdisciplines to sharpen their expertise in different policy areas and approaches. Another important part of the program will be attendance at meetings with visiting public policymakers, journalists, and other practitioners in addition to regular course work. Some students may choose to spend a fall semester in the Campaign Semester program (offered in alternate Presidential and Congressional election years); summer research and/orinternships in Los Angeles or abroad (e.g., through the China-Environment program), throughthe Occidental-at-the-United Nations program, or in one of the fall or spring semester abroad 425programs sponsored or approved by the college. During their senior year, students will design and complete a policy-oriented comprehensive project that has an applied focus and includes original research. This project may take severalforms.

In this course, we will explore several historical modes ofperceiving and navigating the landscapes of American cities, and particularly greater LosAngeles, ranging from the pedestrian city to the metropolis of railroads and streetcars(including the famous Pacific Electric system) to the sprawling megalopolis of automobiles andfreeways. We might even speculate what a transit and pedestrian Los Angeles of the futuremight look like - will it be a return to the past, or betoken new ways of understanding, andorganizing, our everyday urban spaces? Central to this exploration will be extensive researchin the college's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections archives on railroads and their historyand on Southern California in the twentieth century.

The Writing Programprepares students in all disciplines to write effectively: to develop complex concepts clearly andfully, to organize essays and reports logically, and to maintain the conventions of standardwritten English. This standard of writing performance is upheld in all College courses. To achieve this goal, the College emphasizes expository writing and research skills in the Core 438curriculum, in courses emphasizing the methodologies of various disciplines, and in the composition courses in the English Writing Department. The foundation of the College'sWriting Program is the first-year instructional program in Cultural Studies. First-year studentstake year-long, sequenced seminars that help students developcollege-level writing strategies in rich disciplinary content to further their knowledge andcommunication of the topics they study. In addition to the Core curriculum in writing, the English Writing Department offers courses to students who want to concentrate on the most effective strategies for writing in and out of theacademy. These include English Writing 201, a class that centers on the processes and skillsnecessary to fine writing, and the College's advanced writing courses, English Writing 301 and401. Any student seeking individual instruction in writing or assistance with a particular paperwill find support and advice available at the Center for Academic Excellence (CAE), whereEnglish Writing professors work as writing specialists, and where student writing advisorscollaborate with student writers. The Director of Writing Programs will gladly advise students ofall resources available for developing their writing ability. Requirements Proficiency in writing is a requirement for graduation. Students meet this requirement in two stages, the first of which is passing the first-stage Writing Proficiency evaluation in theCultural Studies Program. Completion of the Cultural Studies courses does not by itself satisfythe writing requirement. An additional measure of writing proficiency is required; most recentlythis measure has been participation in a shared intellectual experience with required reading.Frosh are expected to pass the writing exercise that culminates the experience.\u00ac Those whodo not pass the Cultural Studies Writing evaluations will be asked to pass with a C or better acourse in the Department of English Writing (201) or another writing course designated by theDirector of Writing Programs in conjunction with the Director of the Core Program.

SECOND STAGE WRITING Writing-Intensive Seminars: Most departments require a single junior-year seminar that includes a considerable amount of writing. The final product is read by more than one professor. A grade of B- is usually required, depending on the department. Fulfillment of therequirement is met through additional coursework when the grade in the seminar is notsatisfactory. Writing Across the Major: Some departments have deemed all upper-division courses writing intensive. A few departments require more than one writing-intensive course in order to complete the Second Stage Writing Requirement in the major. An average grade of B- isgenerally required, depending on the department. See department chair for specifics.

Tuition Adjustment Policy Since faculty engagements and other commitments are made by the College for the entire year in advance, the following tuition adjustment schedule has been established in order that the College and the student may share the cost equitably when it is necessary for a student to drop a course or withdraw from the College. Status Change From Full-Time To Part-Time : The College refund policy for students dropping from full- time status to part-time status is effective only for the first five weeks of the semester. Students who register at the beginning of the term as full-time and elect to drop to part-time status will be billed on a per-unit basis 449(eleven or fewer units). After the fifth week of classes, no adjustment will be made and the student will be billed at the regular full-time rate. Part-time Status: To be considered part-time, a student must petition the Registrar's Office and be approved. Attending courses with 11 or fewer units without an approved petition from the Registrar does not constitute part-time status and the student will be subject to full-time tuition and fees. Withdrawal from the College : Students who withdraw during the semester may be eligible for refunds, depending upon the time of the withdrawal. Students must give written notification to the Registrar of their decision to withdraw and complete all withdrawal procedures to be eligible for any refunds (see tuition insurance plan ). Eligibility for tuition refunds is as follows: Withdrawal During Amount of Tuition Refunded First five days of classes* 90% Sixth through 10th day of classes* 80% 11th through 15th day of classes* 70% 16th through 20th day of classes* 60% 21st through 25th day of classes* 50% After 26th day of classes* 0% *Days of classes are defined as any business day when any classes are held. Board charges will be prorated to the date of change in status, except that adjustments will not be made for an absence of one week or less nor for the first week of a prolonged absence. Adjustments to room charges will be made only in accordance with the terms of the room contract. No adjustment will be made to student body, and health insurance fees. No adjustment except for board will be made for a student who is suspended, dismissed, expelled, or asked to leave the College for any reason. Student scholarship aid will be prorated according to published guidelines and government regulations. Financial Aid Occidental College has a long history of providing educational opportunities to qualified students from various economic backgrounds. More than 70 percent of the Occidental student body receives some form of financial aid. 450Varying amounts of financial aid are awarded to qualified students. Financial aid is given in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and on-campus employment. Awards are based upon a family's calculated needand the resources available from endowment, annual gifts, the general funds of the College, and federal and state sources. With the exception of a small number of merit programs, financial aid is awarded to students who demonstrate financial need based on federal, state, and institutional policies. The College evaluates family resources in a consistent and equitable manner. The general principle of these policies is that parents and students are the primary source of funds for post-secondary education and both have an obligation to finance educational expenses to the extent that they are able. Financial need is considered to be the difference between the cost of attendance (COA) and a family's expected family contribution (EFC), as determined by the Financial Aid Office. Students are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses. All students are expected to contribute at least $2,600 from summer earnings to assist in meeting costs of education. In addition there's an expected contribution from net student assets of 35%. Financial assistance for international students is extremely limited. Additional information and special financial aid applications are available from the Office of Admission. New international student financial aid applications should be returned to the Office of Admission. International scholarships are renewable for four years as long as the student maintains satisfactory academic progress. International students are only considered for institutional aid at the time of admission. Need-based Application Process Students seeking need-based financial aid are required to file all financial aid applications on time. Deadlines also pertain to Occidental students who are returning after having left the College. This application process allows the student to be considered for Occidental scholarships, Federal Grants, Cal Grants, work programs, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Direct Student Loans, and other Occidental loans. Deadline for entering students to submit applications: February 1 Deadline for returning students to submit applications: March 2 Deadline for all students to submit tax documents: April 19 All students must follow the instructions outlined to apply for need-based scholarships, grants, loans, and work awards. Entering freshmen who apply for admission to the College are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships. The College does not require a student to apply for financial aid to be considered for merit-based scholarships. All students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and list Occidental College (code #001249). The FAFSA is available online at www.fafsa.ed.gov . The FAFSA is due by February 1 for all first-year students, by March 2 for all returning students, by March 2 for fall transfer students, and by November 1 for spring transfer students. All students must submit copies of their and their parent's federal tax return with all supporting documents including W-2s, 1099s, all schedules (A, B, C, D, E, F, K-1, etc.), and statements. Tax documents are due by April 19 for all students, except for spring transfers whose deadline is November 1. All students must submit any additional documents requested from the Financial Aid Office in a timely manner. 451First-time applicants must also complete the CSS PROFILE and list Occidental College (Code #4581). You must pay the appropriate fee as explained in the instructions for your CSS PROFILE to be forwarded to Occidental. First-time applicants who do not complete the CSS PROFILE will not be considered for institutional aid. If you do not complete the CSS PROFILE, but you list Occidental College on your FAFSA application, you will be considered for federal and state aid only. The CSS PROFILE is available online through the College Board at www.collegeboard.org . The deadline for the CSS PROFILE is February 1 for first-year students, March 2 for fall transfer students, and November 1 for spring transfer students. First-time applicants, whose parents are divorced or separated, must also have their non-custodial parent complete the Non-Custodial Profile. The Non-Custodial Profile is available online through the College Board at www.collegeboard.org . Returning students must also complete the Parent Supplement and the Student Online Supplement. Returning students who do not submit the two supplemental applications will not be considered for institutional aid. If you do not submit the two supplemental applications but you list Occidental College on your FAFSA application, you will be considered for federal and state aid only. The Parent Supplement is available for download online at www.oxy.edu/financial-aid/forms and is due by March 2. The Student Online Supplement is available online via the Oxy student's myOxy portal and is due by March 2. Graduate Students are encouraged to file and sign their tax return and to submit them to our office as early as possible, but not later than April 19. Files completed after this date will be considered late and will not receive priority processing. Scholarships Occidental need-based scholarships are awarded each year on an individual basis in proportion to the degree of financial need and the student's academic and co-curricular record. Less than full-time students will have their need-based scholarship prorated. There is no scholarship assistance for students enrolled in less than six units. Occidental scholarship recipients may be asked to write a thank-you letter to a specific donor during the academic year. The College also offers a limited number of merit scholarships to entering students at the time of admission. Scholarship awards are based on academic ability, achievement, motivation, and promise. Merit awards are renewable for up to three additional years (8 semesters total) provided that the student continues to maintain the required cumulative grade point average of the scholarship. See the Financial Aid Policy Guide for GPA requirements of specific scholarships. Scholarship amounts are prorated if you do not attend for the entire academic year or are enrolled less than full-time. Students enrolled in less than six units are not eligible for merit scholarships. For pro-rating calculations please contact the Financial Aid Office. Grants All students applying for financial aid at Occidental are required to apply for the appropriate state and federal grant programs. California residents apply by completing the FAFSA and the GPA Verification Form. All grant awards are combined with other resources to meet financial need. The Federal Pell Grant is a federal student aid program for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a federal program that helps undergraduate students with the greatest financial need. Priority is given to Federal Pell Grant recipients. 452The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) awards Cal Grants A and B to California residents as determined by eligibility requirements set by the State of California. Campus Employment Opportunities Part-time employment is supported by the Occidental Work Award (OWA) program and the Federal Work Study (FWS) program. Occidental Work Award and Federal Work Study are normally offered as part of the financial aid award to students who demonstrate need. Loans Loans are an invaluable resource to college students and their parents in financing a college education. Loans are generally repaid within 10 years after graduating or withdrawing from school (consolidation programs can extend the number of years a student has to repay their loans). Loan obligations and interest rates are outlined in the promissory notes students are required to sign. The Occidental Low Interest Loan is administered by the College using institutional funds. Occidental Low Interest Loans (5%) are awarded up to $5,500 per year for undergraduates. The Occidental No Interest Loan is a student loan originally funded by the Weingart Foundation that awards up to $10,000 per year for undergraduate students. This generous, interest-free program was established to benefit U.S. Citizens who are graduates of California high schools. The Federal Perkins Loan is administered by the College utilizing federal and institutional funds. It is typically awarded to students with high-demonstrated need. Federal Perkins Loans (5%) are awarded up to $4,000 per year for undergraduates. The Federal Subsidized Direct Loan is a low-interest loan offered by the U.S. Department of Education. The interest on this loan is subsidized by the federal government while the student is enrolled. Occidental College students may borrow Federal Direct Loans based on their need, year in school, and satisfactory academic progress. The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan is available for students who do not demonstrate financial need or students who need assistance with their expected family contribution. The interest rate is fixed at 4.66% and interest accrual is immediate. Students may choose to pay interest while in school or have it capitalized onto the principal balance. The Federal Direct PLUS Loan is designed to provide long-term competitive rate financing for parents of dependent students to assist in meeting the expected family contribution. Federal PLUS loans may not exceed the student's cost of attendance less any financial aid a student is eligible to receive for the year. The current interest rate is fixed at 7.21%. Satisfactory Academic Progress To remain eligible for financial aid, a student must be in good academic standing as defined in the Academic Policies section of this catalog. No institutional funds are available to a student on a leave of absence or studying at another institution (excluding Oxy approved study abroad programs). Students may, however, in some cases, receive federal or state aid to study at another institution. The academic year consists of two 15-week semesters. Full-time students may register each semester for a maximum of 18 units. Students enrolled in less than 12 units each semester are considered to be part-time, and financial aid is pro-rated. 453Qualitative and Quantitative Requirements For students to maintain financial aid eligibility, they are required to make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward their degree. SAP requires students to complete a certain number of units and maintain a certain grade point average after each semester of college attendance. Federal regulations require Occidental College to monitor the academic progress of students receiving financial aid. When we disburse aid to your student account, we are certifying that you are making SAP toward your degree. Students must make quantitative (time-based) and qualitative (grade-based) progress towards their degree. The time-based requirement is the pace at which you must progress toward your degree. The grade-based requirement is measured by your GPA. Maximum Time Frame (Pace): At Occidental, if you are a full-time, first-year student you are eligible to receive institutional and state financial aid for eight semesters of full-time study. Transfer student eligibility is pro-rated. Students who require additional semesters to complete their degree are only eligible for federal assistance for no more than four additional semesters as long as they meet other progress standards and remain federally eligible. As a full-time student at Occidental you are considered to be making adequate progress toward your degree if you complete a minimum of 12 units each semester and earn a total of 128 units by the end of your 8th semester. However, since institutional financial aid eligibility extends for only four years and graduation requirements are based on satisfactory completion of 32 units each year, students should complete 16 units per semester to graduate on-time. For federal eligibility, you must complete a minimum 12 units per semester and 128 units by the end of your 12th semester. Students who are eligible to graduate prior to exhausting financial aid eligibility are not eligible to continue to receive financial aid. Repeated courses do not count as courses completed and do not contribute to maintaining SAP. Attempted courses are those for which you are officially enrolled after the last date to drop courses. Withdrawals showing as a W on your academic transcript are counted as attempted courses. All courses count in calculating a student's academic progress, including any for which the student did not receive financial aid. Grades of W are counted as courses attempted and count toward the maximum time frame. Audited courses do not count in the calculation of attempted courses as no units are earned. Academic policy at Occidental states that if a student does not receive a passing grade for a course, the course may be repeated for credit. Repeating a course does not remove the original course from the academic transcript. Both the grade for the original course and the repeated course will be posted and will calculate into the student's GPA. Both the original course and the repeated course will be considered as attempted in the calculation of \"attempted courses\" for purposes of determining SAP. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis count toward the total of attempted and completed courses. Transfer credits from another institution accepted by Occidental College are counted when measuring the maximum time frame to complete the degree. Occidental does not accept for credit any transfer grades lower than 2.0. Consult the Occidental College Course Catalog for information about how transfer credits are evaluated. 454 Students who pursue a double major or a minor are expected to complete all degree requirements within the 128 unit time frame. Your academic records will be reviewed at the end of each semester to determine that you are making SAP. Making SAP means you must have at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA by the end of each semester and you must have made progress toward you degree as outlined below: Minimum of: End of first semester 16 Units End of second semester 32 Units End of third semester 48 Units End of fourth semester 64 Units End of fifth semester 80 Units End of sixth semester 96 Units End of seventh semester 112 Units End of eight semester 128 Units Failure to meet SAP If you do not earn at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA and/or fail to earn the required minimum units, you will receive a warning notification from the FAO that you are at risk of losing eligibility for aid. If you do not earn at least a cumulative 2.0 and/or earn the minimum required units by the end of your \"warning\" semester you are no longer eligible for institutional, state, or federal financial aid. Right to Appeal If you lose your financial aid eligibility at the end of your \"warning\" semester (and the Academic Standards Committee permits you to enroll) you have the right to appeal for an additional semester of aid. The appeal must be made in writing to the Director of Financial Aid. The appeal may not be based on your need for financial assistance or your lack of knowledge on the SAP policy. It should be based on some extenuating situation or condition which prevented you from making progress. Your appeal must include a written academic plan which outlines how you plan to restore your GPA to a 2.0 or better and/or meet the minimum unit requirements. Appeal Denied 455If your appeal is denied you may still be able to regain eligibility for future semesters by enrolling at Occidental (at your own expense), earning a 2.0 or better GPA, and bringing all cumulative units up to required standards. It is also possible to take a Leave of Absence from Occidental and pursue transferable coursework at another institution. This will allow you to bring your required units up to date and show academic improvement by attaining a minimum GPA of 2.0 or better (a GPA earned at another institution will not affect your Oxy GPA). You are required to speak with the Registrar's Office to ensure units completed elsewhere are transferable to Occidental. Appeal Granted If your appeal is granted, you will be placed on Financial Aid Probation. During probation, you must follow your academic plan and resolve all incomplete grades before the FAO can make a final determination that you have met the SAP guidelines. Student Eligibility To receive aid from the programs discussed in this catalog you must: be a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, or an eligible non-citizen have a valid Social Security number have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) certificate be enrolled at least half-time (at least 6 units) maintain satisfactory academic progress be admitted as a degree seeking student demonstrate financial need register with Selective Service, if required meet other eligibility requirements as required by state and federal law To be eligible for financial aid, a student must be admitted as a regular student. Students admitted as a limited graduate or as an advanced or limited special undergraduate are not eligible for financial aid. Payment and Financing Options In addition to the traditional need-based financial aid programs, Occidental offers short- and long-term payment alternatives. These programs are available to all families regardless of financial need. The application process is separate from the need-based application process. Contact Student Business Services for information regarding these programs. Additional Information The Financial Aid Office is dedicated to helping students successfully finance an Occidental education.

The Financial Aid Office also publishes a policy handbook each academic year. It is the student's responsibility to know and understand these policies if the student is a recipient of financial aid. The programs, policies, and procedures as published in this catalog are correct at the time of printing and are subject to change without notice. Key Policies Students of Occidental College strive for high standards of excellence, equity, community and service. This endeavor requires an environment in which each individual is able to flourish. Since the Occidental student body is diverse and passionate, maintaining this community is a process that is as constant and challenging as it is rewarding. The Occidental Community is a community of difference. Divergent opinions and beliefs are not simply necessary to the community \u2014 they constitute it. Oxy students confront the possibility of disagreement, opposition and conflict in each day's activities. This can be a trying and difficult endeavor. Oxy students are united in their agreement that they are enriched by these engagements. They assert that the constructive and critical examination of their beliefs leads to intellectual, personal, and social fulfillment. Therefore, protecting the integrity of their discourse is a matter of collective concern. This principle of honor stems from a common agreement to adhere to standards of engagement that preserve the graciousness of our exchange. This requires that students engage one another honestly, but also responsibly and respectfully. The students of Occidental College define community standards and agree to advance this principle. These standards are neither static nor imposed on them; rather, they are determined by students. It follows that they continuously defend, implement, and revise this principle themselves. They mutually recognize that their principle of honor serves to preserve the passion and difference that is the Occidental Community. Student Conduct Please see the Student Handbook for college policies, including the Code of Student Conduct . Alcohol and Other Drugs Students are encouraged to review the Alcohol and Other Drugs policy , which is outlined in the Student Handbook. Academic Advising Each new student will be assigned a faculty advisor and be assigned to the Advising Center. Automobiles Students are permitted to have vehicles and must register them with the Campus Safety Department to obtain a parking permit.

For the 2014-2015 academic year, students and families may attempt to waive the Oxy plan by verifying adequate coverage in Southern California. Please note that international students are required to purchase the Oxy student health insurance plan, and may not waive. Students are required to complete the waiver process by September 1, 2014 for the 2014-15 academic year. Those who cannot waive are automatically enrolled into the plan. For more information or to start the waiver process, hosted by Gallagher Student Insurance, please go to: www.gallagherstudent.com/oxy .

Residential Education and Housing Services Occidental is a residential college that supports an integrated living and learning environment. The intellectual vitality of the institution extends to every residence hall on campus. Accommodations in the residence halls include single, double, and triple rooms. All students in residence (except Berkus House, SAE and Food Justice) must select one of the meal plans available. Students entering Occidental will be required to live on campus for their first three years. New students are assigned housing based on the information they provide on the Residence Information Form. In recognition of the specific needs of first-year students, first-year students will be housed together in a community that offers a comprehensive program of support and education for life outside the classroom. Housing agreements are for the entire academic year (two consecutive semesters). Students who withdraw from the semester will be prorated based upon the tuition withdrawal schedule. Students previously 458matriculated apply for residence during room draw through the Office of Residential Education and Housing Services. The Housing and Meal Plan License Agreement is a nine-month agreement and students may be released from the License Agreement without charges only under the following conditions: 1. Withdrawal from the College, completion of degree program, leave of absence, or participation in an approved Oxy study-abroad program. 2. Marriage (the College reserves the right to request proof of marriage prior to granting a cancellation). 3. Birth of a child. Senior standing students, with written notification to Residential Education and Housing Services are able to cancel their housing for the following year. Please check the Residential Education and Housing Services page for cancelation dates. The halls and dining room are closed during winter break. The services of Emmons Student Wellness Center, the health staff and Counseling Center staff are not available when the residence halls are closed. The College reserves the right to entertain delegates to association meetings, conventions, and other related groups in the residence halls during vacation periods. Residence students will be notified in advance of such contemplated occasions and assurance given to them that the College will use every reasonable precaution to safeguard personal property during such occupancy. The College reserves the right to enter the rooms of students living in the residence halls, and has the right to dispose of articles left by residents.
