This six step approach is undertaken simultaneously. These steps may include homeopathic remedies, herbal medicines, probiotics, nutritional supplements and vitamins custom-tailored to the individual's DNA test. The six steps are: - Detoxification - Drainage of toxins - Food allergy testing and treatment - Treatment of Intestinal Dysbiosis - Rebuilding of the Immune System - Proper nutrition and lifestyle changes to minimize re-exposure to environmental toxins and stress What to Expect An extensive evaluation will occur during the first visit to address your symptoms and to determine toxic exposures. Please bring any recent or relevant lab test results to your first appointment for Dr. Kowalski to analyze. An individual detoxification plan will then be made, including any necessary further lab testing. This detoxification process is gradual in order to avoid any discomfort and to allow the body to integrate the changes. The length of detoxification programs varies from person to person. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, chronic allergies, autoimmune problems, neurotoxic conditions, autism, ADHD and many other conditions respond very well to a detoxification program. Patients typically feel some improvement very quickly then see a gradual further lessening of their symptoms over time. "}
