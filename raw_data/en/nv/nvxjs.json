Eating right, getting enough sleep, and doing anything else that might help boost immunity may be of great benefit, but sometimes that just isn't enough to prevent you from catching a cold or getting hit with an illness. While most conventional medicines may help when the first symptoms start presenting themselves, they tend to address only the symptoms, not the cause. When your immunity is down, the first port of call should be addressing the immunity issue. There are many homeopathic remedies that do this. Homeopathy works on the simple principle of \"like curing like.\" This means that the remedies used by homeopaths work with your body in an effort to address the issue, instead of against the issue making you ill. In other words, these remedies do not work at addressing the illness itself, but rather, work at supporting your body to do so. So, where immunity is an issue, homeopathic remedies work by supporting your immune system so that your body is better able to fight off any pathogens causing the condition. As far as the principle of \"like curing like\" is concerned, homeopathic remedies are extremely watered-down variations of the cause of an illness. The idea behind this is simple - your body is better able to deal with these gentle remedies, and in so doing, develop the resistance it needs to deal head-on with whatever is causing the illness. Due to this, you may feel your symptoms worsening before getting better, but the upside is that once your body has dealt with the issue, your recovery and body's ability to cope with something similar increases. In effect, you have dealt with the problem - the immunity problem - instead of the symptoms caused by the pathogen. There is a very marked correlation between adrenal gland activity and your immune system. The hormones produced by the adrenals, most especially cortisol, play a very important role with regards to immune system regulation. As soon as a pathogen enters your body, your immune system attacks it. This is usually indicated by means of inflammation that sets in. In response, your adrenals produce more cortisol in order to combat the inflammation. This increased cortisol production is spontaneous and is part of the [reaction of the NeuroEndoMetabolic](/blog/stress-induced-inflammation-and-the-nem-stress-response/) (NEM) Stress Response to an indication of a possible threat by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Your cortisol levels usually return to normal once the pathogens have been dealt with. Cortisol levels, as well as your immune system, become compromised when you are suffering from Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS). The first stages of this condition see a marked, prolonged rise in cortisol levels, which in turn results in immune system suppression and a reduction in inflammation. This state of affairs leaves your body vulnerable to different types of infections. As your body progresses through [the different stages of AFS](/adrenal-fatigue/concepts/4-stages-of-adrenal-fatigue/), the latter stages see a decline in cortisol production. This is just as bad, if not worse, than elevated cortisol levels. While the immune system may kick in to fight off foreign pathogens entering the body, your body may not have sufficient amounts of cortisol to dampen the increasing, corresponding inflammation. This may result in chronic inflammation and numerous inflammatory diseases, including chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, obesity, blood sugar issues, and a host of other conditions that are associated with adrenal fatigue due to immunity issues. It's important to [support your adrenal glands](/blog/adrenal-fatigue-recovery-right-track/) by means of diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, and the use of remedies that target the adrenals and their function. Supporting your immune system by means of natural homeopathic remedies may certainly help not only immune function but adrenal function as well. There are a number of homeopathic remedies that actively work at [boosting your immune function](/blog/natural-immune-boosters/) by means of gentle support of your immune system. Let's look at a few of them. Baptisia tinctoria is known by many names, e.g. indigo-weed, shoofly, yellow broom, and rattle bush, to name but a few. It is a member of the legume family of plants. The root of the plant has traditionally been used in European medicine to treat a number of conditions pertaining to the throat and lymph nodes as well as the common cold and flu. Research indicates that the use of this old folks' remedy was accurate, as this plant contains alkaloids that fight infection. Additionally, recent research done on Baptisia tinctoria indicates this plant can boost immunity by helping to increase your white blood cell count and activity. White blood cells are imperative to immune function as they battle the foreign invaders, bacteria, and viruses that are the main cause of infection in your body. Your body, when battling infections, sees a decline in white blood cell count. By increasing their numbers and stimulating their activity, you give your immune system a boost, allowing your body to fight infections. The long-term use or incorrect dosage of Baptisia tinctoria may result in a number of adverse side effects. These include spasms, diarrhea, vomiting, and intestinal issues. Echinacea is family of the daisy family, i.e. Asteraceae. It is more commonly called the American coneflower. It has a number of natural substances that are antimicrobial and boost immunity. These substances include phenols, which help protect against infections and have antioxidant properties, and alkamides, which have a beneficial effect on your immune system. Research also indicates that Echinacea helps increase your number of white blood cells. As previously mentioned, these are your body's natural infection fighters. As far as contraindications go, Echinacea may have a negative effect, particularly on those who may be allergic to other members of the daisy family. Side effects include rash, anaphylaxis, and an upset stomach. Echinacea may also cause negative reactions when used with certain medications. Hydrastis canadensis has long been used by Native Americans to treat a number of diverse conditions. It is the herb of the plant that is still used for medicinal purposes. It contains the alkaloids canadine, hydrastine, and berberine. It is berberine, in particular, that should be mentioned, as it has antibiotic, sedative, uterotonic, carminative, anticonvulsant, and immune boosting properties. It seems that berberine may also enhance blood supply to the spleen, thereby improving its ability to filter your blood while releasing the compounds that are necessary for optimal immune function in white blood cells. The presence of berberine also sees to the activation of the macrophage cells that fight cancer cells, bacteria, and viruses. One of the symptoms of infection is a high fever. Berberine has the ability to enhance your immune system's ability to fight fevers. While the berberine in Hydrastis canadensis has the ability to boost immunity, it also tends to lower blood sugar. If you are diabetic or suffer from low blood sugar, do not go on a course of this treatment without first talking to your healthcare practitioner. Other possible side effects of incorrect dosages include mood changes, nausea, vomiting, and digestive issues. Your lymph nodes are an important part of your body's immune system. Your lymph is primarily made up of fluid and white blood cells. Lymph nodes clean the lymph of any foreign bodies, bacteria, and viruses, while producing antibodies to fight off disease and infection. Once the lymph is cleaned, it goes back into circulation, repeating the process. When your lymph nodes become enlarged, it may be a sign of infection. Stimulating your lymph circulation and aiding your lymph node function both help to boost immunity. Your spleen is a major cluster of lymph nodes. A part of your endocrine system, it is both a storage container as well as a filtration system for your blood, as it works to get rid of bacteria and viruses that may cause illnesses. In addition to this, the spleen is also responsible for manufacturing white blood cells that are necessary for the immune system to work at optimum levels. By supporting spleen health and functionality, you boost immunity as well. The thymus is a gland of the endocrine system. Although it secretes hormones, it may be closer to being a part of your immune system than your endocrine system because of the necessary immune functions it performs. The thymus plays a very important role in the development of T cells in your blood. T cells help to defend your body against viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Immature T cells are produced in your bone marrow and are trained to become functional T cells that attack foreign bodies in your system. This is made possible due to certain of the hormones produced by the thymus. The T cells do not only attack any foreign pathogens, however. They also activate B cells that produce antibodies need to fight infections and store the memory of past infections. Thymus remedies thus help to support the function of the thymus and boost immunity. Lachesis mutus, as a means to boost immunity, is a remedy particularly useful when it comes to bleeding. It helps by stimulating blood flow and circulation, which, in turn, helps your body get rid of any toxins so that healing can take place faster. Do take care with this remedy if you have any blood disorder, or have an autoimmune disease. Consulting your healthcare practitioner before going on a course of treatment is advised. Pyrogenium is a nosode, meaning it is derived from animal or human matter. It helps to boost immunity by focusing on issues relating to the blood. It may be effective in instances of conditions related to food poisoning and other bacterial infections. Excessive use of Pyrogenium may lead to blood damage, and should not be used by women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The parotid gland's main function is to make saliva. Research, however, indicates that the parotid gland has an immune function, as does saliva. This is due to the presence of T cells and B cells that are responsible for secreting antibodies when in the presence of any pathogens. As a result, your mouth and the parotid gland, in particular, may be seen as one of your body's first lines of defense against an illness, as many airborne diseases enter your body this way, e.g. viral or bacterial infections. Remedies for the parotid gland are thus a means to boost immunity right from the outset without your body having to wait for pathogens to enter via other pathways before springing into action.

Adrenal health and your immune system function tend to be connected. When your adrenals are compromised, they will most certainly benefit if you boost immunity, as it may reduce their workload a little, giving them a little leeway for healing. "}
