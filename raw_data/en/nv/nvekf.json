Nutrients help to ensure their optimum function and overall wellbeing. It is a known fact that the health of our gums is often a reflection of our total body health. Many popular dental products contain harmful chemicals. By opting for some of these natural ingredients, coupled with a consistent brushing and flossing routine, you can be equipped with a holistic approach to keeping your gums healthy. [Several studies](https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2004/09/10/1193238.htm) have shown essential oils such as tea-tree can have a positive effect on the treatment of gingivitis. While undiluted tea-tree oil can be toxic and should be avoided inside the mouth, many natural toothpastes now contain small quantities of this natural and powerful antibacterial agent. As well as keeping your breath smelling fresh and clean, peppermint oil has been known to be effective in preventing harmful bacteria in the mouth. [Eucalyptus oil](https://www.ciroccodentalcenterpa.com/dental-care/how-can-eucalyptus-oil-help-your-teeth/) has been used for centuries as a potent anti-inflammatory medicine, and when used in concentrated doses, has been shown to treat receding gums and even stimulate the growth of new tissue. While essential oils are a fantastic way to naturally protect your teeth and gums, caution and careful use is advised as high doses can be toxic. You may be surprised to know that humble salt can be used to keep your gums in tip-top shape. Using a salt and warm water rinse up to two times a day can protect your gums and reduce inflammation, particularly after any invasive dental procedure or surgery. Salt promotes healing, protects from infection and eases swelling. Some people use it as an alternative to mouthwash, as it doesn't irritate the sensitive mucous membranes that line your mouth. Please note to only use high grade Himalayan salt as table salt contains aluminium and barely any minerals. Sea salt may include mercury and microplastics. Known as a staple of ayurvedic and homeopathic medicine, [Neem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4441161/#ref18) or Azadirachta indica has been used in Indian cultures as a powerful anti-microbial and anti-fungal agent for hundreds of years. Leaves, bark and roots are harvested from the Neem tree and are purported to contain a powerhouse of antioxidants that are good for the whole body. Neem is commonly used in natural toothpastes and powders and has also been shown to reduce toothache and ward away plaque build-up on the teeth. [Activated charcoal](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322609#:~:text=Activated%20charcoal%20is%20a%20fine,as%20wood%2C%20produces%20activated%20charcoal.) is having a moment in the world of teeth-whitening as a safer alternative to harsh peroxide-based treatments. Bleach treatment can cause damage to the gums and teeth, as well as increase tooth sensitivity. Activated charcoal comes as a powder, paste and is used as a coating for toothbrush bristles. [Oil pulling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198813/) is an ancient practice that is commonly practiced in ayurvedic medicine. It involves swishing coconut or other oils in the mouth, which has been shown to remove toxins from the gums that cause bad breath, gum disease and bacterial build-up. Tip: Vigorously swish the oil in your mouth for up to 20 minutes while doing your morning housework and remember not to swallow the oil. You can also use olive oil or sesame oil. Please note that you should not oil pull if you have amalgam fillings. The oil will pull mercury into the oil and you will be swilling around mercury oil which is not ideal.
