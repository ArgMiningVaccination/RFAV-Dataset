Many factors can undermine immune systems, but treatments like [acupuncture](https://southcentrechineseacupuncture.com/) can effectively restore their vital functions. By stimulating the body, acupuncture therapy can help with a wide range of [health issues](https://southcentrechineseacupuncture.com/autoimmune-disease-and-acupuncture/). Vital Qi In Traditional Chinese Medicine, immunity is called vital qi (energy), which is a result of the proper function of several internal organs, namely the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. When these organs do not function properly, insufficient vital qi results, so the body has trouble fighting against external pathogenic factors, which leads to illness. Insufficient Vital Qi or low immunity is often related to the following three aspects: - Liver Qi stagnation (central nervous system dysfunction): Stress undermines liver function and can block the flow of vital Qi. - Spleen Qi deficiency (digestive system dysfunction): The spleen has a huge influence on digestive function. We rely on strong spleen Qi to absorb nutrients and discharge waste. When spleen Qi is deficient, our bodies either don't receive enough nutrients or retain toxins, both of which undermine Vital Qi. - Kidney Qi deficiency (hormonal imbalance): The kidney plays a huge role in hormonal regulation. When kidney Qi is deficient, it weakens Vital Qi.
