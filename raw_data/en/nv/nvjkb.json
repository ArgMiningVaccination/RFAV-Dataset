Downs Blvd., Administrative Specialist USF School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences 12901 Bruce B. Downs Blvd., MDC 77 8915 oatehort@health.usf.edu Section 1 T 3 (THIS PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY) 4 Tenets of the School Mission, Vision, Philosophy, and Goals s part of the USF Morsani College of Medicine, the School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences fully embraces the College's Mission, Vision and Values . In support of those ambitions, we have developed the aspirations listed below for our School ; they clearly possess congruence with the mission and vision of the Mors ani College of Medicine and the University of South Florida. The SPTRS mission, vision, philosophy, and values are reviewed and updated annually by the collective faculty . They are based on a foundation of professionalism , defined by the School as the demo nstration of the values, attitudes, and behaviors consistent with expectations of the public and the profession. For the profession of physical therapy, these values and behaviors are delineated in the America n Physical Therapy Association's (APTA's) Policies & Bylaws' Core Documents (www.apta.org ). Mission Statement The mission of the University of South Florida School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Scienc es is to demonstrate excellence in movement sciences through interprofessional education, evidence based clinical practice, research and service. This mission will be accomplished by preparing doctors of physical therapy, researchers, and clinical resident s who have a strong foundation in basic and clinical sciences, and who demonstrate excellence in contemporary, evidence -based patient client management, critical thinking and professionalism. The mission will be further supported through faculty scholarship and research, and through a clinical practice which enriches the program and serves the community. Vision Statement The University of South Florida School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation sciences, through its collaborative initiatives, will be nationally recognized for its: Innovative, integrated, and interprofessional curriculum.

DPT Curriculum Curriculum Philosophy ealth professionals must be responsive to social needs and demands. In response to this challenge, the faculty of the Morsani College of Medicine and School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences emphasize ongoing review and adaptation of educational programs to meet the needs of society for today and tomorrow. The professional curricula (MD and DPT) of the Morsani College of Medicine are designed to instill in the student a n attitude of caring. By presenting the students with clinical problems and sufficient basic science data to understand organic malfunctions, it is hoped the learning process will facilitate a lifelong significance. Curriculum Plan he physical therapy program is a full -time professional program leading to the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree. It i s completed over the course of eight terms of study. The curriculum includes 3 8 weeks of full -time clinical education. The curriculum model is a hybrid model with six integrated tracks: Foundational (Basic) Sciences, Clinical Problem Solving & Physical Therapy Sciences, Movement Science, Social Science s & Professionalism, Critical Inquiry, and Clinical Education. Although elements of each of the tracks ar e addressed in the first year, the focus is providing a strong scientific foundation during which DPT students share courses with medical students. During the second and third years, the focus shifts toward the Clinical Problem Solving and Physical Therapy Sciences and Social Science Track. In H T 9 contrast to the traditional and scientific focus of the first year, the clinical case -based Clinical Problem Solving courses are the centerpiece for the second and third years of the curriculum. CPS uses a variety of instructional strategies to support case -based learning. The cases in the Clinical Problem Solving sequence become more complex with regard to patient diagnoses, multi -system involvement, social and contextual factors, and the role of the physical therapis t. All curricular tracks undergo a similar increase in complexity of roles, modes of analysis, or types of decision -making. Course content in each track becomes progressively more integrated with content from all other tracks. For example, professional an d cultural issues raised by the Clinical Problem Solving cases are discussed in the Professional Issues Track, and learning in the Critical Inquiry Track is integrated and coordinated with the Clinical Problem Solving course. It is our belief that learning is more effective when the presentation of content is reinforced through concurrent application of information with students participating as active learners. We believe that this educational design fosters lifelong endeavors of excellence in practice, pr ofessional growth and scholarly activity. For a graphic representation of the USF DPT curriculum, plea se see Appendix 2 , SPTRS DPT Curriculum Plan. 10 Clinical Education in the DPT Curriculum he clinical education component of the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree program includes three full-time clinical education internships of progressing length. During the clinical education internships of applied clinical practice, each student has experiences with patients/clients in a variety of settin gs that encompass a range of conditions and life phases and stages . As much as po ssible, learning opportunities address a wide range of patients, reflecting the practice patterns in the APTA Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. As students progress through increasingly complex decision making during these courses, learning opportunities should occur in available levels of patient care: Primary care \u2014Integrated, accessible health care by clinicians accountable for: o addressing a large majority of personal health care needs, o developing a sustained partnership with patients, and o practicing within the context of family and community. Examples include: acute trauma triage and examination, early intervention, a collaborative primary care team that addresses loss of physical function, community -based organizations for patients with chronic disorders, occupational health services in the workplace. Secondary care\u2014 Care of patients with musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiopulmonary, integumentary , and/or other conditions . Tertiary care\u2014 Highly specialized, complex, and technology -based care ( e.g., heart- lung transplants, burn units) or specialized service in response to requests for consultation made by other health care practitioners ( e.g., patients with spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury ). Clinical Education Internships ull-time clinical education internships are completed at the end of years 2 and 3 in the curriculum. Students/interns are expected to meet progressively higher and more compl ex objectives as they progress through the individual internships . The overall clinical education internship objectives are specified in Section 3 T F 11 the CE course syllabi in Appendix 1. Clinical Education Internships Time Frame Full Time APTA CPI web Performance Level Expected Start Mid-Term Final CE 1 PHT 6841 10 weeks 400 CE hour equivalent Summer Year 2 Beginning Advanced Beginner Intermediate or Beyond CE 2 PHT 7842 12 weeks 480 CE hours equivalent Spring Year 3 Advanced Beginner Intermediate Advanced Intermediate or Beyond CE 3 PHT 8843 16 weeks 640 CE hour equivalent Summer Year 3 Advanced Beginner Intermediate Entry Level or Beyond Total CE: 38 weeks full -time, 1520 clinical hours equivalent To assure entry level competencies as DPT generalists, students/interns complete clinical education internships in the following areas : Either: A cute, Rural, or G eriatrics , Orthopedics , and Neurologic ( Adult or P ediatric) . Student assignments are structured in a variety of ways during the internships for Year 3. Examples include: Providing in -depth evaluation and treatments in one area of care with increasing complexities to beyond entry level. Having a student rotate among units within a large multipurpose health care center. Having the student rotate among the different centers through which services are provided by one contracting company (for example, a small community where one PT organization provides service to the hospital, school system, and has an outpatient center). Having the student identify a clinical practice area of focus in one or more centers (Examples: wound care, manual therapy, pediatrics). Providing opportunities to participate in community health education, administration/m anagement, and Evidence -Based Practice in -services, etc. 12 Affiliation Agreements with Clinical Facilities ny facility providing physical therapy services may initiate the affiliation agreement process with the University of South Florida School of Physi cal Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences by contacting the School CCE. The School CCE also may approach a facility to explore the possibility of an affiliation agreement with USF. Contact Olga Atehortua , Administrative Specialist , for more information ( oatehort@health.usf.edu ). Every effort is made to ensure that the center has the potential to meet DPT students' learning needs. These effort s may include : o direct communication with center staff, o review of cent er mission, philosophy, and self -assessments, and o site visits to the center to gather first -hand impressions of the care provided . The following factors are given significant consideration: o Congruence with School Mission, Vision, and Educational Philosophy. o Variety of learning experiences to be offered. o Needs of the School for particular types of learning experiences. o Experience in providing clinical experiences for other PT and PTA programs. o Number of staff who have served as clinical instructors for students in other educational programs. o Specialized programs and/or number of the American Board of Physical Therapy Residency and Fellowship Education ( ABPTRFE ) specialists on staff. o Potential for stro ng professional role models in the center. o Evidence of continuing professional development by the staff. o The facility's physical plant (cleanliness, equipment/space available, etc .) Upon collection of this information and in consultation with the School Curriculum Committee, the School CCE may take the following actions: Initiate an affiliation agreement. Consult with the CCCE to determine potential for improvement of weaknesses identified. The CCE and CCCE must agree on a plan for improvement before procee ding with the affiliation agreement process. Determine that the center does not have potential to meet the criteria for learning opportunities for clinical education internships . (In this case, the affiliation agreement process would not be initiated.) The CCE, with the Administrative Specialist, remains in contact with the clinical facility throughout the legal process of affiliation; contract negotiations average six months, and some are unsuccessful for a variety reasons. Clinical education affiliation sites must complete an affiliation agreement and provide an APTA C linical Site Information Form (CSIF ) to the School before a student/intern may be assigned to A 13 the site for a clinical experience . (Please refer to APTA webCSIF and CSIF Instructions .) Student/Intern Placement tudent s/intern assignments are based on coordination of learning opportunities that provide a variety of experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary physical therapy care. C linical internships must enable students to meet all the clinical objectives outlined by the School, and must contribute to the achievement of the outcomes re quired for the initial hands -on patient practice of physical therapy. The potential of the center's staff to model professional behaviors and provide opportunities with patients representative of current evidence -based practice across the life phases and s tages are also considered. Of paramount importance, s tudents/interns are required to meet the clinical education requirement types indicated on page 12. The clinical education objectives receive highest priority in the assignment process; convenience factors (such as geographic location of the facility) will be given lowest priority. Actual assignment is made by the School CCE for each clinical education course. It is contingent on the availability of a center(s) to meet the learning needs of the student/intern, the School's criteria for clinical centers, and timely completion of the agreement process. Clinical Education bids are sent out one year in advance for the coming clinic al education year, corresponding with the national bid dates. The clinical education affiliate determines availability of internship opportunities , which may vary from year to year. USF is an Equal Opportunity/Equal Access/Affirmative Action institution. Clinical education assig nments are made without regard for race, color, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, disability, age, Vietnam or disabled veteran status, as provided by law and in accordance with the University's respect for personal dignity. The University of South Florida School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences expects the clinical center's policies and procedures for student/intern assignment to reflect this commitment. Students/Interns may not contact facilities to discuss or arrange clinical learning experiences to meet their personal needs. Because of the importance and complexity of the processes for evaluating clinical facilities and determining student/intern readiness for clinical educatio n, any student efforts to bypass the selection and assignment process ma y result in disciplinary action by the Academic Performance Review Sub - Committee (APRSC) . Students should refer to the USF SPTRS DPT Handbook for additional information regardi ng the APRSC. Students/Interns may initiate contact with a clinical center only after receiving a placement confirmation letter from the School CCE. Students cannot be assigned to a facility if they have held employment at that same facility or if they hav e completed a significant number of volunteer hours within an affiliated center . Students may not be employed in any capacity by the clinical education center. In order to ensure that extracurricular activities do not interfere with S Students/Interns may not contact facilities to arrange clinical learnin g experiences, at the risk of disciplinary action. Student contact with a facility should occur after receipt of a placement confirmation letter from the CCE. 14 academic and/or clinica l performance, no physical therapy student may accept outside employment of any kind without prior approval of the School Director . Students may, however, be awarded an honorarium or stipend to cover incidental expenses. Student Reassignment hile the vol untary commitment by the clinical site is generally a fi rm commitment, o ccasionally it becomes necessary for the site or School to cancel, reassign , or extend the length of a student/intern's assignment (most often because of staff or corporate change s that are outside the control of the CCE and CCCE). Regardless of the reason, the CCCE sh all contact the CCE immediately so that alternate arrangements may be made as quickly as possible for student /intern placement. An unfortunate consequence of such chang es is that options for re -assignment are limited . Neither the School nor the CCE is able to make any guarantees about clinical education placements, but the CCE will attempt to locate a replacement internship, which is of similar type. Students/Interns mus t be flexible regarding time and location of internship so that other appropriate learning experiences can be identified. Students/Interns may not cancel internships. USF SPTRS student placements for Clinical Education are firm commitments. Clinical Educat ion Sequencing ll didactic and clinical education is completed in sequence. Clinical education bids are submitted by the CCCEs and CIs for students/interns who can demonstrate a specific skill set through the successful completion of particular didactic, clinical, and ac ademic coursework. Students/interns who have not successfully completed such preparation will be referred to the APRSC to determine the appropriate action. Those individuals are not permitted to participate in a clinical affiliation until and unless School administrators are confident of their ability to successfully perform those skills in the clinic setting. This may change the timing of the clinical affiliation from the planned clinical education calendar. Throughout the three -year curriculum, any studen t/intern who has a deficiency (U or I grade) in any clinical education course will be required to successfully remediate the course, following the procedures established by the APRSC. The student/intern, if approved by the APRSC and School administration, will be given only one opportunity for remediation of a clinical education course, which must be completed before the student/intern will be allowed to advance to the next year or clinical education course of the curriculum. Recommendations for remediation may include (but are not limited to), additional study time, repeating all or part of the clinical education course, or repeating the entire academic year (including clinical education internships ). W A Failure to successfully complete didactic, clinical, and academic coursework may require a change in timing of a student's clinical affiliation from the planned clinical education calendar . Successful completion of each clinical education course is required before the student is allowed to advance to the next stage of the DPT curriculum. 15 Failur e to successfully remediate the clinical education course may result in the requirement that the student/intern repeat the entire year or face dismissal from the DPT program. (Please refer to the School DPT Student Handbook for information regarding APRSC rules on two or more deficiencies. The DPT Student Handbook also has information about counseling, tutoring, and study skills services , as well as an outline of the process for grade appeals.) CCE Responsibilities ust as the CCCE has management responsibilities for clinical education, the School CCE manages the academic side of the clinical education enterprise. The responsibilities of the CCE include the following: o Educat ing students, clinical and academic faculty about clinical education. o Selecting clinical environments that demonstrate sound patient -client management, ethical and professional behavior, and evidence -informed practice. o Facilitating quality learning experie nces for students during clinical education. o Evaluating student's performance to determine their abilities to integrate didactic and clinical learning experiences and to progress in the program. o Communicate between the academic institution and affiliated c linical education sites. o Serving as the point of contact in agreement initiation and processing. o Guiding maintenance of a timely, accurate database of clinical centers. o Communicating with clinical centers in a timely fashion to determine the site's ability to accept students/interns. o Developing clinical education bids on an annual basis. o Supervising and coordinating the student/intern bid selection process. o Collating summative data from students and CIs about internship experiences for reports to the facult y through the School Curriculum Committee. o Collecting data needed for accreditation, as needed. o Orienting students/interns in preparation for all components of clinical education. o Reviewing the CE handbook for updates and changes; seeking approval of such revisions from the School Curriculum Committee, and endorsement by the faculty. o Reporting to the School faculty the status of student progress and the clinical education program in general. o Supervising staff in completion of clinical education duties. o Cons ulting with faculty during clinical education for problem solving. o Reviewing the goals students/interns establish for clinical education, in conjunction with professional development milestones. o Orienting CIs to this handbook, the APTA CPI, and clinical education in general. o Maintaining contact with students/interns and their CIs during clinical education experiences . J 16 o Documenting communication with centers and students/interns during clinical education experiences. o Reviewing and discussing student/intern performance at mid -term and final evaluation with CI/CCCE and students as needed. o Identifying and solving problems that interfere with student/intern learning experiences. o Assigning course grades for students/interns. o Conducting clinical center site visits . o Providing APTA Credentialed Clinical Instructor Programs (APTA CC IP)\u2014 basic as well as advanced \u2014for clinical faculty development . o Actively participating in the Florida Consortium of Clinical Educators (FCCE) of the Florida Physical Therapy Association . The CCE is an ex officio, voting member of the School Curriculum Committee. Active participation of the CCE in this committee is indicative of the important role that clinic al education plays in the DPT curriculum as a whole, and helps ensure on- going communication between the academic/professional and clinical components of the curriculum. The CCE reports to the Curriculum Committee the effectiveness of the processes for sel ecting clinical centers, the assignment of students/interns, and any other related clinical education issues that arise or require modification. The Curriculum Committee will make recommendations on any changes in the clinical education structure to the fa culty as a whole for timely consideration and endorsement (the same process as is used for changes to didactic portions of the curriculum). Technical Standards and Essential Functions The C ollege and School acknowledges Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and PL 101- 336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but asserts that certain minimum technical standards must be present in prospective candidates for admission, progression, and graduation. The School has identified certain standards that students must meet in order to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and render a wide spectrum of patient care. Student readiness for clinical education is based not only on scholastic ability, but also on the physical and emotiona l capacity of the student/intern to be the best possible physical therapist with the requisite skills, professional attitudes, and behavior. Candidates for the DPT degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in five areas: observation and other sense s; communication; motor; conceptual, integrative and quantitative; and behavioral /social. Reasonable accommodation , including technological compensation, can be made for some disabilit ies, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary would mean that a candidate's judgment is mediated by some one else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, third parties cannot be us ed to assist students in accomplishing curricular requirements in the five skill areas specified above. T 17 Observation and the Other Senses Candidates must be able to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences, including, but not limited to, physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, microbiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. All candidates must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distan ce and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and other sensory modalities. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Candidates for the DPT degree must have somatic sensation and the functional use of the senses of vision and hearing. Candidates' diagnostic skills will be lessened without the functional use of the senses of equilibrium, smell, and taste. They must have sufficient exteroceptive sense (touch, pain and temperature), sufficient propr ioceptive sense (position, pressure, movement, stereognosis and vibratory) , and sufficient motor function to permit them to carry out the activities described in this entire section. They must be able to c onsistently, quickly, and accurately integrate all information received by whatever sense(s) employed, and they must have the intellectual ability to learn, integrate, analyze and synthesize data. Communication All candidates should be able to speak, to hear and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the healthcare team. A candidate must possess reading skills at a level to be able to accomplish curricular requirements independently and provide clinical care for patients. Motor Coordination o r Function All candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers. All candidates should be able to exe cute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Physical T herapy candidates should be able to perform basic examination and evaluation procedures, design and carry out a physical therapy plan of care that addresses the patient's impairments/functional limitations, perform contemporary physical therapy interventio ns safely and effectively , and evaluate the response to those interventions. 18 Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physical therapist candidates include cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prevention of falls, application of pressure to stop bleeding, application of bandages, the opening of obstructed airways and the performance of patient transfer/transport maneuvers . Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities All candidates should exhibit the ability to perform measur ement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of professionals, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, candidates should be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes All candidates must possess the emotional health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of all patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. All candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively when str essed. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Empathy, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, inter est and motivation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and educational processes. Technical Questions he technical standards presented above are pre requisite for admission to, progression in, and graduation from the College and School. The following questions may help to determine a student/intern's ability to succeed in both didactic and clinical components of the School curriculum. o Is the student/intern able to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences? o Is the student/intern able to analyze, synthesize, extrapolate, solve problems, and reach diagnostic and therapeutic judgments? o Does the student/intern have sufficient use of the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical examination? o Can the student/intern perform palpation, auscultation, and percussion? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to relate to patients and establish sensitive, professional relationships with patients? T 19 o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to communicate the results of the examination to the patient and to his colleagues with accuracy, clarity and efficiency? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to learn and perform routine tests, measurements and physical therapy interventions ? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to perform with precise, quick and appropriate actions in emergency situations? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to display good judgment in the assessment and treatment of patients? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to possess the perseverance, diligence, and consistency to complete the curriculum and enter the practice of physical therapy ? o Can the student/intern reasonably be expected to accept criticism and respond by appropriate modification of behavior? Determination of Student Readiness for Clinical Education he School faculty is responsible for determining st udents' progress toward these standards, achievement of course objectives, development of ethical and professional behavior, and safe practice. As such, faculty members are responsible for determining student readiness to engage in clinical education based on these criteria and the rules of the Academic Performance Review Sub - Committee (APRSC) . Data used by the faculty to determine readiness and progress toward practice expectations include benchmark exams, Longitudinal Integrated Assessments (LIA), project s and laboratory practical and course examinations each semester , USF SPTRS Technical Sta ndards and Essential Functions , and reports from Course Directors. In addition, students must demonstrate safe practice standards in order to pass the LIAs and lab pra ctical examinations that are integral parts of many of the physical therapy courses. The Professional Behaviors for the 21 st Century, as measured by the Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool (PBAT) [See Appendix 4] , and A PTA web Clinical Performance Instrument ( CPIweb ), which is the evaluation tool used during clinical education course assessments and includes five \"red flag\" items that are foundational elements of practice that students must s uccessfully demonstrate at the appropriate level for clinical education learning outcomes (See Appendix 1) . Finally, students/interns must attend all required Clinical Education orientation sessions prior to beginning clinical education courses. T 20 Preparing for Clinical Education Center Clinical Education Manual t is strongly recommended that each clinical center have a clinical education manual or have students review the appropriate section of the department's policies and procedures manual upon arrival at the center. Having the student/intern review such a document before beginning the clinical rotation will help him/her develop a feel for the organization and prepare for the experience. In addition, the information confirms the center's responsibility for preserving the privacy, dignity, and safety of all peopl e involved in the care of patients and the education of students/interns . Most of this information can be extracted from departmental policies and procedures, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) and /or Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) regulations. Suggested information to include: 1. pa tients' and students' rights ( note: patients' rights must include the right to refuse treatment provided by a student physical therapist.) 2. Release of information/confidentiality of the medical record Authorization for photographic and other video use of su bject 3. Informed consent for care and to participate in demonstrations 4. Procedures for reporting illegal, unethical, and incompetent practice 5. Emergency procedures 6. Departmental philosophy and objectives 7. Organizational chart 8. Criteria for selection of CIs 9. Staff development program 10. Peer/utilization/quality review programs 11. Consumer satisfaction program 12. Support services available to students (parking, meals, library, lockers, information about the area, etc.) 13. Safety rules, hazardous materials, universal precautions 14. Samples of documentation forms 15. Job descriptions 16. Objectives of clinical education program 17. Occurrence reporting 18. Research and human subject policies and procedures Section 4 I 21 Initial Student Contact with Assigned Clinical Instructor tudents/interns must contact the assigned CI/CCCE at least three months prior to the first assigned day of clinical education, and e -mail or fax to the CI a copy of the completed FCCE Student Data Form (See Appendix 9 ); along with any other required information , such as immun izations, background check s, drug screen s, etc. Failure to do so may result in a delay in beginning the assignment, or may necessitate reassignment. Many centers have specific requirements that are time sensitive ; because these requirements are subject to change, students/interns must complete requirements in a timely manner and allow ample time for the centers to respond. Many centers require on- site orientations and paperwork that must be completed before initiating formal clinical education. Failure to c omplete all orientation and credentialing requirements shall result in delayed clinical education. Orientation of the Student/Intern to the Clinical Center he CCCE is encouraged to prepare a summary of key information that can be sent to each student pr ior to his/her arrival at the center. Information should include hours of operation, parking, dress code, CI name, phone /text number s as applicable , driving directions, information about meals, etc. A formal, structured orientation to the center (and depar tment) as early as possible in the clinical rotation relieves many student concerns and often forestalls potential problems that are a result of \"no one told me\" or \"I didn't know.\" Time needed for orientation is primarily dependent on the size of the cent er and the student's prior experiences. A typical orientation include s the following: o Introduction to key personnel , their responsibilities, and chain of command o Tour of the center and review of student/intern safety procedures o Location of equipment and supplies o Desk space, office supplies, library and other resources o Introduction to documentation, the medical record, filing , or EHR systems o Introduction to patient scheduling and billing o Initial observation of PT patient care o Emergency procedures, evacuation routes, safety rules, infection control o Calendar of events for department and timetable for student objectives o Review of confidentiality and patient/employee/student rights policies (see HIPAA De- Identification and Compliance ) o Review of student credentials , FCCE Data Form , and objectives o Hours of operation o Dress code o Review of policies and procedures manual o Regulatory updates S T 22 Expectations of Clinical Instructors Each clinical instructor receive s a Certificate of Completion of Continuing Education Unit hours, as appropriate, from the USF School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences at the end of each clinical education affiliation in which they have supervised a student /intern. Clinical instructors have the right to: Access and review the DPT curriculum . Communicate ( either formally or informally ) their thoughts and ideas regarding the strengths and weaknesses of any component of the curriculum to the Director or faculty of the School . Participate in and contribute to the formal formative and summative evaluation of the clinical education program a s part of the DPT curriculum . Consult and obtain professional development assistance to improve individual clinical teaching , including completion of the APTA Basic and Advanced Credentialed C linical I nstructor P rograms . Consult and access professional development opportunities to enhance the patient/client management, administration, critical inquiry, an d consultation skills of their center's physical therapy service . Clinical instructors have the privilege of: Obtaining a pproval for center sponsored in- service activities as USF continuing education courses. Eligibility to apply for Voluntary Faculty appointment under Morsani College of Medicine A ppointment, P romotion, and T enure guidelines. Clinical instructors are encouraged to use the School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences website for clinical education -related information and other school updates . Section 5 Section 5 23 Assignment and Effectiveness of Clinical Instructors he assignment of clinical instructors by the CCCE should be based on specific criteria for clinical competence determined by each clinical center. These criteria may include in -services and continuing education courses attended, advanced degrees, clinical experience (no less than one year) , teaching experience (in-services, clinical education, continuing education, formal classroom) , credentialed status, and research experience. CCCEs are encouraged to give thoughtful consideration not only to the potential clinical instructor's clinical skills but also to his/h er interest and willingness to teach. CCCE s may consult with the School CCE to develop guidelines and a formal procedure for establishing criteria for clinical instructors appropriate for their centers and consistent with job descriptions. The effectivenes s of clinical instructors as educators is determined by the CCE in collaboration with the CCCE s. Means for determining effectiveness incl ude the review of completed APTA CPI s, Professional Behaviors Assessment Tools , formal feedback from students on the AP TA Physical Therapist Student Site Evaluation form, CI self - assessment, and direct communication and/or observation between the CCE and students and the C CCE and CI s. Each center is encouraged to include criteria for clinical instructor responsibilities i n job descriptions and performance evaluations. The CCE is available to assist in the development of these documents and relies on the CCCE to take action on any deficiencies according to the center's policies. Ineffectiveness of clinical instructors inclu des such behaviors as: Failure to identify potential \"red flags\" early in the student performance Failure to document critical incident(s) when warranted Failure to contact the USF SPTRS Coordinator of Clinical Education, Dr. Gina (801) 259- 7007. Failure to provide students with on- going feedback on their performance and the CI's expectations Failure to complete t he APTA CPIWeb in a thorough and timely manner Failure to develop on- going, progressively more challenging learning opportunities for students Failure to demonstrate contemporary physical therapy practice consistent with the APTA Code of Ethics, Standards of Practice and Guide to Physical Therapist Practice , Florida statutes 486 an d 456 , laws , and rules . T 24 Clinical Instructor Development he USF SPTRS CCE regularly offers both the APTA Basic and Advanced CCIP CEU courses for CI development , in collaboration with the FPTA . SPTRS prefers that CIs are, at a minimum, APTA Basic credentialed. CIs must be APTA Basic credentialed to utilize CEUs for being a CI toward license renewal in Florida. Please check your jurisdiction for more information (FSBPT .org). Continuing Education hours are available for Clinical Instructors from USF SPTRS with appropriate verification signatures from the student /intern and the CI as follows: 1 Continuing Education Hour (CEH) for Clinical Education is equivalent to 160 hours of clinical instruction. No more than 6 CEHs can be earned for a single student rotation, for a maximum of 960 hours of clinical instruction allowed acco rding to Florida rules , per biennium, for individual license renewal out of the 24 required Florida continuing education hours. Effective date: January 1, 2008. USF SPTRS is responsible for authorizing and awarding certificates for CEHs to CIs who provide clinical instruction. In order to receive appropriate credit, the student/intern and CI must provide the CEH verification forms (with signatures) at the time of completion, using the following methods: FAX: monitor or maintain individual CEU information; this is the responsibility of each licensed PT, per Florida Statutes . (Please refer to Rule 64B17- 8, F.A.C. and 64B17- 9, F.A.C. for additional continuing education information, or vis it the Florida Department of Health's Continuing Education tracking system. Communication mail is the official method of communication between the USF Morsani College of Medicine faculty and all students. Therefore, it is the students' responsibility to check USF Health e -mail accounts daily . Students are held accountable for a timely response to all e -mail transmission requests. T E 25 CCE Contact Information Gina Maria Musolino, PT, MSEd, EdD Coordinator of Cl inical Education and Associate Professor USF School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences 12901 Bruce B. Downs Blvd., MDC 77 Tampa, Between CI and School CCE The CCE makes every effort to site -visit or phone visit CIs while they are supervising student s/interns . The purpose of the visit is to determine first-hand if students are m eeting performance expectations; if the clinical instructors have any concern s about the learning experience ; and the general quality of learning opportunities. CIs may also initiate contact at any time. It is the responsibility of the student to assure that the CCE is notified of any changes in the agreed upon plan (see \" Absences\" and \"Promptness\" sections ). Because absences have serious implications for the curriculum as a whole, and because every clinical center becomes an extension of the university, it is important that the faculty be notified when any of the following events occur: Change in location or assignment to units within an organization We must know where the students are at all times in case of emerge ncy or if an occurrence report is required , and to assure appropriate cl inical affiliation agreements and clini cal education hours . Students are to update the USF SPTRS CE Contact Information Form as needed, any time changes occur. The changes may include location, hours, and CI assignment. The updates are the responsibility of the student intern and are to be emailed to gmusolin@health.usf.edu as soon as determined. Student has excused absence(s) The CCE and CCCE plan for completion of missed hours. This will be determined on an individual basis, with consideration of each student's learn ing needs. All clinical hours for each CE 1, 2, 3 must be completed . Excessive requests for leave or change in working hours Granting requests will be determined on an individual basis to determine if absences would be detrimental to accomplishment of learning objectives. Change or extended absence of CI The school may need to assist in any plans necessary to assure supervision of the student. Change in corporate /ownership structure This may affect the status of the affiliation contract. Please contact the CCE. 26 Supervision of Students/Interns ecause many students in this program have prior work experience in health care, it is especially important that their objectives and goals be met when patient assignments are made in clinical education. Student interns are expected to be \" learning workers \" yet require direct, on -site supervision. Students must be \"on -site supervised\" as defined in the rules of the Florida Board of Physical Therapy ( fsbpt.org ): State of Florida, Department of Health, Division: Board of Physical Therapy Practice, Chapter: Minimum Standards of Practice 64B17- 6.001 Minimu m Standards of Physical Therapy Practice. Available: http://www.flrules.org/gateway/ruleno.asp?id=64B17 - 6.001&Section=0 (Effective 06/01/09; Accessed September , 201 4.) Section 1(e): Direct Supervision \u2014Supervision of subordinate personnel performing actions subject to licensure pursuant to Chapter 486, Florida Statutes, while the licensed supervisor is immediately physically available. On -site Supervision means direct supervision. [emphasis added] Students assigned to clinical centers in other states (www.fsbpt.org ) are responsible to research and become familiar with the applicable state statutes that may a ffect their clinical education before beginning the clinical education experience. In any case , no less supervision than previously described above will be acceptable to the School. USF physical therapy students are supervised or evaluated by a licensed physical therapist only . Other learning opportunities that do not involve direc t physical therapy patient care may occur with the supervision of other healthcare providers. Students may not be assigned duties to \" fill in \" for absent employees or vacant positions. Students should not accept assignments that are not related to their learning objectives and goals . Clinical instructors are not to relax on- site supervision because students have previously functioned without that level of supervision in previous positions (for example, the student may be a licensed physical therapist assistant). Students and/or CIs are required to report any problems related to supervision to the School CCE immediately so they can be resolved without delay. B A licensed Physical Therapist must be immediately physically available to directly supervise the student intern's performance of patient care activities. 27 Counseling Students/Interns linical instructors are expected to communicate with the School CCE if serious student/intern performance or behavior problems arise. The CI must use his/her professional judgment in distinguishing between advising (recommending, suggesting) in order to improve weaknesses in student performance, and referring for professional counsel ing when a student has serious problems that disrupt his/her ability to function successfully in the clinical environment. The USF Morsani College of Medicine provides voluntary, confidential counseling services for student emergencies or counseling needs through the HELPS Program (813-870-0184) . CIs are encouraged to take immediate action by contacting the School CCE to arrange for intervention if the need arises. Student interns are expected to be physically and mentally fit to fulfill the duties of a physical therapist and to meet the demands of practice. Occurrence Reports f a USF physical therapy student/intern is involved in any accident/incident with potential inj ury to self or others during clinical education, he/she must comply with the center's policies and procedures for reporting the incident using the appropriate documents. In addition, in connection with the professional liability protection provided to students by the USF Health Self -Insurance Program (SIP), all incidents must be reported by students to the SIP Administrator via the School CCE who will arrange for this reporting and the HPSO/CNA commercial rider carrier (see Appendix 6). The incident/occurrence should be reported by the student. Department managers or CCCEs may choose to complete an addendum on their organization's letterhead instead of, or in addition to, the student's report. The purpose of this reporting is to have a record of the incident should any future legal action be taken. Students are advised to complete the occurrence report in a timely manner when the information is fresh in their minds. The format for the occurrence report is as follows : Occurrence Report by: _________________________________ Student name Date and time of occurrence : __________________________________ Names of pe rson/s involved : ___________________________________ Brief description of the occurrence : _______________________ Signature of person reporting NOTE: Students are not eligible for worker's compensation benefits. C I 28 Evaluation of Student/Intern Performance he School uses two assessment tools in the evaluation of student performance in the clinic: the APTA CPIWeb (2006) and the Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool (PBAT) . The APTA CPI ha s been adopted because of its relationship to the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice and the CAPTE criteria for the performance of graduates. Each assessment tool is provided to the CI prior to the scheduled internship, via hard copy and/or web-based service. The APTA CPIWeb require s student s/interns and CIs/CCCEs to complete a one -time, two -hour Continuing Education Unit training session through the APTA learning center (see Appendix 5 , APTA CPI Training Quick Guide ). The competency level must be achieved to successfully complete the training before utilizing the live evaluation APTA CPIWeb site. Students and CIs use the APTA CPIWeb to identify and discuss learning needs and goals before, during , and at the end of clinical education (see Appendix 5, APTA CPI Training Quick Guide ). The APTA CPIWeb evaluative instrument provides a consistent and validated format to assess the 18 professional foundational elements for practice and patient/client management skills . The Professional Behaviors Assessment Tool is designed to evaluate those abilities that are attributes, characteristics, or behaviors explicitly part of the profession's core of knowledge and technical skills (especially the APTA Code of Ethics and Core Values), and absolutely required for success in the profession of physical therapy . (For more information, see Appendix 4 .) The PBAT is completed as needed for formative and summative feedback to the student. Utilizing the Weekly Planning Form to proactively develop the ongoing internship is highly recommended. When Critical Incidents occur related to the student intern's performance, the completion of the Critical Incident Report is required. Both the Weekly Planning Form and the Critical Incident Report Form are available in electronic formats via APTA PT CPIWeb. With each new CI assigned, students/interns are expected to discuss the strengths and weaknesses they have identified through self -assessment, as well as those identified in their evaluation by former clinical instructors. Discussing goals assists in progress towards achievement of learning goals without repetition or interruption. Student s/Interns must make continual progress during clinical education. Students must be proactive in this process. The School CCE has responsibility for the final assignment of grades for clinical education courses . Clinical education courses are graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U ). The CCE will determine the course grade based on a review of the student/intern's a nd CI's completed APTA CPI and PBAT and the professional judgment of the CI regarding the student/intern's strengths, weaknesses, ability to meet performance expectations per syllab i (see Appendix 1), and potential for continued success. The CCE submit s grades to the M COM DPT Registrar in a timely manner. T 29 APTA CPI Student Performance Expectations With the adoption of the APTA CPIWeb (2006), performance criteria of the CPIWeb are foundational elements of practice, and therefor e the student must achieve appropriate performance on all key indicators of each skill . Review sample behaviors in the APTA CPIWeb for each criterion . APTA CPI Criteria Red Flag Items : Foundational Elements Safety Professional Behavior Accountability Communication Clinical Reasoning Concerns with student performance in any of the above criteria must be communicated with the student and the C CE immediately by phone : (801) 259- 7007 e or SPTRS office phone (813 -974-2254) for appropriate intervention. Please refer to the APTA CPIWeb for further instructions on completion of the APTA CPIWeb and the sample criterion. Hints for Evaluation of Performance Evaluation is professional judgment about a student's ability to meet the established standards presented on the forms provided. Evaluation of performance \u2014whether self-assessment or evaluation by someone else \u2014is challenging. It is a matter of professional judgment . Each instructor establish es criteria for performance that are influenced by professional expectations and values. The initial orientation discussion between student and clinical instructor about strengths, weaknesses , and goals is critical for setting the stage for learning progre ssion . If expectations of both the student and clinical instructor are clarified initially, there will be fewer misunderstandings about evaluation of performance. It is assumed that all clinical instructors are fair and reasonable in their expectations and evaluation of students , unless proven otherwise. It is also a given that all students set high expectations for their own performance and are eager to take on the challenges presented to them. CCCEs and CIs are also encouraged to set weekly progressive go als unique to their clinical environments to assist in setting a road map for student success. Red-Flag concerns: Safety Professional Behavior Accountability Communication Clinical Reasoning If you have questions about any of these aspects of clinical education, please contact the Coordinator of Clinical Education immediately. 30 Some recommendations for grading self and the performance of others are: Avoid personal biases and interests that have nothing to do with the student's learning goals and performance. In reporting student performance, stress behaviors that the student can improve, rather than personal opinions about the student. Focus on the goals. Were goals set high enough to challenge the student? Were goals set and modified appropriately throughout the learning experiences? Compare initial and final performance. Has the student made major gains in performance? Tell the student what it takes to be successful. What a student is expected to do to be successful should not be a secret. Be confident in your judgment. Students know what they do well and what they do not. Clinical instructors know what good physical therapy is and what is not. Utilize weekly planning forms to guide learning and focus on c linical education objectives. Complete t he APTA Basic CCI P, which provides additional training in planning, preparation, scaffolding clinical learning experiences, clinical education performance evaluation , instructional strategies, and their management an d legal implications . Student/Intern Evaluation of Clinical Education Experiences tudents/interns use the APTA Physical Therapy Student Site Evaluation Form to evaluate the overall learning experience at the mid - term and end of each full -time clinical education experience. Release of Student Information nformation regarding the rights of students in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA ) is provided here for review. Each clinical center is encouraged to have a similar rule regarding the confidentiality of their student records. CCCEs and CIs may not reveal any information to other parties about the student without the student's written pe rmission. Pursuant to the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC Par. 1232g), 34 CFR Par. 99.1 et seq, Florida Statues Sub. Par, 228.093 and 240.237 and USF Rule 6C4- 2.0021, Florida Administrative Code, students have the right to: S I 31 Inspect and review their education records Privacy in their education records Challenge the accuracy of their education records Report violations of FERPA to the F amily Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Ma ryland Avenue, SW, Washingto n, D.C. 20202- 8520 and/or bring actions in Florida Circuit Court for violations of Rule 6C4 -2.001, Florida Administrative Code.

The University Directory contains only the following information about current students : student name, local and permanent address, telephone listings, c lassification and major field of study. The Directory information is circulated in the course of University business and therefore, is accessible to the public as well as to students, faculty, and staff. Students must inform the USF Office of the Registra r in writing ( using the form available for that purpose), if they wish directory information to be withheld. Such requests must be received within the first two (2) weeks of the semester and will remain in effect until the student has not been enrolled at USF for three (3) consecutive semesters . Notification to the University o f refusal to permit release of directory information via the University Directory must be received no later than the end of the first week of classes in the Fall Semester. P 32 Student/Agency Personnel Exposures at USF-Affiliated Practice Sites he Employee Health Departments at the affiliated practice sites will evaluate students and agency personnel who report significant exposures to blood/body fluids and communicable diseases while on rotation. Significant exposures include needle sticks, sharp injuries, non -intact skin and mucous membrane exposures to blood, body fluids or exposures to airborne communicable diseases. Exposures should be handled as follows: 1. The student /agency personnel should report the exposure to his/her instructor/supervisor immediately. 2. The student/agency personnel fill out the employee section of the affiliated site's Employee Incident Report. 3. The instructor/supervisor fills out the supervisor sect ion of the Employee Incident Report. 4. The student/agency personnel take the completed incident report to Employee Health as soon as possible after the exposure. The student/agency personnel should bring the following information on the source patient: name, medical record, diagnosis , and room number. 5. Students/agency personnel reporting a needle stick/sharp injury from a patient must be evaluated within one to two hours for appropriate prophylaxis. In these cases, if Employee Health is closed, the student should contact the site's nursing supervisor. The student/agency personnel will be provided with the following evaluation: First aid treatment as necessary. Investigation of the source patient and HIV and hepatitis tests as necessary. Baseline lab work. Follow -up tests at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months will be offered. There will be no charge for the required lab tests. Employee Health will provide the appropriate prophylaxis. HIV/AIDS and Other Infectious Diseases hen an HIV -infected individual comes to the attention of the U niversity, whether student, faculty or staff member, confidentiality of the individual as well as the individual's welfare and that of the U niversity community must be respected. Other infectious diseases will be handled appropriately and reported according to State requirements. Bloodborne Pathogen Exposures and Exposures to Communicable Diseases olicies and procedures concerning bloodborne pathogen exposures and exposures to communicable diseases ( e.g., tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, chicken pox, pertussis, ebola ) are in place at each of the major clinical teaching facilities. T W P 33 During orientation programs an overview of procedures is presented. Students must be familiar with the policies and procedures of each clinical facility and care fully comply with all requirements in case of injury or expos ure to communicable disease . Students must report a ll needle sticks and other exposures to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids immediately t o their supervisor s and to the employee health nurse at the facility where the incident occurs . 34 Expectations of Students/ Interns Dress Code and Appearance tudents/interns are required to present a professional appearance at all times. The guidelines listed below will help ensure interns meet these standards. 1. Current s tudent identification badges (both the USF badge and if one is provided by the center) must be worn at all times. Students are to wear a white lab coat unless excused fr om doing so by the clinical instructor because it interferes with patient interaction or varies from the facility's dress code. USF badges must be replaced annually at the student's expense. 2. Men are expected to wear dress shirts, ties and slacks. Women are expected to wear business dress shirts or blouses, skirts or slacks. Clothing is to be pressed and clean. Students should be prepared with a change of clothes should theirs become soiled during the day. Fabrics that do not wrinkle are strongly recommended. All students must wear appropriate underwear, and clothing should be opaque and non-clinging. Clothes must be of a length and style to protect the student's modesty during treatment activity. (For exam ple: deep cut necklines, exposure of the midriff or low back, and short skirts that cause exposure when bending are not acceptable. \"Low -rider\" pants are not acceptable.) 3. Socks or hosiery are mandatory. Shoes must be closed -toe, clean , and shined. Athleti c or running shoes are not permitted unless they are acceptable as work shoes by the center. For sanitary reasons , as well as to maintain the integrity of shoes for support and professional appearance, shoes worn for leisure or sports activities should not be worn as work shoes. 4. Students are to be neat and well -groomed during all components of clinical education. Any extremes of fashion in dress, hairstyle, nail color, visible tattoos, (etc.) should be avoided. 5. For patient and personal safety, students must have hairstyles that will not obstruct vision. Long hair should be pulled back and secured. Short hair should be styled to Section 6 S 35 prevent the hair from falling into the student's eyes. Other considerations are patients grabbing or pulling the student's hair, or hair touching a patient at any time. Lengthy beards or mustaches are not acceptable. 6. NO artificial fingernails or long fingernails are permitted , as they place interns and patients at risk for infection . USF and its Medical Services Support Corporation direct that patient care providers will not wear artificial fingernails or nail -piercing jewelry. Natural nails should be no longer than \u00bc inch past the fingertip, and should not have chipped or cracked polish. Excessive and multiple polish colors and designs are discouraged, as they may distract from patient care. 7. Tattoos, body piercing and other body adornments must be covered or removed during clinical practice. Body piercings may be offensive to patients and pose safety risks during patient care. 8. For patient and personal safety, students are to keep jewelry at a minimum. Earrings cannot dangle or have loops that may potentially get caught by, pulled on, or entangled with a patient or equipment . Because all jewelry (watches, rings, pins, bracelets, etc. ) accumulate dirt and micro -organi sms, they should not be worn. In particular, rings and other jewelry with stones should be removed during patient care because of the risk of hurting the patient. Attendance Requirements tudents/interns must be prepared to begin clinic at the times and on the days agreed upon with the CI. Students follow the hours and pattern of operation of the center or the CI. For example, some students m ay be assigned five 8 -hour days per week , while others are assigned four 10 -hour days. Prior to starting the 1st day a student is in the center, the CCE is provided with the Contact Information form. The student is to update the Contact Information form daily, as needed , and re - submit to the CCE . The University, College and S chool calendar s are suspended during the Clinical Education 1, 2 and 3 courses . That is, the student s follow the holiday and operation hours of the center(s) in which they are assigned, rather than that of the University of South Florida. Although some center ci rcumstances may require longer hours, students are expected to participate in clinical education at least 40 hours/week. Note that many centers may work hours beyond 40 hours per week. Be aware that additional hours (approximately 10 -20 per week) are required outside scheduled clinical education time to prepare for patient/client care. If the center provides weekend services, students are required to follow the guidelines for coverage that the staff follows , at dates and times arranged with the CI. If the c linical center provides coverage on holidays, students may be assigned holiday coverage. The student is to be offered \"compensatory time off ,\" consistent with the staff policies and procedures of the clinical center for any weekend and holiday coverage. We encourage that the time off be used within the week of this extra coverage so the student is not overly taxed. Students may not accumulate the time off and use it to shorten the length of the clinical education experience. All assigned clinical education hours must be completed. If a S 36 change in standard hours occurs, the student must update the USF SPTRS CE Contact Information form as soon as determined and email it to Dr. Musolino. A student must be directly supervised by a license d physical therapist at all times \u2014either the assigned CI, or a substitute CI (who has been designated by the assigned CI and is willing to serve ) in all situations when the assigned CI is not present. If a substitute CI is utilized, the student must update the Contact Information form. The student and CI must determine the learning experiences and goals to be achieved during weekend and holiday coverage to reduce the risk of students being used as employees. Guidelines for supervision of students (please ref er to the \" Supervision of Students /Interns \" section on page 2 8) must be followed on weekends and holidays. Other learning experiences may require attendance at non -patient care activities, such as patient rounds, in- services and staff or committee meetings. Students may be assigned by the CI to research or review materials to enhance clinical performance, to gain new knowledge, and for learning opportunities within the communities served. Students may be assigned an in- service presentation, evidence- based case report, or other project (s) to enhance the clinical site. Students are expected to be contributing members of the rehabilitation team. Absences tudents/interns are expected to attend all hours of instruction, including clinical education. In the event of sudden illness or need for absence with short notice, the CCE , CI, and CCCE must be notified by e -mail for the purpose of professional liability , in addition to notifying the supervising CI via phone or text message . Unexpected Absences During clinical education, the student will telephone and e -mail the CI, CCCE, and School CCE to report his or her absence, indicating the nature of the absence or the emergency. It is the prerogative of the CCE, in consultation with the student, to excus e the absence and to facilitate any needed make -up. All Clinical Education i nternship hours are required to fulfill the CE internship requirements. Planned Absences Students/Interns may request planned absences, yet are required to make up any missed time in clinical education. Any planned absences are approved at the discretion of the CI/CCCE and CCE. Students/Interns are discouraged from exercising this option if at all avoidable, due to related CE expectations for the APTA CPIWeb and Professional Behavi ors. Students/Interns with excessive absences (planned or unplanned) , place their clinical education success at risk. S 37 Students who miss scheduled clinical education hours are expected to acquire the same level of competency in clinical education. Planned absences /hours should be made up, in advance , whenever possible. Religious Holy Days All students, faculty and staff at the University of South Florida have a right to expect that the University and clinical centers will reasonably accommodate religious observances, practices and beliefs. Students are expected to attend instruction, including clinical education, as determined by the University and School. The calendar is announced at the beginning of each academic term. The University, through i ts faculty and clinical centers, will make every attempt to schedule required clinical education in consideration of the customarily observed religious holidays of those religious groups or communities comprising the University's constituency , but students are required to follow the hours of the center to which they have been assigned. No student shall be compelled to attend clinical education at a day or time prohibited by his or her religious belief. The student must include planned time off for holy or specified religious days in the Contact Information form completed prior to beginning the clinical education assignment . The plan must be submitted to the CCE for review and acknowledgement. Students absent for religious reasons will be given reasonable opportunities to make up any missed clinical education time. The student must submit a written request to the clinical instructor and a plan for make -up of lost time should be completed in advance, whenever possible . Any student who believes that he or she has been treated unfairly with regard to the above should contact the School Director at 813 -974-9863. Promptness ardiness conveys a very negative impression. It suggests a lack of planning and preparedness and is viewed by CIs as rude and disrespectful. Tardiness can disrupt the operation of the physical therapy center. This applies not only to morning reporting but also resuming duties after meals, attending meetings, etc. A student must call the CI as soon as possible upon realizing that tardiness is unavoidable. It is the student's responsibility to initiate discussion about modifying the daily schedule if there are reasons other than personal convenience that are resulting in tardiness. Student interns are encouraged to arrive early. A repeat pattern of tardiness places a student at risk for successful completion of the internship. Students/interns who are habitually tardy or attempt to depart early (before patient care and related documentation is completed) are subject to failure on T 38 professio nal indicators, with excessive tardiness or absenteeism putting them in danger of failing the clinical education course. (For more information on these indicator s, please refer to the APTA CPIWeb and PBAT .) Disruption of Center Operations he CI may send a student away from the center at any time the student's/intern's behavior or unsafe practice places the student/intern or others at risk. These situations will be addressed immediately. The CI must contact the CCE to determine a course of action, which may include: Evidence of remediation , so that the student no longer pos es a risk to self or others before returning to the center. Termination of the clinical education experience (see \"Student Reassignment\" section , page 1 5 of this document ). Referral to the School APRSC for remedial and/or disciplinary action, which may result in dismissal from the School . Personal Activities reparation for other academic work that interferes with patient car e is not permitted during scheduled clinical education time. Students are to complete all campus -based assignments , NPTE preparation, and patient care preparation during their own evening and weekend time. Students must refrain from personal phone calls , texting, or other communication during clinical education. Students are not permitted to have personal cell phones, beepers or other devices activated while in clinical practice , and no texting is allowed . An allowable exception would be centers that have designated devices for patient/client care. The clinical instructor and CCCE will provide guidance regarding acceptable device usage when integrated within the patient management systems ( e.g., electronic health records, electronic medical devices, telehea lth devices, other assistive technologies). Health Requirements n or prior to the first day of clinical education, each student must submit to the CCCE/CI for review records containing the following documentation (which is updated prior to initiating CE ): 1. CPR/BLS Certification (obtained through M COM) 2. Certification of HIV/Bloodborne Pathogen Education (obtained via USF MCOM LEARN ) 3. of HIPAA Orientation (obtained through USF MCOM LEARN ) or required by the affiliate on- site. T P O 39 4. Evidence of current personal Health Insurance . Proof of current major medical (including hospitalization) health insurance is required for each year of enrollment 5. Health Information Form (obtained through M COM/SPTRS) 6. Florida Consortium for Clinical Education Student Data Form (see Appendix 9). 7. Evidence of Background Check (note: centers may require an updated report from the one required at program matriculation, see Appendix 10 ). 8. 10-panel Drug Screen (if required by the center and acquired at student's own expense , see Appendix 10 ). 9. Any additional documentation requested by the site ( e.g., attestation forms, additional immunizations) . The purpose of the se procedure s is to protect the public and the student/intern . For planning clinical educational experiences, it is necessary for students to reveal any medical or movement problems that may need to be accommodated or monitored. Disciplinary action may be taken against any student who fails to divulge information that places others or self at risk. The documentation presented in the studen t's FCCE Student D ata Form (see Appendix 9) and other records contain confidential student information ; please follow FERPA guidelines for protection of the student records . Student health is ultimate ly the responsibility of the individual student. The Student Health Committee of the MCOM facilitates student health by providing programs to assist students in meeting their physical and mental health needs. Specifically, the committee sets guidelines and monitors student medical data at matriculation and during the years of enrollment . The committee formulates and reviews policies and programs and assesses implementation and compliance with institutional and State of Florida requirements and guidelines. The Morsani College of Medicine has the following health related requirements that must be met prior to matriculation: 1. Students must have personal medical insurance in effect at all times during enrollment at USF M COM. During orientation you will be required to sign a statement certifying you have health insurance coverage. Annual re - certification is required throughout your enrollment. Information on basic health insurance policies will be available at orientation for students who do not have current health insurance. 2. DPT Student Immunization and Physical Examination records must be on file with the M COM. Specific vaccinations required are listed in Appendix 3 , Immunization Requirements. For further assistance with these records, students may contact Linda Lennerth, RN, MSN (974- 3163 or llennert@health.usf.edu ). 40 Students are responsible for all costs involved in obtaining physical examinations, immunizations, background checks, drug screens, and obtaining any required copies of records. Students mus t be prepared to present their clinical education requirements to their CI/CCCE prior to the first day of their affiliation at each clinical center. Student interns may be required to present the documents to the USF SPTRS CCE for attestation and should be prepared to provide them no later than 60 -90 days in advance of the start of CE. Please do not include holidays and University breaks in the calcula tion of prep time. Note: Students should retain the original copy of each document in their clinical education portfolio; although some centers may request to see the original documents rather than accept a copy. Some centers may require students to complete an additional physical examination , background check, and/or drug screen, and require certain additional immunizations following the center's policies and procedures. Students are strongly encouraged to determine this by reviewing center informati on and the affiliation agreement provided to them as early as possible in order to assure timely compliance . The student should contact the CCCE at least three months before the affiliation begins to make arrangements to have any necessary examinations com pleted before beginning the affiliation. Failure to do so may result in time being taken away from the learning experiences and a delayed clinical education start date . Student interns must be fully credentialed and complete all orientation processes in advance in order to be prepared to begin patient care for clinical education. Delayed start time is considered an unexcused absence that will have to be made up. Failure to do so may result in delay in beginning an affiliation. The delay may also affect su bsequent timing and sequencing of the curriculum and clinical education internships. Emergency Care for Students ach student is personally responsible for all expenses that may result from emergency medical care provided during clinical education affilia tions, thus the requirement that each student have evidence of personal major medical health insurance coverage, including hospitalization. Should a minor emergency occur, first aid should be administered as it would for any employee. If a more serious acc ident occurs , proper emergency action should be taken. The student is responsible for alerting the CI/CCCE to any potential medical problems and action that may be necessary because of an existing condition. Policies and procedures concerning blood- borne pathogen exposures and exposures to communicable diseases ( e.g., tuberculosis, chicken pox) must be in place at each of E 41 the clinical centers. Students are to know the policies and procedures of each clinical facility and carefully comply with all requireme nts in case of injury or exposure to communicable disease. For example, all needle sticks and exposures to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids should be immediately reported to the CCCE and to the occupational health nurse at the facility wh ere the accident occurs. In addition, the USF Director of Health Administration, who is a member of the USF Student Health Committee, must be notified within 24 hours (813 -974-3163). Student Illness tudents with an illness or medical condition that may be communicable to patients or staff should not have contact with patients. If students are unsure whether they should be in patient contact areas, they should seek medical advice for evaluation of their internship status. Students are to comply with the clinical center's policies and procedures for evidence of medical release to return to work. Persons with the following medical conditions should not be allowed patient contact without medical clearance: o Active chicken pox, measles, German measles, he rpes zoster (shingles), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis , ebola, and other communicable diseases . o Diarrhea lasting more than three days or accompanied by fever or bloody stools. o Conjunctivitis. o Group A streptococcal disease (i.e. strep throat) until 24 hours of treatment has occurred. o Draining or infected skin lesions. o Oral herpes with draining lesions. Medical clearance is also required following any extended absence due to illness, injury, or other reasons for medical leave. Background Checks and Drug Screens ach physical therapy student is required to complete three clinical education affiliations at various healthcare facilities during the course of the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree program. Many of these facilities require a current (within 30 -90 days) criminal background check and drug screening before accepting the assignment of the student to their facility. In addition, the application for license to practice as a physical therapist involves review of the applicant's criminal background. All clinical facilities have the right to refuse the placement of students based upon the results of their background checks. This action may also result in the inability to assign students for their clinical education internship courses . S E 42 Some affiliating clinical centers may require a current background c heck before the student is permitted to begin a clinical education affiliation. Costs associated with background checks are the responsibility of the student. For step -by-step instructions on obtaining a Florida fingerprint background investigation and/or drug screen, please see Appendix 10. Students may be requested to complete additional federal/state background checks in the future or may be required to update the criminal background check upon request . Students are strongly encouraged to determine if an additional background check will be a requirement of the center as soon as possible to avoid delays in initiating their learning experiences. Drug screens may also be required by certain facilities. For step -by-step instructions on obtaining a drug screen, please see Appendix 10. Students must be aware that many clinical sites list conviction of a fe lony or other misdemeanor convictions as grounds not to accept a student for clinical or administrative training. (See Florida Statutes Section 456.0635, given below, for further information.) This is done solely at the discretion of the clinical education affiliate. USF STPRS does not accept responsibility for any student's eligibility for continued progression to a clinical program or eligibility for licensure as a health care professional after failure to pass a criminal background check or drug screen. Clinical sites may also deny students as students/interns due to non- compliance with the health requirements ( i.e., immunizations) or lack of expected professional behaviors ( e.g., USF criteria, and APTA Code of Ethics). The student has a continual obligation to report any criminal conviction that may impact the student's continued ability to participate in the clinical education program to the School Director and Coordinator of Clinical Education within 15 days of its occurrence. A positive drug test and/or criminal background c heck or other variance may exclude a student from clinical placement and make it impossible for that student to complete the clinical competencies required for graduation from USF MCOM SPTRS. The Coordinator of Clinical Ed ucation will make no more than 2 attempts to place a student having a positive criminal background check and/or positive drug test; or other v ariances ( e.g., non- compliance with health care requirements, remediation).

History. \u2014s. 24, ch. 2009 -223; s. 1, ch. 2012 -64. Housing, Meals, and Transportation tudents/I nterns are responsible for all expenses related to clinical education, including the location of their own housing. Students may be eligible for small stipends, meal tickets or housing assistance provided by the clinical center . However, students must be prepared to meet all their financial and housing needs during clinical education. Students are responsible for all related travel costs to and from their clinical centers. Geographic location of clinical education sites remains a low -priority for USF SPTRS placements. Students/interns shall expect to travel and frequently will be required to go outside their \"home\" locations for clinical education internships ; therefore they should plan and budget accordingly . S 45 Student Liability Insurance tudents/I nterns are provided protection against general and professional liability claims (limits of $100,000 per incident and $200,000 in aggregate for students) by the University of South Florida Health Sciences Center Self - Insurance Program, a self -insurance program created by the Florida Board of Gover nors pursuant to Chapter 240.213, Florida Statutes. An HPSO/CNA rider is also provided within $ 2M/$5M limits. Certificate s of protection are submitted to each Center with the agreement for affiliation (See Appendix 6.) Should a center require evidence of insurance for an individual student, the student is responsible for providing such documentation. Information on liability insurance policies is available in the School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences clinical education office. The Certificate of Insurance is included in Appendix 6 , and updates are available on the SPTRS website (health.usf.edu/medicine/dpt/).

If concerns in any of these areas should arise, please contact the CCE immediately . See the APTA CPIWeb for additional information. According to the \"dimensions of performance,\" st udents at entry level are expected to perform (for all criteria) as follows: Quality: Highly skilled with high level of efficiency and effectiveness Supervision/Guidance: Independent performance with consultation Consistency: Quality performance is routine Complexity of tasks/environment: Very few tasks are controlled by the CI Efficiency: Economical and timely effort At the end of Clinical Education 3, students are expected to be at entry level for all APTA CPI performance criteria. Learning experiences must be available for all APTA CPI criteria during Clinical Education 3. Appendix 1, page 2 DEFINITIONS OF PERFORMANCE DIMENS IONS AND RATING SCALE ANCHORS CATEGORY DEFINITIONS Performance Dimensions Supervision/ Guidance Level and extent of assistance required by the student to achieve entry-level performance. As a student progresses through clinical education experiences, the degree of supervision/guidance needed is expected to progress from 100% supervision to being capable of independent performance with consultation and may vary with the complexity of the patient or environment. Quality Degree of knowledge and skill proficiency demonstrated. As a student progresses through clinical education experiences, quality should range from demonstration of limited skill to a skilled performance. Complexity Number of elements that must be considered relative to the task, patient, and/or environment. As a student progresses through clinical education experiences, the level of complexity of tasks, patient management, and the environment should increase, with fewer elements being controlled by the CI. Consistency Frequency of occurrences of desired behaviors related to the performance criterion. As a student progresses through clinical education experiences, consistency of quality performance is expected to progress from infrequently to routinely. Efficiency Ability to perform in a cost-effective and timely manner. As the student progresses through clinical education experiences, efficiency should progress from a high expenditure of time and effort to economical and timely performance. Rating Scale Anchors Beginning performance A student who requires close clinical supervision 100% of the time managing patients with constant monitoring and feedback, even with patients with simple conditions. At this level, performance is inconsistent and clinical reasoning* is performed in an inefficient manner. Performance reflects little or no experience. The student does not carry a caseload. Advanced beginner performance A student who requires clinical supervision 75% - 90% of the time managing patients with simple conditions, and 100% of the time managing patients with complex conditions. At this level, the student demonstrates consistency in developing proficiency with simple tasks (e.g., medical record review, goniometry, muscle testing, and simple interventions), but is unable to perform skilled examinations, interventions, and clinical reasoning skills. The student may begin to share a caseload with the clinical instructor. Intermediate performance A student who requires clinical supervision less than 50% of the time managing patients with simple conditions, and 75% of the time managing patients with complex conditions. At this level, the student is profici ent with simple tasks and is developing t he ability to consist ently perform skilled examinations, interventions, and clinical reasoning. The student is capable of maintaining 50% of a full-time physical therapist's caseload. Advanced intermediate performance A student who requires clinical supervision less than 25% of the time managing new patients or patients with complex conditions and is independent managing patients with simple conditions. At this level, the student is cons istent and proficient in simple tasks and requires only occasional cueing for skilled examinations, interventions, and clinical reasoning. The student is capable of maintaining 75% of a full-time physical therapist's caseload. Entry-level performance A student who is capable of functioning without guidance or clinical supervision managing patients with simple or complex conditions. At this level, the student is c onsistently proficient and skilled in simp le and complex tasks for skilled examinations, interventions, and clinical reasoning. Consults with others and resolves unfamiliar or ambiguous situations. The student is capable of maintaining 100% of a full-time physical therapist's caseload in a cost effective manner. Beyond entry- level performance A student who is capable of functioning without clinical supervision or guidance in managing patients with simple or highly complex conditions, and is able to function in unfamiliar or ambiguous situations. At this level, the student is consistently proficient at highly skilled examinations, interventions, and clinical reasoning, and is a capable of serving as a consultant or resource for others. The student is capable of maintaining 100% of a full-time physical therapist's caseload and seeks to assist others where needed. The student is capable of supervising others. The student willingly assumes a leadership role* for managing patients with more difficult or complex conditions.

Introduction USF SPTRS complies with Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, in providing opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities. At the same time, prospective candidates and current DPT students/interns must be capable of meeting certain technical standards. The following technical standards specify those attributes the faculty considers to be essential in successfully completing clinical education internships, didactic and practica l training and in practicing physical therapy safely and responsibly. These standards describe the essential functions that DPT students/interns must demonstrate in the requirements of professional clinical education, and thus, are pre -requisites to entra nce, continuation, and completion of training in the School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sciences.
