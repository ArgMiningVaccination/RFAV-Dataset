The services and products of applied anthroposophy - from the Waldorf school movement and biodynamic food through to anthroposophical nursing care, remedial education and medicine, do not have a legally secure foundation in all countries. In order to rectify this the ELIANT Alliance founded in 2006, gathered over a million signatures and in 2011 presented them to the European Commission. Since January 2012 our alliance has been active as a non governmental organisation (NGO) in Brussels. A regular newsletter informs more than 250,000 subscribers about the activities of ELIANT and important developments in the EU that affect these activities. Major social changes threaten to destabilise Europe. The European motto \u00abdiversity in union, union in diversity\u00bb can only be realised if the conditions are created for intercultural understanding between nations and people to succeed. That is what the anthroposophical initiatives wish to support. [Our newsletter](/en/news/newsletter-archive/anti-microbial-resistance-the-silent-pandemic) keeps you up to date! You are welcome to subscribe and in doing so help to realise the motto of Goethes Fairy Tale - \u00abOne alone does not help, but rather he who unites with others at the right time\u00bb.
