In Chinese Medicine theory, there are five natural elements that exist within us, as they do in nature. Each season belongs to a particular element and has unique correspondences. When we study nature's patterns and cycles, we can learn how to support our own health and stay well year-round. Fall's Associations in Chinese Medicine element: metal yin organ: yang organ: large intestine climate: dryness time: 3-5am yang organ time: 5-7am virtues: purity, self worth, receptivity, inspiration The fall welcomes the metal element. Trees drop their leaves, days are shorter and cooler, and pumpkin spice lattes replace iced mochas. We depart from the expansive, endless days of summer and hunker down into routine and structure. While some of us long for summer's sun, fun and freedom, others feel exhilarated by the crispness and structure promised by fall. This year, we should acknowledge that the shift into fall may feel a bit heavier, even for those of us who LOVE the cooler season. COVID has disrupted structure and routine. There is an endless news cycle of sadness and loss. With COVID and wildfires, our lungs need more protection and support than ever. We didn't really get that expansive, fire energy of summertime- nostalgia lingers in the air. And we may not feel so ready to move inward, since we've already been isolating since March. Arguably, we've been operating out of a \"metal\" place for months. With all that its endured, our metal element could surely use some love right now. Signs of metal imbalance relate to various Lung and Large Intestine patterns of disharmony. For example, prolonged grief can lead to lung qi deficiency, with tired breathing or low immunity. An inability to \"let go\" can cause stagnation in the lungs and large intestine with symptoms like constipation or asthma. Viral infections and poor air quality directly impact the lungs, causing phlegm, weakness, dryness, and toxicity. And resisting seasonal change... not flowing with the natural shifts in our environment... can also cause lung and large intestine disharmony on physical and emotional levels. We can use the teachings and practices of Chinese Medicine to support our body, mind and spirit in the midst of seasonal change. And Fall offers many gifts and opportunities for reconnecting with our health. Now, our focus turns to strengthening the Lungs and Large Intestine, gathering inspiration, and practice that which we observe in nature: letting go. To feel our best, we need to find balance in the metal element, embrace its virtues, and learn from the lessons of the season. Along with your seasonal acupuncture tune-up (though this particular fall, we do recommend more frequent general wellness visits with your acupuncturist), consider these 10 wellness tips for a happy and healthy you this fall: Practice letting go. Come fall, we may feel the weight of excess accumulation from the year in the form of mental and physical clutter. Just as the trees let go of their leaves, it's time to shed what no longer serves us. Whether it means cleaning out a closet, winding down a relationship, or ending a habit, finding ways to let go will help ease the transition into fall. Protect your neck. In Chinese Medicine theory, \"wind is the cause of 1,000 diseases\". Wind enters the body at the back of the neck- \"the wind gate\"- and causes conditions that develop quickly and enter the lungs- like colds, flus, headaches, and sore throats. Temperature fluctuations that are typically seen this time of year make us even more susceptible to wind. Remembering to wear a scarf or hoodie offers extra protection against wind invasions. Practice deep breathing. The Lung organ system is most active during fall- who doesn't love taking deep breaths of fresh, crisp autumn air? Deep, cleansing breaths are necessary for stress release, clear thinking, and proper physiological functioning. Deep breathing exercises stimulates lung qi, which contributes to a strong immune system and an uplifted spirit. Tip: include chest opening essential oils like pine, eucalyptus, or frankincense into your breath work practice. Do some grief work. Grief is part of the qi of the season and the emotion associated with metal and the lungs. There is decay in nature, and a strong sense of letting go as nature prepares for new life. It's natural to feel some sadness this time of year, but 2020 has pushed us into an unrelenting and intense grief cycle on so many levels. Acknowledging feelings of grief and creating a practice around it will allow feelings of sadness and loss to move through in a healthy way. We recommend acupuncture, breath work, or speaking with a counselor, Connect with what inspires you. STAY INSPIRED! Inspiration is the yin to eliminations yang. While the theme of fall is to let go, inspiration is an important virtue of the metal element. The job of the lungs, after all, is to \"inspire\". Whether it's revisiting a good book or podcast, picking up your yoga practice, cooking, starting an inspiration board, or FaceTiming with a mentor... connecting with what inspires you will support the spirit of the lungs and help you feel uplifted- especially as we continue to socially distance and hunker down. Sip on spices. The flavor associated with the fall is \"pungent\", which means aromatic and spicy. Pumpkin spice lattes and chai teas fall under this category. Spices likes cinnamon, ginger, clove, and anise help clear the lungs from congestion and phlegm, open the airways, and stimulate proper respiratory functioning. It's important to keep the lungs strong as they are the first line of defense against illness. Eat well. So long, salads and watermelon. Eating raw, cold-natured foods during the cooler months contributes to damp accumulation, which feels like congestion, heaviness, and lethargy. It's time for nourishing soups, stews, and stir-frys. The color associated with fall is white, so try including white and spicy foods like scallions, leeks, horseradish, onion, and garlic into your cooking. Spices counter dampness and congestion, following that theme of clear breathing and clear releasing... inspiration and letting go. Get organized. Who enjoys shopping at the Container Store as much as I do? Ok, maybe the thrill of new bins and desk organizers isn't your thing. But if there's a time of year to finally get things in order, here it is. The metal element enjoys structure and organization. We may have lost that in some areas of our life this year, particularly with virtual schooling and working from home. Organization, in a healthy amount (no extremes) creates space for ideas, inspiration, and planning.

The climate associated with fall is dryness. While the lungs mostly prefer to be dry, too much dryness disrupts proper lung functioning. Chapped skin, a scratchy throat, and dry nasal passageways are signs of lung dryness. To nourish the lungs and keep the membranes healthy (which is essential for optimal immunity), make sure to stay hydrated. Other ways to soothe lung dryness: sip honey in hot water, eat pears and mucilaginous (slimy) foods like okra and eggs, use a humidifier, and lather up with almond or coconut oil. Boost your Wei (Defensive) Qi. Our Wei qi is our outermost layer of qi that circulates on the surface of our body, just beneath the skin, protecting us from wind invasions and airborne pathogens. Wei Qi translates to Defensive Qi, and it's controlled by the Lungs. This is the first line defense of our immune system, which can become vulnerable during seasonal shifts. Acupuncture, herbal medicine, and essential oils reinforce the Wei qi and strengthen our defenses. Check out our related article, [\"5 Acupressure Points for Immune Support\"](https://balancecharleston.com/blog/2020/4/5/wellness-series-part-1-7-acupressure-points-for-immune-support), to learn how to use acupressure on points that stimulate the Wei Qi and boost immunity. Herbal medicine is very specific to each individual, and we recommend consulting with your acupuncturist to find the best formula for you. Many will include the ingredient Huang qi (astragalus) which strengthens Lung qi and our exterior. Favorite essential oils to diffuse for boosting Wei qi include tea tree, pine, fir, lavender, and eucalyptus. Here's to a resilient Fall. Stay strong, ya'll.
