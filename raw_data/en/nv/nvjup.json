What To Know About Additional Doses [By One Medical](/blog/author/one-medical/) Updated August 7, 2023. Clinical Editors: [William Kimbrough, MD](/providers/william-kimbrough/) and [Megan Dodson, PA-C](/providers/megan-dodson/) The CDC is recommending boosters for certain groups after they have completed their primary [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#recommendations) series. Here's what you should know: Who is eligible for the COVID-19 booster shot? Here are the recommendations for a booster based on age and the type of vaccine that was given in the initial round of vaccination: Second Booster Use the CDC's [COVID-19 Booster Site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html#when-you-can-get-booster) for more information about when you need a booster. What is the bivalent vaccine and how is it different from the original vaccine? The bivalent COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA in August 2022. \"Bivalent\" means that the vaccine has been customized to target the two strains of COVID-19 that are currently causing the majority of infections in the country. Updating a vaccine like this isn't a new idea - it happens every year with the seasonal flu vaccine, for example. Please refer to the chart above for booster recommendations by age group and vaccine brand. People who are [moderately or severely immunocompromised](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#mod) have different [recommendations for vaccine doses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). If you have an immunocompromising condition, it's best to have an in-depth discussion with your healthcare provider so they can help you figure out what vaccine schedule is right for you. When do I get a second booster? A second booster dose is recommended for those ages 65+, and for individuals who have immunocompromising conditions. There are no further booster recommendations for individuals under the age of 65 who are not immunocompromised. Does my booster shot need to be the same type of vaccine as my first and second dose? No. The CDC has approved a \"mix and match\" strategy, meaning that individuals who are eligible for a booster shot can receive a different brand for their booster than they received for their primary series. However, the \"mix and match\" strategy is not approved for patients under the age of 5 years. Pfizer or Moderna are the preferred brands for the booster, as the FDA limited the use of the J&J vaccine due to an increased risk of a blood clotting condition. However, if you are unable to receive Pfizer or Moderna, you will still be able to receive the J&J vaccine. What are the side effects of the booster vaccines? Side effects reported after the booster vaccines have been similar to those experienced with the original series. According to the CDC, fatigue and pain around the injection have been the most commonly reported side effects, while most side effects have been mild to moderate. Severe side effects have been reported to be very rare with these current COVID-19 vaccines, but may occur. How can I get a shot if I qualify for a booster shot?
