Pre-Congress Symposia African Research Workshop IL AR-01 Revisiting African traditional medicine within the 21stcentury context -past, present and future perspectives Authors Khalid S1,2 Institute 1Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Science & Technology, Omdurman, Sudan; 2Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Khartoum, P.O. Box 1996, Khartoum, SudanDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399630 Although Africa appears culturally heterogeneous with thousands of distinct tribes, dialects and languages, it is united by a common thread of traditionalmedical systems and spiritual attributes. African biodiversity, coupled withthis deeply rooted African ethnobotanical heritage, has already contributed anumber of novel chemicals entities resulting in potent pharmacotherapeu-tics, and Africa still remains a promising untapped reservoir for the discoveryof more diverse chemical entities. African flora have already demonstrated their chemical diversity by providing a series of novel chemical entities [1].The pharmacotherapeutic potential of the African biodiversity has not yet beenrealized since much of the research carried out is fragmented with little or nofocus on drug discovery. African researchers are not only challenged by commu-nicable and non-communicable diseases encroaching upon the continent, butthey are also confronted with meagre nancial resources, poor infrastructure and non-accessibility to modern technological platforms which are crucial ele-ments for drug discovery. While the African continent is virtually considered asthe epicentre of pathogens endemicity, the African scienti c community is very poorly represented in setting the research agenda and priorities.The recent initiative of GA to streamline African research is undoubtedly a movein the right direction, provided that concerted and concomitant e orts are made to maintain a sound scienti c capacity in Africa. Such e orts are a major requirement for stopping the brain drain, further consolidate the African ethno-botanical heritage and building a critica l mass of young African scientists to gua- rantee ownership and sustainabili ty of long-term control programmes.

Prepared hydro-ethanolic extracts were characterized by HPLC-DAD and GC/MS analysis, then screened for their ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor(TNF) -induced IL-8 and IL-6 release, in human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1 and AGS), assessing the involvment of NF- B driven transcription. The antioxi- dant activity of the extracts was evaluated as well.After in-depth studies. They reduced in a concentration-dependent fashionthe cytokines release (IC 50s between 0.19 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL) and the NF- B driven transcription (IC 50s between 0.33 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL). They also sho- wed phenols (range: 8.96-32.96% mg gallic acid Eq/g of extract)assays. Chemical suggested that their secondary metabolites (androste-none, chlorogenic acid, pimaric acid, catechin, 4,5,7-trihydroxy flavanone, gingerol, shogaol, paradol and gallotannins) could potentially justify the biological properties observed.Results obtained from this study showed that the extracts reduce oxidativestress and in flammatory markers by scavenging free radicals and impairing NF- B signaling at gastric level. However, o ther molecular mechanisms cannot be excluded, and further studies are needed to better clarify their biologicalactivities.

Fractions containing N-[2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamide and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl glycolshowed a growth inhibition of g/mL and 37.28 g/mL respectively. Macrotermes bellicosus used as a traditional medicine could be a therapeutic option for infectious diseases. The study demonstrates thatmethylhydroquinone and benzohydroquinone are contributing to the antibacte-rial activity of Macrotermes bellicosus. Moreover, antibacterial activity could be observed in M. bellicosus extract fractions containing N-[2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamide and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylglycol.

The competitive and non- competitive inhibitory activity of active metabolites were further tested using amicrotiter plate. Metabolites were identi ed by their retention factor (Rf) value. Gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetin separated with the EMW eluent sys-tem expressed anti-tyrosinase activity similar to kojic acid. The prevalence of adark ring on the TLC plate was indicative of melanin formation while a clear spotindicating inhibition of tyrosinase. Active metabolites with Rf values di kojic acid were ed with the CEF eluent system. Furthermore, meta- bolites separated with the BEA eluent system were found not to inhibit tyrosi-nase. Active metabolites expressed a non-competitive behaviour with aK mequivalent to kojic acid. The ndings from the study reported an alternative usage of bush tea as a natural cosmeceutical extract.

Endophytic fungi hasbeen known to contribute the host plant adaptation to biotic (e.g. pathogens,herbivores) and abiotic (e.g. drought tolerance) stress factors [1, 2] by produ-cing unusual and bioactive secondary metabolites. Research has been underta-ken to investigate the bioactive natural products produced by the endophyticfungi isolated from Timorese medicinal plants. Antibiotic compounds and UVBprotector compounds have been isolated in high yield from the endophyticfungi Corynespora cassicola, Diaporthe melonis and Aspergillus flavus.C o r y n e s i d o - nes compounds had a strong inhibition to the growth of MRSA bacteria withMIC value of 16 \u00b5g/mL while flavomannin dimethyl ether inhibited the growth of streptococcus pneumonia with MIC value of 2 \u00b5g/mL. In addition, the UVBprotector compound, kojic acid was isolated in high quantities (10 gram) bysimple VLC fractionations from small scale fermentation. This nding con rmed the role of ecological factors in directing the speci c metabolites production by endophytic fungi for supporting the plant adaptions.

Animal Healthcare and Veterinary Phytotherapy IL VET-01 Phytochemicals in animal nutrition -their potential as functional feed Authors Zebeli Q1 Institute 1Institute of Animal Nutrition and Functional Plant Compounds, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, AustriaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399639 Phytochemicals are highly versatile in plants. They are also termed secondaryplants compounds, a terminology that might be outdated taking intoaccount the primary role metabolites for plant physiology, reproduction, andprotection. From the perspective of ecological mutuality between plants andanimals, these compounds are of crucial importance because they not onlyprotect but also serve as visual attraction for animals, especially herbivores,signaling nutritional and/or health-promoting values. In animal nutrition, thephytochemicals are commonly considered as phytogenic feed additiveswithout essential nutritional value as are the primary nutritive ingredients.However, the perception of the diet has changed during the last years bothin animal and human nutrition. One now expects that the diet delivers bothnutritive and health-promoting values. The knowledge of the last years sug-gests essential nutritive and health-promoting properties of many phytoche-micals, making them good functional feed candidates. Inclusion of suchfunctional feed ingredients in the animal diet may provide precursors for syn-thesis, protect the animal against oxidative stress, and, most importantly,many compounds enhance key metabolic pathways both at metagenomicsand host phenotypic level, being essential for animal nutrition and health.Using such examples, this talk will highlight the potentials of phytochemicalsas functional feeds, particularly focusing on the promotion of animal health. IL VET-02 Let feed and food be our medicine Authors Provenza F Institute Department of Wildland Resources, Utah State University DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399640 The health of livestock, humans, and environments is tied to plant (phytoche-mical) diversity. Health is enhanced when livestock forage on phytochemi-cally rich landscapes, is reduced when livestock forage on low-diversity pastures or eat high-grain rations in feedlots, and is greatly reduced for peo- ple who eat highly processed diets. The shift away from phytochemically andbiochemically rich plant and animal foods to processed foods enabled 2.1 bil-lion people to become overweight or obese and increased incidence of diet-related disease.Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that phytochemical richnessof herbivore diets enhances biochemical richness of meat and dairy, which islinked with human health. Among many roles they play in health, phytoche-micals in herbivore diets protect meat and dairy from protein oxidation andlipid peroxidation that cause low-grade systemic in flammation implicated in heart disease and cancer. Yet, epidemiological studies critical of red meat donot discriminate among meats from livestock fed high-grain rations as oppo-sed to phytochemically rich diets.While conventional agriculture adds 25% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regenerative agriculture can play a sizeable role in mitigating climate change.Of 80 ways to diminish these e ects, regenerative number one as ways to sequester GHG. We can enable human and planetary health by forsaking processed foodsand by sourcing, growing, and eating wholesome foods. We must learn weare members of nature 's communities. What we do to them, we do to oursel- ves; only by nurturing them can we nurture ourselves. Veterinary Phytopharmacology KL VET-01 Pharmacological and toxicological insights into veterinary phytotherapy Authors Mendel M Institute Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, 8 Ciszewskiego St., Warsaw02-786, Poland DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399641 Increasing interest of society in natural products, disappointing and dissatis-fying results of conventional therapy, as well as the \"One Health \"concept encouraged by authorities are only some of the causes of enhanced signi c- ance of phytotherapy in animals. Despite the long and well documented tra-dition of herbalism veterinary medicine, some pharmacological andtoxicological aspects must be carefully analyzed while considering the appli-cation of a plant-derived product into treatment protocol.In contrast to human medicine, veterinary medicine consists of various specieswith distinct di erences in anatomy and physiology. Consequently, safe and ecient phytotherapy is a challenge for many veterinarians. Signi cant inter- species di erences are re flected in diverse pharmacokinetics of phytomedici- nes. The complexity of gastrointestinal tract, various intensity of gut microor-ganisms 'activity and the activity of enzymatic systems, predominantly CYP450, are responsible for variable bioavailability of phytocompounds in ani-mals of di erent species. In cats, special attention must be paid to drugs requiring conjugation with active glucuronic acid since these animals areunable to perform this reaction. Similarly, urine excretion is species-dependentdue to various urine pH which may either facilitate or decrease elimination ofplant-origin substances and their metabolites. Another animal speci ca s p e c t of veterinary phytotherapy includes doping issue. Some herbal constituentsare not allowed in sport animals, some other may increase the concentrationof concurrently applied drugs and cause a positive result of anti-doping tes-ting. Herb -drug and herb-nutrients interactions, as well as unconscious use of counterfeit phytomedicines are other matters to discuss. Altogether, only rati-onal phytotherapy guarantees the safety and e ectiveness people expect.

After absorption from the intes- tine, thymol enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues. We foundsignicant correlation between thymol levels in plasma and feed and duodenal wall, which points to the e cient thymol absorption from the digestive tract into circulation. Erythrocytes play a crucial role in the distribution of circulatingpolyphenols due to binding to their surface and being able to act like depots.That is why the real thymol concentration in blood could be higher than it wasfound in plasma. Thyme oil activity and signi cantly decreased malondialdehyde as a product of lipid peroxidation in plasma which points to modulation of antioxidant enzymesactivity and improvement of the oxidative stability. Obtained the lowest thymolconcentrations in muscle (139 ng/g DM) in comparison with plasma (854 ng/mL), liver (568 ng/g DM) and kidney (5541 ng/g DM) could be due to low thy-mol penetration or high activity of e ux transporters, hence insu cient to aect antioxidant defence system. In conclusion, thymol e ectiveness depends on its systemic availability for the targeted organ.

The herbal prepa-rations were dosed 2g/kg body weight (BW)/day. Fasting and postprandialblood parameters were assessed after control period, rst-, and second week of phytotherapy period. The BW was measured weekly and a general exami-nation was carried out two times per week. The BW decreased 1.4% and 0.8% after two weeks of treatment with A. vera (p=0,001) and C. sativum (p=0,112), respectively. Hemogram and blood chemistry revealed no impactof herbal preparations.

Authors Provenza F Institute Department of Wildland Resources, Utah State University DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399647 To determine if livestock can self-medicate, we rst showed that sheep fed high-grain diets ingest sodium bicarbonate or bentonite, substances that atte-nuate acidosis and restore acid-base balance. We then showed that sheep andgoats regulate intake of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which alleviates the aversiveeects of consuming high-tannin diets, in accord with the amount of tannin in their diet. Finally, we showed that sheep ingest dicalcium phosphate to coun-teract foods high in oxalic acid. To learn whether sheep make multiple illness-medicine associations, we conditioned sheep to use three medicines -bento- nite, PEG, and dicalcium phosphate -and then o ered them grain or food with tannins or food with oxalic acid and gave them access to the three medici-nes. Sheep chose the medicine that recti ed the malady. Sheep and goats infected with internal parasites eat more tannin-rich foragethan non-infected animals. As parasite loads increase, they increase theirintake of plants with tannins, which decreases parasite loads. Livestock areless inclined to self-medicate when they are provided with anti-parasiticdrugs. Parasitized sheep reduce intake of high-tannin food when their para-site infection is terminated with ivermectin. Likewise, goats treated withanthelmintic drugs eat less tannin-containing heather than do goats infectedwith internal parasites.Collectively, these ndings show livestock self-medicate, even after 10,000 years of domestication. Biochemically mediated flavor-feedback associations, where cells and organ systems alter liking for foods as a function of needs,enable livestock to self-medicate. To do so, however, livestock must haveaccess to phytochemically rich foods and learn to use them. ISL VET-03 Medicinal diet of Tibetan macaques in Southern China Authors Human MA Institute Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, JapanDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399648 Dietary selection is important to assure the balance of nutrients for energy,growth, maintenance, and reproduction. The innate response of an animalis to avoid eating plants with toxic secondary metabolites, but these pro-perties can be medicinal when ingested in appropriate amounts. It is propo-sed that under physical conditions that require direct intervention (healthmaintenance or self-medication), animals ingest even such toxic plants fortheir medicinal bene ts to regain health homeostasis. Previous studies on primate plant food selection have found that 15~25% of the items in theirdiet could be classi ed as 'medicinal food '(plants with bioactive, physiology modifying properties). Here we focus on identifying prospective medicinalfoods in the diet, in order to investigate the potential properties and pos-sible roles of such items for a wild group of Tibetan macaques (Macaca thi- betana) at Mt. Huangshan, Anhui Province, China. Using a 50 species food list of this group, a pharmacological database search was conducted. Weidenti ed 12 species (24%) with signi cant pharmacological potential. Across the 12-month study, medicinal foods accounted for 18~23% of thetotal diet in any one season. The reported activities in these items includedanti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-rheumatic, neuroprotective, osteoprotec-tive, reproductive stimulant and wound others. While theactual medicinal bene ts to macaques gained from ingesting these plants are yet unknown, based on the available evidence for their parasite infec-tion ecology, reproductive behavior and possible stress reduction, wehypothesize on the possible scope of self-medication in Tibetan macaques, and suggest future avenues for research.

This is the case for early metabolite identi cation on taxonomical consistency, chemotaxonomical and chemical space exploration.Such protocols allow highlighting NPs of interest in crude extracts, and targettheir solation in the sub mg range with e cient optimised high resolution preparative approaches for full structure and bioactivity assessment [4].We performed a massive metabolite pro ling on a biodiverse set of 1,600 extracts (156 families, 533 genera, 783 species) from the plant part library ofPierre Fabre Laboratories made available through a collaboration. After dere-plication, individual clusters were examined and we were able to highlight acluster with several possible new analogues of -sesquiterpene pyridinic alka- loids, which was further studied.Selected species was subjected to a straightforward one-step isolation proce-dure using a gradient transfer combined with a dry-load injection of the sam-ple at a semi-preparative HPLC scale. This approach allowed the targeted isolation of a series of 14 original dihydro- -agarofuran sesquiterpene alka- loid derivatives, which were fully characterized by 2D NMR and HRMS.Our work flow is able to quickly spot possible new NPs from a large and che- modiverse collection of plants.

Pil\u00e1t, signi cantly inhibited the fat accumulation in C. elegans at 10 g/mL, without having a negative e ect on the nematodes 'lifespan and was therefore selected for further mycochemical investigations. The extract was separated viaflash chromatography into 37 micro-fractions with quantitative variances of constituents over several consecutive fractions. The e ect on fat accu- mulation was determined for each fraction and the increases anddecreases of bioactivity were correlated with the fractions ' 1HN M R spectra following a recently developed biochemometric approach named ELINA (Eliciting Nature 's Activities) [3].

SL YRW-03 Feature-based molecular networking and network annotation propagation applied to naturalantiviral compound research from 10.1055/s-0039-3399652 In an e of Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV), a systematic study with 311 extracts from tropicalEuphorbiaceae species was performed in a which bark extracts exhibited signi cant anti-CHIKV activities, were rst investigated. Following a classical bio-guided isolation work flow, more than 20 new diterpenes were characterized but none of them showed signi cant antiviral activity. [1]To address this issue, a Feature-Based Molecular Network (FBMN) was builtfrom the LC-MS 2data acquired from the chromatographic fractions of both extracts. FBMN is a computational method that bridges data processing toolsfor LC-MS 2and molecular networking (MN) analysis on GNPS [2]. Then the Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) work flow that improve in silico frag- mentation candidate structure ranking using spectral networks to propagateinformation from spectral library matching, allowed highly reliable identi ca- tion of phorbol analogues. Those compounds present in trace amounts inboth extracts, provides a plausible explanation for the loss of the biological activity observed during the bioassay-guided isolation procedure [3]. In a second study, a bioactive prioritization approach based on the mergingof taxonomical and bioassays data over the MN built from the initial set ofEuphorbiaceae extracts led to the targeted isolation and characterization ofseveral dual inhibitors from Codiaeum peltatum [4]. Both studies exemplify how MN and recent advances in molecular annotation can be implementedin phytochemical studies to understand drawbacks and improve the bioactivecompound discovery process.

Phenanthrenes have become of great interest in thelast 20 years because of their wide-range of structural antiprolifera- tive are a unique, relatively oxidized class of flavonoids. They bear a non-saturated B-ring, and a hydroxyl group is connected through C-1 . These flavonoid analogues with a para-quinol ring are described in the literature with considerable antiproliferative activities [2].The aim of our work was to merge the characteristics of the mentionedmetabolites, according to the structural similarities of phenanthrenesandflavonoids. As juncuenin B contains phenolic hydroxyl groups, during oxidation reactions formation of p-quinol ring containing semisynthetic derivatives were expected. To accomplish these reactions, organic oxidi-zing agents, namely PIFA ([bis(tri fluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene) and under di erent reaction condi- tions.

GS were prepared by the thin layer evaporation method and characterized by Light Scattering techniques, determi-ning average diameter (about 60 nm), polydispersity index ( 0.2) and -poten- tial (-30 mV). From the morphological observation by transmission electron microscope, GS appeared as small vesicl es with several lamellae and a spherical shape. Moreover, the EO encapsulation e ciency inside the GS, in terms of citral and-caryophyllene, obtained by HPLC-DAD, was 63 % and 76 % respectively and the EO release, by the dialysis bag method, was very low ( 15% of citral) within 24h. The same instruments and analytical techniques were adopted tomonitor the GS long-term stability unt il 4 months and no relevant changes were observed in the chemical-physical parameters. Successively, GS were tes-ted with an in vitro antiviral assay against the HSV-1/strain vCLIDA61. From these studies, the antiviral activity of loaded-EO was found to be comparable tofree-EO, for high concentrations of EO. Hence, at present, GS seems to be a pro-mising tool in order to administer the EO and replace the conventional anti-her-petic drugs, when drug-resistance forms take place.

Authors Sapkota DenmarkDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399655 Plants may utilize bioactive chemical compounds which exude from theirroot to shape their associated bene cial microorganism in the rhizosphere to acquire resistance against pathogen infection ( Fig. 1 ). However, the underlying mechanism regulating this interaction has been poorly elucida-ted. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional role of root exudate (from di erent host genotypes) in mediating belowground indirect plant defence. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlyingplant interaction with health-promoting microorganism, Arabidopsis tha- liana (Col-0 and Ler-0 accessions) were grown for three weeks in eld soil (non-sterile). Subsequently, the roots were exposed to Fusarium oxysporum matthioli (FOM). Sampling was done every ve days after the infection for 25 days. The collected samples were subjected to both targeted (aliphaticand indole glucosinolates, plant hormones, and mycotoxins) and untarge-ted analysis and GC-TOF/MS platforms well asmetabarcoding (Illumina of the plantsdisplayed that the Col-0 accessions had developed a resistance to FOMexposure whereas the Ler-0 ecotype was susceptible. The disease progres-sion was also evaluated on a molecular level and resulted in the identi ca- tion of beauvericin in both root and shoot tissues of the susceptible plantswhich likely was associated with promoting pathogenicity in FOM.

Chemotherapy with benznidazole or nifurti-mox is e ective when administered in the acute stage but the e cacy rapidly decreases in the chronic phase and these drugs become toxic [1]. Interven-tion with botanical drugs seems to be a possible alternative against parasiticdiseases, especially among rural communities where triatomine bugs stillinfect people [2]. However, a systematic analysis to challenge this hypothesisis lacking. We performed a one-year ethnobotanical/pharmacological eld- work among indigenous groups in the Bolivian Chaco where the Chagasdisease is hyperendemic. Our hypothesis was that ethnopharmacologicallyinspired plant extract libraries show a higher degree of speci c antitrypano- somal activities than a comprehensive Dioscoroides medicinal plant extractlibrary without association to trypanosomiasis. To that aim, we have establis-hed a BSL3* lab in Bern to assess selective toxicity towards the di erent sta- ges of the parasite during host infection and in comparison, with T. brucei and mammalian host cells. So far, more than 750 plant taxa were assessed.Few plants have been subjected to bioactivity-guided isolation using LC-MSand structure elucidation. Based on our most active clusters we found naph-thalene, sesquiterpene lactones and anthraquinones. A library of 20 anthra-quinones was tested. Some of the anthraquinone derivatives showed nMpotencies in the infection assay but did not exhibit antitrypanosomal activityon the insect stage, indicating a stage-dependent mechanism of action spe-cic to the host-parasite interaction.

Therefore, the CHC pro le can be adjusted by the metapleural gland and Dufour 's gland. In leafcutter- bacterialike Pseudonocardia inhabiting the pro le may in flu- ence the growth of the bacteria. To investigate the impact of CHCs in thissymbiosis we analyzed the CHC pro les of three di erent species of leaf- cutter ants containing two genera, Atta and Acromyrmex , by GC-EI-MS. These results were compared with CHC pro les of the closely related ant Messor aciculatus and the tropic ant Polyrhachis dives . Our research could show high quantitative and qualitative di erences in the CHC pro le of the investigated ants. The CHC pro les of all leafcutter ants contained more amides like tetradecanamide, hexadecanamide and hexadecenamide.The between the two erent genera of leafcutter ants living in symbiosis with Pseudonocardia and the di erence of those ants to the tropic Polyrhachis and the closely related Messor suggests an impact of the identi ed compounds on the symbiosis. Our ndings allowed an opti- mization of growth media for leafcutter ant associated, antimicrobial pro-ducing bacteria by testing di erent CHC and chitin concentrations, dierent temperature conditions and pH values. The comparison of 36 growing conditions pointed out that the best growth for Pseudonocardia appeared at pH 7, 28\u00b0C with 2 % chitin and addition of tetradecanamide,hexadecanamide, hexadecenamide and their corresponding acids.

Both of them are considered as some of the chemical constituents rele-vant to the biological activity of olive oil, leading to a global upsurge in theinvestigation of their diverse health promoting and disease preventing abili-ties, including several chronic diseases, mainly cardiovascular and neurodege-nerative disorders, and cancer. Moreover, a large body of evidence suggeststhat the potential biological e ects of edible phenolic compounds in the human body are partly consequence of their biotransformation by the colon microbiota.Aiming towards a detailed investigation into the absorption, metabolism and micro flora-dependent transformation of HT, and its conjugated form, OL, and within the framework of the international MediHealth project, the GIDM-Colon Model was applied. The aforementioned model is an optimized, valida-tedin vitro continuous flow dialysis system, simulating the absorption from lumen to mucosa; followed by the colon phase using pooled human faecalsuspensions, which mimics the physiological conditions during human gast-rointestinal digestion [1].

However, lack of information regar-ding transcription factors (TFs) hinders understanding of the regulationof gene expression relevant for the biosynthesis of these secondarymetabolites.Therefore, we decided to capture the transcriptome and to exploit next-generation sequencing approach for the prediction of TFs in R. marginata . In- depth transcriptomic analysis revealed a total number of 3449 unigenes thathave potential binding sites for 1085 transcription factors (TF) from 39 fami-lies. Moreover, comparative analysis from related moss species showed thatsix TF families like BSD, CSD, DbpA, FHA, TIG had uniquely pre-dicted in R. marginata. On the other hand, we could not nd any target site from B3 and trihelix TF families which might have been due to evolutionarycontraction. In addition, 156 TFs from MYB (66) bZIP (39) AP2/ERF (9/22)NAC (10) bHLH (8) DOF (2) that are primarily involved in regulating thesecondary metabolism also predicted.To sum it up, it is the rst ever micro transcriptomic study predicting the TFs inR. marginata . However, further functional characterization of TFs especially for the secondary metabolism and terpenoid biosynthesis is vital to unrave-ling the expression of gene regulation.

Economic Adulteration of Botanical Ingredients Abstracts ISL EA-01 Preventing adulteration and fraud in botanical ingredients in the international marketplace: the ABC-AHP-NCNPR BotanicalAdulterants Prevention Program Authors Beach, VA University, MS Pharmacopoeia, Scotts Valley, CA 95067, USADOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399662 The global market for herbal medicines, dietary and food supplements, andother botanically-based natural products has increased, as have con rmed reports of economically motivated adulteration of botanical raw materials,extracts, essential oils with undisclosed, non-authentic, lower-cost ingre- dients. These ingredients are used -sometimes by unwitting manufacturers -innished botanical-based consumer products, reducing the activity and expected e cacy of these products, and, in some cases crea- ting potential safety problems.Detailed reviews on adulteration of speci c botanical ingredients are currently being compiled in a series of publications by an independentconsortium of nonpro t organizations consisting of the American Bota- nical Council (ABC), the American H erbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), and the National Center for Natural Product Research (NCNPR) at the Uni-versity of Mississippi. The ABC-AHP-NCNPR Botanical Adulterants Pre-vention Program (BAPP) is an international educational program thathas been supported and endorsed by over 200 botanical industry com-panies, third-party analytical laboratories, nonpro t professional organi- zations, industry trade associations, research centers, and others. As ofJuly 2019, BAPP has published a total of 51 extensively peer-revieweddocuments. These include Bulletins con rming adulteration of speci c ingredients and Laboratory Guidance Documents in which laboratoryanalytical methods are evaluated for their ability to detect the types ofconrmed adulteration currently pres ent in the marketplace. This pre- sentation will give an overview of recent cases of adulteration andBAPP 'seorts to help prevent adulteration and fraud by educating the herb industry, researchers, and regulators via documents available onBAPP 's free-access website at http://cm s.herbalgram.org/BAP/index. html. ISL EA-02 Combining analytical tools to identify adulteration: some practical examples Authors Bilia AR1 Institute 1Department of Chemistry, Univesrity of Florence, via Ugo Schi 6, Florence, ItalyDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399663 The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) is the legal and scienti c reference for the quality control of medicines, including herbal drugs (HDs) and theirpreparations (HDPs). Typically, quality is de ned using markers or active con- stituents by the means of HPTLC, HPLC, GC. Nevertheless, substitution oradulteration of HDs and HDPs either intentionally, e.g. motivated by thedesire to maximize nancial gains, or unintentionally, e.g. by clerical errors or lack of knowledge, is not a rare occurrence and can have tragicconsequences.Diverse analytical methods including DNA ngerprinting, Nuclear Mag- netic Resonance (NMR), Near InfraRed (NIR) and (bio)sensors can bevery useful as integrative/ alternative analytical methods. Identi cation of plants at the species level can be successfully based on genome-based methods, using DNA barcodes, the nucleotide sequence of a shortDNA fragment, as in the case of di erent species of goji berry. NMR can provide direct NMR ngerprint determination (complete assignment of the signals by 1D and 2D experiments), and fully characterize di erent commercial extracts of ginkgo or even complex HDPs mixtures. NIRspectroscopy is a fast qualitative and quantitative analytical method,getting knowledge about substitution of plant species, i.e. star anise andthe neurotoxic Japanese star anise, Stephania tetrandra and the nephroto- xicAristolochia fangchi . Finally, chemical and biological sensors represent one of the most interesting analytical tool because of the versatility ofthe recognition element able to recognize the presence of unde ned DNA intercalating constituents or speci c classes of metabolites could be related to the substitution or adulteration [1, 2].

Greater sophistication in analytical techniques, including genetics, has allowed for greater levels of exactness in di erentiating species than was historically possible. However, the medicinal plant trade has not kept up with thisincreasing level of sophistication, often using multiple species as themedicinal article of trade. Some of these interchangeably used speciesare codi ed in pharmacopoeias internationally, others are not. Some spe- cies are readily identi able as genuine articles of trade whereas botanical specicity may be elusive or questionable. Pharmacopoeias provide the suite of identity, purity, and quality tests, that when complied with, givesa high level of con dence for ensuring an authentic botanical drug of trade, but may lack botanical preciseness. The occurrence of hybrids rai-ses additional challenges that may or may not result in clinically relevantchanges in the botanical drug.Presented are examples of closely related species, some of which can bereadily identi ed as authentic articles of medicinal trade according to pharmacopoeial identity tests but may not be identi ed with 100% bota- nical speci city.

ISL EA-06 The truth behind herbal products: how HPTLC can herbal industry detect Scienti 28401, Wilmington, NC USADOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399665 Adulteration of herbal drugs, ingredients and products is a growing concernof industry, regulators and consumers worldwide. The last few years haveseen an increase in negative press reports targeting the herbal industry. Afamous example was the 2015 case of the New York State Attorney Generalwho launched his own investigation of the quality of herbal products sold asdietary supplements. Although the validity of the study was questioned, suchcase raised several discussions regarding conformity of herbal ingredientsand products with speci cations and the issue of adulteration. Our group has participated in several market surveys looking at black cohosh,ginkgo, St. John 's wort, milk thistle and echinacea products by HPTLC [1, 2, 3]. In most of these cases, we found a signi cant number of samples either adulterated or not in full compliance with their labels.This presentation will illustrate the role of HPTLC in ensuring quality herbaldrugs, ingredients and products in a simple and pragmatic way. HPTLC is notonly an identity tool, but also is used to determine purity and potency of theinvestigated material. The concept of \"comprehensive HPTLC ngerprinting \" combines visual image data and quantitative information that becomes avai-lable, when such data are converted into peak pro les. This information comes at no extra cost. References [1] Frommenwiler DA, Sudberg S, Sharaf MHM, Bzhelyansky A, Lucas B, Reich E. St. John 's wort versus counterfeit St. John 's wort: An HPTLC study.

Often, adulteration is carried out for nancial gain (economically motivated adulteration), where raw materials are intentionally substituted or diluted with undisclosed lower-qua-lity ingredients. This represents a challenge to the global botanical medicinemarketplace and, in some cases, impacts consumer safety. The AmericanBotanical Council (ABC), the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (AHP), and theNational Center for Natural Product Research (NCNPR) at the University ofMississippi have initiated the ABC-AHP-NCNPR Botanical Adulterants Pro-gram, a program to educate members of the herbal and dietary supplementindustry about ingredient and product adulteration.The chemically complex nature of botanically-derived ingredients calls forunique quality control processes. Appropriate testing for identity and authen-ticity of botanical materials is a universal requirement in countries aroundthe world. However, unscrupulous suppliers often take advantage of a lack ofspecicity in test methods used to con rm the identity of a botanical ingre- dient by providing materials that comply with these identity tests even ifthey do not correspond to the material declared on the label.

ISL EA-08 The 2019 curcumin crisis in Italy: what we know so far, and early lessons Authors Bucchini L1 Institute 1Hylobates Consulting srl, Via Tarsia 61, Rome, Italy DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399667 On May 10, 2019, the Italian Ministry of Health publicly announced that 4cases of acute cholestatic non-viral hepatitis had been reported, and associa-ted with the consumption of food supplements. Investigators suspected acausal association with curcumin obtained from turmeric ( Curcuma longa L.). By July, 21 cases had been reported by health authorities, involving 22 di e- rent food supplements, mostly by Italian brands. A signi cant proportion of products also included piperine as ingredient; it has also been reported thatseveral products were adulterated with synthetic curcumin, presented toconsumers as natural. Few cases of acute non-viral hepatitis associated withcurcumin had been reported in the US, Australia and, apparently, Japan. Theaim of the presentation is to summarize available information on the case-series, and in the literature; to report on the risk assessment and riskmanagement decisions in Italy, and being debated in other Member States;to reflect on early lessons, particularly in reference to adulteration. Surveil- lance bias may have contributed to the clustering of cases, but risks to indivi-duals with liver or biliary disease or undergoing medicinal therapy could havebeen anticipated. Both authorities and industry have shown to be only par-tially prepared to investigate and address case-reports. While synthetic cur- cumin is not believed to be the cause of the case-series at this stage, its safety is untested, and its labeling not appropriate. In this case, authoritiesand industry have become aware of the challenge posed by adulteration, butstruggle to respond in an e ective and decisive manner. ISL EA-09 Authentic and non-adulterated botanical ingredients in an unethical market situation. Full traceability, high quality production and exhaustiveanalytical control Authors Mul\u00e0 A1, Adulteration and fraud are a menace to the botanical ingredients sector andgenerate growing demand for transparency for all the processes associatedwith production [1,2]. Manufacturers cannot ultimately avoid market scrutiny. Full traceability of the entire process is key, starting with the plant material from cultivated or wild sources, and including quality and sustainability criteria.The multilayer set of control methods of plant material starts with the taxo-nomic and phytochemical identity, continues with purity controls, includingcontaminants, and ends with the determination of active or marker com-pounds. Besides classical methods, modern techniques such as metabolomicevaluations and DNA barcoding should be employed. These methods allow amore robust ingredient identi cation and lower instances of adulteration. The subsequent physical and chemical production processes, and the set ofspecications and control methods, will nally determine the quality and authenticity of the botanical ingredient.

Saw Palmetto Lipidic Sterolic Extract (SPE), made from Serenoa repens berries, is the most expensive oil of the pharmaceutical and health food market,hence, its adulteration is frequent. Substitution of the saw palmetto berrywith fruit from closely-related palm species, dilution of products with exhaus-tively extracted berry powder, the use of unripe berries, the addition of vege-table oils to extracts, and/or full substitution of SPE with other lower-costvegetable or animal oils, have all been detected and documented byEuromed 3. Wide variation of fatty acid content in authentic and adulterated saw palmetto extracts can explain di erences in clinical trial outcomes and threaten the market reputation of the extract.

Authors de Vaumas R1 Institute Genay, FranceDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399669 In controlling the supply chain of botanical raw materials, extracts and otherdietary ingredients, there are di erent challenges that must be addressed compared to other industries, especially in the traceability and sustainabilityof plant sources. However, there are also universal principles that may apply:testing of starting materials, intermediates and nished products for identity, contamination and potency.Among many testing techniques, the determination and quanti cation of chemical constituents of herbs or herbal products is of tremendous valuebeyond meeting regulatory requirements. Chromatographic techniques havebeen available for years to address these needs, whether the purpose ismaterial identi cation, potency assurance, or the detection of contamination and adulteration.Because the results of chromatographic techniques are calculated directly against the reference standards chosen, these reference standards have direct impact on the ability to accurately assess the safety, quality, andpotency of the raw materials and nished products that have been tested. It is critical that companies understand and incorporate reference standards aspart of their increased commitment to valid, t for purpose product testing as required by 21CFR 111.320 (a-b).As industry companies work to develop unassailable testing programs, andreference standards are increasingly understood to be a vital component ofherbal product testing, the sourcing of quality reference standards is asimportant as increased commitment to sourcing quality ingredients.

To address theselimitations and make the NCI 's Natural Products Repository more amenable to HTS, we have initiated the prefractionation of extracts using an automa- ted, high-throughput robotics platform capable of generating a library of1,000,000 partially puri ed extracts. The talk will discuss this and other mechanisms to increase the utility of the NCI Natural Products Repository incancer-related drug discovery. PL-02 Digitizing historical collections of natural products to further explore the monoterpene indole alkaloids nitrogen-containing plant-derived natural products composed of more than 3000members.[1] This natural product class is found in hundreds of plant species from the Apocynaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, Icacinaceae, Nyssaceae, andGelsemiaceae plant families. Throughout the six past decades, the structuralintricacies and biological activities of these molecules have captured the inte-rest of many researchers all over the world.As part of our continuing interest in MIA chemistry, we recently implementedan in-house MS/MS database, constituted of a cumulative collection of alka-loids from the global natural products research community. These endeavorsled to the construction of the largest MS/MS dataset of MIAs to date, that wenamed: Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids DataBase (MIADB).[2] Thanks to thisdatabase, we developed a streamlined molecular networking dereplicationpipeline directed toward the reinvestigation of previously studied MIA-contai-ning plants. This pipeline allowed to prioritize the isolation work flow toward new alkaloids bearing unprecedented carbon skeleton and interesting biolo-gical activities. This presentation is intended to describe the most signi cant results gleaned from the reinvestigation of several forgotten plants by thisnew generation of sophisticated tools.

PL-03 Integrative analysis of bioactive compounds from frogs, plants and microorganisms from theBrazilian biodiversity Authors Brunetti A1,2, Lopes NP1,2 Institute 1NPPNS, Juan Bidau \"(CONICET-UNaM), Posadas, Misiones, Argentina DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399673 Living organisms have been used as source for di erent traditional medicines from several ethnic groups since antiquity. In recent years, one of the greatestchallenges within the eld of natural products is to understand its functioning for future rational applications. Mass s pectrometry methodologies are impor- tant strategies for investigating the complex chemistry of natural products.During the last years, the increasing po wer of informatics for data analysis has increased our capacity to inventory many biological systems [1]. In our labora- tory, for instance, we have investigated neuroactive and antimicrobial com- pounds from skin secretions of anuran amphibians [2]. We have found thatsome components of the rich secretion can be associated with chemical com-munication between frogs at intra and interspeci c levels [2, 3]. In this talk we will present and discuss the potential relevance of plants and bacteria as a sourceof chemical signals in frogs, which represent one component of the vast BrazilianBiodiversity.

PL-04 Will perplexity prevail natural products research? Authors Pauli GF1 Institute 1Center for Natural Product Technologies (CENAPT), Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences (PCRPS), and Institutefor Tuberculosis Research (ITR), College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois atChicago (UIC), 60612, Chicago, IL, U.S.A. DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399674 The inherently complexity of bioactive natural products (NPs) requires newanalytical technology, trans-disciplinary approaches, and an integrative phar-macognosy approach for advancement. Recent research reveals that comple-xity comes in three main flavors: obvious, less obvious , and residual . While analytical chemistry and (bio)synthetic biology progress renders chemodiver-sity an obvious complexity , other chemistry aspects are less obvious : mechanis- tic explanations for postulated \"botanical SARs seeds 's permutations outstrip capabilities, perplexity prevails over complexity when of promising anti-TB leads exemplify less obvious complexity . Despite being an obvious complexity , impurity ranks high among factors that confound NP research. Searches for bioactives (phytoestrogens, antimicrobials) M.tb. \"lead \"potential was a perple- xing demonstration of residual complexity . Apparent simplicity of hyper-popu- lar NPs hide the less obvious and residual complexity of their promiscuous properties. Well-founded rationales that designate NPs such as curcumin asinvalid/improbable panaceas (IMPs) are less complex than the impact of basic tenets of pharmacognosy, scienti c publishing, or marketing practices. Advertised globally, the therapeutic potentials ascribed to IMPs are in perple-xing contrast to the rigor of available e cacy evaluations. The present contri- bution structures the three complexity flavors and identi es approaches for overcoming perplexity in NP research. PL-05 The evolution of animal self-medication and lessons for the development of medicine and new medicines Authors Human MA1 Institute 1Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, 41-2 Kanrin, Inuyama, JapanDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399675 Parasites, viruses and other pathogens cause a variety of diseases that a ect the behavior and reproductive tness of an individual. While the study of animal self-medication as a science is relatively new, to date, research has clas-sied health maintenance and self-medicative behaviors into four levels: 1) optimal avoidance or reduction of disease transmission: 2) the dietary selec-tion of items with a preventative or health maintenance a ect: 3) ingestion of a substance for the curative treatment of a disease or the symptoms thereof:and 4) external application of a substance to the body for the treatment orcontrol of disease bearing insects. Of any species studied thus far, chimpan- zees have provided the most details for level 2 and 3 behaviors, exempli ed by such behaviors as bitter pith chewing and whole leaf swallowing used inresponse to parasite infection [1, 2]. This presentation will review the progressto date in primates, and compare these strategies with examples from otherspecies to illustrate the wide and deep evolutionary origins of self-medicationin the animal kingdom and show how this bio-rational approach can aid in thesearch for new natural plant compounds and has found new uses for wellknown compounds in human and livestock health care.

Here we summarise our current understandingof the chemistry and mechanism of action of the compound, and provideresults from recently completed veterinary (Phase III) and human (Phase I/II)clinical trials.Tigilanol tiglate has a multi-factorial mechanism of action. A single intratu-moural injection (1) induces a rapid, highly localised and transient in flamma- tory response surrounding the tumour mass, (2) signi cantly increases permeability of the tumour endothelium, and (3) causes rapidtumour cell death by oncosis. In combination, these result in tumour hae-morrhagic necrosis, eschar formation and complete tumour destruction wit-hin 4 to 14 days.

The com-pound also induces changes in cytokine signalling and gene expression thatpromote wound healing following tumour destruction.In a Phase III fully-randomised, controlled and blinded veterinary clinic trial, asingle treatment with tigilanol tiglate resulted in complete and enduringtumour destruction in more than 75% of canine patients with mast celltumours. In a clinical Phase I/II human dose-escalation study, maximum toler-ated dose was not reached and signs of e cacy were observed in 9 tumour types, including complete response in 4 patients.

PL-07 GPCR-targeted drug discovery Authors Xie X1 Institute 1Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, ChinaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399677 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as 7 transmembranereceptors, are the largest family of cell surface receptors. They are invol-ved in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes and arethe largest family of druggable targets. Our group is interested in the bio-logical functions of GPCRs and their roles in major diseases includingautoimmune disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases andetc. In addition to the mechanism study, we also screen and developdrugs targeting GPCRs. Natural compounds may exert their e ect by tar- geting GPCRs.For example, Herbal-based food supplement is widely used to treat obesity.Among them, the Hoodia gordonii (Asclepiadaceae) supplements are extre- mely popular. The African cactiform has been used for thousands of years byXhomani Bushmen as an anorexant during hunting trips and has been propo-sed as a new agent for the management of body weight. However, the trueactive components and molecular targets of Hoodia remain unclear. We have demonstrated that Gordonoside F, a steroid glycoside isolated from Hoodia gordonii P57, GPR119, a receptor homeostasis, and leads to increasedinsulin secretion and reduced food intake. These results not only demonst-rate that the activation of GPR119 receptor is an important mechanismunderlying Hoodia gordonii 's therapeutic e ect, but also suggest that Gordo- noside F or its congeners could be developed into new drugs in treatingmetabolic disorders. PL-08 The Amaryllidaceae alkaloid Authors R1 Institute 1Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Faculty of Biochemistry, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Goethe University Frankfurt, 10.1055/s-0039-3399678 Narciclasine is an isocarbostyril alkaloid that was rst isolated from Narcissus species (Amaryllidaceae) more than 50 years ago. In the last decades, narcicla-sine attracted huge attention due to its high potency as anti-tumor com-pound. However, beyond cancer research, knowledge on the pharmacologicalactivity of narciclasine is largely lacking. Only few studies reported about ananti-in flammatory potential of the alkaloid. Since both solid tumor growth and inflammation strongly depend on activation processes of vascular endothelialcells (ECs), we hypothesized that narciclasine might interfere with signaling pathways that regulate two crucial pathophysiological functions of ECs: theformation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the interaction of leukocy-tes with ECs (extravasation and tissue in ltration). Indeed, by using a battery of both in vitro and in vivo models, we showed that narciclasine strongly inhi- bits angiogenic processes as well as leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction.Most interestingly, we were able to elucidate the molecular mechanisms invol-ved in these pharmacological activities: In human ECs, narciclasine blocked de novo protein biosynthesis by approx. 50% without inducing considerable cyto- toxicity.

PL-09 The application of classic and modern pharmacognosy in monographing African traditional medicines -a S1, Vermaak 1Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and SAMRC Herbal Drugs Research Unit, Faculty of Science, Tshwane University of Technology, Privatebag X680, Pretoria 0001, Pretoria, South AfricaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399679 Southern Africa harbours a unique flora comprising of over 24 000 species of flowering plants. Woven within this tapestry of botanical diversity is the tradi- tional use of indigenous plants as ethnomedicines. Developing o cial mono- graphs, establishing a national repository of botanical standards, andproducing validated analytical methods is a fundamentally important prere-quisite to encourage research and commercialisation of Africa 's medicinal flora. Furthermore, the availability of reference standards, analytical methods and comprehensive monographs would be highly bene cial to the regulator, consumer and nascent industries. The unfortunate underrepresentation ofpharmacognosy in the curricula of many pharmacy schools has left a void ofexpertise, which has hampered the development of a comprehensive herbalPharmacopoeia. A further challenge involves the inherent complexity ofmedicinal plants, exacerbated by extensive chemotypic variation. Chemicalngerprinting is a crucial component in characterising plant material and requires a dedicated approach to develop analytical methods for the pro ling of complex herbal extracts. Funding from the National Research Foundation(NRF/DST SARChI Initiative) and the South African Medical Research Councilhas catalysed initiatives at the Tshwane University of Technology to developherbal monographs that aid in the identi cation and quality control of impor- tant South African herbal medicines. Selected examples will be presented to illustrate the daunting work flow, which includes extensive sampling, the development of analytical methods to pro le volatile and non-volatile com- pounds using GC-MS and LC-MS, HPTLC, vibrational spectroscopy, to isolate biomarkers. The powerfultandem application of analytical chemistry and chemometric modelling willbe highlighted. Developing comprehensive species monographs requires amultidisciplinary collaborative e ort which will inevitably contribute to the safety, e cacy and quality of African Traditional Medicines and commercial herbal formulations.

Endocannabinoids have evol- ved early in evolution, prior to the classic mammalian cannabinoidreceptors CB1 and CB2 [1] and seem to play important functions also inlower organisms [2, 3]. Currently, only two very distant plant taxa areknown to exert psychoactive e ects [4], but numerous non-psychoactive endocannabinoid system modulating naturalproducts exist. In this lecture, I will discuss the biochemical convergenceand how lipids from plants can inspire probe design and help to identifynew biochemical pathways in mammals and how this can foster transla-tional research. Results from an ongoing comprehensive \"phylo-activity \" screening program of plant extract libraries will highpoint the potentiallink between nutrition and the endocannabinoid system [5], warrantinga more pharmacological inquiry into the relevance of plant secondarymetabolites for human health.

It isestimated that over 90% of the European population struggle with this disor-der at some point of their lives [1] and approximately 15% of the world popu-lation invest in skin lightening cosmetics [2]. The primary target of skinlightening agents is tyrosinase (EC 1.14.14.1), a metaloenzyme catalyzingrate-limiting rst two steps of melanogenesis - the convertion to arbutin are examples of tyrosinase inhibitors isolated from natural sourcesthat are commonly used in skin whitening cosmetics. However, due to theirpoor e cacy in vivo , low formulation stability and possible adverse e ects novel cosmetic ingredients preventing and reducing hyperpigmentation areneeded [5].An interesting source of e ective and safe skin-whitening agents are plants extract. The e cacy of plant-derived ingredients as skin lightening agents might be analysed and compared using various recently established in vitro methods that are more accurate and reliable than the commonly used mush-room tyrosinase activity assay. Advantages and disadvantages of thesemethods will be discussed. Examples of novel skin-whitening extracts andcompounds found during the original research and described in recent publi-cations will be presented and compared with currently used cosmetic ingre-dients. The advantages of the application of plant extracts rather thanpuried compounds in skin whitening cosmetics will also be discussed.

Although IBDs etiology remains unknown, the mecha- nisms of in flammation and oxidative stress as well as dysbiotic conditions and aberrations in the epithelial barrier are recognized as involved in the pathoge-nesis of these diseases [1]. Conventional therapy in IBDs uses anti-in flamma- tory and immunosuppressive corticosteroids, as well as biological drugs,however, the low remission rate and the severe side e ects of these therapies are not satisfactory for IBDs pharmacological treatment. Thus, there is a greatneed for new drugs with anti-in flammatory and anti-oxidant activities. In this study we evaluated the e ect of Plumericin, one of the main bioactive components extracted from the bark of Himatanthus sucuuba (Woodson) on intestinal in flammation, both in vitro , on rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), and in vivo , in an experimental model of DNBS-induced colitis. Our results indicated that Plumericin signi cantly reduces pro-in flammatory factors with a pivotal in IBDs, such necrosis to factor-kB (NF-kB) activation and to reduce reactive oxygen species(ROS) Plumericin activates the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nrf2) anti-oxidant pathway inhibited in flammasome IEC-6. The anti-in flammatory and antioxidant e ects observed in vitro , associated with a reduced intestinal macroscopic damage, were con rmed in vivoin DNBS-induced colitis in rat. Plumericin shows anti-in flammatory and antioxidant activities at intestinal level and therefore, could be a promising agent the treatment of IBDs. References [1] K. Panchal LB.

Quantum mechanical calculationsare capable of providing deep and independent insights and form a strongsupport for applied spectroscopy.

NIR spectra of thymol in dependence of the sample state (solid, melted and soluted) and concentration (for soluted sample) were analyzed. Patternedspectral changes were observed, indicating that the di erences between the bands in their sensitivity to the intermolecular interactions are re flected in the quantitative models. The analysis of PLS regression coe cients vector in the quanti cation of thymol content in Thymi herba based on NIR spectros- copy was conducted.

Conventional qualitycontrol techniques may fall short on speed of analysis. Vibrational spect-roscopy provides rapid results, uses no solvents and is non-destructive.The application of vibrational spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging(HSI) in combination with chemometric data analysis as a quality control method was demonstrated using several examples: 1) species di erentia- tion; 2) biomarker quanti cation and 3) percentage composition. Spect- ral data was acquired in the mid-infrared (4000-500 cm -1)a n dn e a r infrared (10 000-4000 cm-1) wave regions and hyperspectral images were acquired in the shortwave infrared region (920-2514 nm).

A reduction of oedemain the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema test suggested an anti-inflammatory activity in vivo [1]. Recent investigations indicated the iso- flavone sativanone to be a potent inhibitor of human hyaluronidase-1, an enzyme strongly related to induction of in flammatory cellular res- ponse [2]. During further studies showed concentration-dependent inhibi-tion LPS prestimulated human neutro- phils. This inhibitory activity was shown to be mainly due to thepresence of the norneolignan clitorienolactone B and the triterpene - onocerin. In addition, extract as well as clitorienolactone B and -onoce- rine signi cantly decreased the expression of adhesion molecules CD11b/CD18 and conversely increased the expression of CD62L in LPS-stimulated human neutrophils, a nding that is in line with reduced inflammatory response by inhibition of adhesion and migration of immune cells.As all of the observed e ects are potentially mediated via the Toll-like recep- tor 4 signaling pathway, TLR4 transfected and non-trans-fected con rming TLR-4 antagonism. An aqueous extract from the roots of O. spinosa also showed antagonistic e ects. This study rationalizes the traditional use of extracts from O. spinosa for the- rapy of urinary tract infections and rheumatic conditions, due to its potentialanti-in flammatory e ects that are in part mediated viaTLR-4 receptor antagonism.

Furthermore, they signi cantly inhibited IL-1 , ROS, and MCP-1 production and the expression of the adhesionmolecules CD11a, CD11b, and CD62L.In conclusion, the bioactivity of the DCM extract could be traced back to thepresence of sesquiterpene lactones, which seem to interact with several poten- tial therapeutic pathways including the NF- B pathway, a key regulator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [2].

Hydro-ethanolic extracts were prepared and characterized by HPLC-DADand GC/MS analysis, then screened for their ability to inhibit tumornecrosis factor (TNF) -induced IL-8 and IL-6 release, in human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1 and AGS). The activity of the extracts on NF- B driven transcription was also evaluated.After preliminary screening, were chosen among eleven plants for in-depth studies. The selected extracts reduced in a concentration-dependent fashion both the cytoki-nes release (IC 50between 0.19 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL) B cription (IC 50between 0.33 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL). Chemical secondary metabolites (androstenone, chlorogenic acid, pimaric acid,catechin, ca ,5,7-trihydroxy flavanone, gingerol, shogaol, paradol and gallotannins) could potentially justify the biological proper-ties observed. Results obtained from this study showed that six extracts reduced in flamma- tory markers by impairing NF- B signalling at the gastric level, justifying, at least in part, the Cameroonian traditional use of these spices. However, othermolecular mechanisms cannot be excluded, and further studies are neededto better clarify their biological activities.

This extremely interesting outcome provided the scienti c basis to investigate the actual producer (s) responsible for maytansine biosynthesis in Maytenus plants. Endophy- tic communities harboring tissues of Maytenus serrata origina- ting from Cameroon were investigated using a combination ofbioanalytical tools such as HPLC-HRMS nand MALDI-MSI, and targeted genome mining techniques to elucidate the source and sites of maytan-sine biosynthesis. We proved that the biosynthesis of maytansine in M. serrata is shared between the endophytic bacterial community colonizing the stem and the host plant containing non-culturable cryptic endophy-tes [3].Conclusion : Our work demonstrates that maytansine is biosynthesized in M. serrata only when the host plant joins forces with its selected and very eco- This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Their complex and constrained three-dimensional structures endowthese molecules with exceptional biological properties, thereby giving thema major role in drug discovery programs. However, the pharmaceuticalindustry 's lack of interest in studying natural resources has been apparent since the early 2000s. Two main reasons for this disa ection can be put for- ward. The methods providing information on the bioactivity potential ofnatural products before their isolation are still lacking, but they are of keyinterest to target the isolation of valuable natural products only. On theother hand, the procedures for isolating and characterizing bioactive secon-dary metabolites from complex mixtures are often long, costly and tedious. The steps necessary to prioritize extracts and to isolate compounds of inte- rest in a targeted, rapid and e ective manner are therefore essential. To add- ress these issues, we have recently developed a molecular networking-basedstrategy ( Fig. 1 ) consisting in deciphering the relationship between spectral networks and biological activities and further exploiting it to prioritize theisolation of bioactive secondary metabolites [1 -3].

However, deter-mination of active principle i.e.identifying, isolating and testing each mole- cule is complex, long and tedious taking into account molecular diversity ofthe extracts.The objective of this study is to associate i) the dereplication informationobtained by means of molecular networks and ii) a bioguided fractionationby Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC). This combination allows developing a simple and fast approach to obtain and test simpli ed fractions, even pure molecules, thus facilitating screening and identi cation of the bio- active principles.Firstly, the aerial Artemisia annua and Artemisia vulgaris were ext- racted and was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS,CUPRAC and FRAP assays. Extracts with positive response were subjectedto UHPLC-HRMS with autoMS/MS experiments in order to build molecu-lar networks using GNPS platform. Molecular networks linked com-pounds according to spectra similarities (same ions and/or neutrallosses) then grouping the numerous analytes by molecular families.Secondly, crude extracts were fractionated using CPC with an adaptedArizona solvent system according to molecular families ( e.g. sesquiter- pernes; phenolic derivatives). The numerous fractions were evaluated forantioxidant activity. Active fractions of the two plants were analyzed byFIA-HRMS in order to identify the isolated molecules, which can be loca-ted on the molecular network.Therefore, this approach has rapidly revealed the few major phenoliccompounds that are responsible for the antioxidant activity of the ext-racts: Artemisia annua (one compound) and Artemisia vulgaris (four compounds).

While TLC is widely used in lichenology, mainly for chemotaxonomic purpose [3], the eld remains underexplored in regards to the standards set in the era of metabolomics.Highly informative approaches through high resolution LC-MS and NMRare commonplace but their e ciency as a quick dereplication method for complex mixtures is highly reliant on databases. Consequently, with theaim to provide to the lichen chemist community a modern dereplication methodology using HRLC-MS/MS analysis, a database constituting of MS/MS spectra for lichen metabolites is under construction. A signi cant num- ber of lichen molecules was collected, thanks to 300 pure compounds gra-ciously donated by the Berlin Botanical Museum, completed by somemolecules from the chemic al library of University of Rennes. All molecules were then analysed by HRLC-MS/MS selecting the most appropriate ioniza-tion mode. In total 250 lichen compounds representing 8 main structuralclasses have been recorded. Data were converted to mzXML format usingthe ProteoWizard Toolkit [4] and manually curated to be treated usingMZmine [5]. The resulting spectra a re ready to be uploaded online and to serve as a public database for the community. References [1] Chambers MC et al.

Regulatory A airs Workshop RA-01 research to regulation Authors Howard C1 Institute 1De Montfort University, The Gateway, Leicester, U.K DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399699 The use of DNA-testing for the herbal industry has been a hotly debatedissue for several years [1]. During this time the methodologies haveadvanced, di erent approaches have been advocated and strengths and weaknesses highlighted. In 2016 the British Pharmacopoeia became the rst to publish a DNA-based method for the identi cation of herbal drugs. This was intentionally placed in a non -mandatory section of the publica- tion and focused on the provision of a 'reference sequence 'for each herbal drug. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia has published ITS2 sequences for herbaldrugs, and species-speci c assays are being investigated by the US Phar- macopoeia. Examples of these tec hniques and their properties are described.Harmonisation between the di erent global stakeholders would be a dis- tinct advantage to the industry and facilitate compliance across theboard; it is imperative that the methods proposed are transparent andaccessible.Through examples, the various issues that arise in the complex and variedsupply chains for medicinal plants are described, arriving at the conclusionthat DNA-based methods are a powerful piece of the puzzle for Quality Assu-rance but that this must be seen as part of a larger picture, along with phyto-chemical and other methods.

ISL Herbal medicine exhibits speci c challenges because of its complex multi compound composition and its inherent variance. Due to the pro-gress of modern analytical technologies, more and more in-depth know-ledge about the chemical composition of the plant material, the extractand its nal dosage form can be obtained. This opens up fascinating opportunities from a scienti c perspective but also from an industry point of view. At the same time questions arises how those moderntechnologies can potentially a ect the regulation of future quality cont- rol. This topic has to be discussed in a balanced way, the aim should beto use those powerful tools for a better quality control, but with the condition that the technical and regulatory setting still should be reali- stic and practicable.In this talk, the term \"hyphenated methods \"is at one hand used in a classic sense of connecting chromatographic te chniques with detectors (LC-UV, LC-MS, GC-MS) and at the other hand in the sense of analyzing the complex data obtai-ned from analytical techniques (MS, NMR, NIR, 1413 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

ISL RA - 03 DNA-based authentication: incorrect use and exaggerated expectations damage a valuable approach Authors Novak J1 Institute 1Institute Institute for Animal N utrition and Functional Plant Compounds, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, V eterinaerplatz 1, A-1210 Wien, AustriaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399701 Analysis of DNA with molecular methods is omnipresent in our everyday life.One of the many di erent applications is the identi cation of biotic materials useful for proo ng presence (authenticity) or absence of certain organisms. The importance of molecular biology has led to the development of a ple-thora of methods and a wealth of information in public databases. However,application of sophisticated technology in a new eld can take wrong turns, if expectations are wrong or too high, methods are incorrectly applied orresults not critically interpreted.Authentication of medicinal plants is a challenging task. DNA-basedauthentication is a wonderful supplementation and is already widelyapplied in risk management of critical medicinal plants. However, practi-cal application in our sector during the last decade has uncovered vulne-rabilities that are often not linked to the methods but rather to the wayof their application.DNA-based authentication needs expert knowledge : with advanced equipment and bioinformatics, many procedures of species identi cation can be auto- mated to a high degree, which often misleads to an uncritical view on results.DNA-based authentication needs expertise in both, molecular methods andpharmacognosy.Expectations : qualitative identi cation needs to be strictly distinguished from quantitative analysis. Although reliable quantitative molecular methods areavailable, and qualitative methods are run on quantitative equipment, stan-dard barcode markers cannot be used for quanti cation at all. Considering the peculiarities of medicinal plants raw materials, interme-diates and products, DNA-based authentication is a useful approach butneeds careful adaptation and harmonization. However, harmonizationmay not be so easy if freedom of action using molecular options should not be narrowed.

Among the techniques applied,NMR-spectroscopy plays a central role giving a detailed insight into consti-tution, con guration and conformation of the unknown compound. Des- pite the tremendous progress made in tailoring sophisticated pulsetechniques to solve structural probl ems, many natural products have been published showing a wrong structure p roposal leading to incorrect refe- rence material for subsequent conclusions with the e ect of making this erroneous knowledge base statistically more signi cant. A large number of comprehensive review articles [1, 2] describes the actual situation in detail. From this analysis the necessi ty of massive software applicationduring every step of the process of structure elucidation can be derived. The automatic peer-reviewing of some 700,000 C13-NMR spectra mainlytaken from the public domain literature has revealed a signi cant number of wrong structure proposals and/or wrong signal assignments [3]. Subse-quent application of a structure generator program based on the carbon-NMR data has created reasonable alternatives -in many cases in full a g r e e m e n tw i t ha na l r e a d yk n o w ns t r u c t u r er e v i s i o n .E x a m p l e sw i l lb egiven showing the immediate need to change the work flow of structure elucidation along the line from spectrum interpretation to peer-reviewingof manuscripts [4].

To improve this, bio-chemometric approaches have emerged in recent years. However, hit disco-very from a complex extract containing close structural analogues remainschallenging.Hence, the aim of this work was to unravel a complex bioactive mixture ofthe same compound class. This was achieved by a 1H NMR-MS work flow which we named ELINA (Eliciting Nature 's Activities) [1]. ELINA detects che- negatively ( 'cold ') correlated with bioactivity prior to any isolation. The approach is exempli ed in the discovery of steroid sulfatase (STS) [2] Fomitopsis pinicola Karst. To reduce the complexity of the extract, a single fractionation step was per-formed to give 32 fractions. This was done in a way to achieve varying con-centrations of a constituent over several fractions. Aliquots of all fractionswere forwarded to and complemented with MS data.The e ectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by disclosing chemical features crucial for STS inhibition, thus taking advantage from the innatecompound library produced by the polypore 's biosynthetic machinery. As a proof of concept piptolinic acid D and pinicolic acid B equipped with theseimperative features were isolated and showed IC s of 10.5 \u00b5M and 12.4 document was downloaded for personal use only.

Due to its wide application in folk medicine, theoleoresin has been subject of various studies examining its chemical compo- sition and the correlation with its health bene ts. As both, the diterpene acids and the biological activities vary betweenthe di erent Copaifera species [2], the aim of the present study was the development of analytical methods for the quanti cation of diterpene acids.Therst method reversed-phase material and evapo- rative light scattering detection. With this method precise (RSD values below4%), accurate (mean recovery rates of 91-105%) and sensitive quanti cation (LOQs of 10 and 20 \u00b5g/mL) was achieved. For the second assay, quantitativeheteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (qHSQC) of eight di cross-peaks were established and normalized with dimethyl terephthalate, which served asinternal standard. This approach allowed the direct quanti cation of four major and one minor diterpene, whereas he contents of the remaining minorcompounds were obtained with simple calculation procedures.Comparison with the UHPLC assay showed good agreement for seven of outof eight diterpenoids. In terms of precision, the qHSQC method was advanta-geous for the quanti cation of the three major compounds, whereas UHPLC was superior in the determination of the minor components.

SL F-03 Benzoxazinoid phytochemicals, abundant in rye bread, are taken up in humans. Analytical method for plasma metabolites is highly needed Authors Steensen (BXs) were identi ed for the rst time in young cereal plants in 1957 and in medic inal plants in 1969. In 2008 our lab discovered that BXs are present in mature cereal grains and in food/feed based on cerealwhole grains [1]. We showed that BXs are taken up in pigs, rats and humans[2-4], and that they appear in prostate tissue of humans consuming rye bread [5]. The aim of this study was to develop a method for identi cation and quanti cation of human phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites in plasma. The method included an initial protein precipitation step of the plasma withthe purpose of reducing the matrix interference. The chromatographic ana-lysis of BXs and their metabolites in the remaining extract was performed inLC-MS/MS. Pure standards were unavailable for most of the phase 2 meta-bolites. Phase 2 metabolites are present in much higher amounts in urinethan in plasma. Thus urine metabolites of BXs for which structures could beassigned using data dependent acquisition were isolated and used for veri - cation of MS/MS signals in plasma extracts. The isolation of approx 10 \u00b5g ofeach compound was done with consecutive HLB and mixed mode SPE 's (Oasis, Waters) exploiting the variety of polarity and acidity of the metabo-lites. Glucuronide and paracetamol were used asstandards for semi-quanti cation due to their structural similarity and com- mercial availability. References [1] Pedersen HA, Laursen B, Mortensen A et al.

SL G-02 Potential anti-herpes and possibilities, such as anticancer andantiviral activities [1, 2] were proposed for cardiac glycosides used totreat heart diseases. The present work aimed to synthesize the readilyaccessible 3 -azido-3-deoxydigitoxigenin from digitoxigenin. Two new series of compounds were obtained from 3 -azido-3-deoxydigitoxigenin: (i)O-glycosyl trizols through click chemistry with propargyl glycosides; and (ii) compounds substituted in the alpha carbonyl position with di e- rent residues linked via an amino-group. All obtained derivatives hadtheir chemical structures con rmed, and their anti-herpes (against HSV- types 1 and 2 replication) and cy totoxic (against PC3 , A549, HCT-8 and evaluated. Compounds 10and 11(Fig. 1 ) exhibited the most promising results against HSV-1 (KOS and 29-Rstrains) and HSV-2 (333 strain) replication with SI values > 1000. Bothcompounds were also the most cytotoxic for the human cancer cell lines tested with IC 50values similar to those of paclitaxel. They also presented reduced toxicity toward non-cancerous cell lines (MRC-5 and HGF cells).Promising compounds were tested in regard to their ability to inhibitNa +/K+-ATPase. The inhibition rate correlated suitably with the bioacti- vity demonstrated by both compounds against the di erent human cancer cells tested as well as against HSV replication. Moreover, theresults showed that speci c chemical features of compounds 10and 11 influenced the bioactivities tested. In summary, it was possible to obtain novel digitoxigenin-derivatives with remarkable cytotoxic and anti-herpesactivities as well as low toxicity and high selectivity. In this way, theycould be considered potential molecules for the development of newdrugs.References [1] Schneider NFZ, Cerella C, Sim\u00f5es 2017; 22 [2] Bertol JW, Rigotto C, al.

The concept of these approaches is to start from ext-racts and abundant NPs to obtain active compounds using chemical and bio-logical reactions. Given that 20% of marketed drugs contain halogen atoms,a methodology has been developed to allow controlled halogenation of com-pounds directly in plant extracts [1]. In addition, biotransformation chemicalreactions of single NPs using enzymes secreted by a phytopathogenic fungushave been successfully used to obtain a wide variety of compounds [2]. Ametabolite pro ling based in the UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-HRMS analysis were used to monitor these di erent reactions and highlight the presence of the new generated compounds. In the majority of cases, it was possible to improvethe chemical diversity of the original NPs leading to the acquisition of activecompounds from inactive sca olds. In order to isolate, characterize and study the biological activities of the generated compounds, the use of high-resolution preparative chromatographic methods was mandatory. At thislevel, signi cant improvements for the e cient targeted isolation of given NPs through dry load injection and chromatographic gradient transfermethods have been made [3]. The applications, possibilities and limitations of these latest technologies will be illustrated with recent investigations per- formed in our laboratory.

Our data suggests that - mangostin interacts with the androgen receptor, and may disrupt ARfunctionality and degrade AR. Two di erent prostate cancer cell lines (22R 1 and LNCaP) were used to evaluate e cacy and perform mecha- nism of action studies. Xanthone treatments promote a dose and timedependent decrease in AR, along with an additional increase in chape-rone proteins involved in degradation. Additionally, there is a reductionin the phosphorylation pro le of AR, suggesting these actions inhibit the nuclear translocation of AR. Consequently, these actions inhibit thetranscription of downstream genes that are necessary for cell growthand proliferation. Our results suggest that -mangostin promotes AR degradation by inhibiting nuclear translocation and may be e ective against drug resistant prostate cancer cases.

Restriction of the innate in flammatory response of animals might be one of the key mechanisms responsible for the observed growth promo-tion. Phytogenic feed additives harness the chemical richness o ered by plants, which many are known to possess anti-in flammatory properties. In the present study a phytogenic feed additive has been assessed for potentialinflammation-restricting properties both in vitro and in vivo, the latter including novel RNA sequencing technology. First evidence for potential anti-in flammatory properties was obtained from TNF- -stimulated IPEC-J2. Subsequently, a feeding trial with broiler chickens was conducted with an in flammatory challenge (coccidiosis vaccine overdosing) in order to compare e ects on cecal gene expression when feeding the phytogenic product or a anticoccidial drug (positivecontrol).The in flammatory challenge signi cantly a ected the expression of more than 500 genes compared to non-challenged birds. ost of these genes belon-ged to innate immune system or cytokine signaling pathways. This e ect was almost completely reversed by feeding an anticoccidial additive, while inthe phytogenic group approximately half of the genes were regulated backto the normal level of the unchallenged control group. Thendings corroborate the relevance of limiting in flammatory processes by phytogenic feed additives. Next-generation sequencing opens opportunitiesfor studies on mechanisms of action of feed additives and may assist in fur-ther development.Funding by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) is gratefullyacknowledged.SL I-02 Evaluation of the traditional use of some Yemeni plants for the treatment of some livestock diseases Authors Alasbahi RH1, Groot MJ2 Institute 1Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Aden University, Aden, Yemen; 2Wageningen Food Safety Research, Akkermaalsbos 2, 6708 WB Wageningen, NetherlandsDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399715 Livestock is an integral component of agriculture production in Yemen.The aim of our work resides in the scienti c substantiation of the ethno- veterinary use of some plants [1] based on the evaluation of their bioac-tivities and toxicological properties.

However, it is not known if the anti-para-sitic e ect is from the action of individual SL 's or a combined synergistic eect of di erent compounds within the plant. In this project, we aimed to isolate and characterize the active com-pounds from chicory and assess their anti-parasitic activity in a numberof GIP.SL enriched extracts from ve dierent chicory cultivars were prepared and analyzed by HPLC-MS. The extracts were tested for anti-parasitic e ects using a model in vitro system based on assessing viability of third stage larvae of the swine nematode Ascaris suum. PCA analysis of the molecular pro les from di erent cultivars led to identi cation of likely groups of active com- pounds. In parallel, bio-guided fractionation of chicory MeOH:DCM extractonA. suum using in vitro led to several active fractions. The active frac- tions were submitted to flash chromatography and puri ed compounds were identi ed by NMR. Indeed one speci c SL showed a moderate e ect in the A. suum assay. Given the magnitude of the e ect, a synergistic e ect with other SL's cannot be excluded. Further research is devoted to nding these syner- gistic combinations and explore the anti-parasitic e ect of the identi ed sin- gle SL in other assays. References [1] Pena-Espinoza M., Thamsborg S.

An Asteraceae medicinal plant, B. pilosa , has been studied for over 40 diseases. In this presentation, we summarize the bene cial properties and mechanistic study of B. pilosa , based on our recent studies. First, we found that B. pilosa was therapeu- tically e ective against coccidiosis in chickens as evidenced by a survival rate, gut pathology, fecal oocyst excretion and anti-coccidial index. Next, we showed that B. pilosa signicantly increased body weight gain and decreased feed conversion ratio in chickens. Compared to anti-coccidialdrugs, B. pilosa developed, if any, little drug resistance. Next, we perfor- med pyrosequencing of the PCR ampilcons based on the 16S rRNA genesof gut bacteria in chickens. Metagenomic analysis indicated that the chi-cken gut bacteria belonged to 6 phyla, 6 classes, 6 orders, 9 families,and 8 genera. More importantly, we found that B. pilosa aected the composition of bacteria. This change in bacteria composition was corre-lated with body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and gut pathology inchickens. Collectively, our work suggests that B. pilosa has bene cial eects on growth performance and protozoan infection in chickens pro- bably via multiple mechanisms, including prebiotic action and interfe-rence with protozoan life cycle.

By contrast, scienti cl i t e r a t u r e lacks on chemical composition or biological activity data from aqueousfraction obtained from industrial hemp flowers, which have long been considered as waste products. In this context, the main focus of the fol-lowing study is the evaluation of antioxidant and anti-in flammatory eects related to aqueous flower hemp cultivars (Futura 75, Kc virtus, Carmagnola Cs and Villanova). We evalua-ted the extract phytochemical pro le. Then, we studied the water ext- racts both in vitro and ex vivo in order to test protective e ects in an experimental model of ulcerative colitis, constituted by isolated LPS-sti-mulated colon. All cultivar extracts displayed similar total phenol andflavonoid content. On the other hand, Futura 75 cultivar extract dis- played a better antioxidant and anti-in flammatory pro le. Considering this, Futura 75 extract has been subsequently tested to evaluate its eect on pathogen bacterial and fungal species involved in ulcerative colitis, nding a signi cant inhibition on the growth of C. albicans and selected Gram positive and negative bacterial strains.Taken together, our results support the potential e cacy of Futura 75 water extracts in managing the clinical symptoms related to ulcerativecolitis.

Recently, EPs \u00ae7630 add-on therapy was also acknowled- ged in the Swiss National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)Guidelines for pharmacological management of stable COPD [2]. Amongthe main goals of current pharmacotherapy in COPD as described by theGlobal Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Report2019 [3] are the reduction of frequency and severity of exacerbationsand the improvement of health status. Based on this background, anoverview on clinical e cacy and safety of EPs \u00ae7630 treatment in COPD is presented. Study results show that add-on therapy with 3x30 drops/day EPs \u00ae7630 over 24 weeks in addition t o a standardized baseline treatment according to GOLD led to a signi cantly prolonged time to exacerbation, to fewer exacerbations, improved quality of life, higherpatient satisfaction, less days of inability to work, and a reduction inantibiotic use in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The incidenceof adverse events was comparable to placebo. In conclusion, theseresults demonstrate a statistically signi cant and clinically relevant supe- riority of EPs \u00ae7630 add-on therapy com pared to placebo and an excellent long-term tolerability and safety in the treatment of patientssuering from COPD.

Among others, benzodiazepines and valerian prepa-rations are used to treat stress symptoms.The aim of this study was to investigate whether the prescription of a xed herbal extract combination of valerian, lemon balm, passion flower and but- terbur (Ze 185)[1,2] changes the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines inhospitalised psychiatric patients. In a retrospective case-control study anony-mised medical record data from 3252 psychiatric in-house patients were ana-lysed over a 2.5-year period. Cases (n=1548) with a prescription of Ze 185and controls (n=1704) were matched by age, gender, hospitalisation intervaland main ICD-10 F-diagnoses. Primary objective was to investigate the e ect of Ze 185 on the prescription pattern of benzodiazepines. Secondary objecti-ves investigated the prescriptions of concomitant drugs and e ectiveness of the hospital stay. Distribution of drug classes was analysed by the WHO 'sA T C code.

The data of this retrospective case-control study provide some evidence that Ze 185 in addition to standard therapy could reduce the need for benzodiaze-pines. Data showed that both therapeutic settings had a comparable clinicaleectiveness but with signi cantly fewer prescriptions of benzodiazepines in the Ze 185 group (p =0.006).This is of clinical importance because suitable alternatives to benzodiazepinesare desirable. To obtain more support for this hypothesis, a dedicated rand-omised, controlled clinical trial monitoring drug safety is required.

Past research suggests that honey and pollen fee-ding upregulates the bees 'detoxi cation system and that dietary reduces the toxicity of imidacloprid and tau- fluvalinate [1,2]. The aim of this study was to investigate the e ect of dietary quercetin on the concentration of three pesticides present in honey bees. Honeybees (n=600) were divided in ve groups and fed either quercetin-suc- rose paste or only sucrose for 72 h before being exposed to the neon-icotinoid imidacloprid (oral exposure), the fungicide tebuconazole or theacaricide tau- fluvalinate (contact exposure). Bees were anesthetized with CO2, frozen, and extracted with a validated QuEChERS method. Finally,the concentrations of all three above-mentioned pesticides were deter-mined by LC-MSMS. Quanti cation results of the three pesticides in honey bee samples ( Fig. 1 ) displayed that there was a signi cant di e- rence in concentration of imidacloprid ( P=210-5) and tau- fluvalinate (P=310-2) between the bees that were fed quercetin-sucrose paste and bees that were fed only sucrose. However, there was no signi cant dierence in the level of tebuconazole in the group of bees that were fed quercetin-sucrose paste and bees that were fed only sucrose ( P=4.2 10-1). The results of this study demonstrate that honey bee intake ofAbstracts This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Hence, quercetin may be a promising bioactive compound in chemo-ecological aspects to counteract the hazard of pesticides.

Hence, chromatography is a pre- requisite for the isolation of compounds for complete structural characteri-zation [1]. Counter-current chromatography (CCC) was developed as analternative to conventional methods, with the high advantage of lack ofsolid support [2]. The solvent system can be adjusted according to thepolarity of the target compounds to favor separation based upon their par-tition coe cients [3]. The aim of this work is to describe the isolation and structural characterization of secondary metabolites from Chilean fruits,including Ribes and andina nidin cyanidin glycosides and rutinosides. Gaultheria species, anthocyanins were were ed as cyanidin and phinidin addition, Gevuina avellana , two dipeptides were isolated the roasted samples. In the arils of Prumnopitys andina, the steroid 20-hydro- xyecdysone was found. All the isolated compounds were obtained withhigh purity and were structurally characterized by extensive NMR analy-sis, QTOF mass spectrometry, absorbance pro le and IR spectrum. CCC proved to be a valuable tool for the isolation of main secondary meta-bolites in complex mixtures from Chilean native fruits. The isolated com-pounds are being assessed for the bioactivity and health-promotingproperties of native Chilean food resources. References [1] Wolfender J-L, Marti G, Thomas A, Bertrand S.

A shampoo containing 5 % rosemary (Rosmarinus o cinalis), 5 % oregano was shown to activity in cats with micro- sporiasis [1]. The treatment was well tolerated, without any adverseeects. Aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro ecacy of this EO treatment in feline S. aureus -associated pyoderma by testing the EO mixture as well as single components against S. aureus isolated from skin of pyodermic cats.

Oregano, Turkish thyme oil, and the mixture ofEOs exhibited an in vitro antibacterial activity, while rosemary oil did not inhibit bacterial growth (Tab. 1). Higher concentration of EOs as well aslonger incubation time led to reduction of CFU, even a total growthinhibition could be achieved. Overall, the EO mixture showed better anti-bacterial e cacy than single EOs. EO concentration has stronger impact than incubation time. Interestingly, comparison of single bacterial isola-tes reveals a heterogenous dose dependent reduction of CFU and di e- rent susceptibility patterns of S. aureus isolates have to be discussed. To conclude, the EO mixture is a promising candidate for treatment of S. aureus- associated pyoderma in cats. The antibacterial e ect most likely originates from oregano and Turkish thyme oil.

Anti-quorum sensing was determined by inhibition of quorum violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium viola- ceum. Inhibition of adherence of E. coli to intestinal cells by extracts was evaluated using a Caco-2 cell enterocyte anti-adhesion model. Ultrastructuraleects of E. zeyheri and S. legatii extracts on E. coli were assessed using elect- ron microscopy. Phytochemical analysis was done using Gas Chromatogra-phy-Mass quorum sensing inhibitory concentration (MQSIC) between 0.08 and 0.31mg/ml respectively. Apart from S. legatii , other plant extracts and vanillin (positive control) had good antiquorum sensing activity. Eugenia zeyheri and S. gerrardii signicantly reduced adhesion of E. coli to Caco-2 intestinal cells. The extracts of E. zeyheri and S. legatii damaged the cytoplas- mic membrane and inner structure of E. coli .-Amyrin, friedelan-3-one, lupeol, and -sitosterol were abundant in the extracts. The plant extracts have potential as phytogenic feed additives althoughanimal trials are needed. Compounds in the extracts may be drug templatesto develop novel antimicrobial agents.

P-V-11 E ects of phytogenic feed additives on mortality and growth performance of weanedpiglets Authors Aumiller T, Chamusco S, DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399737 Weaning is a stressful period in the life of pigs coming along with increased sus-ceptibility to environmental and pathogenic challenges and resulting in decrea-sed growth performance [1]. Phytogenic feed additives (PFA) have the potentialto influence palatability of the feed and support health and well-being of ani- mals [2]. Consequently, the current study aimed to evaluate the bene ts of a PFA on growth-performance in piglets post-weaning.A total of 192 piglets (each 96 m and f) weaned at day 23.4 \u00b1 1.21 were distri-buted to 24 pens with 8 piglets. 12 pens each were randomly assigned to eitheran unsupplemented control (NC), or a diet supplemented with a PFA for a 35-day feeding trial. Body weight (BW) and feed intake were recorded after weeks1, 2, 3 and 4. In group NC, 7 piglets died or had to be removed during the trial, Tab. 1 Planta Medica 2019; 85: 1386 -1590 1427 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

As a result, no signi cant di erence on growth performance was observed, although PFA animals showed numerically higher ADG in each period (up to +6.8% fromday 21-35). Considering mortality and numerically increased ADG, there was atendency for increased total BW gain with the PFA compared to the NC(+11.4%, P=0.083).In conclusion, the applied PFA was suitable to support the animals throughthe post-weaning period, resulting in decreased mortality and numericallyimproved BW gain.

In ourstudy, we separated 240 pigs (LW x LR X PI) at the age of 9 - 10 weeks in twodierent groups in 24 pens. For the following period of 14 weeks, control group was fed a basal diet and treatment group was fed a basal diet supple-mented with Digestarom \u00aeDC Power (100 g/t). The study was carried out in IFIP- National Experimental Station, France. The nal body weight and the ave- rage daily gain were numerically increased in the Digestarom\u00aegroup. In addi- tion, the feed conversion rate (FCR) was numerically decreased in thetreatment group. The fat and lean content of the carcass of one pig per pen(24 pigs in total, 12 per group) was determined by CT scan. The lean contentin Digestarom \u00aeDC Power fed pigs was increased by 3.6% (p<0.1), whereas the fat content was decreased by 8.7% (p<0.1). Thus, Digestarom\u00aeDC Power results in an optimized FCR and a better weight performance numerically, but with no statistical signi cance. Furthermore, pig fed the feed additive showed an increase of lean content and a reduction of fat content. Those facts promiseah i g h e re c o n o m i cb e n e t.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity, safety and anti-bio-lm potential of leaf extracts of Morinda lucida against eight Salmonella sero- vars. M. lucida is used in traditional treatment of human typhoid and malariafever. Acetone and aqueous leaf extracts of M. lucida were screened for anti- bacterial activity against several serovars Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica including Idikan (humans and (birds and and (birds microdilution assay. The cytotoxic and anti-bio lm potential of the acetone and aqueous extracts were also determined againsthuman colon cancer (Caco-2) cells and Salmonella biolm formation respectively.The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts ranged from0.09 to 1.87 mg/ml. The LC 50values of the acetone and aqueous extracts against the Caco-2 cells were 0.46 and 0.33 mg/ml respectively. The acetoneextract the strongest anti-bio lm activity against S. Enteritidis . The range of selectivity index (SI) values of the acetone and aqueous extracts was 1.00to 6.57 and 0.23 to 8.28 respectively.

Garlic is used in manyherb mixtures. Anthelmintic e ects of garlic have been described [2]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the e ect of two garlic formula- tions, i.e. garlic dragee (GD) and fresh garlic extract (GE), at three dilu-tion levels (0%, 10%, 20%) stagelarvae. GDs were sourced from the local pharmacy. The content of oneGD was solved in 10 mg water. GE was prepared by cooking 75 g of crushed fresh garlic with 125 g water over 5 minutes (the content of GD corresponded to 6 g of fresh garlic according to the lea flet infor- mation). The parasitic larvae were extracted from faeces pasturedgoats after incubation of the feces at 28 \u00b0C for 10 days. Puri ed third larvae were incubated with GD, GE, tetramisole hydrochloride (positivecontrol) and water (negative control) for 3 hours at room temperature.The rates of exsheathment were counted 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutesafter starting the exsheathment process with diluted sodium hypochlo-rite. Signi cantly lower exsheathment rates were registered for the 0% (5,7; 1,1) 19,5). Although the in vitro examination showed dilution depen- dent e ects of garlic solutions on the exsheathment of parasite larvae, further studies are necessary to nd eective dosages when feeding herbal mixtures in small ruminants.

Preventive oral administration ofAllium sativum L. (AS, garlic) represents an option to reduce antimicrobial medication by improving health and performance in postweaning pigs. A trial was conducted on a commercial Swiss farm [1]. Six-hundred piglets were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. For the rst two weeks post weaning, the piglets received orally 0.3 g dried AS-powder/kg body weight/day, 6 mg colistin-sulphate/kg body weight /day or a placebo (PL). Pigletswere observed until the end of the third week post weaning. For the time ofthe study, daily weight gain (DWG) was measured weekly on individual basis.Data were analysed using generalized mixed e ect models. DWG of placebo-treated piglets was signi cantly lower compared to AS (61 g; p=0.008) and (61 g; weaning ( Fig. 1 ). Due to severe diarrhoea, three out of nine (33%) of AS and the placebo pens were treated with antibiotics. In conc-lusion, oral administration of dried AS-powder does not prevent severePWD but improves the growing performance compared to placebo.Thus, AS contributes to limiting the use of antimicrobials to strictly the-rapeutic indications.

Main Congress Poster Poster Session 1 P-001 A validated UHPLC-CAD method for quantitative determination of Astragaloside VII Authors Kurt M\u00dc1,T a\u00d62, Bedir E1 Institute 1Izmir Institute of Technology, Faculty of Engineering, 35430, Urla, Izmir, Turkey; 2Bionorm 10.1055/s-0039-3399749 Astragaloside rst tridesmosidic saponin identi nature [1], possesses potent immunostimulatory/adjuvant e ects [2]. Based on the promising adjuvant properties comparable to current adjuvants(i.e. Alum and QS-21), our team has decided to carry out further studies onAST VII including semi-synthesis studies to discover and develop new human/animal vaccine adjuvants [2 -5]. Since more than 450 Astragalus species grow wildly in Turkish flora, one of the rst challenges of this adjuvant development project is to examine these spe- cies by e cient analytical methods to nd AST VII rich plant materials and select the rich species for possible cultivation and/or pilot production studies. Thus, aim of this study was to develop a UHPLC method coupled with the ChargedAerosol Detector (CAD) in order to determine AST VII content simultaneously,precisely and sensitively in Astragalus samples. A fteen minutes method was developed using C18 (100 mm x 4 mm x 3 \u00b5m) column, eluting with gradientWater:Acetonitrile mixtures at 0.75 mL/min flow rate. The linear regression ana- lysis of calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r 2=0.9995 in con- centrations ranging from 52 to 208 g/mL. The method was validated for its calibration curve, speci city, precision and robustness. The recovery was found to be in the range of 98.17 to 101.86%. As a conclusion, for the rst time, a UHPLC method was validated to quantify AST VII utilizing CAD for its detection.

However, the mechanism of how these components act together to protect the plant is not fully understoodand is a subject of research.Aquaphotomics is a novel scienti c discipline, concerned with studying water, its structure and roles in biological systems[4]. It uses light-water interaction as asource of information and thus allows comp letely non-destructive, rapid, real- time measurements. Numerous aquaphotomics studies on plants revealed inte-resting roles of water molecular species i n plant tissues which provided rationale to apply aquaphotomics methodology to study the water in leaves in H. rhodo- pensis plants during desiccation and subsequent rehydration in order to under- stand the mechanism of protection of its tissues against the damage andsurvival in the dry state[5].The study discovered that together with rapid loss of water this plant performsdynamic control of water molecular structure keeping it in certain state. In thecompletely dried state H. rhodopensis plant drastically diminished free water molecules, cutting down the possibility for biochemical reactions, and accumu-lated water dimers and water molecules with 4 hydrogen bonds. In summary,what was concluded is that the protective compounds act synergistically toshape the water in plant tissues in a way which enables \"drying without dying \".

P-006 Determination of perillaldehyde in perilla herbs based on relative molar sensitivity (RMS) usinga combination powerful tool for producing absolutely pure reference standards (RSs) for HPLC. However, when the RS isunstable, the purity gradually declines before HPLC is performed and createsproblems in generating reliable quantit ative data. To address this, a method using a stable RS with relative molar sensitivity (RMS) to analyte has been repor-ted [1]. In this study, we used a stable RS for the determination of the unstablecompound perillaldehyde in perilla herbs, which is listed in the Japanese Pharma-copoeia (JP). We applied an o -line combination of 1H-qNMR and HPLC/UV to estimate the RMS of the analyte (perillaldehyde) to the RS. Diphenyl sulfone(DS), an inexpensive and stable reagent with a high purity, was selected as theRS. The response ratio (Rr) of the analyte to the RS, obtained by HPLC/UV, wascorrected using the molar ratio (Rn) obtained by 1H-qNMR. The experiment was validated using the same sample in ve NMR and seven HPLC instruments at ve institutes. The average RMS (Rr/Rn) was 0.983 and the reproducibility rela- tive was 1.027%. The perillaldehyde content of perillaherbs determined based on RMS was identical to that determined by the assaylisted in JP. These results revealed that the quantitative assay for perillaldehydein perilla herbs did not require an easily decomposable perillaldehyde reagentand that the method using the RMS of perillaldehyde to DS was thought to beacceptable to JP.

Avoiding the problem of irreversible adsorption to stationary phases, high performance counter current c hromatography (HPCCC) is a highly suited separation method providing higher resolution rates comparedto conventional chromatographic techniques [4]. To gain access to thefull spectrum of a wide range of diverse metabolites in a standardizedrose root dry extract obtained by 70 % ethanol extraction, a fast and ecient HPCCC method was developed. For the newly established nor- mal phase HPCCC method a two-phase solvent system consisting ofethyl acetate, n-butanol and water with a gradient ranging from 27.26/ 20.69/52.05 to 29.01/19.19/51.80, respectively, was used. Thirteenfractions were obtained based on their TLC pattern. Their dereplicationwas performed by UPLC-ESI-MS analysis, which led to the ~50 to 70% within onefractionation step out of the subjected crude extract.The herein established HPCCC-based fractionation method enabled the prepara-tive enrichment of major and minor constituents in one separation step, whichwas used for e cient further orthogonal chromatographic isolation of eight rose root metabolites for the determination of their not fully captured bioacti-vity spectrum.

In recent years, populations of this important medicinal plant in Germany and throughout Europe have collapseddramatically, especially in lowland locations. Within the Arnica montana popula- tion there are di erent genetic varieties which have to be considered for the conservation of biodiversity and for the maintenance of the reproductive capa- city of the plant. An open question is whether these genetic varieties also di er in their secondary metabolite pro les. The aim of this study is to develop an analytical method for the detection (con-tents and pro les) of sesquiterpene lactones in particular as well as some repre- sentative flavonoids and ca eic acids in flowers and leaves of Arnica montana . For this purpose, rst an in-house database of sesquiterpene lactones, flavo- noids and ca eic acids present in Arnica montana was established on the basis of literature data. Subsequently, fragmentation patterns of precursorions of ingredients were measured in product ion scan mode from extracts ofArnica montana plant material ( flowers and leaves) in positive and negative ionization mode. From the spectra, characteristic fragment ions were selec-ted for the development of an HPLC-MS/MS multi-method. HPLC gradientconditions and MRM-MS parameters were optimized. The methodology forthe quality controlled quanti cation of major constituents and identi cationof suitable reference compounds as biomarkers for high throughput analysis ofArnica montana varieties is in progress.

As would be expected, variation was found between the published sequences. However, several sequencesappeared to be mislabelled, and on investigation of some accompanyingmanuscripts a link to unveri ed material was shown. To quality control this issue, several steps were taken to critically evaluatesequence data. This was then further developed into a guideline for the assess-ment of published sequences ( Fig. 1 ) which can be used for any investigation.

Functionalfoods with -glucosidase inhibitory properties is a complementary choice for diabetes patients. Lagerstroemia speciosa has been applied traditionally for an antihyperglycemic purpose in traditional medicines. Corosolic acid is consi-dered as bioactive constituents for glucose lowering e ect of L. peciosa [1, 2]. In the present study, we aimed to determine corosolic acid in Lagerstroemia species using the developed HPLC-UV method and their -glucosidase inhibi- tory potency. In addition, we developed the new source of corosolic acidusing the plant tissue culture technique. According to analytical performanceincluding precision, sensitivity, and accuracy, the developed HPLC-UVmethod is reliable and applicable for corosolic acid determination of theLagerstroemia species. The compound exists in varied amount in di erent Lagerstroemia species (0.21 \u00b1 0.01 to 3.77 \u00b1 0.17 mg/g dry wt.). The mature leaves composed the highest content. Although standardized extract usuallyprepared using L. speciosa , our results revealed that L. macrocarpa and L. lou- donii contained much higher amounts of corosolic acid. In addition, the callus culture of L. speciosa also produced high content of corosolic acid. The coro- solic contents of investigated Lagerstroemia species with -glucosidase inhibi- tory activity. Therefore, this method is worth for antidiabetic standardizationofLagerstroemia derived materials. References [1] Klein G, Kim J, Himmeldirk K, Cao Y, Chen X.

Previous studies highlighted the signicant variability in the quality of marketed products of di erent prove- nance [1, 2]. In addition to extremely of hypericins and thedetection of dyes, a number of samples were found to showcase chemical n- gerprints distinct from the pharmacopoeial description. This project aims toestablish baseline standards for high quality materia prima including an under-standing of the natural variability. Therefore, a collection of raw materialsfrom 14 countries was analysed using NMR-based metabolomics pro ling and HPTLC. A number of samples 'heavy metal content was determined. The ana- lysis of the raw materials showed some degree of variability, which is non-sig-nicant compared to the marketed products 'variation. The chemical dierences noticed where identi ed, disambiguated and preliminarily assigned to 3ngerprint types. The existence of four geographically distinct subspecies of SJW [3] was investigated as a potential factor behind these di erences and an attempt to build a statistical model to predict the provenance of the samp- les based on NMR results was made. The di erence between the legal limits for cadmium prescribed by the European Pharmacopoeia and WHO, respecti-vely, highlights the need for regulatory concordance. Understanding the mate-ria prima remains a challenge due to the numerous factors involved.Therefore, regulatory agencies need to consider and assess this complexity, inorder to resolve quality challenges in the rst step of the value chain.

E cient analytical methodologies for cannabi- noids determination are thus crucial for hemp quality testing and utilisation [3]. In this context, the present study aimed to develop an integrated proce- dure for the e ective extraction and quantitative analysis of the major canna- binoids in hemp.Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), mi crowave-assisted extraction (MAE) and dynamic maceration (DM) were examined using EtOH as reference solvent [4].UAE displayed superior performance and was further optimised through Designof Experiments (DoE), maximising the r ecovery of cannabinoids. Rapid and reliable quanti cation of principal c annabinoids was achieved by means of UPLC-PDA. The method was developed and validated utilising highly-pure cannabi- noids isolated by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) [5]. Several extra-ction solvents were also evaluated using the optimised UAE protocol and UPLC-PDA. HPTLC densitometry combined with chemometrics was implemented forclassication of the extracts obtained with di erent solvent types to ensure a broad range of bioactive compounds.In this work, a highly-e cient UPLC-PDA method coupled with a simpli ed UAE-based extraction protocol is presented for the quanti cation of the prin- cipal cannabinoids cost-e ective ngerprint analysis for solvent selection.

Quality Assessment and Authentication of Virgin Olive Oil by NMR Spectroscopy: A Critical free laser desorption ionization as a versatile tool for the chemical characterization of complex mixtures of phenolic compounds Authors Schinkovitz Seine, France; 5Open Innovation Joint Research Laboratory Project Research Center for Fundamantal Science, Graduate Schoolof Science, Osaka University, 1-1 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, 560-0043,Osaka, JapanDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399762 The rapid and precise chemical characterization of complex mixtures of smallmolecules is essential for contemporary natural products '(Nps) research, as well as for the quality control of herbal medicines and dietary supplements.While LC-MS is generally considered as method of rst choice to meet these analytical challenges, the current work will present matrix free laser desorptionionization (LDI) as a versatile supplement or potential alternative to this approach [1, 2]. Among others, particularly phenolic NPs exhibit close structural matrices used in matrix assisted laser desorption ionization. Consequently,these compounds may be ionized by laser irradiation without matrix support.This concept is being outlined by two examples:Therst focuses on the chemical pro ling of propolis obtained from di erent global regions, where high resolution LDI-MS permitted the identi cation of 34 compounds (mostly cinnamic acid and flavonoid derivatives) from a crude ext- ract of French propolis. A contemporaneously performed LC-ESI-MS experimentsolely detected 23 of these compounds. Moreover, LDI-MS facilitated the di e- rentiation of propolis samples according to their origin by principal compoundanalysis (PCA). The second example discusses the LDI-monitoring of the meta-bolic pro les of apple seedlings ( Malus x domestica ) after being treated with various elicitors. Selected plants were further infected by Erwinia amylovora ,t h ecausative agent of re blight. Again LDI-MS permitted the detection of key- metabolites (e.g. ca eic acid, phloridzin, and quer citrine) and also facilitated PCA grouping according to the applied treatment.These results highlight the interesting prospective of LDI-MS as powerful ana-lytical tool and supplement to existing methods.

P-019 NIR spectroscopy in simulation -an e ww a KB1, Grabska tool for qualitative and quantita-tive phytoanalysis. The backbone of NIR spectroscopy, multi-variate data analy-sis, provides no physical insight into the molecular system. In our research [1]we employ the methods of computational chemistry to unveil the origins of NIRbands, and to establish the basic relationship between the wavenumbers in flu- ential in quantitative models, and the und erlying molecular background. Examp- les of substances with importance in phytoanalysis are presented, [2,3] and thymol [4], as prototypic polyphenol and monoterpene.NIR spectra simulations not only provide deep understanding of the spectralbands. In addition, the features of quantitative models obtained in analyticalroutines may be interpreted. Fundamental relationships with the basic factorsmay be established, e.g. how the sensitivity of the molecule to its chemicalenvironment is re flected in the models, and thus an understanding of how these factors a ect the analytical spectroscopy is obtained.

NIR spectra simulation of thymol for better understanding of the spectra forming factors, phaseand concentration e ects and PLS diode-array detection (SFE-SFC-DAD) is a new and innovative analytical tool thatallows fully automated sample preparation followed by chromatographic separa-tion in a single flow path. Among its ecofriendly character, rapid extraction and analysis, as well as reduced arti cial operation errors make it to an interesting approach for natural product analysis [1, 2]. The purpose of this study was toinvestigate its suitability for rapid quality control of commercially available milkthistle preparations. These preparation s are widely used due to hepatoprotective abilities credited to the contained silymarin, an isomeric mixture of flavolignans [3]. During method development, a multitude of parameters associated withthe online coupling of extraction and analysis had to be investigated. A chiralamylose carbamate column was identi ed as ideal stationary phase, as it traps the analytes at the head of the column until the end of the extraction and sub-sequently enables rapid chromatographic separation of the selected B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B).Suited extraction parameters had to be conducted based on their extraction e - ciency and their in fluence on the chromatographic resolution. Best results were obtained by using 20% ethanol as modi er for 15 min, at a temperature of 40\u00b0C and a pressure of 150 bar. Finally, the developed online SFE-SFC-DAD methodhad been applied to the qualitative analysis of di erent milk thistle preparations. With a total runtime of 30 min, including ex traction as well as analysis, the assay provides an interesting approach for further investigations.

The aim of this study was to establish an HPTLC method for identi cation of cranberry-derived ingredients and detection of di erent known adulterants, based on multiple derivatization steps and detection modes.A new HPTLC method was developed. A SPE cartridge was used to removesugars and increase the detectability of flavonoids, catechins and anthocyanins. The new method, featuring a di erent mobile phase, detection modes and 2- derivatization steps, was tested with 52 c ranberry-derived ingredients. Seven known adulterants were included in the analysis: bilberry and blueberry fruits,hibiscus flower, grape seed and skin, peanut skin, and pine bark extracts. Most of the samples show a ngerprint similar to that of cranberry juice. Nine samples of both, pomace and fruit, show no zone due to anthocyanidins. The methodwas capable of distinguishing all adulterants. Two commercial extracts presen-ted zones characteristic for peanut skin and bilberry fruit and lacked cranberryzones. Those adulterations were not detected by HPLC.The use of multiple detection in the HPTLC method allows verifying the iden-tity of cranberry ingredients and also the detection of several types of adulte-ration, without additional chromatography.

It\u00b4s well known that oxidative stress is one of the most important factors for both progression andseverity of colitis, due to an impairment of antioxidant defenses [3]. Here, weevaluated the antioxidant e ect of Chupandilla 's methanolic extract in a DSS- induced colitis.DSS dissolved in drinking water was used for colitis induction on femaleBALB/c mice.Compared to untreated mice with colitis, mice with Chupandilla 's extract presented an increase in survival rate, less severe colitis symptoms like diarr-hea, bleeding and weight-loss.At microscopical level, Chupandilla 's extract greatly reduced loss of crypts architecture and cellular organization and in flammatory in ltrate. In terms of oxidative stress, treated group with extract also showimprovements; antioxidant enzymes likeno loss of activity in colon, while mice presented consi- derable low activities. Chupandilla 's extract prevented activity dual role in both inflammatory and oxidative stress processes during colitis.C. procera extract, presented good in vitro antioxidant capacity, probably due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds, in particular flavonoids, which had been reported and flavonoids identi- ed in C. procera extract.

Using chemometric pre-treatment partialleast square regression (PLSR) models were calculated and quanti ed with cross validation (CV). In the example of silymarin the benchtop device NIRFlex N-500(B\u00fcchi, Flawil, Switzerland) gave the best results both for milled and groundsamples (RMSECV between 0.01 and 0.17%), though the MicroNIR 2200 (ViaviSolutions, Milpitas, USA) provided a similar performance (RMSECV between 0.01 and 0.18%). Resembling results were gained by the microPhazir (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, USA) (RMSECV between 0.01 and 0.23%), only the ground samples gave no satisfactory output.This study proves that NIRS o ers an alternative for the quanti cation of silyma- rin and its flavanonol derivatives.

P-027 Quanti cation of small quantities of a standardized Dry Grape Extract in complete feed using UHPLC-MS/MS Authors Le Suor-Cherer S1,2, FranceDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399772 As p e c i c and sensitive method for quanti cation of small quantities of a standardized Dry Grape Extract in complete feed based on UHPLC-MS/MShas been developed and validated. The standardized Dry Grape Extract stu-died is a natural commercial feed additive (Nor-Grape\u00ae, Nor-Feed, France)used in animal nutrition, consisting of a complex mixture of grape seed ext-racts and grape skin extracts in hasbeen ed and quanti phytomarker for the quanti cation of the additive in feed. Key steps in the preparation of the sample are the use of several successive and selective extractions allowingrstly to eliminate a large number of undesirable molecules and in a second time to recover and concentrate the anthocyanins of the additive present inthe sample. The use of an internal standard (cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside) makes it possible to compensate for the losses of the analyte during sample work-up. M3OG quanti cation is performed by the standard addition method to compensate ion suppression during HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The method was developed and validated in-house in accordance with the gui-delines recommended by IUPAC (selectivity, and linearity, measurement uncertainty) [1] for the quanti cation of a small dose of the standardized Dry Grape Ext- ract in complete feed (30ppm). This patented method of analysis has all theprerequisites to be used by European authorities as part of the registrationof a feed additive [2].

Natu-ral seed oils have received much attention as cosmetic ingredients, dueto the purported folkloric bene ts to the skin. Marula oil is a cold- pressed light-nutty oil included in cosmetics due to the abundance offatty acids. The commercialisation of Marula seed oil as a natural ingre-dient in cosmetic products necessitates the need for quality control pro-cedures to ensure the supply of good e cacious oil. There are currently no standards available for the quality control of Marula seed oils. Hence,the study was undertaken to provide some insight into the chemicalvariation and to investigate the feasibility of using mid-infrared (MIR)spectroscopy as a simple and non-destructive technique for the quanti - cation of the major fatty acids in Marula seed oils. A comparative studywas conducted using 1D and 2D chromatography as reference methods.Spectra of the oil were acquired using a Bruker \u00aeAlpha-P MIR spectro- meter. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were developedbased on MIR data. The calibration models revealed good correlation between the MIR data and 1D-GC values (R2> 0.80). The predictive abi- lity of the models (Q2 cum) was greater than 0.50. In contrast, the corre- lation between 2D-GC and the MIR data was low, with R2values ranging between 0.17 and 0.30. The predictive ability of the models was low(Q 2 cum< 0.50). In this study, MIR spectroscopy was identi ed as a good alternative quality control method, since the technique yielded promi-sing results.

In addition to conventional hydrodistillation and solvent extra-ction methods, there is a green and eco-friendlier method, namely assolvent-free microwave extraction (SFME), can be used for the extractionof aroma plants [1, 2]. The principle of SFME is that microwave canresonate with in-situ water of plant causing tissues to swell and burst without adding any water or solvent and release the essential oil [3]. Inthis study, the leaves and barks of di erent Cinnamomum species were extracted by SFME to obtain the essential oils (CBEOs), and the optimalextraction methods were also discussed. The results showed that themaximum yield of CBEO was 0.75 % at irradiation power 600 W and theextraction time of 30 min.

Its cultivation sites are scattered throughout Chinaand other Asian countries. Processing varies from site to site.

Seventeen authenticated samples were tested but only two samples showed signi cant inhibition (25.38% and 13.23%) without cytotoxicity. With regards to heavy metal concentrations, all24nished products were below with threshold of the Chinese Pharmaco- peia, but also show no activity. Two samples from Chinese online storesexceed acceptable cadmium levels (0.3 and 0.67 mg/kg -1). HPTLC and NMR results suggest that drying straight after harvesting results inhigher levels of tanshinones and salvia nolic acids compared to the traditional processing which includes fermentation in the dark for several days prior to sun-drying.In conclusion, this is the rst study on danshen quality control to use inter- disciplinary metabolomic approach including NMR, HPTLC combined with apharmacological assay. Processing causes huge quality variation among mar-ket samples, especially in tanshinones, resulting in signi cant variation of the biological activity of Danshen.

Kuntze is an East Asian medicinal and aromatic herb rich in bioactive polyphenols, but its phytochemical composi-tion is highly variable.To elucidate potential factors which may cause the variability of the pro-le of pharmacologically useful phenylpropanoids, we studied the phyto- chemical pro le and gene expression in leaves of one-, two- and three- year-old eld grown A. rugosa and their mother plants. Using UHPLC qTOF-MS thirty six di erent polyphenolic compounds were detected in A. rugosa leaves, out of which twelve were quanti ed. The quantities of the three major compounds (rosmarinic acid - RA, apigenin glucoside,chlorogenic acid) di ered signi cantly between plant groups of di erent age and di erent age of a mother plant as con rmed by the PCA and PLS analyses. There was also a close relationship between one-year oldplant groups and their respective progenitors which suggests an exis-tence of a transgenerational phenomenon.Quantitative levels do not re flect concentrations. Among the analyzed phenylpropa- (encoding rosmarinic acid synthase) was ed to be the rate-limiting step for RA biosynthesis in eld grown A. rugosa . Thus, we identi as a putative functional candidate for fur- ther characterisation via i.e. reverse genetic approaches to practically cont-rol rosmarinic acid production.

Lately,environmental and management factors resulted on decreasing of naturalpopulations of Sideritis . Considering the risk of extinction of the species but also the demands of growers and consumers for high quality herbal products thepresent study aimed to evaluate the genetic and chemotypic diversity of S. scar- dicapopulations native to Greece. For this reason ve populations (n = 20 to 25 individuals per population) were colle cted in 2018, from mountainous areas of N. Greece during the flowering period. After the evaluation of population size in situ, intra- and inter-population genetic diversity was determined in individual plants using SCoT molecular markers. High genetic diversity was detected wit-hin the studied populations. Additionally, the populations were highly di eren- tiated based on SCoT markers. The qualitative volatile pro le of the populations was developed through GC-MS analysis after simultaneous steam distillationand solvent extraction of composite herbal samples. Phytochemical analysis determined the presence of hydrocarbon, oxygenated quantitative composition varied among the populations. Ourndings revealed that such diversity could substitute a great genetic pool for the selection of superior germplasm native to Greece for further exploitation indomestication and breeding programs of Sideritis species.

Biosynthesis of these molecules issuppressed in standard laboratory conditions where there are no ecologicaltriggers. Thus, only a portion of the chemical diversity of a microbial strain isdiscovered by standard fermentation protocols. However, using di erent fer- mentation conditions or di erent approaches such as co-culture, biosynthesis of these suppressed molecules can be triggered, and new natural productscan be isolated [2,3].In our previous studies, it was demonstrated that marine derived Streptomy- ces cacaoi had a potent antimicrobial e ect against Enterecoccus feacium and MRSA [4]. A comprehensive statistical optimization of this promising strain was aimed to enrich the chemical diversity of the ethyl acetate extract and toincrease its bioactivity. Response surface methodology was used for statisti- cal optimization of some fermentation paramaters. As responses, the chemi- cal diversities of the ethyl acetate extracts were monitored by HPLC-DADsystem, and the antimicrobial e ects were determined by disc di usion assay onBacillus subtilis . As a result, the diameter of the inhibition zones (150 \u00b5g extract) varied between 6 to 25.5 mm against Bacillus subtilis . Also, chemical proles of the extracts varied even in the major compounds. Consequently, this study demonstrated the importance of optimization protocols for thediscovey of new/novel molecules in microbial natural product research. References [1] Traxler MF, Kolter R.

Orchid mycorrhiza (OM) symbiosisis an excellent model for investigating the biological interactions bet-ween plants and fungi due to their high dependency on these symbiontsfor growth and survival. To capture the complexity of OM interactions,signicant genomic, numerous transcriptomic, and proteomics studies have been performed, unravelling partly the role of each partner. In thisreview, the orchid and mycorrhizal fungus relationship will be describedsummarizing the recent published literature on OM with special atten-tion to the nutrient exchange model, the correlation on tness and dis- tribution of orchid populations, and nally the chemical communication and defense mechanisms. Based on the recent nding on orchids endo- phytes, OM relationship, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and OM similarities[1, 2], a putative model representing the di erent strategies that OM fungi might employ to establish this symbiosis is proposed. It is hypo-thesized here that (i) orchids would excrete signaling molecules such asstrigolactones and flavonoids to facilitate the establishment of the sym- biosis. In response, (ii) OM fungi would secrete mycorrhizal (Myc) factorsto activate the common symbiosis genes, (iii) evade the pathogen asso-ciated molecular patterns triggered immunity and secrete e ectors to overcome the defense mechanism (iv) and nally secrete phytohormones to help the colonization or disrupt the crosstalk of plant defense phyto-hormones. To challenge this supposed model, metabolomics studieswith special attention to each partner contribution are encouraged and some technical approaches are proposed.

However, staple crops are highly water demanding and usuallyrequire tilling and chemical treatments to grow. Furthermore, they rarelyshow a balanced equilibrium between macro and micronutrients, thus impo-verishing people diet.This study focused on the evaluation of the impact of no-tillage practices and water scarcity on the nutritional pro le of cowpea ( edible portions. After harvesting, cowpea seeds and jute mallow leaves were boiled, driedand grinded.Cowpea seeds were evaluated for their total starch, proteins and aminoacidiccontent. Jute mallow leaves were studied for their polyphenolic compositionand folates pro le. These species proved to be an extraordinary source of healthy and nutritio-nally valuable compounds. For instance, HPLC analyses on cowpea seeds sho-wed a relevant amount of aminoacids (4 -33.67 mg*g 1), many of which essential (e.g., threonine and tryptophan). Jute mallow leaves revealed ahuge variety of among which cryptogenic (50 -185 and glycosides (99 -683g*g1), as shown by mass spectrometry analyses. Notably, these phytochemicals were not in fluenced by stress conditions, thus conrming the capability of such species of providing healthy diet also if cul- tivated under conservative agriculture managements. Therefore, these tradi-tional vegetables are good candidates to promote and couple food andenvironmental sustainability of Sub-Saharan agroecosystems.

In the present study, the varia-tion of the phytochemical composition, as well as antiradical and tyrosinase-inhibiting activity of 11 bilberry populations from Croatia (5) and Montenegro(6) was investigated, considering their use for cosmetic purposes. Content ofphenols, flavonoids and phenolic acids, as well as antiradical and enzyme inhibi- ting activity of leaf extracts were determined spectrophotometrically. The con-tent of the most abundant flavonoid, hyperoside, was determined using HPLC with DAD detection. Furthermore, the content of selected metals (K, Ca, Mn, Fe,Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr) was determined using TXRF. excellent antiradical activity (IC 50between 120.8 -11.1 mg/g) -170.9 mg/g). The hyperoside content in the extracts varied between 73.1 and 5.7 mg/g. There was no statistically signi - cant correlation between the content and area of origin. However, the chroma-tograms of extracts from Montenegro could be easily distinguished from theCroatian ones by the presence of an additional peak in chromatogram, which,according to its UV spectrum, represents a quercetin derivative. The observedactivities of bilberry leaf extracts suggest that they might be used in cosmeticproducts. However, before the development of such products, a detailed analy-sis of plant material is advisable in order to select the populations with the hig-hest activity.

With the transcriptomic results during phase of menisporopsin A, non-reducing polyketide synthase (NR-PKS) gene namely men 1 and reducing polyketide synthase (R-PKS) gene namely men 2 are believed to participate in the menisporopsin A biosynthesis. Both genes were cloned into vectors for heterologous expression in Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1 and the transformants were analyzed using metabolites produced were identi ed by NMR, HR-MS and their optical activities. Three major metabolites produced by transforma nts are (-)-orthosporin, (-)-6-hydro- xymellein and structural derivative of menisporopsin A, ascotrichalactone A,which di ers from menisporopsin A only in the presence of a keto group as highlighted in Fig. 1 . Based on these results, we can conclude that the forma- tion of macrocyclic polylactone requires only R and NR-PKSs and trans -acting ketoreductase is needed for the nal step of menisporopsin biosynthesis [1].

A more e cient way to produce car- denolides could be achieved by a yeast-based metabolic engineering approach[1].

Initially, the identi - cation of an AtpMaT1 homologue in Digitalis failed. Therefore, a function-based search for malonyltransferases was performed. One sequence from the Primers were deduced and D. lanata mRNA was used as a template to isolate the respective D. lanata homologues. The attempt yielded a putative Dl21MaT1 sequence which was 94% identical to DpQGMaT1. Meanwhile, we identi ed and cloned three more promising candidate genes from D. lanata . Two recombinant Dl21MaTs were already tested were accepted. However, enzymeactivity was very low (1 %) compared to the recombinant AtpMaT1. Since 21MaT activity is higher in crude protein extracts from leaves of D. lanata than inA. thaliana, we cloned two more Dl21MaT genes that will now be characte- rized with regard to their substrate preferences.

Manuscript in preparation cinerea combined with organic solvents for the generation of novel complex stilbene derivatives Authors 1012, 1260 cinerea enzyme secretome has proven to be an innovative and eective way to produce original derivatives [1]. Such reactions from simple natural stilbenes such as resveratrol and pterostilbene have led tovarious dimerization products, some with interesting biological activities.One of the di culties of the approach is that the reactions take place in water, which is limiting because of the low solubility of NPs in this typeof medium. This may explain the low yields obtained by some reactions.In order to overcome this problem, organic solvents were added to thereaction medium. Several organic solvents such as methanol, isopropa-nol, butanol and isobutanol were examined. The reactions were carriedout at the analytical scale using di erent amounts of each organic sol- vent. UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS pro ling of the crude reaction mixtures revealed the presence of compounds with di erent molecular weights as a function of the organic solvent used. In order to isolate these unusualcompounds, the reactions were optimized, scaled-up and fractionated bysemi-preparatory HPLC with a new dry load injection method to favorhigh resolution fractionation [2]. This approach has enabled the isolationof more than 60 pure compounds fully characterized by HRMS and NMRspectroscopic methods. Surprisingly, some have adopted a solvent mole-cule into their structures, which explains the unusual chemical pro les observed. This fortuitous discovery opened the door to obtaining seriesof derivatives of NPs with great value for biological screeningcampaigns.

To an alyze the triterpenoid saponin biosyn- thetic pathway in using 47 putative enzymes in for and MVApathways) and triterpenoid saponi n biosynthesis. The tissue-speci c expression of selected genes suggests that the leaves of O. elatus are the main site of triter-penoid saponin biosynthesis. In addition , we established cell suspension culture of O. elatus to develop a sustainable source of naturaceuticals. The total saponinproduction in the cell suspension of O. elatus was signi cantly increased by melatonin at 195% at a dose of 100 \u00b5M compared with the mock-treated cont-rol. The expression analysis suggests that the enhanced production of saponinsin melatonin-treated O. elatus is mediated by the increased transcription involved in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis pathway. Taken together,the transcriptome dataset generated in this study will serve as a valuableresource for accelerating genomic and functional genomic research in O. elatus,and our results provide valuable information for improving the production yieldof saponins in plant suspension cultures.

Its major active compounds are carbazole alkaloids,which possessed various alkaloids, and 7-methoxymukonal,are compounds in the callus culture of C. harmandiana [3]. Enhancing the productivity of callus culture can provide an alternativefor carbazole alkaloids production and minimize destructive harvest ofwild-plant materials.To improve the productivity, we tested the e ects of two biotic elicitors, Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum carbazole alkaloids harmandiana callus culture. Antioxidant activity of the callus extracts were also assessed by DPPH and FRAP assays along with total phe-nolic contents.Callus was induced from C. harmandiana leaf explants cultured Murashige and naphtha-leneacetic acid, and 5% sucrose. A B. subtilis culture at 0.1 and 1% (V/V) signicantly enhanced clausine K level in callus up to 5-fold. However, T. harzia- num did not a ect carbazole alkaloids accumulation. In (V/V) B. T. harzianum and FRAP indicated signi cant enhancement activities in callus treated with various concentra- tion of B. subtilis and T. harzianum , which highly correlated to phenolic contents. The established C. harmandiana callus culture and the used of B. subtilis as elicitor is an e cient alternative and sustainable source for production of clausine K with improved antioxidant activities.

The formation in the formation of lycopene, and LYC-B is involved in the formationof-carotene. This study is to elucidate genetic relationship among waterme- lon genotypes with red, yellow or orange flesh color from the whole genome resequencing data. An elevated level of lycopene was noted in all red flesh watermelon lines ranging from 333 to 477 \u00b5g/g, while orange- fleshed water- melons have previously been reported to contain mainly -carotene (91~171 \u00b5g/g), with traces of lycopene and phytoene. In the present study, we selected2369 SNPs with lower PIC values (0.1-0.38) to discriminate 24 genotypes thatexhibited di erent flesh colors. A cluster analysis indicated that red flesh geno- types with a high lycopene content was separated from the non-red flesh inbred lines, such as yellow or orange with a low lycopene content. We rand-omly selected several SNPs on protein coding genes that presented polymor-phism between red flesh and non-red flesh types. Results revealed that these SNP-carrying genes presented preferential and stage-speci c expression bet- ween red and yellow genotypes. The selected SNP-linked to red flesh loci were further validated, and those SNPs were converted into cleavage ampli edpolymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers which allows marker-assisted selection of watermelons with high lycopene content. P-054 How light photoperiod and medium composition could increase the production of apotent anticancer metabolite by 75006 Paris, France; 2Institute for Integrative Cryptophycin-1 is the rst circular depsipeptide which was isolated in 1990 from Nostoc sp. as a tubulin-inhibitor with potential anticanceractivity. The total synthesis of cruptophycin faces stereoselctivity issuesand its yield is only moderate (<13%), and unsuitable for the industrialproduction [1].These considerations provide a rationale to investigate alternative solutions,like stressing the environmental conditions of the culture (ATCC53789) inorder to nd the optimal for the metabolite 's over-production (more than 0.52mg/L of culture) [2]. Here, we examine the e ect of light photoperiod and media 's composition. In light photoperiod we tested 24:0,16:8,12:12,8:16 (Light:Dark). In medium composition, Nitrogen 's concentration was examined to test the implication of heterocysts, a N- xing cell type. The culture was cul- tivated in a light-box, the biomass of a 20ml-sample was extracted and thenmetabolite 's concentration was calculated through HPLC. Lastly, the \"growth/ time \"and \"metabolite 's concentration/time \"curves were drawn. Remarkably, photoperiod has an opposite e ect on the two curves. Regar- ding the growth, the optimal period was 16:8>12:12>8:16>24:0 (Light:Dark),however the inverse happens for the cryptophycin 's production. It is shown that even if the presence of non-light is needed for the cell 's growth, the metabolite 's production is higher under constant light conditions. Regarding the Nitrogen concentration, and so the implication of heterocysts,it was noticed that they were not involved in the depsipeptide 's expression process.These stress-tests 'results contribute on the formation of the optimal culture conditions for the metabolite 's overproduction. That would progress the research and development of the novel potential anticancer drug. References [1] Eissler S, Stoncius A, (22): -3789 J. Production of cryptophycin from blue-green algae.

The main metabolites in biomass (extracts) of both aronias were depsides cryp-tochlorogenic acids (red aronia). The total amounts of PhAs ranged from 290to 661 mg/100gDW and from 194 to 967 mg/100gDW, in black and red aro-nias, respectively. The highest amounts of PhAs were documented after addi- tion of 1 mmol/l and 5 mmol/l of CafA, in black and red aronias, respectively. The obtained results documented that the feeding of culture media with CafAstimulate the high production of depsides with important antioxidant activity.

In contrast, histone deacety-lase (HDAC) removes the acetyl functional groups from the lysine resi-dues of histone tails. This indicates that HATs and HDACs play a role as transcriptional activators or repressors involved in multiple biological processes. Despite the knowledge concerning HATs and HDACs, evolutio-nary and functional information regarding HATs and HDACs in Panax gin-seng are still unknown. In this study, using comprehensive bioinformaticanalyses, we identi ed 13 HATs (PgHATs) and 26 HDACs (PgHDACs) in the P. ginseng genome.

Latest research suggests that cardenolides could also be used in the treatment of various types of cancer [1].Cardiac glycosides are still isolated after extraction from plants. Forachieving higher amounts, e.g., in planta it is fundamental to understand cardenolide biosynthesis. We here focused on the investigation of 3 - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 -HSD) that is supposed to be involved in cardenolide biosynthesis. We screened D. lanata for the occurrence of 3-HSD genes, determined their expression and established RNAi-media- ted knock-down mutants. 3 -HSD knock-down mutants will be further investigated for a direct connection between 3 -HSD expression and car- denolide content.Up to now, two 3 -HSDs ( DlHSD1 [2] and DlHSD2), that share an amino acid sequence identity of 68.9% and a nucleotide sequence identity of 71.5% wereidenti ed. DlHSD2 was recently found by a function-based search in the transcriptome database of D. purpurea [3]. DlHSD2 is isolated, cloned and expressed in E. coli and 3 HSD (oxidation and reduction) activity with pregne- nolone and 5 -pregane-3,20-dion is demonstrated. RNAi mediated knock down of the respective two D. lanata 3-HSDs is veri ed by qPCR and stable transformed shoot cultures are now about to be characterized with regard totheir cardenolide contents.

Telomerase is a reverse transcrip-tase enzyme, and it helps to replenish telomere ends that are truncated byaging and stress factors [1].Telomere shortening is considered not only a result of the biological agingprocess but also a risk factor for many disorders such as neurodegeneration,macular degeneration, coronary artery diseases, hypertension, diabetes, pul-monary brosis. Thus, activation of telomerase enzyme introduces a great promise for the treatment of many chronic and degenerative diseases. Cyc-loastragenol, isolated from Astragalus species, is the only natural product as a telomerase activator in the dietary supplement market. The initiation of clini-cal studies with Cycloastragenol derivatives in Alzheimer 's disease and meta- bolic syndrome is a sign of their potential [2,3,4].Aims of this study were: i) to carry out microbial tissues of Astragalus species ii) to expand our chemical library with new/novel metabolites; iii) to investigate e ects of the metabolites telo- merase activation.As a result, screened in Telomerase PCR ELISA Assay using HEKn cell line. Sixteen compounds increased telomerase acti-vation ranging from 1.2 to 11.3-fold between doses of 0.5 to 300 nM comparedto the control (DMSO).

Both solid and liquid media were found to be e ec- tive for the cell and roots biomass growth. The highest biomass inc-rease of callus cells was recorded on a MS medium supplemented withplant growth regulators such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2.5 \u00b5M). In case oforgan cultures, the largest increase in roots growth was observed onthe MS liquid medium with a reduce d of macro-, and microelements concentration (1/2 MS). Extracts obtained from the in vitro plant mate-rial were examined for the content of triterpene saponins and theirderivatives. The content of several gypsogenin saponosides was con r- med using LC-MS.The applied techniques of G. elegans in vitro cultures were e ective in terms of cell and organ multiplication allowing for obtaining a substantial amountof biomass.

Box 1012, 1260 Nyon, SwitzerlandDOI the Botrytis cinerea enzymatic secretome has proven to be an innovative and e ective way to produce origi- nal derivatives [1]. Such reactions produce very complex compounds from sim-ple natural product sca olds, some of which have interesting biological activities. In the present work, the biotransformation of two 4-hydroxy-cinna-mic acid derivatives was investigated. Ca eic acid and ferulic acid were succes- sively incubated with the (secretome) of B. cinerea . These biotransformations, were rst carried out at the analytical scale for 24 hours. They were monitored by UHPLC-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to verify the complete transformation of starting substrates and the production of related derivatives. The reactions were then scaled-up with 200mg of the starting compounds, controlled by HPLC-PDA-ELSD and puri ed by high-resolution semi-preparative HPLC. The same selectivity and a precise pre-diction of the separation between the analytical and semi-preparative scalewere obtained using geometrical chromatography transfer methods [2]. Theisolated compounds were fully characterized by eleven dimeric or trimeric phenylpropanoids analogues were obtai-ned. Among these compounds, three are described here for the rst time and some of them presented Wnt inhibition activities in breast cancer cells.

To get a better understanding into mechanisms regulating the biosynthesis ofphenolics, roots and leaves of S. yangii and S. abrotanoides collected in three growth stages during the vegetative season were analyzed for non-volatile phe-nolics pro le and key biosynthetic gene expression. The LC- MS analysis sho- wed that in leaves non-volatile phenylpropanoids were exclusively representedby rosmarinic acid while in roots RA and its two derivatives: salvia flaside and salvianolic acid L were found. The accumulation of RA and its derivatives was observed in both -leaf and root tissue, during vegetation season. To enable monitoring the expression of phenylpropanoid biosyntheticgenes, were ampli ed and sequenced. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to investigate the expression pattern of ampli ed biosynthetic genes. We used a comparative analysis of phytochemical and gene expression pro ling to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms underpinning biosynthesis of non-volatile phenylpropanoids in S. yangii and S. abrotanoides during a vegeta- tive season.

STW-5 was predigested by means of the static in-vitro digestion model InfoGest [1] to mimic the conditions in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Thereafter, the pre-digested STW-5 was incubated with 10% stool suspension under (physiological after and 24h of incubation, in order to inves-tigate the changes of the metabolic pro les caused by gut microbial metabo- lization of STW-5 by UHPLC-HRMS metabolomics, and to detect shifts in themicrobial community composition occurring upon incubation with STW-5 the composition of STW-5. While phenolic constituents like liquiritin were completely degraded after30min by the human stool slurries, residual amounts of the triterpene glyco-side glycyrrhizic acid (2-13% of initial levels) were still detectable in 4 of 10samples after 24h. Metabolites like davidigenin became detectable after30min or 4h and decreased again in 7 samples after 24h, indicating their fur-ther metabolization. The microbiome composition of the 10 samples wasvery heterogenous, indicating that microbiome shifts caused by STW-5depend on the individual donor 's gut microbiome.

The obtained new liposomewas tested for its carrier properties, loading a natural active molecule,berberine chloride (BRB HCl). BRB is an isoquinoline alkaloid used in theTraditional Chinese Medicine from the ancient times, because of itsseveral therapeutic properties [2]. Di erent liposomes made of ESN and loaded with BRB HCl were prepared according to the thin-layer evapora-tion method. All liposomes showed an high -potential, a low polydisper- sity index and spherical shape, by light scattering analysis andmicroscope observation, respectively. The dialysis bag method, followedby HPLC-DAD analysis, was used in order to determine the EncapsulationEciency (EE) and to investigate the in vitro release of BRB HCl and ESN, with the following results: the EE 67% for BRBHCl and 94% for ESN.

The objective of thisstudy was to develop lipid nanocarriers as drug delivery systems to inc-rease gastro-intestinal absorption of lupinifolin extracted from Albizia cation-soni cation of loaded with lupinifolin, LSLN, LNLC, and LNE, were success-fully synthesized. The lipid components chosen to formulate nanacarrierswere Dynasan\u00ae116 and/or medium chain triglyceride. Physicochemicalcharacterizations along with releasing pro les of lupinifolin-loaded lipid nanocarriers were compared. It was found that the best lipid nanocar-riers for lupinifolin was LNLC, which demonstrated the particle size of151.5 \u00b1 0.1 nm, monodispersity distribution with PdI of at 41.2 \u00b1 0.7 mV, high encapsulation (99.3%), and high loading capacity (5.0%). The obtained LNLC exhibited prolonged releasein simulated circulatory system, but produced low release in gastro-intestinal condition (3.7%). Intestinal permeability of the nanocarrierswas further evaluated in everted intestinal sacs method. The resultsfrom the ex vivo study indicated that LNLC signi cantly increased the absorption, compared to native lupinifolin. Lupinifolin absorption throughLNLC was about 16 times higher than the native form. In conclusion,lupinifolin-loaded lipid nanocarriers were successfully formulated as deli-very systems to enhance its oral bioavailability. Further in vivo experi-ments are needed to validate the results from this study. References [1] Prasad SK, Laloo D, Kumar M et al.

However, they are poorly soluble in water, unstable and suscep-tible to degradation. Encapsulation of EOs in di erent nanocarriers represents a valid strategy to overcome these limitations as well as to enhance their biologicalactivity [1, 2]. The present study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial potential ofliposomally-encapsulat ed phenol rich EOs from T. longicaulis C. Presl, T. pulegioi- desL. and T. vulgaris L. originating from Croatia. The commercial T. vulgaris EO was used for the optimization of liposomes 'composition and preparation proce- dure. Based on the high encapsulation of EO and satis ed physical properties achieved, liposomes containing 20 mg/mL of soy phosphatidylcholine, 2 mg/mLof cholesterol and 5 mg/mL of EO were selected as optimal for testing the anti-bacterial activities against S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli .T h em e a nd i a m e t e r so f liposomes were 187 -216 nm with polydispersity indexes from 0.43 to 0.53, while encapsulation e ciency varied between 51% and 57%. The obtained mini- mal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were in the range 0.25 -2m g / m L .E n c a p s u - lation of the Thymus EOs in liposomes improved their solubility, stability and enhanced their antibacterial activities exhibiting MICs two-fold lower than the MICs of the corresponding pure EOs against S. aureus and E. coli . Liposomally- encapsulated T. longicaulis EO demonstrated the strongest antibacterial e ect showing four-fold increase of activity against E. faecalis , thus indicating its poten- tial use as biopreservative natural remedy.

PHOSAL\u00ae contain soybean phosphatidylcholine in sun flower oil and can be used as carriers for lipophilic and amphiphilic APIs. In order to optimize theformulation, distribution, -potential values, entrapment eciency and drug release. The prepared formulations exhibited mean particle size from 120 -200 nm, PDI values ranging between 0.117 - 0.269 and -potential ones ranging from 11 to 18 mV. Further- more, the API loading ranged between 3.12 -5.98%, while entrapment eciency reached 70%. The in vitro release was measured at phosphate buer saline (pH 5.5 with 1% SDS) using UV spectrophotometry at 519 nm, as shown in Fig. 1 .T h e s e ndings are considered promising and could be used for further design of dermal nanocarriers using PHOSAL \u00ae40 IP.

However, the low aqueous solubility andpoor oral bioavailability limit its clinical use. To overcome these drawbacks,two novel nanomicellar formulations were developed. Polymeric nanomi-celles made of Soluplus and mixed nanomicelles combining Soluplus withVitamin E TPGS were obtained by the thin lm method. The solubility of silymarin increased by ~ 6-fold when loaded into nanomicelles. Further-more, both formulations were chemically and physically characterized interms of average diameter, homogeneity, zeta potential, morphology,encapsulation e ciency, drug loading, critical micellar concentration and cloud point. Nanomicelles showed sizes of ~ 60 nm and polydispersityindex 0.1. The encapsulation e ciency was 92% indicating the high a nity between silymarin and the core of the nanomicelles. The physical and che-mical parameters of SLM-loaded formulations stored at room temperatureand in refrigerated conditions were monitored over three months. Stabilityand release studies in media mimicking physiological conditions were con-ducted. A DPPH assay was performed with arti cial membranes micelles increased the intestinal absorption of SLM.

P-076 Study of disturbed metabolism correction in tumor cells treated by combination of iron oxide nanoparticles and Limonium extract Authors known that metabolic pathways are tightly key signs of malignant tumor: heterogeneity, metast asis, reprogramming of the cellular environment. The aim of the work was to study the correction of metabolicdisorders of the experimental tumor (sarcoma 45) with the help of the extractfrom the Limonium gmelinii roots [1]. As previously shown, iron oxide nanopar- ticles are able to reactivate immune cells [2], so, we synthesized them in ourextract.Growth of sarcoma 45 was accompanied by a sharp increase in the con-tent of lactic acid (LA) in almost all analyzed organs. Signi cant decrease from 17.04 to 0.3 mmol/g after Limonidin application was found in thekidneys, 1.5 times decrease noted in the liver and 2 -3 times decrease in the lungs, heart and skeletal muscle. Limonidin contributed to the resto-ration of normal LA content in most of the internal organs, especially inthe parenchymal organs -in the kidneys, liver and spleen. Tumor growth was characterized by a decrease in the content of pyruvic acidby 50-60% in the liver and heart of tumor carriers, and in the kidneysand lungs its content decreased by 30-50% with insigni cant fluctuations in the spleen. It was noted that Limonidin contributes to an increase inthe content of pyruvic acid in the liver, spleen and muscles by 30-40%,in the tumor -by 70%, in the lungs, heart and kidneys -by 2 -4.2 times. Based on our results, we may say that the drug corrects the dis- turbed metabolism of tumor cells. References [1] State Pharmacopeia of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

However, herbaria specimens are under special protection and often phyto-chemists are not allowed to take samples for chemical analysis Therefore,only little is known about the stability of polyphenol compounds in plantmaterial stored for decades or even centuriesIn this study, we employed Matrix Solid-Phase Dispersion (MSPD) procedures[1] to prepare extracts for HPLC analysis using as little as 100 mg of plantmaterial from up to 50-years old samples of Polygonum aviculare . The one step extraction with C18 silica gel as dispersing phase in pro-portion of 1:4 of herbal material eluted with methanol was su cient to obtain repeatable pro les comparable to classical solvent extraction. The major flavonoids such as quercetin-, myricetin- and kaempferol-glycosi- des were well preserved in most of the 20 analyzed herbarium samplesas compared to the freshly prepared material from validated Polygoni avi- cularis herba . 100 mg of plant material was enough for extraction and did not provoke signi cant damage to the specimens.

Common cases of adulteration include the admixture of fatty oils or high-boi-ling glycols, the addition of speci c compounds or of (fractions of) similar but cheaper essential oils [1]. Physicochemical properties like relative density,refractive index and optical rotation outside certain limits for rose oil speci-ed in ISO 9842 indicate crude adulterations. Invisible under GC conditions usually applied for rose oil volatiles, the admix-ture of fatty oils or other non-volatiles after transes-terication, high-temperature GC polysiloxane as isopropyl acid ratios of chiral compounds are highly speci c for an essential oil, chirality evaluation of linalool, -citronellol, and cis/trans rose oxide is also used as a powerful tool in authenticity control of rose oil [2], and the ratio ofR/Slinalool in the present study was found to be 1.2, whereas -citronellol is solely found in its S-conguration. Most signi cant, the ratios of major constituents in rose oil and typical minor compounds (not or hardly available as isolates or individual compounds) pro-ved to be an appropriate authenticity criterion, and uncommon values werefound to be diagnostic for adulteration with major constituents.Finally, NIR spectroscopy combine d with chemometrics using cluster analysis covering data from in-hou se quality control of >100 batches provides an additional tool for genuineness and purity controlpurposes.

It is usually cultivated at an altitude between 300 -1500 m ASL. Having favorable edaphic and cli- matic conditions, Turkey and Bulgaria are the main rose oil producers in theworld, followed by Morocco, Iran and a couple of a few other countries pro-ducing smaller quantities [1].Dierent agrometeorological and technological conditions in these countries result in varying chemical compositions of the respective rose oils [2]. In the present study the chemical composition of 154 batches, originating from Turkey, Bulgaria, Iran, Ethiopia and Afghanistan, were evaluated. Essential oilcomposition was analyzed by GC-FID using surface-bonded polyethylene gly-col as stationary phase.Major constituents of the eleoptene fraction were found to be the acyc-lic monoterpene alcohols - citronellol, geraniol and nerol .W h i l e -citro- nellol content was similar in all the oils investigated (30.3%-32.6%), geraniol and nerol contents were highest in oils from Afghanistan (23.7% and 12.7%, respectively) but lowest in Ethiopian oil (16.6% and 7.2%, res-pectively). The stearoptene fraction predominantly consisting nonadecane (C 19)a n d heneicosane (C21) was highest in Ethiopian rose oils (19.8% for C 19+C 21), followed by rose oils from Iran (14.4% for C 19+C 21). Since the roses in Ethiopia and Iran grow at much higher altitudes the higher stearoptene content in these oils couldbe explained by a thicker cuticular wax layer preventing rose petals fromevaporation of water and document was downloaded for personal use only.

PMFs appear to have a broad spectrum of activities, including anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities. Consequently, they have big potential to be developed as therapeutic agents or dietary supplements [1-3].The pro le and yield of PMFs is di erent for each Citrus species. Seven di e- rent species were pro led using UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. The generated data were analyzed using GNPS Molecular Networking [4]. At least 30 di erent PMFs were identi ed. As the yield of PMFs is di erent for every Citrus species, a generally applicable HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated according to the ICH guide-lines [5] to quantify the amount of nobiletin and the total amount of PMFs. Acalibration model of the external standard nobiletin (1.51 - 150.90 \u00b5g/mL)showed a good linear response (R 2> 0.999). The method displayed a good intermediate precision on time and concentration levels, for both nobiletin asthe total amount of PMFs. The recovery of the method was 99.3% fornobiletin.Analysis of the seven samples showed qualitative and quantitative di erences in the composition of PMFs in the respective species. While C. limon contai- ned the lowest amount of total PMFs, C. depressa contained the highest amount. Qualitative analysis revealed the most broad variety of di erent PMFs in C. depressa , as well as in C. reticulata and C. reticulata x C. sinensis . This makes them interesting sources of PMFs for future development of therapeu- tic agents or dietary supplements.

The RC 50values (concentration required for a 50% reduction of radicals) of the water extract and ascorbic acid were 556.7\u00b113.0g/mL and 103.4\u00b12.6 g/mL, respectively. The analysis of the extract using ultra-high -performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of- flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS) revealed eight compounds. Amongthem, only the peak area of quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside was found todecrease in a concentration-dependent manner following the DPPP and FVereaction. Mechanism has not been elucidated yet, but there are many reportsthat the reaction of DPPH with antioxidants leads to a decrease in the HPLCpeak.

The aim ofour study was the establishment of an integrated high-throughput multivariatestatistics platform, relying on FCPC, HPTLC, and NMR, for the direct detectionand identi cation of natural compounds with ski n whitening properties prior to any isolation. Greek flora - due to its high biodiversity - was used as a source for the collection of selected plant material. Previous in vitro investigation of plant extracts against their tyrosinase inhibiti on activity revealed nine extracts as the most promising. The selected extracts were fractionated by FCPC using a certainprotocol and each fraction was split in 3 equal parts for: i) HPTLC pro ling and bioautography, ii) NMR pro ling iii) in vitro assay. An integrated HPTLC-based procedure for the tracing of compounds t hat contributed to tyrosinase inhibi- tory e ect in active fractions was established with the use of multivariate data analysis [1]. Additionally, NMR spectral data were correlated with the results oftyrosinase activity resulting in the identi cation of bioactive compounds through the combination of the Heterocovariance approach (HetCA) [2] and the statisti-cal data derivingfrom NMR and HPTLC correlated to the biological activity by approach, revealed flavans, flavonols, phenolic compounds and stilbe- noids between the most promising whitening agents, providing a major reduc-tion in workload by direct use of routine information.

Cichorium spinosum (\"stamnagkathi \") is a highly valued and extensively consumed endemic plant of the Mediterranean region [1]. Preli-minary studies exploring C. spinosum 'seect in Drosophila melanogaster diet, have demonstrated the extract 's ability to enhance the proteasome activity and to activate the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway [2].In the present study, an extensive characterization of the decoction 's chemi- cal pro le was performed using UPLC-HRMS & HRMS/MS. The extract was found to be rich in simple phenolic acids, lactones, hydroxycinnamic acids, aswell as in flavonoid glucuronides. In parallel, an untargeted metabolomics protocol was developed using a UPLC-ESI-Orbitrap in order to further investi- gate the e ects of the addition of C. spinosum 's extract on D. melanogaster diet. The characterization of D. melanogaster endogenous metabolites was followed by the analysis of several fly samples whose diet had previously been enriched with C. spinosum 'sdecoction at di erent concentrations. This approach enabled the identi cation of signi cant metabolites leading to the exploration of certain biological pathways modulated by the C. spinosum 's extract.Our results indicate that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectro-metry in combination with the model organism D. melanogaster [3] in the concept of metabolomics can be considered as a valuable tool for determi-ning the e ects of natural products on complex biological systems.

The recent deve-lopment of untargeted metabolomics o ers new tools to address this problem.Computational solutions have been developed to optimally exploit suchuntargeted tandem mass spectrometry data. Spectral similarity, deducedfrom the cosine score, and substructure-linked spectral motifs [2] are notablyfocusing on metabolite organization and annotation.In this study, we take advantage of these tools to obtain structural and spectralrelationships, which will allow us to classify species (considered here as com-plex ensembles of molecules). We postulate that the biosynthetic relationshipsbetween the chemical features can be inferred from the cosine scores andspectral motifs, which in turn help to classify the producing organisms. We usespectral motifs to compute a modi ed Junker 's BioSynthetically Informed Dis- tance expanding its scope to non-annotated features [3]. Furthermore, wecombine it with the weighted Chemical Structural and Compositional Simila-rity distance [4, 5], introducing a new Structural and Substructural SimilarityInformed Distance. Results produced by this method on 32 specimens of thegenus Usnea (lichenized Ascomycetes) seem to e ciently re flect the phylogeny established by multilocus analysis. We further applied this metric to classify169 specimens of Usnea lacking genetic information. These tools should e ciently complement the set of approaches currently used to classify living organisms, which mainly so far rely on morphologicaland genetic characters.

In recent decades,the use of A/S has seen a resurgence and A/S have risen to a pivotal role aspharmaceutical and cosmeceutical agents, since they possess strong wound healing, antimicrobial, anti-in flammatory, tissue regenerative and antitumor properties. It is thus crucia l to enhance the biosynthesis of bio- active A/S in Alkanna tinctoria plants, that naturally produce high amounts of these metabolites [1].In the frame of \"MICROMETABOLITE \"EU H2020 project, we have optimi- zed a work flow for the metabolic pro ling of A. tinctoria roots, cultured in the greenhouse from plants obtained by in vivo shoot cuttings. A fast and reliable extraction procedure was achieved for comprehensive pro ling and identi cation of A/S and other metabo lites biosynthesized in the roots. The aim of this work was to determine the growth stage with peakA/S production, while simultaneously o btaining additional information on the root metabolome. A for reliable quantitation A/S and the extracts were subjected to chiral for deter-mination derivatives and other metabolites were identi in plant roots using UHPLC-HRMS and NMR.

Direct Injection-Electron Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (DI-EI-MS) [1] and NMR are comprehensive and powerful tools for such analyses,because they allow the simultaneous detection of diverse groups in bothprimary and secondary metabolites. We were able to select blueberry spe-cies whose leaves have anti-proliferative e ect in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, by DI-EI-MS- and NMR-based metabolomic techniques It is wellknown that Rhubarb species have also anti-proliferative e ect in several cancer cells. However, the active constituents in Rhubarb species are notfully identi ed. In the present study, we assessed if constituents in Rhubarb species have anti-proliferative e ect in ATL cells. Furthermore, we also tried to distinguish the Rhubarb species having better anti-proliferative e ect in ATL cells from the other Rhubarb species. Methanol extracts from roots orleaves of some Rhubarb species showed anti-proliferative e ect in ATL cells. Therefore, DI-EI-MS- and NMR-based metabolomics can be used to classifybioactive extracts. Principal component analysis of the extracts interpretedfrom the loading plot analysis showed that each extract had unique ionpeaks or chemical shifts. This unique information observed in Rhubarb spe-cies were associated with high anti-proliferative e ect in ATL cells. These results suggest that Rhubarb species could be classi ed based on the results of metabolite pro ling with DI-EI-MS and NMR.

Endophytes have proven to be a promising source of bioac-tive natural products with interesting structural diversity. In the present study,the secondary metabolites of the endophytic fungi Fusarium solani was investiga- ted. This fungus was isolated from the rhizomes of the marine herbaceous plantPosedonia oceanica harvested in the Mediterranean Sea. The ethyl acetate extract ofF. solani presented antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to isolate the compounds responsible for these activities, the culture of F. solani was up-scaled and puri ed by semi-prep. HPLC.

Alternative drug targets such as anti-quorum sensing (AQS) have been identi ed as possible ways to reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. The aim of the research was to investigatethe AQS activity of 40 commercial essential oils against Chromobacterium viola- ceum and identify potentially active constituents using an untargeted metabolo- mics approach. Chemical pro ling of the oils was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied to the data in SIMCA-P+ 14.0, to investigate correlation between AQS activity and the essential oil chemistry. Possible biomarkers were identi ed using the S-plot. The essential oils with noteworthy AQS activity (percentage inhibition 90%) at as putative biomarkers that may be associated with the activity observed. The results demonstrate theability of essential oils to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing thus providinga possible alternative drug target to co mbat infections. Furthermore, with the aid of chemometrics, it was possible to identify potential bioactive constituentsin essential with defense strategy against herbivo- res and pathogens [1], so their production may depend by a particular bioticpressure. The variation of these alkaloids can be exploited to detect promptlybioactives in extracts through integration of chemical and biological activitydatasets using supervised statistics. Thus, several accessions of Genisteae plants (from di erent locations in Bogot\u00e1 plateu) w ere investigated through a compre- hensive targeted GC/MS-based metabolomics approach in order to explore thequinolizidine variation between sample set and its implication on antifungalactivity against Fusarium oxysporum . Quinolizidine-enriched extracts were obtai- ned Genisteae plants (n>66) by means of ultrasound-assisted acid- base extraction. Resulting extracts were separately tested against F. oxysporum, through amended-medium method in 12-well plates at 0.1-500 g/mL, and mycelial growth inhibition was then recorded. Chemical di erences in extracts were examined by partial-least squares (PL S) discriminant analysis using MS fea- tures data (retrieved from GC/MS pro les using MZmine 2.37). Single- YPLS was also used to integrate the chemical and biological datasets. Extracts showedantifungal capacity at di erent levels (2>IC 50(\u00b5g/mL)>55). PLS-DA indicated several di erences between samples and cluste red according characteristic che- mical constituents and/or activity. Single- YPLS analysis evidenced three aphyl- line-like compounds to be related to antifungal activity (AUC>0.9), which wereconrmed by independent (IC 50>3 \u00b5g/mL). This chemical and antifungal activity integration led to the rapid detection of bioactive quinoli zidines in extracts improving the e ciency during antifungals discovery against F. oxysporum.

So far, several in vivo studies and experimen- tal models investigate the e ect of olive oil (OO) biophenols and particular hydroxytyrosol (HT), a strong antioxidant entity of OO, in these metabolicdiseases [2]. Promising results have been uncovered and nowadays researchfocuses on the exploration of HT e ects on human metabolome. In this study two di erent UPLC-HRMS platforms were incorporated for the quanti cation of HT in human biological fluids and the identi cation of metabo- lites-biomarkers thereof, after the administration of an encapsulated biophenols extract enriched in HT. In particular, urine and blood samples were collected inthree time points from 30 overweight/obese women, randomized in HT/day, B-5mg HT/day, C-placebo). After investigation and application of the appropriate extraction protocols, aUPLC-triple-quadrupole method was developed for HT detection and quanti ca- tion, using multiple reaction monitoring mode and suitable collision energies. Successively, extracts were subjected to untargeted metabolomics via UPLC-Orbitrap-MS in negative and positive io nization mode using full scan and data- depending methods. After pre-treatment, data were subjected to multivariatestatistical analysis assisted by chemometric tools. Well-de ned groups were revealed and statistical signi cant metabolites-biomarkers were identi ed among groups. The detected HT concentration were correlated with the identi-ed biomarkers and the corresponding weight loss of each group. Signi cant interrelations were observed associating HT administration with certain trendsand metabolic markers.Acknowledgements Author would like to thank IKY document was downloaded for personal use only.

Nowadays, it iswell known that can be also applied, among others, in cosmetics, foodindustry and environmental engineering [1,2]. However, due to its high eco-nomic importance authenticity and adulteration are major issues mainlytowards geographical and botanical origin. It should be noted that the sugarshave been mainly studied, though limited studies are focused on other polarmetabolites, especially phenols, which are related not only with geographical but mainly with botanical origin. Many methodologies based on liquid chro- matography, and lately, NMR have been used towards this scope. The aim ofthis study was to analyze Greek honeys and draw conclusions about theirauthenticity. Special attention was given to their content in phenolic com-pounds. Honeys were collected from di erent islands of the northern east Aegean Sea in Greece Efstratios, Ikaria, Chios and erent herbal origin. Extraction procedure pre- viously reported [3] was carried out with slight modi cations. The pro les of the extracts were obtained with both LC-HRMS and NMR. Dereplicationbased on high resolution mass spectra gave information about the composi-tion of the di erent honeys, while in NMR pro ling in combination with mul- tivariate data analysis enabled the classi cation of samples. Moreover, signicant markers responsible for the observed clusters were identi ed. Finally, statistical data correlations from both platforms are in progress.

Despite the numerous studies achieved on orchid extractscharacterization by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) strategies [1], there is a lack of available experimental MS frag-mentation patterns that tremendously complicate the dereplication processwithin this plant family.Molecular networking (MN) has the potential to speed up the dereplicationprocess by highlighting structural analogues within the sample but alsoacross di erent samples [2]. In this context, we expose here a dereplication strategy based on LC-HRMS/MS and MN representation for orchid extracts characterization.Three orchids extracts have been dereplicated and implemented inmolecular networks together. Two of them are from well-known studiedorchids (species A from Gastrodia and B from Dendrobium genus) to assist the dereplication of the third one from another poorly studiedorchid species (C).11 molecules were putatively identi ed in the extract of species A and 5 molecules in the extract of species B. The method was tested by comparingsome identi ed compounds (gastrodin; with their MN representation highlighted the identi cation of various adducts and analogues compounds among the three speciesextracts by establishing clusters or nodes according to fragmentation similarities.As a result, the method is satisfactory, and MN seems to be a promising com-plementary step to assist the dereplication of plant extracts, especially whenthe sample of interest is compared with well characterized samples.

However, little is known about the activecompounds and the mechanism of action. [1,2] Previous phytochemicalresearch on Herniaria species revealed the presence of saponins, flavo- noids and coumarins. [2] It is suggested that of phytochemi-cals present in H. hirsuta (most likely saponins) are responsible for the benecial e ects. In vitro gastrointestinal biotransformation followed by automated data analy- sis was optimized using hederacoside C as a model compound for saponins.Samples were analyzed with UHPLC-PDA-HRMS before, during and afterbiotransformation.To analyze the longitudinal LC-MS data, XCMS and EDGE were used to extractsignicant di erential pro les from the raw data.

The work flow revealed the biotransformation of hederacoside C. All major metabolites were ranked inthe top 100 out of 10307 features.When subjecting an extract of H. hirsuta to the experimental work flow, her- niariasaponin H, the most abundant saponin, showed stepwise elimination sugar moieties resulting in medicagenic acid.

Results of a metabolic (UPLC- MS/MS, MRM) analysis of taxane content of two populations (Mt Cholo-mon, Mt. Olympus) showed no signi cant di erences in paclitaxel pro- duction, but the docetaxel and paclitaxel DAB was signi cantly higher Mt Cholomon by 29.83%. Higher yielding paclitaxel trees (HYT)appear to be lower yielding in DAB at the population level: the 10 pacli-taxel HYT of Mt. Cholomon produced 25% less that the 10 HYT of Mt.Olympus, while the 10 DAB HYT trees of the former produced 14%more than the 10 HYT of the latter. Populations presented taxane con-centrations on the low end of the range reported in the literature (pacli- taxel 1.1 -5.7 mg 100 -1g dw; DAB 12.7-81.1 dw). Notable levels of (SSR) and epigenetic (MSAP) diversity were found inboth populations; the former were lower though than values reported inother relevant studies for Taxus (SSR). Preliminary analyses on the rela- tions of genetic and epigenetic diversity to HYT and LYT for both taxa-nes were inconclusive. This analysis presents a rst insight regarding the potential of future commercial exploitation of these genetic resourcesfor taxol production.

Given the complexity of natural matrices and the considerable workrequired to isolate pure compounds, targeting potentially active compoundsprior to isolation allows considerable savings of time and resources.We previously proposed bioactivity based multi-informative Molecular Net- work (MN) as a strategy to prioritize high-value natural products [1]. In thisrespect, we recently performed a massive metabolite pro ling of a set of bio- diverse extracts (1,600 plant extracts: 783 species, 533 genera and 156 fami-lies) from the library of plant parts from Pierre Fabre Laboratories madeavailable through a collaboration. Integration of LC-MS/MS based dereplica-tion annotations, combined with the bioactivity results mapping on three try-panosomatids and toxicity assessment, allows highlighting potentiallybioactive sca olds within the extracts library. Based on this comprehensive MN oriented prioritization [2], a targeted isolation of potentially active mole-cules was performed.As a proof of concept, we were able to annotate and highlight in the MNMelochia umbellata quinoline alkaloids derivatives such as waltherione G, a known trypanocidal compound [3]. Using highlighteddiphyllin derivatives speci ct oa Rotula aquatica extract. We then proceeded to an e cient one step targeted isolation using semi-preparative HPLC with dry-load injection of the crude extract leading to the puri cation of ten com- pounds including ve diphyllin derivatives [4]. In conclusion, we demonstrate that coupling dereplication strategies, bioacti-vity information mapping and e cient semi-preparative HPLC isolation grants a direct access to speci c and potentially active NPs from a large and chemodiverse plant collection.

Nowadays, the resin, a PDO product, hasbeen well-studied and showed antimicrobial, anti-in flammatory, and other activities [1]. However, the fruit and leaves of Pistacia lentiscus L. shrub from Chios have not been thoroughly investigated and additionally, they are dis-carded as considered by-products of the mastic tree cultivation.In continuation of our research [2], this study emphasises on the exploration ofthe biological properties of P. lentiscus leaves and fruit collected from the region of Mastichochoria. Leaves (36 samples) and fruit (89 samples) were collectedfrom di erent altitudes and distance from t he sea (Fig. 1) during the maturing period. All samples were extracted with various NMR solvents and their NMRmetabolic pro ling spectra were acquired. In parallel, their antioxidant capacity as well as their enzyme inhibition properties (tyrosinase, elastase, collagenase,hyaluronidase) related to skin whitening , moisture and elasticity were evaluated. Finally, NMR spectral data were processed with SIMCA software (Umetrics) andmultivariate statistical analysis (PCA, OPLS-DA) was used to ev aluate the quality characteristics of the samples and to identify potential biomarkers. Thisapproach resulted in the detection of more than 40 spectral features (biomar-kers) in all of the extracts and facilitated the classi cation of samples. To the best of our knowledge, this research e ort is the rst to study the NMR-based chemical pro ling of P. lentiscus leaves and fruit from di erent regions of Chios and correlate their enzyme inhibition a ctivity by Multivariate Data Analysis.

While plenty ofinformation is available on mammalian EVs, our knowledge on plant EVsremains little. Their e ects on human body are currently being investigated, while it is still unexplored how EV lipids vary between distinct species or whe-ther secondary metabolites such as polyphenols or alkaloids are packagedinto plant derived EVs. Due to manifold di erences in plant families, regar- ding secondary metabolites and structural characteristics, the lipid composi-tion of EV membranes probably also varies. In order to get insight into thelipid composition of EVs, an extraction method was developed and lipophiliccompounds pro led by TLC. In general, EV fractions, isolated by di erential centrifugation, were shown to enrich the added membrane dye 3,3 -Dihexy- loxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC 6) minary data suggest phosphatidylserine to be present in EV preparations from Hypericum perforatum L. and Viscum album L. It is still puzzling how plant EVs act in gastrointestinal environment. Since secondary metabolitessuch as polyphenols have the potential to inhibit gastrointestinal enzymes [2]and thereby prevent EV degradation, we investigated if secondary metaboli-tes are packaged into EVs. Although TLC analysis revealed the abundance ofseveral not yet identi ed structures, nicotine was absent in EV preparations from Nicotiana tabacum L. callus culture.

In the case ofindustry, reliable analyses are crucial for quality assessment of a nal product. Current analytical methods mainly focus on the quantitationof speci c and often non-bioactive markers of plant extracts. Therefore, ecient procedures are needed to pr ovide an exhaustive analysis of the metabolome composition of a natural extract, addressing qualita-tive and quantitative aspects. We argue that combining semi-quantita-tive data with the ngerprint of minor metabolites could improve quality, authenticity, origin or toxicity assessments. In the context ofsuch original classi c a t i o n ,w eu s e du n t a r g e t e dU H P L C - H R M S / M S - b a s e d metabolomics, which is a qualitative and highly sensitive approachtogether with semi-quantitative detection based on ELSD. Four knownmedicinal plants of industrial inter est containing Aloe were selected as model. After a generic untargeted work- flow, we mined the data to extract relevant information, using taxo- nomy and chemometric approaches to query in silico annotated Molecular Networks (MN). [1,2] This allowed the rapid and con dent annotation of 23% of 16 624 MS2 spectra from diverse specialized metabolites. Mapping semi-quantitative information on the networksalso provided a preliminary global evaluation of their relative abun-dance within the extract. With both qualitative and quantitative datacombined, enriched molecular networ ks represent relevant and detailed compositional information on natural extracts from a genericperspective.

To isolatediverse natural selaginellin derivatives, we applied a MS/MS based molecularnetworking strategy enhanced by in silico structural annotation to the Selagi- nella tamariscina extracts. It led to the prioritization of chromatographic peaks predicted as previously unknown selaginellin derivatives. As a result,we could isolate ten unknown compounds containing two unusual selaginel-lin analogs with 1 H,3H-dibenzo[ de,h]isochromene skeleton named selariscins ( with eight diaryl fluorene derivatives, selaginpulvilins M T(310). The absolute con gurations were elucidated by computational electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectral calculations.

This study evaluated the content of ve diterpenes found in the needles of 130 T. baccata trees belonging to three populations from di erent mountai- nous areas and one ex-situ collection, as an alternative source of taxanes. In order to assess the chemodiversity of the populations, fresh needles were collec-ted in August from second and third year stems/branches with northern expo-sure from each tree and freeze-dried.

The residueswere dissolved in 1 ml methanol and ltered into glass vials. An analytical method was developed using external standards for quanti cation, according to Kobusiak-Prokopowicz et al. (2016) and validated to quantify paclitaxel, 10-dea-cetylbaccatin (DAB), 10-diacetyltaxol (DAT), baccatin III and (MRM).

Considering taxonomy when exploring natural products thus appears as an evidence. Such principles were already formulated in 1816 byDe Candolle who postulated that 1) Plant taxonomy would be the most useful guide to man in his search for new industrial and medicinal plants and 2) Chemi- cal characteristics of plants will be most valuable to plant taxonomy in the future . [1] We adhere to De Candolle 's postulate and aim to establish their validity using computational approaches.Regarding the rst postulate, we show that the consideration of taxonomic position is bene cial in the metabolite annotation process leading to a syste- matic improvement (> 50% of correct annotation at rank 1) of current in e ciently improves the natural products drug discovery process and should complement orthogonal infor-mation already shown to strengthen classical spectral scoring systems. [3,4]Regarding the second postulate, we demonstrate the interest of consideringthe chemical dimension (structural or spectral relationships) when seeking toorganize plants or lichens extracts. We present a novel metric, Spectral andSubstructural Similarity- Informed Distance (SSS-ID) for such classi cation and it to classically established taxonomies (genetic material ormorphological character-based organizations), demonstrating its interest. The principles and implementation as well as practical applications of such approaches will be discussed. References [1] Candolle AP de. Essai sur SN et al.

However, pharmacological studies of T. tetragonoides on anti-in flammation is barely carried out. Therefore, the present study focused on the isolation and identi cation of active materials from this plant, as well as examination for the anti-oxidant and anti-in flammatory activities of the isolated compounds.

It is consumed in itsdried form, which is called \"b\u00eache-de-mer \". Many reports described the pre- sence of (saponins) in sea cucumbers, and especiallythe Cuvierian tubules are a rich source of this type of compounds [1,2]. Theblack sea cucumber, Holothuria atra Jaeger, is one of the commercially impor- tant species in Indonesia. However, in contrast to most species of sea cucum-ber, H. atra does not possess Cuvierian tubules, but saponins were previously isolated from its body wall [3]. In this project, an extensive study of the com-position of the body wall of H. atra is carried out, with special interest in its saponin content. Black sea cucumbers were collected in East Java, Indonesia,dried, and extracted with dichloromethane and 80% methanol. Fractionationwas carried out by means of liquid partitioning and column chromatography (diaion HP20). Finally, semi-preparative HPLC-DAD-MS allowed for the cation of various saponins, according to their 1H-NMR spectra. Up till now, the structure of one compound could be fully elucidated, based on 1D and2D NMR and HRMS data. All NMR data were correspondence to the datareported by Kitagawa, for desulfated holothurin B [4]. Moreover, the HRMSdata of this compound were recorded for the rst time and con rmed the identi cation of aglycon).

Although many studies have been published examining theirmolecular structure and relative con guration by means of NMR and X-ray [2], the absolute con guration remained unresolved. We here established the absolute con guration of compounds 1-3by a combination of electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy (ECD) and vibrational circular dichroismspectroscopy (VCD).ECD spectra of 1-3 were measured and compared to spectra calculated ab initio for di erent possible stereoisomers. The most frequently repor- ted relative stereoisomer of canin ( 1) was established as (1R,2S,3R,4S,5S,6S,7S,10R)-canin. For compounds 2and 3, the ECD data reduced the number of possible con gurational isomers to four. The absolute con guration was nally established by VCD. Compound 2was (4 R,5R,6S,7S)-seco-tanapartholide, and 3as (4 S,5S,6S,7S)- seco-tanapartholide. The combination of ECD and VCD is a powerful approach for resolving the absolute con guration of conformationally fle- xible molecules. References [1] Knight DW. Activity.

To test students 'knowledge of plant chemistry we asked Finnish secondary school students (N=41) to list compounds or compound groups inplants. Majority of them could name only water and glucose. To increase stu-dent knowledge and interest in plant chemistry, we have created an inquiry taskwhere students study the anthocyanins and carotenoids of autumn leaves utili-zing both simple and more sophisticated analytical methods.Therst steps of the task include the extraction of anthocyanins and carote- noids from the leaves, and the separation of these compounds into di erent phases by liquid-liquid extractions. These steps can be performed in a regularsecondary school laboratory using student collected samples. From the sepa-rated phases, the amount of pigments are quanti ed spectrophotometrically. Finally, the anthocyanins are analyzed by a rapid and simple UPLC-MS/MSmethod to discover if the sample contains petunidin or malvidin type anthocyanidin derivatives.The task was tested with 18 secondary school students and 16 university stu-dents. Based on the feedback, students enjoyed both the extraction, which isvisually impressive because of the colorful extracts, as well as the sample col-lection. Comparing students 'results with results determined by a trained chemist showed that the student groups could carry out the analysesreliably.

Chronic in flammation is one of the factors respon- sible for in flammation-associated carcinogenesis, therefore anti- inflammation compounds could play a vital role as chemoprevention drugs [3 -5]. The aim of this work is to identify the anti-in flammatorycompounds from Xylaria sp SWUF09-62 fungus, from the Xylariaceae family, which are found in the wild throughout Thailand.The stroma of the fungus was isolated and cultivated in liquid media,then extracted with organic solvents and nally puri ed by chromatogra- phic methods.

The highest TPCs were found in the water extract of C. sappan and ethyl acetate ext- ract In adition, the water extracts of C. sappan and O. integerrima displayed potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bateria. Theantioxidant activity, TPC and antibacterial activities results were in goodagreement. These information help to considerate the use of these medi-cinal plants as natural antioxidant and antibacterial sources.

These plant-dependent mic-roorganisms have already shown their strong e ects concerning plant growth promotion and were reported to stimulate the secondary metaboli-tes (SM) production of their host-plant.In this study, Anchusa o cinalis plants, well-known for their therapeutic pro- perties, were analyzed to assess the AMF e ects on SM production. Two di e- rent experiments were developed on a semi-hydroponic system to comparetreated A. ocinalis plants with di erent AMF. In the rst investigation, plants were inoculated with Rhizophagus irregularis , cultivated for 30 days and har- vested two times. Concerning the second experiment, four di erent strains of AMF ( ) were tes- ted separately on plants and one sampling was performed after one week.Roots and shoots were separated, lyophilized, ground and extracted usingultrasounds at 25\u00b0C. After supernatants removed and evaporated to dryness. Samples wereanalyzed with UHPLC-HRMS as well as HPTLC and HPLC-DAD-ELSD.Preliminary results of a targeted metabolomic analysis, showed that the con-centration of main compound, rosmarinic acid, present in all the treatedplants had no statistically di erence from the controls. However, a discer- nable up-regulation and down-regulation of speci c minor SMs in colonized plants was observed, suggesting that the aforementioned AMF a ect speci c biosynthetic pathways. Further experiments and analyses is needed but thecultivation of medicinal plants with AMF looks a promising way to enhancebioactive metabolites with applications in pharmaceutical and cosmeceuticalindustry.

Ageing process is followed by a gradual dysfunction of the proteostasis net- work and this leads to proteome instability due to accumulation of damagedand/or misfolded proteins. The two main machineries of protein degradationin cells are the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosomepathways [1, 2].The aim of the present study was to investigate the strain CF-092983, identi-ed as Bjerkandera adusta , as a potential source of natural products able to activate proteasome and/or lysosomal cathepsins and thus to contribute tothe maintenance of protein a ected by several or endogenous factors.Chemical investigation of the EtOAc L-L extract led to the isolation of fourhydroxybenzoic acid derivatives ( Fig. 1 ). All the isolated compounds signi - cantly enhanced the activity of cathepsins B and L. Additionally, compounds1, 3 and4, promoted the main degrading activity of the 26S proteasome at a nal concentration of 5 M. Moreover, using the crystal structure of the 26S proteasome, and of cathepsins B and L we run in-silico simulations to explore the possible binding mode of the active compounds.Overall, the ndings of this study further support the antioxidant and/or the potential anti-ageing e ects of fungal extracts, and the fact that fungal natural products can be used as e ective agents for promoting human health.

Its galls havebeen used as traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of sore, cough,and hemostasis. The chemical constituents of this plant had been fastenedmainly on phenolic compounds [1, 2]. Previously, two neo flavone (4-arylcoumarines) dimers has been isolated from this plant [3]. These dimers are of interest due to the inconsistent isomers that result from the chalconeframework. Over 100 representatives of natural 4-arylcoumarins is known.The unique structure, broad popularity in traditional plant medicines contai-ning these compounds, and the valuable pharmacological properties makeneoflavones highly interesting. Herein, phytochemical investigation of the twigs of P. chinensis is indicated to explore new chemical constituents. Air-dried and pulverized aerial parts of P. chinensis (1.8 kg) were extracted with MeOH (4 \u00d7 10 L) at room temperature. After removal of the combined solvents,a crude extract (109.4 g) was obtained. The crude extract was suspended in H- 2O and partitioned with EtOAc and n-BuOH (each 3 L) in succession. The resul- ting four fractions were evaporated to dryness in vacuo, to yield EtOAc (46.5 g),n-BuOH, and H 2O extracts. The EtOAc extract was subjected to a column matography The structures of the isolated compounds were establishedon the basis of extensive analysis of NMR spectroscopic data, MS spectra analy-ses, and experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra.

The genus Biscogniauxia, which was once a member of wood-decaying fungi Xylariaceae family, has been resurrected and has become a member of newGraphostromataceae family. This fungus is naturally found on the bark,trunks, and branches of shrubs and trees [1-3]. Unlike its previous co-family,Xylaria genus, only a few reports on natural products were published from B. spp. [3-4]. The objective of this research is to investigate the chemical com-positions from Biscogniauxia sp. PK15-040 fungus collected from the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. The fungus was identi ed by its morpho- logical characteristics and molecular data. It was cultivated in PDB mediumfor 6 weeks and puri ed by chromatographic methods. Its structures were established by the interpretation of spectroscopic data including 1D and 2DNMR, and IR.Fifteen compounds were isolated and categorised eight ofcompounds, three guaiane steroids, n de r g o n e( 13);p-tyrosol ( 14) and a bergamotene derivative ( 15). The results indicate that Biscogniauxia sp. PK15-040 is an example of a marvellous source of diverse secondary metabolites and possibly diverse bioactive compounds, therefore we believe that B.spp. needs to be investigated further.

[1]. More than two-thirds of the marked chemotherapeuticagents are based on natural products [2]. However, only a few of the identi-ed anti-cancer natural product candidates entered the drug development process, hence the search for potential candidates is still essential. Xylaria , one of the wood-decaying fungi genus belonging to Xylariaceae family, hasbeen shown to be a potential source of diverse secondary metabolites, espe-cially cytotoxic compounds [3]. Thus, this research aimed to help in thissearch for new e ective anti-cancer drug candidates from this genus found in Thailand.Three selected Xylaria spp., namely X. allantoidea SWUF76; X.spp. ) compounds were isolated, respectively. Their structures were determined based on NMR, MS, ECD and X-ray data. The isolated com-pounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activities against cancer cell lines andnormal Vero cell lines MTT reasonable cytotoxicity and compounds 12and13showed slight cyto- toxicity against all tested cell lines.These results show that the selected Xylaria spp. produced diverse secondary metabolites, some of which exhibited cytotoxic activities against variouscancer cell lines.

All of them produce a variety of chemically di erent mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), compounds that are known fortheir outstanding UV absorption capacity and their photoprotective rolein nature [4]. In order to get a deeper understanding of the chemicaldiversity of MAAs in the genus, a previously developed LC-MS methodwas successfully applied for the analysis of various Bostrychia spp .T h i s approach enabled the investigation of their MAA pattern and revealeddistinct di erences among the species. Bostrychia scorpioides , for exam- ple showed a unique MAA pattern, thus leading to the isolation andidenti cation of six new MAAs. Regarding B. calliptera , earlier studies suggested the existence of either two or three genetic lineages withinthis species based on molecular DNA sequencing data [3, 5]. Phytoche-mical pro ling of those samples that were used for the DNA sequencing also revealed distinct di erences in their chemical composition. Overall, the presence or absence of brominated and sulphated compounds orvariations in their MAA pattern allowed a clear discrimination betweentherst and the other two lineages.

Among these, the main species cultivated in Brazil are:Pleurotus ostratus (shimeji), and, recently, Agaricus subrufescens (mush- room of the sun) [1, 2]. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate theantioxidant activity, the total phenolic content, and to identify the bioac-tive compounds of A. subrufescens and P. ostreatus by LC-MS/MS. The antioxidant activity of hydroalcoholic extract was evaluated by 1,1-diphe-nyl-2-picryhydrazyl radical (DPPH ) method and oxygen radical absorb- (ORAC) while the phenolic content was quanti ed by Folin-Ciocalteu method. The A. subrufescens extract presented higher antioxidant activity (54.71 \u00b1 3.45 g of the Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)100 g 1) than the P. ostreatus extract (28.99 \u00b1 0.63 g GAE 100 g1). The same results were obtained by ORAC method: A. subrufescens presented higher antioxidant activity (5.95 \u00b1 ostrea- tus(0.76 \u00b1 0.029 g GAE 100 g1).

In order to explore thepotential of endophytic fungi to produce secondary metabolites withapplications in the cosmeceutical industry, 142 diverse endophytes froma wide variety of Spanish arid plants were selected to be screened fortheir skin-whitening activity, applying the OSMAC approach. Cytotoxicityevaluation was cytotoxic fungal Nerium oleander, were selected as the most promising. Phylo- genetic analyses support that both strains could represent a new speciesofComoclathris. The aim of this study was to assess the e ect of di e- rent fermentation conditions on the tyrosinase inhibitory activity and toisolate and identify the active secondary metabolites. Tyrosinase bio-gui-ded assay of both strains led to the isolation of the main active compo-nents. Two known compounds Brevianamide M (IC 50=6 . 8 1 ), Graphostrin B (IC 50=86.32 ), and three new compounds with molecu- lar formula C 12H12O3(IC50=3.5 ), C 11H16O3(IC50=853.72 )a n d C12H10O4(IC50=0.16 )w e r ei d e n t i ed as the main responsible for the whitening activity.Volcano-plots based on LCMS were applied to determine signi cant metabolo- mic di erences between both strains and the di erent fermentation conditions tested, highlighting these bioactive secondary metabolites.

Thisdiversity occurs because of a combination of species complexity and growthenvironments. A number of research projects have investigated the e ects of fungi growth conditions on the compounds they produced including pH,temperature, and type of culture media [1,2,3]. This allowed the researchersto establish the various compounds pro les and their potential use as drug candidates. There are numerous reports on bioactive compounds from Xyla- riaspp. but only a few have concentrated on the possible impacts of culture media on the compounds [4].The aim of this research is to study the e ect of di erent culture media, namely GM and PDB, on the metabolites produced and their biological acti-vity, from the wood-decaying fungus Xylaria sp. SWUF08-81. There were six- teen compounds isolated from GM medium, ve of which were cytochalasin derivatives ( 1-5) together with three mellein, six simple monocyclic and three potential new compounds such as dibenzofuran, mellein and pyrone derivatives. From the PDB medium, nine compounds were identi ed inclu- ding two new and ve known dihydroisocoumarins derivatives ( 6-10 ) and two auroglucins. The structure elucidation of the other compounds isongoing. The preliminary bioassay screening at 100 \u00b5g/mL showed that 6, 7 and the new dibenzofuran were toxic against HCT116, HT29, MCF-7, Helaand Vero cells at a percentage of cell viability < 30 %.It can be concluded that the Xylaria sp. SWUF08-81 fungus produced entirely di erent classes of compounds when the growth culture media were altered.

P-159 Protective e ects of ethanol extract of a Mexican propolis on indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage gastric mucosa. Current treatments exhibitlimited e cacy and several side e ects, which makes it necessary to search for new alternatives[1]. One of these alternatives can be propolis.This natural product contains mainly phenols and flavonoids, which are directly related to its antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-in flammatory activities[2]. The aim of this project was to evaluate the gastroprotectiveeect of the ethanolic extract of Mexicali propolis (EeMeP) in a model of indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration in mice.Gastric lesions were induced by intragastric administration of indomethacinat a dose of 20 mg/Kg[3]. Treatment with EeMeP (100, 200 and 300 mg/Kg)was administered 2 hours before indomethacin.The results show free-radical scavenging capacity (89.92 g/mL) which is related with EeMeP presented areduction in the percentage of lesion area, attenuation of histological damage and maintenance of the mucus barrier, which can be translated as a protection of the gastric tissue compared with the group without treatment.In the group treated with EeMeP, the activity of MPO, and the levels of TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6, decreased signi cantly. In the same group, an increase in the activity of GPx and SOD was observed.We show that EeMeP has a gastroprotective e ect and that this e ect can be attributed to its flavonoid content.

The microorganismswere cultivated and extracted by optimized protocols in and a library ofmore than 1200 extracts was established. The initial screening revealedthat 0.5% of the extracts showed inhibitory activity against tyrosinaseand elastase. Subsequently, selected extracts were further evaluated fortheir ability to inhibit tyrosinase in normal diploid human dermalbroblasts. Among the most active extracts, the one from Streptomyces lopnurensis ;a n actinomycete isolated from a sea cucumber of genus Synaptula collected from Sattahip Beach (Gulf of Thailand), inhibited tyrosinase in both cell-free and cell-based assays (93.2% at 300 g/mL and 30.2% at the concentration of 10g/mL, respectively). The microorganism was re-cultivated in 10L scale, under solid and liquid con-ditions in Marine Broth, using in-situ solid phase extraction technology (XAD- 16) and it was then extracted with AcOEt and Biological activity wasconrmed ranged between 33.61-83.56% at 300 g/mL) and the most active extract was further fractionated. All fractions were puri ed by preparative techniques (HPLC, TLC), while NMR and LC-MS methodologies were implemented for the identi-cation and structure elucidation of the isolated compounds. All compounds have been further investigated for their biological activity against tyrosinasein cell-free and cell-based assays. References [1] Vlachou et al.

In result of optimization of extraction conditions the total concentration of 5analysed compounds in NDES extract was equivalent to those in 40%EtOH extract. The solubility of glycosides in NDES was higher thanthose of tyrosol, and cinnamic alco hol. This fact could be explained by polarity of solvent used. However, by variation of composition of NDESwe were able to receive extracts with increased concentration of tyro-sol, and cinnamic alcohol, while the concentration of glycosides was alittle decreased.To the best of our knowledge this is a rst report in which NDES was used for eective extraction of S.roseum.

Thus, natural products are con-sidered a valuable source for new prototypes. The hexane extract from leavesofN. oppositifolia (Lauraceae) displayed in vitro activity against Schistosoma mansoni. Based on this result, the bioactivity-guided fractionation of this ext- ract a orded the isolation of lincarin A. The in vivo antischistosomal proper- ties of licarin A were investigated for the rst time in a murine model of schistosomiasis. For in vivo experiments, three-week-old Swiss female mice were subcutaneously injected with a suspension containing 80 S. mansoni cercariae (BH strain). Licarin A was administered by oral gavage to groups ofve mice. Results showed that oral treatment with a single oral dose of licarin A achieved total worm burden reduction of 46.3% ( P<0.05). With respect to egg burdens, licarin A led to a reduction of 53.4% ( P<0.05) in the number of immature eggs, whereas analysis of fecal samples revealed a reduction of76.8% ( P<0.05) of eggs. Regarding liver and spleen pathologies, licarin A reduced the infection-promoted increase in liver mass by 19.4% and spleenmass by 22.4% in adult S. mansoni -infected mice, in comparison to vehicle treated controls. In conclusion, oral treatment with licarin A at a singledose to mice harboring chronic infection decreased the number of parasitesand eggs as well as ameliorated pathology in the liver and spleen, demonst- rating the potential of this natural compound in the treatment of schistosomiasis.

It is known to contain several bromophenols, com-pounds that are unique in the plant kingdom. Only marine organismsare able to biosynthesize them, as they have direct access to the brom-ide contained in seawater, but also by virtue of a rare enzyme calledvanadium bromoperoxidase [2]. Some of these brominated moleculesare thought to play a crucial role in the chemical protection of marineplants, but their functional role is not fully known [2].In order to obtain deeper understanding of bromophenolic compounds inred algae, seven bromophenols were isolated from the methanolic extract ofVertebrata lanosa , collected in Brittany (France), by using various chromato- graphic techniques. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucida-ted by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Among theisolated ,4,4 ,5-tetrahydroxy-6 -methoxymethyldiphenylmethane and A simultaneously developed highperformance liquid chromatography assay was used to determine the con-tent of each bromophenol in the alga and furthermore applied to screen forrespective compounds in other red algal species, too.In addition, these substances pose very interesting candidates for a pharma-cological investigation in di erent assay systems as a broad range of relevant activities of bromophenolic compounds has been reported in literature, ran-ging from antioxidant, A, Penot M.

We were looking for naturally modi ed PAs that cannot be found in plants. To develop the production methods of such rare PAs we used a unique method wherethese are modi ed by oxidation in alkaline conditions. It included the collec- tion of 300 plant samples from the Botanical Garden of the University ofTurku, Finland. From the preliminary screening, 130 plant samples have pro-cyanidin and prodelphinidin rich oligomers and polymers, which has poly-phenol oxidase enzyme activity. The PAs in these plant samples wereextracted and analyzed as such by UPLC connected to Waters XEVO TQ triplequadrupole mass spectrometer. Then the plant extracts were oxidized by anoxidation test using a pH 10 bu er. These samples were further studied by QExactive Orbitrap mass spectrometers, in order to characterize the modi ed PA structures. In addition, the proanthocyanidin oligomers and polymers inoxidized and non-oxidized samples were quanti ed by Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) methods by UPLC-MS/MS. These results suggested thatprodelphinidin (PD) rich oligomers have higher chances to modify the PAstructure in the alkaline condition whereas procyanidin (PC) rich oligomers and polymers have less chances to modify the structure. However, the PChelps to stable the tannin structure. On the other hand, if the PD is absent inthe sample then the structure is more stable, or no oxidation occurs.

Extraction optimization, structural and thermal characterization the antimicrobial wines: contribution to color and di erences in compositions between wine varieties and vintages Authors Laitila JE1, Salminen JP1 Institute 1University of Turku, Department Research Group, Vatselankatu 2, Turku, FinlandDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399910 Recently, a group-speci c UPLC -MS/MS method was published, which can separately detect three di erent types of proanthocyanidin-malvidin adducts (1-3in Fig. 1) directly from any wine sample [1]. Furthermore, the method can detect small, medium-sized and large oligomeric adducts separately, andit can detect monomeric anthocyanin adducts aswell ( 4-10in Fig. 1). Since, we have analyzed with the method a large sample set consisting of 317 unique red wines to study how the quantitative andqualitative variation in the red wine pigments explains the variation in the color intensity, and how the adduct pro les of di erent types of wine varie- ties and vintages compare to one another.With a statistical model, we could explain 85% of the variation in the colorintensity with only three compound groups ( 1, 2and7) out of the original 10 (Fig. 1). Information about the relative sizes of the oligomeric adducts 1and 2were needed to achieve the high explanatory power of the model. In the young wines, the di erences in the adduct composition between the wine varieties were found to be mostly quantitative. The evolutionary trends werepartly similar between oligomeric adducts 1-3: the average sizes of the adducts increased towards older wines in all three groups, but the quantita-tive evolution of the concentrations di ered between the groups. In conclu- sion, the group-speci c methodology enabled the precise conclusions about the basic functions and properties of the oligomeric adducts in red wines.References ngerprints of anthocyanin P-193 Natural deep eutectic solvents: an alternative for the extraction Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,Panepistimiopolis, 15771, Athens, GreeceDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399911 Plant derived natural products have an important role in pharmaceutical, cos-meceutical and food supplements industries. Their increasing demand isleading to the over-exploitation of plant resources and to the over-consump-tion of organic solvents, widely recognized to be of great environmental con-cern. For this reason, the design of green extraction methods of naturalproducts is currently a key research topic. [1-3]In order to address this issue an eco-friendly natural deep eutectic sol-vents (NADESs) were used instead of organic solvents for the extractionof naphthoquinones from the roots of Alkanna tinctoria Tausch, a Greek endemic plant from Boraginaceae than twenty NADESs con-taining choline chloride-, as hydrogen bond with di erent hydrogen bond donors (sugars, organics acids) were investigated for their potential to extract this particular class of com-pounds. As a result of the statistical evaluation, the most relevant deepeutectic mixture with the highest extraction e ciency was found to be composed of lactic acid and sucrose (LaS). To maximize the extractionyield, a further optimization step of extraction parameters was followed,including the optimum LaS ratio (w/w), the solid-to-solvent ratio, tempe-rature, water content as well as the application of solid phase extractiontechniques for the recovery of the naphtoquinone fraction from theNADES extraction solution. Our results revealed the optimized LaS mix-ture as a valid green alternative for the extraction of naphthoquinones from Alkanna tinctoria. In fact, by using a ratio (w/w), targeted compounds were successfully recovered.Fig. 1 7-Acetoxy-6 -hydroxyroyleanone (Roy) isolated from 3 3) 7: 3)R1= glucose, acetylglucose or coumaroylglucose R2= H or OH Fig. 1 The malvidin-based compound groups, which the UPLC - MS/MS method utilized in this study is able to detect.

C. lanceolata is a herbaceous perenni al plant originated in America, South Africa and Eastern Asia, reported to have antioxidant pharmacological activities of C. lanceolata , there is only one paper to isolate flavonoids in C. lanceolata flowers [1]. Therefore, the present study focused on the isolation and identi cation of active materials from the flowers of this plant, as well as evalutaion of various pharmacological activities. Seven new chalcones, two nones, two known aurones, and two known flavonols were isolated from the methanolic extract of C. lanceolata flowers. All isolated flavonoids showed radical scavenging activities in DPPH and ABTS radical experiments and inhi-bited NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Some chal-cones prevented the growth of human colon cancer cells via the induction ofcellular cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Caco-2 epithelial, and 264.7 macro-phage cells. Moreover, two aurones and two flavonols recovered the damage of the pancreatic islets caused treatment in zebra sh ) larvae. These results suggested that C. lanceolata flowers can be used as multi-metabolic diseases agents.

(Rutaceae) is an evergreen shrub only distributed in Jeju island, Korea. Traditionally, C. grandis Osbeck, which is called as \"Dangyuja \", \"Dangyuji \",o r \"Daeyuji \", has been used as a folk remedy for fever. The fruits of C. grandis were used at various ceremonies in Jeju island, Korea [1]. In recent studies, it was reported that C. grandis had two times higher organic acid con- tent than C. junos and four times more vitamin C content than lemons [2, 3]. However, there are few studies on the other chemical constituents and biologi-cal activities of C. grandis fruits. Therefore, the present study focused on the iso- lation and identi cation of active compounds from the fruits of this plant, as well as evalutaion of protective e ects of the isolated compounds on pancreatic islet damaged by alloxan in a zebra sh (Danio rerio )l a r v a em o d e l . C. grandis fruits were extracted with aqueous methanol, and the concentrared extract waspartitioned into EtOAc, n-BuOH, and H 2O fractions. The repeated normal and reverse-phase column chromatographies on EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions led to the isolation of three new isocoumarins, citragrandin A C(13), three known coumarins ( 46), known flavonoids ( 710).

In particular, yringa plants contain a large amount of iridoids that have pharmacological activities.Due to the e ectuation of the Nagoya Protocol, securing of biological resources has become very important. For this reason we have been interested in S. dila- tata, only a Korea native species of its genus. No study has been reported for components and activities of S. dilatata flower. Therefore, the present study focused on the isolation and identi cation of active compounds from this plant, as well as examination of the anti-in flammatory e ect of the isolated compounds. Dried flowers of S. dilatata were extracted with aqueous MeOH, and the con- centrated extract was partitioned into EtOAc, n-BuOH, and H 2O fractions. Repeated SiO 2, ODS, and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatographies on n- BuOH fraction, led to isolation of eight chemical struc- tures were identi ed without ambiuity. All compounds were isolated for the rst time from S. dilatata flowers in this study. Some compounds showed signi cantly NO inhibition in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In quantitative analysis of iridoids in the S. dila- tataflowers was conducted through HPLC experiments. These results suppor- ted that the iridoids isolated from the S. dilatata flowers and its extract are potential as anti-in flammatory agents.

However, isolation of natu-ral products has always been tedious, as herbal extracts are complicated sys-tems, containing hundreds of chemical entities. It is time and solventconsuming and very often the procedure ends with the re-isolation of knownmetabolites. Complementary, there has been a pressing need to involveapproaches that accelerate the measurement of metabolite levels directlyfrom plant extracts through the implementation of HTS technologies and chemometrics. The goal of PEGASUS is the establishment of a validated analytical chemo-metrics platform through the elaboration of contemporary chromatographicand spectroscopic techniques (FCPC, HPTLC, LC-HRMS/MS, NMR) along and e ective identi cation of bioactive compounds, prior to their isolation.The last ve years, the development of an HeteroCovariance Approach ( HetCa algorithms), has been applied at our department for the discovery of bioac-tive metabolites for several biological targets such as free radicals, enzymesand cancer cell lines [1-4]. HetCa is a MATLAB toolbox based on Statistical Total Spectroscopy (STOCSY) and Statistical Heterospectroscopy(SHY) methodologies.

These compounds have poor bio-availability, in vivo they undergo a rapid metabolism, and bioreduced derivati- ves are among their main in vivo metabolites. These metabolites were also reported to exert various bioactivities in vitro and in vivo [2]. They can be syn- thetized by batch hydrogenation, however this method has low selectivity [3].Our objective was to develop a procedure to selectively obtain curcuminoidswith di erent levels of saturation by using a continuous flow hydrogenation reactor. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate pharmacokinetic properties ofthe prepared metabolites, such as kinetic solubility, chemical achieved high selectivity in preparing hexahydrocurcumin.The pharmacokinetic tests showed that the reduced metabolites have dra-matically increased water solubility and chemical stability as compared tothat of curcumin. The metabolic rate by hexahydrocurcumin octahydrocur- BBB and GI penetration, similarlyto hexahydrocurcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin was however largely superior in this regard.

This standardised extract contains 17 to20 % oligomeric B-type procyanidins (OPCs), which are its bene cial cardio- and vasoprotective e ects. However, it is known that higher oligomers do not reach the blood circulationas such, but are metabolised to smaller entities by intestinal bacteria.Therefore, we have investigated whether procyanidin monomers, like epica- techin or further degraded substances, like -valerolactone do reach target tissue and examined their pharmacokinetics.For the quanti cation of both metabolites, rats were treated twice daily with 300 mg/kg WS \u00ae1442 for three consecutive days. Plasma and several tissues (heart, liver, kidney and aorta) were collected at 8 di erent time points (t = 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 24 h) after the last treatment. All samples werehomogenised in a suitable bu er, phase II conjugates were hydrolysed enzy- matically and the aglycons were extracted with ethyl acetate. After removalof the organic solvent, the residue was taken up and, submitted to HPLC-MS/MS analysis.Epicatechin and -valerolactone were detectable in plasma and all examined tissues and showed distinct concentration-time pro les. Particularly interesting is the quite high concentration of epicatechin inaortic vessels (227.1 \u00b1 123.2 ng/g), even higher than in plasma (159.8 \u00b193.7 ng/mL), which may in consequence give evidence vasoprotec-tive e ects of WS \u00ae1442.

This family comprises about 5000 species de ned in about 70 genera. These species are widely distributed throughout th e world and are found growing in low to high land. The genus Carex consists of approximately 1500 species distri- buted throughout the world. Previously, many chemical constituents havebeen isolated from the family kobomugi, a perennial plant, widely grows in the coastal zones in Japan. Some stilbene oligomershave been reported from this plant root. These oligomers are of interestdue to the inconsistent isomers that res ult from the resveratrol framework. While C. kobomugi have been shown to possess several interesting metabo- lites, no reports have yet been published that describe the chemical consti-tuents found in flowers.

(Vitaceae family) is a popular woody perennial plant commonly used in the winemaking. Unfortunately, viticulture generates huge amounts ofresidues (i.e. leaves, twigs, seeds, skins), which can cause environmental issueswhen discarded in open areas. It is there fore extremely imp ortant to evaluate the potential reuse of these matrices, to reduce the amount of waste at land ll sites [1,2]. Among the main grapevine by-products, no data on the green pru-ning residues (GPRs) produced by the a nnual spring pruning have been repor- ted. Thus, the aim of this work was the analysis and valorization of GPRs from16 red and white V. vinifera cultivars from Piedmont (Italy), by comparing the results with those obtained from the leaves of the same cultivars. An experimen-tal design optimization was performed and the obtained hydroalcoholic extractswhere then quali- and quantitatively analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS/MS, with similarpolyphenolic pro les for both GPRs and leaves. 3- O-glucuronide, caf- taric acid and quercetin 3- O-glucoside were the main components of the investi- gated matrices, although in variable proportions. Considering the prevalentpresence of polyphenols in the analyzed ex tracts their antioxidant activity was evaluated with colorimetric in-vitro assays, o -line combined with HPLC-PDA analysis. In this way the contribution of each compound to the antioxidant acti-vity, in terms of radical scavenging abilities, was determined.These ndings could suggest GPRs as a potential source of natural compounds, and therefore promote their use in the food eld, as food supplements, which could increase their economic value together with a positive e ect on the environment.

P-213 SL YRW-01 Abstract see on page 1395 P-214 Protein precipitation activity of re Research Group, Vatselankatu 2, 20014, Turku which consist offlavan-3-ol type subunits. PAs possess a variety of bioactivities such as anthelmintic activity against ruminant gastrointestinal nematodes [1,2]. PAs are found in multiple legume species and thereby they couldform a solution to the global problem of ruminant gastrointestinalnematodes [3]. In biological activity studies, PAs have been usually utili-zed either as plant material or crude extracts and fractions. Usually PAcomposition of a single plant species can be extremely complicated con-sisting of even hundreds of compounds with di erent flavan-3-ol combi- nations. Thus, the structural complexity of PAs makes the structure - bioactivity linkage examinations challenging.The aim of this study was to utilize chromatographically re ned PA fractions produced from 11 Finnish plant species [4] to study their protein precipita-tion capacity (PPC) -the most probable mode of action of PAs against nematodes -via novel well plate reader method. The fractionation is illust- rated in Fig 1 .T h er e ned fractions were analysed for their subunit con- tent, polymer size and galloylation by UPLC-MS/MS [5]. The novel well-platereader method was a turbidimetry based measurement of the insolublecomplex formed during the PA -protein interaction. This approach revealed how the PPC of a complex PA mixture is divided in di erent retention time areas and how the PA subunit content, polymer size and galloylation a ect the PPC.

P-215 Qualitative and quantitative determination of flavonoids in di erent organs of Atriplex nitens Schkuhr Medyczna, 30-688, Cracow Poland; 2Department of Pharmaceutical A. sagittata is a com- mon weed resistant to harsh environmental conditions, such as salinity ordrought. The plant is also valued as fodder due to high biomass production. Itsphytochemical composition is poorly known, except for the presence of prot-eins, fats and ecdysteroids in seeds [1, 2]. Related species are reported to havehigh anti-oxidant properties and are rich sources of phenolics, including flavo- noids. These were detected eg. A. lentiformis, or A. littoralis [3]. Flavonoids are known for various biological activities that determine their medi-cinal use. One of these is anti-hyaluronidase activity [4]. Therefore, the aim ofour study was qualitative and quantitative determination of flavonoids in crude extracts from di erent organs of A. nitens , together with estimation of their eect on this enzyme. Flavonoids have been analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. They were detected only inthe aboveground parts of the plant. Nine compounds were quanti ed. Among them, kaempferol-3-glucoside-7-rhamnoside was predominant (259.33 \u00b1 6.11 \u00b5g/ mg). The highest anti-hyaluronidase activity in vitro, determined by turbidi- metric method [5], was observed for the flower extract (IC 50= 84.67 \u00b5g/mL). This corresponds to the high amount of total flavonoids in this plant part (624.09 \u00b5g/mg), including the predominant isoquercetin. References [1] Rabbimov A, Bekchanov B, and Mukimov T.

Due to the increased scienti ci n t e - rest of these compounds, large amounts of pure metabolites are urgentlyneeded. In the present study, a separation method based on CentrifugalPartition Extractor (CPE) was developed, resulting in rapid and e ective isolation of oleanolic and maslinic acid in pure form. The preliminarystudy of our group revealed that the unpolar extract of olive leaves(OLUE) contains an important amount of OA while total phenolic fraction(TPF) obtained from the liquid-liquid extraction of EVOO is a good sourceof MA. Both OLUE and TPF extracts have been the biphasic system n-hexane-ethylacetate-ethanol-water 3:2:3:2 (v/v/v/v). The analysis was run in ascending mode andlasted 40 min for both extracts resulting in the fast recovery of the enri-ched fractions. The second step of the process included the treatment ofthe enriched fractions using pH-zone re ning CPE method. The biphasic system consisted of n-hexane-ethylacetate-ethanol-water 8:2:5:5 (v/v/v/v)while TFA and TEA were added in the stationary and mobile phase res-pectively. Following this two-st ep procedure, 640 mg of OA and 550mg of MA were recovered with greater than 95% purity, as determined by Fig. 1 Planta Medica 2019; 85: 1386 -1390 1501 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

T. crispa and T. baenzigeri are well known in Thailand and used as herbal remedy, particularly T. crispa . By contrast, T. baenzigeri has not been extensi- vely studied. Previous investigations of the plant resulted in the isolation andcharacterization of a number of rearranged clerodane furanoditerpenoidsand their glucosides. Their claimed antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum could not be con rmed, and other biological activities have not been examined yet. In order to discover natural compounds with diversestructure and biological activity from Thai medicinal plants and to extend thestudy on T. baenzigeri , the plant specimens were examined for their phyto- chemical constituents. Four new rearranged clerodane-type diterpenoids ( 1 4), a new glucoside ( 5), and six known compounds ( 611) were obtained from the EtOAc crude extract of T. baenzigeri stem. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by interpreting their spectroscopic data, particu-larly 1D analysis was subse- quently performed to con rm the structures and relative con gurations of compounds 14. These compounds are rare examples of rearranged cleroda- nes, particularly compound 4possessing a fully oxidized tetrahydrofuranyl ring.

However, prolonged in flammation might lead to tissue destruction, organ dysfunction, or even death. Continuous in flammation may cause chronic human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer 's disease, and so on. There are many side e ects on current medication of in flammation, which limit the use of anti-in flammatory drugs. Therefore developing new anti-in flammatory drugs is an urgent issue. Approximately sixty indigenous Formosan Laura-ceous plants have been screened for anti-in flammatory activity. Among them, the methanolic extract of Machilus zuihoensis Hayata sho- wed potent anti-in flammatory e ect.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The methanolic extract of the root of M. zuihoensis was partitioned into the ethyl acetate layer and water layer. Bioassay-guided fractionation ofthe active ethyl acetate layer of the root of M. zuihoensis led to the isola- tion of three new compounds, including one new butanolide, machizui-honol ( 1), two new lignans, machilolinol ( 2) and marphenol L ( 3), together with nineteen known compounds, including four benzenoids, two butanoli-des, one coumarin, one flavonoid, six lignans, three sesquiterpenoids and two steroids. The structures of these compounds were elucidated byspectral analysis.

Zanthoxylum species, frequently used in Asian cuisine e.g. Sichuan pepper for their tingling sensation [3], have been well documen-ted to be a rich source of alkamides. Zanthoxylum rhetsa (Roxb.) DC., Rutaceae, originating in subtropical regions, a typical spice and \"the soul \" of Northern Vietnamese culinary art, is traditionally employed for treat- ment of in flammatory-related ailments especially toothache [4]. The tar- get of this study was to investigate the alkamide compositions of thisspice. From the dichloromethane fraction of the Z. rhetsa fruit extract, fourteen alkamides could be isolated. Two compounds, rhetsamide A andrhetsamide B, were identi ed as C12 fatty acid isobutylhydroxyamides. remaining twelve compounds which comprise hydroxy- -isosanshool, the major of investigated extract, were determined as C14 fatty acid isobutylhydroxya-mides. To our knowledge, none of these compounds except for hydroxy--isosanshool was previously described for this species and this is the rst report of the ten new compounds, rhetsamide A-J. These results revealedthat the fruits of this plant are a valuable source of new natural productsas well as promising biological principles, which are worthy to be furtherinvestigated and exploited.

The scienti c literature contains plenary of phytochemi- cal and biological works regarding its fruits, leaves and olive oil in contrast toolive flowers were only few data are available. The main goal of the current work was to elaborate a phytochemical study of olive flowers for the isolation and identi cation of their major secondary metabolites. The analysis was contacted in hydroalkoholic extract and was achieved in twosteps. Initially the extract was fractionated by step-gradient CPC and subse-quently the chosen fractions were further puri ed using preparative HPLC. The result of our study was the isolation of nine natural compounds, two ofwhich are flavonoids (rutin, quercetin-3-O-sophoroside), two triterpenic -hydroxy-oleuropein, 2 -ethoxy-oleuropein, elenolic acid rutinoside and oleofloside). It is important to say that the compounds 2 -ethoxy-oleuropein (1), elenolic acid rutinoside (2) and oleo floside (3) are described for the rst time and thus are considered new natural products.The structural elucidation of isolated compounds was con rmed by NMR and HRMS/MS spectroscopy. In parallel, the hydroalcoholic extract andthe isolated secoiridoid derivatives were evaluated for their ability toinhibit tyrosinase, elastase and collagenase activity. The results showedthat both extract and the isolated compounds exhibit remarkable biolo- gical activity in inhibiting the collagenase enzyme with 2 -ethyloxy-oleu- ropein and 2 -hydroxy-oleuropein being the most active. In contrast, there was no activity observed, as far as the inhibition of the enzymestyrosinase and elastase.

They occur as oligomeric and polymeri c PACs, depending on the degree of polymerisation (DP). Whereas analytical methodology for PACs with lowDP is well established, analysis of higher oligomers and polymers is still challenging, since structural diversi ty of the polymer strands is increas- ing with higher DP. Typical modi cations are related to building blocks with di erent hydroxylation pattern or t o additional substitution e.g., galloylation. Furthermore, two types of inter flavan linkages - B-type (46o r48) or A-type (4 8/27) - are possible [1]. In this study, Kendrick Mass Defect (KMD), which is a common methodology to cha-racterize hydrocarbon polymers in petrochemistry since the 1980 's, is transferred to PACs, based on LC-(+)ESI-qTOF-MS data obtained fromextracts of model herbal predominant flavan-3-ol unit in PACs, serves as a reference unit, instead of commonly used CH 2- blocks.

Koch has a longstanding history as herbal remedy in the Alpine region of Austria, where the rhizomes (= Radix Impera-toriae) are traditionally used to treat disorders of the gastro-intestinal andrespiratory tract as well as the cardiovascular system [1]. A recentethnopharmacological study on 71 Austrian traditional herbal drugs revea- led a distinct anti-in flammatory activity by Radix Imperatoriae [2]. In the present work, the aim was to unravel the constituents responsible for theobserved anti-in flammatory activity of a dichloromethane-methanol extract prior to isolation. Therefore, a recently developed biochemometricapproach named ELINA (Eliciting Nature 's Activities) [3] was applied. Here, the objective was to simplify the crude extract by generating micro-frac-tions with quantitative variances of constituents over several consecutivefractions. This was achieved via an optimized high-performance counter-current chromatographic (HPCCC) fractionation. After this single fractiona-tion step, data and bioactivity data from an in vitro assay on the cell adhesion molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1 were collected for all 31micro-fractions. In parallel to a quantitative variance of 1H-NMR signals over consecutive fractions, bioactivity patterns relating to this variation wereobtained. To reveal chemical features crucial for the observed activities, sta-tistical heterocovariance analyses (HetCA) [4] were performed. In addition,LC-MS-CAD data were used to facilitate the identi cation of the bioactive constituents. As a result, we identi ed two coumarins (Imperatorin and Ost- the anti-in flammatory activities.

These resultshighlight the advantage of extracts with a composition close to that ofthe plant totum (i.e. all the active compounds of the plant) compared to a single compound since mice supplemented with the HRE presented adecrease in stress reactivity in an acute mild stress situation which couldbe associated to a better resilience to stress. P-233 A new semi-synthetic sapogenol derivative Technology, 35430, Urla, Izmir, Turkey; 10.1055/s-0039-3399943 Since saponin 's antitumor researchers focus on their semi-synthetic modi cation to obtain structures with higherpotencies. With the same motivation, we prepared a cytotoxic sapogenol derivative (AG-08) from cycloastragenol. Our preliminary studies revealedthat AG-08 induced primarily necrotic cell death along with autophagicinhibition. Furthermore, immunoblotting experiments demonstrated thatAG-08 promoted cleavage of various proteins such as ATGs, p62, andPARP-1.The main goals of this study were to verify anti-cancer potential of AG-08and investigate its possible mechanism(s). Firstly, cytotoxicity of AG-08 on 13human cell lines was examined and IC 50values were found to be between 2.3 \u00b10.035 to 10.18\u00b10.509 \u00b5M with no selectivity towards cancer and normalcells. Since AG-08 induced cleavage of various proteins, we investigated theeect of several protease inhibitors on the cell death. Inhibitors of calpain-1, general caspases, cathepsin B/L/S, and caspase 8 partially alleviated celldeath with 1.52, 1.55, 1.38 and 1.24-fold, respectively, whereas cathepsin D/E inhibitors did not cause any signi cant change. Our results from autophagy and lysosomal proteases studies prompted us to evaluate the integrity oflysosomes in live cells. Our lysotracker staining data suggested that AG-08may be an inducer of membrane permeabilization. In conclusion,AG-08 is a agent possessing necrotic cell death and autop-hagy inhibitory properties. Further studies are in progress to clarify complete mechanism of AG-08. Acknowledgement This study was supported by T\u00dcB TAK (Project Number: 118S709). P-234 The ripening stage C.A. Meyer) berry in fluences its their bioavailability Authors Jin S1, Eom SH1, Hyun TK1 Institute Department of Industrial Plant Science and Technology, College of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, Chungbuk National University,28644, Cheongju Republic of KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399944 Ginseng root is the most popular medicinal herb in the world, whereasthe berry has been considered a useless by-product. However, the pre-sence of large amounts of bioactive compounds such as saponins and flavonoids in ginseng (Panax ginseng) berry suggests its potential as a functional resource for the food and medical industries. In this study, weevaluated the pharmaceutical value of ginseng berry by analyzing itsantioxidant activity and anti-melanogenic e ects and analyzed the varia- tion in bioactivities of ginseng berry during the ripening process. As aresult, the highest level of antioxidant and anti-melanogenic activitieswas observed in fully ripe berry extracts (Go-S3). Phytochemical scree-ning showed that antioxidant and whitening activities mediated by poly-phenolic compounds such as delphinidin-3-glucoside (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 to 541.8\u00b15 . 4 g/g (0.5 \u00b1 0.2 to 462.8 \u00b1 11.7 g/g of extract) increased during the ripening process. Further- more, results obtained by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, tyro-sinase inhibition assay and molecular docking analysis suggested thatGo-S3 probably inhibits tyrosinase activity by interacting with copper-coordinating histidines and second shell residues of tyrosinase, resultingin the reduction of melanin production in -MSH-stimulated B16F10 cells. Taken together, these nding suggest the potential of ginseng berry as a resource for functional applications in the phytocosmeticindustries and demonstrate that fruit ripening stages will be useful forfurther studies on ginseng berry for its Medica 2019; 85: 1386 -1390 1507 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

P-235 Activity of three South African plants on phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi of tomatoes andchemical pro ling of the extracts Authors Makhubu FN1, McGaw LJ1 Institute 1Phytomedicine Programme, Private Bag X04, 0110, the fungal and bacterial kingdom cause destructionof large elds of agricultural crops, with great economic loss worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate three South African plant extracts foractivity against phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi and to pro le their chemi- cal constituents. A serial microplate dilution method was used to determinethe minimum inhibitory of Leonotis leonurus, Clausena anisata and Lantana . Gas was used for pro ling the phytochemicals from the acetone and dichloro- methane/methanol extracts. L. leonurus and L. rugosa extracts had mode- rate to weak activity with MIC values ranging between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/mL.L. rugosa fractions were more active with MIC values ranging between 0.078 to 0.156 mg/mL against most phytopathogenic bacteria, followed bydichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions of L. leonurus. All extracts and fractions were inactive against Fusarium spp. except the water extract of L. leonurus with MIC of 0.156 mg/mL. The selectivity index indicated that L. rugosa was unsafe. The GC-MS analysis of L. leonurus dichloromethane/ methanol extract revealed a high quantity (32%) of 9,12-octadecadienoylchloride, (Z,Z)-. This was followed by 9-octadecenamide, (Z)- with 20%, andthis compound is known to have antibacterial activity. This study supportsfurther investigation of L. leonurus for management of pest diseases of tomatoes.

The CQ harvesting time is highly varied from 6months to 3 years and no study has ind icated the cultivating factors that a ect quality. Therefore, we study the activity-related chemical proles of CQ stems during age change. CQ was cultivated separately in six rows in the same area in Prachinburi province, Thailand. Thenew-growth stems were labelled every month until 18 months oldbefore collecting separately. TLC ngerprints \u2014were established with two-mobile phase systems. The stem chemical pro les showed di erences betweenyoung shoots (<3 months), mature (4 -15 months) and old woody stems (16 -18 months); moreover, di erences between the stems, lea- ves and in flo r e s c e n c ew e r eo b s e r v e d .T h eC Qe x t r a c t ss t i m u l a t e da c t i v i - ties on osteoblast di erentiation in vitro [3] and the activity-chemical prole relation was analyzed by multivariate analysis.

[1]Several in vitro experiments are reported to identify AGEs inhibitors, for ins- tance: measuring glycation of bovine serum albumin, determination of fruc-tosamine adducts and measuring -dicarbonyl compounds. [2] However, the latter methods su er from various drawbacks like a complex formation bet- ween test products and the protein can result in quenching of the fluores- cence signal and misinterpretation of the data. Therefore, it was of utmost importance to develop and validate a reliable and universal method to cir-cumvent these problems. Subsequently, several classes of natural productswill be tested in the new method for their AGEs inhibition properties.In this research, the precise quanti cation of N(6)-carboxymethyllysine (CML), one of the most abundant AGEs [3], was achieved through HILIC Ultra-Perfor-mance Liquid Chromatography Xevo G2-XS system,using d 2-CML as an was generated by incubation of GK- peptide and ribose. The sample preparation included a hydrolysis step withhydrochloric acid and a clean up step with P3 (Protein Precipitation Plate) cart-ridges. The method was validated following the FDA guidelines of BioanalyticalMethod Validation [4] regarding linearity, LLOQ, precision and quality controls.Overall, advanced glycation is a leading cause for the progression and patho-genesis of many chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus). Speci cally, this validated method can contribute to the unambiguous discovery of newpotential anti-AGEs agents. References [1] Rahbar S, Figarola of advanced A 135 -161 [2] Hodge J.

P-240 An integrated strategy to characterize new anti-in flammatory lead compounds derived 1Natural products & Food Research and Analysis (NatuRA), Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Antwerp,Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Antwerp, BelgiumDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3399948 Since many NSAID show severe gastrointestinal side e ects, there is a high need for new drugs. [1] An integrated strategy, based on natural pro-drugsand their metabolites, is developed to characterize new anti-in flammatory lead compounds derived from Filipendula ulmaria . Firstly, the phytochemical composition was explored in a comprehensivemanner using UPLC-DAD-HRMS. Next to salicylates like salicylic acid, anactive in vivo metabolite, a rich diversity of phenolic constituents was identi ed. [2,3] Extensive biotransformation after oral intake can be expected. This urgesthe need for identi cation and activity pro ling of the intestinal and hepatic metabolites. Therefore, an in vitro gastrointestinal biotransformation model (GIBM) was used, which mimics the gastric, intestinal and colonic phase,including fecal fermentation. [4] These metabolites hydrolysis was wasfurther biotransformed to salicylic acid by the S9 fraction.As a last step, biotransformed samples will be evaluated with in vitro anti-in flammatory assays, focusing on cyclooxygenase (COX). extract of F. ulmaria (20 \u00b5g/mL) was tested in a cell- based COX-2 gene expression assay. No inhibition was observed. Howe-ver, the same extract (50 \u00b5g/mL) showed an inhibition \u00b1 on the COX-2 enzyme.The combination of these analytical and in vitro methods, results in an innovative concept to identify and further develop new leads for drugs.

The experiments aimed to identifypotential antiadhesive compounds from celery extract to provide strategiesfor improved standardization of the herbal material. Decoction, hydroalcoho-lic and acetone extracts were prepared from celery fruits. Bioassay-guidedfractionation was performed by Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatographyand preparative HPLC, followed by LC-MS and NMR investigations. The anti- adhesive activity of extracts, fractions and puri ed compounds was assessed byflow cytometry, as positivecontrol. In fluence of the extract on gene expression of selected adhesins and tness genes was monitored by qPCR. Concentration-dependent antiadhesive activity was found for the hydroalcoholic and even more for the acetone ext-ract AE (IC 5085g/mL). Bioassay-guided fractionation senkyunolide (inactive) and sedanenolide (IC 50790M), which is assessed as the main antiadhesive compound, and accounts for 4.0%in the water extract, for 18% in the hydroethanolic extract and for 71% in AE.Additionally, a similar phthalide, Z-ligustilide, was shown to exert an IC 50of 611M. Furthermore, AE caused a signi cant upregulation of free floating, non-attached UPEC and signi cantly down-regulated these genes in adherent bacteria. Summarizing, phthalides were identi ed as the main active compounds in polar and semi-polar extracts, which exert strongantiadhesive activity against UPEC and support the traditional use inphytotherapy.

Contributing to this is thereduced survival rate (< 5%) of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer anddrug resistance in malaria which threatens to further exacerbate the alreadyworrisome situation. These emphasize the need to develop new drugs tocombat these diseases. Inspired by the fact that natural products have served as a source of unique privileged chemical sca olds, we have screened a small library of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids isolated from Ancistrocladus species from the D.R. Congo for their antiausterity activity against human PANC-1pancreatic cancer cells and antiplasmodial activity against both intra-erythro-cytic asexual and sexual Plasmodium parasites. The compounds showed moderate to strong antiausterity activities at a concentration-dependentmanner with their PC 50values ranging from 7.6 to 67.8 M. New compoundsancistroyafungines B and D were the most potent representatives within this series[1]. Eleven out of 30 compounds investigated for their antiplasmodial activity showed good growth-inhibitory e ects (IC 50< 1 \u00b5M) against both drug sensitive and resistant intra-erythrocytic asexual P. falciparum parasite strains with most promising minimal (10 > R.I. >1) to no cross resistance (R.I.< 1) to chloroquine with selectivity indices of > 10. Jozimine A 2was the most potent agent against P. falciparum gametocyte stages and in blocking ex fla- gellation of microgametes. Our study provides encouraging data for the con-tinued interrogation of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids in search of noveldrugs for the treatment of both cancer and malaria.

Due to their typical physico-chemical properties,the potential of volatile antimicrobials lies especially in the inhalationtherapies for treatment of respiratory infections. Although there weresome attempts to determine the antimicrobial e ect of certain classes of plant-derived [2] in liquid phase, the e ect in volatile phase is still not well understood.In this study, the growth-inhibitory e ect of certain representatives of p-menthanes was tested using broth microdilution volatilisationmethod in liquid and vapour phase [3] against standard strains of bac-terial pathogens causing respiratory infections such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae ,a n d a result, thymoquinone produced the strongest antibacterial activity againstall strains tested with MICs ranging from 2 to 32 g/mL in liquid phase and from 4 to 64 g/mL vapour phase. Thymol and carvacrol have an antimicrobial activity varying in ranges of 64 to 256 g/mL both in vapour and liquid phase. 1,8-cineol and p-cymene have no relevant antimicrobial activity neither inliquid, nor vapour phase. The results suggest that quinone structure contributesignicantly to the antibacterial action of p-menthanes in vapour phase. In addition, presence of hydroxyl group on the p-cymene skeleton increases itsantibacterial action. In comparison to previous experiments, this study wasperformed with broader spectrum of bacteria and the activity of tested com-pounds was compared with other groups of monoterpenes (e.g. pinanes).

Three wood vinegars from each plant including Tamarindus indica, Mangi- fera indica and Azadirachta indica was evaluated for the antibacterial activities using agar disc di usion and broth microdilution methods and the mode of action of each wood vinegar determined by scanning electron microscope.Three wood vinegars showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity againstboth gram-positive pathogenic The minimuminhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values weresimilar with ranging from 1.25-6.25 %v/v. The electron micrographs of cellstreated with each wood vinegar showed the similar activity by the disruptionof cell membrane in both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacte-ria. Microstructural observations showed that wood vinegars depleted of thecontent of bacterial cells, indicating that the cell structures of treated bacteriawere severely a ected and damaged by the antibacterial agents. The treated cells showed an incomplete and deformed shape of the cells when comparedwith the untreated cells. A pH value in culture condition may a ect the confor- mation of the bacterial cell driven by the ATPase energy-consuming pump inbacterial cell membrane [1,2,3]. Moreover, wood vinegar exhibited a pH in aci- dic value. Wood vinegar may target on a bacterial cell membrane.

It is associated with a reduction of acetylcholine levels. Thus, it is interesting to nd drugs that inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholines-terase (BChE) [ 1]. Asian bamboos are reported to improve spatial memory capa- city and to reduce AChE activity [2]. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the anticholinesterase potential of Merostachys neesii Rupr., an endemic Brazilian woody bamboo. Leaves and culms of M. neesii (n=3) were collected during the dry (August/2016) and rainy (February/2017) seasons. Plant material was sub-mitted to two extraction processes: serial maceration using hexane and 70%ethanol; and infusion. AChE and BChE inhibitory activity was evaluated by Ell-man 's colorimetric method using a microplate reader. Results were expressed as minimal inhibitory concentration to reach 50% inhibition (MIC 50). MIC 50values were compared by the t-test or Wilcoxon test for two samples (non-parametric data) using R software to verify if there was a signi cant di erence ( p0.05) cau- sed (HE-L: 376.92 \u00b1 48.14 g mL-1)a n dc u l m s( H E - C :5 9 2 . 2 4\u00b11 6 4 . 1 4 gm L-1) from the rainy season showed the lowest MIC 50, but still higher than that of neostigmine (33.84 ng mL-1). AChE inhibition has also been reported for M. magellanica [3]. Also, HE-L showed as i g n i cant di erence between the seasons, with lower MIC 50value in the rainy season ( Fig. 1 ). No inhibition of BChE was observed. In conclusion, seasonality influenced the AChE inhibitory activity of HE-L; however, no extract showed pro- mising anticholinesterase activity.

Oxidative stress Tumor necrosis (TNF- ) levels were evaluated by ELISA assay.Aloe barbadensis inhibited ROS production both during oxidative stress and in inflammatory conditions as well as COX-2 and iNOS expression, at all tested concentrations, during in flammation in IEC-6. In the same experimental con- ditions, Aloe barbadensis also increased the cytoprotective enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 expression and reduced TNF- release. The treatment of IEC-6 Aloe barbadensis plus Punica granatum (9:1 ratio) signi cantly increases the activity of Aloe barbadensis alone. Our results indicate that Aloe barbadensis and Punica granatum combination could be useful to reduce the oxidative stress and in flammatory-mediated complications, also associated to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, at intesti-nal level.

We pre-viously searched for natural products with antipruritic activity using in vivo assay systems, through evaluation of the inhibitory e ect on scratching beha- vior induced by compound 48/80 (COM, a mast cell degranulation agent) in amouse model of chronic itch, which was developed originally to investigateblood stasis and stress. The result of our search revealed the antipruritic acti-vity of the fresh aerial part of Oxalis corniculate (FAOC). Dried whole plants of O. corniculata have been used in Chinese herbal medicine for their e ects on pyresis, urticaria and sedation. Several flavonoid derivatives have been isola- ted from the whole plants, but their antipruritic activity is unknown.Aim: To determine the antipruritic e ects of the FAOC and it 's active compounds.Methods: The activity were measured as previously described. The extracts(100 mg/kg) were administered p.o.1hr before injection of COM. The struc- tures of compounds were identi ed with authentic samples by comparing the LC-MS data.Results: A MeOH extract of the compounds and the identi cation of other active com- pounds are presently under investigation.Conclution: Our ndings showed that the FAOC may provide new leads for the discovery of antipruritic substances for the treatment of the itching sen-sation that accompanies allergic reactions.

This bacteria has a harmful potential to cause a varietyof community and hospital-acquired infections. Over the years, S. aureus strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics have been reported,which complicates the staphylococcal infections 'treatment [1]. Various plant-derived products, such as Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil, are used for elimination of S. aureus in clinical practice [2]. Therefore, plant compounds and their mixtures (e.g. extracts) are still perspective mate-rials for the development of new anti-staphylococcal agents. Since theantimicrobial properties of some Myristica sp. have already been repor- ted [3], we decided to evaluate growth-inhibitory e ects of seed and aril hexane extracts from plant A.Gray and Myristica inutilis Rich ex A.Gray, against twelve S. aureus strains including antibiotic-resistant forms using the broth micro- dilution method [4].In this study, all plant extracts tested showed a certain degree of anti-staphy-lococcal e ect with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 8 to 1,024 \u00b5g/mL. The aril extract of M. hypargyraea possessed the highest antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 33591 and three clinical isolates with a MIC value of 8 \u00b5g/mL.Our results suggest potent antimicrobial properties of seed and aril ext-racts from M. hypargyraea and M. inutilis that could be used by the phar- maceutical industry for the treatment of skin and respiratory infectionscaused by S. aureus . However, further research focused on chemical ana- lysis, cytotoxic e ects and in vivo evaluation is to be car- ried out.Kuwanon U ( 2) Albanol B -1590 1515 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

The bactericidal activity of its total oil (extracted byhexane) was compared to its essential oil (MEO, 5% v/v) using viable count tech-nique against Staphylococcus aureus 6538) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa ATCC 9027). MEO exhibited a better activity with >99.999% killing of both tested strains after 2h contact time. MEO (5% v/v) wastested using the same technique against four multidrug resistant isolates; S. aureus (MRSA, sputum), Escherichia coli (E. coli , urine), Ps. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia , sputum). Highest bactericidal activity was observed against Ps. aeruginosa and least activity was against K. pneumonia (99.59 and 54.04% killing, respectively after 2h contact time). A cream andmouthwash were formulated using 5% v/v MEO. The cream showed a betteractivity against Ps. aeruginosa than S. aureus (86.68 and 51.11 % killing, respec- tively after 2h contact time). A 75% reduction in oral aerobic bacteria wasobserved after gargling the mouthwash for 2 min. This reduction was sustainedfor 20-30 min. followed by slow gradual increase in the number of recoveredbacteria. GC/MS analysis allowed the identi cation of 17 and 9 compounds representing 92.01 and 97.99% of the total and essential oil, respectively.Furano-eudesma-1,3-diene (15.99%) and 2-acetoxy-furano-diene (26.82%)were the major identi ed compounds in the total and essential oil, respectively. These results indicate that Myrrh essential oil is a promising antibacterial agentthat can be formulated against multidrug resistant bacterial strains.

This has led to an increased research interest in Tyr inhi- bitors during the last decades, often pointing to polyphenols as active compounds with polyphenols occurring particularly frequent. However, inthe early stages of drug discovery, it is nowadays common practice to avoidthe high costs of human tyrosinase by using the more economic mushroomtyrosinase (mh-Tyr). Since some polyphenols are accepted as substrates bymh-Tyr, the present study aims to investigate this enzyme 's substrate speci - city towards common polyphenols, and to discuss its signi cance in the con- text of bioactivity-guided fractionation.A dataset of 56 natural products was assembled and classi ed into assay interferers and non-interferers, using spectrophotometric and LC-ESI-HRMSassays. Based on these experimental ndings, SARs de ning for AIs were deduced and implemented into an in silico tool that will allow for rapid presc- reening in the future.Polyphenols that ful ll speci c structural criteria are converted by mh-Tyr to the respective o-quinones, which are likely to form further oxidation productswith di erent absorption maxima. Mh-Tyr substrates can thus change the sample color during an inhibition assay, leading to falsi ed inhibition constants or to fractionation campaign.Therefore, Mh-Tyr fractionation of extracts and fractions. Inhibition constants deter-mined with such assays for pure polyphenols have to be critically evaluated. Acknowledgements The research has been funded by GECT Euregio S\u00fcdtirol -Trentino (IPN55).

P-275 Bio-guided fractionation of essential oils looking for plant bioactive secondary metaboliteswith potential hypoglycemic activity Authors mellitus a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by a di culty in blood glycaemia maintenance. People in the world with diabetes have inc-reased dramatically over recent years and still are increasing. A possible the-rapeutic approach for treating diabetes mellitus is to decrease postprandialhyperglycemia, by inhibiting the carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes, such as-amylase. Thanks to its inhibition, carbohydrate digestion is stopped, and as a consequence glycaemia reduces. Examples of such inhibitors used in the cli- nical practice for treating diabetes are acarbose, miglitol and voglibose [1].However, these drugs are known to be associated with various gastro-intestinal side e ects, among others diarrhea [2,3]. The aim of this study is the research for new -amylase inhibitors deriving from plant secondary metabolism. A bio-guided fractionation approach,based on an in vitro -amylase inhibition assay, was adopted to isolate and identify the active fractions/compounds in di erent essential oils. Eighty-four essential oils obtained by distillation from di erent plant species and botani- cal families were submitted to the enzymatic assay.Three essential oils resulted particularly active ( Eucalyptus DC., fragrans Houtt.) with an inhibitory capacity comparable or slightly higher than acarbose, chosen as positive control. Theobtained results showed that all essential oil components seem to play asynergic e ect. Moreover, an interesting number of both hydrocarbon and oxygenated compounds were characterized by a good -amylase inhibition, around 30%. These preliminary results demonstrate that essential oils mayrepresent a promising source of potential -amylase inhibitors.

Expressions of 8 genes involving in the NF- B signal pathway was examined by an RT-PCR method in the liver tissue specimen. In our study, the e ect of Leucine amino acid, a kind of Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) on liverregeneration after PH in rats, was determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, andPCNA. Results showed cantly all summary, IL-6 proliferative levelsand reducing its pro-in flammatory signals, all of which optimize liver regene- ration. SOCS3 plays a dual role in modulating the rate of hepatocyte prolife-ration. In particular, this is the rst demonstration of an endogenous mechanism to limit hepatocyte proliferation after injury.

Still a major part of new drug entitiesis discovered by phenotype directed approaches in cells and animals [1]. Thescreening of natural products in phenotypic rodent models is however ham-pered by several disadvantages, e.g. nancial e orts, legal and ethical consi- derations, large quantities of test materials, in particular pure isolates and a challenging target deconvolution afterwards. Many of these problems can be avoided by using the simple roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans which serves as a convenient and pro cient addition to the set of current preclinical model organisms [2]. We recently established a robust C. elegans screening platform using 96-well plates for medium throughput screening of extracts and consti-tuents thereof for the discovery of natural products bene cial to the metabo- lic syndrome. Herein we present approaches and methods for C. elegans based preclinical screening using a combination of (i) optimized extract pre-paration, (ii) lifespan assay and (iii) fat accumulation assay.

The aim this work was to valorize oil-cakes, a by-product derivedfrom the pressing process of C. sativa seeds for food applications, given the presence of GLs, a class of metabolites known to be active against tumorcells. Selective extraction for GLs was performed by methanolic and aqueousextractions through maceration processes. After puri cation through Solid Phase Extraction columns, HPLC analysis was performed on all samples. GLswere the most abundant molecules in the extracts (1.5 mg/mL) as shown byNMR analysis, with small traces of residual lipids; proteins were not found byBradford assay. Human colon cell lines (healthy CCD841, cancer E705 andCaCo2) were chosen to test the e ects of GLs on viability through the MTT assay. First results did not show a considerable e ect, but a higher concentra- tion of GLs induced a noticeable selective e ect on viability between healthy and cancer cells. Activity of enzymes involved in detoxi cation, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase will be performed through spectropho-tometric assays, to evaluate cellular changes in response to a stress that doesnot induce signi cant alteration in the cellular viability.P-284 Cannabidiol-enriched sativa L. extract modulates University of Florence,Florence, Italy; 3Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy - Department of Excellence 2018-2022, University of Siena, Siena,Italy; 4Department of Physical Sciences, Earth and Environment, University of Siena, Siena, Italy; *equal contribution as rst author DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400011 Recent studies propose non-psychotropic Cannabis sativa L. as a candidate drug having a role in the pathogenic mechanisms involved in in flammation [1]. In order to evaluate the biological e ect of a chemically standardized ext- ract of C. sativa var. carmagnola dried female in florescences (CSE) and its main constituents, the purpose of this study was to investigate the modula-tion of cannabinoid receptors (CBr) and pro-in flammatory cytokines in an acute in flammatory stress in vitro model. CSE was chemically characterized by HPLC-DAD and GC. The CSE biological e ect was investigated on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) rstly exposed to the endotoxin LPS (2, 6, 24 hours) in order to evaluate CBr and cytokines regulation. Then,cells were pre-treated with CSE and its main components at the concentra-tion of 1 g/ml, followed by a 2 hours stimulation with the endotoxin LPS. CSE was found exposure to LPS signi cantly downregulated with CSE, and extract and its main constituent CBD were able to regulate the LPS- induced in flammatory PBMC response through the modulation of CBr expres- sion. These results contribute to support the role of the non-psychotropiccannabis compounds in the management of the in flammatory mechanisms. References [1] Borgonetti V, Governa P, Montopoli M, Biagi M.

P-286 Challenges in the discovery of natural products e ective against acute respiratory infections Authors of Life Sciences, University of Vienna, Althanstra\u00dfe 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria; 2Jena University Hospital, Institute Medicinal Microbiology, Section ExperimentalVirology, Hans-Kn\u00f6ll-Str. 2, Jena, GermanyDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400013 According to the WHO, lower respiratory tract infections are the fourthmost common cause of death globally and the rst cause in low-income economies. Mainly caused by in fluenza viruses and rhinoviruses, lethality is heavily boosted by co-infection with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus .T h e ecacy of antiviral drugs (e.g. neuraminidase inhibitors, NAIs) and anti- biotics is hampered by resistance issues. Remarkably, herbal remedieshave been successfully used to reduce respiratory symptoms throughouthistory.In a recently nalized project, we used this empirical knowledge for the selection of natural materials for antimicrobial studies, optimized our extraction protocol to avoid testing of promiscuous compounds, and explored the strengths and limitations of cell-based, target-based, and/orin silico strategies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of 162 natural extracts.As a result, we have established activity/cytotoxicity thresholds and aprotocol to discriminate between antiviral and dual-active agents and tocharacterize their mechanism of action [1, 2]. Further, a screening plat-form as tool for the identi cation of novel NAIs and their antimicrobial proling was established [3]. Our work flow applying a previously adapted extraction protocol for extracts and isolated natural compounds uses asophisticated set of di erent assays, which enables us to (i) recognize caveats, (ii) circumvent pitfalls related to assay interferences, and thusto (iii) generate reliable data on natural products targeting acute respira-tory infections.

The plant material was collected at two dif-ferent stages of development (vegetative and anthesis). The essentialoils were extracted by hydrodistillation according to European Pharmaco-poeia standards. The separation and the identi cation of the compo- nents were carried out using GC-MS.In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the volatile oils, twodierent methods were used: microplate method and the Kirby-Bauer diusion method. Chemical analysis of essential oils led to the identi - cation of 52 terpenes, among which linalool, carvone and p-menthan- 1-ol appeared as major compounds. Fo llowing testing of essential oils onStaphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli it was contingent that all the analyzed oils showed antimicrobial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration being of 0.1 % for all tested samples. The di usion method showed an evident inhibitory action for E. coli (40 mm) in the case of M. x piperita volatile oil (anthesis stage) versus 19 mm, in S. aureus species at the same sample. It can be concluded that essential oils of Mentha species possess great anti- microbial potential and could be used in pharmaceuticals and natural thera-pies of infectious diseases for humans or management of plant diseases.

Moreover, emerging antibiotic resistance complicates diarrhoeatreatment. Combination of compounds and antibiotics is considered as a newprospective strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. For example, aug-mentin (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid) is used to treat certain bacteria-cau-sed diseases such as urinary tract infections. In long time practice, variousplant-derived compounds such as berberine sulphate and berberine hydro-chloride are useful for diarrhoea control [2]. However, their combinatoryeect with conventional antibiotics against diarrhoea causing bacteria has only poorly been investigated.In this study, we tested in vitro combinations of plant compounds (e.g. berbe- rine chloride, tannic acid and sanguinarine) and their derivatives (e.g. 4, 8-hyd-roxy-5-nitroquinoline and zinc pyrithione) with selected conventionalantibiotics (e.g. cipro floxacin and tetracycline) against standard strains of diarrheagenic bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli and Shigella sp.). Minimum inhibi- tory concentrations of each agent and antibiotics were determined by thebroth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory StandardsInstitute [3] guidelines, whereas the combinatory e ect was evaluated accor- ding to the sum of fractional inhibitory concentration ( FIC) indices obtained by chequerboard method [4]. Several combinations (e.g. sanguinarine with tetracycline) showed additive eects against the majority of bacterial strains tested with FICI ranging from 0.507 to 0.531, whereas .

The arachidonic acid (AA) cascade is a key pathwayin inflammation, which metabolizes AA to a variety of pro and anti- inflammatory mediators. Due to the similarity of the lipid mediator sub- strates in the pathway, many involved enzymes share common featuresin their binding sites, and dual or multiple inhibition of the AA cascadeis not uncommon [1].Aims: This work aims to elucidate the similarities between the bindingpockets of several AA cascade enzymes, showing why multi-target interac-tion among these targets is prevalent in many anti-in flammatory natural pro- ducts. For this purpose, garcinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin E was docked into the enzyme structures from the AA cascade to investigate common bin- ding patterns. Garcinoic acid inhibits 5-lipoxygenase in the nanomolar range(IC50 = 35 nM) and also shows weaker e ect on other investigated enzymes: cyclooxygenase 1 in human platelets, revealed an alt ernative binding site on 5-LO, which was shown to be similar to the binding site of mPGES-1. Over-lapping binding site interactio n patterns could also be identi ed with LTC4S.Conclusion Multi-target e ects on related enzymes can be computatio- nally rationalized by binding site comparison, giving us the tools to anti-cipate such e ects and to intentionally search favourable target combinations.

Using a combination of Drug A nity Response Target Stability Assay in combination with a inhibitors as tacrolimus or rapamycin) was addressed as a poten-tial molecular target of CTS. The interaction of CTS with FKBP1A wasadditionally shown by thermal shift and enzymatic activity assays. Interes-tingly, CTS served as an activator of FKBP1A, which led to a reduced activityof the TGF receptor pathway and therefore to diminished CK1 and CK10 expression. The combination of the FKBP1A activator CTS with the inhibitortacrolimus neutralized the e ects of both compounds. From these data, a potential dermatological use of CTS and CTS-containing plant extracts (e.g.,hydroalcoholic extract from the roots of S. miltiorrhiza ) for keratinopathic ich- tyosis, a of CK1 and CK10, is sugges-ted.

Natural products such as piperine have been reported as allosteric GABA Areceptor modulators inter- acting with a benzodiazepine-independent binding site. For screening of largeextract libraries and e cient localization of active compounds via HPLC-based activity pro ling we established a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) membrane potential assay utilizing stably Chinese expressing GABA Areceptors of 122subunit composition. Assay protocols for rapid screening of plant extract libraries and localization of activecompounds in extracts were validated with known GABAergic natural products.An HPLC-based activity pro ling protocol was developed.

This study was aimed to assess the e ect of the OIE on the lipid level in high fat diet-induced mice. Forty-eight of male mice were dividedinto 6 groups; (1) Normal control (NC); (2) High fat diet (HFD); (3) High fat diettreated with 25 mg/kg/day simvastatin (positive control); (4) High fat diet trea-ted with 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day of OIE, respectively. At the end of theexperiment (4 weeks), mice were fasted overnight, and blood samples were col-lected to measure total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-densitylipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). During the study, foodintake, body weight, and toxicity signs were measured. The results demonstra-ted that OIE did not show any visible signs of toxicity. Food intake and bodyweight were also no signi cant di erence between HFD and OIE treated group (P< 0.05).

This study was to evaluate the e ects of V.cinerea L. crude extract on myometrial contraction in diabetic pregnant rats. Aftermating, the animals were divided into two group ( ve for each); non-gesta- tional diabetic rats (non-GD) and gestational diabetic rats (GD). At day 5 ofpregnancy, diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) i.p. At day 20of pregnancy, both groups of animals were sacri ced. Longitudinal muscular strips were dissected from uterus and placed in the organ bath containingKrebs 'solution for tension measurement. Control period was taken in stable spontaneous contraction 30 minutes before the exposure to high K +depolari- zation (KCl), oxytocin (OT), or V.cinerea L. crude extract. There were signi - cantly decreased frequency, amplitude and area under the contraction (AUC)with prolonged duration in GD. When exposure to KCl and OT, the responseswere signi cantly reduced in GD compared with non-GD. However, V.cinerea L. crude extract was signi cantly increased the frequency and AUC in both non-GD and GD. Impaired uterine contractility was found in gestational dia-betes. The application of V.cinerea L. crude extract stimulated uterine con- traction in both non-GD and GD. The treatment of V. cinerea L. crude extract may be helpful for preventing miscarriage or preterm birth, which is com-monly found in diabetes pregnancy.

Therecognition of S.aureus can be promoted either by opsonins (opsonic phago- cytosis), or by binding to surface receptors Theability of macrophages to directly interact with the recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [1]. Followinguptake, the killing of S.aureus is closely related with MAP kinases promoting of tra cking the bacteria into mature phagolysosomes [2]. The treatment of S.aureus infections is still poorly ensured and searching new drugs is highly needed. We tested the hypothesis that eupatoriopicrinthrough enhancement of phagocytosis suppress growth of S.aureus in phago- cytes (THP-1 cells). To verify this hypothesis we evaluated in fluence of eupa- toriopicrin tested at concentration range 2.5 -0.5 \u00b5M on (I) uptake of S.aureus by THP-1 cells performed by flow cytometry; (II) killing ability of THP-1 per- formed by CFU (III) MAP kinases modulation analyzed by wester-nblotting; (IV) cytokines release performed by ELISA tests and (V)morphology of THP-1 analyzed by confocal microscopy.Our observations showed that eupatoriopicrin-treatment enhanced the pha-gocytosis through signi cant increase of the number of phagocyted bacteria. We noticed correlation between modulation of MAP kinases signaling andsuppression of S.aureus growth which may be relate with promotion of pha- golysosomal acidi cation.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important antigeniccomponent of Gram-negative bacteria, and is a potent stimulus to local andsystemic immune responses. The stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) byLPS activates Myd88 pathway, what leads to release of proin flammatorycytokines, and, consequently, increase chemotaxis of leukocytes. Prolonged exposure to LPS signi cantly decrease cell viability of epithelial cells and intensify the necrosis.Therefore we tested the hypothesis that eupatoriopicrin may modulate LPS-induced in flammatory response. To verify this hypothesis we used lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and normal bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE)and veri ed the fluence of eupatoriopicrin (tested at 0.25 -2.5 \u00b5M) on: (I) of cellular membrane using propidium iodide staining, (II) expres-sion of adhesive molecules analyzed by flow cytometry, (III) modulation of TLR4-Myd88 pathway on epithelium using flow cytometry and immunoblot- ting analysis, (IV) cytokine release performed by ELISA tests and (V) apoptosisof epithelium analyzed by flow cytometry. Our observations showed that eupatoriopicrin-treated cells signi cantly expression resulted in Myd88 phosphorylation leveldecrease in A549 cells. We noticed suppression of the release of IL-6, IL-8a n dT N F in both epithelial models. Interestingly, we observed that eupatoriopicrin decreased the number of necrotic cells and increasedapoptosis.Eupatoriopicrin through modulation of the LPS-induced signal transduction isinteresting candidate for further evaluation as potential therapeutic agents in a treatment of in flammation-based pulmonary diseases.

Doxorubicin is one of the most potent and widelyused chemotherapeutic agents for various tumors, as breast cancer.However, doxorubicin clinical application is limited by cumulative anddose-related cardiotoxicity, which may lead to congestive heart failure[1]. Thus, this study aims to identify possible nutraceutical matrices ableto reduce the doxorubicin toxicity without modifying its antineoplasticactivity on breast cancer cells.We evaluated the onconutraceutical polyphenolic di erent mixes, composed by di erent ratios of the two matrices, on embryonic rat heart-derived cells (H9c2) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7),also in presence of doxorubicin.The tested extracts, as well as the relative mixes, don 'te x h i b i tas i g n i cant antiproliferative activity on H9c2 and MCF-7. In doxorubicin-treated cells,the orange and the grapes extracts, and the 3 mixes, reduce the antiproli-ferative activity induced by doxorubicin on H9c2. Interestingly, the doxoru-bicin antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 cells was unaltered, in presence ofthe tested extracts.

Theirgenomes typically contain over twenty biosynthetic gene clusters enco-ding for secondary metabolite pathways [1]. One of those are nonribo-somally produced peptides (NRP). They represent a structurally diversefamily of natural products with a broad spectrum of biological activities,e. g. antibiotic, anti-cancer and genome mining, i. e. screening and identi cation of these clusters employing bioinformatics [4].Aim of the project is to identify novel gene clusters by genome mining andto isolate the predicted products of these clusters as well as to evaluate theirbioactivity. An interesting candidate is Streptomyces fragilis which is predicted to produce an NRP by two NRPS ( Fig. 1 ). In order to isolate the predicted NRP, the substrate speci city of the adenylation domains of the two NR PS were determined by cloning, overexpression and - 18O4-ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assay [5]. l- Valine was found to be the predominant substrate for six out of ninetested adenylation domains. To ide ntify a valine-rich natural product produced by S. fragilis , 14C-valine was fed to a 25 ml culture. Culture extracts were analyzed by radio-HPLC and radio-TLC for radioactive com-pounds. One radioactive product was detected. Its identi cation is in process.Taken together, we have identi ed a cluster encoding for two NRPS with unusual substrate speci city which predicts the ability of this two NRPS to produce a new secondary metabolite.

Our results showed that calotropinand calactin at 1 M inhibited cell migration (wound healing assay) and proliferation (fase S entry) of the Hepg2 cancer cell line. They inducedapoptosis associated with activation of caspase-3 and increased p53expression, more than 35% and 45%, respectively, when compared with staurosporine used as positive control. Moreover reduction of GRP78, a general ER-stress marker was also observed. These ndings suggest that selected compounds from P. tomentosa are potential leads to be explo- red as anti-cancer agents.

Natural ingredients in cosmetic products may prevent or even reverse changes caused by ageing such as hyperpigmentation, loss of elasticityor skin hydration. Furthermore, they may hinder in flammatory processes in skin. The aim of this work was to prepare and compare the extractsof four medicinal plants (i.e. Glycyrrhiza glabra, vulgaris ) suitable for use in cosmetic pro- ducts. To achieve this, glycerol -a natural, non-toxic, eco-friendly liquid, capable of acting both as solvent and humectant in cosmetic products - was used. The content of species-speci c substances such as In radical activity of theextracts, activity glycerol e ciently extra- cted the active components of the selected medicinal plants. Eventhough all the prepared extracts were capable of slowing down ther-mally induced \u00df-carotene-linoleic acid oxidation and scavenged DPPHfree radicals, the most active in all the employed assays were G. glabra extracts. They were also able to inhibit up to 80% heat-induced albumin coagulation. Furthermore, G. glabra extracts inhibited tyrosi- nase activity, even when diluted in 1:100 ratio. The results indicate thatthe glycerol extracts of all the investigated plants and especially of G. glabra , are promising ingredients of cosmeticeutical products due to their antioxidant, skin whitening, and antiin flammatory properties.

Currently, S. scardica is investigated for its pharmacological activity in the central nervous system in which cognition-enhancing andneuroprotective properties have been described [1-2]. Dried leaves of S. scardica were extracted with 80 % ethanol, and the extract was suspen- ded in distilled water and successively extracted with solvents of increas-ing polarity. Selected extracts were fractionated by di erent chromatographic techniques and isolated compounds identi ed by NMR spectroscopy. Isolated compounds and extracts were tested in antioxi-dant and anti-in flammatory in vitro systems, as well as in cholinesterase inhibition assays. The 80% ethanol extract was of isoscutellarein and hypolaetin), phenylethanoids constituents. Antioxidantand anti-in flammatory e ects were ascribed to the high content of poly- phenols in the 80% ethanol extract. No was observed. Antioxidant and anti-in flammatory eects are suggested to play a protective role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our ndings may seem to be in compliance with previous in vivo ndings and should be followed up in future studies. References [1] Hofrichter J, Krohn M, Schumacher T, Lange B, and Pahnke J.

Advanced Glycation End Products and Oxidative Stress in within mushrooms that activate the dectin-1b signaling pathway are derived from colonizing yeast Authors Pugh ND1, Zhang J1, Pasco DS1,2 Institute 1National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, United States; 2Department of BioMolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi,University, United StatesDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400045 Research supports the theory that the microbiome of plants [1-4] andmushrooms [5] produce potent activators of pathogen recognitionreceptors which are principal contributors to the stimulation of macro-phages. We have previousl y reported [5] that the in vitro macrophage stimulatory activity of water-soluble extracts from 13 di erent types of edible mushrooms is predominantly due to Toll-like receptor agonists originating from the naturally occu rring bacterial communities within these materials. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whe-ther these 13 types of mushrooms con tain water-insoluble beta glucans that activate the dectin-1b signa ling pathway. Culinary mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus varieties) were essentially inactive, whereas most of the dectin-1b signaling pathway. A. bisporus mushrooms with no detec- table dectin-1b-dependent activity had yeast colony forming units thatwere 687 times lower than L. edodes mushrooms exhibit ing high activity (half maximal activation values between 6.8 and 11.7 \u00b5g/ml). Analysisof 12 commercial batches of L. edodes obtained from di erent sources indicated that 10 batches exhibite d moderate variation (half maximal activation values between 6.6 and 2 3.1 \u00b5g/ml) and 2 batches had mini- mal or no activity. The two batches that lacked activity were sourcedfrom companies that cultivated the mu shrooms in controlled laboratory environments that minimize the gro wth of microbial organisms.

Amongtested compounds, 2signicantly decreased extracellular melanin content in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC 50value of 5.75 M. Particularly, at 10 M melanin content is 1.6-fold lower than arbutin as the skin lightening agent at 730 M. Until now, the structure-activity rela- tionship of sesquiterpene lactones on anti-melanogenesis has not beenreported. To clarify their relationship (SAR) pro les, 12 ses- quiterpene lactone analogues were synthesized and evaluated the potentialfor melanin production. The results showed that all analogues did not displayany signi cant for this activity. Furthermore, compound 2had no e ect on mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity. This indicated that decreasing mela-nin was not caused by tyrosinase inhibition, which might a ect protein expression at a post-translational modi cation. These results provide the rst SAR pro le of sesquiterpene lactones and indi- cate that a double bond at C3-4 is the most e ective position on anti-mela- nogenesis withhydroxyl, ester moieties markedly decreased this activity.

Motility disorders are often chronic in nature and dramatically a ect patients 'quality of life. Due to the complex and sometimes unclear etiology of GI diseases, there is grand requirement of new drugs which could bringsignicant relief and control the severity of clinical symptoms. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the e ect of Bidens tripartita (Asteraceae) metha- (CYN) andflavanomarein (FLA) on the contractility intestinal smooth muscle specimens. The study was performed on porcine isolated jejunum strips. All experimentswere conducted under isometric conditions. The extract was tested at con-centrations ranging 0.001 to 0.1 mg/mL, individual phytoconstituents atdoses 0.001 to 100 \u00b5M. The obtained results revealed that all tested samplesinduced increased gut contractility in both - spontaneous motoric functionand ACh-induced reactivity. Among all tested substances, CYN turned tobe the most potent contractile agent and its prokinetic e ect was dose- dependent. FLA and LUT induced only a slight myocontractile e ect.Concluding, on the weight of these ndings in the porcine model, B. tripartita is unlikely to be successful as a therapeutic agent for diarrhea-inducing gast-rointestinal disorders but it may nd an application as a pro-kinetic agent for gastrointestinal disorders accompanied by diminished P-334 In vitro hepatotoxicity of Petasites hybridus extract (Ze 339) depends on the concentration, intrinsic cytochrome activity and the species DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400051 Ze 339, a CO 2extract prepared from the leaves of Petasites hybridus, possesses antispasmodic and anti-in flammatory e ects and is proven to be e ective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. To study possible hepatotoxic e ects of Ze 339, its main constituents and metabolites, a series of in vitro investigations were performed. Furthermore, di erent reconstituted fractions of the extract were examined in three in vitro test systems using hepatocytes: Two human cell lines, with lower and higher intrinsic activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes(HepG2, HepaRG) as well as a rodent cell line with high intrinsic activity (H-4-II-E) were used. Metabolic activity, assessed by the WST-1 assay, was chosenas indicator of cytotoxicity. To assess potential bioactivation of Ze 339 com-pounds, metabolic experiments using S9 fractions from rats, dogs andhumans, and isolated cytochromes (human/rat) were performed and the for-mation of reactive metabolites was assessed by of glutathione and glutathione disulphide. Apoptotic behavior was examined by determining activity the extrinsic and the intrinsicpathway. Modi cation of mRNA expression of genes involved in adaptive, cel- lular defense mechanisms was examined by quantitative real-time polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) in HepaRG cells. Our data revealed that the cytotoxi-city of Ze 339, its single constituents and main metabolites depends on theconcentration, the intrinsic cytochrome activity of the cell system and the spe-cies used (rat > dog > human).

Monomolecular anti-in flammatory and anti-pyretic drugs are extensively used in infection related symptoms, butthey do not trigger virus replication. Also herbal drugs are traditionally used[1], although speci c anti in fluenza activities are rarely recorded and little investigated.

It is activated by various stimuli like cytokines and bacterialproducts. NF B controls over 150 target genes, including genes regulating immune response and in flammation [1]. Recently we have found that an active component of Epipremnum pinnatum ,-damascenone, was able to inhibit the induction of NF B-dependent genes in human endothelial and monocyte-like cells stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that acti-vates the NF B signalling pathway via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [2]. The goal of the present work was to examine whether -damascenone can also inhibit the cellular response to the proin flammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1, inhibited E-selectin mRNA expression in HUVECtert cells and TNF- gene expression in THP-1 cells stimulated by either IL-1 or TNF . We conclude that -damasce- none acts at the post-receptor level, most likely via inhibiting the NF B sig- nalling pathway, which is shared by all three receptors.

A 50% sub-inhibitoryconcentration of the antibiotics was used in combination with the extract toevaluate -lactamase inhibition potential. The results from this study showed that a number of Actinobacteria extracts was able to enhance the activity of ampillicin at a concentration of 1mg/mL. In addition, the active extracts dis-played weak inhibitory activities (<20% cell growth inhibition) when testedagainst the same resistant strain in the absence of the antibiotic.

(Asteraceae) on HT-29] using the SRB 4possessed strong cytotoxicity against HT- 29 with high selectivity between cancer, and normal (BEAS-2B) cell lines [2].In the continuation of this study, we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic potentialof these guaianolides against di erent human cancer cell lines, i.e. cervical (HeLa), and lung (A549), and a normal human cell line (BEAS-2B) using theMTT method. In addition, we rstly assessed their mutagenicities in silico by combining knowledge-based and statistical-based approaches. Among thetested compounds, 1,a n d 2showed the strongest activities with 50values of <4 \u00b5g/mL on HeLa, A549, and BEAS-2B. We also revealed that 1, 3, and 4 were non-mutagenic, while 2was mutagenic. As a conclusion, this study rstly reported cytotoxicities of the isolated guaianolides against HeLa, and A549cell lines, as well as their mutagenicities. Our results suggest that 1,a n d 2can be regarded as promising candidates for discovering anticancer drugs, and determination of their cytotoxic mechanisms.

The objectives of the present studywere to verify the behavioral changes in female rats that received 1mg/kg of the aqueous extract of the dried fruits from buchinha-do-norte (BNE), that was administered via gavage during gestation for ve conse- cutive days, between the gestational days GD17 to GD 21. The behavio-ral parameters were evaluated at the 50th day after delivery (PND50) inopen eld (OF) and light-dark box (LDB) apparatuses. Females were divi- ded into control and experimental groups (CG, EG). All the locomotion,exploratory and anxiety parameters observed in the OF did not showsignicant di erences between EG and CG (p>0.05). EG showed an anxiety-like behavior in relation to CG, due to the EG remained moretime in the dark side than that in the light side of the box (p<0.05).

According to recent literature, adult male rats have under-gone microscopically and macroscopically testicular changes extract of buchinha-do-norte (BNE) [1]. The present study aimed to compare how the oral administration of BNE tosexually-experienced adult male rats (150 days-old) and the prenatalexposition (from Gestation-Day 17 to Gestation-Day 21) of sexually-inex-perienced young adult rats (60 days-old) to BNE, at a dose of 1mg/kg/5consecutive days, in fluenced the testicular macroscopical parameters and the testosterone concentration in the blood. Four groups were then analy-zed: control group and experimental group for the adult rats (CGA andEGA), and for the young adult rats (CGY and EGY). Body weight, testisweight, cranial-caudal axis, lateral-lateral axis and testis volume were hig-her in the older males (p<0.05), while the testis relative weight showedto be signi cantly and EGY (p<0.001). Also, testoste- rone serum levels were higher in the young adult rats, despite their sexinexperience (p <0.05). Present ndings suggested that the direct admi- nistration of BNE, via gavage, may have caused impairment in the relativeweight of testis from the adult rats and provoked impairment in the tes-tosterone levels, despite the sexual experience of the rats.

It is a complex global public health challengethat leads to prolonged illness and increased mortality, increases the costsfor the health-care sector, and has an impact on animal health, which alsocould lead to an e ect on food production [1]. The development of resis- tance-modifying agents (RMAs) can mitigate the spread of bacterial drugresistance and possibly extend the useful life of an antibiotic, importantly inconsideration of the lack of new antibiotics [2]. We investigated the activityof nine methanolic extracts of plants, which were used traditionally to curewounds, and some single substances as an RMA of multi-resistant clinical iso-lates of and which can be involved in wound infec- tions. The extracts and single substances were combined with ampicillin,piperacillin, imipenem, vancomycin, gentamicin and aztreonam and theeects were investigated with the chequerboard method. We found 29 com- binations that worked synergistically, mainly with ampicillin and gentamicinon the gram positive strains. The highest diminishment of antibiotic resis-tance shows the extract of Cetraria islandica with gentamicin (MIC 16 to 0.001953125 of Salvia cinalis vancomycin (MIC 256 to and glycyrrhizic acid with gentamicin shift: 131072 resistant onEnterococcus faecium .

Exactly thesame pattern was observed in two further assays: These fractions and sub- stances also protected dopaminergic neurons of strain BZ555 from 6-OHDA-induced degeneration (quanti able through fluorescence intensity) and they reduced the number of aggregates of Q40::YFP, a polyglutaminepeptide, in strain AM141.

Juniperus species have been widely used as herbal medicine from ancient time [1,2]. The presentstudy aimed to evaluate antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities as well as ex vivo neuroprotective eectof hydroalcoho- lic extracts of leaves and three Juniperus species ( J. communis L.,J. oxycedrus L. and J. phoenicea L.) growing wild in Croatia. All tested Juniperus extracts were rich in polyphenols (3.0-3.9%). They possessed DPPH (IC 50:3 115-186 reducing properties 50: 14-22 g/mL) to inhibit lipid peroxidation (IC 50: 51-60 g/mL). The most potent inhibitory activity against AChE showed J. phoenicea and J. oxycedrus (IC50:4 2 g/mL and 72 g/mL, respectively). Neuroprotection induced by extract treatment was evaluated in a model of cortical sprea-ding depression described as a potential triggering mechanism in mig-raine.

Speci cally, several polycaprolactone/polyethylene gly-col (PCL/PEG)] and sca olds were assessed for the rst time for their biocompatibility upon cell seeding.A/S-loaded and non-loaded sca olds were produced as previously reported [2]. The sca olds were cut in 8 mm discs, seeded with human foreskin bro- blast cells (Hs27) and cultured for up to 7 days. Several physicochemical andbiological characteristics were evaluated: drug content, in vitro drug release prole, sca olds morphology by SEM, cell viability at di erent time points by MTT assay and cell in ltration by confocal microscopy. All A/S-loaded sca olds displayed a favorable matrix to cell attachment. After 7 days of culturing, the ber mats demonstrated adequate cell viability with PCL-A/S and PEGylated PCL-A/S showing increased proliferation compared tonon-loaded PCL and PCL/PEG sca olds.

This led to the following hypothe- sis that fungi -another kingdom with \"immobile \"reproducing structures - might also possess highly photoactive compounds. To test this hypothesis, apreviously established work flow [4] was used to rank the PDT-activity of several basidiomycetes.While fungal extracts with pigments derived from the shikimate-chorismatepathway or the mevalonate pathway exhibited no signi cant activity, those containing dyes from the acetate-malonate pathway and nitrogen heterocyc-les were characterized by promising 1O2-producing activities. Nevertheless, the obtained results pointed out that not all photoactive pigments are ableto induce a photo-activated cytotoxic e ectin vitro . The hypothesis of a photochemical defense mechanism in the kingdom Fungiwas tested. By investigating a set of diverse basidiomycetes, we were able tohighlight the fact that pigments derived from the acetate-malonate pathwayare promising photosensitizers.

We found that the aqueousextract was the most e ective antioxidant, the strongest acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibi tion; the methanol extract showed the highest -glucosidase inhibition, while the ethyl acetate extract was the most e ective on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, and -amylase. The total flavonoid content was highest in the aqueous and ethyl acetate extract, respectively. Finally, we found that all extractswere e ective in reducing LPS-induced activity of pro-oxidant inflammatory biomarkers including nitrites, LDH, PGE2 and 5-HT, in rat colon, with the best activity showed by ethyl acetate extract.

Since the number of clinical studies is limited, pharmaco-epidemio-logical research can be an important source of information. To gaininsight into the use of herbal medicinal products, data from the Phyto-VIS study, the world 's largest pharmaco-epidemiological study on the use of herbal medicinal products [1], were evaluated focusing on thepaediatric population.The PhytoVIS data set has been captured in doctor\u00b4s o ces and pharmacies in compliance to the ENCePP Code of Conduct [2].2063 data sets from paediatric patients were evaluated, thereof 254from patients below 2 years, 473 from patients age 2-5, 551 from age6-11 and 785 from age 12-17. The majority of patients (67.7%) wastreated because of common cold and fever, other were gastrointestinaldisorders, injuries and pain among others. Co-medication was docu-mented in 24,9% of patients. The e cacy of the therapy was rated very good in 48,4%, good to moderate in 36.8%, missing in 4.0%.93.7% experienced no adverse events at all, only 0.8% felt a markedimpairment due to side e ects. Neither the e cacy nor the tolerability seemed to di er within age groups. The results shed light to a eld of pharmacotherapy and give a picture of the use of herbal medicines in an unselected cohort of paediatric patients. Theyclearly show the safety and therapeutic usefulness in children. They o er good background information for therapeutic decisions based on overalltolerability and perceived e ect.

Chronic high blood pressure mayresult in heart disease. Oxidative stress is the disturbance of the redoxhomeostasis and produces excessive levels of reactive oxygen species,which plays a central role on hypertension-induced heart failure. We exami-ned the e ect of PPDV on hypertension-induced heart disease. Mice were infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce hypertension, leading to heartfailure. In the treated group, PPDV was treated in mice daily with Ang IIadministration. After 14 days of Ang II infusion, cardiac hypertrophy and b- rosis were found in mice. PPDV treatment Ang II-induced hypertrophy and brosis. PPDV SMA (a brotic marker) and NADPH oxidase (an enzyme produced super- oxide) expression. These all contributed to the improvement of cardiacfunction of PPDV. Our results provide new insights regarding the cardiopro-tective e ects of PPDV, which provides an e cient therapeutic strategy to attenuate heart disease.

The most common preparation for the treatment of wounds and skin in flam- mations is the infused oil obtained from the aerial parts, containing naptho-dianthrones, phloroglucinols and essential oil (EO); however, there is muchcontroversy in the scienti c community regarding the composition and stabi- lity of this formulation [1]. Extensive literature survey shows, that Hypericum EO not yet been evaluated regarding the wound healing e cacy, although many studies report antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, gastroprotec-tive activities [2].In the present growing wild in Greece ( H. perforatum - empetrifolium -HE, H. jovis, H. triquetrifolium -HT) were in hydro-distillation to obtain their EOs. GC-MS analyses revealedthe presence of 137 individual compounds representing 87.8-96.8% of thetotal EOs. Hypericum L. is generally classi ed as EO-poor genus; only three taxa (HP, HE, HT) yielded enough for in vivo tests, which were conductedin hairless SKH mice. Measurements such as transepidermal water loss, hyd-ration, redness, thickness and elasticity were performed. Statistical analysisinterestingly showed some signi cant wound healing properties (p<0.05) of HT and HE in low concentration (0.05%). This is an ongoing project and theresults will be further evaluated by photodocumentation and histopatholo-gical examination. References [1] Jari D, Pavlovi M, Pavlovi P.

Up to date little is known about the chemical composition and pharmacological activity ofaerial parts of H. palustris . It has been used in folk medicine for treating diseases, including heart problems [1]. The aim of our work was a prelimi-nary assessment of the chemical composition by LC/MS technique and thecytotoxic potential of an alcoholic extract from above-ground parts of thisplant. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using human cancer cell lines:MDA-MB-231 cells, HeLa, endometrial cancer cells Ishikawa, colorectalcancer DLD-1 cells normal skin broblasts CCD-25Sk. The examination of the phytochemical pro le of the alcoholic extract revealed the presence of rare methoxy derivatives of flavones and triterpenes as major consti- colorimetric assay was conducted the extract exerts concentration-dependent inhibition ofcell viability. The MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cell lines were the most sensitiveto the extract at each concentration. MDA-MB-231 cells showed 67%, 52%,23% cell viability, and HeLa cells 74%, 61%, 16% viability of control cells afterincubation with extract at 30, 100 and 300 g/mL, respectively. However, inhibition of cell viability in broblast was similar or higher compared to cancer cells. Further studies of the chemical composition and biologicalassays are in progress.

Thepresent study aimed the evaluation of the o spring sex ratio from mothers that received the treatment of 1,0 mg/kg/ ve days of the aqueous extract obtained from the fruits of L. operculata , during a late period of gestation, GD17 to GD21. Sexage was performed at prost-natal day 2 (PND2), and it was veri ed that the experimental group presented a signi cant higher number of female pups (t=2.163, df=31, p=0.0386) than that of the control group, while the number ofmales diminished as expected (t=2.247; df=31, p=0.0319). According to the Tra-vers-Willard hypothesis, female mammals are able to adjust o spring sex ratio in response to the maternal condition [2]. In the present study, mother 's condi- tions were directly in fluenced by the oral administration of L. operculata ,w h i c h may have caused physiological alterations in the pregnant body, leading thegestation to privilege female born. F emales are more likely to be mated even standing in an adverse condition, while males in unfavorable conditions tend tolose their mating chance to a male under a better health condition. The prenatalexposition to L. operculata changed the homeostasis of pregnant rats which cau- ses the improvement in the rate of female born spring.References re- dini IB.

The considerable interest in iridoids is due totheir ecological role as plant protectant and to their wide spectrum of biologicalactivities, including cardioprot ection, tohave potent activity [2-3]. Angiogenesis process may be invol-ved in tumour development, thus its inhibition appears to be a promisingapproach in anti-in flammatory and anticancer therapies [4]. Within this context, the aim of the present study was the isolation and characterization of iridoidderivatives from two Lamiaceae species, Stachys ocymastrum (L.) Desf. aerial parts, belonging to Plantaginaceae family, together with the evaluation oftheir antiangiogenic potential. The chemical study of investigated plants a or- ded to the isolation of one new and fo ur known iridoid glycosides from S. iridoid diglycosides from P. resinosa, and ten new and ve known iridoid glycosides from A. pedatum ,i d e n t i ed by NMR and MS analyses. The antiangiogenic e ects of the isolates were reported on new blood vessels formation using two in vivo models: zebra sh embryos and chick embryo cant antiangiogenic activity in both assays, reducing the growth of blood vessels. Weaker antiangiogeniceects were also observed for some other iridoids, thus suggesting this class of compounds as promising antiangiogenic agents. References [1] Leticia J, Jack LB. Iridoids.

There- fore, the development of useful materials from marine plants is one of impor-tant contributions to human health. For this purpose, we previouslyinvestigated numerous marine plants on various biological activities. As aresult, Agarum clathratum subsp. yakishiriense showed amelorative e ect hearing loss. A. clathratum subsp. yakishiriense Yamada ex G.H. Boo & P. C. Silva is a perennial brown alga in the family Costariaceae andis widely distributed in the coastal area of the East Sea in Korea [1]. The EtOHextract of A. clathratum subsp . yakishiriense was CH 2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH. Among these fraction was subjected to column chromatographic separa-tion. Two new and a known monogalactosylmonoacylglycerols were isolatedfrom the EtOAc fraction. The structures of two new monogalactosylacyl glyce-rols were as (2 S)-1-O-(6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-hexadeca- from spectral data and A known compound, (2 S)-1-O-(6Z,9Z,12Z-hexadecatetraenoyl)-3- O-- D-galactopyranosylglycerol ( 3), was identi ed by comparing its spectral data with literature values. The isolated compounds were investigated the amelora-tive e ect on neomycin-induced hair cell damage in zebra sh.

Then,concentration-response curves (CCRCs) to RW and GB (10-10 g/L - 10-3 g/L)were determined using the organ bath technique. The role of theendothelium and the nitric oxide (NO) pathway was evaluated by performingCCRCs on either des-endothelialized veins or veins incubated with NO path-way inhibitors (L-NAME or ODQ). The antioxidant e ect of both RW and GB was estimated by an acetylcholine test. A reference CCRC was rst performed to validate the oxidative e ect of homocysteine (a superoxide anion genera- tor) and the antioxidant e ect of tempol (100 M). Then, tempol was replaced by RW (30 g/L) or GB (100 g/L). RW produed a relaxation which was inhibited on both des-endothelialized rings and on rings incubated with L-NAME or ODQ. Homocysteine-induced im- pairment of was restored by RW and GB. Theseresults showed that RW and GB exert veins vasorelaxation but also antioxidant eects. The vasorelaxant e ect of RW mainly involved a role of the endothelium and NO pathway, while GB induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxation.We showed that RW and GB on EDVs. GB reported in equine clini- cal practice could be linked at least to their vasculo-protective action thatrequires further investigation in laminitic horses.

A daidzein derivative compound,8-hydroxydaidzein (8-HD), isolated from fermented soy has attention due to various pharmacological bene ts, including anti- inflammatory activities. However, regulation of the in flammatory signaling mechanism for 8-HD is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to theIRF-3 signaling pathway. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanismof 8-HD in regulating in flammatory processes, with a focus on the IRF-3 signa- ling pathway using a of by phosphorylation of IRF-3 transcriptionfactor. The inhibitory mechanism of 8-HD in the IRF-3 signaling pathway partlyrelies on the ability of 8-HD to inhibit TRAF3 and IKK interaction, which subse-quently downregulates phosphorylation of AKT and reduces activation of IRF-3, thereby mediating inhibition of IRF-3-dependent gene [1] Tarassishin L, Suh HS, Lee SC.

Glycosylation of protein formed in aromasuntreated cells and were distinct from damaged protein that were targeted intolysosomes for degradation. Glycosylation was promoted in active 100kD recep-tor, and glycosylation untethering was mediated by recruitment of -glucosidase to extracellular by geraniol to drive sugar chain hydrolysis and thereby inactiva-tes the receptor. Functionally, glycosylation marks sites proliferation and di e- rentiation of stem cells, allowing regulation of neural networks by stem cells,whereas conversely, glycosylation regulates receptor activity via -glucosidase. Glycosylation thus allows directional regulation of receptor dynamics, and mayexplain the dysfunction observed in lysosome in Medica 2019; 85: 1386 -1590 1545 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the presence of a state of oxidative stress and dysfunction of the cholinergic system. Sa ower seed is mainly contained various anti-oxidant and cholinergic improvementcompounds, such as serotonin and its derivatives, while the e ect of Sa o- wer seed in improving cognitive dysfunction has not been reported. In thisstudy, we employed a scopolamine-treated learning and memory de cit mice to explore whether Sa ower seed could alleviate cognitive dysfunction. Saower seed water extract (SWE) was orally administered at dose of 100 mg/kg/day, and then behavior tests such as T-maze and novel object recogni-tion test were conducted. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, reactive oxy-gen species (ROS) production, and antioxidant enzymes in the brain weremeasured. In behavior tests, novel route and object recognitions wereimproved by administration of SWE, indicating that SWE improved memory function in the scopolamine-treated mice. Also, SWE-administered groupshowed inhibition of the AChE activity. In addition, administration of SWEshowed the lower ROS production and higher antioxidant enzymes levelscompared with the scopolamine-treated vehicle group. The present resultssuggest that SWE improves scopolamine-induced memory de citsviainhibi- tion of cholinergic dysfunction oxidative As a result of HPLC analy-sis, SWE contained serotonin and its derivatives serotonin and N-(feruloyl) serotonin. Therefore, sa ower seed might be a promising candidate for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.

For this, the plant extracts ( n-hexane, dichlo- romethane and methanol) and isolated fractions from active extracts weretested against di erent cancer cell lines using a cell metabolic rate estimation assay. Dichloromethane and n-hexane extracts of tubers of the plant showed marked activity against both adherent and non-adherent cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and CCRF-CEM). To identify the constituents responsible for this activity,column chromatographic fractions were subjected to LC-DAD-MS and LC-HRMS analyses for dereplication. The analyse s revealed tubers lignans, predominantly lariciresinol and pinoresinol. These lignans showed moderateactivity against the cancer cell lines com pared to the crude extracts. Therefore, isolation and structure elucidation of further active compounds is in progress. References [1] Amaral RG, Dos-Santos SA, Andrade LN, Severino P, Carvalho AA.

Some natural products have already been identi ed as AGEs inhibitors, however connected to diabetes and other degenerative diseases but still poorly studied in skinaging. Marine species have received great attention as sources for naturalphotoprotective agents and unique biomolecules, which are often a result ofadaptation strategies to the extreme marine environment [2]. Therefore, ourstudy focused on secondary metabolites from various marine inclu-ding from seagrasses that were isolated by using various chromatographic techniques. Their structures were determinedby nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, and the compoundstested in two di erent fluorescence based in vitro assays to investigate their collagenase and pentosidine-like AGEs inhibitory e ects. In total, 24 substan- ces were investigated mostly showing comparable IC 50values in both assays. For example, IC 50values around 75-150 \u00b5M were determined for the MAAs. Interestingly, the sulfated flavones from Zostera marina exhibited higher activi- ties than their non-sulfated equivalent, e.g luteolin-7,3 -disulfate showing an IC50of of 60 \u00b5M compared to luteolin with 0.4 mM. Some substances showed even higher activities than the standard inhibitor rutin.References [1] Gkogkolou P, B\u00f6hm M. Advanced skin aging? Dermatoendocrinol 2012; 3: 259 -70.

However, data on the cytotoxicity e ects of this plant are limited [1,2]. In the study the following extracts from aerial parts of P. alba were used: MeOH assaysfor assessing cells viability were used. The tests were carried out on humancolon tumour (HT29) and normal epithelial (CCD 841 CoTr) cell cultures. InNR uptake method, PAL7 extract (25 \u00b5g/mL) had the strongest cytotoxic (by18% compared to the control) potential against cancer cells. Extracts PAL1,PAL4, PAL5 and PAL6 signi cantly decreased the viability of cells (to 83% com- pared to control) at 225 \u00b5g/mL concentration. PAL4 extract (125 \u00b5g/mL), wasthe most active against normal cells decreasing their viability to 77% compa-ring to the control. In MTT method, PAL2, PAL4, PAL7 extracts at concentra-tions lower than 125 \u00b5g/mL increased up to 60% the succinatedehydrogenase activity. When normal cells were analysed, the enzyme acti-vity was not a ected by the PAL2 and PAL3 extracts. The remaining extracts in a concentration dependent manner stimulated the enzyme activity in nor-mal cells. P. alba extracts depending on the concentration used, type of sol- vent and type of cells exerted di erential e ects in the context of cell viability and the action of selected Krebs cycle enzymes.

As a result, between 2 to 32 g/mL concentrations, the compounds signi - cantly reduced such as , and TNF- ranging from 1.10 to 8.46-fold to the control (PMA-ionomycin), while indu-cing IL-1 and IL-17A. The most potent compounds DAC-AST VII (3.32- fold) for production of IL-1 , and AST VII (5.05-fold) for production of IL-17A. According to the cytokine release pro les, these compounds as single entities or in combination might have chance to be developed as vaccine adjuvants,and further studies are in progress to elucidate the mechanism of action.

It is a 2-estrogen receptors agonist, having a similar molecular structure with endogenous estrogens [1]. Hormonal decline occurring in postmeno-pausal women causes decreased libido, besides other unplesant symptomslikeflushes, dryness of the vaginal mucosa etc. [2]. The purpose of this study was to highlight estrogen-like e ects of genistein in female rats castrated prior to the onset of puberty. Four groups of female rats were divided as fol-lows: lot GEN (10 castrated rats treated with genistein i.p. 10mg/kg/day for 8weeks), lot ESTR (10 castrated rats treated with 10 \u00b5g/kg bw/day 17 - estradiol for 8 weeks), lot OVX (10 castrated and untreated rats) and lotNORM (10 rats in control group). The rats were left in the presence of themales for 2 hours a day and were monitored for one week. The prospectivebehavior (male interest) and the copulative behavior (lordosis) were evalua-ted. Results: There was a signi cant di erence in rats behavior towards male, in the OVX lot compared to GEN, ESTR and NORM, as they became aggres-sive in the presence of the male. There was no di erence between the beha- vior of the rats in the NORM and ESTR group, which shows that the hormone replacement therapy with estradiol was e ective. In the GEN lot, the pre- sence of prospective behavior was observed, but the number of lordosis posi-tions adopted by animals was lower than the NORM and ESTR lot. The studydemonstrates the in fluence of genistein on sexual behavior, but the agonist- antagonist e ect depending on the endogenous level of estradiol should be also considered.

This contribution describes the extraction of plant material,the enrichment of bacosides via liqui d-liquid-extraction (LLE) and solid- (SPE), and the assessment of the biologic activity ofthe obtained extracts. The extracts were tested regarding their di e- rentiation inducing activity of neuronal adult stem cells by an in vitrodual luciferase assay. To transfect the cells, a speci cp r o m o t e ro ft h e doublecortin (DCX) gene was used [5]. Expression of DCX indicates theneuronal di erentiation and the current neurogenesis [5]. For this test, primary mouse embryonic forebrain cells were transfected using refly luciferase driven promoter and Renilla luciferase as a cont- rol [5]. After LLE and SPE an enrichment factor of ve was determined using Bacoside A as reference substance. Some extracts containing fla- vonoids show slight di erentiation inducing activity, while others are not active. For further biologic investigations the neuroprotectivepotential of these extracts will be tested. References [1] Rauf K, Subhan F, Al-Othman A, Khan I, Zarrelli A, Shah M.

In this study, we invest igated the possible synergistic e ects ofAlpinia and allopurinol in decreasing uric acid level in rats with potassium oxonate-induced hyperuri-cemia. We examined the e ects of allopurinol Alpinia oxyphylla on the serum uric acid, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in hyperuricemic rat model. The e ects of allopurinol plus AE on the xanthine oxidase AE signi cantly decreased the uric acid leading to the normalized serum uric acid concentrations. Fur-thermore, the combination of allopurinol and AE decreased the serumcreatinine and BUN levels. The attenuation of hyperuricemia-inducedrenal dysfunction was related to the inhibition of both serum andhepatic XOD activity. The anti-hyperuricemia e ects of allopurinol are improved by combination administration of Alpinia oxyphylla .A sa n edible fruit, Alpinia oxyphylla has a good safety record in humans. Our results suggest that the combined use of allopurinol and AE may havea clinically potential value in the treatment of hyperuricemia.

This structurally rather diverse group is divided into hydrolysable (gallotan-nins and ellagitannins), complex and condensed tannins.[1] Since they areomnipresent in various plant tissues, they also represent a common componentof food (e.g. ellagitannins in berries, epigallocatechin in green tea). Tannins arebelieved to exert several health enhancing e ects,[2] although those e ect are rather di cult to study.[3] Therefore computational studies can provide us with some guidance of possible molecular mechanisms of tannin actions.In this study we examined chemical scavenging capacity of three tannin basicbuilding blocks (i.e. gallic acid, ellagic acid and (-)-epicatechin) against nine ultimate carcinogens of the epoxy type at the Hartree-Fock level of theory in conjunction with flexible basis sets and implicit solvation models. The reacti- vity of tannin basic building blocks was then compared to the reactivity ofidentical ultimate carcinogens against guanine, which represents the mostreactive nucleobase of DNA.[4] The tannin basic building blocks with reacti-vity towards ultimate carcinogens that exceeds the reactivity of guaninewere presumed as good scavengers of ultimate carcinogens. The studiedmonomeric tannin building blocks exhibit a signi cant scavenging potential, with (-)-epicatechin representing the best scavenger. References [1] Khanbabaee K, van Ree T.

H. pylori cag +strains are clinically related to more severe outcomes of gastritis, like ulcers and cancer. The present study investiga-ted the biological e ect of tannins-containing extracts from Castanea sativa Mill., using in vitro models of gastric in flammation. Gastric epithelial cells (AGS and GES-1) were stimulated with TNF (10 ng/mL) or co-cultu- red with di erent bacterial strains from clinical samples. Interestingly, IL-8 and IL-6 release after 6 h was found cagA independent. Basing on our previous work on TNF -challenged cells and chestnut fruits, we tested the eect of the extracts in AGS co-cultured with H. pylori cag +(ATCC strain). Extracts from fruit episperm and rich in condensed tannins,inhibited H. pylori -induced IL-8 release at 25 g/mL, compared to 5 g/ mL during previous TNF treatments. Moreover, we investigated the e ect of an extract from chestnut leaves, rich in tannins, which was never pre-viously evaluated against gastric in flammation, in addition to castalagin and vescalagin, ellagitannins which occur in bark and leaves. ext-ract inhibited TNF and H. pylori -induced inhibited TNF -induced IL-8 with same IC50 (0.04 M), whereas H. pylori -induced IL-8 was impaired at 50 M.

P-389 Targeting mechanisms of the DNA damage response (DDR) by natural products Authors Stuijvenberg JV1, Proksch P2, Fritz G1 Institute 1Institute of University D\u00fcsseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225 D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany; 2Institute of Universit\u00e4tsstrasse 1, 40225 D\u00fcsseldorf, GermanyDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400095 Natural products (NP) are important lead substances for the design of newand potent anticancer therapeutics. The common target of approved conven-tional anticancer drugs is the genomic DNA of tumor cells. If the DNA isdamaged, a complex stress response, called DNA damage response (DDR), isactivated. The kinases ATM and ATR are the key regulators ensuring the coor-dinated regulation of DNA repair, activation of cell cycle checkpoints andapoptosis. Therefore, mechanisms of the DDR are attractive target structuresfor the development of new therapeutic approaches. The aim of the study isto identify NP derived from endophytic fungi, plants, lichens or marine spon-ges that in fluence the DDR. For this purpose, the cytotoxic and DDR modulating potency of 296 naturalcompounds, used alone or in combination with the cAT cisplatin or doxorubi-cin was investigated by fluorescence-based of histone 2AX ( H2AX), a surrogate of DNA damage. Upon, analyzing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), other types ofDNA damage and the in fluence of the NP on the DDR on protein level, a total number of 10 natural products were identi ed that interfere with the DDR in monotherapy and/or modulate the cAT-stimulated DDR. No interactions withdrug transport mechanisms were ascertained.Based on these results and published data we suggest the NP 5-epi-nakijiqui-none Q, 5-epi-ilimaquinone and secalonic acid F as most promising NP-basedlead structures for future testing. Mode of action and their anticancer activityin tumor cells of di erent origin will be determined in forthcoming studies.

This process is frequently accompa-nied by a disturbance of the sexual function, which can also be caused bystress from the clinical picture and the associated fear of sexual failure.Toinvestigate if WS \u00ae1541 has a positive e ect on the sexual behavior in rats, we used a stress-induced sexual behavior model, which leads to a reduction oflibido. In this experiment male rats were exposed once daily for 3 days to a 30minutes interruption of the light/dark cycle, 60 minutes after treatment. Theanimals were treated daily with WS \u00ae1541 (100, 300, 900 mg/kg) or vehicle over three consecutive days one hour before stress. For the measurement ofsexual behavior males were placed for 12 minutes together with estrus syn- chronized ovarectomized females. The total number of mounts and of licking the penis was counted. In the stressed group treated with vehicle a signi cant decrease of the total number of mounts and of licking the penis in comparisonwith the vehicle treated unstressed group was observed. The treatment withWS \u00ae1541 signi cantly antagonized the sexual dysfunction in a dose depen- dent manner in comparison with the vehicle treated stressed group.These results demonstrate that WS \u00ae1541 used for the treatment of BPH also reduces sexual dysfunction in a stress-induced rodent model. These resultsshould now also be investigated in a BPH model together with a stress induction.

More than 50% of men aged over60s have BPH and 15 to 30% of those a ected su er lower urinary tract symptoms, such as, urinary retention, bladder infection, bladder calculi,or renal failure [2,3]. BPH known to depend on androgens [4], espe-cially dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the predominant and hypertrophic prostate glands. DHT is synthesizedfrom testosterone by two isoenzymes of 5 -reductase, that is, types 1 and 2 [5], and type 2 5 -reductase (5AR) is found predominantly in prostate. An excessive accumulation of DHT leads to hyperproliferationof stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate gland which results in prostate size increase. Therefore, the inhibition of the enzyme, 5AR and thus normal masculinization appears to be one of the sensitive targetsfor the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. During the search foractive natural resources to treat or improve the symptoms of BPH, itwas found that the extract of Sida rhombifolia L. showed the potent inhi- bitory e ects on 5AR2 enzyme activity. This study aimed to investigate the bene cial e ects of extract of S. rhombifolia (100 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) for 6 weeks markedly attenuated prostate enlargement and reducedserum and prostate levels of DHT and 5AR in testosterone propionate-treated rats. The expressions of androgen receptor, prostate speci c antigen (PSA), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the pros-tate tissues were remarkably suppressed in the extract-treated rats.Through activity-guided isolation, the compounds belong to terpenoidhave been successfully isolated from the extract of S. rhombifolia .T h e structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by extensive e ects of S. rhombifolia extract on of rats with testosterone-induced prostate hyperplasia suggest that the extract of S. rhombifolia and its active con- stituents may be useful for the treatment of prostate hyperplasia.

The concomitant administration of OLEU and DXR signi cantly retarded tumor growth, particularly of melanoma. Additionally, the DXR-induced chronic cardiotoxicity was reduced ( FS ~4%) in mice treated with the OLEU/DXR combination compared to animals trea-ted only with DXR ( FS ~10%). Further experiments concerning the impact of this co-treatment protocol are needed to acquire more holistic and solidconclusions.

HDL-mediated cholesterol e ux from macrophages is an impor- tant mechanism to prevent foam cell formation, and an early step in thereverse cholesterol transport pathway, for subsequent excretion of choleste- rol in bile. Major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis are the nuclear recep- tors LXR (liver X receptor) andthat promote the expression of cholesterol eux transporters, like ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) [1].

In addition, the ratio of free cholesterol to total cholesterol was increased upon treatment with soraphen A, whichled us to hypothesize that an increased level of cholesterol metabolitesmay act as ligands for LXRs.In conclusion, soraphen A enhances e ux from THP-1-derived macrophages viaABCA1.

The complex alkaloid composition of the species is still under explo-ring, and so is the bioactive potential of the plant. The phytochemical pro le that determines the biological activity is di cult to characterize due to large number of compounds produced in the plant and the multitude of factorsdetermining their formation. The aim of our research was to evaluate theantimicrobial potential of C. majus extracts obtained from intact plants and in vitro cultures. Phytochemical analysis showed that roots contained higher number and amounts of alkaloids in comparison to aerial parts. All testedplant extracts manifested antimicrobial activity, related to di erent chemical structures of the alkaloids. Root extract used at 31.25 - 62.5mg/L stronglyreduced bacterial biomass. From the seven individually tested alkaloids, che-lerythrine was the most e ective against P. aeruginosa (MIC at 1.9 mg/L), and sanguinarine against S. aureus (MIC at 1.9 mg/L). Strong antifungal activity was observed against C.albicans when chelerythrine, chelidonine and aerial parts extract was used. The experiments with plant extracts, individually tes-ted alkaloids and their mixtures allowed for a deeper insight into the poten-tial mechanisms a ecting the activity of this group of compounds.

Ryeand hairy vetch were cultivated alone and together in pots lled with micro glasssbeads. Plant were grown for three weeks in climate chamber and theirroot exudates were collected for the chemical analysis.

Quanti cation results displayed that both hairy vetch and rye are altering their root exudation in response to rye-hairy vetch co cultivation.

However, M1 and UA outside of the plantextract present a signi cant higher cytotoxicity and have no e ect on cellu- lar oxidative stress while OBE100 no-triterpene fraction reduces the oxida-tive burst. OBE100 treatment also inhibits the expression of adipogenic andlipogenic genes (PPAR- ,C / E B P , SREBP-1c, ACC) and increases the expres- sion of lipolytic genes (PPAR- ) in a higher level than the triterpenes outside the extract. These results suggest triterpenes present in Eu have anti-obe-sity properties but the combination of these triterpenes with other minormolecules present in the vegetal extract may have a synergistic or additiveeect that improves them, reducing their toxicity and improving their bio- logical properties.

The potentialof natural products for treating obesity is under exploration and interesthas increased in the development of treatments from natural sourceswith fewer adverse e ects. Ursolic acid lactone (UAL) is a triterpene of Eucalyptus tereticornis (Eu)[1][2]. Triterpenes consti- tute a large family of plant natural molecules with diverse structuresand functions and have been found to m anifest hypolipidemic, anti-obe- sity and antidiabetic activity[3]. The purpose of our study is to analyzeif UAL have similar properties. A cru de methanolic extract (OBE100) from leaves of Eu was partitioned with ethyl acetate, concentrated andpuried by Sephadex LH-20. were used to evaluate UAL e ects. We determined treatments concentrations after the analysis of cytotoxicitylevels of the molecule. We found UAL reduced 32% adipocyte lipid con- tent after 7 days of treatment compared to 18% reduction by metfor-min treatment. This e ect was accompanied by inhibition of leptin production. We also found that this triterpene stimulated up to 24%glucose uptake in muscle cells. To the best of our knowledge, it is therst time that UAL has been proven t o exhibit anti-lipogenesis e ect in adipocyte cells and stimulation glucose uptake in myocyte cells sugges-ting its potential future application as antiobesity and antidiabeticagent.

P-401 Using animal model systems to evaluate the impact of botanicals on the gut microbiome Authors 2University of Illinois, Chicago DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400112 We have reported that Rhodiola rosea increased lifespan and improved healthspan of fruit flies [1]. The fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster, is emerging as an important model system in biomedical research to evaluate the impactof various interventions on a number of phenotypes including changes in themicrobiome. The main hypothesis of this project was that \"Rhodiola rosea improves healthspan by modulating the microbiome \". We tested our hypo- thesis in flies and then in mice with two main aims: 1) to examine whether Rhodiola rosea improved the healthspan of fruit flies by changing their micro- bial composition and 2) to evaluate the impact of Rhodiola rosea on the mic- robiome of leptin de cient mice. Flies and were fed a normal diet and were randomized to either receive Rhodiola rosea or control sig- nicantly altered the microbiome of Drosophila and increased the ratio of the genus Acetobacter and decrease the order Lactobacillales throughout the life- span and increased the total bacterial load throughout the fly lifespan [2]. We then evaluated the impact of this plant extract on the gut microbiome ofa severe diabetic and obese phenotype in mice; leptin de cient mice. Our preliminary data showed that Rhodiola rosea improved glucose levels and changed the microbiome of leptin de cient mice. We are now in the process of a more detailed data analysis. Animal model systems, both insects andmammals, can be used in the pre-clinical stage to evaluate the impact ofbotanical extracts on the gut microbiome as it relates to their healthspan.

Depending on morphologicalcharacteristics and availability, this species is divided into two varieties such asP. frutescens var. frutescens, the oilseed crop for source of perilla oil, and P. fru- tescens var. crispa for the aromatic leafy herb [1]. In addition, P. frutescens var. crispa (Jasoyeop in Korean) can be further categorized based on various mor-phological forms in leaf shapes and colors and flower colors. In this study, to investigate the variation in bioactivities among Jasoyeop varieties, we selected varieties based on their characteristic leaf colors like green-leaved forms, pur-ple-leaved forms, mixed color-leaved forms, and leaf forms that are purpleonly on the abaxial side. Selected Jasoyeop varieties have been classi ed intothree chemo-types, according to the main components of their essential oils. Comparative analysis on anti-melanogenic, anti-in flammatory and anti-cancer activities was preformed using 70% EtOH extracts obtained from leaves ofeach varieties. Although no signi cant di erence in anti-in flammatory activity between varieties were detected, the extracts of Pfc 51 exhibited the highestanti-melanogenic activities and Pfc 13 and Pfc 22 extracts strongly inhibitedthe proliferation of human lung cancer A549 cells. The di erence in activities seems to be related to the variations in phytochemical content and composi-tion between varieties. The variations observed here should be useful forselection of a bene cial material for the food and pharmaceutical industries. References [1] Kim HU, Lee KR, Shim D, Lee JH, Hwang S.

Weight gain was not observed in female pups (p<0.05),while the male pups showed weight gain (t=2.206, df=33; p=0.0344). Previouswork [1] stated that BDN oral administration to adult male rats did not causeweight gain, while the young male pups which received a prenatal exposition toBDN showed weight gain.

Taking into consideration that the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are e ective in only 70% of the patients, the discovery of new AEDs with novel mechanisms of action is avery important task. There is a large body of literature reporting research onthe antiepileptic e ects of plants, with several plant-derived compounds, such as cannabidiol, cannabidivarin and huperzine currently under develop-ment as AEDs [1,2].The aim of this study was to perform an initial zebra sh-based evalua- tion of the antiepileptic activity of Pimpinella major (L.) Huds. (Apiaceae), plant used in traditional medicine for treating mental disorders, and iso-late its main active constituents. The methanolic root extract of P. major was screened in a zebra sh epilepsy model based on the GABA- Aantagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), which induces an increased and epileptiform electrographicactivity in zebra locomotor activity by 45.87%. As a puri cation tool that enables fast and e ective separation of compounds, high-performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) led to the isolation of pimpinellin (16 mg, purity > 98%) from 738 mg of crude extract in 30 minutes. Additionally, three other couma-rin derivatives were isolated and tested. Of these, pimpinellin (60 M) was able to potently decrease PTZ-induced locomotor activity by 63.79%.Thus, the HPCCC and zebra sh epilepsy model could be used as e cient platform for the fast identi cation and isolation of compounds with pro- mising antiepileptic activity.

The PhytoVIS study, a pharmacoepidemiological data base on the use of herbal medicinal products [1], containing data from 20,870 users of herbalmedicinal products, which have been captured in doctors 'practices and pharmacies in compliance to the ENCePP Code of Conduct [2], was scree-ned for users of STW 42. Patients included all age groups and most descri-bed their symptoms as cough resp. dry cough. 126 patients used STW 42syrup and 15 STW 42 lozenges. Nearly 90% of the users rated the e cacy of the product as moderate to very good, only 3.5% reported their conditionto be unchanged or worsened. The e ect tended to be rated better in moderately severe as compared to mild symptoms. Overall tolerability wasvery good.Together with the information on more than a thousand patients documen-ted in earlier surveys [3, 4], these data underline the e cacy of STW 42 in relieving cough symptoms and its good tolerability. They further support itsuse not only in adults, but also in pediatric patients, where it presents itselfto be a safe and highly used option, so giving a useful insight into epidemio-logy as well as data regarding e cacy and safety of STW 42.

A standardpractice group received advance dressings, e.g. hydrogel, foam, and algi-nate. Study setting was home-based care in 7 hospitals in Thailand. Sixty-six patients with at least a PU, in stage 2-4 or unstageable [2], were alloca-ted to two groups equally by minimization method. The Pressure UlcerScale for Healing (PUSH) scores was used to monitor 6-week PU healing[3]. PUSH scores of both groups reduced signi cantly comparing to the scores at baseline.

Anxious patients often su er from short sleep duration and poor sleep quality as a consequence of theiranxiety disorder.The e ects of lavender oil on the Hamilton-Anxiety-Scale (HAMA) item 4 'insomnia 'were investigated systematically in a pooled dataset. A meta-analysis of ve clinical trials was performed to describe subsequent eects of lavender oil on sleep in patients with anxiety. We examined the accompanying symptoms regarding sleep based onitem 4 'insomnia 'of the HAMA after ten weeks of treatment. The HAMA total score was the main outcome variable of all trials. Withinthe single trials the change between baseline and the last value undertreatment was analyzed using a model of covariance analysis withtreatment as a factor and the baseline value of the outcome variableas covariate. A random e ects meta-analysis was performed to com- bine the results of the single trials.The ratings of 1172 patients were included in the analysis. In the pooled dataset a mean baseline value of 2.7 points (moderate to severe) for insom-nia was rated in the lavender oil group and in the placebo group.

Given the high relevance of these indications in children (2), there is the need for treatment options applicable in this age group.A systematic review was conducted focusing on FD and IBS in children, sear-ching for clinical studies and reviews via PubMed-Medline complemented byhand searching and cross-referencing.The search gained 79 hits for FD with 13 of which 2 were herbals. For IBS itgained 321 hits, 5 on herbal treatments. Herbal options mentioned for IBSwere Psyllium, Peppermint oil and STW 5 (Iberogast) as well as Turmeric,Cannabis, Aloe vera and Ginger, with clinical studies in children mentionedonly for Psyllium, STW 5 and Peppermint oil [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. For FD Hippophaerhamnoides and STW 5 were identi ed with clinical evidence on both [1, 6]. Only Iberogast was mentioned for both diseases. A number of studies sup-ported the therapeutic usefulness in children of all ages, retrospectively [7,8] as well as prospectively [9 -14]. Data from 44.315 children showed an excellent safety pro le with only few mild side e ects and a convincing rating of the therapeutic usefulness.Herbal preparations provide e ective treatment options in children with FD and IBSwith a low risk pro le and therefore play a prominent role in their management. While Psyllium and Peppermint oil as well as Hippophae rham-noides show evidence only for IBS or FD respectively, grades of evidence aremost convincing for Iberogast likewise in FD and IBS.

The use of STW 5 (Iberogast \u00ae) for treatment of functional gastrointestinal diseases is supported by a multitude of clinical, pharmacological and toxicological stu-dies [3].Pharmacy customers with product desire or recommendation for STW 5received a questionnaire with the product to be answered within a week.Data from 843 patients were evaluated. The majority was 30-49 years old,70.6% were female. In 384 patients, complaints were related to the upper, in139 to the lower abdomen, in 311 patients to both regions. In 7.3% of patientsa functional dyspepsia had been diagnosed, in 16.9% of the 139 patients an irri-table bowel syndrome. Up to 64% of the patients speci ed a good or very good improvement of the predominant symptom after treatment. Symptom reliefwas perceived as fast and covered the comprehensive spectrum of complaints.Tolerability was rated good to very good in 97.4% of all patients. Correspon-dingly 93.2% of the users were very satis ed\"orsatised\". 91% of the custo- mers would recommend STW 5 to others.It can be concluded that this pharmacy-based survey gives a reliablepicture of the view of patients on ST W5 ,w i t hh i g hs a t i s f a c t i o nv a l u e s as well in irritable stomach as in irritable bowel syndrome. Theratings are well in accordance to the favorable ratings of tolerabilityand patient perceived satisfactio n from the clinical studies on the product. References [1] Nieber K, Lehmacher W.

The follo- wing parameters were recorded: subjective e cacy, individual patients` ference, tear lm breakup times (TBUT), lissamine green staining of the cornea, symptoms grade, Schirmer test, ocular surface disease index (OSDI).Furthermore, physical properties (viscosity/surface tension) of the eye dropswith and w/o mallow extract were analyzed.With HA+M in improved from 'moderate 'to'mild '/ 'normal ', whereas with the competitor w/o mallow extract, this rate was only 60%. No di erence was shown for TBUT, lissamine green staining, symptoms or Schirmer test. However, subjective e cacy perceived by patients and the patients 'preference was superior for HA+M. Rheology of eye drops is negatively in fluenced by HA concentration as eviden- ced by concentration-dependent increase of viscosity. Notably, in HA-contai-ning eye drops plus mallow extract surface tension was signi cantly reduced. Reduction of surface tension and thereby prevention of tear lm break-ups represents an important physiological mechanism provided by surfactantproteins in tears. Although there was no di erence in lubrication between the two treatments, HA plusmallow extract is perceived superior by patients over an HA-only product. This superiority might be mediated by the reduced sur-face tension caused by mallow extract.

P-420 Salvia extract for the treatment of menopausal symptoms: a randomized, controlled, blind clinical transition is typically accompanied not only by hot flashes but also by mood alterations and sleep disorders. Salvia o cinalis has been tradi- tionally used to treat those symptoms.Eighty (80) menopausal women between 48 -65 years of age received Menosan \u00aetablets [3 400 mg ethanolic extract of Salvia o cinalis ]o rp l a c e b o under randomized double-blind conditions for 4 weeks. The primary clinical end-points menopausal rating scale [MRS] and hot flush severity and incidence [HFS] were monitored throughout therapy and were nally correlated with quantita- tive electroencephalographic [qEEG] measurements in protocol analysis.Salvia o .potently reduced MRS by 39.2% from 15.3 \u00b1 6.87 to 9.3 \u00b1 5.75 and signicantly in comparison to placebo (p=0.002). The somato-vegetative subscale improved 1.84 55.3% \u00b1 13.77 to 7.1 \u00b1 7.41, reaching signicance compared to placebo on week 3 onwards ( Fig. 1 , p=0.0284). Sleep quality as per qestionnaire [SF-B/R] and fatigue in pro le of mood state [POMS] signi cantly improved with Salvia , whilst the non- signicant trend only. Clinical e ects of Salvia o .found a pharmacological correlation in changes of alpha1/2, delta, theta and beta1/2 qEEG values.Menosan \u00aeSalvia showed a signi cant and clinically relevant amelioration of the broad complex of menopausal symptoms with a high speci city on hot flushes.

It aims to describe the epidemiology, medical needs and perceived e ectiveness of the therapy with these products [1]. In this setting, it is of special interest to evaluate the res-pective data on the St. John\u00b4s wort ( Hypericum perforatum L.) preparations used in psychic depression to identify potential speci c patterns of its thera- peutic use.The total database of 24,056 patient questionnaires was screened for the useof a leading product in this eld, Laif 900. Epidemiological data on gender, age and disease state as well as on the use an perception of the herbal pro-duct were evaluated.80 patients taking Laif 900 were identi ed. The majority of patients was female. The general tolerability of the product was good. In 41% of allpatients the perceived e ect was very good, and another 43% gave it to be moderate to distinct. Only 4% of patients perceived no e ect. Due to the provenience of the present data from a large non product-speci c survey, they augment, despite of the rather small sample size, the availableevidence on Hypericum products in moderate depression. The majority of patients gave the e ect to be moderate or better with more than a third sta- ting it to be very good. This con rmed the positive rating of its use already described in previous non-interventional and interventional studies [2].

Data on the useof STW 5 [1] in FGID were selected from the PhytoVIS study, a non-interventional study in 20,870 patients who had used a herbal productwithin the last 8 weeks before the survey [2]. The aim was to describethe epidemiology, medical needs and the perceived e ect of the therapy in these patients.Questionnaires related to STW 5 were evaluated regarding epidemiologicaldata on gender, age and disease state as well as on the use of the medicineand its perception. Fig. 1 Change of hot flush severity score during 4 weeks treat- ment document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. From the PhytoVIS data 1515 patients taking STW 5 could be identi ed. About two thirds of the patients had symptoms associated with FD, ca. onethird associated with FD or IBS. 94% of patients reported the therapeuticexperience to be moderate or better, 63% stated it to be very good, with 30%of all patients experiencing an e ect after a few minutes, 80% after some hours. Side e ect pro le and tolerability of STW 5 were convincing. PhytoVIS turned out to be a suitable tool to study the epidemiology of patientswith functional GI diseases treated with STW 5. STW 5 proved to be a fast-actingtherapeutic option rated positive not onl y in a vast variety of gastrointestinal complaints, but also regardless of factors like the age of the patients, thusmaking it an interesting option for vulnerable patient groups and patients su e- ring from often multi-causal gas trointestinal diseases with di erent symptoms.

GA Congress Shanghai 2018, PO-1252 P-423 Treatment of restless legs syndrome with Bryophyllum pinnatum :ac a s es e r Clinic Arlesheim, 4144 Arlesheim, SwitzerlandDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400132 Restless legs syndrome (RLS) may seriously a ect patients 'sleep and quality- of-life, but established pharmacological therapy often have severe sideeects. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Preparations of both sedative and musclerelaxant properties [1]. Moreover, prospective observational trials revealedgood e ectiveness in the treatment of sleep disorders with Bryophyllum pin- natum 50% chewable tablets [2,3]. We set out to experimentally treat RLS patients with preparations of Bryophyl- lum pinnatum [4]. The pre/post comparison of polysomnography tests revealed a fre-quency reduction of periodic legs movements during sleep (PLMS) infour out of our ve patients, most interestingly, also in the two patients with the highest PLMS indexes. Moreover, patients with lowsleep-e ciency, moderate sleep-latency and high arousal index at treatment-begin could show improvement for these sleep parameters.The one patient who did not show improvements either in RLS symp- toms or in sleep quality was able to abstain from benzodiazepines,which favourably a ected her health status. Questionnaire results were in line with the polysomnography data.This case series suggests that RLS treatment with Bryophyllum pinnatum pre- parations (mainly 50% chewable tablets, or the lactose-free alternative, 33%mother tincture) can reduce restless legs symptoms and improve sleep qua-lity. Spasmolytic properties and the sedative e ect of Bryophyllum pinnatum preparations seem to play a role. Randomised controlled trials with appro-priate size and treatment duration are urgently needed.

The presentstudy aimed at nding the antimicrobial potential of ethanolic leaf extracts from C. collinum . The phenolic pro le of the ethanolic extract could already be characterized in previous studies [1]. However knowlegde about the lipo-philic part of the extract is still scarce. In order to obtain further informationon the lipholilic components of C.collinum , a GC-MS analysis of the hexane extract of the leaves was performed.During the GC-MS-analysis 22 new substances including myristic acid, palmi-tic campesterol,stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol could be identi ed by comparison with spectra from the NIST2 database.The antibacterial activity of the ethanolic extract of C. collinum against eight bacterial strains was evaluated by comparing the diameters of the inhibitionzone with standard antibiotics. Subsequently, the MICs of the extract weretested against selected bacterial strains that had been shown to be sensitive.Inhibition zones were found for the ethanolic extract of and MRSA .

DNA barcoding analysis successfully con rmed the identity of most unproces- sed market samples as C. rotundus , and samples fell into two subgroups within the species. Two main processing types were detected within the C. rotundus sample set of TCM origin, dried with the brous roots removed and sliced/dry- fried. The Ayurvedic C. rotundus rhizome market samples were of high macros- copical conformity, and adhered to the standards set by the Quality Standardsof Indian Medicinal Plants [1]rather than the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India[2]. The generated HPTLC pro les correlated with the traditional origin of the material and were una ected by the processing type. By providing an amalgamated investigation on the C. rotundus rhizome mate- rial available to EU consumers, this study highlights the signi cance of the traditional background of materials.

P-428 Coumarins and anthelmintic A-type procyanidins from the roots of 48, roots of Paullinia pinnata L. are used in West Africa as traditional remedies for a variety of diseases including infestations withsoil-transmitted helminths [1]. Based on the results of an ethnopharma-cological survey in Ghana [2] an aqueous acetone (70%) extract wasinvestigated in this study for its anthelmintic and phytochemical proper-ties. The crude extract showed in the extract. The anthelmintic activity of OPCs is well known [3], however related B-type trimer procyanidin C1 (86 % vs. 47 % at 1 mM respectively).In addition to the OPCs, a glucosyloxy-4-methyl-2(5H)-furanone along cleomiscosins A-D and the novel isofraxidin-7-O--D-glucopyranosyl-(1 6)--L-rhamnopyranoside, were isolated. None of these compounds contributed to the anthelmintic activity, however, thepresence of coumarins has not been described previously for Paullinia species.In summary, this study provides an insight into the composition of phenoliccompounds in the root extract from P. pinnata and is one of the rst investi- gations of A-type proanthocyanidins against nematodes, supporting A, Hocquemiller R.

This in vitro study aimed to undertake an initial assessment of the potential inhibitoryimpact of a standardized Guazuma ulmifolia aqueous bark extract drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450enzymes (CYPs). GUABE is used across the Caribbean for a number ofhealth conditions and, in Jamaica, often used in root tonics, a commonlyconsumed health beverage. Results indicated potent inhibitory activityagainst CYPs 1A2 and 3A4 (IC 50= 5.2 and moderate activity against CYPs 2C9, 2C19 and (IC 50= identi procya- nidin 2( P2) as the most abundant phytochemical present. Assessment of P2 against the activity of CYPs and 3A4 demonstrated mode- rate analysis, using index analysis,indicated slight synergistic interaction between GUABE and P 2 for the inhibition of CYP1A2. P 2, whilst not solely responsible for the observed potency of GUABE against CYP1A2, appears to play a part throughsynergistic interaction with other phytochemicals present in the extract.The potent inhibition of CYPs 1A2 and 3A4 in vitro , provides a useful preliminary indication of the potential for adverse herb-drug interactions and warrants further in vivo and clinical studies. P-430 Cytotoxic e ect of (Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai) extracts on human melanoma SK-MEL-2 cells Authors Yoo T, Hyun TK Institute Department of Industrial Plant Science and Technology, College of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, Chungbuk National University,Cheongju genus with a single species of deciduous shrub in the olive family, has been used as an ornamental plantdue to its horticultural value. Current pharmaceutical studies have revealedthe pharmaceutical application of A. distichum based on its anti-diabetic activity [1] and anti-in flammatory e ect [2]. Although these indicate the considerable potential of A. distichum as a crude drug and a dietary health supplement, studies on the biological activity of A. distichum have been limited. In this study, the methanolic extracts of of A. distichum leaves, stems and fruits were evaluated for cytotoxicity to human melanoma cell(SK-MEL-2). MTT assay revealed that leaf extract at 50 g/ml, 100 g/ml and 200 g/ml reduced 13.69% of caspase 3 furtherdemonstrated that apoptosis induced by leaf extract. To investigate themolecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis induction, cells were treatedwith leaf extract for 48 h, and western blot analysis was performed usingspecic antibodies. Western blot analysis suggested that anti-proliferation and apoptosis induction by leaf extract should be associated with MEK - ERK-dependent caspase activation. Taken together, these results suggestthat A. distichum leaves have compounds with cytotoxicity against SK-MEL- 2 cells, and could be developed as a potential source for improving humanhealth.

Nowadays wound therapyfaces resistances against multiple microorganisms and new agents derivedfrom nature are in demand. One of those traditional herbal medicines is thebalm of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst., Pinaceae) which has beenshown to be e ective in subjects with chronic wounds by clinical trials. [1] [2] However, the active constituents, their mode of action and the quantitativecomposition remain unknown.For this reason the isolation and identi cation of constituents with the subse- quent examination of their e ect in an in vitro re-epithelialization model was targeted. Flash chromatography, SFC, HPLC-UV-DAD as well as LC-MS, 1D-and 2D-NMR were used for isolation and structure elucidation of pure com-pounds. A potential e ect on proliferation or migration (re-epithelialization) in a HaCaT keratinocyte based model was examined by monitoring the clo-sure of a gap in the cell monolayer.Four extracts of Norway spruce balm and nine pure compounds (resin acids,their hydroxylated derivatives, the labdane diterpene abienol and the lignanpinoresinol) were tested in the cell model. Among them three compoundswere detected to induce a faster closure of the cell free area compared to thevehicle control.First insights into the complex composition of Norway spruce balm were gai-ned. Additionally the e ect on re-epithelialization could be -at least in part - traced back to some of the isolated pure compounds.

Since there are no rm experimental proof to support the rationale of this practice, we aimed to assess the in vivo eect and safety of Stellaria media tea in hypercholesterolemic rats. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups. Beside control group, whoreceived standard laboratory chow, the hypercholesterolemic group receivedcholesterol-enriched diet, and the chickweed-treated hypercholesterolemicgroup received cholesterol-enriched diet and 100 mg/kg Stellaria media tealyophilizate for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected to determine liver and kidney function and serum lipid pro le, and echocardiography was perfor- med to assess cardiac morphology and function.The serum total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels were signi - cantly elevated, but no change were observed in triacylglycerol concentra-tions in group receiving cholesterol-enriched diet. The treatment withchickweed did not cause any signi cant change in serum lipid pro le or in body weight increase. Moreover, liver and kidney functions were unaltered,cardiac morphology and function were not changed due to Stellaria media tea lyophilizate.Although chickweed does not seem to be toxic when consumed as tea, ourresults do not support the rationale for its use in the treatment ofhypercholesterolemia.

Today, many animal and plant species are threatened withextinction, even in the sacred forests which are usually rigorously protec-ted. Within the Guinean Manon community, the protection of biodiversityhas always obeyed their beliefs and cultural values through their sacredforests 1-2. Today, these forests are shrinking alarmingly. Aim. To evaluate the vegetation in sacred forests in Guinean Manon area. Results. An inter-view of 45 indigenous traditional healers and patriarchs led to the collectionof 128 plant species from which 110 were identi ed in the sacred forests. These plants are mainly used in the management of prevalent infectiousdiseases.

Periodontitis includes diverse in flammatory circumstances that are common in diabetics and arise due to bacterial bio lms produced by quorum sensing (QS). The current project aims to evaluate the e cacy of certain herbs and formualtions to eradicate bio lms and inhibit quorum sensing of oral patho- gens. Plants were extracted with 90% methanol using cold maceration. A pri-mary analysis of extracts was performed using UHPLC and ATR-FTIR. Clinicalstrains from female diabetic patients were isolated and identi ed using 16S rRNA. A total of 35 medicinal plants were analyzed and a signi cant Against active against most tested clinical strains.

The most common treatment for chro-nic in flammatory diseases are nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Their long-term use, however, may cause a series of adverse eects. The goal of this research is to nd plant based alternatives and novel compounds with the ability to improve classical treatment of chronicalinflammatory diseases. [1] The dichloromethane, methanol and water extracts of Albizia julibrissin DURAZZ. bark have been found active in an anti-in flammatory assay at 50 g/ ml in extraction fractionation of the activecompounds, all 6 fractions showed inhibitory activity on NO production.However only the lipophilic fractions 1-3 did not interfere with cell viability,compared to cells treated with solvent control. Therefore, the reduced pro-duction of NO in cells treated with the polar fractions 4-6 is most likely dueto cytotoxic e ects. Active components of the extracts and the active compounds of Albiziaecortex are investigated by LC-MS dereplication and isolation.

(Salvadora- ceae) are important sources of plant-based tooth-cleaning sticks (miswak) commonly used for oral hygiene throughout the Arabian peninsula and thewider Muslim world [1][2]. Also the leaves of the plant are traditionally eatenas salad and used for medicinal purposes [3], but studied in less detail so far.Therefore, the aim of this study was the phytochemical and pharmacologicalinvestigation of S. persica leaves. The phytochemical composition of a methanolic S. persica leaf extract was assessed by LC-HRMS analysis. Some of the major compounds were assignedas the glucosinolate glucotropeolin and as a series of kaempferol and iso-rhamnetin glycosides.Furthermore, the oral health promoting-e extract (SPML), of glucotropaeolin (GT) and of benzylisothiocyanate a glucotropeo-lin product formed by myrosinase-catalyzed cleavage ( Fig. on anti-in flammatory and anticancer activity. Only BT was able to inhibit the growth of HNO97 human tongue carci-noma cells. Also LPS/IFN- -induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells was only inhibited by BT. However, SPML as well as GT and BT potentlyinhibited IL-1 ,T N F - and IL-8 production in neutrophils stimulated with LPS. Moreover, SPML and BT strongly inhibited ROS production in thismodel.Since primed and hyperactivated neutrophils are known to be involved ininflammatory oral diseases like periodontitis [4], the e ects observed for SPML, GT and BT in stimulated neutrophils may substantiate the traditionaluse of S. persica leaf preparations for oral health purposes.

This process generally a ects the phytoche- mical pro le and the bioactive principles in fruit and vegetables. To appraise the variation in bioactive principles of rosehip from Rosa rugosa Thunb. during its ripening process, we analyzed the changes in antioxidant and anti-elastaseactivities and polyphenolic compounds during the four ripening stages of rose-hips. Overall, an extract of unripe rosehip (stage 1) contained the highestlevels of total phenolic and flavonoid contents, radical scavenging activity,reducing power, oxygen radical antioxidant capacity and elastase inhibitory activity, compared with the extracts of rosehip at other stages of ripening. Inaddition, we found that the reduction of flavonoid content occurs because of decreased transcriptional levels of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway during ripning process. Based on HPLC analysis, we found that theextract of unripe fruit contained highest amount of myricetin(0.00\u00b10.00to1.51\u00b10.76 g/10 mg of extract), ca eic acid(7.18\u00b10.20 to 39.69\u00b12.76 10 mg of extract), p- coumaric acid(0.00\u00b10.00 to 15.68\u00b11.69 g/10 mg of extract), and suggested that the antioxidant and anti-elastase activities of the extract obtained fromstage 1 should be mediated by the presence of these compounds. In addition,we analyzed the interaction sites and patterns between these compunds andelastase using the structure-based molecular docking approach, and sugges-ted Chlorogenic acid strongly interacted with elastase. Taken togather,these ndings suggest that the maturity of rosehip has profound e ects on the pharmaceutical value of Rosa rugosa Thunb. P-445 Proper planting density for direct seedling of 5 years old ginseng in rain shelter house Authors Yoon YJ1, Lee KJ1,Y iJ H1,M oY M1, Lee GW1,K oJ Y1, Won JH1 Institute Ginseng & Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Gangwon Agricultural Research & Extension Services, Cheorwon, KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400147 Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer ) is widely cultivated in Korea as a medicinal herb. Gangwon-do(Province), especially in the northern part state of SouthKorea, has a favorable environment for ginseng cultivation due to its cool cli-mate. So, the area of ginseng cultivation in Gangwon-do is Steadily increas-ing. Conventional ginseng cultivation uses an inclined shading facility. Inorder to improve productivity and reduce workforce, it is necessary to culti-vate using rain shelter house and direct seedling. It is possible to reduce thenumber of pesticide spraying (12~15 times 2~4 times). Therefore, gin- seng production also increases more than twice as much as conventional cul-tivation. Direct seedling in ginseng cultivation using the rain shelter house isexpected to reduce the labor, improve growth and promote eco-friendly cul-tivation. In this study, we conducted to determine the proper planting den-sity of 5-year-old ginseng in the rain shelter house. We conducted the studythrough four treatments; 63, 72, 108, 180 root/m 2. 1~2 lips of dehisced gin- seng seed had a hill dropping, covered with it 2~3 times thicker than theseeds and then covered with it and fully watered.We concluded that the 72root/m 2could be a proper planting density of the rain shelter house in northern region of Korea.

P-446 Fuctuation in active component biosynthesis in ginseng sprouts according to cultivated period Authors Lee KS1,*, Kim SI1, Seong BJ1, Jee MG1, Lee HC1, Kwon 32723, Ginsenosides levels are higher in leaves than in roots. Therefore, consumers are increasingly interested in using ginsengsprouts.Methods and Results: Ginseng sprouts were cultivated from June tolate July in greenhouse. Ginseng sprouts cultivated during 20, 30, 40,5 0a n d6 0d a y sw a sh a r v e s t e d ,w a s h e da n du s e di nt h ee x p e r i m e n t .Two indicators, namely, 30 kinds of ginsenosides and 8 kinds of pheno-lic acids were monitored by HPLC(detection). Total ginsenoside contentincreased 1.27 times in leaves and d ecreased 0.67 times in roots after 60days.The Rb1, Rb1, Rb2 and Rf of rootswere decreased after 60 days, especially. The total phenolic acid con-t e n t so fl e a v e sd e c r e a s e ds l i g h t l y until 40 days and then increased. The major components of ginsenoside and phenolic acid in leaves were Reand sinapic acid, respectively. Conclusion: From the above results, ginseng sprouts cultivated for 50 days is more e ective ingredient than roots, so it can be said that it is good for con- sumers to use. P-447 Characterization of glycosylated flavonoids obtained from enzymatic reaction by flavonoids exhibit a wide range of biological e ects such as antioxidant activities and therefore represent an interesting eld of research [1]. However, due to their poor solubility in water, glycosylation is generally employed to improve their bioavailability aswell as biochemical and allows formation of -glu- cosylated compounds with high yields [3].The present study therefore focuses on two main aspects, rst the formation of glycosylated flavonoids by enzymatic reactions and secondly their rapid and direct detection by matrix free laser desorption ionization mass spectro-metry (LDI-MS).The polyphenol glucosylation was carried out variants ofBaSP as catalyst. For example, the resveratrol- -glucoside was obtained with high yields using variant Following a SPE pre-puri cation for eli- minating sugars from the reaction medium, all target compounds weredirectly detected from the methanolic wash solution by LDI-MS. Next to thequasi-molecular ions [M-H] -of glycosides also those of their aglycons were systematically observed in the spectra.Overall present results show that LDI-MS, preceding SPE separation, repre- sents a direct and e cient technique for the rapid identi cation of glucosyla- ted and flavonoids originating from reactions.

The purpose of this study was to reduce the period of ginseng re-cultivationin a ginseng house. Growth of 4-years-old ginseng showed the best in steamsterilization method and the lowest incidence of root rot disease. The mostoptimal disinfection method to shorten the re-cultivation period is to look atthe growth until the 6-years-old ginseng. P-450 Correlation analysis between free sugar and organic acid contents during growing period of sprout Ginseng Authors Seong BJ1, Lee KS1, Kim SI1, Jee MG1, Kwon AR1, Kim HH1, Lee HC1,* Institute Geumsan 32723, KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400351 Background: Sprout ginseng is us ed not only for herbs but also for fresh vegetables and salads. Sprout ginseng is characterized by itsshort growth period of about 30~40 days. Even if sprout ginseng isused as a fresh vegetable, research on active ingredients should sup-port the development of sprout ginseng. In this study, the contents offree sugar and organic acid were investigated for the growth period ofsprout ginseng.Methods and Results: On the cultivation of the plastic house, the box was l- led with the substrates, and the seedling ginseng was planted. Free sugarsand organic acid were measured for 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days of growth ofsprout ginseng. The leaves and roots of the sprout ginseng were dried andextracted, and the free sugars and organic acids were analyzed by HPLC.Total sugar content of sprout ginseng was 15.82~16.58% on dry weight. Thecontents of sucrose and glucose were high. Total organic acids content ofginseng were 7.06~9.94% on dry weight. The contents of galacturonic acidand succinic acid were high.Conclusion: The total free sugar and organic acid of spout ginseng showedthe tendency to decrease with the growing period. Sucrose, which was highin free sugars, showed a negative correlation with growth period and glucoseshowed a positive correlation. Galacturonic acid, which was high in organicacid, showed a negative correlation with growth period and succinic acid sho-wed a positive correlation.P-451 Cultivation environment under rain shelter and growth characteristics of 5-year old ginseng Authors An YN1, Han JA1,Y Cho Dosin- Ro 3 sinseo-myeon, Yeoncheon, KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400352 This study is designed to develop the high temperature reduction tech-nology in ginseng 's facility cultivation responding to climate change. Accordingly, the research was focused on the e ect of the covering materials of ginseng 's facility house and the high-temperature reduction treatment on the growth of 5-year old ginseng. For the blocking oflight, the scattering lm, blue-white double-sided lm, and PE lm were installed while for the reduction of high temperature, aluminum screen40%, isoprene and non-treatment were used. The aluminum screen 40%installed inside the facility had the lowest high temperature comparedto other methods during the period of hot temperature. The photosyn-thesis speed in the scattering lm + aluminum screen 40% showed the highest. As for the high temperature 's damage to the ginseng, it was the lowest in case of aluminum screen 40%, followed by the isopreneand non-treatment. As for the growth of the underground part of gin-seng, the weight of root of ginseng cultivated under the scattering lm + aluminum screen 40% and isoprene was the highest. In conclusion, itwas found that when the ginseng is cultivated in the facility house during the period of high temperature, the scattering lm + aluminum screen 40% showed reduced damages to the ginseng but enhances thequantity of ginseng.

As expected, due to the volatility of TTO markers, asubstantial fraction of each TTO component applied on the skin was releasedin the surrounding environment.To the best of the authors 'knowledge, in this work for the rst time 1) a completely solvent-free approach is used to quantify the TTO markersfrom skin layers, and 2) an ad hoc modied static Franz cells is used to quantify the release of TTO components in the surroundingenvironment.

The structural featurewhich combines all these Teleocidin type substances is a 9-memberedlactam ring linked to an indole nucleus[2]. It was reported that alsoLyngbyatoxin, a secondary metabolite of the Hawaiian blue-green algae\"Lyngbya Majuscula \", shows feature[3]. Lyngbyatoxin is for causing seaweed dermatitis to swimmers in Hawaii orOkinawa. Due to the structural similarity Lyngbyatoxin apparently wasalso proved to be a Tumor-promoter[1,4]. We hereby report that \"Strep- tomyces Blastmyceticum \"can be induced to produce a slightly di erent spectrum of metabolites, by an altered cultivation scheme. Bacteriagrowth was performed in a very peptone rich medium for 4-5 days. LC /MS analysis of the culture solution showed presence of Lyngbyatoxinand other Teleocidin species. After centrifugation of the biomass, thesupernatant solution was extracted with Amberlite XAD 1180N for 1 day.The crude extract was further puri ed by open normal phase and HPLC reversed phase chromatography. The LC / MS diagram of the puri ed compound can be seen in the gure below. The exact mass of Lyngbya- toxin was detected with less than 1 ppm error. Other Teleocidin com-pounds such as Olivoretin and Teleocidin B have been isolated in asimilar manner.

As aresult, also the prevalence of age-related diseases will signi cantly increase. The major aim of the MediHealth project is to introduce a novel approach forthe discovery of novel bioactive natural products of food plants from theMediterranean diet and other global sources to promote healthy ageing. Toachieve this aim, a series of plants from the Mediterranean diet and foodplants from Africa, Asia, and South America has been carefully selected andsubjected to in silico, in vitro (advanced cell-based assays), in vivo (flies and mice models) and metabolism analysis. Advanced analytical techniques com-plement the pharmacological evaluation process for the e cient isolation and identi cation of bioactive plant constituents. Furthermore, pharmacolo- gical pro ling of bioactive natural products as well as identi cation and syn- thesis of their metabolites are carried out. Finally, process optimizationstudies are performed to proceed to the development of innovative nutra-ceuticals, dietary supplements or herbal medicinal products [2].The project is based on a well-balanced exchange of researchers between 5universities and 4 companies from European countries as well as 4 universi-ties from non-European countries. It is developed on the needs and interestsof both sectors exploiting the existing complementary expertise. Moreover,knowledge is transferred by training of seconded researchers in environ-ments with di erent research orientation where complimentary skills are required. MediHealth aspires to comprise a successful model promotingresearchers 'competences and long-lasting collaborations between Industry and Academia generating innovation potential at international levels.

Portugal 41, 24071Le\u00f3n, SpainDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400405 Gentian lutea L. var. aurantiaca is an endemic plant growing in the northwes- tern mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. Its roots are mainly used in the ela-boration of liquors and medicinal products due to the high concentration inbitter compounds. Novel medicinal properties described for the sweroside[1] and swertiamarine [2] and the increasing demand, encourage for a stablesource of high quality roots. Fig. 1 Upper picture: Chromatogram of crude Amberlite extract, lower picture: document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The evolution patterns on the content of sweroside and swertiamarine in the roots of cultivated G. lutea var. aurantiaca have been studied. Methanolic ext- racts of complete root systems collected in spring and autumn during threeconsecutive years were analyzed by HPLC, evaluating the e ect of the age and development (weight) of the roots in the content of the cited compounds.The evolution of the content for both compounds was widely di erent. Ana- lyzing the data by a linear regression model, the obtained R-squared (R 2) for the swertiamarin was 0.9549 and 0.6223 for the sweroside. These resultsshow how the evolution in the content of swertiamarin is not dependent onthe age and weight of the roots. On the other hand, sweroside content israndom, but not dependent on the age or the weight.These results suggest that the architecture of the root systems play animportant role in the content of sweroside, since a higher concentration ofthis compound is in the cortex tissues [3]. Further research must be conduc-ted in order to improve the quality of gentian roots. References [1] Ma LQ, Yu Y, Chen H, Li M, Ihsan A, Tong HY et al.

Distribution of secoiridoid glyco- sides in the root system of Photosynthesis according to chlorophyll contents of ginseng Authors Kim SI, Kim HH, Seong BJ, Jee MG1, Lee KS1 Institute 1Ginseng & Medicinal Plant Research Institute, CNARES, Korea DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400406 Ginseng is cultivated mostly in Korea and China. As a medicinal plant, it hastraditionally been used for treating such diseases as hypertension, diabetesmellitus, liver and kidney dysfunction, mental disorders, and skininflammation since long ago. Ginseng can be harvested three years after its cultivation. As a half-shade plant, ginseng is cultivated in a sun-screeningfacility. If the sun-shading material of ginseng has a high light transmissionrate, chlorophyll contents reduce and ginseng withers away; if a low lighttransmission rate, chlorophyll contents increase but a growth amountdecreases. Therefore, this study analyzed photosynthesis of 6-year ginsengaccording to chlorophyll contents. At 20 , when the value of chlorophyll contents was 35, the photosynthesis was the highest, or 3.98 \u00b5mol / m 2s. At 25, when the value of chlorophyll contents was 30, the photosynthesis was high, or 4.38 \u00b5mol / m2s. At 30 , when the value of chlorophyll contents was 25, the photosynthesis was the highest, or 2.89 \u00b5mol / m2s. In terms of quan- tity, a typical sun-shading method had 762 kg / 10area; when the shadingmethod was adjusted in order to make chlorophyll contents suitable to pho-tosynthesis, it had 1,174 kg / 10area. In terms of the useful element 'total ginsenoside ', a typical sun-shading method had 5.7 mg / g; when the sha- ding method was adjusted in order to make chlorophyll contents suitable tophotosynthesis, it had 27.51 mg / g. In conclusion, to increase a quantity ofginseng and total ginsenoside, it is necessary to adjust a sun-shading facilityon the basis of chlorophyll contents.

The need to share the fair and equitable bene ts arising from the utiliza- tion of genetic / biological resources established by the Rio Convention (1992)was rea rmed by the Nagoya Protocol (2010) [1] which entered into force internationally on 12 thOctober 2014. In this framework national access laws and the European regulation EU N\u00b0511 / 20142 have been implemented andenforced[2]. They must be clearly understood by researchers and fully integra-ted into working practices.The practical processes for legally accessing our biodiversity samples fromsource countries[3] are crucial points. The temporal and geographical scopesand the nature of utilization (R&D, commercial use ...) must be clearly de - ned as they determine the legal framework. Prior Informed Consent (PIC),Mutually Agreed Term (MAT) contracts, administrative formalities and obliga-tions must be undertaken. The \"ABCD \"main issues of the Nagoya Protocol implementation are Access, Bene t sharing, Compliance and Due Diligence Declarations.Clear understanding and respect of the regulations should be achieved in theinterest of all stakeholders: source countries, local populations, academicresearchers, industries, patients and customers of biodiversity derived products.

The seed material was harvestedin the eld of Department of Herbal Crop Research, Rural Development Administration, Korea in 2017. 2 pieces of lter paper were placed in 9 cm Petri dish with 5 mL of sterilized water, and the seeds were put on the lter papers and irradiated at 375 nm for 2 days in a 25 incubator. The fungi formed on the seeds were isolated and grown on PDA medium, and the mostvigor area of mycelial growth was cut and stored at -70 . 10 kinds of seed disinfectants such as tebuconazole, which is registered for domestic cultiva-tion disinfectant, and NaOCl 1 %, 4 % (v / v) solution were used. The controlvalue (%) was calculated as e cacy e ect whilst germination rate (%) was cal- culated as harm e ect. As a result, the treatments recognized as excellent in ecacy was tebuconazole, flumizole, prochloraz, hymexazol+metalaxyl-M and ipconazole was recognized that the harm e ect is low so that germina- tion rate is statistically higher or equal to that of the non-treated. Thus,prochloraz and hymexazol+metalaxyl-M, which have passed both the e cacy eect and harm e ect, were selected as seed disinfectant of Angelica acuti- loba Kitagawa and further in-vivo experiment will be conducted.P-468 Abstract see SL YRW-11 Abstract see on page 1399 P-469 Simultaneous determination of malondialdehyde, glutathione, and glutathione disulde in WT1, Cho HK1, Lee HR1, Lim HB*1 Institute 1Department of Industrial Plant Science & Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400411 To evaluate the after treatment with an oxidizing agent and a medicinal plant extract are deter-mined. Quanti cation is generally carried out with bio-assay kits and high-per- formance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As the compounds are measuredindividually, the procedure becomes ti me-consuming and expensive, which pose a disadvantage. Here, our aim was to establish a method to simultaneouslydetermine GSH, GSSG, and MDA reproducibility was to be less than7.26 %. Instrumental analysis methods veri ed by ICH guidelines demonstra- ted excellent linearity and sensitive detection limits. tert-Butyl hydroperoxidetreatment was applied to induce oxidative stress because an increase in MDAand GSSG levels and decrease in GSH levels were assumed to be due to oxida-tive stress. GSH and GSSG exhibited signi cant changes with respect to the oxidative stress levels; however, MDA levels remained unchanged.We simultaneously analyzed in cellular MDA, GSH, and GSSG levels in A549 cells. This study is the rst attempt of this fast, time-saving, and economical method. In future, to evaluate medicinal plant antioxidant e ect(s), it would be used in vitro.

Its rhizomes are widely used for food or traditional medicine in raw,dried or steamed state depending on their purpose. This study was per-formed to compare physicochemical properties of 3 types of RG. Forthis study, the korean domestic cultivar 'Dagang 'was used. To prepare the 3 types of RG, drying and steaming process were conducted. Fordried root, raw root was dried at 60 in hot air dryer for 48hours. For steamed root, dried root was steamed and dried repeatedly for 9 times.As a result, the color value of lightness was highest in raw root andlowest in steamed root. Each value was document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. redness and yellowness was lowest in steamed root. Dried root has the highest value in hardness but lowest in adhesiveness. The content ofcatalpol was highest in dried root and the next was in raw root. Eachvalue was 29.47 mg / g and 27.57 mg / g. It didn 't detect in steamed root. The aucubin content was highest in steamed root. The value was0.95 mg / g. A value of 0.55 mg / g of aucubin was in dried root and0.46 mg / g in raw root. The results show that physicochemical proper-ties of RG was signi cantly di erent depending on the types of RG. It may work di erently in drug and using proper types of RG would be important factor. Therefore, further study on pharmacological activitiesrelated these properties is needed. P-471 The stability of medicinal plant microRNAs in herb preparation process Authors Xie W, Melzig MF Institute 1Institute of Pharmacy, Freie Universitaet Berlin, Koenigin-Luise-Str. 2+4, 14195 Berlin, GermanyDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400413 Herbal medicine is now globally accepted as a valid alternative system ofpharmaceutical therapies. Various studies around the world have been initia-ted to develop scienti c evidence-based herbal therapies. Recently, microR- NAs (miRNAs) have been indicated as new bioactive ingredients in medicinalplants [1]. However, the stability of miRNAs during herbal preparation pro-cess remains unclear. This study evaluated the stability of mistletoe miRNAsin dierent mistletoe preparations. Fresh mistletoe leaves and prepacked dried leaves were powdered, extracted at room temperature, 80 \u00b0C or 100 \u00b0Cwith or without mechanical treatment, to mimic the clinical medicinal use aswell as folk medicinal use of mistletoe. The total RNA was isolated from theseextracts and the miRNAs including miR166a-3 p, miR159a, by stem-loop qRT-PCR. As a result, the miRNAs showed the highest level in fresh plants. A signi cant decrease of miRNAs was observed in the extracts made from fresh plants, and mechani-cal treatment increased miRNA damage. Unexpectedly, a relatively high num-ber of tested miRNAs were found in prepackaged dried mistletoe plants,indicating that these miRNAs could survive air-drying and storage process.Only miR166a-3 p and miR159a with relatively low levels were determined inthe mimicked mistletoe tea preparation (soak dried mistletoe in hot waterfor 10 min). The Ct values of tested miRNAs in mistletoe decoction (boiled inwater for 30 min) were below the limit of detection. These data suggestedthat the miRNA could survive some preparation process, and indicated ourconsumption that medicinal plants preparations might introduce miRNAsinto mammals [2].

As it could be expected, this major discovery has stimulated both considerable excitement and controversyabout its natural origin. In 2014, the presence of tramadol in the roots of theplant was suggested to be an anthropogenic contamination due to ethno-veterinary practices [2]. Clearly, further investigations are required in orderto decipher the Tramadol origin. Hence, we have investigated 13 Nauclea lati- folia roots collected at di erent areas of the national B\u00e9nou\u00e9 park in Came- roon (designated by the UNESCO as a Biosphere reserve). HRMS analysesshowed the occurrence of tramadol in all methanolic extracts of Nauclea lati- folia. The new tramadol-targeted isolation procedure was carried out by semi-preparative HPLC with dry-load injection of the sample and the struc-ture was con rmed by 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopic methods. Highly pure tramadol was isolated and is being analyzed by the 14C accelerator mass spectrometry in order to determine the radiocarbon content in the tramadolisolated from Nauclea latifolia versus synthetic Tramadol. Indeed, natural pro- ducts, recently biosynthesized should contain radiocarbon and syntheticcompounds (petroleum derived molecules) should not contain 14C as the lat- ter is decayed.

CMR has beenused to treat diseases such as cough, headache, edema and diabetes. The anti-viral e ect of CMR on in fluenza virus had not been reported until now. In this study, we demonstrate the anti-in fluenza viral activity of CMR water extract Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. Pretreat-ment of WCMR reduced viral replication in a dose-dependent manner, asevaluated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged in fluenza virus in the cells. Consistently, we found that the expressions of viral proteinswere decreased in the presence of WCMR, compared with no treatment,through immunoblot analysis and immuno fluorescence. To investigate the underlying mechanism on antiviral e cacy of WCMR, we checked whether WCMR could a ect the type I IFN production and proin flamma- tory cytokine activation. WCMR remarkably activated STAT-1 4 and 24 h post-treatment, dose-dependently. Furthermore, thepretreatment of WCMR increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK andJNK in the cells. These result implies WCMR induced the production oftype I IFN including pro-in flammatory cytokines and subsequent stimula- of the cells.In conclusion, the pretreatment of WCMR suppresses viral replication and viral gene expression via type I IFN activation and proin flammatory cytokine such as STAT-1, TBK, and induction of antiviral state, inmurine Raw 264.7 macrophage cells.

P-476 dose fermented Platycodon grandi florus powder in Sprague-Dawley Noh JH, Seok P, Jang M, Gu EY, Lee BS, Kim YB, Han KH florus,c a l l e db a l l o o n flower, is a species of herbaceous flo- wering perennial plant of the family Campanulaceae and inhabits East Asia (Korea, China, Japan and the Russian Far East). The traditional use of balloonflower root is to promote healthy lung function, to remove phlegm from the lungs, and to treat diarrhea and other in flammatory diseases in Korea [1]. We intend to develop a health functional food of fermented Platycodon grandi florus powder, which helps improve the condition of the skin caused by immune overreaction. The fermentation-derived bioactive substance isexpected to reduce itching by suppressing the secretion of in flammation mediators in mast cells [2] and to induce Th1 immunity by suppressing theTh2 immune overreaction [3]. However it 's not known whether the exces- sive intake of the fermented powder causes toxic e ects. The present study was carried out to evaluate the acute toxicity of the fermented Platycodon grandi florus powder following single oral administration to Sprague-Dawley rats and beagle dogs. Rats and dogs were administered single dose at doselevels of 0, 750, 1500 and 3000 mg / kg by oral gavage or capsule. In the ratand dog studies, there were no abnormal changes in mortality, clinical sign,body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry and mac-roscopic nding following administration. Based on these results, the maxi- mum tolerated dose (MTD) was co nsidered over 3000 mg / kg under this study condition. Also, we suggest a dose level of 3000 mg / kg be recom- mended as a high dose in repeat toxicity studies for the acceptable dailyintake (ADI). References [1] Elijah N, Jong-Hoon J, Nam-Keun L, J.

Thisstudy was undertaken to verify the e ect of peanut sprout extract (PNS_E) on the inhibition of allergic and anaphylac tic responses using a peanut (PN)-immu- nized food allergy mouse model. Fresh peanut sprout, which was germinated for0, 3, 5, and 7 days with mature peanut. Mice were sensitized to cholera toxinplus PN or PNS_E by intragastric administration on days 0, 7, and then only PNor PNS_E challenged on day 21, 35. Five weeks later, we compared the mucosalmast cell degranulation, ear swelling and systemic anaphylaxis that were stimu-lated with PN extract, compared to PNS_E. Subsequently, Ara h1, a biomarker ofPN allergy, levels in serum and ytokine production natants of splenocytes of the Ara h1 mucosal mast cell degranulation, the degree of systemic anaphylaxis and ear swelling,and a higher level of production of IFN- and IL-10 cytokines, and reduced sec- retion of IL-4 that are related to the Th2 immune response in the PN-immunized food allergy mouse model. The results of this study show that the allergenicity of PN extracts could be reduced by germinated for 3, 5, and 7 days which cau-sed downregulation of Th2 lymphocyte activity, systemic swelling in the PN-sensitized mice. P-479 Characterization of a standardized extract of of our research and industrial expertise is focused on the produc- tion of plant extracts with a phytochemical pro le similar to that of theplant totum ,w h i c hi sd e ned as all the active compounds present in the part of the plant used for extraction, and on which the fundamentalprinciples of additivity and synergy are based. The objective of thisstudy was to determine the phytochemical composition of a hydroetha-nolic extract of fresh Curcuma Longa rhizomes, made according to the patented process Phytostandard \u00ae(standardized extract marketed under the name EPS Curcuma, PiLeJe Laboratoire, France), per comparison withthe native plant.The phytochemical composition of the extract was determined in HPTLC,HPLC, LC / MS, MS / MS and NMR experiments. The phytochemical pro le of the extract was similar to that of the native plant. We identi ed 16 com- pounds including phenolic compounds, curcuminoids, amino acids, polysac-charides and terpenoids. NMR experiments puri identi cation of -tumerone, -tumerone and arturmerone, three compounds known to be present in the essential oil. By combiningseveral analytical methods we identi ed precisely di erent compounds pre- sent in the extract and showed that the patented extraction process usedallows to obtain an extract of fresh Curcuma Longa rhizomes in which the majority of metabolites found in the native plant are preserved and thereforewith a composition close to the totum .

Due to the hormonal decline in postmenopausal women, the incidence of bone mass loss increases,together with mammary gland atrophy, mouth and e ects of genistein in ovariectomized female rats. Forty female rats were divided into 4 groups (10 rats / group): group I: treatedwith 10 mg / kg/day 8 weeks; group II:treated with 17 -estradiol for 8 weeks with 10 \u00b5g / kg/day; the group III: untreated rats and group IV: non-ovariectomized and untreated rats.Bone samples were taken from the femoral and lumbar head, mammarygland, vaginal and buccal mucosa and were histologically analyzed. Thebone density evaluation was made by radiological method. All the expe-riments and research protocols were approved by the Research EthicsComitee.Results: In group III the imaging results show a slight bone demineralizationat the level of the femoral head compared to the other groups. Bone histolo-gical analysis con rms bone loss in group III and in group I the bone density is lower than in groups II and IV. Regarding the mammary gland and vaginalmucosa, substitution treatment genistein prevents oral mucosal atrophy vaginal and mammary gland atrophy.The e ects of genistein bone density cial and the reduced eects on the mammary gland and vaginal mucosa make it useful in long- term treatment in postmenopausal women.

P-481 Iminosugars from Baphia pubescens Hook (Fabaceae) as a potential source of antidiabetic phytopharmaceuticals Authors Michalik A1, Winters A1, Stephens K2, Nash R3 Institute 1Aberystwyth University, Institute of Biological, Environmental & Rural Sciences, Aberystwyth, United Kingdom; 2BioExtractions (Wales) Ltd., Tredegar, DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400422 Baphia pubescens Hook (Fabaceae) is a shrub or small tree found in the tropical regions of Africa. Locally, the leaves and seedpods of Baphia species are used as a vegetable or spice and also for treating various ailments includinginflammation, pain and diarrhoea [1], but ethnobotanical literature does not list these plants amongst those traditionally used for the treatment andmanagement of diabetes.Previous phytochemical investigation has shown that plants belonging to thisgenus of legumes are rich in iminosugars. These compounds closelyresemble sugars structurally and mimic them along metabolic pathways. Imi-nosugars often show digestive enzyme inhibition and thus have a therapeuticpotential in managing diabetes (by helping to stabilise blood glucoselevels) [2].This research focuses on the isolation and puri cation of iminosugars from Baphia pubescens by ion exchange chromatography and aims to establish whether HPCCC (high performance counter current chromatography) couldoer an alternative method for isolation. An ethanolic extract (50 % vol:vol) of whole seed pods, prepared and fractio-nated using ion exchange resins, yielded several iminosugar compounds andtwo related glycosides. A method of isolation by HPCCC is currently beingdeveloped.As iminosugars previously isolated from Baphia References al. Compositional studies of Baphia pubescens (Urohun) leaves.

Ltd., Anand, Gujarat, India DOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400425 Ellagic acid (EA)is a very common plant phenolic with occurrence in bark,stem, fruit or wood part in many plants. It occurs in nature either in a freeor complex form like ellagitannins which further gets hydrolyzed in thebody into EA and metabolized in to urolithins and its glucuronide. In thisway, EA entered dietary supplement (DS) industry worldwide from lastdecade with diverse claims like antioxidant, immunity booster and digestivehealth.The regulations for the DS globally have common requirement \"authentica- tion of botanical source as per label claim \". EA has been introduced in the DS industry from a potential source i. e. Punica granatum (PG). PG is a tropical fruit with biochemical markers as punicalagin A & B, punicalin A-B, gallic EA. PG contains gallotannins-ellagitannins on hydrolysis convert to EA.The current di erent methods have inability to con rm the sourcing of raw material from which EA have manufactured and varied solubility of EA in dif-ferent solvents while analysis. Therefore, this research update solving thisproblem with optimization and validation of a simple, stable matrix-basedsample preparation method created on UFLC-UV-PDA.This method adapted for investigating the sourcing of botanical DS of ellagicacid from 10 potential sources other than PG with the help of ESI-MS/MS. Also, a ngerprinting of PG has been separately established for recon rma- tion of its sourcing.This study provides a valuable strategy for rapidly screening and identifyingchemical components of PG and source identi cation of DS.P-486 New Zealand spinach ( tetragonoides ) as a functional food alternative for and anti-hyperuricemia Authors Lee GJ1, Lee YS2, Kim SH3, University, Daejeon 34134, Korea; 2Herbal Medicine Research Institute of Oriental Medicine, 34054, Dajeon Korea; 3Institute 34520, KoreaDOI 10.1055/s-0039-3400426 Obesity is a serious public health problem, associated with the developmentof metabolic disorders. New Zealand spinach (NZS) growing around theKorean peninsula has been used, but no report is available on its antiobesityeects and mechanisms. Here, we examined the anti-obesity and anti-hyper- uricemic e ects of NZS in high-fat diet (HFD) obese mice. NZS extract was prepared with 70 % ethanol under re flux in a condensation system at 85 C for 3 h. Mice were fed the normal fat diet (NFD); high-fat diet (HFD); HFD with 75, 150, or 300 mg / kg NZS extract; or245 mg / kg Garcinia cambogia (GC) as a reference. Compared to HFD, NZSextracts decreased body weight gain, total white adipose tissue (WAT), andliver weight by the max. 58 %, 64 %, 75 %, respectively, and improved hepaticand plasma lipid pro les, which appeared to be related to the reduced adipo- genesis genes including aP2 / FABP4. With NZS, the plasma levels of the lep-tin and uric acid were signi cantly decreased while the adiponectin levels were increased. Furthermore, NZS decreased the expression levels of adipo-genesis-related genes and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which is involvedin uric acid production, while increasing that of proteins associated with fattyacid oxidation. The dose treatment of 300 mg / kg used here would be com-parable with about 1500 mg / day in a 60-kg human, which implies that theeect of NZS may be expected for antiobesity. Results NZS exerts anti-obesity, anti-hyperlipidemia, and anti-hyperuricemic e ects by regulation of lipid metabolism-related genes and proteins, and decreasedexpression of XOR.

Female Wistar rats were fed normal rat chow and tap water with (Diabetesgroup) or without diabetes induction by intraperitonial streptozotocininjection (50 mg / kg of body weight) (Control group) before pregnancy.Then, they were supplemented with 3 % taurine in water (Control+T andDiabetes+T groups) or water alone from conception to weaning. Afterweaning, male o spring were fed normal rat chow and water throug- hout the study. At 16 weeks of age, fasting blood sugar (FBS), oral glu-cose tolerance test (OGTT), plasma insulin level, insulin resistance, andblood lipid pro les were measured. Body weight, total cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and insulin resistance (esti-mated by HOMA-IR) were not signi cantly di erent among the four groups.

There are many ca eine-containing dietary supplements that are used as energizing or lipolytic (weight loss)supplements [1,2]. The term \"dietary supplement \"often misleads the consumer, assuming that the active principles are of vegetal origin.Thepurpose of the study was to compare the ca eine concentration decla- red by the manufacturer with that actually present in the dietary supple-ments containing green tea or guarana extract [3]. Therefore, 5 dietarysupplements were analyzed by HPLC-UV and the amount of ca eine con- tained in each supplement was compared with the declared one.Results: The 5 dietary supplements had a reported ca eine content of 80 to 160 mg / tablet/capsule, but the actual ca eine content determi- ned by HPLC exceeded the one declared by the manufacturer by 30-60 %. The highest di erences were found in preparations also containing guarana or green tea extract with known ca eine content. If di erent plant extracts containing the same active substance are combined, themanufacturer should declare the total cumulative dose of the activeprinciple in order to avoid side e ects or even some pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions between the dietary supplement and apossible chronic medication.

We compared the expres-sion of mentioned transporters in Caco-2 cells at di erent time points within 3 weeks untreated and treated with di erentiation reagent Sodium Butyrate. After western blot analysis, the samples were detec-ted by chemiluminescence and we were able to detect the expressionof SGLT1, FATP2 and FATP4. Cells treated with Sodium Butyrate showedan approximate expression of each of the transporters earlier afterconfluence compared to untreated cells at Day 15 or 21 afterconfluence. Sodium Butyrate is suitable to shorten the di erentiation time and still represents the approximate expression of these transpor-ters in the di erentiated stage.
