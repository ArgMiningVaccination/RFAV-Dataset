MCIR is an immuni zation registry that compiles complete immunization histories for children and adults in Michigan. Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems that comply with Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements must be able to subm it immunization administration data to their state registry. This document explains the technical details of this interface. The recommendations here are in line with CDC and HL7 standards and should be compatib le with EHR's who are fo llowing Meaningful Use guidelines.

Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 4 of 60 Michigan Care Improvement Registry Introduction and History MCIR was created in 1998 to collect reliable immunization information and make it accessible to authorized users online. In 2006, MCIR was expanded to include ad ults. By state law, providers are required to submit childhood immunizations within 72 hours of administra tion. In addition, providers are allowed and highly encouraged to report adult vaccinations. MCIR benefits health care organizations, schools, li censed childcare programs, and Michigan's citizens by consolidating immunization information from multiple providers. This reduces vaccine-preventable diseases, over-vaccination, and allows providers to see up-to-date patient immunization history. MCIR also has the ability to assist with pandemic flu preparedness and can track vaccines and medications during a public health emergency. Transfer Interfaces Available This document primarily describes the interface for accepting reports of administered and historical vaccinations via a VXU real-time or ba tch update. This is the first HL7 interface that MCIR has developed. Query and other bidirectional interface options will be developed soon and will be documented in an updated version of this document. How to Format Data MCIR currently supports the following versions of HL7 formatted messages: HL7 v2.5.1 Preferred format. HL7 v2.3.1 Supported format Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 5 of 60 How to Send Data As HL7 specifically avoided defining how messages should be transported, there is no definitive national standard for doing so. MCIR requires connectivity through a Qualified Organization/Sub-State Health Information Exchange. Click on this link for a list of Qualified Organizations: visit http://mihin.org/exchanges/ Please contact the MCIR Help Desk 1-888-243-6652 option 3 or via E-mail MU_mcirhelp@mphi.org for questions about information on how to establish an interface account. Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 6 of 60 Health Information Exchanges (HIE) and MCIR HL7 Messaging Requirements Effective May 1, 2013 The Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR) is buil t to identify issues in incoming data and reject messages that do not meet minimum standards. Health Information Exchanges or Intermediaries should evaluate the message header for required fields before submission to the State. For example, if the MSH-4 does not contain a valid HL7 Facility ID that was issued by MCIR, then this is an Error. This means that a message with a missing HL7 Facility ID would be rejected . MSH Field Field Name Requirements MSH-4 Sending Facility Must be populated, should be in the format of '####-##-## ' MSH-5 Receiving Application Must be populated with ' MCIR ' MSH-6 Receiving Facility Must be populated with ' MDCH ' MSH-12 Version ID Must be populated with a valid HL7 version, current supported versions are 2.3.1 , 2.5.1 Health Information Exchanges or Intermediaries will receive ACK messages from MCIR and should return these messages back to the provider site that submitted them to MCIR. This will become a mandatory function on October 1, 2013. In cases where returning the ACK to the original sender site would cause undue harm, this requirement can be waved on a case by case basis. If there are any other errors anyw here, especially in the RXA segmen t, then the message is rejected and MCIR will respond with an ACK error message. The MSA- 1 field will be set to \"AE\" to indicate that there were errors and details of those errors will be re ported in the ERR segment in accordance with HL7 standards. Examples of issues that may cause a message to be rejected include: Message violates HL7 2.3.1 or HL7 2.5.1 standards. Message is missing field required by MCIR. Value is not valid for the given type (e.g. there is an alphanumeric data value in a date field) or is not a recognized valid value. Value is inconsistent with other values given in the same message. Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 7 of 60 MCIR has developed a list of all known or potential issues that may be iden tified in an incoming message and has assigned them one of the four following states: Error - entire message should be rejected. Warning - message may be accepted but with a comment. Accept - message may be accepted. Skip - message, segment, or associated concept should not be processed but no error needs to be generated (rarely used by MCIR). Warnings If there are any warnings in the VXU me ssage, such as an invalid data type in an optional field or an invalid data code value in an optional field, MCIR will note th ese issues on data quality reports but will still process the message. The warnings will not cause MCIR to re ject the message. However, those warnings will be reported in both the ERR segment and the MSA-3 field of MCIR's response message in order to facilitate the HL7 data exchange partner's inte gration testing of their system to promote data quality. Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 8 of 60 Health Level Seven (HL7) History HL7 was first formed as a standard in the late 1980's as a collaboration between vendors of health systems and hospitals. The goal was to create a standard message format that disparate systems could use to exchange health data. The name of HL7 was settled on beca use HL7 was originally conceived to define message structures in the seventh level of the ideal model of networks. At that time, the Internet was not widespread and there was quite a lot of variation in hospital networks. It wa s decided that HL7 would only define messages and not how these messages were sent. Within a year HL7 version 2 was releas ed. This version has been in use for over 20 years. HL7 version 3 is a new standards track with major improvements over version 2. It is not fully completed. MCIR is currently using HL7 Version 2.5.1 messages. Message Specifications There are three controlling documents that define how the MCIR interface works. They are arranged in a hierarchy of documents, each refining and constraining the standard: The first is the HL7 2.5.1 standard, which was develo ped by Health Level Seven, a not-for-profit ANSI- accredited standards developing organization. This standard defines the structure and content of immunization messages but leaves many spec ific implementation details undecided. The second document is the CDC's Implementation Guide for Immunization Messaging. This guide gives specific instructions regarding how to report to immuni zation registries, but still leaves some implementation decisions to each state registry. This guide, and ot her technical information can be found at this CDC website: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/stds/standards.htm Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 9 of 60 What you are reading now is the third document. It fina lizes all implementation decisions and defines exactly what MCIR will and will not accept. It is written in accordance with the standards set in the first two documents. Each of these standards should be consulted when developing an interface with MCIR. Message Structure \u00d3 HL7 messages are made of multiple lines called segments . Each line/segment is separated by a carriage return. Note Windows systems separate lines by carriag e returns + line feeds, so some Windows applications will not correctly display HL7 messa ges. Windows Notepad will display HL7 messages as one long continuous line. This is very hard to read. It is better to view an HL7 message in WordPad or some other text editor. \u00d3 Each segment starts with a three letter name that identifies the segment. \u00d3 Each segment is broken into fields that are normally separated by vertical bars |. \u00d3 Each field can also be broken into sub-fields by a caret ^. \u00d3 Separators are only sent to keep fields in their correct position. (For example: field1|||field4) Separators at the end of segments and fields are omitted if all the values there are empty. \u00d3 Some fields within a segment can also repeat. Repeating fields are separated by a tilde ~. For more information about HL7 formatting please re ad the CDC and HL7 guides which can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/stds/standards.htm Version Compatibility HL7 is built to be backwards compatib le with older versions. New fields that are introduced should be ignored by older versions and older messages should still proce ss correctly in new systems. The version number in HL7 version 2 messages indicates the st andards release that the message is associated with. A system built using the HL7 v2.5.1 should still be able to accept 2.3 messa ges, although it may not support improvements made in v2.5.1. MCIR currently support the current CDC Immunization Guide version 2.5.1 messages and the CDC Immunization Guide version 2.3.1 messages. Meaningful Use MCIR is ready to receive submissions for sites who are looking to attest for meaningful use in regards to submitting immunization messages. For more information please visit http://www.mcir.org/MeaningfulUse/ . Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 10 of 60 Immunization Messages Vaccination Update (VXU) Unsolicited Vaccination Update (VXU) messages are th e preferred method for MCIR to receive and send vaccination information. The VXU is based off a pharmacy message and ca n indicate a patient's demographics and zero or more vacci nations. VXU messages may also be us ed to register a patient who does not have vaccinations yet, by simply sending a VXU without any vaccinations. Vaccination Query A Vaccination Query is used to query or pull a patient record from another system. These type of messages will be supported in the future. Patient Update (ADT) Admission/Discharge/Transfer (ADT) messages were the first messages created in HL7 and are one of the most ubiquitous messages used. They are used to in dicate basic demographic information about a patient and don't usually indicate deta iled medical information. ADT messages are used to register patients. MCIR woul d prefer patient registrations using a VXU, but will accept them via an ADT in order to supp ort local processes currently in place. MCIR does not provide a specification for ADT messages, as it prefers VXU messages. How to Read This Document This document is written to be easy to read and implement. The finer de tails and explanations of HL7 have been glossed over and simplified. This guide is not a co mplete elaboration of HL7 rather it is a straight- forward how-to guide. To see this original information please review the HL7 standard and the CDC guide. Each field and subfield in the message has a status. Th is status indicates what MCIR expects from a sending system. This status is descriptive and does not necessarily match the HL7 standard. A few important points about these status messages: Required means that the sending system is required to send it, if available. The sending system should never send filler or \"dummy\" data in required fields. If there is no value in a required field, because it was not entered or be cause there is no value known, then empty should still be sent. Some required fields cannot be left empty or the message will be rejected. These are clearly indicated in the notes. Highly recommended means that ideally the information should always be sent, but it is recognized that in some cases the info rmation is simply not available. Optional means that MCIR may read or use the information but does not require it to be sent. Nevertheless, some optional fields are necessary to support MCIR functions and reports and should be sent. Please send values for option al fields if they are available. Ignored means that MCIR currently does not read from this field. The sender may leave it blank or send any kind of value. MCIR will not check it for conformance to any specification. Fields that are ignored may be used by MCIR in the future. MCIR recommends that all ignored fields conform to the CDC guide for future interoperability. Code values also have their own st atus. These are slightly different: Accepted means that MCIR recognizes the value and will read it. Ignored means that MCIR does not use this value and will act as if no value was sent. Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 11 of 60 Not accepted means that MCIR cannot accept the valu e and will generate some kind of error condition. Part or the entire message may be rejected. In addition, code values listed in this guide represent a ll code values MCIR expects to receive. In some tables HL7 defines a larger set of permissibl e or expected values. These are not listed in this guide for brevity or clarity. In most cases MCIR does not expect to receive these codes and may reject messages with invalid or unrecognized codes. However, invalid or unrecognized codes in non-critical fields are normally ignored and the rest of message is processed normally. In summary, the status messages are meant as a ge neral guide. Please read the notes for further explanation. Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 12 of 60 Vaccination Update Message (VXU) Message Structure Segment Description Status MSH Message Header required PID Patient Identification required [PD1] Additional Demographics optional [{NK1}] Next of Kin/Associated Parties Required for patients up through 18 years of age [PV1 Patient Visit ignored [PV2]] Patient Visit Additional Information ignored [{IN1 Insurance ignored [IN2] Insurance Additional Information ignored [IN3] Insurance Additional information-Cert ignored }] [{[ORC] Common Order highly recommended RXA Pharmacy Administration required [RXR] Pharmacy Route highly recommended [{OBX Observation/Result required where RXA-9 equals \"00\" [{NTE}] Notes (Regarding Immunization) ignored }] }] Each message must begin with a Message Header (MSH) segment. Th e MSH indicates the start of the message and gives meta data abou t the message, including message ty pe, sender and other important message information. Each message contains one Patient Identification (PID) se gment. Only one patient at a time may be sent in a message. This segments gives identifying detail about the pa tient and is used to find matching patients in the registry. The Additional Demographics (PD1) segment is used to indicate reminder/recall participation. The Next of Kin/Associated Parties (NK1) mu st be sent at least once to identify the responsible party for patients under the age of 18. The Pharmacy Administration (RXA) se gment indicates that a single vaccin ation was given. Zero or more of these may be sent for each patient. Some systems se nd only one vaccination in a message (thus multiple message are sent for a single patient), while othe rs aggregate all received immunizations under one message. Either method is acceptab le. The Pharmacy Route (RXR) segmen t should also be included to indicate where and how the va ccination was given. Example Message The example message below may be used as a template to create a test message. Here are the steps to create a test message: Michigan Care Improvement Registry HL7 2.5.1 Specification for Vaccination Messages Revised August 23, 2013 Page 13 of 60 1. Copy the example message to your favo rite text editor, such as Notepad. 2. Replace the example data with your preferred exam ple data. The parts with lighter shading are the parts that are changeable. 3. Remove the extra line breaks so that each segment is on a single line. Remove the extra spaces that were used to make the message more readable. 4. The message is now ready to submit to MCIR. This example message may also be used as a templa te for development of a new HL7 interface. Note: Although most fields supported by MCIR are shown here , some of the ones less likely to be used are not shown. Please review the standa rd for that segments are separa ted by carriage returns <cr> but Windows automatically separates lines by carriage returns <cr> + line feeds <lf>. MCIR prefers the HL7 standard separator but will accept the Windows ones as well. MCIR recommends using the proper HL7 separators when developing an ne w HL7 interface to any registry. Master Field List The Master Field List shows every field accepted by MC IR in one correlated table. For more details on each field please see the documentation under the segment an d field description. A few pointers on how to read this table: \u00d3 The field status is quick summary of the details co ntained further in the document. Use this table as a quick rule-of-thumb but read the expanded notes for more information. \u00d3 The column labeled PI indicates that this information is used in Patient Identification. It is important that enough information is sent in order to identi fy and match the patient with records currently in MCIR. Please send all fields marked PI, if available.

If more than one id is sent then each must be differentiated by the identi fier type code in PID-3.5. MCIR will also accept the MCIR id, Medicaid number, and WIC number in this field. If more than one id is sent, MCIR will look for ids identified as such: Patient Id Description PID-3.5 Patient id Also known as Medical Record Number (MRN), patient id, chart number, etc. MR, or PT, or PI MCIR id Unique id assigned by MCIR (not normally sent) SR Medicaid number Number assigned by Medicaid. Should be sent if known. MA WIC number Number assigned by WIC program. Should be sent if known. WC Patient ids may be sent in any order. Other patient ids not listed here may also be sent but will be ignored. It is important that the sending syst em's patient id be unique in the sending system. This number should not be reused for different patients. It is not ideal, but okay for one patient to have more than one patient id (e.g. when there is a duplicate patien t record.) The patient id does not have to be unique outside of this sending system. For example, two different submitters ca n send patients in with the same patient id, as a random coincidence, and MCIR will keep them separa te because they are from different systems. PID-5: Patient name The legal name must be sent in the first repetition. The last, firs t and middle names must be alpha characters only (A-Z).The last name or the first name should not contain the patien t's suffix (e.g. JR or III).

In most cases this will not be known and this field should be le ft blank. If known, this may be used by MCIR to associate this information with the correct immunization. ORC-3: Filler Order Number This field indicates the sending system's id for this va ccination. Every vaccination even should be assigned a id unique to the sending system. In this way, if an update is made to the vaccination, the receiving side (MCIR) can determine whic h vaccination to update. In the past the only way to dete rmine which vaccination to update was to match on vaccination code (CVX/CPT) and vaccination date. If one of these valu es changed it was often impossible to determine the original vaccination and it had to be added. That pr ocess led to incorrect data being added to patient records. For example: if a nurse entered an MMR given on 01/06/2009 and sent it to MCIR, and later realized that it really was given 01/06/2010 and correct it, his system may send it again but MCIR has no way of knowing that this change refers to original report. If both reports shar e the same vaccination id then the incorrect dose can be updated. RXA: Pharmacy Administration Segment The Pharmacy Administration (RXA) segment is requir ed to indicate which vaccinations are given. This segment is required if there are vacci nations to report.

Any time information is ignored, and need not be sent. It is import ant that this date be the actual da te the vaccination was given and not the date that it was recorded or billed. Note The entire message will be rejected if a va ccination is recorded in the future, after the message was created, after the indicated death da te, or before the patient's date of birth.

CDC offers an email service that se nds updates when new CVX codes are added. Information about this service is available on the websites listed above. It is critical to keep code sets in up-to-date in order to appropriate report vaccinations. Step s should be taken to ensure that someone is receiving these emails and keeping the code sets up-to-date. RXA-6: Administered amount The amount of vaccine that was given. This should be expressed in milliliters (ML). The amount should be placed here and the units in RXA-7. Do not put the units in this field.

Normally a vaccination is CP for Complete. But if the vaccination was refused by the pa tient, or was wasted, or was partially administered, this can be indicated here. Position Field Status 1 id highly recommended Table 0322 - Substance refusal reason Value Description Status CP Complete Accepted RE Refused Accepted NA Not Administered Accepted PA Partially Administered Accepted RXA-21: Action code Action to take with vaccination information. This field is not required. If it is not sent then Add is assumed. An update status has the same effect as Add. MCIR determines for each vaccin ation whether to add or update based on what is currently in the registry. Here is an example of how an immunization record that is reported incorrectly can be updated appropriately. First, the incorrect encounter information is sent with an \"A\" (Add). Next, after the mistake is corrected locally the pr eviously submitted incorrect encounter information is sent with a \"D\" (Delete). Finally, the correct encounter information is sent with an \"A\" (Add). This order (A-D-A) will insure the correct informatio n is recorded and will support properly inventory functions in MCIR. There are few important pointers about sending adds and deletes: Some submitting systems are capable of sending Adds and Deletes to detail the history of edits on a single immunization record. MCIR prefers to receive the latest corrected record, and would rather not see the entire edit history. MCIR assumes the last update for a dd or delete is the final decision on whether an immunization is part of the record or not. Sending Add then Dele te on the record will result in the record being removed from the patient's immunization history. When sending both adds and deletes, order ma tters. Add and then delete will result in no immunization history added, and D-A will result in it being added. The su bmitting system must ensure that it is sending th ese in the correct order. MCIR recommends, as best practice, to always us e the A-D-A method listed above in the example to update immunization records.

OBX-2: Value Type Indicates what kind of data will be sent in OBX-5. For Vaccine Inventor y reporting (for example: VFC) use CE. OBX-3: Observation Identifier This indicates what kind of data is being sent in this OBX. One way to look at this is OBX-3 poses the question and OBX-5 answers it. For example, OBX-3 ma y indicate VIS Statement Published Date, which can be read as \"What is the VIS St atement Published Date?\" and the value in OBX-5 is the answer.

OBX-14: Date/Time of the Observation The date/time when the observation was made. What is VFC Status? Vaccines For Children is a federally funded program that supplies vaccines without charge to primary care providers to administer to groups of children who woul d otherwise not be able to receive vaccinations. This program is critical to ensuring that all children are able to receive vaccinations. Before administering a VFC vaccination the provider is required to determine the VFC status of the patient. This information must be reported in aggregate by the provider on a regular ba sis to the VFC program as part of regular inventory review of usage. MCIR provides support to VFC providers by providing a mechanism to keep track of vaccine inventory and VFC status of each administered vaccination. How to Send VFC Status The original registry standard specified that the VFC st atus be sent at the patient level. This standard had limitations because: \u00d3 While the PV1 indicates information associated wi th a visit, the vaccination message may contain information from previous visits. Simply filling in th e VFC status only indicates that VFC status for the new vaccinations being reported. \u00d3 Additional VFC codes from previous visits may be sent but requires advanced message construction and advanced message processing by the registry. Many submitters and immunization registries do not support a full list of VFC status history. \u00d3 The field applies to all vaccinations given to the pa tient on a visit and cannot be used to indicate which vaccinations the VFC specifica lly applies to. It is possible for a patient to receive both private and VFC supplied vaccines in the same visit. Because of these limitations the immu nization standard is being updated with the recommendation that VFC status be sent at the vaccination leve l as an observation. MCIR is pre-ad opting this recommendation in order to support current VFC and inventory functions. The following information is consistent with national standards and will be adopted nationwide in other registries. Please Note: MCIR receives VFC status at the Vaccination level in an OBX segment. MCIR is not supporting VFC status in PV1-20. VFC Status Codes There are two types of VFC codes that MCIR accepts in the OBX segment: \u00d3 VFC codes defined by the CDC immunization guide that apply to all immunization registries. \u00d3 VFC codes defined by MCIR in accordance with the guidance from the CDC.
