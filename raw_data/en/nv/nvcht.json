With a rapidly aging population, the challenges that neurodegenerative diseases pose forour society will only increase. Decades of research in molecular and cellular biology and neurobiol-ogy have revealed a myriad of poten-tial drug targets to slow or preventthese disorders. In an effort to aggressively trans- late these ndings into effective thera-pies, the School of Medicine hasformed a new interdepartmentalprogram in Cellular Neuroscience, Neurodegeneration and Repair( cnnr ) that will accelerate the pace of Y ale's research on neurodegenera-tive diseases and nerve injury. The co-directors of the new program, Pietro De Camilli, m.d. , Eugene Higgins Professor of CellBiology, and Stephen M.

Now,120years later, Y ale researchers led by Matthew W. State, m.d., ph.d. , Harris Assistant Professor of ChildPsychiatry, have identied the rstgenetic mutation associated withT ourette's syndrome (TS).Along with a Y ale study of dyslexia (story at right), the workwas cited in a list of the top 10sci- entic breakthroughs of 2005 in the December 23issue of the journal Science . The gene, which contributes to neuronal development and com-munication between neurons,accounts for only a small percent-age of cases of T ourette's syndrome,but its discovery after years ofsearching offers the best chance yetto penetrate this socially debilitat-ing condition.

The initiative, led by Leonard E. Munstermann, ph.d. , senior research scientist in epidemiology, has receiveda $ 1.3million Science Education Partnership Award ( sepa ) from the National Institutes of Health( nih ) to stimulate students' interestin science. In the program, to be housed at the Peabody Museum andcoordinated by project managerLaura L. Fawcett, m.s.p.h. , and science education specialist T erriStern, researchers and educators willdesign curricula for grades 5through 10that create a deeper understanding of biological science. \"The curricula will feature Lyme disease and West Nile encephalitisbecause of their public health signi-cance, and because they point tobroader biological relationships,\" saysMunstermann, also curator of ento-mology at the Peabody. Students willexplore tick and mosquito life cyclesusing preserved ticks and the skins and skulls of mammal and bird hostsfor Lyme disease and West Nile virus.In springtime, students will captureand examine mosquito larvae fromvernal pools. The project is expected to reach 11,400 students by 2010 . \"By giving students the chance to participate inhands-on, inquiry-based researchprojects, we hope to demystify scienceand make it more accessible,\" saysBarbara M.

Chu, who grew up nearProvidence, R.I., graduated fromBrown with undergraduate andmedical degrees but landed back atYale, where he continues a familytradition of developing novel treat-ments for cancer. Chu's Section of Medical Oncology is one of more than a half-dozen academic units in the Schoolof Medicine that conduct researchand provide cancer care under theumbrella of the ycc, which was established in 1974, shortly afterPresident Nixon declared the \"waron cancer.\" Modern chemotherapywas developed and first adminis-tered to patients at Yale in 1942, andthe ycc was one of the first facilities in the nation to receive the nci's Comprehensive Cancer Center designation. By capitalizing on Yale's long- standing tradition in cancer phar-macology, and its well-establishedstrengths in immunobiology anddiagnostic imaging, Chu plans tomake Yale a center of translationalresearch. \"Everyone uses the term 'trans- lation' these days, but it's extremelydifficult to carry off effectively,\" Chu says. \"Our goal is to have reallyclose crosstalk between basic scien-tists and clinical investigators, andto take findings from the clinic togain better insight into how varioustreatments work.\" A research area that holds par- ticular personal fascination for Chuis the blending of traditionalChinese medicine with moderncancer therapies. Along with Henry Bronson Professor of Pharmacology Yung-Chi\"Tommy\" Cheng, ph.d ., Chu and his team are conducting rigorous clini-cal studies to see whether these2000-year-old remedies canenhance chemotherapy's effective-ness against cancer cells and/orprotect healthy normal cells againstthe side effects experienced duringcancer treatment. Now that the new group of clinical investigators is settling in atYale, Chu says, it's time to bring allthe pieces together. \"We've gottremendous basic science; we've gotgreat core resources. We now have acritical mass of key experts in devel-oping clinical trials,\" he says. \"Itwon't take very long for Yale to beviewed not just as one of thepremier preclinical basic researchprograms, but one of the preemi-nent clinical and translational pro-grams in this country.\"Lifelines Edward Chu New collaboration with museum aims to improve science literacyRosemarie Fisher Geneticists have been hunting unsuccessfully for genes involved inTS for decades. The disorder, which begins in adolescence, is relativelycommon, affecting as many as 1per- cent of children. But symptoms of TSoften overlap with other commondiagnoses, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-decit disorder( adhd ), and there are almost cer- tainly multiple genes that may all leadto increased risk for TS. Add to thatthe tendency of adults with TS tomarry others with similar conditions,and the task of tracking suspect genesthrough extended families, a staple ofgenetic analysis, becomes extremelydifcult. T o simplify the problem, State adopted a strategy pioneered by hisY ale colleague, Chair and SterlingProfessor of Genetics and HowardHughes Institute investigatorRichard P . m.d., ph.d . \"Rather than trying to group togetherfamilies that may not have the samegenetic contribution to TS,\" Statesays, \"we looked for that one unusualpatient who would lead us to a gene.\" As reported in the October 14 issue of Science , the approach paid off when State's group found a child withboth TS and adhd who had a telltalebreak on chromo- some 13.A l e r t e d b y that defect, re-searchers suspectedthat there might be aproblem with anearby gene knownas 1, because animal studies shown that slitrk an important role inbrain development.When the team ana-lyzed 174people with TS, they found three with mutations in slitrk 1.N o mutations were found in severalhundred unaffected people, providingstrong evidence that slitrk 1was contributing to the disease. A close collaboration between State and Nenad Sestan, m.d., ph.d. , assistant professor of neurobiology,allowed the researchers to quicklydetermine the biological conse-quences of one of these mutations.Using sophisticated in utero gene delivery techniques, Sestan intro-duced either normal slitrk 1or a gene with one of the mutations foundin the subjects with TS into develop-ing mouse neurons. The intact genecaused the neurons to branch out, anecessary step for the proper wiring of neural circuits early in life. But themutated gene did not support normalbranching. The other mutation, found in two people with TS in the study, wasnearly overlooked by the researchersbecause it occurred in a regulatorypart of slitrk 1that does not affect protein structure. But further investi-gation showed that this mutation wasnot present in several thousand unaf-fected individuals, and the team'sadditional experiments suggest thatthe mutation may cause a lower levelof the slitrk 1protein to be present in some nerve cells in those with TS. The newfound mutations are rare\u2014only 2percent of those with TS in the study had them\u2014and how themutations combine with genetic orenvironmental factors to increase riskfor the disease is unknown. But slitrk 1gives researchers a long- awaited starting point for furthergenetic investigations, says State, wholikens the ndings to a string that TSresearchers can pull to begin unravel-ing the mysteries of the disorder. \"This is just the rst piece of the puzzle,\" State says. \"We hope the cluesthis gene will give us will have wide-spread ramications for understand-ing the basic biology of this disorder.\"Howard Hughes initiative aims to diversify graduatebiomedical education At age 10, Meisha Bynoe dreamed of saving lives in her Caribbeanhomeland, St. Vincent and theGrenadines. As a child, Imran Babarwas fascinated with the scienceunderlying life on his family'sMinnesota farm. Last fall, bothbrought their curiosity and passion toY ale to pursue doctorates in theCombined Program in the Biologicaland Biomedical Sciences ( bbs) with the support of Gilliam Fellowshipsawarded by the Howard HughesMedical Institute ( hhmi ). The fellowships, named for the late James H. Gilliam Jr., an hhmi trustee who was devoted to fosteringdiversity in science and education,were awarded for the rst time thisyear to a handful of outstandingminority or disadvantaged studentsin the life sciences. Although African-Americans, Hispanics and NativeAmericans make up 23percent of the U.S. population, the National ScienceFoundation reports that these groupsaccount for less than 5percent of the nation's scientists and engineersholding doctorates. hhmi is the nation's largest source of private funding for biomed-ical research and science education.Following a motto of \"people, notprojects,\" the institute is best knownfor its hhmi investigator program, which grants top scientists generousand flexible contracts, renewable atve- or seven-year intervals, to lead hhmi- supported laboratories at theirtumor formation to the MassachusettsInstitute h Babar's exrop mentor during the summer of2003 . Babar joined bbs through the Department of Cellular, Molecularand Developmental Biology. Bynoe, who is a student in the microbiology track of the bbs program, says she nds New Haven tobe \"cozy\" after four years at mit, in Cambridge, Mass., where she double-majored in biology and music andachieved a perfect grade pointaverage. Bynoe's exrop experience with hhmi investigator Richard M. Locksley, m.d., at the University of California at San Francisco in thesummer of 2004 was her rst look at a immunology lab, and she found thework to be so enjoyable that herchildhood dream of becoming aphysician has given way to a wish tospend her life in science.

Medicine @Ya le January/February 2006 3Take sleep apnea seriously, says study It can be trying to share a bed with a person affected by obstruc-tive sleep apnea, a common condi-tion in which breathing stopsrepeatedly during sleep, since loudsnoring is a telltale symptom. But astudy from the Yale Center forSleep Medicine ( ycsm ) provides new evidence that sleep apnea ismore than an annoyance. Since 1997, ycsm researchers had diagnosed sleep apnea in 697patients using polysomnography, atechnique that measures heartrate, breathing and other physio-logical variables during sleep. Afollow-up study begun in 2002revealed that 9 percent of theseindividuals suffered strokes or died,compared to only 1.6 percent of acontrol group. As reported in The New England Journal of Medicine on November 10, after eliminatingsmoking, alcohol use and hyper-tension as factors, the scientistsfound that sleep apnea doubledthe risk of stroke or death. \"Sleep apnea is a common and serious problem, but it is alsohighly treatable,\" says H. KlarYaggi, m.d ., assistant professor of medicine and lead author. \"If youor someone you know has symp-toms of sleep apnea, it is impor-tant to discuss this with a doctor.\" Mad cow's small impact explained? A recent study by neuro- pathologist Laura Manuelidis, m.d ., professor of surgery, and col-leagues in Japan may offer thebeginnings of a solution to an epi-demiological puzzle. In 1996, during an epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy( bse ), or mad cow disease, in British cattle, some epidemiolo-gists predicted that up to 100,000people could contract variantCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v cjd), a rapidly progressing, invariably fatalneurodegenerative condition, from bse -infected beef. But that nightmarish scenario hasn't yet come to pass: almost 10years later only 151 cases of v cjd have been verified. Manuelidis and her team reported in the October 21 issue ofScience that when neuronal cell cultures were infected with eithera weak or sporadic form of cjd or with agents that cause sheepscrapie, a disease similar to cjd, the cultures resisted infection by amore virulent strain of cjd agent. The team suggests that expo- sure to less virulent strains of cjd may protect people against thenewly evolved bovine agent.

Veronica Lee, m.d., assistant profes- sor of medicine, is to stop worryingfor a moment about the diet/exer-cise/motivation conundrum ofmodern life, especially if you're amiddle-aged person who driveseverywhere, eats on the go and tendsto relax in front of the television. A10-minute conversation with Lee leaves the reassuring impression thatmaybe things aren't so complicatedafter all. In 15years as a physician, Lee has seen fad diets come and go, but goodhealth, she believes, depends on bal-ance. And while the low-carbohydratetrend of the past few years may havehelped many people to lose weight, itseems to Lee that most of them gainit back over time. \"The reality is we need to have a well-balanced diet. Y ou can go forshort-term gains, but if you're throw-ing your system out of whack, theresults are probably going to beshort-lived as well,\" says Lee, who seespatients four days a week in the Y aleMedical Group ( ymg ) practice at the Y ale-New Haven Shoreline MedicalCenter in Guilford and on Fridays inNew Haven. \"The bottom line is youneed a lifestyle you can live with sothat you can achieve your target andmaintain it. That's how peopleachieve the most success.\" Trained at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons,Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Out & about Harvard School of Public Health andWashington University School ofMedicine in St. Louis, Lee came toY ale in September from St. Petersburgand West Palm Beach, Fla., where shewas in private cardiology practice forthree years and developed preventionstrategies. Lee's research focus\u2014and the driving force behind her work withpatients\u2014is prevention. Ideally, Leewants to help patients head off car-diovascular disease entirely, but shealso works to prevent it from recur-ring in patients who have suffered aheart attack. And she has a specialinterest in preventing heart disease inwomen. \"Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in women; strokeand heart attack are very signicantplayers in mortality in women, andthe numbers have been climbing,\"Lee, a fellow of the American Collegeof Cardiology, says. \"Men are gettingearlier, better and cutting back onsmoking, they're exercising more thanwomen. Women are lagging behind inexercise, and we're seeing an increasein smoking. Women's rate of heartdisease is on the rise.\" According to the American Heart Association, more women than menhave died of cardiovascular disease\u2014a category that includes coronaryheart disease, congestive heart failure,high blood pressure, stroke and dia-betes\u2014every year since 1984.In her practice, Lee helps patients set nutritional goals and works outcustomized diet and exercise plans tolower the risk of illness. \"For every-one, there are different ways ofgetting themselves off the couch andeating the right things,\" she says. \"Itry to assess the approach that's goingto work for a particular person.\" Lee is part of a new influx of Y ale physicians to the Shoreline center, an80,000-square-foot facility near Interstate 95that opened in July 2004 . ymg , the medical school's 700- emergency department diagnosticimaging, pathology, laboratory and cosmetic and surgery\u2014are spending one or more days aweek in Guilford as a convenience topatients who live east of New Haven. For Lee, whose exam room window looks out on a grove of oaktrees, the Shoreline center provides aperfect setting to convey her messageof prevention. \"Environment is a keypoint,\" she says. \"If it's a beautifullocation and it's soothing, then itcreates a warmer and more nurturingenvironment that goes along with thewhole notion of prevention.\" Lee's hopeful outlook would also be soothing to any patient castingaside entrenched old habits on thesometimes difcult road to a healthylifestyle. \"There's no such thing asfailure,\" she says. \"If you slip, you justget back up and keep trying.\"For Shoreline heart specialist, prevention is attainable goal L.

Thisstate of affairs has created a height-ened sense of urgency among Y aleresearchers and clinicians who studyand treat post-traumatic stress disor-der ( ptsd ) in collaboration with the Veterans Administration (V A). Y ale investigators at the Clinical Neuroscience Division of the V ANational Center for ptsd (cnd- ncptsd ), located at the V A Connecticut Healthcare Systemcampus in West Haven, Conn., haveestablished a new partnership withpsychiatrists at Fort Drum in upstateNew Y ork to study how troops reactto combat experiences. Meanwhile, clinicians at the V A 's West Haven campus have expandedtheir staff to care for an expectedinflux of veterans needing treatmentfor anxiety and ptsd . John H. Krystal, m.d. , Robert L. McNeil Jr. Professor of ClinicalPharmacology, deputy chair of thedepartment of psychiatry, and direc-tor of the cnd-ncptsd , notes that about 196,000 veterans have a diagno- sis of ptsd , which costs the V A $ 274 million per year\u2014 13percent of its total medical costs. With our troopsnow engaged in two wars, he says,these numbers will only increase. \"Recent survey data suggest that 10to 20percent of soldiers participat- ing in combat in Iraq meet criteriafor ptsd ,\" says Krystal.Veterans traumatized by war\u2014or people distressed by any other eventin which they fear death or greatharm to themselves or others\u2014can bediagnosed with ptsd if they events in flashbacks ornightmares, hypervigilance andretreating from life and relationships. Next summer, Krystal and Professor of Psychiatry and PublicHealth Robert A. Rosenheck, m.d. , will begin a $ 6.9million nationwide study funded by the V A that will testthe effectiveness of the medicationrisperidone for veterans with chronic ptsd . The drug is a potential alterna- tive to antidepressants, such asProzac, that are usually prescribed. The study is the latest in a long- term effort by Y ale investigators, whohave pioneered ptsd research and clinical care. In the early 1970s, Y ale psychia- trist Arthur S. Blank Jr., m.d. , was one of the rst clinicians in thenation to develop peer-support pro-grams for veterans suffering from thestress-related symptoms now knownas ptsd . In 1989, when the ncptsd was established at ve campuses acrossthe country, the Clinical Neuro-science Division was based at V A 'sWest Haven campus in order to forgecollaborations with the strong basicand clinical neuroscience programs at Y ale.The cnd-ncptsd has gone on to become one of the most importantcenters advancing our understandingof the neurobiology and treatment of ptsd . \"Very early on, West Haven became a center where they reallyunderstood ptsd ,\" says Steven M. Southwick, m.d. , professor of psychi- atry, a researcher at the West Havencampus of V A Connecticut. Southwick says that studying the neurobiology of stress responses\u2014nding a physical manifestation of apsychological problem\u2014has helpedclinicians to understand ptsd better and to explore more effective treat-ments. \"Before, it was all interpretedpsychologically,\" he says. T o prepare for the needs of returning troops, the V A ConnecticutHealthcare System has recentlyreceived additional funding to expandclinical services to returning combatveterans, according to DoloresVojvoda, m.d. , assistant professor of psychiatry at the medical school andhead of the ptsd and Anxiety Disorder Service in West Haven. Vojvoda reports that, by December, therapists in her ptsd clinic had treated about 75Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and she expectsthe numbers to grow quickly. \"We are at a critical moment in the lives of the soldiers who havemade sacrices on behalf of everyAmerican citizen,\" says Krystal. \"Weas a country have to decide whetherwe are going to return the favor bysupporting our soldiers and respect-ing the sacrices they have made bymaking sure they get the treatmentthey need and by making sure we canimprove the treatments we are offer-ing them.\" tists who now work across the Y ale campus. \"I am very excited about this new neuroscience initiative addressing thebasic mechanisms of brain functiontogether with a number of devastat-ing diseases,\" Professor of MedicineRobert J. Alpern, m.d. \"The success of the program is ensured by theextraordinary quality of its twoleaders, both of whom have per-formed groundbreaking research inthis arena.\" De Camilli says the new program will foster research on molecular andcellular aspects of nervous systemfunction in both health and disease.De Camilli's pioneering work onsynaptic vesicles, the cellular packetsthat deliver intothe junction between nerve cells, isbringing new understanding ofnormal brain function while alsogiving insights into pathologicalmechanisms. In addition to grants from federal agencies, De Camilli's researchreceives support from The HumanFrontier Science Program Organi-zation as well as the G. Harold andLeila Y. Mathers CharitableFoundation.\"The creation of a program focused both on the cell biology ofthe nervous system and on its dis-eases recognizes that innovativeresearch on pathogenetic mechanismscan best thrive in an environmentwhere basic science research is verystrong,\" says De Camilli, who is also aHoward Hughes Medical Instituteinvestigator. \"I am delighted to startthis new initiative with Dr. SteveStrittmatter, who has already beenvery successful in bridging funda-mental neuroscience clinicallyimportant problems.\" Five years ago, Strittmatter a protein that blocks theregeneration of axons. His labora-tory's research on this important reg-ulator (see Advances, top left) has suggested potential therapies forbrain and spinal cord injuries, strokeand neurodegenerative disorders suchas amyotrophiclateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease)and multiple sclerosis. \"Establishing a hub for cellular and molecular studies in neuro-science with interdisciplinary andinterdepartmental connection holdsgreat promise for many majorresearch advances by Y ale neuro-science,\" Strittmatter says. \"Thisprogram will illuminate our under- standing of how nerve cells functionand communicate in the brain, espe-cially as they relate to the develop-ment of novel therapies, such asneural repair, for neurodegenerativediseases.\" Strittmatter's work is sup-ported by The Amyotrophic LateralSclerosis Association, the Dr. Ralphand Marian Falk Medical ResearchTrust and the Christopher ReeveParalysis Foundation. Pasko Rakic, m.d. ,ph.d., chair and DubergProfessor of Neurobiology and direc-tor of the Kavli Institute at Y ale, saidthe decision to focus on neurodegen-eration, neural repair and the neu-ronal basis of cognitive function anddysfunction was an outcome of manymeetings and deliberations of theSchool of Medicine's Basic ScienceResearch Strategic PlanningCommittee. \"Research on neurodegeneration and brain repair is one of the mostdifcult and most noble goals ofneuroscience,\" Rakic says. \"Modernresearch methods will allow newadvances.

But soon, mostneural circuits become hard-wired. Fixed circuits are reliable but costly: the injured brain can rarelyrepair itself. In 2000, Stephen M.Strittmatter, m.d ., Vincent Coates Professor of Neurology, identifiedNogo (green in the brain sectionabove), a protein that suppressesself-repair in injured neurons. Areport in the September 30 issue ofScience indicates that Nogo may also lock down cortical wiringduring normal development. The visual cortex is normally divided equally between inputsfrom each eye. But if one eye iskept shut during a \"critical period\"before neural andcolleagues showed that in micebred to lack the Nogo receptor, anactive eye can usurp cortical realestate well past the critical periodinto adulthood. Noting that \"limited plasticity is central to a range of neurologicaldisorders,\" Strittmatter is testingNogo blockers to see if reviving thebrain's inborn flexibility can help itto heal after injury. Cool therapy helps after troubled births If the placenta or umbilical cord are torn or squeezed before orduring childbirth, or if the uterusruptures, many infants suffer froma severe form of oxygen depriva-tion known as hypoxic-ischemicencephalopathy, or hie, that can cause disabilities, such as cerebralpalsy, or death. A new study by a nationwide network of researchers, includingRichard A. Ehrenkranz, m.d ., profes- sor of pediatrics and of obstetrics,gynecology and reproductive sci-ences, shows that a simple therapythat lowers newborns' brain tem-perature can reduce disability anddeath after hie. As reported in the October 13 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine , the researchers placed babies with hie on water-cooled blankets that lowered their bodytemperature to 92.3 degrees within6 hours after birth. Only 44 percentof the infants who received thecooling treatment developed dis-abilities or died, compared to 62percent of a control group. The cooling therapy \"slows down the injury process caused bybirth asphyxia,\" says Ehrenkranz.\"Less injury means a better out-come and fewer cases of cerebralpalsy and other complications.\"Advances Health and science news from Yale John Krystal Medicine @Ya le January/February 2006 5 Neuroscience continued from page 1Steven Southwick6 www.medicineatyale.orgpoint out. And thanks to the flexibil- ity of the brain's circuitry early in life,he says that, with early intervention,dyslexic children may be able to com-pensate for their disability by trainingneural circuits other than thoseaffected by the gene when they learnto read. \"If children with dyslexia can get the right education program early on,they will be successful,\" Gruen says.\"We're hoping that someday we canuse genetic information to match kidsto their ideal intervention as early aspossible.\"researchers have discovered a gene that may cause many cases of dyslexiaby interfering with early brain devel-opment. The gene, dcdc2 ,i s required for neurons to migrate nor-mally and is disrupted in up to 20 percent of people with dyslexia. \"Our results validate and conrm the fact that dyslexia is genetic,\" sayssenior researcher Jeffrey R. Gruen, m.d. , associate professor of pediatrics and an investigator at the Y ale ChildHealth Research Center. \"Based onbrain imaging data, we know thatdyslexics seem to have a disruptedbrain reading circuit, and we thinkthat variants of dcdc2 could be responsible for disrupting circuit for-mation during development.\" Besides illuminating the cause of dyslexia, the identication of dcdc2 could lead to genetic tests to identifyat-risk children early on, when educa-tional interventions are most effec-tive, Gruen says. The work, presented at the October meeting of the AmericanSociety for Human Genetics, waspublished in the November 22issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Dyslexia is dened as an impair- ment in reading ability in people withnormal intelligence and adequateeducational opportunities. For thelast 15years, researchers have been on the trail of a gene for dyslexia theyhad traced to human chromosome 6. In 2002 , Gruen and colleagues nar-rowed the search to a stretch of 1.5 million dna base pairs containing 19 candidate genes, all of which wereknown to be active in the brain. T o get a closer look at those 19 genes in normal readers and dyslex-ics, Gruen and his team analyzed 536 parents and children from 153fami- lies, correlating dna sequences with the children's scores on a battery ofreading and comprehension tests. They quickly saw that in children with low reading scores, sequence variations clustered most often in the area of dcdc2 . The researchers hit pay dirt when they noticed that insome dyslexic subjects, one copy ofthe dcdc2 gene was missing nearly 2,500\"letters\" of dna code. This deletion is uncommon in the generalU.S. population, but it was seen innearly 20percent of the study partici- pants with dyslexia. The dcdc2 deletion does not affect the structure or function of thegene's protein product, but Gruenand his colleagues believe it reducesthe overall amount of messengerrna , and hence protein, in nerve cells. They then demonstrated thatneurons did not migrate properly inthe developing brains of fetal rats inwhich dcdc2 expression was experi- mentally suppressed (see photosabove). While the team hasn't yet con- rmed that dcdc2 protein levels are lower in dyslexic people, they didestablish that in normal adulthumans the gene is most active inbrain regions involved in reading. The newly found gene has no relation to IQ, Gruen is quick to(Left) Nerve cells have migrated in an orderly fashion toward the outermost layer of the cortex (top of photo) in the brain of a normal 14-day-old embryonic rat.

Brownell says the center will support corporatecampaigns based on solid science butwill criticize those found to be short-term, ineffective or misleading. Using ndings by social scientists on effective techniques of persuasion,Rudd Center researchers also plan tocreate compelling new public healthmessages that encourage exercise andgood nutrition. The societal stigma surrounding weight has been a major concern ofthe Rudd Foundation, and the newcenter will conduct and sponsorresearch on how weight bias affectsemotional well-being in overweightindividuals. \"I was once a lot more over- weight than I am now,\" Ruddexplains, \"and it gave me a rst-handinsight into what people who areoverweight feel and the discrimina-tion they face.\" Rudd believes that the psycho- logical pressure of weight stigma canbe so severe as to be disabling, and hesees his achievements in business as ameans to help others overcome thephysical and psychological burdens ofobesity. \"Many overweight people are so held back by this one stigma thatthey're not very successful,\" Ruddsays. \"I became relatively successful. Ithought that establishing the centerwas something that needed to bedone, and now there are a lot ofpeople joining us.\"The sharply rising rate of obesity in America over the past two decadeshas engendered a erce public debate,pitting those who hold the foodindustry responsible for making andpromoting unhealthy foods againstthose who believe that obesity resultsfrom a failure of personal responsibil-ity and self-control. Enter Leslie Rudd, who made his fortune in the food and beverageindustry but who also struggled withhis weight, and with the resultingstigma, for much of his life. It isRudd's hope that Y ale's new RuddCenter for Food Policy and Obesity,established with his $ 7.5million, ve- year gift, will represent a fresh start inthe ght against obesity and againstthe discrimination faced by over-weight and obese individuals. The new center's director, Kelly D. Brownell, ph.d. , professor and chair of psychology at Y ale and pro-fessor of epidemiology at the Schoolof Medicine, is a well-known critic ofthe food industry, but he and Ruddshare a strong belief that curbing theobesity crisis will require seismicshifts in our society's approach tofood and eating. \"The only hope of preventing obesity lies in understanding andchanging the fundamental economic,political and social factors thatpromote consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods alongwith physical inactivity,\" saysBrownell, who was elected to theInstitute of Medicine in October (see related story, page 1). \"We believe that real change requires nothing less thanreal change.\" Rudd, ceo and principal owner of Kansas-based wine and liquor dis-tributor Standard Beverage Corp.,luxury foods purveyor Dean andDeLuca and Rudd Winery, a high-endwine producer in Napa Valley, Calif.,sees no contradiction between a life atthe heart of the food industry and hisfounding in 1998 of the Rudd Foundation, which is committed toending obesity and discriminationagainst overweight individuals. \"Idon't think that they're mutually exclusive,\" he says. \"I think that theobesity issue is separate from theenjoyment of food and wine.\" Accordingly, a key component of the Rudd Center's mission is to serveas a \"safe space,\" away from theprovocative arenas of politics and themedia, where leaders of food andagriculture companies can meet withscientists, public health ofcials andeducators for candid exchanges onissues of nutrition and obesity. The center also plans to monitor and evaluate the food industry'sefforts to provide healthier foods and Leslie Rudd speaks at the dedication of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity as center Director Kelly Brownell (left) and Yale President Richard Levin (center) look on.Unlikely allies, common goals in ght against obesity Dyslexia continued from page 1 The discovery could lead to genetic tests that would identify children with reading problems early, when interventions are most effective.Federal Serap Aksoy ,nih,Trypanosome Absorption $ 2,043,750 Roland Baron ,nih,Role the in Osteoblasts ,5years, $ 1,798,500 Sumita Sonia Caprio , nih,Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Youth ,5years, $ 2,043,750 R.

Membership in embo is a life-long honor and scientists are elected onthe basis of proven excellence inresearch. Among the organization'smembers are some of Europe'sleading researchers, including 38 Nobel Prize winners. embo was established in 1964 to create a central molecular biologylaboratory and to build a networkthat would enhance interactionsamong European laboratories.Currently there are more than 1,200 embo members in Europe, and only 60investigators outside of Europe have been named as associatemembers. Mellman uses a combination of biochemical, genetic and imagingmethods to understand complexfunctions of cell biology, especially inthe immune system. Another area ofhis research involves the molecularmechanisms that sort, target andtransport cell membrane componentsto appropriate locations in differenttypes of cells. After receiving his undergraduate degree at Oberlin College, Mellmanearned his doctorate in genetics fromY ale in 1978. He began his academic career as a postdoctoral fellow and anassistant professor at RockefellerUniversity and then joined the Y alefaculty in 1981. From 1997 to 2001 Mellman served as founding director of Y ale'sCombined Program in Biological andBiomedical Sciences, which united allthe disparate department-based grad-uate programs at the School of Medi-cine and the main Y ale campus. Mellman, who holds a joint appointment in the Department ofImmunobiology, is editor-in-chief ofThe Journal of Cell Biology and is on the editorial boards of Cell and The Journal of Experimental Medicine .H e is an afliate member of the LudwigInstitute for Cancer Research and wasnamed scientic director of the Y aleCancer Center in 2003 . He holds a senior fellowship at Lincoln College, University ofOxford, where he served as Newton-Abraham Professor. Mellman is also afellow of the American Academy ofArts and Sciences; a member ofnumerous advisory boards in thepublic and private sectors in the U.S.,Europe and Australia; the recipient ofan nih merit award and the Y ale Science and Engineering SocietyMedal. Mellman has deliveredendowed lectures throughout theworld, including the nih Director's Lecture. Ira Mellman At the end of World War II, Nicholas P .R. Spinelli, m.d ., took leave from his Army unit in Germanyand hitched a ride on a cargo plane toRome. From there he traveled toFaeto, a village in southern Italy over-looking the Adriatic Sea that hisparents had left 30years earlier, and where the villagers celebrated thearrival of their native son. \"I wasthere for three nights,\" says Spinelli, a1941 alumnus of Y ale College and 1944 alumnus of the School of Medicine. \"Ihad to make rounds and visit everysick person in the village.\" His triumphant return to his family's ancestral community was theresult of his parents' belief in educa-tion and Spinelli's own belief in thevalue of his education at Y ale. Hadthey stayed in Italy, Spinelli said, hisparents would never have been ableto educate their yet unborn children,Nicholas and his sister, Viola.\"Education was a passion with bothmy parents,\" he says. \"That was whythey were working so hard.\" Throughout his career, Spinelli has shown his loyalty to Y ale byraising money for the medical school,joining with his classmates to estab-lish a scholarship fund, serving as themedical school's director of alumniaffairs and sponsoring the rst WhiteAlumnus receives Y ale Medal for his decades of service The six elected in October, who were honored at a December recep-tion in the Medical Historical Library,are Kelly D.

In November the Association of Y ale Alumni awarded Spinelli the Y aleMedal, which, since 1952, has honored outstanding service to the university.In this recognition, Spinelli joins suchother medical school graduates andfaculty members as pediatricianGrover F. Powers, m.d .; Russell B. Scobie, m.d .; William L. Kissick, m.d .,m.p.h .,dr.ph .; Muriel DuBrow Wolf, m.d .; and former Dean Milton C. Winternitz, m.d . Spinelli's path to Y ale began in Stratford, Conn., where his parentshad settled. His father ran severalbusinesses, including a gas stationand a restaurant on the Boston PostRoad, then the main thoroughfarebetween New Y ork and Boston. In 1937 Spinelli entered Y ale College, planning to become a writer.At the end of his freshman year,however, he took a job in a biologylaboratory, where a professor encour-aged him to study medicine, and inthe fall of 1941 he entered the School of Medicine. A few months later, while prepar- ing for an anatomy exam, he heardPresident Roosevelt announce on theradio that the nation was at war. Spinelli and his 43classmates were inducted into the Army, and theirmedical education was accelerated tomeet wartime needs. Upon his dis-charge Spinelli returned to Stratfordto practice internal medicine. A heartattack forced his retirement in 1958, but he began a second career as direc-tor of medical education at Bridge-port Hospital. In the 1980 s his second career gave way to a third, as directorof alumni affairs at the medicalschool. His main concern there wason what he called \"incubatingalumni,\" strengthening relations withstudents and bringing them into thefold by including them in alumnievents. At that time he helped createthe Committee on the Well-being ofStudents, which makes a report eachyear on issues of concern to students. Perhaps his greatest gift to the medical school was at his 40th reunion in 1984, when he asked his classmates to contribute to a scholar-ship fund over the next decade. Bythen, he said, the fund would be largeenough to offer its rst scholarship.In 1994 , with 100percent participa- tion from the class, the fund helpedto support a rst-year student; it can now assist up to three studentsthrough their rst year. \"I have gottenletters from students who have beengiven the scholarship, saying howimportant it was and how theycouldn't have gone to medical schoolwithout it,\" Spinelli says. For his service to Y ale, Spinelli received the Distinguished ServiceAward from the Association of Y aleAlumni in Medicine in 1987 and the Peter Parker Medal in 1994 .I n r e c o g - nition of his contributions to themedical school, two rooms were dedi-cated in Spinelli's honor in 2000 ,o n e at the pva/epva Neuroscience and Regeneration Research Center at theV A Connecticut Healthcare System inWest Haven and the other at themedical school's Ofce of AlumniAffairs. But no honor, he says, surpasses one he received when he was 16years old: \"The greatest gift I got was theletter saying I was accepted to Y ale.\" cles inside cells that are necessary to convert genetic information intoactive proteins.
