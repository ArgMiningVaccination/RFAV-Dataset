Canada Conform\u00e9ment a la loi canadienne sur la protection de la Labyrinth transformative site, symbol, and technology: An arts-informed inquiry Vanessa Compton Doctor of Philosophy, 2007 Department of Curriculum, Teaching and Learning, University of Toronto ABSTRACT The unicursal labyrinth was first inlayed in the pavement of the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Chartres in France in 1200 CE, coincident with the flowering of the School of Chartres, where the Ars Liberales curriculum formalised dialectic inquiry, technologies of the imagination, and recursive spiritual development. Reclaimed in recent years for walking meditation, the labyrinth functions, in the context of post-structural, holistic and aesthetic education, as a site of experiential learning and a technology for guiding the imagination into transformative patterns of thought. Its image symbolizes the order-versus-confusion binary characteristic of the integrative processes of personal development. This research project focuses on understandings drawn from existing literature on the historical, mythological, and mathematical labyrinth, the accounts of individual seekers and practitioners, and the author's personal experience from five years as labyrinth \"keeper\" in an urban parish church in Canada. Three personal essays document this involvement with the labyrinth from the dramatic first encounter, through intellectual quest and personal pilgrimage, to responsibility for installation and maintenance as public sacred art in a host community. The inquiry includes an extensive literature review of the historical site and the many avenues of approach to understanding the interaction between place, identity, and learning that occurs in the labyrinth. Grounded in hermeneutic aesthetics and the methods of auto-ethnography, phenomenology and arts-based research, the inquiry investigates the connection between this ancient, mathematically significant site, the experience of reflective engagement with it, and contemporary interpretations of pilgrimage conceptualised as intentional seeking in the developmental process of self. Implications for education lie both in the labyrinth's symbolic function as a public art form demarcating and validating ritual space for care of the self, and in its capacity to activate the incubation of individual and collective imagination, bring about shifts in perception, restore personal equilibrium and perspective, and access tacit knowledge and inner wisdom. The medieval designers intended that users experience the characteristic sense of integrated consciousness and heightened imaginative function, a heritage that is to be welcomed at this historical juncture. il GRATITUDE I have been blessed in this lifetime with great teachers, wise friends, and fine companions who have illuminated the Path through their gifts of witness, storytelling, insight and example. This thesis would not exist at all if it weren't for the work of the Reverend Dr. Lauren Artress. Her untiring effort to explore and articulate with humour, generosity, and wisdom a planetary vision of the labyrinth \u2014 and along the way showing what a difference one person can make in this world \u2014 has been an inspiration for which I am very grateful. I owe much to the Reverend Patrick Doran, brother-in-spirit and comrade of countless \"Benedictine\" hours maintaining the St. Paul's Labyrinth, who taught me most of what I know about pilgrimage, mission, and service. I extend sincere gratitude to the members of my doctoral thesis committee, my supervisor Dr. Jack Miller, Professor David Booth, and Dr. Linda Cameron, for their commitment of time and energy, and for providing an incomparable model of collegiality and intellectual support. I would like to thank also to the Department of Curriculum, Teaching and Learning at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto for its continuous financial support within the department and through the Ontario Graduate Studies scholarship program. Thanks also go to Margaret Brennan and Mary MacDonell in Student Services for their patience over the years of administering these funds. Much appreciation goes to these generous friends: Mary Ann O'Connor, for careful reading and commentary; McEvoy Galbreath, in whose company every step lands on sacred ground; and Michael Fletcher, for cheerleading, spreadsheets, and dinner. Last, but not least, I wish to say \"Thank you, kids,\" to Selena, Aretha, and Nicholas Black, for your energy, optimism, and faith wherein lies the hope of this emerging world. iil TABLE OF CONTENTS ABSTRACT oooooo cece eeccccceceneceeseesceeeeeeecaeecaecceaaeceaeeceaesseaeeseeeseacessneeecaeeeseesseaeeteseeeeenaas II GRATITUDE... ..eecccecececcesceceseeseeeceseeeeaeeeeeseeseeaecaeeeececeeseeceeceessesreaasreeeeesesieeeeenaeas ti TABLE OF CONTENTS . 00... .eeccceecceeeeeeceeeesneeceereeeeeeaeeenaeeeneesseseeseeseeeseseeeeeseasenits IV PREFACE ooo. cecccccecesccnceeeceeeeseeseceeecaeeseecaeseeecaesesseceeaeseseeseaeeaeeeeesnesseeenevereesseneey V ILLUSTRATIONS. 0.0.0... cccceccecceeceseeeeeseesceseeeceseeseeseeaececeseseseesecetetertietineneseeseneniess VII 1.

For my class presentation, I had chosen as my topic the unicursal (single path) labyrinth, about which I knew nothing. Using a pattern I found on the Internet, the class laid out a seven-circuit labyrinth in tape on the floor. Then we all walked through it together. I assumed that, because we were engaged in purely \"intellectual\" pursuits, the information concerning ritual process in the material I had gathered about the labyrinth was entirely theoretical, and not applicable to a classroom situation. The presentation went well: the class was cooperative and the labyrinth looked beautiful. We had fun, except for one of the older students who complained of feeling crowded and nauseous. I had underestimated the power of experiential learning. The following week, this student described the aftermath of the presentation. A violent incident at home over the weekend had triggered the insight that her marriage was a labyrinth, with her abusive husband as the Minotaur at the centre! She decided to institutionalize him for previously diagnosed early stage Alzheimer's disease and had set the process in motion the very same day, to the great relief of their adult children. The story she recounted of revelation and personal transformation was so impressive that I felt compelled to learn all I could about this phenomenon (Compton, 2002). How could such an innocent, even clueless, undertaking could have such a profound effect? It did not seem to matter whether participants believed in the power of the labyrinth or that they even be aware of it. That suggested that the pattern was intentionally planned to have a particular effect\u2014at least the one I had witnessed (and what did that signify, in the world of scholarly synchronicity?)\u2014 and perhaps others as well. This unleashed a cascade of questions: Who had designed this thing? What were they thinking? What could we learn from it? Most important, were there implications for education in such a life-altering site? In pursuit of answers, I explored the mathematics of the labyrinth, the mentality of its twelfth century designers, its first appearance at Chartres Cathedral, and its connection with the School of Chartres, where the Medieval crafts of thought, imaginative invention, and dialectics had been honed. I undertook pilgrimages to Grace Cathedral in San Francisco and Chartres Cathedral in France, learning about the labyrinth with the guidance of Dr. Lauren Artress at each site. Meanwhile, Rev. Patrick Doran and I installed a Chartres type labyrinth at St. Paul's Westdale (Anglican) in Hamilton, Ontario; where for five years we kept the labyrinth open to the public, and I practiced what I had learned of facilitating people's encounters with this transformative walking meditation. These experiences provide the material for the three essays in the \"Labyrinth as Laboratory\" section of this thesis. Leading up to the \"Laboratory\" stories are sections arranged in the following order. First, an introduction lays out the larger social and educational problems for which the labyrinth may provide a solution. Second, an outline of the objectives of the study focuses these concerns in the form of three research questions. Third, I provide an explanation of the arts-informed methodology of inquiry, which came out of the labyrinth's image generating function. Fourth, a discussion of the thesis' theoretical orientation identifies the ways in which the labyrinth functions as an organising principle. Fifth, in the literature review, I examine material relevant to the central question of what the implications of the labyrinth's capacities could be for education. The sixth section, \"Understanding the Labyrinth,\" covers the labyrinth's origins including historical context, design, mathematical specifications, and its place in contemplative geometry. After the \"Laboratory\" essays, I discuss the implications for education. A compendium of related material is found in the Appendices.

INTRODUCTION Worrying on a large scale As an educator, I wonder about the invention of new worlds, though not as often, or as anxiously, as I long for a collective rediscovery of ways of perceiving this one. The consequences of our species' political, economic, scientific and industrial projects of the last several centuries require of us a profound shift in awareness, a collective awakening that some consider an evolution in consciousness, an entelechy' whose time has come (Berry, 1999; Capra, Zohar & Marshall, 1994). Confronted with massive environmental evidence of our failure to imagine ourselves as interconnected, mutually responsible co- creators and to act accordingly, cast adrift from the certainty of a predictable life span in a recognisable homeland, there is a tendency to respond to the crisis of continuing existence as we know it by clinging to ideologies and fundamentalisms, by encapsulating ourselves in privilege, in denial, in a remote scientism or abiding faith in progress, by rampaging in \"joyous brutality\" (in Wilber's ramped-up take on the \"self-forgetting joy\" of intentional aggression), so prevalent in the bloody accounts from this young century's war-zones. Surviving another day is the most many can hope for. Some who do make their conceptual way to an evolutionary Terra Nova are mapping terrains of possibility. But we do not know what this \"new\" world will be. Nor can we say for certain how best to educate those who will inhabit it. More pressing still is the question of how are we to educate those, ourselves among them, who could imagine and create it. We need educative experiences and organising principles that make it possible for humans to transcend the cultural habits of mind, the cognitive templates and unexamined assumptions that underlie, for example, the perceptual framework known as \"from Greek entelekheia : entel\u00e9s, complete ( en-, result)+ ekhein, to have. \"In Aristotle a: the full realization of form-giving cause or energeia as contrasted with mere potential existence b: the form that actuates this realization\" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Merriam-Webster, Springfield, 1986 (orig. 1961). \"*Entelechy' is also a technical term in Leibniz for the primitive active force in every monad...\" (The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995). Cartesian monocularism into which we are all embedded. This conceptualisation of the world as an object apart from oneself (Abram, 1997; Gablik, 1991, 1993; Jay, 1988; Levin, 1989; Lowe, 1982; Romanyshyn, 1989) has made possible, in its extreme form, a disconnect from the lifeworld\u2014from Creation itself one could say\u2014so acute that biblical Apocalypse is construed literally, in the minds of key figures in the current Bush administration of the US government, as the desirable, even triumphant outcome of Middle East instability\u2014with money righteously to be made in oil and armaments along the way\u2014 rather than the geo-political quagmire and impending environmental disaster so obvious and inevitable to other observers: laughable, if it weren't so tragic (Monbiot, 2004; Moyers, 2005). This is a state of despair that needs drastic re-framing (Macy, 1998) if its apparent inevitability is to be revealed as a delusion to which the alternative is being awake, conscientious, and engaged in the decision to act on behalf of a new, inhabitable, sustainable, imaginable world. What the Dalai Lama said A model of such mindfulness is Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama. A gentle individual, slightly stooped, with bright eyes and an air of amusement, His Holiness has a charismatic presence. While in Canada in 2004 to lead the ten-day Kalachakra teachings on behalf of peace and healing for the world, HH gave a public lecture in Ottawa. When he walked across the auditorium stage at the Civic Centre, a surge of energy radiated over the capacity crowd, setting us all into a state of tingling receptivity.\" The Dalai Lama had much to say to his Canadian audience that day, but two statements stood out for me. The first was that education must be our first priority, so that our children learn to respond instinctively to the new, not in fear, but with the intention of dialogue. His conviction that a positive disposition towards the new could be both instinctive and intentional, and was something that could be taught was striking. Is the * The sensation brought back the memory of sitting and writing at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in San Francisco early one bright cold autumn morning, before a training session in labyrinth facilitation at Grace Cathedral. Suddenly a wave of energy rolled over me with such intensity that I looked up from my notebook. Walking silently down the street towards me were two Tibetan Buddhist nuns with shaven heads and plain brown robes, their only adornment the brilliant colours of Buddha's Eyes embroidered on their hessian shoulder bags. We looked towards each other, our eyes met; then the two nuns passed by, the flow of energy receding in their wake, the impression of their quiet power reverberating into my memory. fight-or-flight fear response one that we teach, or do we simply suppress it or condition it systematically? Can we say the same about the response of welcome, the \"intention of dialogue\"? Do we suppress and condition that instinct as well? The second comment, in response to a question from the audience concerning the Dalai Lama's own practice, was that he himself was endlessly curious, always wondering, \"How does this person see things? How does this person think?\" Such an attitude towards others assumes not only a perspective different from one's own, but also\u2014 implied in this particular definition of the word \"dialogue\" as \"a musical composition for two or more parts suggestive of a conversation\" (OED, 1971)\u2014in its profound willingness to hear another, a respect for what Levin calls the \"irreducible, unpossessable dimensionality\" of other \"sonorous beings,\" with whom we are simultaneously interconnected and yet always, and properly, distinct (1989, pp. 51, 64). Fellow pilgrims \"Easy for him to say,\" we muttered, \"he's the Dalai Lama. That's practically God.\" But the following month, a conference in honour of eco-theologian Thomas Berry' at the University of Toronto provided an opportunity to witness again, in another meeting of very disparate cultural traditions, the call for dialogue, for recognition of the Other \"speaking,\" but this time in forms even more distinctly alternative to the Western canonical\u2014invocations during Anishnabe pipe ceremony, chant and smudge, in emphatic Yoruba prayer, in lightning fast capoeira ritual \"fight\" sequence, in poetry, dance and mime\u2014even in sea-lion vernacular and the olfactory utterance of apple blossom, thanks to David Abrams' spell-binding stories of voice and place. Many of these calls required us the \"audience\"\u2014or, more precisely, the congregation, the brought- forward, the prayed-for and prayed-with\u2014to participate responsively. Together we were 3 Spirit Matters: Wisdom Traditions and the Great Work, took place May 13-16, 2004, sponsored by the Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto, with co-sponsors the Indigenous Education Network at OJSE/UT, Resurgence Magazine, and Mpambo, the African Multiversity, in collaboration with Paulo Freire Institute (Brazil), the Centre for Ecology and Spirituality, and the Institute for Environmental Studies (both UT). http://tlc.oise.utoronto.ca/conf2004/call.html Proceedings are published as Circles of Transformation: Finding our Way in the \"Great Work.\" ISBN 1-4120-8916-6, available through www/trafford.com. flattened into our seats by the force of the ideas expressed from the stage, then drawn to our feet in appreciation; we took the parts of sea-creatures in modern versions of Medieval morality plays, and re-enacted our childhood classroom squirming\u2014and the escape into the body; we \"acknowledged our grandfathers who came in with us,\" Merleau-Ponty's \"the 'others' along with whom I haunt a single, present, and actual Being\" resonating in this aboriginal ritual speech (1964, p. 168); we identified with and spoke from our totem animals* in small discussion groups; variously we added our voices and bodies and attention to circles of support in chant, prayer, incantation and drumming. Returned thus to body and to communion (\"coming together in a gathering,\" as transpersonal psychologist Jorge Ferrer pointed out, rather than \"attending a conference') we were receptive to the discourse opening up around Berry's legacy of \"The Great Work\"\u2014 the project of healing the planet and co-envisioning a future. These concepts are based in eco-cosmology, the stories cutting across lines of race, class, gender, species: if the earth itself is the centre of human consciousness, the degree to which we are disconnected from it is a measure of our dys-ease. The discussions focused on the questions: \"From where we are now, what is the next step?\" \"How do we bring these into being?\" \"What is wisdom? How do we pass it on?\" These reverberated with the Dalai Lama's message about education. Several themes' become apparent in the conference presentations: (1) the prevalence of embodied knowledge in indigenous and transpersonal wisdom traditions; (2) the necessity\u2014and fragility, and sometimes loss\u2014of a felt sense of place and of being at home, neither divided nor exiled; (3) the preservation and transmission of culture and ritual as inclusive community practice; (4) the use of metaphor, myth and story to locate, explore, and articulate necessary truths; (5) the primary importance of relationships with (all) the Other(s) based in mutual respect rather than instrumentalism; (6) the recognition of the need to move language beyond the categories characteristic of dualism and \"Tcan report that the Gorilla people care for one another by grooming and delousing, settle at night in big trees, move along without stripping the land, nourish themselves with an abundance of bananas, stand strong and grounded, and moderate our tendency to \"monkeying\" with gravitas and discernment. > See Appendix 2. supremacy to new, more inclusive forms of \"mutuality and inter-being,\" language \"stored deep within the body as memories for us to access.\"\"\u00ae The themes identified by these wise and worried elders and teachers resonated strongly with my findings about the labyrinth. I was increasingly convinced of its relevance to education as a powerful tool for making the perceptual shift out of 21\u00b0 century habits of mind into the memory-relics, \"bones and artefacts\" of our species' elders and traditions, to seek out these new forms of mutuality and inter-being. It was clear that learning to discern among them was essential to the educational project of our time, how to restore Earth and create sustainable peace. It made sense that such knowledge would be embodied and experiential, conveying through image and articulating in metaphor its subtle insights into perception, relationship and communion. All of these qualities were characteristic of the labyrinth experience. Curiosity about what happens to someone walking in a labyrinth became inextricably linked for me with the much larger question, \"\"What has this got to do with contemporary education?\" \u00b0 Ideas on language presented by bell hooks and Rene Schilling respectively. \"Inter-being\" is a term introduced by the Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh to describe our interdependence. 2. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY We are within that pattern, and we can enable that pattern to have its consciousness through us. Stephen Dunn, \"geo-logian.\"\" Transformation of a species necessarily begins with transformation at the personal level. I have come to believe that such a transformation was the intention of the designers of the labyrinth. If the labyrinth can be considered a \"bone and artefact,\" a memory-relic, and its Medieval designers our ancestors and elders, then an account of how it functions has implications for the education necessary to bring about cultural and spiritual healing. The aim of this work is to provide such an account, by tracing and explicating the cumulative learning that has come about through my involvement with this ancient, spatial technology. When I began studying the labyrinth in 1997, the field was new and wide open for investigation. Dr. Lauren Artress has described her early work with the labyrinth in the early 1990s as \"building a plane while flying it.\" As I write this, several years on, practices have become established in a variety of community settings, with patterns and cycles becoming discernible. At the same time, the social and political world has moved on to become in many ways darker, more fearful, more polarized since the World Trade Center attacks of September 2001. (It is no small irony or coincidence of history that the Gothic cathedral labyrinths were designed and constructed at the same time as the Crusades were taking place.) While at one level, this inquiry provides a personal account of a developmental and spiritual journey within an evolving social movement in local communities, it is with the understanding that this is going on in the shadow of much larger events. In the context of global trauma and planetary rehabilitation, the development of human potential takes on critical importance. The first question of the inquiry therefore asks: ' At the Spirit Matters gathering. Dr. Dunn was the founder and first director of the Elliott Allen Institute for Theology and Ecology at the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. 6 (1) In what ways could the labyrinth be part of an educational response to the pressing evolutionary needs of our time? Like my college classmate, labyrinth participants report having image-based intuitions which they experience as epiphanies in making sense of their life situations, with a frequency that indicates a connection between the finite, delineated site of the labyrinth and the processes of cognition and creativity. My intention in writing is to render transparent those moments of transformative engagement so that the essential paradox of the labyrinth experience \u2014 a myopic involvement and simultaneous comprehension of the whole \u2014 may be clearly articulated. The importance of maintaining this multiple perspective cannot be overemphasized in a discussion of education with a holistic orientation. The second question asks: (2) What observations from phenomenology and aesthetics can be made of the connections between the practices of labyrinth pilgrimage and the imaginative and integrative processes of participants? After years of watching people play, dance, sing and duet with the labyrinth, in this inquiry I explore, using arts-informed inquiry techniques appropriate to the content, the haptic' aesthetic dimensions of the experience of the labyrinth walk, especially with reference to participatory transformative community practices. The question is asked: (3) How does the labyrinth function to link individual process to communal public art? As I will discuss, the labyrinth originally co-emerged with an institution of higher learning. An underlying objective throughout this study is to note possibilities for a curriculum that, by integrating aesthetics, embodied knowledge, relational complexity, imagination, and spirituality, would honour the spirit of a new School of Chartres. Such a curriculum will articulate the idea of human development productively understood as a journey with mythic dimensions. (Frye, 1963; Greene, 1994, 1995; Huebner, Slattery, & Taubman, 1994). *haptic, adjective: relating to the sense of touch [Late 19th century. From Greek haptikos, from haptesthai \"to grasp, touch,\" from haptein \"to fasten.\"] 3. METHOD The purpose of arts-based inquiry is not to reveal truth or beauty but rather to bridge or bond, promoting individual, social, and political transformation (Diamond & Van Halen-Faber, 2002). This inquiry is divided into two parts, one being a thorough examination of facts relating to the theoretical, historical, mathematical and design context of the cathedral pavement labyrinth, while the other, the \"Labyrinth as Laboratory,\" recounts three narratives of learning. Each of these three essays is anchored in a particular place and time, focuses on a particular topic, and reflects upon a stage of the developmental process in the multiple identities of artist, teacher, student, seeker, and labyrinth scholar, alone and in community with others. This progression parallels an \"archaeological dig\" into the mathematics of origin, an account of a pilgrimage to Chartres Cathedral, and my apprenticeship with the labyrinth in the parish of St. Paul's. These explorations of developmental experience focus on the conditions favouring transformative learning, which the labyrinth provides in its function as site, symbol, and technology, terms I will discuss more fully later on. I have drawn from the literature on labyrinths, pilgrimages, and meditation practices, and previously published and archival material from institutions with labyrinths including hospitals, retreat centres, and churches, to provide context for arts-based interpretations of my experiences as both participant\u2014 in Canada, the US, and Europe\u2014and practitioner. As a facilitator, I have observed participants over five years in a variety of settings, primarily public events in liturgical parish settings, retreats, conferences and workshops. In the capacity of event organizer and service provider my concern focused on creating the optimal settings and rituals for transformative events, basing my choices of lighting, colour, music, atmosphere, and other sensorial and cognitive cues on participants' responses. These included their social and non-verbal behaviour, posture, gesture, breathing, pace, kinaesthetic expansion and contraction, and interaction with others, that is, how people behaved as they arrived and moved around, adjusting to the space, looked about for cues and information, and found ways to make themselves part of a group. I noted the presiding minister or facilitator's choice of words and emphasis in the introduction, and how that set the tone for the encounter. My observations as a 8 participant have been honed by sensitivity developed in the facilitator role. Field notes based on these observations take the form of journal notes collected over the years. The investigation is grounded in hermeneutic aesthetics and phenomenology, using narrative and visual arts-informed Manen, 1997). In the material collected while working as a facilitator, what I looked for were those patterns in both the behaviour and the insights of the participant in the focused and demarcated setting of the labyrinth walk that would illuminate the role of the imagination in conceptualizing and representing interior events. In simplest terms, I was looking for the commonality of experience that is the mark of a phenomenological investigation, what Husserl called \"the essence...the central underlying meaning of the experience and ... the intentionality of consciousness where experiences contain both the outward appearance and inward consciousness based on memory, image, and meaning\" (in Creswell, 1998, p. 52). The invitation to dialogue which the labyrinth extends as a technology for \"inner listening\" here illustrates Husserl's point concerning \"intentionality of consciousness\": one is always conscious of something, there is a mutuality to perception because the \"reality of an object.is inextricably related to one's consciousness of it\" such that what is significant about an object is \"only perceived within the meaning of the experience of an individual\" (Cresswell, 53). This brings to mind how often I have witnessed among participants in the labyrinth an attitude that Davey describes so poignantly as \"the aching sense of searchingness that follows ... after [nJihilism, skepticism and barbaric technologies bereaved us of faith in the possibility of meaning\" (1999, p. 21). This is often expressed as suspicion that they are wasting their time by walking the labyrinth and doubt that they will get anything out of it, followed by gratitude and relief when they do recognize that \"something\" has indeed \"happened.\" \"Something happens\" because labyrinth experience generates intuitive and imaginal thought processes and products, whereby implicit knowledge surfaces to consciousness at a pre-verbal level. The labyrinth pattern functions as an aid to personal development due to this capacity to move the participant into the consciously non-verbal as they are being guided bodily through the walk. The research tool flexible enough to \"capture\" and explore this data, without prematurely assigning fixed meaning to it, is image-based 10 inquiry. The research questions concerned with the connection between labyrinth walking, individual imaginative and integrative processes, and communal public art makes the aesthetics of this transformative moment a focal point. The method I used combines the visual art techniques of collage and water-colour with interrogative and reflective writing, in a back-and-forth movement between image-making and writing similar to the incubation characteristic of labyrinth-generated insight, where meaning arises in the reverberation. (This \"reverberating,\" associative thought process was highly developed in medieval education and is discussed at length in the \"Cathedral\" section of the Laboratory.) In this image-based form of inquiry, I have arranged the visual imagery and text on the pages in the Laboratory section to help convey the experience of walking through a labyrinth, by evoking a place that is both real and symbolic, where \"everything is metaphor.\" Returning to the larger labyrinth of everyday life, the one walking finds it transformed in subtle ways. The essays in the Laboratory communicate this transitional indeterminacy by taking the form of an interwoven text, with three distinct layers moving concurrently, reflexively, and intertextually. These are the narrative text, the visual imagery, and a reflective analysis of the two. This three-layer record of insights, epiphanic moments, convoluted thoughts, layered understandings, fragmentary memories and emergent meanings is first of all a counterpoint response to the pattern of arcs and turns on the clockwise-counterclockwise-clockwise path in towards and back out from the centre, within a complex design that addresses the four cardinal directions and employs a concealed, crystallographic structure.' These layers of structure inform the physical and cognitive journey, illuminating the underlying logic of the labyrinth. I have found Richardson's use of the crystal to illustrate the criterion for validity very helpful for this image-based inquiry form, for two reasons. First, the refracted \"crystalline\" quality of inquiry she outlines'\u00ae is appropriate to the crystallographic \u00b0 The infinite repeat pattern escherized in Rosenstiehl's \"Path to Jerusalem\" (Appendix 8). '\u00b0 that the central image for 'validity' for postmodernist texts is not the triangle\u2014a rigid, fixed, two-dimensional object. Rather, the central image is the crystal, which combines symmetry and substance with an infinite variety of shapes, substances, transmutations, multi-dimensionalities, and angles of approach. Crystals grow, change, alter, but are not amorphous. Crystals are prisms that reflect externalities and refract within themselves, creating different colors, patterns, and arrays, casting off in different directions. What we see depends on our angle of repose\" (Richardson, 2000, p. 934). 1] skeleton of the labyrinth's mathematical origin, which I explore in the Laboratory. Second, the recurring variation in the angle of repose\u2014and approach\u2014for someone walking along the labyrinth path illustrates Richardson's point that multiple perspectives are accessible, even inevitable, in a post-modern text. On the labyrinth path, each step moves within a quadrant towards one of the four cardinal directions of the labyrinth pattern, going away from or towards a deeper or more external view, farther or nearer to the centre. This requires the traveller to alternate all the while between attending carefully to the path on the floor beneath the feet and surveying the entire arena to reorient herself, a complex perceptual experience which as a metaphor encapsulates perfectly the research endeavour. The back-and-forth movement between image-making and writing represents this thought process on paper. To illuminate this parallel between walking and image-based meaning, I will state briefly here my understanding of interpretation in arts-based inquiry. I am making methodological use of hermeneutics in the sense Blumenfeld-Jones defines it, as \"a knowledge generating process... [which] is, simultaneously, a way of experiencing in which experiencing and making sense of experiencing are fused\" (1997, p. 7). It is particularly clear in the use of visual art as a form of inquiry that, as Kincheloe and McLaren suggest, \"perception itself is an act of interpretation\" (2000, p. 285). Indispensable to the \"bridge building\" of arts-based inquiry and to staying \"grounded in a hermeneutical circle ...[that] engages in the back-and-forth of studying parts in relation to the whole and the whole in relation to the parts\" (Kincheloe &McLaren p. 286) is the obligation to provide the reader with a map of the new terrain. While it is fair to say that \"products of art are lived experiences transformed into transcended configurations\" (Van Manen, 1997, p. 74)\u2014 and sometimes, conversely, transcendent experiences translated with some difficulty and through several intermediary stages into languages which have no words for them''\u2014nevertheless \"' Langer says \"the philosopher must know the arts, so to speak, 'from the inside.' This entails an arduous amount of non-academic study. His teachers, furthermore, are artists, and they speak their own language, which largely resists translation into the more careful, literal vocabulary of philosophy. This is likely to arouse his impatience. But it is, in fact, impossible to talk about art without adopting to some extent the language of the artists. The reason why they talk as they do is not entirely (though it is partly) that they are discursively untrained and popular in their speech; nor do they, misled by \"bad speech habits' accept a 'ghost in the machine' view of man, as Gilbert Ryle holds. Their vocabulary is metaphorical 12 \"transforming the contents of consciousness into a public form so that they can be stabilized, inspected, edited, and shared with others\" (Eisner, 1993, p.6) is a process that tends to be most productive when the artist explains the interpretive code, like a Translator's Note tacked onto a text.' The Laboratory includes therefore both a coding chart for the artworks and, within the essays, discussions of the content and meaning of the images, and in some cases, the way they arrived. The \"empty\" labyrinth is the research site, and the data is the imaginal material generated there by and out of the imagination and memory of the participants (mine included). A multiplicity of selves, stories, and voices, my own and others', in the moment and historically, are moving through this inquiry space. The codes of meaning for colour, iconography, genre and personae are introduced, yet a certain ambiguity necessarily prevails. One is not alone, here: the reader brings along his and her own \"others,\" \"grandfathers who came in with us,\" associations of candlelight, mathematical puzzles, pastries and cathedrals. (Mine are represented in the multitudes of footnotes and appendices, an effort to keep down the Derridean din of \"How about me?\" See Alternate interpretations remain uninvoked, p. 191) Every writer is also a researcher/maze-treader, artisan/maze-maker, and entangler of others (if they are willing) in the text (Doob, p.xii). When I find myself entangled in the labyrinth of material, drawn towards yet doubtful of the existence of the centre with its promise of a mystery revealed, then the need for an overview\u2014 felt like a thread snagging\u2014 signals the alternating cycle of movement and re-orientation, myopia and overview, within the emerging pattern. The technique of collage plus dialogue \"conversation with the data\" approach is a method of creating and interrogating an inquiry piece to access and articulate perception, memory, insight and feeling states (see Appendix 3: Artist's statement). These \"image because it has to be plastic and powerful enough to let them speak their serious and often difficult thoughts. They cannot see art as 'merely' this-or-that easily comprehensible phenomenon; they are too interested in it to make concessions to language\" (1953 p. ix-x). \" Similarly, it is always interesting to walk through an exhibition alongside the artist, hearing about the sequence of creation and the reasoning behind this or that direction taken in the work. A book such as Hockney on Photography (1988) not only gives a sense of the restless brilliance of the man's mind, but opens up the viewer's understanding of the evolutionary leaps Hockney made with, for example, his \"joiner\" series. 13 inquiries,\" explorations in the form of more complex, layered pieces, anchor sections and chapters. (The originals are generally 8x10 inch format, in colour, for ease of reproduction.) Marginalia in the Medieval style provides an inclusive platform for parallel thought processes. Here are incorporated graphic elements based on the various historical forms of labyrinth patterns, on representations of states of walking reverie, inner landscapes and pathways, and personae. Three stages of the \"walk\" that have emerged in images are the anticipation/dread of the unknown at the entrance (A Janus sort of gargoyle guardian character figures here) and the undertaking of the journey; the embrace and illumination at the centre (the coils of Mother architecture; a binary sense of Home/Desolation); the return to the World (pathway back from inner landscape to the erstwhile familiar outer one). The theme is the movement from the ambiguity of not knowing\u2014aporia\u2014to the state of commitment to a particular direction, one step at a time. The pictures are fragmentary psychological landscapes peopled and furnished with quest archetypes and pilgrimage genre companions. The idea is to sustain and refer to several perceptual levels at once in each picture\u2014 an awareness of the feet moving on any particular section of the labyrinth path, the evoked memory fragment, the associated images gathering along the torn edges\u2014to construct the momentary point of narrative. A unifying theme has been the central informing image of the labyrinth, that of alternation by Caputo as \"uncanny, mysterious in an unsettling way; devoid of the comforts of home\" (1987, p.269)\u2014at play for both seekers and labyrinth-keepers, evoking associations with paradise, expulsion and return; the archetypes, in architectural form, of the Great Mother and the Heroic Quest; the movement from darkness to light, with its related emphasis on the faculties of hearing and touch during the passage through darkness; the generative ontologies of absence, of eros and longing (Miller, 2000, p.32). This binary theme brings to the foreground the inquiry's stated objective of understanding human development as a journey with mythic dimensions. 14 The evaluative criteria identified as appropriate to arts-based inquiry (Cole & Knowles, 2001}\u2014authenticity, resonance, and verisimilitude in representation, coherence of means and content, and accessibility of the text to the reader\u2014 have served as guidelines in this creation. But Lather's concept of catalytic validity has been the real driving force: Catalytic validity represents the degree to which the research process re- orients, focuses and energizes participants toward knowing reality in order to transform it (Kincheloe & McLaren, p. 297). The argument for catalytic validity lies not only within recognition of the reality-altering impact of the research process, but also in the desire to consciously channel this impact so that respondents gain self- understanding and, ultimately, self-determination through research participation. (Lather, 1991 p. 68) When I first began, I was astounded at how profoundly the labyrinth was changing my life, bringing people into my path, taking me places I never would have predicted. I wrote, \"My intention in this thesis is to provide so evocative an account of the journey I have traveled on/in/with/through the labyrinth that readers are moved to find the nearest one and experience it themselves. I want it to change lives and perceptions. I want it to be readable, impossible to put down, and so beautiful to look at and hold that everyone will rush back to their workshops to paint, dance, sing, write, compose and in so doing, to respond. I want to look at it years from now and still be surprised.\" 4.THEORETICAL ORIENTATION Transformative learning For the purposes of this inquiry into the function of the labyrinth, the most applicable theoretical framework is that of transformative learning theory, which posits that to transcend a familiar, internalized, but no longer viable schematic requires a profound disruption to points of view and habits of mind, usually brought about through a disorienting dilemma, influence, or event. This turning point marks a transitional stage of dislocation while the understanding of experience is re-organised to accommodate the new information. With critical reflection, this process, \"a movement through time of reforming reified structures of meaning by reconstructing dominant narratives\" (Mezirow, 2000, p. 6) re-establishes in the learner a coherent sense of self, one's purpose in life and connection to the world. The reflexivity in this sequence recalls van Gennep's three part structure of ritual, identified as separation, limen, and re-aggregation, whereby \"a group or community seeks to portray, understand, and then act on itself\" (Turner, 1979, p.94). Transformative learning, similarly, always involves an epistemological change (Kegan, 2000); if our disconnect is more than intellectual, it cannot adequately be addressed by rational means alone (as Einstein has pointed out), but requires a conversion in our ways of knowing. Even a voluntary sojourn in the unknown is likely to be emotionally trying and spiritually bleak at times. Yet this is the familiar pattern of the heroic quest, a metaphor for the transitional stages of human development for the species as well as the individual. The precedents for procedural cues exist in many cultural images, especially the familiar and accessible mythological and literary forms. These generally feature some version of a safe place of containment and protection, or temenos, for the sometimes frightening liminal stages The labyrinth in its many variants provides such an environment. The decisive acts of turning away from and turning towards are repeated throughout the labyrinth walk, constituting by a choreography whose aesthetic form reveals layers of embodied, experiential, integrated implications for meaning. To do this mindfully, to discern and 15 16 articulate at each reversal what one is turning away from and leaving behind, and what one is turning towards, is considered to be among the most productive meditations in labyrinth practice. So well designed is this ancient pattern for the process of transformative learning that, although its origins are mysterious, it is difficult to imagine what else it could possibly have been intended for. The blueprint we use for this arrangement of lines\u2014of exotic provenance and fragmented pedigree, elegant appearance, profound and unpredictable effect\u2014is the fruit of someone's thinking, but we do not know whose, or what they intended. Mystery. When, in a labyrinth, something happens \"by grace of our embodiment,\" in Levin's lovely phrase (1989, p.55) to shift boundaries in categories of thought, expanding perception, triggering an emotional response, sparking the imagination, can we suppose that this was the designers' objective? Based on what we know of medieval art and architecture, culture and education, we can speculate on the worldview of the original builders. But we do so from the utilitarian, paved side of the Enlightenment project, part way up the next evolutionary mountain range (although perhaps it is a slow slide, or even a desperate teetering at the brink of an extinctual abyss). I will state here a few words with regard to my own horizon. I am an educator- researcher working in the context of aesthetic and holistic practices, intent on creating the conditions of transformative education such that eco-cosmological values of sustainable community life might prevail in our time. To that end I believe it is critical to articulate conscientiously the experience of lived-through multi-perspectivalism during this difficult transition to a new paradigm. Examining these three influences\u2014 aesthetics, holism, and the transformative\u2014highlights, in the domain of aesthetics, the central features of incarnation, imagination, and the relational\u2014a reality captured in Blumenfeld- Jones's observation that \"living aesthetically is an active participation in the world through one's senses, the outcome of such engagement being unknowable beforehand, but having a profound effect on one's sense of place and value in the world (1997, p.3). The defining principles of holistic practice\u2014 connectivity, balance, and inclusivity (Miller, 1996)\u2014 are in harmony with and sustain the tenets of transformative eco- cosmology: differentiation, subjectivity, and communion (Berry, 1999, p. 162; O'Sullivan, 1999). Each theoretical orientation with its set of views and practices, 17 supports the others. In a crystal-as-\"loom-of-the-gods\" crossing metaphor, these principles run like weft threads throughout this writing, varying in colour, texture, and density as they move across the warp of narrative, imagery and reflective text. In this way, theory and method merge. Discussion of Terms I am now going to explain the terms in the thesis title, Understanding the Labyrinth as site, symbol, and technology of transformation: An arts-informed inquiry. This definition of terms, for the purpose of discussion, sets the parameters of the study, which is not about the literary labyrinth, nor the hedge kind. Those are both mazes. Technically a maze is a multi-cursal spatial puzzle, of interest to rational problem-solvers.\" Notwithstanding the popular conflation in the English language of the two terms, the labyrinth that I am referring to here is a concentric arrangement of circuitous lines designed to create a unicursal path with a single decision point, leading from the entrance to a central goal, filling completely a finite space in which processes and events of a specific kind tend to and may be intended to occur. I would particularly direct the reader's attention to the discussion of \"technology.\" Notice your response when you realize it is not about electronic information communication hardware. Imagine what the atmosphere might be like in a schoo! that had, as integral to its layout as the computer lab, a site dedicated to restoring balance, equanimity, insight, and wholeness. Site In this context, a site is a place, actual and/or virtual, geographical, or social, with qualities that engender poiesis, which, Heidegger tells us, According to Jeff Saward, editor of Caerdroia and the acknowledged expert in the field, \"in the English-speaking world it is often considered that to qualify as a maze, a design must have choices in the pathway,\" although as he points out, the line gets blurry, even if the intention may be clear. His excellent website includes a classification system for both labyrinths and mazes, and a great deal more: www.labyrinthos.net/f_homepage.htm. Adrian Fisher, founder of Minotaur Designs, creates and installs large public labyrinths and mazes. His publications and website provide information on maze theory: www.mazemaker.com/mzetypes.htm. A website focused on the mathematics of maze theory accessible for those of us whose gifts lie elsewhere can be found here: http://plus.maths.org/issue14/features/budd/. Accessed 5/3 1/2006 18 brings what presences into appearance. Plato tells us what this bringing is in a sentence from the Symposium (205b): \"Every occasion for whatever passes over and goes forward into presencing from that which is not presencing is poiesis, is bringing forth.\" Not only ... artistic and poetical bringing into appearance and concrete imagery is a bringing-forth, poiesis. Physis also, the arising of something out of itself, is a poiesis ... in the highest sense, the bringing forth in itself (en heautoi), in contrast to the bringing forth in another (en alloi), in the artist (1977, pp. 9-11). The fecundity of the labyrinth as such a site suggests an interpenetration of place and participant consciousness. Though we know nothing of the intentions of its original designers, they were familiar with such a process in their own lives. St Augustine's famous comment, Solvitur ambulando\u2014 \"It is solved by walking'\"\u2014 outlines the interaction with an admirable economy of means. To honour the relationship between walking and narrative, place and identity, to attend to the significance of each \"presencing\" that we may witness or undergo, \"each one of us, then, should speak of his roads, his crossroads, his roadside benches; each one of us should make a surveyor's map of his lost fields and meadows...Thus we cover the universe with drawings we have lived\" (Bachelard, 1994, pp. 11-12). This stance with respect to place is reflected in the co-evolutionary term \"vacant ecology,\" which refers to open niches in the environment where new forms can find their footing, a concept which can be applied to receptivity of consciousness, the inner environment (Dwyer, 1999). Indeed, Rosenstiehl says of the labyrinth that \"Its role is to serve for everyone as a geometry of welcome for spatial visions upon their spiritual pathways\" (1982, p. 787).\" Symbol The symbol is a sign, (a mark, glyph, image, colour, gesture, sound) which arbitrarily or by convention points to something beyond itself. 1. oUpBodov mark, token, ticket, \"tessera\" \"a throw\") 14 n ey r tat ap R os : . \u00ab son r\u00e9le est de servir a chacun d'accueil a des visions spatiales sur les cheminement de son esprit. \u00bb My translation. 19 2. Something that stands for, represents, or denotes something else (not by exact resemblance but by vague suggestion, or by some accidental or conventional relation); especially a material object representing or taken to represent something immaterial or abstract, as a being, idea, quality, or condition; a representative or typical figure, sign, or token. 3. A written character or mark used to represent something; a letter, figure, or sign conventionally for some object, process, etc. (OED, 1971) \"Symbols are not proxies for their objects but are vehicles for the conception of objects... In talking about things we have conceptions of them, not the things themselves; and it is the conceptions, not the things, that symbols directly 'mean'\" (Langer, 1979, pp. 60-61. Emphasis in the original). While asserting that a symbol is \"any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction\" (1953, p.x), Langer contrasts the place of abstraction in the realms of discursive thinking\u2014that is, in logic, mathematics and the sciences\u2014 where abstraction is reached through a process of generalization, \"letting the concrete, directly known thing stand for all things of its kind,\" with abstraction in art, which \"does not generalize. Symbolic form, symbolic function, and symbolized import are all telescoped into one experience, a perception of beauty and an intuition of significance\" (1957, pp. 33-34). Between the experiential and the mathematical labyrinth it could be argued that abstraction functions in both the capacities that Langer outlines. In Jungian terminology, the natural symbol originates from the content of the collective unconscious, which is made up essentially of pre-existent forms that have never been in consciousness, the archetypes. These natural symbols can still be traced back to their archaic roots in the most ancient records and in primitive societies (Jung, 1968, p. 83). In Jung's view, \"the archetypes are the unconscious image of the instincts themselves, in other words... they are patterns of instinctual behaviour...the forms which the instincts assume\" (1971a, p. 60-1). Cultural symbols, on the other hand, are collective images \"more or less consciously developed,\" and widely accepted by civilised societies as expressions of eternal truths. These cultural symbols continue to evoke strong emotional response in individuals and groups, and are essential components in the construction of individual and social identity (1968, p. 83). Here again, the labyrinth has characteristics of both types of symbol. It is this multiplicity of referents, that to which 20 the labyrinth-as-symbol points, and their often contradictory nature, which provides the labyrinth with its compelling quality. Technology The term technology is derived from fechn\u00e9, \"the name not only for the activities and skills of the craftsman, but also for the arts of the mind and the fine arts...a mode of revealing, a bringing-forth, a poiesis\"'' (Heidegger, 1977, p. 14). Franklin's definition of technology-as-practice considers the social impact: \"the organization of work and people\" refers to \"ways of doing something...socially accepted practices;\" as a \"system, ...technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset\" (Franklin, 1990, pp.12, 15). This would include social and spatial organisation. Franklin argues that technology needs to be understood in its particular settings, because the interrelatedness among \"knowledge, activity, structure and the act of structuring\" is complex, and in a humanistic view, \"context is what matters most.\" This concern with the accommodation human beings make to the system of technology that they have created, and the pervasiveness of that system, recalls Ellul's sociological perspective on what he calls Technique, the system as distinct from the machine (1964, p. x).'\u00b0 The relevance of this definition to my use of the word is in the fact of accommodation, the lived experience of accommodation. This dynamic is reflected in the McLuhans' First Law of Media, that of extension/enhancement: \"Every technology extends or amplifies some organ or faculty of the user. What does the medium enhance or intensify?\" (McLuhan & McLuhan, 1988) The question guides the phenomenological interrogation of the labyrinth experience. In my inquiry into the felos of the labyrinth, its characteristics as a specifically pre- Modern form of technology are taken into account. According to economic theorist and historian Jacques Attali, the labyrinth acts on participants as a mnemonic code for re- activating non-linear processing and networking modes of thinking (1999). In this way it counteracts the effects that the technologies of Cartesian optics, perspectivalism, and 15 =; : . From Greek poi\u00e9sis, creation, from poiein, to make 16 \"Technique\" which his translator understands as \"the universal and autonomous fact, is revealed as the technological society itself in which man is but a single tightly integrated and articulated component.\" 21 print culture has had on us (Gablik, 1991; Levin, 1989; Lowe, 1982; Romanyshyn, 1989). Levin is clear on this (pp. 11-12): Much can be said of the ontology of Cartesian thought. Its self-grounding self-assurance generated a method which freed us from dogmatic authority, and even its mechanistic picture of Man and world, without which the physical sciences and the sciences of Man could not have advanced, should forever deserve our admiration. But this metaphysics of isolated subjects and objects bequeathed us a Self locked into a world of self-defeating, virtually Schizophrenic dualisms. In this sense the labyrinth may be considered as an aid to reflective introspection, one of the \"technologies of the self\" according to Foucault's definition (1988, p.18): each a matrix of practical reason...which permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality. Transformative A descriptor for an event or influence which precipitates the experience of a deep, structural shift in basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions, a shift of consciousness that radically alters our way of being in the world and our sense of possibility (O'Sullivan, 1999). Such experiences can be developmental turning points or epiphanies in understanding. Grabove reminds us that \"not all change is transformative and not all critical reflection leads to transformative learning... Transformative learning cannot be taught; it is the learner who experiences transformative learning\" (1997, p.90). Arts-informed inquiry & Mullen, 1999) foregrounds the perceptual and hermeneutic practices of visual, tactile and performing art traditions so as to access, address, record, interpret, and present human experience more inclusively than normally possible through discipline-based social science research discourse. 5. LITERATURE REVIEW A Google foray into the World Wide Web, or a search of library holdings or research journal databases, using the search term \"labyrinth,\" will quickly turn into a tangled skein of threads, with loose ends poking out of areas and disciplines from ear canals to search algorithms, linguistics to romantic obsession, international diplomacy to literary criticism, Liebniz to Borges, related only by the theme of confusion and the image of the tortuous. While this is certainly evidence of the persistent linguistic confusion between the terms labyrinth and maze, and of the underlying function of the labyrinth as organizing principle discernible beneath apparent chaos, I have nevertheless limited the focus of my literature review to four distinct areas. One major area concerns the actual unicursal labyrinth pattern as an historical object, as a mathematically significant diagram, and as the physical site for applied practice. This material may be found elsewhere in the text, in the section called \"Understanding the Labyrinth.\" The other three areas illuminated the theoretical context for this study. The first area pertained to the labyrinth's function as a cognitive \"incubator\" for the imagination, without which nothing else would unfold. A second area outlined claims concerning the labyrinth traverse itself as a cue for thinking reflectively about it as metaphorical journey, thereby supporting the idea of the labyrinth as a site for human developmental process. The third area, in consideration of the connection of the Jabyrinth experience to curriculum as an aesthetic project , delved into the labyrinth site as public sacred art, identifying participant response as an aesthetic one. Finally, I have gathered reports of the work other facilitators and investigators are doing in their schools and institutions, as a fieldwork review. My contribution to the literature My thesis provides a layered interdisciplinary inquiry into an aesthetic and transpersonal engagement with the labyrinth, documenting its multiple functions as incubator of the imagination, transformative technology, and generative symbol system, while examining the experiential learning that takes place as the labyrinth walker negotiates the elements 22 23 of the I/Thou relationship vis-a-vis bounded but permeable sacred space, and interactive public artwork. I do this by synthesizing multiple viewpoints and weaving practitioners' and participants' narratives through the aesthetic, historical, philosophical, and theoretical frameworks represented by the bibliographic sources collected here. In my thesis I foreground the importance of the labyrinth's origins in pre-Cartesian cosmological philosophy for its current function, in order to show what an impact such an \"ancestral artefact\" can have on transforming our thought processes, perceptions, sense of self and community during this historical period of evolutionary upheaval. The labyrinth's capacity for restoring integrity and maintaining equilibrium during times of transition has particular impact in the areas of cognitive development, conflict resolution, personal and community healing. I make the case that this transformative tool therefore has profound implications for any contemporary educational initiative concerned with the integrity of the imagination and of the person within a holistic context. I emphasize the significance of the worldview and mentality of the original designers because I found that we have much in common, and I had a great desire to fully appreciate both the gifts and the lessons they had left us. To understand what the medieval designers were thinking and how they perceived the world required some familiarity with social history of the Middle Ages during the extraordinarily active period of cathedral construction at the end of the 12th century in France, and the relationship between faith, image, and architecture. (Favier, James, & Flamand, 1990; Katzenellenbogen, 1964). Receptivity to the possibility of alternate and/or transpersonal states of consciousness as pathways to the evolutionary next step is desirable, although I may not knowingly have experienced these states personally. Still, there is sometimes an unfounded quality about new forms of ritual, including labyrinth practice (or perhaps certain practitioners: is it a personal message from Trickster? Or could it just be a crow cawing on a fence post?). This recalls those aspects of medieval life upon which the Renaissance casts a revealing light: \"the spirit of the Middle Ages, still plastic and naive, longs to give concrete shape to every conception. Every thought seeks expression as an image, but in this image it solidifies and becomes rigid\" (Huizinga, 1954, pp. 152). A sense of the Medieval intellectual milieu furnished some perspective on my experiences. 24 Of particular interest is the question of what the medieval designers might have been seeing and thinking, and in what ways their sense perception and understanding of reality, given the influence of visual linear perspective, might differ from contemporary Western perception. I have relied on Lowe's account of the development of perception (1982) and Romanyshyn (1989) on the influence upon consciousness of technological factors, for this section. A theory of the labyrinth as a post-Cartesian remedial technology (remedial in the sense of restorative, as meditation restores a jangled contemporary mind to its original state of calm and balance) rests in part on the labyrinth's qualities as a product of a pre-Cartesian mind (Huizinga, 1954; Ong, 1977). Of interest therefore is our third millenium attraction to this extension of such a mind. McLuhanist scholar Derrick de Kerckhove has suggested that we are entering a new Renaissance era, a parallel that highlights the function of the labyrinth as perceptual transformer (1995). Imagination: labyrinth as cognitive incubator Imagination as educational concern Progressive education values the cultivation of the imagination (Frye, 1963, 1988; Greene, 1991, 1994, 1995; Griffin, 1996; Jardine, Pinar et al., 1994; Willis & Schubert, 1991). Frye describes imagination as \"the power of constructing possible models of human experience\" (1963, p. 5), but distinguishes between \"the world of imagination and the world of belief and action. The first [is] a vision of possibilities, which expands the horizon of belief and makes it both more tolerant and more efficient (p. 55).\" Greene also uses a spatial image, the \"space of freedom\" opening up for one who can feel the \"becoming different\"\u2014becoming an agent\u2014 that the learning process entails. This sense of possibility made available by the imagination links with civic \"response-ability\" through the aesthetic experience of compassion discussed earlier. Characteristic of the labyrinth experience is the stimulation and response of the imagination during and after the experience. The labyrinth, following Vichian thinking on iconicity in the dialogue between fantasia and ingegno, is a thought made external, a mental fossil of the people who made it. Danesi on Euclidean geometry \u2014\"a perfect combination of art and language\" (1993, p. 102)\u2014\u2014 and Mach on spatial conceptualisation \u2014 \"our notions of space, as idealized by geometry, are rooted in our physiological selves, 25 in our bodily experiences and perceptions. They are not out there in any objective sense\" (in Danesi, p. 102), enabled me to think about imagination itself, as a faculty which has, at some point in the past, generated the labyrinth, and now wanted to play with it. Warnock suggests this sense of the imagination wanting to \"render our experience unfamiliar and mysterious. If, below the level of consciousness, our imagination is at work tidying up the chaos of sense experience, at a different level, it may, as it were, untidy it again\" (1978, p. 207). \"The soul speaks in images,\" says St. Augustine. Products of the imagination arrive as intuitive, unmediated, non-rational totalities, full-blown intuition described as \"both thoughtless and also not a feeling state\" (Hillman, 1996, p. 97). Artress cautions, \"it is not wise to take our imagination literally. The symbols and images that appear should be opened and reflected upon. And we have yet to sort out the difference between magical thinking and mystical experience\" (1995, p. 117).The labyrinth experience is a fine opportunity to recognise the truths of meditation traditions: one has feelings, but one is not only one's feelings; one has thoughts, but consciousness is not limited to one's thoughts. Nevertheless, these non-thought, non-feeling entities are powerful when they arrive, often as clear voices, fragments of music, evocative memory fragments. Kearney's lament, that \"we appear to have entered a post-modern civilisation where the image has become less and less the expression of an individual subject and more and more the commodity of an anonymous consumerist technology\" (1988, p. 6) is a widely held view (Benjamin, 1968; Griffin, 1996; Horkheimer & Adorno, 1982). The \"seekingness\" of the imagination, in Warnock's precise description, without which, \"even at the quite human level of there being something which deeply absorbs our interest, human life becomes perhaps not actually futile or pointless, but experienced as if it were\" (p. 202), is sidetracked into acquisitions, with inevitable dissatisfaction and feelings of futility. Developmental process: labyrinth walk as journey as metaphor of life Penelope Doob provides authoritative and exhaustive accounts of every labyrinth installation, graphic, and image in every possible material, supported by the subtlest, most precisely delineated theory imaginable, in her scholarly and collegial book, The idea of the labyrinth. Her research in the areas of medieval literature and dance is essential, as extant records of the Chartres development (though not the explanation) lie in the 26 margins of monastery manuscripts, and in parish records of liturgical and musical services. Her identification of a labyrinthine aesthetic, which she identifies with the medieval poetic form known as \"interlacing,\" is concise and evocative. Hers too is the working image of the double perspective: chaos from within, perfect order from without, an image which informs her method as she comments frequently on the trials of labyrinthine research as if to another pilgrim on a difficult path (Doob, 1990). The idea that labyrinth walking (and thinking) has a distinct aesthetic and that it promotes being simultaneously \"'bi-focal\" or multi-perspectival contributed to my understanding of labyrinth related cognition. Applied practice Many of the people I met in the facilitator-training program were denominational ministers or spiritual directors or psychotherapists or counsellors of some kind. Some were in private practice, some had congregations, others were volunteers within church communities. Artress' original introduction was through a Mystery School run by Jean Houston, a cultural historian, behavioral scientist, philosopher, educator and scholar in the Human Potential movement. For most practitioners, the labyrinth is one of several techniques in their repertoire. Artress's was the first book to relate the labyrinth specifically to spiritual development. Melissa Gayle West, a psychotherapist in private practice, emphasizes psychotherapeutic practice in her book, but includes an extensive section on designing and building labyrinths, and, recalling the Benedictine laborare est orare, the spiritual benefits of maintaining them. Helen Post Curry, co-founder of The Labyrinth Society, is an interdenominational minister, reiki master, and meditation teacher; her book is attentive to each stage of the meditation process, and includes plans, blessings, and prayers for several kinds of rituals and ceremonies \u2014an operating manual for \"technology of prayer\" (Artress, 1995; Curry, 2000; West, 2000). Meditation and inner journey Meditation practice has deep roots in several cultures. Besides transcendental meditation of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi form, and Zazen, there is a tradition of Christian contemplative practice, and many forms of Buddhist practice. Daniel Goleman provides with extraordinary precision the subtle distinctions in the range of known techniques and 27 the detailed physiological account of what the meditating mind and body experience (Goleman, 1989). Roger Housden examines a wide variety of spiritual retreats, not all of them geographical, and introduces Western as well as Eastern forms of meditation. The practitioners he interviews articulate the differences between Christian prayer, contemplation, and meditation, and between Christian and non-Christian forms of meditation (1995, p. 90): the distinction between effort and surrender is a subtle one. Both are required in any spiritual practice and it is how the emphasis is placed and the disposition of the individual practitioner which characterizes a particular path. ... two distinct practices, according to one's nature: the way of rigorous self-inquiry, using the koan \"Who Am I?\" or complete surrender of all responsibility for one's life to God... both lead to the same end and the latter is the Christian ideal. He introduces the reader to some unusual particularly inspiring individuals including a woman who runs painting-as-meditation retreats which make central the connection between spiritual practice and creativity (1995, pp. 147-149). In looking for traditions of meditation that include physical movement, in the form of mindfulness practice, almost any activity can be considered a form of meditation. There is even a theory of colouring as meditation.'' The distinction between the activities of prayer, contemplation, and meditation can be said to arise out of differences of intention, sense of seeking and of being in dialogue, and of degrees of awareness of oneself as agent, separate, or as non- distinct (Miller, 1994, 2000). In this context the labyrinth is a form of heightened \"listening\" in Levin's sense (1989), which would position the walker and labyrinth in a dialectical mode, a point I will expand on later. Culture expectations come into play here. Klein makes a telling comparison between the isolation of secular, single Westerners, wrenchingly lonely in their apartments in a new city, and the networks of support that a Tibetan in an extended meditation retreat could rely upon, including not only the people discreetly leaving supplies and food in support of the retreat, but also the non-visible \"It is based on the idea of attending to the inner dialogue, or Vygotskyan self-talk, while colouring mandalas. http://www.coloringtherapy.com/ct_3_steps.htm. Accessed 6/12/06. 28 entities and ancestors keeping her company in existential dimensions of which the Westerners were utterly bereft (1995).\"* Pilgrimage as dedicated ritual journey Pilgrimage is replacing tourism as a category of mass, intentional travel (Homo Turisticus Religiosus).'\u00b0 Leaving familiar terrain for purposeful journeys to specific significant destinations, crossing boundary lines and entering transitional states, in the end to return, subtly and deeply changed, are \"markings\" of ritual passage in all cultures in some form (Grimes, 1982; Turner, 1974, 1994). Of Christian pilgrimage, Victor Turner says, \"All sites of pilgrimage have this in common: they are believed to be places where miracles once happened, still happen, and may happen again\" (in Solnit, 2000, p. 50). Solnit draws the close parallels between walking and thought, journeying and narrative: \"we tend to imagine life as a journey, and going on an actual expedition takes hold of that image and makes it concrete, acts it out with the body and the imagination in a world whose geography has become spiritualized\" (p. 50). The intention of the traveller recasts every detail of the terrain, charging each event along the way with significance. Cousineau's book constitutes a kind of manual for making all travel sacred, based on the idea that making a pilgrimage is \"a way to find answers to your deepest questions\" (1998, p. xvii). Formulating such questions may both indicate readiness for and propel one into that state of receptivity to synchronicity so characteristic of liminality. He quotes Basho about the heightened sensitivity that captures \"'a glimpse of the underglimmer,\" what Cousineau calls \"the deeply real that lurks everywhere beneath centuries of stereotypes and false images that prevent us from truly seeing.\" The idea that pilgrimage can be defined in part by the effort required to reach the destination provides poet David Whyte with another way to gauge the meaning of work: \"to make a pilgrimage of our labours, to understand that the consummation of work lies not only in what we have done '8 See especially Chapter 2. \"\u00b0 See for example Vukonic, B. (1996). Tourism and Religion. New York: Pergamon, on the touristic determinants of pilgrimages, from the perspectives of sociology, economics, and anthropology; and Swatos, W. H. and Tomasi, L. (eds.) (2002). From Medieval Pilgrimage to Religious Tourism: The Social and Cultural Economics of Piety. Westport, CT: Praeger, comprised of proceedings from a sociology conference on religious tourism. As a number of its contributing authors point out, the line between the two is increasingly difficult to decipher and may shift back and forth in the space of a single journey. Included are discussions of the contemporary phenomenon of Pagan pilgrimages. 29 but who we have become while accomplishing the task\" (2001, p. 5). Cousineau, Solnit, and Whyte all make a point of the pilgrim experiencing a felt sense of belonging to a much larger story than the small individual one we each plod through every day. This is profoundly important in the educational context, as young people seek to find their place in this world. The mythopoetic dimension Jean Shinoda Bolen, quoting Dante\u2014\"In the mid-path of my life, I woke to find myself in a dark wood''\u2014 describes being in the forest as \"mid-life landscape,\" a time of leaving the familiar and permanent for a sojourn in the unknown. She sees the labyrinth experience as time \"in the forest\": \"the pattern of entering, getting to the centre, and coming out is a map of the psychological process: shedding, finding, and integrating\" (1994, p. 163). Many writers address the mythic and poetic dimensions of the transitional stages. After the experience with my colleague, I no longer think this is merely a figure of speech. As O'Flaherty observes, \"mythical patterns lay hold on us when our passions reach the spot at which the myth originally asserted itself\" (1988, p.159). Both Bolen and Hillman describe this moment of resonating with a mythic character or pattern as a flash of insight. Connecting the authenticity of narrative with the universality underlying myth creates a powerful moment: \"The relevance of a myth to life strikes like a revelation or a self-evident proposition, which cannot be demonstrated by logic or induced from factual evidence. The best evidence is anecdotal, the telling example that lights up an obscure idea in a clear intuitive flash\" (Hillman, 1996, p. 100). Bolen describes the effect of recognition on clients very like what happened to my colleague: \"When someone has an 'Aha!' response to an interpretation of a myth, the particular myth is symbolically addressing something that is personally important to him or her. The person now grasps something and sees through to a truth\" (1984, p. 6). To recognise and access these mythic patterns and activate them in one's own life is a powerful tool, opening up the possibility of moderating personal transitions within the pattern's form (Assagioli, 1996; Miller et al., 1990). Jungian depth psychology is a useful approach, with a well-developed vocabulary of archetypes and mythic scenarios, including the central figures of the hero Theseus and the Minotaur, the guide Ariadne, 30 and fascinating secondary possibilities suggested by the figures of Minos the judge and rejecting father, Pasiphae the ambivalent mother, and the ethically flexible engineer and industrial designer Daedalus (Jung, 1971b; Woodman, 1990; Woodman & Dickson, 1996). Barry provides a useful symbolic constructivist framework to describe the dynamics of a transitional state of \"symbolic liminality,\" where \"people are willing to be more symbolically adventurous if (a) the area being questioned is somehow bounded and (b) a requisite amount of symbolic fixity exists\" (1996). The use of metaphor provides stability in one area, while flux goes on in another. Thus the labyrinth provides the security of a bounded, if complicated, path to follow, while the participant plays with possible meaning in all the changes of direction, distance from the centre, and apparent confusion. Activating an archetype opens up a hermeneutical reading of interior dialogues with one's projections into literary characters (as McIntyre (2001) does with Anne of Green Gables in a therapeutic context), or manifestations of gods and goddesses and mythological characters (Bolen, 1984; O'Flaherty, 1988; Watkins, 2000). Aesthetics: labyrinth site as public sacred art The response of a viewer or participant to the sight of the labyrinth and the experience of walking it is an aesthetic, embodied one. It has been fruitful to think of the labyrinth therefore as public art, and to investigate it further as public sacred art. As an artistic form, its content is its \"import\" which serves its purpose as a symbol to \"convey the elusive and yet familiar patterns of sentience.\" Langer says of symbolic import that it \"permeates the whole structure, because every articulation of that structure is an articulation of the idea it conveys\" (1953, p. 52). Similarly, Arnheim observes the cognitive tendency towards a Gestalt, in language that illuminates the binary nature of the labyrinth: \"Vision is not a mechanical recording of elements but rather the apprehension of significant structural patterns\" along what he calls axes of the skeletal structure: these are \"the primary data of perception, not the individual details.\" Though the skeleton comprises the elegant cross, graceful quadrants, and illuminated central rosette visible to the onlooker, \"Simplicity ... measured in terms of structural features, not in terms of number of elements or patterns... requires a correspondence in structure between 31 meaning and tangible pattern\" (Arnheim, 1954), which would rather depend on whether one were lost in the coils or soaring overhead. Multiple perspectives; aesthetics of compassion, connective aesthetics Along with the anonymity of the medieval sculptor, mentioned earlier, I looked for ways to displace myself from familiar identifications and subjectivities, so that the data generated in the disruption of the labyrinth-as-liminal place might be more productive. Attending to the various shifts and movements of energy I perceived within myself and amongst the group in the labyrinth was made easier with Deleuze and Guattari's concept of becoming-minoritarian and specifically, becoming-animal, as I understood it in Baker (2000, pp. 102-104). Langer has said that artists speak poetically, in metaphor, \u2014''which largely resists translation into the more careful, literal vocabulary of philosophy\"\u2014 because \"it has to be plastic and powerful enough to let them speak their serious and often difficult thoughts... they cannot see art as 'merely' this-or-that easily comprehensible phenomenon; they are too interested in it to make concessions to language\" (1953, p. x). Becoming-animal similarly evades the imposition of meaning: if I feel like a horse on the long double arcs on the eastern side, I wanted to explore that impulse drive, not begin psychoanalyzing what it might represent. Equally radical, Gablik's systematic critique of Modernism, the stultifying dominance of the Western art canon, the impotence of art-making within the grant and gallery system, and the limits of spectatorialism has as its re-constructive next step a development of an aesthetics of compassion and relation that is aligned with holistic practice and deep ecological awareness (1991; 1993). Haptic and relational embodied aesthetics Because so much of what is at play in the labyrinth experience is concerned with receptivity towards the presence of the unknown (the Other\u2014including the labyrinth itself, one's own interiority, other people's presence), I leaned towards the definition of \"aesthetic\" that takes account of perception and sensation (the opposite of \"anaesthetic,\" to be without sensation), especially the haptic senses, the interoceptive and 32 proprioceptive,\" rather than philosophies of the beautiful (Fisher, 1997). That said, communal experiences on the labyrinth do tend to be extraordinarily touching and graceful, patterns of group behaviour that include gestures of respect, support, tolerance, accommodation and affection seen as elements of an improvisational dance form in a choreography of accompanying and leaving, turning toward and turning away from one another. Aesthetics of public art I think of the labyrinth as public art, because the one at St. Paul's was located in what we, perhaps misguidedly, considered relatively \"public\" space. Many groups used the parish hall where it was installed; the committee thought long and hard about making it permanent (see \"Parish\" in the Laboratory), and decided to do so on the grounds that it represented to anyone who saw it what we thought of ourselves corporately. The outdoor labyrinths in the region at that time, Justine Giuliani's landscaped seven-circuit in a public park in Burlington Ontario, and Holy Trinity's turf Chartres type in downtown Toronto, both fall within Lucy Lippard's definition of public art as accessible work of any kind that cares about, challenges, involves, and consults the audience for or with whom it is made, respecting community and environment. The other stuff is still private art, no matter how big, or exposed or intrusive or hyped it may be (1995, p. 121). It may be that all the labyrinth provides as a stand alone art form is a technology of witnessing\u2014 or \"enlightened listening,\" Levin suggests\u2014when as Suzanne Lacy says, there is no quick fix, \"only our ability to witness and feel the reality taking place around us. This feelingness is a service that artists offer to the world\" (in Gablik, 1995, p. 82). The increasing number of community labyrinths installed in public locations supports Lacy's view that \"new genre public art is based on engagement\" (1995, p. 19). Reports from the field: The labyrinth in the world While this inquiry has been guided by a particular set of interests, practitioners and investigators around the world have been working with the labyrinth in a range of *\u00b0 interoception, noun: sensitivity to stimuli originating inside of the body. proprioception, noun: the ability to sense the position and location and orientation and movement of the body and its parts. 33 settings, making progress in a number of important areas. The Veriditas facilitators' network, with its special interest groups for educators, researchers, health care specialists, and others, has made it possible to follow some of these. There has been much interest in the neurological impact, especially on school children, people under severe stress, and those with disrupted cognition. Carla Hannaford, a proponent of BrainGym in school settings, has written about the labyrinth under a heading of \"Play Entails Movement\" (2002, pp. 126-128): many schools have added a labyrinth to their playgrounds. These spiral structures are thought to balance the two hemispheres of the brain. The equal number of left and right turns, along with geometric regularity, has been found to establish a balanced (coherent) pattern for those who walk it. Walking through the spiral pattern has been shown to greatly help children labelled ADHD, autistic, dyslexic and emotionally handicapped. The labyrinth requires increased focus, attentiveness, and balance just to walk, skip or run through it. This calm, focused attention is reported to stay with the child during cognitive learning tasks. Some added advantages of the labyrinth for struggling students include: 1. Reaching the center is assured, so there is no failure\u2014 you can't do it wrong. 2. Walking the labyrinth is more about the journey than the destination, being more than doing. 3. The entire labyrinth is visible to the person as they walk is so there is no stress. Pamela Taylor shared with the Labyrinth In Schools SIG a report on her work with children with brain tumours as part of a discussion on suitability of labyrinth work for children with autistic spectrum disorders (May 3, 2006). The naming of the \"middle space\" is significant, associating place, emotion, embodied perception, and reflection in a personal map and symbol system, thus providing mnemonically a numbers of cognitive avenues to a valuable resource: We have begun using finger labyrinths with children at Texas Children's Hospital and have already had amazing results. Our research project will be with children with brain tumors who are on the same (St. Jude) protocol, using a control group and a group that will have their own labyrinths. Many people have had good results utilizing the labyrinth with children with ADHD -- both with walking the labyrinth and using finger labyrinths, so I think it would be great to try it out on children with autism. 34 There are many pictures of children walking and using finger labyrinths on the internet. With or without much coaching, children have reported that the finger labyrinth has given them a sense of peace, calmness, courage, and strength. We are hoping to find that it helps with coping, spirituality, and quality of life. So far, our patients have named the middle space on the labyrinth many things \u2014 God, confidence, the sun, the place one found his lost puppy, etc. They have drawn pictures before and after use and have also written poems and prose to share their experience. The Rev. Dr. Valerie Carnes, working as a chaplain to Alzheimer's patients, has observed a similar effect. Her account provides a vivid insight into an increasingly common and tragic illness, and the island of relief the labyrinth provides for those suffering from it: The mind begins to short circuit. Performing tasks that once were as natural as breathing becomes a source of frustration. Confusion begins to crush hope. The caregivers for early- to mid-stage Alzheimer's residents know that these misfires aren't going to go away. At the Alexian Brothers Valley Residence (ABVR) a dedicated Alzheimer's facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, an ancient ritual\u2014walking the labyrinth\u2014 is being used both as a therapy and a devotional aid for these residents. It taps into the spirituality that remains deep within their hearts and gives them \"A Place Where They Can't Get Lost\"\u2014the name of the ABVR labyrinth project. To create a calming atmosphere, all background noises (jingling keys, pagers, cell phones) are minimized. Votive candles in fireproof containers are placed on the edges of the canvas. Spiritual music, including chants, hymns, and folk and gospel hymns help the walker to center and calm himself/herself. Visually and aurally, walkers get the message: This is a place of peace, a place where you can't get lost. We have noticed that this ritual provides benefits such as short-term calming, relaxation, and relief from agitation and anxiety in otherwise fragmented lives. The restorative and calming value of the walk can last from two to three hours, or longer. \"Maggie,\" a former independent living resident was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's and moved to Valley Residence because of her increasing disorientation and wandering behaviors. As she walked with the chaplain she commented, \"This is a special walk, isn't it? When you walk, that's your prayer.\" Another resident, who was unresponsive, and even hostile, to staff suggestions, proudly refused an offer of assistance because, as he said, in the labyrinth he felt he still had 35 control of his life. \"This is my thing,\" he said. \"I can make up my own mind to do this. I do it because it is good.\" Practitioners working with adolescents and young adults find in them a similar need for a safe place to work things out. Anyone familiar with the career studies component of the secondary school system will appreciate the value of an integrative tool accessible and flexible enough for this age group. Paula Hills, working with young people in their \"gap year\" between secondary school and post-secondary education in the UK, describes her method: One way to help focus the walk for this age group is to suggest that they walk using a probe, or positive statement, that they may or may not believe. For example, \"My life is unfolding before me and the way is clear,\" or \"J am guided easily to my next step.\" These kinds of probes are useful because they usually lay the ground for our personality/mind to refute them. We may want to believe, and indeed we may, but often our fears and questions begin to surface when faced with such a positive probe. Then I would encourage the walkers to allow their resistances and feelings to arise without blocking them or engaging them too much, just to notice and acknowledge them. This is often enough direction for them to begin an opening process in which some kind of dialogue with their higher self/ the Divine may be facilitated. If not, no matter but then I suggest that they journal or draw immediately upon exiting. This often opens the floodgates. I offer a description of the snapshot journalling process which involves no censoring, stream of consciousness type writing. Alternatively, I may suggest that they write a letter to themselves from their Self, the wise and whole part of their being. Sometimes it is powerful to do this while in the center but you may want to suggest that only if it's a small enough group to not cause a traffic jam in the center. Another approach might be to begin by articulating the challenge they currently face. It helps to narrow it down, be specific. For example it is better to say \"I am fearful that J won't be able to find a job upon graduation.\" rather than \"Life scares me.\" Then I might suggest that they take that challenge and enter the labyrinth envisioning it as a large or cosmic womb into which they can take any challenge and be comforted. I might suggest that they notice what it feels like to be in the womb again with their grown-up life difficulties. 36 As a contribution towards a practical toolkit in Peace & Conflict Studies at the ground-zero level, Cathie Le Vasseur's use of the labyrinth in justice and reconciliation work in the work of after the war in Bosnia was a great breakthrough. Gillian Corcoran reports (2005): Bringing about a peaceful world begins within each one of us, and from there we all have our unique part to play in relationship to others. The goal of Cathie LeVasseur, who traveled to the Balkan peninsula to conduct labyrinth workshops during the Balkan Youth Reconciliation Seminar Series (2000), was to heal the wounds of war \"one heart at a time.\" The impact on the youth who participated exceeded expectations. One participant wrote, \"The labyrinth was a way for me to gather all my personal dreams and hopes into something bigger that Ill always keep in my heart as a peace message to the people all over the world.\" Another wrote: \"The labyrinth helped me get rid of some negative emotions and thoughts, it gave me energy, hope, and love. . . And now I believe! I believe the world can be better.\" Lippard has pointed out that \"community doesn't mean understanding everything about everybody and resolving all the differences; it means knowing how to work within differences as they change and evolve\" (1995, p.127). Clare Wilson's work in South Africa is a graphic example of this principle. She has designed the Reconciliation Labyrinth with two entrances, to be used in the Truth & Reconciliation process through which that nation is addressing the harm done by the policy of apartheid. In Walking the Path to Tomorrow Together, or Reconciling Inner and Outer Journeys, Wilson writes: The Reconciliation Labyrinth is designed with two entrances, recognizing that as South Africans because of apartheid we do not start the journey toward reconciliation from the same place. Like the \"person\" embedded into the design, the journey starts from where one's feet are. No matter how far apart we start, however, with the intention to relate, to recognize and reconcile our differences and to grow in the strength of our diversity, we can still make a start on our journeys. ) (c Sometimes the path allows us to travel alongside each other, sometimes it takes us away and sometimes towards each other but, if we keep walking, when we are at the furthest point from our divided entrance we find we are in the same path as each other. We then pass each other and walk the path that \"the other\" has walked, gaining 37 understanding along the way of how we were shaped to be where we are now. Eventually we reach our \"heart-space\" where we need to make a decision whether we want to walk into the centre together, a centre that belongs to us all. When it is time to leave we find that there is a third path, a new path, by which we can exit. Incorporated \"through the body,\" together and on our feet, walking into the future, still \"not-knowing\" but nevertheless on a journey of hope (quoted in Corcoran). A public elementary school in St Paul Minnesota has a reconciliation labyrinth for conflict resolution, described on the school website: Crossroads students and Susan Dustin, the school social worker, created a canvas labyrinth that is used for problem solving and conflict resolution. Unlike a maze, there are no dead ends in a labyrinth. Two students (or more) who are having a conflict walk the paths and go through the steps of stating the problem, stating their feelings, stating the other person's feelings, finding solutions, and choosing the best solution. Each circuit leads them closer to the center of the labyrinth where they affirm each other. Students like the kinesthetic approach of moving their bodies while they're talking through an issue. Students and teachers have also individually walked on the labyrinth as a means of calming themselves and enhancing well being. We're hoping that our labyrinth will help our students create a more peaceful learning environment.\"! | http://crossroads.spps.org/Peace Labyrinth.html. Accessed July 9, 2006. 6. UNDERSTANDING THE LABYRINTH Long familiar to classicists, folklorists, anthropologists, archaeologists, historians of art and architecture, both with and without the legendary the labyrinth as a place to actually practice walking meditation, rather than simply as a mythological remnant, archaeological oddity, or, in another dimension entirely, a literary metaphor, has been of growing interest in the West since the mid-1970s to those of two related but distinct orientations. One group focuses on documenting the origins of the turf and stone mazes of the British Isles, Scandinavia, and the Baltic regions, within a larger investigation of geomagnetic and ley line energies associated with megalithic archeo- astronomy, and pagan, Druidic and The other focuses on contemporary, embodied spirituality in practice, based on researcher Jean Houston's work, in the field of humanistic psychology, on states of consciousness (inspired in part by her childhood conversations with Teilhard de Chardin on the concept of the nodsphere), and developed further by Lauren Artress, an Episcopalian priest and psychotherapist in San Francisco, and her students (Artress, 1995, 1999; Houston, 1996). I have outlined this second orientation in the literature review. What follows now is a review of the labyrinth's historical origins, especially the medieval intellectual surroundings that engendered the eleven circuit cathedral form, and enough of the architectural and contemplative geometry for the reader to join in the mathematical quest I undertook, described in the Laboratory section. Labyrinth site and pattern There is little primary source material documenting either the history and rationale of the labyrinth installations or the development of the design. Several more recent catalogues exist, sometimes called gazetteers. The earliest and best known in English are W.H Matthews' introductory text from 1922, and Janet Bord's well-illustrated folkloric compendium published at the very beginning of what has come to be known as the Labyrinth Revival of the late twentieth century. Bord outlines the way the labyrinth survived in children's songs and games such as Troytown and hopscotch during the 38 39 centuries of official disuse, as Clarissa Est\u00e9s similarly traces ancient goddess religions in fairy tales (1992). Nigel Pennick's book examines the mythology, related art and architecture, symbolism, and all manner of relevant social history. He describes, for example, a \"Troy stone\" inscribed with a seven circuit labyrinth, donated in 1950 to the Witchcraft Museum near Tintagel in Cornwall by the daughter of Kate \"The Gull\" Turner, a \"wise woman\" of the Northern Tradition. Pennick supplies a lineage of the wise women in Manx who worked with it, and the method they were known to use with the stone to access trance states (p. 26). Pennick includes a number of sociological accounts, cross-referencing to other Celtic cultures, the Baltic, and India, although his focus is primarily the British Isles. He also deconstructs the pattern, teasing out the graphic origins in the meander patterns of the pre-Classical Mediterranean decorative element as seen in the graffiti of the seven-circuit found at Pompeii, and goes into the numerological and mathematical symbolism of the Chartres form in some depth . The most thorough introduction to the field currently is Hermann Kern's massive, scholarly, and profusely illustrated book, Through the labyrinth, first compiled as a catalogue for a labyrinth exhibition in Milan in 1981, and translated into English, updated, edited and re-issued in 2000. An art historian, curator, and lawyer by training, Kern takes on the folklorist's and mythologist's question\" of whether a newly emergent cultural form is a result of geographic contiguity, influence, or independent development. As well as an excellent introduction to the labyrinth as art form, dance notation, and cultural conveyance, Kern also raises questions about new labyrinth designs and art- making in contemporary culture (2000, pp. 305-6): It was a community, not an individual, that saw and recognized itself in the labyrinth, which is why attempts to transform this collective design into a (necessarily individual) artistic gesture intended for personal use meet with failure. The abilities of one person alone are not sufficient for this. After all, to achieve the only labyrinth transformations worth mentioning\u2014 the \"Roman quadrata\" and the Christianization of both the design and the concept in the ninth and tenth centuries\u2014the potential, propulsive force, and inventiveness of a widely practiced religion was needed. \"Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty is scathing about Joseph Campbell on this account (1983). 40 This insight provided a way to analyse the discomfort I was experiencing about the new copyrighted designs coming out of the USA. It supplied context for my labyrinth building activities at St. Paul's, the anonymity of which was a great relief from the tribulations of the gallery/grant/review art-making system that Gablik critiques (1991). Solidarity with anonymous medieval sculptors was a significant and unexpected gift in my research journey. Kern's insights about the development of the labyrinth in history provides context for its function as an public sacred site and art form. Cathedral architecture and medieval geometry The visionary architect John James has painstakingly developed a forensic method of dating and identifying by style the master builders and their respective building campaigns of the French Gothic cathedrals where the eleven circuit labyrinth was first installed. His analysis of their geometric methods is accessible and persuasive. As an esoteric system known at the time only to the architects and master builders, the cathedrals could be built by a sequence of teams over a hundred years with neither blueprints nor great disruption, once the architect had settled on the basic elements which were always laid out in ratios based on the Golden Mean. Given that cathedral architecture was evolving rapidly at the time, James argues that disputes arising from the proliferating geometry systems were solved using a technique from the medieval method of scholastic dialectics, the reconciliation of opposites, which he sees as \"at heart, an aesthetic approach,\" and which pervades the entire building. Significantly, \"through the analogies that numbers and shapes have always had to abstract ideas, it became the method for translating important theological concepts into stone\" (1982, pp 33, 34). He and Panofsky characterise the architects as highly educated men, philosophers, knowledgeable in geometry, masonry, building, and theology (Panofsky, 1957). Masonic, or \"sacred\" geometry (an adjective which annoyed my geometry professor, a Unitarian, who muttered disapprovingly, \"All geometry is sacred\"), the mathematics of origin of the cathedral and the labyrinth, is an all-encompassing way to contemplate the world as well as a practical tool for delineating space and ratio. Lawlor's book on philosophy and practice is an excellent guide into this most re-assuring form of 4] meditation, to contemplate as a subject, to engage in as a technique, and to experience as a template, a \"metaphor of universal order\" in the world (Lawlor, 1982). British architect Keith Critchlow's landmark article on the Chartres labyrinth as a cosmological model of the universe included a diagram of a thirteen-point star as the invisible underlying design basis. I and, eventually, my endlessly patient geometry professor (whose specialty is actually conic sections) found this proposition an irresistible challenge (Critchlow, 1973). Our subsequent pursuit of proof was an example of labyrinthine curriculum, and I devote the chapter in the Laboratory called \"Thread\" to it, with diagrams located in Appendix 6. What follows now are my impressions on first... Reading Critchlow Critchlow's exegesis on the thirteen sided polygon is embedded in the Architectural Association Quarterly article almost as an afterthought to a panoramic tour of influences and cosmological implications of labyrinth design.

The resulting rectangle has a 1.4142 proportion. Other dynamic rectangles are the V3, the V4, and the v5 rectangles. 24 Stone and turf labyrinths in Scandinavia and the British Isles were called Troytown (Troyaburg in Scandinavia) while a hopscotch game as well as temporary seaside sand labyrinths are still called Walls of Troy or Troytown in Scotland. \"Troy\" may refer to the walled city of Troy, or the word may have derived from the Celtic word tro, meaning to turn. See Bord's Mazes and Labyrinth of the World. 25 See Clarissa Pinkola Estes' theory of fairytales and folktales as cultural repositories for suppressed ideas in Women Who Run with the Wolves. ?\u00b0 Based on the rhythm of half and quarter revolutions in all but two of the circuits, the inner and the outer each of which has two half circuits, the walker make 17 separate movements, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, until an 18\" move forming the axis of symmetry \u2014in a half revolution opposite the entrance, in the 6\" and central circle\u2014and then 17 moves in a mirror image.

Brun\u00e9s suggests that the Timaeus is coded, esoteric language for transmitting geometry to initiates (1967). 43 divisions of a five-pointed star). Finally, geometry provides a basis of justice between individuals in the form of \"earth measure,\" going back to the etymological roots of the word in field measure when the Nile obscured boundaries after the annual flooding. \u00ae Continuity in geometrical design can be discerned throughout the cathedral. One element, for example, is the vesica pisces: in the central tympanum of the west facade, the \"Christ in glory\" within the mandorla, which is itself a symbol! both of the feminine creation-bearing \"prima material\" and the \"marriage\" shape of two overlapping circles. Traditionally this shape, (which is also the subject matter of the first proposition of Euclid), is taken in Christian symbolism to be the \"wedding\" of the spheres of heaven and earth. This shape is echoed in the circles that form the lunations around the circumference of the labyrinth, which are one side of a \"vesica\" construction, that is a 2/3rd circumference. \u00a9\u00ae Similar continuity of thought links the pattern of the labyrinth with = 7 a diagram of Medieval cosmology in Macrobius' Commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio\u2014 an influential work connecting classical and Medieval thought, a copy of which was known to have been in the library at the School of Chartres. The diagram shows \"a series of concentric circles with the earth at the centre (designated stationary), followed by the 'sphere' of moon, sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and surrounding this, the celestial sphere of fixed stars\" and beyond that, three more 'powers'; Soul (world soul), Mind, and Supreme God (the One).\" \u00ae This represents not only the structure of the universe but also in Neoplatonic terms, a diagram of the \"shells\" of reality. The individual, when confronted with this model and having chosen to traverse the path to the middle, was in fact re-enacting the \"descent of the soul\" into manifestation in earth (at the centre). \u00ae One of the psychological functions of traversing the maze, therefore, was to re-enact the contributing factors to the structure of one's personality. The six petals at the centre represent the six psychological crises (and the mysteries of the Christ narrative) in the process of individuation. \u00ae Analysis clarifies the significance of the six petalled centre: symmetry is only attained by the insertion of the path-width, dividing the circle into thirteen. A thirteen pointed star drawn with the maximum places between two successive \"points\" (or the sharpest angles) provides a particular proportion for the centre polygon: when placing this pattern over the whole maze, using the outer limits of the radiating lunations the polygonal hole in the centre tangents the centre circle. \u00ae Why thirteen?

[I]n the subject of sacred measure one does not claim precision of physical measurements as the only criteria. If the ancients, and in particular Plotinus and the Christian teaching, emphasized hierarchy, then it seems reasonable that we should expect hierarchy in the realm of measure, 1.e. finding a measure relevant, sufficient and worthy of the qualities of which are measured(p.19). \u00ae Thus the labyrinth in its architectural setting supports the individuation process in the traveller (often a catechumen) by directing the gaze upwards, upon turning to the exit to retrace the path back \"up\" and out, there to see the twelve-fold rose window set directly above the labyrinth in the western wall, its brilliant light symbolising the inner experience of illumination. \u00ae The illustration of periodicity and shape in the 13-gon, also known as the tridecagon or triskaidecagon, shows the thirteen pointed star created by the \"miss five\" interval, with the maximum span between two points and the sharpest angles resulting in the longest, \"most energetic\" configuration. \u00ae This model of harmony in the design of the cathedral between parts and whole is an antidote for the \"dislocations of modernity.\" Arguing that \"scientism\" has devalued any form of psychology that does not dehumanize the human organism, Critchlow warns that \"there may be a swing back into fantastic and cultivatedly irrational mystifications, feeding on the appetites of a 'creation' starved generation and turning valid psychological traditions of the past into modem superstitions as misleading as they are partitive.\" But deliberate receptivity to the experiential impact of a site such as Chartres Cathedral develops a knowledgeable appreciation for the \"depth and significance in certain traditional understandings of the wholeness of the human condition, body and psyche\" (p. 22). 46 The energy in polygons These ideas of Critchlow's were provocative. I had never thought of polygons in such terms, and continued to pursue the topic. I found that to say that polygons contain and express energy is one way to articulate complex aesthetic characteristics. Polygons have a compelling visual attraction: their \"radiant symmetry draws the eye towards the center, even when the center is blank\" (Walker, 1988, p. 66). There is the suggestion of gathering in from every direction, containment, and concealment within the impenetrable interlaced boundaries. Multi-pointed motifs are widely associated with representations of the divine. Islamic artists, forbidden for religious reasons to make images of living beings lest these encourage idolatry, developed an entire \"an-iconic\" \u2014 non-representational \u2014 art form based on complex patterns of geometric polygons that are both decorative and symbolic. These have had a strong influence on modern artists, notably the Dutch draftsman and master print-maker M.C. Escher, who, parallel to and independent of contemporary research mathematicians, worked out a complete theory of crystallographic form based on his studies of Moorish tiles (Schattschneider, 1990).*' Critchlow has devoted much of his career to the study of Islamic art and architecture, establishing the Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts unit at the Royal College of Art in London in 1984, where the techniques and underlying philosophy were fundamental to the curriculum. Islamic art is a universal language of contemporary significance because its first principle is unity, expressed in the holistic integration of structure, form and beauty, as well as the artist's intent: \"In very simple terms, it is to the glory of God or to the glory of the unity of creation...\" The geometrical patterns of Islamic art reveal intrinsic cosmological laws. Whereas in medieval Christian art the popularization of such forms and 5! Escher first read Polya's article of 1924, on the seventeen crystallographic groups illustrated as symmetry groups of tilings, in 1935, according to Branko Griinbaum, in: M.C. Escher: Art and Science, p. 54. Coxeter, the illustrious University of Toronto geometer, introduced Escher to divisions of the hyperbolic plane in 1957. Escher appreciated the illustrations but claimed the \"hocus-pocus text\" of no use to him! * Interviewed by Lydia Sharman Male, \"In the Mind of the Beholder,\" directs Kairos, \"an educational charity specifically founded to promote the recovery of traditional (perennial) values in the Arts and Sciences\" with particular attention to the Quadrivium. http://www.kairos- foundation.com/.

The knotted cord, associated with retaining and releasing power and control of energy and individuals, figures prominently in pagan, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, and ancient Egyptian traditions and rituals.

In general, the act of tying or untying the knot is of greater importance as a symbol than the knot itself (Biedermann, 1992, p. 199).\u00b0\" Knotted cord and stone circle The knotted cord is one of the symbols of Freemasonry which also include the triangle, tools such as the plumb and drafting compass, and rituals in honour of Pythagoras, whose twelve- knot string has been used for millennia to make the Pythagorean right angle triangle, the 3:4:5, used in the mason's or carpenter's square. The process of \"cording the temple\" in the reign of Amenhemhat is inscribed on the walls at Edfu, Denderah, and Karnak, in Egypt, illustrating how the axes of the proposed building were oriented towards the Ursa Major constellation by the High Priest, and the angles of the foundations laid out using the twelve knot cord. (Pennick, 1982, p. 44). In Time Stands Still: New light on megalithic science, a discussion of the use of the knotted cord to create the right angle triangle is part of a larger description of the origins of geometry. Critchlow's vivid writing takes the reader to the paleolithic world, following along with the earliest observers as they tracked the effect of the sun's movement on the length of the shadow cast by the axis mundi\u00ae that divides heaven from earth in Stone Age cosmology (echoed by the explorer planting the flag). They have noticed that the shadow of the gnomon changes throughout the day and Mee Lees during the year.

It exists in virtually all cultures on Earth. The axis mundi connects heaven and earth as well as providing a path between the two. It is commonly represented as a rope, tree, vine, ladder or staff, as well as many other things. Many cultures consider a specific place, almost always a hill, a mountain or a pyramid to be the axis mundi. Many religious structures explicitly mimic it. day by day in relation to the gnomon eventually form the arc of a circle completed by a similar record of the sunset \u2014 the interval-marking function of this early calendar provides explains the universal sigil of the earth as a circle with a cross in it \u00ae. The axis- gnomon establishes the centre of the circle, the diameter laid out east to west, crossed and divided into quadrants on the north-south axis. One can imagine the development, from the arc of each day's stones.\" A circle is drawn round the centre point and the tips of the axes where they meet the circumference are joined: a square is inscribed inside the circle. The diameter happens to be walked off in a length in unit-steps of the familiar number ten (familiar from counting off fingers and toes). The circumference is between thirty-one and thirty-two steps, (a = 3.1416...). Walking off the sides of the square takes seven steps. The perimeter of the square is four times seven, giving the twenty-eight divisions of the lunar month. Twenty-eight times thirteen lunar months in a sun-year is three hundred and sixty four. Where the divisions of day and night, equinox and solstice, are natural occurrences observed by humans, the seven day week is an invention, sacralised in ritual each time another spoke on the circle is passed. This may have been the origin of religious contemplation on the Sabbath. . The pattern of regular polygons remains unaltered no matter what size they are, or rather, what numerical value is given to the distance between points. Number as quantity, the enumeration of units, differs from number as quality, the relationship between elements. Four stones can constitute a square and each be considered units of measurement, but the distance between them across the diagonal can never be expressed in whole numbers. This relationship between the rational and the irrational, what Critchlow and Lawlor call the \"suprarational\"\"\u00b0 was considered by traditional peoples to be the manifestation of the Unity of the divine, the Many-in-One, the foundation of the principles of ancient temple mathematics.

The root rectangles, Vesica Pisces, eight point star, and golden proportion diagrams are discernible throughout architecture with proportions based on temple mathematics. As manifestations of divine Unity the geometrical constructions were considered subjects for profound, not to say elaborate, meditations on the continuity between Man and Creator. However, as Temple knowledge was transmitted only to initiates, it was forbidden to discuss them openly, resulting in the puzzling obscurity of treatises such as Plato's Timaeus, which, Brun\u00e9s argues (pp.76-80),\"' only makes sense to those outside the fraternity of initiates with the diagrams to illustrate the discussion.\" The masons' guild protected this secrecy by creating diagrams which similarly make no sense unless the unifying element is supplied. An excellent example of this is the eight-point star here *! \"Plato speaks of Timaeus as being a famous philosopher from the city of Locris in the Greek area of southern Italy, who gives a lecture on the universe for the initiated brethren Socrates, Critias, and Hermocrates, and a fifth brother, not named, but probably Plato himself. Timaeus is described as an astronomer of the philosophical school with strong links with the Pythagorean line and a sweep of the learning of Empedocles. But....all [including Pythagoras, around 500 B.C.E.] had been connected with Egyptian Temple schools and were thus initiated brethren\" (p. 77). \" See also Brun\u00e9s' chapter on the dimensions of Moses' Tabernacle in the Book of Exodus. 52 illustrated. The working template for the master mason, providing all grids for division of the plane into two, three, four, five, six, eight sectors and their multiples, it was generally drawn without the enclosed circle, to exclude the uninitiated. This is an excellent point in the text to introduce some context for these excursions into arcane geometrical practices. Broadening my research outwards into Medieval thought opened up the whole spectacular cosmological structure, with its beautiful principles of reconciliation and transparency. The Twelfth Century Renaissance Although written records of the design negotiations and commercial transactions connected with building the cathedral at Chartres were lost centuries ago, one may speculate about this twelfth century design process with the awareness that a renaissance of intellectual thought was flourishing in northern France. As the architectural project attracted the finest architects, builders, sculptors and craftsmen, so the church brought in the most advanced thinkers for its school. An intellectual tradition developed under the direction of such famous names as Bernard, Fulbert, Gilbert de la Porr\u00e9e, Thierry,\"' and Guillaume de Conches. For a period of roughly two hundred years, until the waning of the High Gothic period in art and architecture and, with the death of Thomas Aquinas in 1274, the end of High Scholasticism in philosophy, the hundred mile circle around Paris was the centre of intellectual activity, \"many masters from many nations' bringing new influences and opportunities for cross-fertilizations. Some of the many factors \" Of local interest is the fact that Thierry's monumental Heptateuch, the \"Bible of the seven liberal arts,\" was destroyed during the Allied bombardment of WWII along with rest of the municipal library of Chartres. Two microfilms remain, one made by the Benedictine monks of Mont-C\u00e9sar (Louvain) and the other by the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto (Jeauneau, 1995, p. 67). 44 Bishop Suger of St. Denis Cathedral, in Panofsky, 1957, p. 4. 53 contributing to this extraordinary era were the decline of feudal monopoly of land use, the resulting freedom of movement and political association of artisans into powerful guilds, mobility of workers and goods in a market economy, and an explosion of technological advances, including the draft yoke, waterwheel and mechanical clock, which impacted extensively upon both material and intellectual life (Chenu, 1997, p. 39). The rediscovery of Plato and Aristotle in translation marked a renewed appreciation of the resources of Antiquity, the bringing to light of ancient materials which itself signalled a \"hunger of the spirit\" that Artress recognizes in our era, ushering in a joyful rebirth whose exhilaration and abundance P\u00e9re Chenu gleefully describes: To broaden a too narrow conception of the reactivation of ancient values, whether in the twelfth century or in others, all one needs to do is to evoke the cathedral being built at the shrine of Chartres in a burst of creative zeal and decorated with the most realistic scenes from contemporary life at the very moment when Gilbert of La Porr\u00e9e was at work glossing Boethius; or the lofty theme of the Grail as handled by Chr\u00e9tien of Troyes, who was also curious about ancient things; or the rise of communes and corporate urban society, the leaders of which were to give a prompt and eager reception to the Politics of Aristotle; or, in the case of John of Salisbury, to take into account the crucial role of his very modern political experience as well as the ancient ingredients with which the immense erudition of his Policraticus abounds (p. 4). As previously mentioned, two fundamental precepts characterize the intellectual activities of this period: the reconciliation of opposing ideas within an all-encompassing unity, and transparency of means, elements, and parts. These are the principle elements of Scholasticism, the dialectical approach to knowledge that had a profound impact on education by marking a departure from the traditional pedagogical method of unquestioning memorization of texts. The medieval worldview from which Scholasticism emerged (James 1982, p. 98), saw the world in polarities. Ambivalence was inherent in the first act of Creation. It was as fundamental to the universe as the world itself, and dominated all manifest reality. In philosophy as in architecture they strove to reach beyond the poles to that calm centre where all is one. To reconcile the irreconcilable... they perfected, into a fine art that determined the form of academic instruction, the ritual of the public disputationes de quodlibet. 54 These disputationes, dealing with all imaginable questions of the day (quodlibet), were social events, the equivalent of our public lectures. Because mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences had not yet developed esoteric professional languages, any \"normal non-specialized intellect\" could follow them. Nor had the growing trend to an urban professionalism yet hardened into social distinctions of the guild system. Thus \"the priest and the layman, the poet and the lawyer, the scholar and the artisan could get together on terms of near equality\" (Panofsky, pp 23-24). These disparate professional perspectives had in common a commitment to \"Manifestio, elucidation or clarification ...the first controlling principle of Early and High Scholasticism\" (p. 30). Their cognitive repertoire included a fine appreciation for metaphor and allegory, something that one might see as a function of imagination: human reason can elucidate the content of revelation [because]...it can supply similitudines which \"manifest\" the mysteries by way of analogy, as when the relation between the Three Persons of the Trinity is likened to that between being, knowledge and love in our own mind, or divine creation to the work of the human artist (Aquinas in Panofsky, p. 30). Curriculum of the School of Chartres This new approach to knowledge centered upon the School of Chartres, whose \"optimistic intellectuality ... at the opposite pole from a mechanistic interpretation of the universe\" (Chenu, p.23) was, like the cathedral itself, a meticulously conducted adventure on the philosophical, theological, and architectural frontiers of the times. As early as the seventh century, the importance of the site as a focus of Christian pilgrimage had superceded the original Carnutian druidic cult of the Virgo Partitura for whom the spring lying beneath the cathedral's crypt was a sanctuary (Favier et al., 1990, p.30). This tradition of the cult of the Virgin, both as Theotokos (Mother of God) and as intermediary in her own right, influenced the architecture of the cathedral and the philosophy of the school in subtle ways. 55 The School of Chartres is traditionally associated with a neo-Platonic, proto-humanist perspective.*\u00b0 What is known of the graduated curriculum based on the study of the Seven Liberal Arts comes to us primarily from Thierry's Heptateuch, a collection of about fifty Classical texts and commentaries in the arts by authors including Euclid, Ptolemy, and Cicero, whose notion of \"wisdom joined with eloquence,\" that is learning joined with effective communication of it, guided the educational endeavour. The curriculum followed the Classical Septivium, which had two parts: first, the study of language and argument in the elementary trivium \u2014 the \"three channels,\" learning whose purpose is to analyse and disseminate thought: grammar, or the art of saying exactly what one wants to say; rhetoric, or the art of making oneself understood; dialectics, or the art of persuasion (Favier et al., p. 39). This preceded advanced study in the quadrivium, the \"four ways\" of knowing the world: arithmetic, or the science of numbers and analysis; geometry, or the science of space and how to master it; astronomy, or the science of mechanisms apprehended by observation as much as by reflection; and music, or the science of universal harmony of auditory vibration (Favier, p. 39). These were considered essential for anyone wishing to understand their place in Creation, according to Master Thierry: \"The custom of the Ancients was to learn mathematics first, so as to be able to access knowledge of divinity\" (in Jeauneau, 1995, p. 70)... because, in the tripartite division of speculative philosophy, mathematics occupies a central position between the physical on the one hand and theology on the other. Mathematics, whose proper object of study is the Ideal Form, has points in common with the physical, of which it requires material support, and theology, because its object is the non-material. Jeauneau describes this interdependence as being \"like a bridge thrown between the material world and the \"\u00b0 Southern argues that the Schoo] was inaccurately called neo-Platonic, as \"the sum total of the works of Plato known ... in the twelfth century was one half of one dialogue, the Timaeus.\" Neo-Platonic beliefs, in his opinion, are examples of a \"certain instinctive Platonism, which comes not from reading Plato, but from having a mind that reacts to some great problems in a way similar to Plato's. This similarity of outlook transcends all boundaries, but it was not encouraged by the methods of the schools, whether at Chartres or elsewhere\" (1979, pp. 7, 5). The intention of the cathedral schools at that time was to establish a body of stable, unambiguous knowledge and the Timaeus could not, beyond Plato's account of the organisation of the elements of the universe, be considered like Aristotle and Boethius, reliable and orderly. \"Plato was valued as a doorway to knowledge. It is the function, as well as the fate, of a door to be left behind\" (p.10). 56 intelligible universe, which must be traversed by those who had any pretence of theological knowledge\" (p. 70).*\u00b0 The significance of this lies in the restoration of the realm of the material to a status worthy of dignity, after centuries of being despised in a material\u2014spiritual polarization typical of traditional monastic thought (and not unlike the challenge of bridging the material-spiritual schism faced by proponents of spirituality in education in our present education environment). Chenu describes Godfrey of Saint-Victor, drawing up a chart of trades according to their function in society and taking exception to the definition long given of the mechanical arts and derived from a false etymology, an etymology that he says or adulterate sciences\")\u2014the view having been that these adulterate the spiritual dignity of man by associating it with matter (p. 44).*\" The cathedral itself bears witness to this evolution of value, in the representation everywhere, in sculpture and stained glass, of working people, labourers, artisans, and tradesmen and women, who had, in fact, supplied a good deal of the funding and the energy for the lightning fast reconstruction of the building within thirty years following the devastating fire of 1194. Gilbert de Porr\u00e9e made the distinction between three aspects of the \"divine governance\": opus Creatoris, the divine creative force; opus naturae, the operations of Nature\u2014 \"to bring forth like things from like through seeds or offshoots, for nature is an energy inherent in things,\" said William of Conches; and the work of humans, homo artifex, who, \"in math\u00e9matiques occupent une position moyenne, entre la d'une part, et la th\u00e9ologie de l'autre. Les math\u00e9matiques ont un point commun avec la physique, *\" Jeauneau quotes William of Conches on a further development of the curriculum into a practical or moral philosophy having three subsections: individual, domestic, and civil ethics; and the other, theoretical philosophy, also having three subsections: Theology, Mathematics (the guadrivium), and Physics. In the revision of the Philosophia text (whether by William or another), room was made, along side the liberal arts, for the mechanical arts, including a trivium of weaving, armament, navigation, and a quadrivium of agriculture, hunting, medicine, and theatre. This division, embracing the sciences and technologies, are in accord with those proposed in the same period as Hugh of Victor's Didascalicon, Book 2. (p. 78). 57 How the labyrinth illustrates the philosophy This perspective suggests a philosophical context for the installation of the labyrinth as a place of actively engaging, embodied, personally transformative contemplation: a public place, not cloistered away; a visual metaphor, available to novice as well as initiate, of paradox and simultaneity\u2014 of confusion within order, multiplicity within unity, movement within stillness, free will and overarching design; created, by homo artifex, in a cathedral honouring the principle of fecund creativity, the Virgin Mother of God. Theologians were beginning to use the word universitas as a noun, to describe an entity. A new concept of human-as-microcosm and the Universe-as-macrocosm was emerging, out of the ability to apprehend the world as a whole and oneself as part of it, as having a nature and being part of Nature. The medieval practice of mythography, the allegorisation of classical mythology (Chance, 1994; 2000), provide context for Macrobius' Commentary on the Dream of Scipio (an aid in understanding Critchlow's article mentioned earlier), and to the focus Doob places on Boethius's Consolations of Philosophy, with its images of argument as labyrinth, explicating as it complicates, converting confusion to clarity (1990, p. 258). Scientific observation was making it possible perceive the profound underlying structure\u2014'\"a world of forms transcending the medley of visible and sense-perceptible phenomena. The whole penetrates each of its parts; it is one universe; and its intelligible Model is itself a Whole\" (Chenu, p.6). Plato had said so, in the influential Timaeus (30d. 2\u20145, in Chenu, p. 6): Then God, having decided to form the world in the closest possible likeness to the most beautiful of intelligible beings and to a Being perfect in all things, made it into a living being, one, visible, and having within itself all living beings of like nature with itself. In architectural terms this translated into conceptualising the human artefact of the cathedral as a microcosm and model of the universe and, metaphorically, of the body and life of Christ. Wright, citing the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, argues persuasively that the labyrinth's location in the nave, in geometrical counterpoint to the altar and choir,* signifies its identity as a form of Purgatory that recalls Christ's harrowing Hell in search of lost souls between His crucifixion and Resurrection (p.85): \"8 See Appendix 4 for illustration. 58 Medieval theologians often spoke of Christ's life as a round-trip transitus, a coming and going from Paradise to Hell and back. Thus the Lord's journey can be conceptualized not only as horizontal movement east-west- east, but also vertically, as empyrean-abyss-empyrean. Either way, it was seen as a linear progression with two features: a point of reversal is found at the center, and the places of beginning and ending are the same, conditions also inherent in the labyrinth of the church. Was this experience of symbolic \"place\" a perspective limited to the clerics and theologians? Accounts based on the records of the cathedral at Auxerre describe liturgical dances and dramas specifically involving the labyrinth as being performed by the clergy and monks at Easter. Wright distinguishes between the mystery play, sacred drama presented in the vernacular and out of doors for the general populace, and a genre of medieval theatre called liturgical drama, performed in Latin inside the church, to which the \"Harrowing of Hell\" belonged (p. 84). Not until the 17\" century do references to a meditative experience for laypersons begin to appear (Wright, p. 213). Bakhtin, writing about the function of the \"carnevalesque\" in the history of human creativity, describes the two aspects of medieval man: \"one official, monolithically serious and somber; beholden to strict hierarchical order; filled with fear, dogmatism, devotion and piety; the other, of carnival and the public place, free; full of ambivalent laughter, sacrileges, profanations of all things sacred, disparagement and unseemly behaviour, familiar contact with everybody and everything\" (in Greene, 1995, p. 63).\" It was a paradoxical age when cathedral building campaigns co-existed with the waste and belligerence of the Crusades. James reminds us that \"the most incredible variety of pilgrimages, markets and fairs, of petty princedoms and of religious ideas both catholic and heretical,\" that it was, briefly, a \"a short but brilliant period ...a much more individualistic and venturesome time than most primitive and many historical cultures\" when \"a profound other-worldliness and mysticism ... steered every citizen, in his own personal way, towards a vision of the spirit\" (1982, p.180). a polarisation of identities, behaviours, and sites reminiscent of McLaren's distinction between 'schoolroom and streetcorner personae in Toronto schoolchildren (1993). Eleven circuit labyrinths were always inside the cathedral buildings in Medieval France. They have always been outdoors, in Germany and the British Isles, as have, historically, seven circuit Classical labyrinths. This reflects their association with non-Christian nature-based fertility ritual. 59 Gothic architecture and Scholasticism The achievement in Scholastic thought, as in Gothic architecture, was a transparency of orderliness. Schooling had moved from the rural monasteries to the city cathedrals, and served a growing population of urban professionals. The architects were well-educated, well-travelled, and comparatively well-paid, with high status: the labyrinths in cathedrals were the finishing touches to their projects, and their portraits sometimes appeared in the bastions of the octagonal forms, along with that of the commissioning bishop.\" Their task was to interpret the iconographic system worked out with the scholastic advisors of the church, and convey this to the artisans whom they supervised, the sculptors, glass painters, and masons. Panofsky provides a vivid portrait of the architect arriving at the site \"carrying gloves and a rod, to give a curt order, now a byword in French literature to 9 66 describe a man who does things well and with superior assurance, 'par cy me le taille (p. 25).\"? \u00b0\u00b0 Gothic architecture came into being in the fle de France region, the core of France that includes Paris more or less at its geographic center. In medieval times the /le de France consisted mainly, but not entirely, of lands belonging to two ecclesiastical jurisdictions: the archdiocese of Sens and that of Reims Of the eight dioceses that formed the see of Sens, by far the largest was that of Chartres. All of the large pavement mazes situated within churches in France were found in sanctuaries in just these two ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Those resting within the territory of the archbishop of Sens all appear to have been of the circular Chartrian type, while their counterparts in the land owing obedience to the archbishop of Reims were, with a single exception, all octagonal in form. The mazes in the archdiocese of Sens were generally earlier than those of Reims. The Chartres labyrinth was the earliest and largest and characterized by unique features such as the central rosette and the lunations on the perimeter. (Wright, 2001, p.38) \u00b0'\"Here's where you cut it for me.\" The architect carried a rod (virga) because the principles of sacred geometry permitted all elements in a building to be defined in relation to the originating unit, and transposed to the final scale pantographically, rather than conveyed through fixed numerical measurement. The analogy from doctrine to artistic representation was characteristic of Medieval thought: Aquinas called it clarification through similitudines - the manifestation of mysteries. Such clarification was the first principle of Scholastic thought whose primary goal was the elucidation of faith by reason, in order to distinguish it from the realm of revelation. Yet both reason and the evidence of the senses were necessary \u2014 Aquinas [\u00a7QRISOIRENTESSo Roy Le ae . . TN RM RM aT TRAC aY says: \"the senses delight in things duly proportioned as in ace P aa part of the cathedral.

'balanced. and The intention was \"to make faith clearer by appeal to SSesicorn ese imeey me dbeney reason, to make reason clearer by appeal to the Rane ne imagination, and make imagination clearer by an appeal to the senses.\" This articulation was apparent in the Seah ne one anoth\u00e9e structuring of both argument and architecture. The form had to express the unity of the content. Thus the sprawling [fF WCE eer Ttng encyclopaedic libri sententiarum of the eleventh century have appeared to be h : : confusion may be seen to gave way to the concise and exhaustive summa of the \" me ; weg 3 stem from divine twelfth, with division and subdivision of the argument and Atal rented Retest a thinking into chapters, headings, tables of contents, the SO secundum ordinem disciplinae which kept the reader . .

The parallel movement in architecture can be Rear icrnean seen where the impenetrability of the Norman church opposites was a function o Medieval dialectics (Doob,* aces became the cross section of the nave visible on the exterior facade of the Gothic cathedral, all the elements at the same logical level, the members all of one class, in hierarchical subdivisions clearly articulated and without disparity. Panofsky suggests that inharmonious elements were suppressed, such as the crypt, the gallery, or towers other than the two on the west entrance (p. 44). However, he describes the dialectical process in the summa (and gives an example from Honnecourt's dispute 60 61 with another architect on the Ideal Chevet in which, he says, \"scholastic dialectics has driven architectural thinking to a point where it almost ceases to be architectural\") as a reconciliation of contradictory statements, both sanctioned by canonical authority. First the question is posed. Then the arguments for one side, videtur quod, are presented, then the opposing sed contra, and the solution, respondeo dicendum are given, a final transcendence of what Abelard refers to as the \"sic et non' of discourse (p. 69), though Bacon called it the forced harmonisation, \"concordia violentes\" of jurists. The Scholastic required explicitness, while the Humanist wanted harmony. Given the ability and training of the educated Medieval mind to think both metaphorically and systematically, it follows that the next major technical advance in art was the use of perspective in space by Giotto and Duccio (which later contributed to Cartesian monocularism and the ensuing impact on perception, reification, and instrumentalism, discussed elsewhere). Representation of the concept of the Infinite was made possible by the re-interpretation of the painting surface as a transparent picture plane beyond which lay projected a vanishing point, a credible physical place apparently accessible to the viewer. This transcendence of material to convey an idea was the metaphysical underpinning of the earlier cathedral structures. The newly transparent picture plane is \"talking\" about the same concept as the architecture articulated through its unity of proportion, the larger idea behind the magnificence of the building or the graceful arrangement of colour and subject matter. Material itself becomes a metaphor, a conveyance rather than an end in itself. This elucidates Aquinas' meaning in the analogy he draws between the Creator and the human artist: \"God's spirit is said to move over the waters as the will of artists moves over the material to be shaped by their art\" (in Fox, 1992, p. 248). The processes of agency, of Creation, of building design or argument, must be so clear as to permit the observer to re-experience the event of their composition. 7. THE LABYRINTH AS LABORATORY : area 3 ; y PO.) ae ee Tae eS eo one Re pm 62 63 A calling I had returned to university for undergraduate work, intrigued with the way my high school art students seemed to grow and flourish, some quite dramatically, during the workshop sessions I had with them. Although the assignments were challenging, the metalworking tools demanding, the material recalcitrant, the students had been almost without exception cheerful, inventive, and tenacious. Often coming in early and staying late, each class developed an effervescent sort of \u00e9sprit du corps that spilled out of the art studio into the school hallway, along with the haze of burning wax and cuttlebone and the screech of power tools on metal, as they raced towards completion and the triumphant final exhibition in the front hall display case. It appeared to me that some individual and collective shift was going on during the learning process, and I wanted to find out what factors might be involved and how they were related. Back in school fulltime again after many years away, I could feel my own foundations shifting. To pursue the question of contributing factors in my students' educational experience from as many angles as possible, I had switched from a part time Arts degree by distance education to Independent Studies, a self-directed learning program, tethered only by my academic advisor's approval. I completed the Hot Metal/Hot Words project, on the links between language, eidetic imagery, and experiential learning in adolescence from a Vygotskyan perspective.\" >? Compton, V.J. \"Hot Metal / Hot Words: Event and interpretation as developmental tools in adolescent self concept.\" The Journal of Experiential Education 20, no. 2, (Fall 1997). ISSN: 1053-8259. A multi-dimensional content analysis instrument of twenty high school art students' stream-of-consciousness journal material produced while participating in an intensive art/technology (metal foundry) workshop showed that frequencies of selection of particular journal topics and references to affective states (e.g. excitement, fear) correlated positively to statements of personal resolve in the face of perceived obstacles. Results suggest that participation in the process of sequenced foundry practice (\"extreme\" art class), reminiscent of the \"vision quest\" ritual initiation traditional to adolescence, combined with reflective writing, provides an arena for teenagers to experience and reflect upon their successful grappling with challenging situations. The content of their writing indicates that their insights transfer to areas of their lives outside the art classroom. 64 What should come next? My advisor was an architecture professor, so my proposal to look at the physical context of learning and the parallels between art practice and spiritual practice, creativity and religious experience made sense to him: sometimes the appearance of a piece of sculpture really does seem miraculous to its artist, as well as being ontologically bouleversant. In a religious course on sacred places, I decided to do my seminar presentation on the Minotaur and the labyrinth, knowing these only through art history and classical studies texts. I had located a method on the Internet for making a seven circuit Classical labyrinth that looked simple enough to do during class time, and Dr. Bird * was all for experiential learning. Accompanied by a collection of Minotaur sculptures I'd made over the years, and armed with rolls of tape, balls of string, instruction sheets, and a stack of handouts on mythology and Carl Jung quotes, we laid out the unicursal labyrinth pattern in Making a seven circuit labyrinth with tape masking tape on the floor of the college refectory, a big bright room with tall windows along one wall. Working in teams, we completed it in time for everyone to walk through it and double back out again in one long continuous line. One of my fellow students, Joan, an older woman with a hesitant demeanour, participated with growing discomfort. It was a large group. Most were undergraduates in their early twenties, who enjoyed working together on the layout and racing each other along the finished path in what I later learned was a time-honoured tradition of northern European village festival *3 T was fortunate to study with the late, great Dr. Michael Bird of the Religious Studies Department, Renison College, University of Waterloo. A brilliant scholar, beloved teacher, fine musician, irrepressible wit, visionary, mentor, and friend, Dr. Bird was a gentle soul, on Earth with us all too briefly. It is hard to believe that he is gone. He is sorely missed. celebrations. But the close proximity of so many people made her uneasy, Joan said. She had felt crowded during the walk, anxious and a little dizzy and queasy. J did not know what to think of this. It was my first time in a labyrinth, as well. Not knowing what to expect, I had been too pre- occupied with the preparations and construction to attend much to my own experience. The following week, at class, Joan was sitting alone, apart from her friends. \"T've had an awful weekend, don't ask,\" I heard her reply when they greeted her. I approached her and enquired whether she had thought any more about her experience with the labyrinth the previous week. She looked at me appraisingly, and then said that yes, she had. Would she tell me about it? I asked. She thought for a while again before 65 I first encountered the labyrinth at a Mystery School seminar with Dr. Jean Houston. This little-known medieval pattern was described as a powerful spiritual tool whose path would lead us to our own centre. I was hardly prepared for the force of my own reaction. As soon as I set foot into the labyrinth I was overcome with an almost violent anxiety. That evening I felt drawn back to walk the labyrinth alone three more times. (Artress p.2) replying. Yes, she would. She then described what had happened on the weekend. Her husband had fallen and hit his head, and, in an angry outburst, blamed the mishap on her. She had started to apologize, trying to smooth things over, \"like I always do,\" when she suddenly realized that it was not her fault and therefore not something to apologize for. Then it occurred to her that very few of the things she had apologized for over the last 30 years had been her fault either. The insight flashed through her mind that her long disappointing marriage was a labyrinth, and her husband, whose customary belligerence masked early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, was the Minotaur at the centre of it. She had decided on the spot to listen finally to her grown children's urgings, and that weekend had begun the arrangements to have her husband institutionalized. She seemed relieved to be able to talk about it. I was taken aback by this extraordinary story and by its implications. Henderson's comments about initiation, which I had included in my seminar handouts, resonated with the details of what had happened: \"In all cultures, the Labyrinth means the entangling and confusing representation of the world of Matriarchal consciousness; it can be traversed only by those who are ready for a special initiation into the mysterious world of the 66 collective unconscious\" (1964, p. 117). Initiation, for women as well as for men, requires trials of strength that lead to sacrifice for the sake of the birth of a new self. \"This sacrifice enables a woman to free herself from the entanglement of personal relations and fits her for a more conscious role as an individual in her own right\" (p.126). Coming to terms with the Beast, the masculine principle as animal-man, for \"older women ... can be the expression a certain kind of woman's initiation ... when the union of spirit and nature is disturbed\" (p. 132). By that account, Joan had finally made operational sense of the central dilemma in her life, gaining the necessary perspective by re-enacting, metaphorically one could say, in the sense that she was becoming her own liberator, a ritual based in myth\u2014and was making significant life-changing decisions on the basis of this knowledge. That was a distinct shift in the epistemological landscape for me\u2014no longer was the labyrinth merely an archaic pattern in a Larousse Encyclopzedia, and I was not so sure that the Minotaurs were all behind the picture plane either. Just because the horns were invisible did not make them any less monstrous. These mythological characters are cultural representations of archetypes, powerful forces when they are activated, influential in the lives of real people, whether they are conscious of the source or not. Most significantly, we had set off these forces quite inadvertently. Intention, or lack of it, did not seem to be necessary for efficacy. This was unnerving! I had simply assumed that the Academy automatically provided the distance of objectivity towards any activity going on in its domain. We were studying sacred space, not actually creating it! I felt a bit like Mickey Mouse in the role of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, naively invoking invisible forces I knew very little about, in spite of my preparations, research, and handouts. Although it is clear, in retrospect, that my colleague was ready to enlarge her perception and make some far-reaching changes in her situation, still I had the sense that I had stumbled onto, or into, some powerful catalyst of psychological transformation. Things could have gone quite differently for Joan under the circumstances, and I had an ethical responsibility to study it far more extensively before J tried it again. Later that week, J had a phone call from an individual who had been given one of my bracelets as a gift, and was calling to find out more about it. We got talking about art, and therapy, transformation and the labyrinth. It turned out that she was an art therapist whose 67 specialty was working with people, especially those with dissociative personality disorder, whose distorted perception of their body after trauma interfered with the process of their recovery. She was familiar with the labyrinth, which she used in her practice. She suggested that I read Lauren Artress' book, Walking a Sacred Path: Rediscovering the Labyrinth as a Spiritual Tool, based on her work with the labyrinth as Canon Pastor and Canon for Special Ministries at Grace Cathedral (Episcopal) in San Francisco. At the time I discovered the labyrinth, Artress had been working with the eleven- circuit Chartres cathedral version since 1991, establishing Veriditas, a non-profit organization dedicated to introducing people to the labyrinth in 1996. Artress had developed protocol models for practitioners in ministerial and therapeutic settings, offering training sessions at the Cathedral and at workshops, known as \"Theatres of Enlightenment,\" at retreat centres around North America. In collaboration with Keith Critchlow and environmental designer Richard Feather Anderson, Artress had put together a kit that detailed the installation method developed by the team from Grace Cathedral. This made the pattern widely available to communities interested in building their own labyrinths. Such initiatives in an institutional context need the support of visionaries at the executive level. I was fortunate to belong to such a congregation at St. Paul's Westdale, where the Rev. Paddy Doran officiated. Within six months of first encountering the labyrinth, I was in San Francisco to participate in the training program with Dr. Artress, with the understanding that when I returned home I would be welcome to install a labyrinth and develop the related activities. Out of the blue my search for factors of transformational events in education was becoming an international adventure. Looking back years later, 1 wonder what would have happened if Joan and I had not had that conversation. I am deeply grateful that she had shared her story with me\u2014and that I had got up the nerve to ask about it. After the phone call with the art therapist, I realized that, although synchronicity occurred frequently in my life, the incidents concerning this labyrinth had an intense quality, not easily dismissed. Both connections had been made because someone had reached out. Someone had taken that first step towards encounter. My life was shifting too. ** \"The Voice-of the World Wide Labyrinth Movement.\" http://www. veriditas.net/about/index.html. The Island of Inquiry 68 69 \"The Island of Inquiry\" de-coded and explicated Made at the outset of the research journey, this picture brought to light some of the preconceptions and intentions shaping the work. It can be seen as a topographical map of the inner landscape travelled over the course of a scholarly inquiry. Its insularity recalls Rosenstiehl's observation that we each have our own piece of the labyrinth to explore and report on; the research project, like labyrinths and islands, has a delineated perimeter and mysterious interior (although the limits of the research project may be permeable and shifting). While it was my island, it wasn't an exclusive place, sharing geomorphology, vegetation, creatures, systems and patterns with other lands, peoples, and researchers. The CATHEDRAL at the bottom of the picture is Notre Dame de Chartres in the Beauce region of France, where the first eleven-circuit labyrinth was built for public engagement. It was the site of the School of Chartres, the first university in France, a neo-Platonic mystery school using the Septivium curriculum. The ISLAND at low tide on the lower left is Mont St. Michel, La Merveille. Never captured or occupied by invaders, Mont St. Michel is considered to be the soul of France. The PONTONS at the upper right are found at Juno Beach, where both my biological and adoptive fathers landed in the Normandy Invasion, the Marathonikai of the 20\" century. The GARGOYLES of Our Lady, lower right, refer to the oral culture of the Middle Ages, and by extension, to translation between media and modalities. They are animated yet immobilised, a part of their residence walls and towers\u2014they are architecture. In this they are unlike the goats, horses, feathered creatures and whales who range widely in their respective ecological strata. MOUNTAINS reference the Massif Central of the Western European canon, climbed by paths and perseverance. A sub-text is the resemblance to my adoptive father, also immobilised, physically by polio, cognitively by tradition: he was Olympian in his knowledge (see note104). As an interdisciplinary researcher, I hang off the ledges of his learning and leap into the updrafts and across disciplinary chasms. The GOATS are me the Capricorn, the kid, the butt-head, capering on top of any height I can find. Eats and digests nearly everything. The TRACKLESS SEA refers to Sarah Kofman's exegesis on the parentage of Eros in Plato's Symposium; also to Crossing the Great Water in the I Ching. 70 There are four collage works that connect to Island as scenes or forays. Stepping out of the known world, which marks the start of the chapter called \"Thread: An essay about origins + labyrinthine learning,\" is a close-up of the central highlands, at the moment when the steel boots of the \"epistemological conquistador\" (Patrick Diamond's stirring description) cross over the border, an event marked by the path appearing beneath her tentative feet as in the story of Parsifal. The boots look like the emerging sprouts of some strange metallic botanical specimen. We are on another planet maybe: a silvery lunar world, indicated by the silver leaf \"wish paper\" available only at Chinese New Year, intended for carrying written hopes up in smoke to ancestors. This possibility links to the subterranean event in the Crypt, described in the chapter \"Cathedral: A reflection on pilgrimage and hermeneutics.\" Liminal thresholds are indicated, between ourselves and ancestors, ourselves and future possible lives or interpretations. Maybe it's steel, not silver, and the influence, or necessary archetype, is Mars, not Luna. This is a journey of initiation, involving trials and courage. Dedication: les Gargouilles, which marks the start of the \"Cathedral\" chapter, concerns the gargoyles, fixed into their positions, yet shifting in their species allegiance and domains of mobility and ambience. Do they fly? Or leap? Swim? Climb? Slither? (and what of the mysterious Hand that appears amongst them?). The gargoyles ask \"How should we make our contribution? What ought we to notice? To observe?\" Down at the corner of Island, at the Port of Entry, the gargoyles appear stacked like totems on the skull of the horse, evoking the racing horse/cavalier/ Quixotic energy of : Red Labyrinth. Together they function as the Guardian of the territory. The Island's shoreline is marked by Les vestiges des pontons at one end and Mont St Michel at the other. Both are \"merveilles,\" products of commitment and dedication of human ingenuity, effort, and resources, built in the service and defence of ideals. They are not easily reached, located where time and tides must be considered. They mark both the edge of the world and the end of one. Aporia of discourse, marking the chapter \"Parish: An essay about coming Home,\" has an earlier piece, Blue Labyrinth, at the centre, like its Red Labyrinth companion referenced in Les Gargouilles, it is an expression of the duality of the labyrinth, in this 71 case the sorrowful path, the Via dolorosa. The stairwells illustrate a scene from childhood, the \"downstairs\" world of incomprehensible adult conflict floating unmitigated to the \"upstairs\" world of frightened children sent to their rooms but peering instead over the banister. The figure falling away was a character in the adult dramas both domestic and marine, and Lyle Wilson's orca whale, now reconfigured as a hoped-for saviour dolphin, the sort promised by Socrates if only we would take courage and start across the untracked seas. It is not clear whether the man in the picture will participate in such an engagement. Alternative meanings go uninvoked, marking the start of Chapter 8, shows the coastline far below the action going on between the cupids and the humans up in the stratosphere. This piece refers to the Massif Central of canonical knowledge as a backdrop to the drama of Eros' desire to be born in Sara Kofman's essay \"Beyond Aporia?\" on Plato's explanation in the Symposium of the birth of Eros. Here Eros is represented by Raphael's fat putti shooting arrows at the vulnerable bits of his father Poros (\"means\") and his mother Pena (\"want\") whom Poros appears to be shoving aside in his hurry to get where he is going. This piece presents the dilemma of decision-making throughout the research process, and mourns all the wonderful material that was pushed out of consideration, \"off the island.\" De-Coding 2 To express different qualities of voice and horizon, | utilised a range of fontery, mostly in the Laboratory section.

The sensation of being drawn into a mystery increased as the path opened up by these encounters led into areas of knowledge that were completely unfamiliar. The subject coincided with the form of the learning it dictated: in the constant sense of movement, of feeling one's way along in the dark \u2014 hastening**\u2014without knowing where the goal might lie, each hard-won flash of comprehension leading to a turn into the next stage of exploration, with the occasional glimpse of an overview, and always the awareness of being lured towards something awe-ful and irresistible, as in Rosenstieh!'s perception of the labyrinth as a metaphor of interdisciplinary research (1980, p. 95):\u00b0' I abandon now the nightmare of this unpredictable Minotaur, lying in ambush in an unknown crossroad, that is to say, everywhere and nowhere. And, faithful to the genealogy of the myth, I substitute for him the seduction, properly said of the bull, this white-skinned creature that emerges from the marine waters. The seduction omnipresent in all labyrinths. The call to exploration, the fascination of the area of research. >> numen: \"divine, spiritual,\" numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self.\" The Idea of the Holy (1958) \u00b0\u00a2 Labyrinth walks are frequently accompanied by the music of the Taiz\u00e9 community, a form of chanting, easily learned and harmonised. The words and melody of De Noche, \"By night we hasten in darkness, to search for living water, only our thirst leads us onward, only our thirst leads us onward,\" express the embodied experience of seeking intellectually, emotionally, spiritually, imaginatively. See Appendix 10 for words and music [http://www.taize.fr/en_rubrique12.html de recherche. \u00bb The white bull of Queen Pasiphie's obsession recalls the form Zeus took to lure away the Phoenician princess Europa before abducting her across the sea to Crete, where she gave birth to his three sons, including Minos, later King of Crete and husband of Pasipha4e. See Appendix 1. 74 Artress' Walking a Sacred Path provided the initial orientation to the terrain. Reading it is an immersion in spiritual autobiography and Christian meditation, multilayered descriptions seen through what Artress later came to describe as the \"kaleidoscope lens\" of the labyrinth \u2014 alongside an account of the interconnected histories of European intellectual thought, the Catholic Church, and the imagination. There is a diagnostic focus: as an Episcopalian priest and a licensed psychotherapist trained in object relations theory, Artress found both traditions falling short in alleviating what she called the \"spiritual hunger\" of our time. Meanwhile, she observed, institutions of all kinds had become increasingly outmoded and ineffective, and \u2014 this back in 1995 \u2014 reaction to the planetary pressure for change had grown more fearful, ideologically polarized, and violent. From a psychoanalytic perspective, this was due to a basic imbalance in the culture between the faculties of rational thought and imagination following the flight, during the Reformation, from the \"saturation of religious atmosphere\" and the concretization of thought in image in the late Middle Ages: Every thought seeks expression as an image, but in ... assuming a definitive figurative shape thought loses its ethereal and vague qualities, and pious feeling is apt to resolve itself in the image. As individual piety, this tendency to apply religious conceptions to all things and at all times is a deep source of saintly life. As a cultural phenomenon this same tendency harbours grave dangers. Religion penetrating all relations in life means a constant blending of the spheres of holy and of profane thought. Reformist writing ... warns of the evil of superfluity. (Huizinga, 1954, p. 152) *8 Thomas Berry describes it as \"a dream or entrancement that has lost the integrity of its meaning and entered an exaggerated and destructive manifestation. This has happened often enough with political ideologies and religious visionaries. Yet there is no dream or entrancement in the history of the Earth that has wrought the destruction that is taking place in the entrancement with industrial civilization. Such entrancement must be considered as a profound cultural disorientation. It can be dealt with only by a corresponding deep cultural therapy\" (1999, p. 165). 75 Current understanding of the imagination\" indicates that its products ought not to be taken literally or at face value, treated idolatrously or demonised, but examined critically and reflectively, a process of discernment which distinguishes metaphor and creative initiative from disordered thinking and impulse, and maintains a necessary balance and communication between faculties.\" Unlike the fourteenth century, when \"the human faculty of the imagination was not empowered by sufficient rationality, today, rationality is not sufficiently empowered by the imagination\" (p.112). As a result, \"our sense of the whole\"\u2014a capacity for dwelling in the gestalt\u00ae\\\u2014 \"was lost. Unity is conceptually and experientially beyond the grasp of human awareness until we unify reason and image\" (p.122). One way to glimpse this unity is through intentional participation in the labyrinth experience. Conceptualizing Unity The section on medieval geometry introduced a practical framework for conceptualising this perceived sense of the whole. Artress tells the story of how she and her colleagues had gone to Chartres Cathedral planning to walk the labyrinth. After clearing away the rows of chairs which, at that time, generally covered it,\" the group managed to accomplish their mission, joined by a number of tourists who happened along and took the opportunity to walk as well. The 19 Patel Ste \u00b0\u00b0 \"Imagination can be the main workhorse of effective learning if we yoke it to education's central tasks... All knowledge is human knowledge and all knowledge is the product of human hopes, fears, and passions. To bring knowledge to life in students' minds we must introduce it to students in the context of human hopes, fears, and passions in which it finds its fullest meaning. The best tool for doing this is the imagination.\" Egan, 2005, pp. xii-xiit) \u00b0\u00b0 The command to \"Test all spirits\" would be the biblically informed approach, e.g. Paul says in 1 John 4:1, \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.\" oA configuration or pattern of elements so unified as a whole that it cannot be described merely as a sum of its parts. From German Gestaltqualitdt (1890, introduced by German philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels, 1859-1932), from Middle High German gestalt \"form, of stellen \"to place, arrange.\" As a school of psychology, it was founded c.1912. Fritz Perls was instrumental in introducing Gestalt theory to North American psychotherapeutic thought. \u00b0? The French did not always share the Americans' seemingly boundless enthusiasm for reviving the past, having a rather different association with their national history pertaining to relations between Church and State since the Revolution. Chartres Cathedral itself is a national monument as well as a functioning place of worship. 76 Afterwards they took measurements of the pattern with the intention of making one back home in San Francisco at Grace Cathedral. None of their efforts looked right until Richard Feather Anderson introduced them to the idea of the invisible thirteen-pointed star in the centre, the means by which the spacing of the central rosette petals and path-width are established. Critchlow's version of this mysterious construction, reproduced above, was illustrated in the book, but the procedure was not. Artress was convinced of the importance of this particular characteristic of the labyrinth, citing Pythagoras and energy flow \u2014\"The invisible star empowers the labyrinth ...it establishes the pattern for the flow of energy that allows the seeker to have solid and integrative experiences\"\u2014 as contributing factors in labyrinth experience.\" The possibility of identifying external factors in the event my colleague had described was intriguing. Without a doubt her experience had been \"solid and integrative,\" but it was entirely interior. The labyrinth, on the other hand, was delineated, unchanging, and externally visible. Or most of it was. I was sceptical: if the star was invisible and there was no obvious method for constructing it, how could one know it was there, or whether the designers had intended it to be in place? Either it was there or it was not. If it were in place, how could one determine its particular effect among other environmental factors, whether geometric, architectural, or another more arcane system of human-topology interface? Were these even appropriate questions? Where had Critchlow come up with the idea? It appeared to be part of a much larger body of knowledge that was looking alarmingly like mathematics! Edging towards mathematics Mathematics had not been an area of triumph for me in high school. While the compass and straight-edge themselves were most satisfactory tools, the idea that Euclid's theorems contained deeper significance had not registered in any way consciously. I certainly did not recall Mr. Hope mentioning the metaphysical potential of the constructions to the Grade 11 geometry class. \u00b0 <The number 13 most likely comes from the Pythagorean ratios that were used to lay out Chartres. As a prime number, it is an irreducible expression of the Prime Mover found in Greek thought...In numerology, it is the number of Christ\u201412+1...13 is symbolic of the thirteen full moons of the lunar year... A labyrinth walker turns towards the center thirteen times during the walk.\" p. 64. 77 Recent skirmishes with the wholly Other of undergraduate courses in functions and statistics were associated more with terror than the awe of mysterium tremendum et fascinans, in spite of the swoopy elegance of function graphs. Carl Sandburg's observation that \"Arithmetic is numbers you squeeze from your head to your hand to your pencil to your paper till you get the answer\" was some consolation. With a mixed feeling of trepidation and adventure that would become familiar in the ensuing months, I hunted down the reference for the original diagram in the Architectural Association Quarterly.\" (See the section \"Reading Critchlow\" in Chapter 6, \"Understanding the labyrinth\" for my account of the content.) To a neophyte the range of Critchlow's article was astonishing, a collection of interconnected ideas flashing like light in a crystal, magnifying and illuminating facets as the historical perspective shifted: Critchlow's amplification on Macrobius' Commentary on Cicero's Dream of psychological individuation... and polygons. What did that mean? Visual energy? Kinaesthetic energy? Was this of the same order as the mysterious flow and problematic obstruction of chi in Chinese medicine, martial arts, and Jeng shui? Or was it like dowsing? (Dowsing?? Should I even be thinking of reading about dowsing? Was this a blind alley? Academically insupportable? Zeus in disguise?) Finally came a clue from another perspective: Critchlow elsewhere explicated the contemplative approach which understands geometry to require direction, the movement of a line between two specific points, giving a single unit of measurement in the relationship between two things, while the introduction of a third point generates geometric pattern and introduces the concept of threeness, the \"unfolding of multiplicity from the duality of two\" p.102). 64 Critchlow, K., Carroll, J., Vaughan-Lee, L. Chartres Maze, A Model of the Universe (London, RILKO, 1976). An earlier article with the same title appears in Architectural Association Quarterly, 5, 2 (1973), 11-20. The diagram of the thirteen point star is reproduced in Artress, p. 63. 78 This pattern of unfolding is discernible throughout nature and the universe, expressed most clearly in the familiar @ ratio (the Golden Proportion, 1:1.618...) and Fibonacci\u00ae Series such as the whole number sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... illustrated in the logarithmic \"nautilus shell\" V 2 spiral, a model of growth throughout our human \"learning nature,\" as well. This was my inroad into contemplative geometry. In the quest to identify the environmental factors in Joan's breakthrough, the reading and drawing elements of my research method were guided by Daedalian characters \u2014architects, inventors, engineers\u2014tracing the origins of geometric-cosmological thought. The name of Tons Brun\u00e9s, a Danish engineer with a fascination for the use of geometry in ancient architecture, cropped up in a bibliography. Mirabile dictu\u2014wondrous to relate\u2014 a rare copy of The Secrets of Ancient Geometry and Its Use appeared shortly thereafter, opening up an avenue for thinking about philosophical geometry. In these two dense volumes, Brun\u00e9s speculates in vivid detail on scenarios of the prehistoric origins, relates the history and practices of temple geometry (Egyptian, Greek, Medieval European), analyses the geometry of major works of art, architecture, pottery, and symbol systems including numerals, cuneiform, and the alphabet, and probes the implications of these spatial relationships in the contemporary environment. A major component of Brun\u00e9s' work is a detailed procedure for division of the circle's circumference, square and the plane into many parts, using the approach of the original practitioner-masons. It is a system of experiential learning. Working through the constructions is a form of educational recapitulation, creating a portal through which their thinking could be accessed experientially while consolidating the material I had been learning! I was very excited about this. Lawlor argues that invariant relationships in contemplative geometry, such as the root rectangles and Vesica Pisces, are more readily apprehended by the intuitive, pattern-recognising, gestalt-forming right hemisphere than the sequential, logical, analytical left hemisphere alone. Constructing the nautilus spiral of V2 \u00b0\u00b0 The mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, profoundly influenced Leonardo da Vinci among others. \u00b0\u00b0 What a pleasure it was to construct this diagram, with pencil and compasses at first, then digitally. It is a satisfying shape to unwind across the graph lines, as it transforms itself from number sequence into curves within squares, with a little daedalian tinkering to line up the arcs. Fibonacci, | salute you. 79 squares for example, \"one experiences the fact of geometric growth through the image of the square with its diagonal which forms the side of a second square ... an unreasoned certainty absorbed by the mind from the actual experience of executing the drawing,\" thereby making the link between the most concrete (form and measure) and the most abstract realms of thought. Re-enacting the genesis of these forms along the principles of evolution, \"raises our own patterns of thought to these archetypal\u00ae levels,\" activating \"the force of these levels to penetrate our mind and thinking... and enliven our intuition\" (Lawlor, p.14). Now Joan's experience in the labyrinth was beginning to gain some traction in the realm of geometry! To me this was a clear sign that what had happened had been no coincidence, that the medieval designers knew what they were doing. I felt as if I were time travelling into the minds and intellectual world of these inventors \u2014 our ancestors!\u2014 only to find, when I investigated their history, that they, too, were getting reacquainted with their predecessors, as we saw in Chapter 6, in the Twelfth Century Renaissance. \u00b0' Three registers or levels of reality are the archetypal, an ideal, concerned with universal processes or dynamic functions independent of structure; the typa/\u2014 existent, diverse, variable, the typical; between these two, the ectypal form \u2014a copy moulded and distinct from an origina]. Lawlor, p. 6 80 A pause on the Path: On an excursion with root 2 After the prolonged immersion in the history of medieval thought and education, it was time to consolidate and review. I had read (and practiced where appropriate) Artress, Critchlow, polygons, Lawlor's esoterica, all manner of strings as layout; history and construction with Brun\u00e9s; Scholasticism, dialectics, Masonic geometry, Gothic cathedrals and the newly emerging research methods to understand them. The 12 century was beginning to feel less remote and strange, although the accomplishments of the scholars and artists of that period were extraordinary and humbling. It was an effort not to apply the standards of my own era, but to keep in the foreground a sensorial image of what the reality might have been like. It was also a challenge not to keep wandering deeper into the dark woods of this lovely historical period, with its one foot in Antiquity and the other poised on the brink, so comfortingly like our own current upheaval and possible Renaissance. My mind felt like the little \u00a5 2 construction, as my understanding grew and encompassed what I already knew, in light of each expansion into new breadths and depths. I wondered whether such a form could illustrate and explicate how the mind wanders down the paths that each of the authors and subjects opened up, finding itself inscribed and textured with each new perspective when it returns to the starting point, changed. How would a diagram represent wandering and focusing on some arcane area amongst the multitudes of possibility? Along with some other people... What does thinking together look like, in geometrical form? eee Brainstorming? How might interdisciplinary thinking be diagrammed? It was time to start back to the post-Modern with my collection of shards. I remembered my Classics professor who spent every summer at a dig in Algeria. I wondered how it would feel to unearth artefacts that had laid hidden undisturbed for 2000 years. What a thrill it had been, visiting my curator friend at the Royal Ontario Museum who let me hold Roman coins\u2014 a handful of them!\u2014from a payroll cache, on loan from the Ashmolean Museum. A helmet from the battlefield at Marathon, close-up, same visit. Someone's helmet. Someone's pay. Someone's idea. The cathedral as library and text: Pediahaptic learning While I was pondering the idea of what image could represent interdisciplinary research, enthusiasm among the architecture students for Ben Nicholson's exhibition Thinking the Unthinkable House, on display in Montreal at the McGill School of Architecture, led me to his website.* The range of ideas there was far-reaching, edgy and subversive (the \"suburbo-mythic\"; the idea that any academy or institution was \"vulnerable to collage\"). Nicholson's persona of \"collage-terrorist\" was engaged, engaging, and beautifully rendered, the drawings each an \"elegy for its own lost moment\" (Krell, 1997, p.8). In the essay accompanying the exhibition the question is raised: How does an architect, or anyone both inspired and disciplined, sustain the flash of insight through the hours and days and sometimes years\u2014the \"interminable burden of careful execution\"\u2014to bring the vision to realisation?\" This reminded me of the cathedral builders, who sustained their individual efforts over decades on projects they were unlikely ever to see completed. Included in the exhibition was Nicholson's drawing of the \"family tree for geometry.\"\" It was an epiphany to see how his ideas had grown from that starting point. I wanted to rush back to my studio and respond to Nicholson's mixture of reverence for the ancient and hip post-modernism, scholarly discipline and playful creativity. As homo artifex ludensque, he had found, in \u00b08 Ben Nicholson, Thinking Unthinkable House, CD-ROM ISBN 0-941548-35-X, 1997. www. bennicholson.com. \"Under Foot and Between the Boards in the Laurentian Library\" \u00abFour years must have been plenty of time,\" comments Krell about Nicholson's work being criticized for insufficient social conscience, \"for a confident social vision to fade...

Finally the magnificent tectractys is formed to complete the landscape of antique knowledge of geometry.\" http://bennicholson.com/ma/mahome.htm Accessed 5/20/2006 81 Pavement Panels as Library Catalogue system: It is fitting that this visual pediahaptic test of intellectual limits would take place ina building given over to the assembly of a body of knowledge. ... The library as a document, in which the floor is a plane upon which secrets of the age are inscribed ... Instead of being written as a text, this \"Codex of the Mannerist Spirit\" is indelibly cut into the floor. The structural import of the panels would have left their rightful place under the pondering footsteps of the scholars and become induced into the body through walking. Ben Nicholson, 1997 82 reconnecting with Antiquity, that \"the sources just discovered had perhaps long been accessible but had long remained unproductive for want of some spirit to breathe upon the waters ... 'Renaissance' is a spiritual initiative.\" (Chenu, p.4). This sense of discovery glowed in the section of the exhibition concerned with an investigation of the Reading Room of the Laurentian Library, designed by Michelangelo for the Medici family church complex of San Lorenzo in Florence.\" A \"basilica\" format library, the Laurentian was a publicly accessible collection of 2978 books, carefully chosen to represent the branches of sacred and profane knowledge deemed appropriate for public consumption. The books and manuscripts were chained, roughly 25 books to each reading carrel, in a series of interconnected desks. The collection was arranged by subject and categorized by well established standards so that the visitor's journey began by an introduction to the tools for learning and lead on to divine knowledge (1997, p. 68).\" The books of the Bible, books on Canon law, collections of sermons, and the Christian philosophers were customarily located in the desks on the east side in the basilica system; pagan and profane writers, including the classical philosophers, poets, and related commentaries were on the west. Latin and Italian books were kept in the Reading Room, Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew books were kept in a separate compartment at the front. Especially valuable books, deemed inflammatory at the time, and papers and documents relevant to the family or institution connected with the library, were kept locked up. His curiosity sparked by a photograph of the library under renovation, Nicholson undertook an intensive exploration of the significance of the panels that were revealed on the tile floor in \" It was commissioned by Pope Clement VII in 1523 and opened to the public 48 years later in 1571 by his distant cousin, Grand Duke Cosimo I. 7 The architect's view: \"On the east side of the Reading Room were texts covering the Poets, The Trivium and the Holy Fathers of the Church. On the west side, the books were organized according to Aristotle's Tree of Knowledge. Thus, as the scholar walked down the 150' length of the Reading Room, the subjects of the books, on both sides of the Reading Room, would become more intense: when he reached the far end of the room, he would feel the white heat of the Pentateuch on the left and the Greek metaphysicians to the right.\" 83 relation to the layout of the collection. Originally designed as two long rows of fifteen panels each mirrored on either side of a long central aisle, the pavement has long been concealed under a wooden dais. Rediscovered in 1774 by the librarian Alberto Biscioni, when one of the eighty- eight desks set out in two rows on the dais in the long hall needed repairs, the designs were engraved for the frontispiece of the librarian's catalogue of the Greek and Hebrew books in the Library's collection, and trapdoors were put into the dais to allow some limited access. Structural repairs to the building in 1928 provided the opportunity for the fifteen panels on the West side to be photographed, and the entire floor was laid bare during the removal of the books and furniture for safekeeping during World War II. Working from these photographs, which are now on display in the Library, Nicholson and his graduate students documented, mapped, analyzed, and painted enlarged reproductions of the elaborate tiles, each one different and each significant in terms of the esoteric geometry encoded in the design. Nicholson's detailed analysis of the geometry of these tiles and their significance in relation to the relationship between the books chained in collections at each adjacent desk presents compelling evidence of the educative \"pediahaptic\" purpose of architecture in the scholarly context. Most intriguing was his discussion of the technique of construction of the Antique Rosette compared with the advances Michelangelo had made upon it in the Medici tile. Located beside the carrel containing Plato's Timaeus, it is a reworking of a rosette pattern such that the state of incommensurability which Plato discusses is illustrated in a subtle and explicit diagram. It was to sharpen the perception of such underlying structure that the School of Chartres trained its students. (see Appendix 5) But what snagged my attention was the \"conundrum\" buried in note 29: They measure 4/13th of each 24th part of the pitch circle: this prompts a curious mathematical conundrum because the arc of a circle cannot be divided into uneven parts using geometry (note 29*). This component of the design questions known geometric construction methods of the time. *note 29 The only known method is to wrap a flexible measuring stick round the circumference, straighten the stick and subdivide, unwrap the stick and transfer the divisions onto the arc. 84 A pause on the Path: A research crossroads 24e- 3? 9 ee + - \u00a9. SOO * Amidst Nicholson's brilliant illumination of 16\" century thought, learning theory, and ambient geometry, the \"curious mathematical conundrum\" of note 29 stood out in stark contrast. It was a research crossroads: I could continue to follow after him, retracing his entire archaeologico-geometric expedition into deep Mannerist code- breaking, and his myriad primary sources beyond that. Because the website is set up to make accessible Nicholson's thought process in all its scribbly dailiness, full of sketches and questions and notes-to-self and co-researchers \u2014 the idiosyncratic \"working drawing\" quality deeply satisfying to artisans \u2014 his methodology is clear and discernible. A visit there feels like an invitation to participate in a very big adventure. [Visiting the site on a later hermeneutic pass revealed how deeply impressed I was by this transparency of method in research, creativity, and pedagogy] Or I could stop at this juncture of light and dark, where the known met the unknown, and pursue my own little piece of the \"kaleidoscope,\" go deeper into its mysterious inner working. My determination to solve the mystery of the division of the circle into thirteen was greater than ever. I decided to go after the problem that Critchlow had posed in his diagram of the thirteen pointed star alleged to be at the centre of the labyrinth. I was sure that if I could figure it out, I would have found a way across time into the minds of the medieval designers, by recapitulating pre- Cartesian thought. A conundrum! Maybe even a null hypothesis! Who could resist? 85 Search for proof of Critchlow's 13-point star by the slightly initiated It was not yet clear which combination of triangles and rectangles would produce Critchlow's construction, but Brun\u00e9s' approach indicated a possible solution for the 13-gon that would be contextually appropriate. The intervals of the twelve knot cord may have suggested the vertices of a thirteen sided polygram, but if Brun\u00e9s were correct, the cathedral builders would have used a more integrated, holistic, and structurally based underpinning method than that. After working through the constructions in Brun\u00e9s and Lawlor's exercises, I began to experiment, first with compass and straightedge on paper, and then with a primitive drawing program on the computer, the Cabri geometry software at that point being outside both my technical capability and the parameters of historical \"equivalency\" I had set for the project. But, although the experiments were challenging and the results often surprising, none of the constructions J came up with felt right, none had the elegant ease, logic and rectitude of the figures in Lawlor, Brun\u00e9s, and Euclid (see Appendix 6). In some frustration, I sought help at the Math Building, and was given the name of a geometer who might be interested in the problem and have some time to advise me. Dr. Leroy Dickey was a tall man with a long grey beard, looming in the doorway of a small office stacked high with towers of books, papers, journals, assignments and projects balanced precariously. Perched on every horizontal surface and dangling by threads from the ceiling frames were cardboard and balsawood constructions of polyhedra and conic sections. The relationships enjoyed by these entities were a specialty of Dr. Dickey's. I cautiously made my way through the maze, found a place to perch, and explained what had happened up until reaching an impasse with the 13-gon, and that I needed some guidance as to how to get a grasp of medieval mathematics \u2014 and motivation\u2014that ] believed were key to the enterprise of understanding Joan's experience. Students of the Independent Studies Program at Waterloo were encouraged to undertake such forays to request advisory assistance.\" \u00ae Independent Studies is a self-directed learning program, leading to a Bachelor of Independent Studies (BIS).

Accessed 5/22/2006. 86 Dr. Dickey seemed bemused by the request, but he was gracious.\" The sensation of being the Apprentice in Fantasia to Dr. Dickey's Sorceror was noticeable; all that was missing was the tall pointy hat decorated with sigils. He reached into the back of the desk drawer for his compass and straightedge, \"and that IS where they're kept, these days!\" he said, before showing me on Cabri\" how to construct what I was doing on paper. In his opinion, no such division of the circle into thirteen was possible, nor were medieval builders likely to have thought so either, being no doubt sensible fellows who used a rough-and-ready builders' string technique, \"Good enough for a stonecutter,\" and it was a waste of time to pursue it. I persisted, maintaining that, from all that I had been reading, Medieval architecture was unified and inclusive and the architect would have had access to the esoteric system of proportional \"Sacred Geometry\" in keeping with the rest of the cathedral. Why would he have changed methodology on so crucial a finishing flourish? Dr. Dickey relented, and agreed to help me check with Cabri some of the constructions I had come up with, for accuracy. But what I really should do, he said, was look at what contemporary 20\" Century researchers thought about medieval mathematical accomplishments, and for that I should look into the work of Pierre Rosenstieh! on the Chartres labyrinth. The idea of the pediahaptic in Nicholson's investigation of the Laurentian Library provoked an \"Aha!\" We threaded our way out through the towers of papers, down the hall past the graphics of fractals decorating the bulletin boards, and into the long narrow room where the Mathematical Review Index archives were kept. It was a massive collection. The procedure was to look up an author's name in the American Mathematical Society author index, and find the list of numbers representing that individual's publications. In the Math Review Index would be an abstract of each paper. Then, I could find its original source and look up the actual paper. Another way was to find the Index number of the subject area, for example, \"Chartres.\" First, I should visit with the Reference Librarian for Mathematics at Now Emeritus. http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ljdickey/#teach Accessed 5/22/2006. \" See for software access http://www.cabri.com/v2/pages/en/index.php and educational examples _http://mathforum.org/dynamic/cabri.Jinks.html. Accessed5/22/2006 87 the Davis Library. When I had found Rosenstiehl's papers on labyrinths, I could bring them back to Dr. Dickey and we would go from there. \"He's an interesting fellow, you will like him,\" my professor cheerfully assured me. At the library, the Math librarian-Ariadne was friendly and enthusiastic. We found a list of 35 papers under Rosenstiehl's name (as of 10/6/98), in many different classifications. The paper I particularly wished to see, \"How the Path of Jerusalem in Chartres separates the birds from the fish\" had the following number: 00A05 01A35 52A45, and could be found in the M.C. Escher: Art and Science conference proceedings. (The whole array can be found in Appendix 7. It gives new meaning to the term \"information architecture\") Rounding up Rosenstiehl's oeuvre added another several layers to the hermeneutic build- up. There were many wonders classified as 01A35 (Medieval), tantalizing titles such as Brigitte Englisch's dissertation from Ruhr University, The Quadrivium and the Computus as indicators for continuity and renewal of the exact sciences between classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, ...glimpses of whole other parallel universes. It was hard to turn away (Was it a trap? Or a crucial piece of information that would illuminate everything?): the project of tracking down Rosenstiehl's publications on labyrinths easily opened up worlds enough to occupy anyone. The \"Path of Jerusalem\" article was in a book in the library's collection ... Oh no! out on six month loan to a faculty member <mutters to self...why would anyone need it that long?> \"Could you possibly tell me which one? Might he be persuaded to make a copy of this one short little article for me? He would? How kind of him!\"... but it was a culmination of years of research, and the papers leading up to it What about these other publications? Nowhere to be found ... \"Tt seems that Professor X is retiring and clearing out his files, he wondered if perhaps there might be some things of interest to you?\" This stack of Rosenstiehl articles with the Great Man's handwritten notes in the margin?! Yes! \"How very kind of you, thank you so much...\"... were in the original French. 88 Trap or opportunity? Weeks later, high school French severely tested, I went back to Dr. Dickey, translations in hand. 76 Reading Rosenstiehl The graph theorist-Daedalus\" was connecting linguistics, depth-first search technique, and a- centric system modelling in relation to computer programming, interdisciplinary research and social organisation, from a mathematical perspective. Labyrinthology was just one of his areas of interest. The material on a-centric organisation in \"Les Mots du Labyrinthe\" was particularly intriguing on account of its presentation in 1979 at Roland Barthes' seminar on interdisciplinary research, where Gilles Deleuze was also a participant. Deleuze and Guattari had published Rhizome three years previously, and Rosenstiehl referred to \"this revolutionary little book\" during a discussion on path-threading as a model for non-hierarchical network communication, rhizomatic and multiply-accessible, rather than (or alongside) traditional \"arborescent\" structures of power and domination.\" The spirit of liberation, of radical \"becoming-rhizomatic\" that erupted later in 4 Thousand Plateaus, was perceptible in Rosenstiehl's linking of graph theory to social construction and the purpose of education: The rule of Tarry\" is the minimal order, the rule necessary and sufficient, according to the theory, for \"search\" any labyrinth. And beyond the rule? There is liberty. The rule forbids, the rest is permitted. ... I would like fo open a parenthesis. There is a profusion of \"searches\" possible in a labyrinth, and the choice of departure-crossroad is arbitrary. One can say that it is so of universal labyrinths. I see mathematics as multiple labyrinths, without imposed entries, with certain labyrinths newly accessible in each era. Though \"\u00a9 The full account is found in Appendix 8 here to multicursal mazes with many decision points, rather than unicursal labyrinths. The Chartres labyrinth is the subject of two later articles, \"Le Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale,\" and \"How the 'Path of Jerusalem' separates birds from fish.\" \" Tarry's theory: a traveller is assured of search a connected finite labyrinth, that is to say, of taking each corridor once in each direction on departure from a first, arbitrarily chosen crossroad, if the voyager imposes upon herself in any crossroad other than the first, not to take again the corridor of discovery except as the last recourse (Rosenstiehl, 1980, p. 98). 89 it concerns universal dedales, each voyager is nearly assured of an original exploration \u2014 that is to say of a useful look in a direction of interest for the others. Creativity is for everyone. J open a second parenthesis, \\ call to mind the cubists who were all painting the same subject. J close this parenthesis. Does this vision of liberty not make intolerable the feeling of resentment towards the academisms which want to impose a \"path-taking,\" an order of theorems, a natural piling up of theory, from which pour out official scholastic programs to cram into children, and an official age for asking oneself such and such a question, and to be astonished? (1980, pp. 99-100) In contrast to this hierarchical and authoritarian vision, he uses the example of the spontaneous, collective, acentric decision of bees to swarm to illustrate the concept he proposes of the collective hapax,\u00ae a change of state when critical mass is reached in social organisations, whether beehive or interdisciplinary research seminar. Acentrism is characteristic of \"'ant-hill\" societies; the network of finite automata in human communication systems, whether biological or technological, is the spontaneous emergence of this, in spite of the historical imposition of hierarchy upon language, concept, and social organisation. \"To abstract the labyrinth, there is perhaps a hope of stammering out the acentred ... intended to mean a language (p. 103).*' Was there something about the construction of the labyrinth pattern-as-environment that had an impact on cognition, perception, social relations? Is there an internal hapax of synapses? An algorithm of political will ? A mathematics of collective action? *\u00b0 a technical term in linguistics: hapax legomenon, word a le is a term Deleuze uses to suggest a syntactical treatment of language in the project to push it to the limit of meaning creation. He distinguishes this from \"begayer,\" to stutter. See the transcript of Claire Parnet's interview with Deleuze, L'Ab\u00e9c\u00e9daire de http://www.langlab.wayne.edu/CStivale/D-G/ABC3.html . \"To make language itself stutter, at the deepest level of style, is a creative process that runs through all great works.... 'stammering' is putting into suspense, whereas 'stuttering' is a repetition, a proliferation, a bifurcation, a deviation.\" (Deleuze. \"Re-presentation of Essays http://www.utdallas.edu/pretext/PT3. 1/ensample/style.htm ) Accessed 25/05/2006. 90 Barthes had died tragically in the aftermath of a traffic accident since the exuberant earlier gathering of interdisciplinary researchers, and the elegiac change in tone is noticeable in the \"Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale, ou I'\u00e9loge de |'heuristique\" (1982). Rosenstiehl frames the paper as a tribute to Barthes' contribution to heuristics, writing vividly of the visceral experience of walking in a labyrinth (the fierce octagonal one at St. Quentin) and drawing a parallel between its multivocal function as an idealized metaphor, open to anyone, \"the place where one will never cease stepping outside of logic...a method for the arrangement of a multitude of metaphors\" (p. 793), and the phrasing characteristic of Barthes' inquiry.* He advances the use of parenthesage, establishing that the \"words\" or concatenation into sentences reveal three complete traverses around the four quadrants of the labyrinth, interspersed with \"blind\" (or \"mute\") short runs (see Appendix 8). Continuing with the analogy to inquiry method, he says the thread is a kind of writing that provides a structure of parenthesis, a method of proceeding, an informational resolution of a unicursal sort, but it does not \"authorize\" which avenues inquiry ought to pursue. The labyrinth at St. Quentin In the \"Winter Garden Photograph\" section of the essay, concerned with Barthes' famous examination of his response to the photograph of his mother as a little girl, the discernment between the studium of the canonical \u2014the labyrinth of \"all the photographs in the world\" containing its secret object at the centre, \"monster or treasure\"\u2014 and the deeply apprehended significance signalled by the punctum, of \"what constituted that thread that drew me\" (p. 796) is Barthes' perceptual legacy with which Rosenstiehl consoles the bereaved community of researchers, coalescing for me how *? In his critical enterprise, concerned with developing a rigorous approach to the most minute detail of writing, Barthes proceeds scientifically, beginning with well articulated problems. He asks questions, turns them round and transforms them. When he is ready to make a decisive step, to present a personal choice, he anticipates his critics with the expression \"one can say that...\" The form is delicate, it does not impose, in contrast to all the arrogance with which so often science clothes itself (\"it must...\" can say that...\" is an invitation not to overlook other routes, but also the announcement of an essential formula, in short form, sufficient unto itself, and which will change your view on the troubling subject in which he has you engaged. (p. 795) My translation. 91 profoundly idiosyncratic and personal our curiosity is, and at the same time, how human and communal. The article, \"How the 'Path of Jerusalem' separates birds from fish\" (1987) brought everything back round to the artist M.C. Escher and Islamic tiles from a completely different angle. Informed by the structuralist practice of searching for the underlying framework in the presenting situation, in this technical paper Rosenstiehl uses an austerity of means and a distinctly pragmatic visual approach to make a conceptual leap from the earlier theory of spatial analysis to establish a rule of alternation of string patterns for unicursal labyrinths. Beginning with the image of a tricolour labyrinth from the church of Santa Maria d' Aquiro in Rome, the path is distinguished from the two distinct, opposing walls. By means of a manipulation known as anamorphosis (illustrated at the end of Appendix 8), the circular array is cut open at the throat and reefed around into a rectangular array from which the path is then removed, to reveal a field of infinite repeats framed by the sides of the throat now morphed into exterior boundaries. Within these boundaries lies the stretched-H array of translated hexaminos, a form of symmetrical tessellation which Rosenstiehl's artist wife Agn\u00e9s renders as the merging fish and birds\u2014 before being separated by the path of the labyrinth\u2014 familiar from Escher's divisions of the plane by regular polygonal tiling. This manoeuvre identifies the fundamental elements and forms and, depending on the distribution of axes and number of concentric circuits, clarifies the systematic nesting arrangement in the throat required to avoid blind loops.\u00ae Understanding Rosenstiehl Within the paper are hints about the disparate sorts of things Rosenstiehl was playing with: a circular Japanese paper flower opening out like a fan, a uniquely coloured version of the cathedral type labyrinth, arrays of repeat polygons on crystallographic planes. None of these had appeared in the earlier explorations of the labyrinth, only the fundamental element of nested pairs were familiar from the \"Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale,\" and a preliminary version of the rule of *\u00b0 Tessa Morrison expands on the cultural application and algorithmic details and nomenclature of \"simple, alternating, transitive\" labyrinths labyrinths can be seen at http:/Awww.labyrinthsociety.org/html/medieval04.html . 92 alternation. It appeared to be a completely new approach to the problem, kaleidoscopic, right- hemispheric, intuitive and playful\u2014 even I could see that, despite having been dropped, as it were, into media res. The long traverse from initial flash of inspiration through long slow analysis \u2014the \"tedious checking\" of all 675 possible permutations of turns and circuits in \"The Path'\u2014 recalls Nicholson's determination to capture faithfully that elusive moment when the mind lights upon an object with a glimpse of its potential transfiguration; when a thing is seen both for what it is and also for what otherwise it might be, and when a course of painstaking work is initiated from a first and sudden emotion\u2014an emotion which is remembered merely by a Sketch or a remark in a notebook, and which begins to fade as soon as its presence is registered. In architecture the future of an intuition lies in the hope of being redrawn (J. Whitehead, in Krell, p. 7). In Rosenstiehl's work discussed here, three things stand out: the inventive use of metaphor to further the idea, the range of interdisciplinary influences or components brought into the mix, and the affect attached to it\u2014the ebullience of \"Les Mots,\" sorrow and gravitas permeating \"Le Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale,\" the gleeful legerdemain of \"escherised\" fish + birds in \"The Path.\" These are indicators of a high functioning imaginative capacity at work. Each of these sophisticated yet accessible papers bubble over with extended metaphors conveying some very subtle ideas: mathematical concepts expressed as ants in trees and taxis in Paris, tailors with scissors, beehives full of agreement, groups of friends with blue mouths (73), grammarians, ferrymen, alembics; to describe the research process itself: Inquiry as \"grappling hook ... myopia... staring at the clouds... scratching dirt...a search for Ariadne... l'angoisse stochastique.\" Rosenstiehl proposes a number of possible realities: what if the labyrinth were an abbreviation sign\u2014could it hold a whole church? Is it a simple puzzle, or an unsolvable enigma? Is it an invitation to play, or to meditate ? What if it's a \"black box'? Suppose for a moment there is nothing but geometry! When it is invaded by essential anguish, can research still maintain its sense of play? (Rosenstiehl, 1980, 1982) Imagination by definition is \"the ability to think of things as possible\u2014the source of flexibility and originality in human thinking...enhanced by the array of discoveries and inventions made in cultural history\" (Egan, 2005, p. 220). And play \"releases the mind to reflect back on the world,\" a cognitive tool that develops the meta-level of thinking about the familiar in unfamiliar ways. In Vygotskyan terminology, play develops the zone of proximal 93 development where humans can experiment at the growth edges of their abilities and knowledge. Like the imaginative (though not necessarily imaginary) Brother Auxerre in Wright's reconstruction, playing with a compass and ruler at the edge of the known world of labyrinth design sometime around 900, tinkering with eleven circuits and a newly dropped in cross and turnabouts, until tracks were formed and thus was made the northern inner sector of the maze....a southern inner sector, then a northern outer sector, the southern outer sector ...an endlessly confusing configuration can in fact be formed simply by proceeding with a compass from one sector to the next in ...a perfect, though hidden symmetry... Sector I is mirrored by Sector IV, and Sector I by Sector III (p. 27). Simple, really. 94 Pause on the Path: Acentric thinking _\u2014 I persevered with the 13-gon construction problem, alternating between eras and mathematical languages spaced 800 years apart, to synthesize the insights of French intellectual culture about the one architectural site. Reading Rosenstiehl meant, except for \"The Path,\" which was available in English, reading and translating from French. Out on the frontiers of my skills in French and mathematics, and the user's manuals of geometry software programs, I was engrossed for what seemed like hundreds of hours in pursuit of a \"Rosetta Stone\" that would connect and make sense of the unity I was sure existed. Sacred (or Masonic, or Temple) Geometry is characteristically \"esoteric\": the geometry discussion in Timaeus is a good example of language aimed exclusively at initiates. A key tenet of both theory and practice is the idea of \"dropping\" in some unifying construction that makes sense of the entire problem but is itself invisible: e.g. adding a circle to a construction will give all the division lines and intersections of a pentagram, if you know where to put it on an otherwise merely decorative tile pattern. It was context-sensitive, continuous with the fabric of the whole edifice of which it was a part. If I could figure out a functional geometrical construction, perhaps the connection between Rosenstiehl's algorithms for threading, doubling, stacking, alternation, and tessellating, and the cosmological view envisioned by the medieval designer/iconographer and embedded as a technology in the structure of the cathedral would become clear. I was fascinated by the problem and driven to find a solution, not for the degree requirements, which I had long since met, but for its own sake. Late one night in the final week before the real deadline, I stared at the computer screen and resolved to try just one more time before giving up on it. I drew in the square around the circular labyrinth, and then thought of Rosenstiehl's \"acentric language.\" It occurred to me that if I drew the whole \"house\" around the labyrinth, it would be embedded in the octagonal form used throughout the rest of the cathedral. Seeing the labyrinth in spatial relation to the whole could change my hierarchical view to an acentric one as both the medieval architect and Rosenstiehl had been indicating all along. I needed to drop in the \"invisible\" part. T added the surrounding octagonal construction and began connecting the sight- lines with the rest of the cathedral layout. It worked! All the missing pieces fell into place, the elegant rhythms and right angles of the thirteen point star construction at the centre appearing as if a veil had fallen away. My hunch had been correct! You will find it on the following page: 95 Hunting the triskaidecagon i Construction of the thirteen poi star using the acute and right angle triangles Inscribe a circle at centre O to fill completely a base eight unit square ABCD. Lay in central vertical and horizontal axes of the square, EF and GH, to intersect at O. Construct an inverted acute angle triangle IHJ from the centre point H of the bottom line to the two quarter marks | and J on the top line. The points K and L where the edges of the triangle intersect the circle's circumference mark the vertices of the two arms of the star on either side of the central vertical axis GH. Construct a circle one eighth the diameter of the original circle, with the same centre O. Lines drawn from point G to line DC, tangent to the small circle at P and Q, will intersect the large circle's circumference at the points M and N, the intersections of the one eighth vertical lines to the left and right of the centre vertical axis GH. MGN is the first arm of the star, with centre line OG. A horizontal line RS drawn tangent to the top of the small circle is one sixteenth of the large circle's diameter in distance from the centre O, and intersects GH at point T. Construct the right angle triangles GTU and GTV where U is the intersection of GM and RS, V is the intersection of GN and RS. GH is perpendicular to RS, giving the right angles GTR and GTS. Similarly, GN intersects SO at right angle GQS and NQS. This relationship between the edges of the star's arms and their centre lines radiant from O exists between every third arm. Line ON gives a right angle SWN at W tangent to the small circle. SW can be extended to intersect the large circle at X, creating another arm of the star with centre line OS and marking the point of another arm with centre line XO. This process may be continued until all thirteen of the star's arms are generated. Is it not beautiful? 96 I was delighted with this accomplishment. It used divisions of the circle in eighths, acute and 90\u00b0 angles\u2014elements appropriate to its origins and context\u2014 and looked simple and elegant. I rushed over to Dr. Dickey's office waving the result. \"Hmn,\" he said. For my graduation I painted a version of the 13-gon construction on a sheepskin and brought it with me to the ceremony so that it might be imbued with the aura of formal recognition floating about the auditorium. Influenced by an article in a current Scientific American, as an offering for my illustrious teacher, I made a computer graphic version of it as a sangaku. I have a photograph of us together in our academic robes, him squinting (deep royal blue velvet; PhD (Wisconsin); a mathematician in the lineage of the legendary H.S.M. Coxeter, his supervisor's supervisor.*) at the graphic just before he found the error in it, me beaming, in the last moment of my life where I still believed one could (...that J could) create something perfect. As it turned out, tested on the Cabri program, my construction had a relative error of 3.96\u00b0. That was more than 7t and unacceptable, even to a stonemason. By this time Dr. Dickey was involved in finding a solution, due to his interest both in developing a way to convey geometrical construction methods by email without visual diagrams, and through his membership in the Unitarian Church, where the experiential function of labyrinths as sacred space was receiving attention. One day an email arrived. I followed the instructions and made the figures, looked hard at the gamma, drew four more lines, then drove out to Waterloo. \"If you drop in the second square, it makes an octagon. That's what the rest of the cathedral is based on. That's what they would have used!\" We looked at each other. Surprise, then wonder registered, and slowly, big grins: we had solved it. (See Appendix 6.) ** hittp://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/0598rothman.html. Sangaku problems are geometric problems of the type found on devotional mathematical wooden tablets (\"sangaku'') which were hung under the roofs of shrines or temples in Japan during two centuries of schism from the west. During the time of isolation, Japanese mathematicians developed their own \"traditional mathematics,\" which, in the 1850s, began giving way to western methods. Eric W.

Accessed 5/26/2006. 97 The search for the Beloved Object Not long after the hunt for the 13-gon, I read Fermat's Enigma, the documentary producer Simon Singh's story of Andrew Wiles' pursuit of the solution to a famous mathematical problem. The story is a classic Heroic Quest, marked by loneliness, determination, and perseverance through discouraging setbacks and the fear of wasting one's life on a fool's mission. At first I was sorry I had not read the book the year before, when I was unknowingly setting out on my own Quixotic hero's quest in mathematics. In a blaze of illumination I have since realised that of course I would not have appreciated it then. What had begun as curiosity about a rather minor sideline to my honours thesis rapidly became a research labyrinth of monstrous proportions, involving at least two distinct, distantly related disciplines between which I veered, knowing at the outset only a little about either, apart from the systemic and parallel nature of both. So when I read of Andrew Wiles' use of cross-disciplinary techniques between one area of mathematics and another, I could appreciate, in a small way, what he had done and how he might have felt in those \"moments of fulfillment and combustion\" during \"the joyful feeling of verification...[which] presumes that what has happened is what had, in fact, been predicted\" (Scheffler, 1991, p. 10). The joy of verification and the feeling of surprise are the emotions that are specifically cognitive and especially relevant to the workings of theoretical imagination. The opportunity to have such a feeling requires staying open to the possibility of surprise, being willing to accept the risk of discovering that our assumptions were incorrect and our expectations need adjustment \u2014 a transformative learning experience, in other words: Surprise may be dissipated and may evaporate into lethargy. It may culminate in confusion or panic. It may be swiftly overcome by a redoubled dogmatism. Or it may be transformed into wonder or curiosity, and so become an educative experience. Curiosity replaces the impact of surprise with the demand for an explanation; it turns confusion into question (p.15). Clearly there are pitfalls to the process, arising out of fear, unwillingness to consider the possibility of change, or simply being unprepared at that time to take advantage of the opportunity fate has thrown across the path. Habits of mind are particularly interesting as an internal obstacle because often they are a matter of perception. This is where the multi- perspectivalism and intersubjectivity suggested becoming-animal, can be so productive: \"You 98 don't know. So experiment. Either stop writing. or write like a rat!\" (1987, pp. 251, 240). O'Flaherty argues for a similar disjunction from complacency in order overcome alienation and aversion and begin to comprehend the mythology of other cultures, when she describes \"getting into the head of the fish\" as a research methodology (1988, p. 80). Forgoing certainty allows our perception to adapt long enough to appreciate another creature's world-view or situatedness, providing the scaffolding and impetus for the transformative work of the imagination. By re- framing our perceptions in both cognitive and visceral ways, intuition and image can arrive at a new staging ground, beyond the limits of outgrown assumptions. But if our perceptions change, will our attractions and repulsions also be transformed? \"Passions charge objects with emotions, making them repulsive or attractive; ... scientific passion serves as a guide in the assessment of what is of higher and what of lesser interest,\" Polanyi says (1962, p.134-35), an idea expanded in Dewey's observation that, during the investigative process, \"In thought as well as in overt action, the objects experienced in following out a course of action attract, repel, satisfy, annoy, promote and retard. Thus deliberation proceeds\" (1930, p. 192). Such a complex, fractious, and engaged relationship is evoked in Belenky's description of \"loving\" an idea, conversing with it as with a recognizable Other, the idea growing and changing along with, but distinct from, the human conversationalist (1986). This is easy for a visually trained person to imagine; it is the artist's discipline: \"Love's work consists in a fiercely experimental attitude, and in an ability (which is in the broadest sense the artist's ability) to go on getting it wrong, more or less all the time\" (Gillian Rose in Baker, p.188). Dogmatic thinking quickly kills life in this Other; Stalinist \"Tractor Art,\" timid polite art, impenetrably self-referential and self- indulgent art are tyrannies rather than dialogues. The tension lies in the accuracy of translation from the \"Other side,\" so to speak. The Medieval sense of cosmology was a murmur behind the visual device J had received. Dropping my preconceptions was the route to hearing the complexity, to entering the dialogue with the Idea. To being Answerable. But what if this was completely wrong? That weavers in particular, together with scholars and writers with whom they had much in common, tended to suffer from melancholy and all the evils associated with it, is understandable given the nature of their work, which forced them to sit bent over, day after day, straining to keep their eye on the complex patterns they created. It is difficult to imagine the depths of despair into which those can be driven who, even after the end of the working day, are engrossed in their intricate designs and who are pursued, into their dreams, by the feeling that they have got hold of the wrong thread. (Sebald, 1998, p.283) As it turned out, the feeling was prescient. The following summer at Chartres, during his lecture on the sacred geometry of the cathedral, Robert Ferr\u00e9 referred to John James's analysis\u00ae concerning Critchlow's theory of the invisible thirteen point star. The theory, which Critchlow admitted he had come up with intuitively, was deemed incorrect, although Ferr\u00e9 conceded elsewhere that \"agreement on this subject is far from universal.'*' James' geometry is elegant in its logic, contextual congruity and practical application. He draws on the medieval symbol systems of numerology and gematria,\u00ae to convey the meanings he 8\u00b0 \"Tn trying to discover the original geometry I re-examined Critchlow's suggestion...If measured through the centre of the petals there should be two parts for each petal and one for the entry, but calculations from the measurements show that this is not so. One thirteenth of the circle, measured across the facet, is 496.6mm, while the radius of the petal to the centre of the band is 480mm. The 17mm difference is appreciable. There is no way around this problem\u2014if the petals had been arranged from the lines of a thirteen pointed star the idealised geometry would have to fit the average measurements more exactly than they do. So we must seek elsewhere for the solution to the petals geometry\" (James, 1977, p. 109). See Appendix 9. 87 http://www. labyrinth-enterprises.com/proportion.html. Accessed 6/7/2006. Based on James's geometry, Ferr\u00e9 has since led the way in systematizing the layout, mass-production and marketing of portable canvas labyrinths in a variety of patterns and configurations, and the installation of permanent ones in various material. %8\u00ab | the technique of equating words and phrases with numbers by giving each letter a number. 'A' would be 1, 'B' would be 2, and so on. The sum of the letters s therefore the number of the word. Certain numbers therefore became more significant than others, and some words were re-spelt, or phrases reworded so they would coincide with the most relevant numbers\" (1977, p. 102). James finds in the layout of the turns and the linear path, the gematric spellings of MARIA EST ASSUMPTA, MARIA MATER DEL, ECCKESIA, BVM and so on. 100 claims for it on behalf of, and in keeping with, the iconography of its originators' Gnosticism, \"the Way through knowledge rather than through faith\" (1977, p. 94). Arcane to the point of impenetrability, these symbolic meanings were intentionally built into the geometry of the cathedral and the labyrinth, and would have been perceptible to the initiated at that time, in his view. If that is so, then the world of an educated medieval person must have been an extraordinarily rich environment, resonant with possible interpretations and messages. Do these symbolic meanings reverberate in us post-moderns? Recalling the impact on my unsuspecting colleague, I would hesitate to dismiss the notion outright. Something about that arrangement of lines and space enabled her to see her situation differently. Whether or not she could recognize her soul, in all the \"three-ness\" of its spiritual dimension, manifested through its spatial projection into the \"four-ness\" of earth-bound, temporal lived-through reality, and the \"seven-ness\" of their combined and transcendent integration, mattered not (although it might have been less disturbing for her had she been more extensively coached in such conceptualization than my seminar handouts allowed). What she did comprehend was the urgent need\u2014and her capacity\u2014 to honour the eternal part of herself by rescuing it from some gritty, but changeable, physical circumstances. Spiritual learning is developmental and scaffolded for a reason. It was a lot to take in all at once, for Joan. But the intention of cathedrals, and of labyrinths, comes through as a benign influence, not maleficent. Joan's insight was revealed to her, and its validity bolstered, by the sturdiness of the spatial cue: the BVM, patron saint of new initiatives, choosing to operate through the geometry of the Notre Dame cathedrals and their labyrinths. Did I regret having spent so much time and effort in the pursuit of the elusive figure? I do know, having done both, that James' version of the labyrinth's geometry is far easier to translate onto a parish hall floor with a group of volunteer artist-parishioners than Critchlow's 13-gon. This is enormously important within the ethos of accessible, public, community-based participatory art. But the original spark, pursuit, achievement (and getting it wrong), and being challenged again a year later, were forms (albeit less dramatic instances than Joan's) of what transformative learning theory identifies as \"disorienting dilemmas... events that expose a discrepancy between what a person has always assumed to be true and 101 what has just been experienced, heard or read\"\" ..and can act as a \"catalyst for transformation\" (Cranton, 2002, pp. 65-66). The need to come to terms with the impermanence of being \"right\" lead to examining the emotional investment in being \"right\" in the first place. This turned out to be part of the \"meaning scheme\" of values, attitudes, expectations and judgments that operates outside awareness, contributing to and maintaining the assumptions that comprise our point of view and habits of mind, and are generally established well before we are cognitively independent of our families and \"tribes.\" These habits of mind shape perceptions and thus our epistemologies, because \"learning tends to become narrowly defined as efforts to add compatible ideas to elaborate our fixed frames of reference\" (Mezirow, 2000, p. 18). Where I came from, an academic family in the adversarial Oxbridge model, being wrong, ill-informed, ignorant, or even intellectually a non-belligerent, was a sure way to invite scorn and public ridicule. Being \"right\" meant being aggressively confident in one's position, with references at hand and derogatory comments to enforce. One could not say, \" On peut dire que... Such certitude! That was dangerous terrain, for a youngster. Division of the circle into 13, correctly A pause in the Path: revisiting my notes from Chartres, I saw then how my capacity for critical reflection had increased because of the commitment to interrogating this one particular \"pet\" theory, always examining \"in the light of new experiences or knowledge\" what I had learned, attempting to keep an open mind, \"considering their sources, and examining underlying premises\" (Cranton, p. 65). J note, in that light, this comment on Critchlow: \"An overinterpretation of the maze of Chartres based on Macrobius proposed in ignorance of the liturgical practices within the diocese of Sens. See Kern....\" (van der Meulen, 1989, p. 377).

To walk the same way is to reiterate something deep. (Solnit, 2000, p. 69). The opportunity arose to go to France and spend five days in May at Chartres, in a gathering described as a \"Walk with Mary\" led by Lauren Artress. Sally Cuneen and Marina Warner's books on Mary were on the reading list; the Rector of the Cathedral, Chanoine Frangois Legaux, would speak to us about Marian theology. Tours of the cathedral, focusing on iconography and geometry, would be arranged. Two evenings the cathedral would be available for us to walk the labyrinth! The Path to Jerusalem itself. Chartres is southwest of Paris, in the Eure-et-Loire region. From there, I planned to meet up with my friend and follow an itinerary that led to the Normandy coast, where we could visit Mont St. Michel, Juno Beach, Bayeux, and Giverny, before returning for a week in Paris, where we had an appointment with Pierre Rosenstiehl. Personal, political, and cultural history, sacred sites, art, landscape, food and music were all on the list of longings asking to be addressed. Sorting out the approach and intentions for each category was thus an exercise of the left brain on behalf of the intuitive: if pilgrimage is purposeful journeying to significant destinations, it requires commitment to movement that alternates between intentional seeking and a state of active receptivity, a dynamic this next section expresses through voice and visuals. 104 At the Patisserie Saturday, May 8, 1999, rue des Ecoles, 5e, Paris Sitting at a table outside the boulangerie across from the Familia ou ma chambre n'est pas d\u00e9ja pr\u00e9te, sur la rue des Ecoles in the Latin Quarter. In France, everyone rushes in to get armloads of baguettes or just one at lunch time; in the display cases are a staggering array of pastries including implausible green sacks that claim a connection to figs. I may have to buy one and paint a watercolour of it. Flying in over Sark and Jersey and the Normandy coast this morning on the Air France red-eye, a landscape of patchwork little fields edged with hedgerows and lines of poplar trees, multi-coloured: brilliant yellow, yellow-green, deep green. Herds of dairy cattle. Little stone farm buildings. Church steeples. Iam very tired. Confusing airport. Beaucoup de confusion en trouvant le bureau des billets pour oui, pour 5 francs plus. No point arguing. Plus des confusions trouvant le ligne 10 mon pauvre frangais! Canadians are highly thought of here, thankfully, although my joual accent makes them wince. Coming in on the RER through the outskirts of Paris past miles of suburban development, tall, narrow white stucco townhouses covered with climbing rugosa roses sprawled everywhere, red, pink, white, yellow; irises, wild yellow something; everywhere abundant and green. Look! A little Pomeranian is going into the patisserie. Young men meet in the street and delicately kiss each other on both cheeks. Chic young Parisian women have long Norman noses and a brow like Marianne, and wear their hair in chignons and mouth in a moue. Ou puis-j'acheter un carnet? Un t\u00e9lecart? Tout le monde en Paris fume des cigarettes et boit du caf\u00e9. There does not appear to be a take-out coffee option. Someone walks by with a bouquet of salmon pink carnations in a wrapper of bright yellow paper. The colour here! The baguettes are not sold wrapped up, and certainly not bagged in plastic; they are handed over the counter with a sheet of paper round the middle where they are grasped. That is very haptic. And conducive to mindfulness. Here, people do not rush about not noticing. They sit down for coffee. They eat the bread while it is fresh. In the shop windows and sidewalk displays, the fruits and vegetables, charcuterie, poultry and cheese are arranged with precision into ramparts and pyramids. The small requirements of daily life are accorded care and attention to detail. 105 Sunday May 9. La Familia. Paris My room has a sunny little wrought iron balcony with pots of cedars and red geraniums and a table big enough for coffee and watercolour paints, and a view of a spire in the direction of Notre-Dame. Church bells are ringing. In the street below, ladies in jaunty broad-brimmed hats are going to Mass. Dinner last night in a smoky bistro with two somewhat jaundiced Canadian doctoral students at l'EHESS. Talk of the Kosovo war\u2014 the NATO bombing which is much on everyone's minds. Distances are smaller here: geographically, it is not far way. The ethnic cleansing is both spontaneous and organised [a hapax?] in their opinion \u2014 Milosevic is not going round the country cracking a whip. To be cruel comes easily to humans. I was disabused of my romantic ideas of being a doctoral student in Paris. It is very different from graduate school in Canada. Tuition is cheap, but administrative support and mentoring are minimal, and you can only take out two books at a time from the Bibliotheque Nationale! The classroom discussions are elegant, but lethal. I am made aware that I live in a sheltered workshop, academically. Walked home afterwards through the old quarter; the rest of Paris was rebuilt with large intersections to \"allow the police to chase people more easily,\" but the Latin Quarter still has narrow cobbled-stone streets. We stopped to admire the Cluny. Gargoyles! Crenellations. Chartres Monday morning 7:35, May 10, Hotel Jeanne de Beauce, Chartres As the train drew closer to Chartres, an old gentleman seated nearby made sure that I caught the first glimpse, from a great distance, of the towers shimmering in the mist on the high ridge | rising up from the Beauce plain. The cathedral itself appeared as the train approached the station, the intricate walls surrounded by the low stone buildings of the original medieval town. In the afternoon I walked around the winding streets of the old quarter and down alongside the slow-moving Eure river. It was beautiful, there were flowers everywhere, mock orange and ruby chestnut trees in bloom. Up close, the outside surface of the cathedral is old and pitted as if it were \u2014 it is! \u2014 wearing away. Weeds and grass and moss grow out of crevices in the steps and walls. The portals are more visually accessible than I would have thought from the photographs, the arches and tympani of the facade encrusted with animated 106 carvings of saints and sinners, artisans and demons, animals and vegetation, tools and books, everything in the Werold. Once inside the huge door of the Royal Portal, I made my way through the crowd of pilgrims in the narthex \u2014 May is a popular month for pilgrimage in France, yesterday was for invalids in wheelchairs and stretchers. Stepping out of the chattering street into the hushed atmosphere of the nave, my first impression was... Ohhh. ...how beautiful...of the vaulted interior towering unimaginably high overhead, stone pillars springing from the shadowy corners of the side-aisles and ambulatory into the brilliant clerestory far above. The details of the stained glass are imperceptible, but the blue is luminous, otherworldly. The floor is paving stone and sloped, to wash it down more easily when animals lived there, pilgrims slept over, and the marketplace was held in the nave! To come across the labyrinth is a SHOCK. So modest underfoot (and underchair), yet we know how powerful it is. Like the BVM, a quiet strength, elegant and unobtrusive. Walking around the side aisles: the height is astonishing ~ tall oblong spaces. All around the choir are chapels: La Sainte Chemise, La Sainte Famille, Saint Piat, the Ecumenical Chapel, the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Pili\u00e9re. Each distinct, each with a stand of flickering candles, kept replenished by visitors. A plaster statue of the Virgin has an air of patience. Perhaps not the image Clarissa Pinkola Estes was thinking of when, in an interview with the New York Times (Feb. 28, 1993), she said she saw Mary as \"a girl gang leader in Heaven.\" Afternoon. In retrospect. Lauren lectured today: \"Here we are! Who could have imagined? But it is so!\" \"Here\" is the Maison St. Yves, the 15 century diocesan seminary buildings transformed into a hostel and conference centre, down the hill and round the corner from the cathedral, on the rue St Eman.\" The classroom is large and bright, glass doors opening onto a walled and cobbled garden full of fragrant climbing roses and clematis that slopes down through woodland towards the Eure river at the far end, with broad worn stone steps up to the deep shaded porches of the old seminary building at the other. Large black urns trailing vines and bright geraniums screen sitting areas furnished with wrought iron tables and chairs. It is serene and quiet in the morning sunlight. Lecture One. Lauren advised us to do deep spiritual work rather than tourism or trying to learn everything right now. \"Stay Open\" is the theme of the week, \u00b0\u00b0 http://www.diocese-chartres.com/styves/index.htm 107 guided by the suggestion from Cousineau's book on pilgrimage: do what you love, rather than what you think you ought. We are fortunate to be free to do this: when she asks the Rector, \"why you don't walk the labyrinth here?\" he says, \"we are glad you are doing this in America, because we have too much history here, unhealed.\" -- what does he refer to? WWII? The Revolution? The separation of church and laique?*' I'm still on Swimme's Question: what kind of education system supports the experience of sacrality, cosmogenesis, the awareness of our origin? What is Truth? Lauren asked, then told Anthony de Mello's story of the Students and the Master: First student: \"The path is built on energy and effort; this is the Way of the law.\" The Master said, \"you're right.\" Second student: \"Effort is based on ego, the path is through surrender.\" The Master said, \"you're right.\" Third student: be right!\" The Master said, \"you're right!\" Who's right and who's wrong is not the point. The truth is, we each have a piece of the truth. Once we understand that, then we can hear each other. The Angels went to move the Mirror and it fell and broke into thousands of shards. We each pick up one shard \u2014\"it's the Truth!\" \u2014 but it's only part of the Truth. So when we are grasping, it is unhelpful. The Master was gracious to university dons who visited him, but he would never answer their questions or be drawn into their theological speculations, because, he said, \"Can one talk about the ocean to a frog in a well, or transcendence to those restricted by concepts?\" We need to push our concepts out broadly. We don't know where these concepts are limited, therefore we need to find the limits, gently. We will be doing that here at Chartres: the labyrinth is a clear container, with boundaries. You know when you're physically in it and out of it, therefore the inner world becomes transparent to you, wherever you are, including your frustrations and impatience. If you are disconnected between the mind, body, and spirit, you don't see this. What is going on in our own souls, the world's and the planet's souls? This dilemma of disconnection is the Soul of our time. *' Paula, the Canadian-in-Paris I met for dinner the first evening in Paris, mentioned this, on the subject of Christmas decorations at school \u2014 a tree is OK, a cr\u00e9che is not, parce que l'\u00e9cole est laique. 108 New forms of education address this, e.g. Jean Houston's work in multimodal forms of education that connect body movement and singing tones with twelve- step re-patterning in affirmations.\" We remember song and music more than words, because these are closer to the body. In multimodal education learning takes place in layers, not just by disposition of facts. This is a transformative sort of education, the core is to open the heart to compassion, to be able to reach out and hear where someone is coming from. We've educated ourselves in the \"Divine Intellect,\" with history, facts, tradition - in scientific proof of the world as against blind faith. But it's the end of the road for intellectual knowledge: images are not speaking through this channel anymore. \"Divine Will\" is at work when you force yourself to believe. We do this to those outside the church: \"Have faith, figure it out later.\" We're fine until our life comes into an unforeseen crisis. We do this to ourselves; we work against ourselves. \"If you just believe/are good enough, you will be able to...\" This is based on will. It is no longer helpful. Tradition is rich. But, we've cut it of f. The labyrinth is a place to meet the \"Divine Imagination.\" Follow what attracts you and draws your interest ... and do up your seatbelts, we're in for a wild ride! The Soul. Plato describes the Soul as a sea-goddess, covered in barnacles and seaweed because it has been ignored too long under the sea.\" The soul is \" A distilled description of multimodal education and its purposes can be found in \"Applying Social Artistry to Decentralized Governance for Human Development For The United Nations Development Programme,\" presented to the 5th Global Forum on Re- inventing Government: Innovation and Quality in Government of the2 1st Century; November, 2003, Mexico City, Mexico. Available June 16, 2006, from http://www.jeanhouston.org/lectures/un.htm} . *? Thus far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose origina! image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form. And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, disfigured by ten thousand ills. But ... we must look at her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know whether she has one shape only or many, or what her nature is. Plato's Republic (608c-612a), translated B. Jowett, 1982. 109 debased when it pursues what it mistakenly thinks is the source of happiness. rather than love for what is timeless. The soul knows when something is timeless (Hillman, 1996). Aristotle says the soul thinks in images, but not the same way as \"monkey mind,\" which deals in images from the outside in. Soul did not invent itself, it is a presence from the divine world, which is an eternal place. Soul holds the echoes of a primal intimacy that has no limit or barrier (O'Donohue). Consider the sense of re-incarnation or previous lives: this is expressed through the soul, as is the collective unconscious. What might be the collective unconscious about Mary? Look at the statue of the Black Madonna, with \"soft\" eyes, not \"hard\" eyes. People here pray and kiss the pillar. Do you have the courage to do that? We find ourselves thinking, \"What am I doing? What if people see me doing this?\" Kissing is an intimate act, and to kiss a picture or ikon seems odd to us: we are afraid of Devotion. Where is the soul of our time? The soul is invisible to us. We have trouble with the invisible because we are so dualistic \u2014 compared with Ireland, where the statues are moving! We feel restless and weary as if of a burden; because we can't see the invisible around us. Chartres cathedral is the invisible world made visible. Although society has lost the sense of soul, the individual has soul. The longing of the soul is expressed as a longing to contribute and move towards the divine. The longing to belong is the activity of the soul. The longing of the soul is the greatest force because it is universal in every man, woman, child, every living thing, including the growth of plants, though this was considered heresy until a few years ago. Imagination is connected to the Soul more than the Intellect and the Will. The imagination is pushed away because of superstition. In the Reformation conflict arose around the imagination, as well as against the control by priests. Even now, ina school board in Arizona, teachers are not allowed to use the term \"imagine.\" This was not the case in the Middle Ages; rather it was used to guide people, everything was considered symbolic then. The problem now concerns the individual imagination versus cultural images, the co-option by culture, the hegemonic use of images. including the Virgin's. Emerson says: \"No days so memorable as those that vibrated to some stroke of the imagination.\" Something speaks to you. Something resonates. Hildegard spoke of the wedding, the dance of inner and outer worlds. As indigenous people's use of the totem, so our use of the rosary; the candle is an 110 image for the movement from inner world to light the candle in the outer world, to start a new something in your life, to turn a page, or to forgive. Question from the group: What is Magical Thinking? Answer: The imagination can go awry. The developmental stage in the child that rises from the connection, \"I'm hungry, therefore Mom comes with food\" can become distorted into \"I cried, the folks fought, because I cried\" if the connection is falsely attributed. This distortion, \"I'm in charge,\" is called the \"grandiose self.\" If you work only in the imagination, there is no fraction in the world. When will it happen? This is an important confrontive event, for example, in the Jim Carrey movie \"Liar Liar,\" when the character was faced with the need to be honest. The Soul is not definable. It is the source of movement and light. It speaks in metaphor. Teresa of Avila described the Soul as a castle, and as flaming tongues. The Soul manifests the hidden, but that doesn't mean it's not there. Native Americans and non-industrial peoples understood the soul to be thin, insubstantial, a shadow. Soul originates in image, is conceived within the form of an image. The characteristics of receptive visualisation are the same as the state of illumination in creative people: \"sense of correctness, surprise, the answers to questions comes whole in shorthand... complicated concepts come in symbolic form\" (Samuels, 1975). Consciousness can be seen as a kaleidoscope. We had the pattern that we could see and measure and count. Now the kaleidoscope is shifting from the observer, but now the observer is part of the experience. Fritjof Capra says we call up the molecules to study and they're already there. The scientific and psychic face of the universe is shifting. This is a post-modernist age where physicists and mystics are talking. See Mindwalk, his brother's video, filmed at Mont St Michel. It's no mistake we came back to an ancient pattern. It's part of the paradigm shift. Characteristic of paradigm shifts is that something is given up that wasn't even questioned, part of the framework. We are giving up structure for process, and foundations for network. Jungian Marion Woodman, describing the soul, tells of a dream of going down into a basement. In the sub-basement, ina little box, is a sick little animal that turns into a baby. \"What are you doing here?\" the dreamer asked. \"You would have killed me,\" the baby replied, so it had abdicated to the invisible 111 world, like Glaucus under the sea. If we fail to nourish our soul, we lose our sense of perception, have no ears to hear music, no eyes to see art. The creative process shrivels in the absence of a dialogue with the soul. The soul is the still small voice that manifests in image, a sense of \"correctness,\" an auditory sound, something clicking into place. In the labyrinth, let the mind quiet because you are finding your natural pace. Let go of petty thoughts, including the petty thought, \"Ohmigod, I had a petty thought!\" Four categories of small groups are created, although over the course of the week we will all get round to all the areas: 1/ Healing: could be psycho-spiritual, could be forgiveness, of ourselves, of others, of God; could be seeking mercy for our hardness on ourselves. Something is hanging on to you, and you to it, this is the group for you. 2/ Soul Assignment: What am I doing here? We have resources, we have been given the time to question. Now how do I contribute my gifts? The kaleidoscope is changing, what's my next step? The title is from Kierkegaard: we come to earth with sealed orders. 3/ Initiatory Step: A new chapter, a new book. It's time to shed something 9in this way it is close to healing). If there is frustration, it may be shadow work. Recapturing ritual will help. 4/ Self-knowledge: stuck, not able to move. Struggling against the Shadow, but in there are hidden gifts. You may have to broaden the container of your minds. The end of Monday's lecture. Monday night late, sitting with the Sainte Chemise. Retrospect. I am walking in silence in a procession, two by two, into the cathedral by the north porch, a rising of the spirit, excitement?\u2014 fullness! \u2014 this is historical space, and momentous for us. The cathedral windows catch the last of the sunset streaming in from the west and gradually grow dark, tall candles illuminate the corners of the west nave, votive candles waver and glow around the perimeter of the labyrinth. The majestic heights and shadows of this place fill me with awe. Then springing tears as the singers start up: the music, Gregorian chant, sounds like the cathedral looks. But on the labyrinth itself, intermittent. Arrhythmia. 112 I was seeing us all walking in this ancient place where people have walked for hundreds of years \u2014 old, young - those people are long dead now. Someone invented \u2014 discovered? \u2014 this arrangement. Again I was struck by the pattern of walking in sequence: we pass each other at different points in the path and in our own and others lives. In the centre I stood in the sixth petal. I was wondering what I should do. I was thinking of the bad-tempered bird-selling artist outside, he seems as much in a conceptual cage as his birds. The oppressed reproduce their oppression. I felt deeply tired of it, of the oppression of artists, of the imagination, of ourselves. At the same time, there was a sense of being profoundly integrated internally \u2014 political, philosophical, passionate, the dimensions that matter, Freire's concept of praxis. Then I was troubled. Am I deluded? Lauren is not political in her analysis. But the idea of paying to learn access to the imagination is distressing, like telling people the air was gone and making them buy it back, which already happens with water. Then worried \u2014 well, how am I going to make a living? Then swamped, thinking about the divorce proceedings waiting back in Canada. At that point I had a mighty urge to leave the labyrinth. I wanted to get out. It was very crowded. I was annoyed at all the others for being there. My favourite part of the long outside run was full of people. I made my way slowly between them and the fire \u2014 the red votive candles arranged in each lunation. It was awkward. But I could have stayed forever waiting for it to clear. What to do? I pondered this as metaphor. Maybe I am supposed to walk between people and fire? Or is it just bad timing? Or is it that I have a really limited capacity for being in groups? It was an exhausting day, especially translating for the Americans at lunch. I was afraid they'd all get tripe (though it was delicious) and it would be all my fault. 113 Tuesday, May 11, 4 a.m. Wide-awake. Feeling resistant. That deep heavy tiredness came over me on the labyrinth. A significant place, a nexus of power lines. Maybe it's all much simpler than I think. Maybe I really am anti-social? Not a flock person. After breakfast. Retrospect. Reflecting on the labyrinth last night. This morning what stands out is walking carefully with the candles on my right, the northern side, past far too many people, disturbing them, endangering myself, generally annoyed and wanting to get out. That was weird and ambiguous. I did not like to disturb them, but as Rosenstiehl says, we are myopic. What else could I have done? Technically, I can't know that it's a long circuit. I could have looked up and checked for traffic. And what? Stayed at the labrys until they'd all passed? There were a lot of people. Mostly I wanted to escape. Fight or flight. Being in a crowd is upsetting. Especially on the labyrinth. Maybe there is too much vibe in a crowd? I love processions, but they are orderly. My mood has changed from elation at being filled with a sense of here-ness. Here am I, here are we at this mother of all labyrinths, in this mother of all cathedrals, walking on ancient paths, ancient stones. I am disturbed at disturbing people, but more disturbed at finding myself disturbed at all. So, either I control myself, and not inflict my disturbance on other people, or I stay away from groups. Feeling introverted, in retreat. My gregariousness is sometimes very superficial and transient, and it is the entertainer, the clown, the social face. But I enjoyed having company yesterday. I like my discussion group \u2014 two lady priests (one an old friend of Lauren's), a lay worker, a psychologist. I had fun at lunch (rillettes not tripe) and strolling around town with them: collectively we are Flock. I very much liked Robin \u2014 stories of her Buddhism, woeful rebellious daughter, frustrated artist state; we shopped and looked at toy stores. I am trying to be compassionate. We are all afraid of unmasking, no? So, at the centre of the labyrinth, thinking about the caged birds and their caged artist owner \u2014 the insight of the caged imagination \u2014 a motivation for what I do \u2014 but what am I doing? I love being at school, but not knowing where it's going is unnerving. The prospect of having to justify myself at court in the fall just fills me with despair. Surprised to read in Cuneen this morning about St. Jerome's friend Paula, the Roman matron who abandoned everything including infants, and took off for Judea to become a scholar. It was comforting to see this precedent, an unusual interpretation of women's actions. Synchronous book-medicine I sat with plaster Mary last night after the walk and ... cried some more. For my kids, for my own orphan-ness, for the hardness of life sometimes, the harshness of 114 divorce. But what if I'd stayed? I'd be sunk by now! Memory recalls an early discussion with D. the fundamentalist former brother-in-law when I described what art inspiration felt like, and he said it sounded like Satan at work. What an unhelpful thing to say to such a trusting disclosure! [what a fool to trust him] I have been abused for my artist-ness. That's the truth. Not alone there, unfortunately (Cameron, 1992, p. 73). I have doubts about this because maybe it's fabrication from straws. But they were big straws. I could be a monastic, only, it would be GrouchoMarxist, I can't imagine a group I'd want to be in. An ordo. Reading this morning about retreats and cloisters. Doris says we all lived together in a convent several lifetimes ago where I was the abbess, we made tinctures and eaux-de-vie to keep the community afloat, and I navigated around the bishops, with some amusement. If what Lauren says is true about past lives and the timelessness of the soul, then maybe I should look at that need to withdraw...(and wrangle with bishops). I have such unreliable perspective. I never know when my work is good \u2014 though I think I know when I'm chickening out. The soul in Phaedo, underwater covered with seaweed and barnacles: scraping off the barnacles can get pretty rough sometimes, takes off bits of the skin as well. Reminds me of Job scraping his sores with a potsherd. I also sat with the Black Madonna. She has twinkling iridescent stones in her crown; she and Jesus look omniscient. What does Mary know of me? My bottomless sorrow? What is the use of knowing the depths of sorrow? All year at school I have been sorting out origins and motives, identifying the tangles, clearing out the canal. In construction of identity I studied \"home\" dreams, fathers and mothers, exclusion, outsider-ness, antinomies of self/not self; home/not home; this being alone/in a crowd. I asked Her, \"What do you see when we all sit before you weeping?\" The labyrinth is a strange place: alone together, we have to suspend our aloneness in order to get round each other on the path. Struck once more by the individual choreography of passing. What a bulldozer I can be sometimes, how graceful other times, obliquely slipping through. Lecture Two. Lauren suggests we not unpack, but rather build the charge. She reminds us what a privilege it is to be walking in the same space as predecessors of centuries past, especially with the Gregorian chants, that the Old Mind, the deep imaginative part, needs ritual action. The purpose of ritual is to wake up the old mind, to put it to work through walking and prayer. The 115 \"old ones\" inside of us, the parts of the brain that are ignored - these parts do not speak in English, but in candlelight and colour and nature. The Notre-Dame cathedrals were built for the Mother of God: there are 176 images of Mary in Chartres cathedral. Why have we ignored Mary? Why are we re-discovering her now? This reflects the Soul of our times: we are seeking to reclaim the Feminine, the Goddess, the Mother of God, the sacred feminine. It is important to keep many levels in words. Celtic poet Kathleen Raine's line \"I came too late to the hills...\" refers to the inexhaustible, the hidden mountain of song, story, speech, spell. Chartres was settled in the late 1\u00b0 century C.E., before the Christian impulse shot into the world, leading to Celtic Christianity, although persecution of Christians continued up to the 3\"? century. Notre-Dame de Sous- Terre, the dark carved wooden figure of Virgo Paritura, the Virgin about to give birth, was a major symbol of that era, her cult well established when the Christians arrived in Carnute and discovered people who The Wilderness I came too fate to the hills: they were swept bare Winters before I was born of song and story, Of spell or speech with power of oracle or invocation, The great ash long dead by a roofless house, its branches rotten, The voice of the crows an inarticulate cry, And from the wells and springs the holy water ebbed away. A child I ran in the wind on a withered moor Crying out after those great presences who were not there, Long lost in the forgetfulness of the forgotten. Only the archaic forms themselves could tell! In sacred speech of hoodie on gray stone, or hawk in air, Of Eden where the lonely rowan bends over the dark pool. Yet I have glimpsed the bright mountain behind the mountain, Knowledge under the leaves, tasted the bitter berries red, Drunk water cold and clear from an inexhaustible hidden fountain. The Collected Poems of Kathleen Raine. Washington DC: Counterpoint Press (2001), p.132. were already worshipping a Mother of God, the Black Madonna. Christianity fit in the sense of fulfilling the prophecy of the Goddess having a divine Child. Characteristic of the Notre-Dame de Sous-Terre are her eyes closed, to look back into the past (\"I came too late to the hills\") and her Crown, not of fleur de lys but oak leaves, reference to Celtic sacred groves.\" There had been a According to Julius Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars (Bk VI, ch. 13-14), the Druids gathered once a year at the sacred center of the Carnutes in an oak grove with a well, where they settled legal disputes and religious questions. This same oak grove would become the future site of Chartres cathedral. \"Chartres 116 seven churches at Chartres, all devoted to Mary. Chartres was a Marian site. St. Hilary wrecked goddess sites: the sacred feminine desecrated, broken, torn apart. It was not allowed to portray Mary alone without a child: too close to an image of the Goddess. The kaleidoscope changed from mother god to father god. When Roman Christianity won out over Celtic Christianity, we lost our connection with nature. The Romans made everything linear, tossed out the circle which was a Celtic symbol of the divine. The change in the liturgical church can be seen in the words - especially referring to the Holy Spirit as HE! We need a broader metaphor for God - Mother, Mother/Father God. This affects how we respond to Divine Nature. If the words don't work, the heart won't open and we stay stuck in a negative space. So we look for other images. The \"Kingdom of God\" doesn't work for us, though it did for Medieval mind. The image of God as a circle would change our view of the Fallen, of hierarchy etc - we would all be equal! We are all looking from different views and we are all in there. God is infinite, God can be seen in an infinite number of ways, can be described and found everywhere, the way the circumference is everywhere, the centre nowhere (Evelyn Underhill) In our time, the sense of the collective unconscious knows what it needs, and rises up. The receptive has been put in Shadow through the hegemony of the aggressive masculine. Instrumental reason needs to be reintegrated with the receptive and holistic. Desecration of the well at Canute\" is significant for the archetypal and unconscious, because the well symbolizes the entry in the vertical axis, the axis mundi between heaven, earth, and the underworld. Similarly, in the Avalon myth, the Veil is thin where one is moving between worlds. Jung said the recognition of the Transfiguration of Mary in 1950 by the Roman Catholic Church was the greatest event of the century. The Vatican debates whether Mary is a co-creator! We recognise eternal feminine archetype in ourselves, others, images. What does ring true in the heart? Mary is a prism for this. (Recommended reading: Eisler, The Chalice and the Blade, Stone, When God was a Woman; Gautier, D. \"Maps of the Eternal,\" in Gnosis Magazine, #27) Archetypal symbols differ amongst cultures, so we need to be open. The labyrinth can be understood as the Western medicine wheel. Cathedral and its Stained Glass,\" Athena Review, Vol. 4, No. 2. 2005.

They understood world soul, god and creation. The cathedral reflects sacred laws of harmony, proportion, emanation, light, vibration, sound: the building is acoustically perfect for chant. designed to represent the celestial city the illumination from the windows expresses the belief in God as Light. Authors of theology-as-kaleidoscope focused on man in relationship to God. They expressed truths, the deepest wisdoms, in metaphor, myth, allegory and fable(fabu/a), especially Christ fables, understanding myth to be truth conveyed as metaphor; the invisible, the lived out microcosm of the divine macrocosm. Metaphor also conveyed the cosmological process of involution,\" the veils of matter intermittently revealed in the restoration of Anemnesis,\" the recollection of lost divinity which Plato refers to in the Phaedrus. The geometry of the cathedral makes manifest the divine order of the House of God. The Quadrivium was the curriculum to study this order: Astronomy, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and harmony, the linking of sacred numbers. Numbers, interval, ratio form the true foundation of music, the movements of the heavenly bodies. To study these leads the mind to the sacred source. Early, pre-Christian Celtic people knew how to walk through veils to invisible worlds, what O'Donohue means by \"the statues are moving\". We experience deep fatigue when we can't \"see\" invisible world - we grow tired of unchanging \"veils.\" Do our rituals capture and help us enter invisible world? Patriarchal rituals are orderly. Other paradigms of ritual, e.g. feminist, unchurched, make ritual up in the moment, and incorporate body movement, chanting, the multi-sensorial. Holding an old smooth stone in the hand, something ancient and familiar, allows us to let go of thinking mind. There is a whole other way of understanding ritual as a way to create something meaningful, using flowers, candles, rhythm, chant. \u00b0\u00b0 In integral thought, involution is the process by which the Divine manifests the cosmos. The process by which the creation rises to higher states and states of consciousness is the evolution. Involution prepares the universe for the Big Bang; evolution continues from that point forward. The term involution comes from the idea that the divine involves itself in creation. Teilhard de Chardin, Jean Gebser, Rupert Sheldrake, Francisco Varela, Ken Wilber and many others are associated with the development of this concept. \u00b07 Anemnesis or \"recollection\" is the process that allows human beings to remember the vision of the Forms their immortal souls glimpsed while traveling through the ideal realm during the process of transmigration which occurred after the death of the body, before reincarnation into another one, a theory derived from the teachings of Pythagoras. We are attracted to beauty, for example, because the beauty of phenomena reminds us of the pure beauty of those Forms. 118 The timeless and eternal meet in the reality of rhythm and re-occurrence\u2014personally verifying the truth of cycle, recurrence, rhythm. Jacob Needleman, Time and the Soul The veil drops away - or does the veil get thicker? Discern between mesmerizing and repeating something meaningful. If the meaning is gone then we reach for something new; we reinvent ourselves. This takes courage. But we only have this life once, consciously. Ask yourself, how does the veil fall away, for you? Einstein says, the significant problems we face cannot be solved with the same mind level that we created them. The labyrinth functions at both ancient and new levels, it is very useful installed in places where there is pain, transition, time on hands, an opportunity for perceiving at another level. The labyrinth is perfect for these situations. The School of Chartres knew this. The church has trouble recognising oracles e.g. the I Ching, it needs a bigger screen, needs to provide for Spirit to enter our lives. But with spiritual fervour, spirit rising, comes chaos, restlessness, a loss of pattern. With ideas that we can create our own rituals, we need to ask, how open is open? The labyrinth organises chaos. It has a strong enough structure, one can't manipulate the labyrinth, one can't set an agenda. But evil does exist. Chartres is slow therefore to open the labyrinth. Pere Legaux warns, \"Do not upset the stupid people.\" Question for the group: When is the last time/ first time you recognised the coming to consciousness? The end of Tuesday's lecture. Tuesday, retrospect. Pere Legaux, the Rector of the Cathedral [now Emeritus], visited with the class today. The astonishing thing was hearing him say that the Roman catholic church was wrong to define itself by exclusivity; the world needed the welcome to diversity of the Episcopalian church. He gave Lauren the key to the cathedral, which was against the law as the cathedral was now owned by the state\"; but as Louis XIV said, \"L'\u00e9tat, c'est moi.\" And in the cathedral, he, the Rector, was *8 Chartres cathedral was designated a World Heritage Site in 1979, having met Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention criteria (i) to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius; (ii) to exhibit an important interchange of human values, over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design; and (iv) to be an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history.

Lauren pretended to swallow the key, which was very large and old-looking. [Within a couple of years, Pere Legaux was made an Honorary Canon at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. He looked so much like Rev. Alan Jones, the Dean of Grace cathedral, that there was some talk of them having been separated at birth.] Wednesday morning 6:15, May 12\" I woke up with a vision of the narrow streets going up hill and round corners, through little passageways where the cathedral appears. It reminded me of the recurring dream I had as a child, of running through streets up a hill. The cathedral is up at the top of the hill. Maybe that's what I was searching for in the dreams. Exhaustion. I spend all my free time in the French dictionary, translating. It is exhausting. I talked to Lynn the facilitator. She cries every time she's alone on the labyrinth. The facilitators are the priestesses of the labyrinth. They are devoted. They know about devotion. The lecture yesterday was astonishing \u2014 how far is the limit to the labyrinth use? The example came up of a hospital board considering installation of a chapel with a labyrinth. Some scared person, worrying about voodoo practitioners sacrificing chickens in the centre, opposed the plan, so, no chapel. Lauren was reminded of some one reporting from Veriditas about a group of Satanists wanting to use the labyrinth! But they never showed up, so it was a non-issue. How far is too far? The spiritual urge invites chaos. Chaos is necessary. The labyrinth organises chaos. Robin talked about a situation at Easter at St. Mark's in Seattle. A disturbed Russian emigr\u00e9e flipped the bishop's mitre off his head, and then sat down on the altar. The vergers had tried to reason with her, but \"when her bum hit the altar,\" that provoked people, and they were violent about dragging her out. That upset even more people. So Robin was dealing with the aftermath of that. But I wouldn't want to see the bum on the altar either. What would Paddy do? Babies escape and run up to him when he's preaching, but that's not the same as mentally disturbed adults insulting bishops. I wondered about sacred space and time, then. How the Russian woman had ruptured the \"space\" that had been constructed. Sacred space and time are heterogenous, not homogeneous. She was a trickster, a rupture in the consecrated space. What to do? She wanted a reaction, perhaps even a violent one. The Americans. Dommage! Robin says at St. Mark's they pray for forgiveness for what is done in their name. It must be very strange . [Years later, shaking head in 120 sorrow and disbelief when Canada at Harper's insistence stumbles deeper into Afghanistan, and the bodies start coming home...] This is all about travelling, but what about my spiritual progress? I can't separate areas of my life. Work and spiritual and studies and family are all in global flux. Do I know too little or too much? I do notice how this year's work has changed my approach (I'enqu\u00e9te bas\u00e9e en art) and perception. How exactement?? It's the translations between words and objects.

Lecture Three. \"When you follow her you cannot take a wrong turning,\" said Bernard of Clairvaux of the BVM. In the Bible, the Path is referred to as woven invisibly. \"When you can't understand the invisible, in the visible is metaphor, which is a stepping stone to understanding the invisible.\" Hugh of St. Victor. Why are there no journal references in history to labyrinth practice? It may have been a secret rite, unmentioned intentionally. The secrets need to be revealed,\" suggests Jean Houston, because we need a new way to understand humanity. Only those who have ears can hear. This protects the secret: the work is ours to do, to understand, to open our ears. Feminine imagery at Chartres includes the rose, the lily, the rosette. The imagery speaks at many levels. To understand it represents a psychological shift into receptivity so that you receive the world in which you are walking, in contrast to the aggressive linear approach. The pattern of the labyrinth can be seen as entrails, recalling their convolution and ability to absorb. \" This comment brought to mind the Tibetan Buddhist terma tradition: \"A terma is a time-specific teaching, revealed only at the appropriate moment in history. Until then, it remains hidden, in a mountain, in a lake, in the sky, in the mind, guarded by the dakinis until the right person finds it and makes it known. Unlike the Bible, the Koran, or the Torah, texts that lay claim to ultimate truths for all time, termas are also context specific. Time activates the teachings, setting them off like chemical reactions when the moment is ripe, at the time when that specific teaching is needed, though it may have been hidden away centuries before. Termas continue to be found, freshening the stream of revelation and guidance.(Galland, 1998, p.167) 121 On the labyrinth we are icons for each other. Use a \"soft-eyed' approach, step out of judgement state. The Maze is the outer world of decision. The labyrinth is the inner world of decision. Your inner life becomes transparent to you. For example, why are you restless waiting at a corner in the labyrinth? What in your life is calling you? What is the summons between heartbeats? The pull from the soul is that part of us which remembers the dream, the grandeur of possibility. What work do you need to do? Let Mary reflect back to you. \"Virgin\" means self-contained, standing in her own fullness. Mary is the bridge to Muslim and Jewish traditions. She appears in many different capacities: as the Theotokos, Mary as the Mother of God; in the Enunciation: remember when your life got birthed? \"Fear not, the Lord is with you.\" In Bill Viola's Greeting video, Mary and Elizabeth embrace for 45 seconds; in the Pietra, Mary holds her dead son; in the Assumption: Mary is lifted to Heaven; as Queen of Heaven, she appears without a child, where she is usually depicted with, as in the Belle Verri\u00e9re window; the Seven Joys and Seven Sorrows of Mary, her suffering and intercession on our behalf. Move the images around in your psyche. Divine Imagination takes what it needs of the image for communing with your soul. When you go inward via the imagination, you are in liminal space. Trauma diminishes this space, according to D.W. Winnicott, and makes it unavailable. We are then at the mercy of our fears and projections. Fear takes us over like ink does water. Our sense of self - story - is constructed by others. We need to reflect, reconstruct, revise the story. The inability to reflect is a sign of immaturity. What's the story you've been told versus what's reality? Find out by stubbing your toes on what really went on here. Converse with yourself: what happened? What was actually happening? What we've bought into, who other people think we are feeds our fears. We suffer from inflation, a deluded idea of your size in terms of bigness and smallness. In psychotherapy, we fill the room with wood shavings, which we have to go through at the next appointment! We need a ritual for Letting Go. It's time to come home. Relevant shape is a spiral. You could tell yourself \"I could get in trouble here,\" and fall in, or you could pass it by and know to be healed. This isa GRACE point - let God in. Tonight on the walk is the release part of the work. There is a \"burning bowl\" in the crypt. What will you write down and burn? Up against the wall of change. \"determined to save the only life you can save - speak the words you must speak.\" 122 Richard Rohr OFM lists five things to which we must be reconciled if we are to live life fully: @ life is hard, do not waste time trying to avoid the legitimate pain of being human (a corollary is that suffering is the most efficient means to transformation, and God makes use of it as frequently as possible) \u00ae the certainty and reality of one's own death, loss and one's fear of loss \u00ae \"You are not that important!\" Cosmic and personal humility is central for truth and happiness in this world @ control is an illusion and may be surrendered by a deep experience of one's own powerlessness \u00ae your life is not about you, it is about God. You are part of something much bigger. \"God comes to us disguised as our life\" Richard Rohr. Where are we in that stream? Rohr's insight helps us put our lives in perspective, then we are not so frightened that we run away from it. Dying a good death means that life comes to completion. The people who are moved with you have been given some kind of gift. Buddhist monks train with death by meditating on decomposition and corpses, sitting with decay. We can never step into the same river twice. Capture this by finding a natural flow in the labyrinth that fits into our own natural timing, that lets us be open to the present moment. If we are closed off to the moment, there's no access, no way in for gifts. To open for a millisecond is a glimpse of the divine. \"Should I assign meaning in the labyrinth, or assume that it's the divine talking to me?\" Which voice do you listen to? Rhythm and re-occurrence are aids to identifying which one is the still small voice. Honour the longing that is met there! Inspiration from God can be a terrible thing. When God touches your life, there can be shadow that you didn't know about yourself. Life is turned upside down. It's not negative, but it's not fun either. This rarely gets as nutty, as in the \"Son of Sam\" case; but collectively? e.g. religious wars\u2014Kosovo. Why can't they see? Let crystals come up from the collective unconscious. Ignatius re \"discernment.\" It's a struggle between the good angel and the evil angel.

Karen Armstrong, author of The History of God and others, was a member of an English Carmelite convent, a strict, silent order. She was asked to leave convent due to being bulimic, anorexic.

The dualism between sacred and profane was not helpful. Wednesday's lecture ended with the story of the rabbi, the soldier, the gold behind the stove', and the advice that we seek what was hidden. The end of Wednesday's lecture. '\u00b0! Rabbi Eisik of Cracow had a dream. If he travelled to Prague and looked under the bridge, he would find a great treasure. The first time he had this dream, he ignored it. Rabbi Eisik was a practical man. He avoided extravagant gestures in order neither to be nor to appear foolish. But then he had the dream again. And again. And again. And so Rabbi Eisik donned his cloak and set off for Prague in search of gold. After a long and arduous journey, he finally arrived. He found the bridge easily, but it was guarded, day and night, by soldiers. He waited for his opening, one day, then two, but the changing of the guards was too efficient. Finally he gave up, cursing himself for his credulity. Just as he turned to leave, one of the soldiers said, \"Hey, Old man, you've been hanging around here for a long time. And now you're leaving? What am I missing?\" Rabbi Eisik sighed. \"I had a silly dream. I thought God was talking to me in my sleep. He told me to come here. All the way from Cracow. I shouldn't have listened.\" \"Silly man,\" the soldier replied. \"I had a dream like that once, a recurring dream. God told me to go to Cracow and look up a Rabbi Eisik. If 1 did I would find a great treasure buried behind his stove. Can you believe such a thing. I certainly didn't. [ am sorry for your trouble, but you, sir, are a fool.\" Rabbi Eisik tipped his cap to the soldier, returned to Cracow, and found a great treasure buried behind his own stove. 124 Wednesday evening, the crypt of the cathedral. Deep underground, in a little chapel on the north side. Sunset. The slanting rays of light coming in through the low arched windows reminds me of the vision I had of the cone of white light illuminating a similar underground stone room, that opened out and carried me up through the ceiling of the crypt, releasing me into the cathedral above, collapsed on the stone floor surrounded by saints and comrades standing over me in a circle holding torches! I understand the light better now. Tam sitting in an underground room with a pattern painted all over the walls. I don't know what these =\u2014R mean. f . a Red lines, black crosses. yw It was painted in the twelfth century. ', I am sitting in an underground room, SN built and painted in the twelfth century, writing in my journal. Iam trying to believe this. What voice to listen to? Today, I climbed the North Tower, and saw far away to Beauce: Today in the tower I met gargoyles. I have always loved gargoyles and chimerae, from the moment I first saw them in books. J found these three little dragon beasts all with their heads and tails still on after all these years, beautifully carved. I can't imagine how that was done because the cross section was deeply undercut like this: LO on 125 As I looked at them, I was flooded with memories of the times I have loved carved stone animals since I first saw pictures and learned the name Viollet-le-duc. I recalled all the animals like that I had drawn and carved myself, then the vision of the pillars in the underground room and the creatures at the base of the pillars frozen into stone and wanting to speak. I wondered what they wanted to say in that vision, and whether I'd heard them yet. It was a roomful of them, and the one I addressed seemed to speak for them all, which makes me wonder about whether indeed this is a larger purpose? All of us artists frozen, caged? Today in our group we talked of mis-education and the misinformation we'd had to work through in order to recover our true selves. Veils of lies, the architecture of deceit. I am afraid of inflation. I started to cry (again). I felt as if I'd found my lost ...what? Brother? (I have indeed lost my brother. Actually, he lost himself.) Beloved? I miss making those creatures, remembering how it felt to carve them, reminded by the chisel marks on the stone of the feel of tool on surface, and form emerging from block. How I missed that, how sad I was when I packed up the studio. So I cried, and drew them, and cried (some more), and wondered what they had to say, and how great it was that it seemed like a good idea to the 12\" century 126 stonemasons to carve stuff like that all over the steeple. Such diversity. [actually 16 century'\"] 2 mm. Then I found the last one \u2014 the first two were sinewy lizard guys, but the last one! A cockatrice? Eagle-ish with snake tails and wonderful wings and a bulgy eye, half his face gone to pollution -- but he spoke to me of multiple origins and identity, and I remembered what Geraldine had said: \"You are a translator between realms and modes via colours and textures and codes of all kinds.\" From that I understood that Iam chimaeric and not like the others. And that I need to see that this is a gift, not a monstrosity. These are not things to conceal \u2014 or feel ashamed about. Shame. Talking with my group. All telling our stories of getting past those wrong things we'd been told. Our mothers' narcissisms, the phoney histories and facades. The scapegoat's story, the outsider's. \"What an opera,\" they said (tough without the libretto! I thought), \"You were Cinderella!\" I told about the healing by my children, the promise to tell them the truth, the ways I have found to redeem it. learning to sniff out crap and conspiracy. (It was a conspiracy!) I hadn't trusted my body's truths. Poor body, trying all that time to get through, I'm amazed it didn't give up. So that was good. I said, \"Thank you for listening, I don't tell that story much.\" No wonder. Shadow is ... unloveable. So, now I want to see this as the gold in the chimney. What must I let go of? We talked a lot about that: \"If I become a minister will I be good enough? Ministers are good.\" \"Women shouldn't be ministers.\" Damned if you do, damned if you don't, that was Lee's story. Same here. Damned if I stayed, damned if I left. Damned both ways. So, what do I want to let go of? I wonder about the River of Sorrow' \u2014 the nature of the huge divide, the rupture. Being profoundly divided against myself. The image of the deep mucky clogged river appears. It was illuminating this year to see where it leaks into, especially the conflation of father [in wheelchair]-as-academic-Massif-Central.'\" I was glad to sort it out, even though I may never get over it, in the sense that it will 127 always be at work at some level, although Lauren talks about walking past it, healing. So what do I want to let go of? What am I sick to death of? The fear, the cycle of inflation and then crash. I would like to be more even tempered, say fewer things I regret.

Minor work performed on the cathedral afterwards included additions to the north tower, with a third section added during the second half of the 13th century. In 1507, master mason Jean Textier, known as Jean de Beauce, added a late Gothic flamboyant spire to the tower, replacing a wooden version destroyed in the fire of July 26, 1505. \"Chartres Cathedral and its Stained Glass.\" '\u00b03 An intuitive image of grief as universal, with a high dry place in the middle all the flooding, an island of consciousness of the possibility of joy, for respite.

In that stillness he was omniscient: he knew everything there was to know. To his credit, I remember him saying frequently, \"An educated person does not know everything, but he knows where to look,\" and he did. All the main floor rooms were lined with books, walls of books up to the ceiling, cliff faces made of books, canyons of books: he knew where they all were, and what was in them. We scrambled up ladders to find the books that he wanted, his voice guiding us from around the corner, out of sight. That was the remarkable thing to me, the Olympian quality of his knowledge: he could \"see\" round corners, he did not need his body to know what was worth knowing. Knowledge worth knowing, \"objective\" knowledge, was printed and resided in books on shelves: mountains of knowledge, accrued, accumulated, sedimented, piled up and added to by generations of people like my father at the University with book-walls of their own and their names on the front even of some of these books. Walls, and canyons and mountain ranges of books, lifetimes of books, and to know what was in them, you had to sit still and turn all the pages one by one. If you could not do that, you were undisciplined, uneducated, wilfully ignorant, deliberately irrational, tragically limited. The information I was receiving through my body was un-nameable, ephemeral, and puny in comparison, indefensible. How would I ever have knowledge worth knowing? I could not sit still! \"Sense of Place and the Construction of Reality: An Inquiry\" (1999) 128 I want to move into kind compassion. So, I have to let go of the self-flagellating habit. Live in the furry warm animal life. All around me are good things: health, happy children, wonderful friends, great teachers \u2014 scholarships! I have been blessed with great reserves of strength. Just commit myself and it comes to pass. I want to let go of anxiety, fear, and guilt. I could use some help with that. Much later, Wednesday night. How beautiful. We gathered in the Catechumens' chapel beside Notre-Dame Sous-Terre. Lauren led us through a meditation on releasing. The prayer was based on Luke, addressed to the Child: the water has run out of the pasture into the stream going to the ocean. Come quickly and follow it before your home turns into a desert. The crypt ambulatory at Chartres Cathedral After sitting in the ancient chapel writing for a long time, I walked out into the ambulatory of the crypt. It was dark except for hundreds of red votive candles lining the curved passageway and the stairs at the west end into the nave. I sat watching the firelight flicker and people slowly moving up the aisle, just shadows and silhouettes. Finally the sound of chanting drew me towards the stairs. By the huge baptismal font at the centre of the crypt ambulatory sat the facilitator with the 129 pre-Raphaelite face, looking serene in the light of many tall pillar candles. Beside her on the table was a large copper basin containing the blackened remains of crumpled balls of paper, the lists each of us had written and then offered up to the fire. A copper bowl full of fragile carbon black shells. At the top of the stairs the cathedral glowed with candlelight. There were bouquets of flowers everywhere, and we each received a single red rose as we came up from the crypt and walked into the narthex. The Catherine Blatsky Quartet was singing Gregorian chant-jazz fusion. I took off my shoes and walked barefoot into the labyrinth. I could feel the unevenness under my feet, noticing the small paving stones and the big millstones at the turns. I felt light and relieved and very calm. I straightened my back and I did not cry. It was much less crowded by the time I got to the centre, and I sat for a long time in the 4\" petal facing East towards the altar, thinking about my unhappy family of origin. I understood what a gift it was to have had the kids; telling our story to the group we saw how they were healers to me. The group had witnessed how the hurt of the self-portrait shaming episode had transmuted into a motive for my teaching practice.'\" When I came back out of the labyrinth, the atmosphere was full of the sounds of chanting, the smell of beeswax and roses, the sweet softness of a spring night. I walked around the cathedral, stopping where I thought were the intersections of the verticals and horizontals of the octagons, squares, and dodecaids, stroking the stone pillars, sensing the energy of the geometry activated by our walking and singing. At the crossing of the nave and the transepts, I lay down on the cold stone floor and looked up at the arches disappearing into the blackness far overhead. The feeling of being a child in the arms of her mother was quite clear. Finally I was ready to leave. Beside the small heavy wooden door set into the massive North Portal, the pre-Raphaelite facilitator stood in the shadows holding a tall candle to light our way out into the night. >] painted a self portrait in oils when I was eleven. It was sulphur green and black, really garish and awful, but I took it downstairs anyway to show my step-mother. She just stared at me and said, \"You are so self- centred!\" Years later I told my children this story. They were outraged: \"How mean!\" We thought of other things she could have said: \"Hn. Oil-painting is hard, looks like you could use some lessons,\" or \"Lots of famous artists have painted self-portraits, you could look at Picasso or Rembrandt or Van Gogh for ideas,\" or even \"I am trying to get the dinner on the table! Can you show me later, when J can look at it properly?\" Now | teach people to find the courage to support their vision. But I never did paint another self-portrait. \"Sense of Place and the Construction of Reality: An Inquiry\" (1999) 130 Thursday May 13\", Ascension Day Good morning. Perhaps it will be sunny today. Up until 1 last night, making the Virgin watching over my kids ina cathedral town. Even this morning I like it. I am feeling calm and happy. It's Ascension Day \u2014 very quiet at the station. I wonder if we have any Marian practice in Anglican? The Queen of Heaven. After the walk last night, I lita candle to the Virgin on behalf of the congregation back home and carried it around the ambulatory. Then I sat in the chapel of Notre- Dame de la Piliere and visited with Her. I thought, \"we both have sons, no?\" She is an example for me. I had deep resolution about my children, I understood what a gift they were, how being authentic with them, the requirement for me to be authentic with them, to fulfill my solemn vows, had been deeply healing, though it did not always seem so at the time. I understood how much of my anxiety is around them, remembering at Grace Cathedral that the sorrow had arisen over them; at the anointing with oil service I had prepared a little pr\u00e9cis for the request to the priest but what came out was, \"I miss my kids.\" The priest had collected it all up and said, \"Jesus is walking with you and your kids.\" Last night I understood that Our Lady is watching over them, Our Lady and her Son, just like the priest said. So that was deeply comforting; the collage reflects this. The BVM and the kids The kids are sitting in a row, laughing and wiggling, and behind them the Virgin (Notre-Dame-de-La-Belle-Verri\u00e9re, from the south choir) has a knowing smile, like they were her kids too. In front of the children (all of them), there's a row of 131 cathedral walls and spires \u2014 they are inside the grounds of the cloister, safe and protected. Behind Nick and Selena's heads, a row of \u2014 what do you call them? \u2014 the arches over doorways; behind Aretha, the vaulted roof of the nave. Yesterday Hector said, \"Cinderella! In an opera! Of course you'd want to climb up into a tower, and never come back down.\" The insight was helpful. I told about the shoemaker at the corner (a shoemaker! A character out of Grimm's Fairy Tales) who said, \"Your mother is a bad woman. What she did was terrible.\" Hector said, \"How could you defend her? What were you defending?\" I thought, \"Oh! What would I defend? Her person? Her action? Her dilemma?\" How mortifying for a sensitive little girl! No wonder she wants to run away and hide in the arms of angels and not crowds of people. No wonder I have such ambivalence about extrinsic purpose and affirmation. So, Lauren asks, what voice are we listening to? What wrong definitions placed on us are we trying to grow out of? What do we need to leave behind in order to go into a new chapter of our lives? Last night I said goodbye to Fear, Anxiety, and Guilt and set them on fire in the Crypt and burned them up. They were in my way. Fear of unmasking, of being wrong, of being not good enough. Fearful architecture of deception, no? They lied to me, I said to the group, and everyone knew but me! It was most satisfying to tell the story and hear them say \"Ohhh! That's horrible!\" It is a terrible thing to manipulate someone's world like that. This would create the conditions for anxiety, no? (Miller, 1994).'\u00b0\u00b0 We talked about the \"exquisite\" subtlety (Hector's words) with which we all received mixed messages. The controlling. The guilting: \"You don't listen!\" \"I do listen,\" I said, \"I just don't agree.\" Wrong answer. (I thought to myself, \"You say terrible things. Why should I believe you have my best interests at heart?\") What did they want? To control, to cover up, to have their construction of reality unchallenged. But it was deceitful. I hate that! Though, after hearing everyone's stories yesterday of how parents' versions of events were so at odds with what the children recalled, I wondered about what the parents had to do to maintain their construction. We shared the view that our parents came from a generation that \u00a9 Swiss psychoanalyst Alice Miller locates the origins of the \"false self' and the binary of grandiosity and depression in the unconscious transmission of destructive patterns of abuse from generation to generation. Bringing the body's knowledge of trauma to consciousness and expression is the means to resolve this cycle: \"The body never lies,\" although it is usually ignored, with grievous results manifested in personal health and, in its extreme form (her examples are Stalin and Hitler), the brutal suppressions of dictatorship and violence of war. What survivors of parental cruelty need most is someone who shares their feelings of indignation, the \"enlightened witness,\" which Lauren Artress, in her wisdom, had arranged as part of the Chartres program. 132 seemed to have had some difficulty with insight and self-examination. Considering what we could piece together of their origins, it was no wonder. I began to see the road to compassion. Where is Mary in all of this? She's a wellspring, a source of refreshment, a stage of cleansing tears. Schedule: Thursday 5 pm, Pere Legaux, South Portal, Mary iconography tour, crucifix blessing Friday 9:30 closing, in the garden; 2-2:30 pm, tour and geometry lesson with Robert Ferr\u00e9, South Portal Lecture Four. We are creating anew. Mary is the \"microchip\", the portal, the one way that the Feminine Divine has stayed alive versus linear reductionist Romanizing Christianity, characterised by sin/Fall \u2014 O'Donohue calls it \"brutalizing.\" Invaders from the north ruined matriarchal cultures 2000 years ago. Mary has held the opening for the sacred feminine. Now, the kaleidoscope is changing. The binary exists now of the Flowering of the human spirit versus reductionism to sin. There was Original Blessing before the (Augustine) concept of Original Sin. Are we an evil people? We are longing to be fruitful. Do we know what it is to live with the Risen Christ? Look at the Collects for Easter'\" which emphasize deliverance from sin. We need a tradition that upholds our strength because we are not a strong people. The closed eyes of Notre-Dame Sous-Terre reminds us of \"Erde\" in the Ring Cycle of Wagner, the Earth waking up and singing to Wotan. Last evening's ritual relived the experience of going through the Womb of the crypt and awakening to a new light. We need the courage of myrrh-bearing Mary going to the tomb. We expressed our Fear of death on the burn paper. It was a Resurrection experience. The leader of the Catherine Blatsky Ensemble from Paris looked like Quan Yin, the Chinese Goddess of Compassion '*? Almighty God, who through your only-begotten Son Jesus Christ overcame death and opened to us the gate of everlasting life: Grant that we, who celebrate with joy the day of the Lord's resurrection, may be raised from the death of sin by your life-giving Spirit; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen. Collect for Easter Day. Collects: Contemporary. The (Online) Book of Common Prayer. The ECUSA (1979) Retrieved June 16, 2006, from http://www.bcponline.org/ ; http://anglicansonline.org/. 133 Your body learns it first, via the labyrinth, what it is to approach Mary (remember, nothing so annoying as a newborn saint!). The qualities associated with Mary are compassion, being gentle, gracious, grateful, and open. Mary is abiding and patient, loving, receiving, allowing flows and bursts. These are qualities of the active receptive. Avenues for the divine feminine needs inclusive language, rather than being \"grandfathered\" into the patriarchy. e.g. The Holy Spirit is SHE! Amazing Grace (Kathleen Norris) is a good resource for new thinking about language. Andrew Harvey says the sins and devastations we are inflicting upon the world are based in old paradigm understanding \u2014 might is right, fortress. We need to be embraced by the heart of the feminine divine, to forgive ourselves. Actions you can take include saying Rev. Alan Jones' prayer: \"Strengthen the heart of my friends, and soften the heart of my enemies.\" Every morning, a candle to Mary. In the world, support your clergy in the shifting of consciousness (People tend to not say anything if they like it). We are praying not only for ourselves, but for the ailing world and its pain. Consider the meaning of the word \" virgin\": it does not necessarily refer to sexual experience, but rather, a person unto herself. Magdalene has been much maligned on that account. See for example, sacred prostitutes, virgin deities. Caution re Wisdom: Going home, you will likely meet a lack of understanding. As at Whitby, the Roman way chosen over the Celtic. But the Romans would have imposed it anyway. BEWARE! But also, take comfort, you are more likely to be in touch with a deeper cosmic consciousness. The Labyrinth is a grassroots movement. More Dark Side. We are dealing with powerful Shadow forces of the Unconscious e.g. Kosovo. Hearing the generals speaking, Lauren's mind feels parched. Madeleine Albright is an example of an animus-ridden woman. We need this divine feminine and its power, it changes something in the human psyche. Seeing women priests drops a seed in because it shatters unconscious assumptions. Mary has another side to her image, not just gentle, but also powerful: the splitting apart in birth. Kali, the Hindu goddess of transformation can be destructive. In the I Ching, the \"Biting Through\" hexagram: when you are up against an issue, you need wisdom, not the animus of a woman who is locked into power of frozen psyche. We make the mistake of understanding power only ina masculine way. The masculine as it has evolved is characterized by fear and control. The feminine knows you can't control birthing, therefore you allow creativity. 134 After bringing the labyrinth to Grace and using it for a few months, Lauren said to Alan Jones: \"we've got a problem: this thing works.\" A long discussion ensued about pentacles, pentagrams, Sacred Diagrams. They concluded that the labyrinth was benign in its intention, due to its origin at the Notre-Dame site. The centre was powerful last night. The Heart chakra opens on labyrinth, after preparation in the crypt, in energy terms. To be contained in fullness in our own lives is self containment. \"I am the One who remains standing when I die.\" (O'Donohue) Pay attention! As in Paolo Coelho's story, \"The way of the Tiger.\" \"How do I inherit eternal life?\" There are vibrating patterns between stars, trees, insects, connects, constantly in motion. How to recognise the patterns? That is the greatest question. We can learn from experience to feel the pattern in the bones and blood. We each have to find our own, it cannot be transmitted. Pray for guidance, help to grasp the pattern. Few listen to voice of the spirit. Apply the pattern as in your own self. Behaviour that deviates is not within the pattern. If works out, it follows the pattern. Remember, \"If you follow Her, you cannot go wrong.\" If you want to know Mary, ask her to reveal herself to you. Here is a good place to start: Chartres was a sacred grove. Listen to songs of the earth: the natural world and the spirit world are connected through these. Hear / see / feel (walk!): the pattern is everywhere. Virginity is wholeness and completeness unto oneself. How do we birth our creativity? Commit the energy, time and resources to do so. Consider Hildegard von Bingen (the Germans have made her a saint, but the Roman Catholic Church has not!) At age 42, she became very ill, God was trying to birth something. She '\u00b0 A man was walking through the forest when he saw a crippled fox. \"How does she feed herself?\" he wondered. At that moment, a tiger approached with an animal in its jaws. It satisfied its hunger and left what remained for the fox. \"If God helps the fox then he will help me too\", he thought. He returned to his house, locked the door and waited for Heaven to send him food. Nothing happened. When he was getting too weak to go out and work, an angel appeared. \"Why did you decide to imitate the lame fox?\" asked the angel. \"Get up, take your tools and follow the way of the tiger!\" heard a Voice saying, \"Write what you hear and speak.\" Hildegard pushed through, writing and painting, composing music. We are there, scared of what's in us. The Gospel of Thomas, a Gnostic text, says, \"that which is within you that you put out into the world will save you. That which you do not put out into the world will kill you.\" Could it be that men go to war to connect to the feminine by letting blood? Could it be that males give birth by art-making? Lots of dynamics going on under a mile-thick surface. If you are on fire with something, people will stay out of your way. Your mess is your message Our Romance languages require a subject and verb. How can we use that clumsy language to talk about an invisible world? You don't have to know where we're going; that's a linear way to think. An artist spent three years getting to know the Himalayas well enough to paint them. He painted a mountain scene with a path. A patron asked, \"Where does the path go?\" Artist: \"Let me see.\" He disappeared into the painting and never came back. God is hard to recognise as She has disappeared into us.

God created the world through number and proportion, numbers are the archetype God used to create the physical world .. discovering these numbers and proportions is a sacred event. We learn these principles and can create as God did. This was the foundation of temple geometry. After the Revolution, Chartres cathedral was known as the Temple of Reason, on account of the sculptures of Pythagoras and the Seven Liberal Arts. The Equinox is the image most often pictured, after Mary (176) and Jesus (00). Ferr\u00e9 spoke at length on the subjects of geometry, architecture, and magic number squares, mentioned elsewhere in this account, and covered thoroughly at the websites of Ferr\u00e9, Critchlow, James and other investigators. Vendredi 14 mai, La Reine Saba, Chartres This morning we had the goodbye meeting and Eucharist. Big bread, hard to break apart, chewy solid French bread, French wine, in the secret garden at the seminary. Graffiti on the walls: AME, NOES a reference to Noetic? Kissing everybody goodbye in the passing of the Peace. Goodbye to Flock. A beautiful prayer by Kate the minister, about the four directions: North, to let thaw that which is frozen; East, that which is to be born; South, that which needs 1\u00b0 American philosopher (1852-1919), born and educated in Germany, who referred to himself as \"an atheist who loved God.\" 137 heat and passion; West, that which is dying away - if it is death, your body is no longer big enough to hold the spirit. I prayed to the East, that which is coming to be; to walk gently in this path. Lauren spoke of inflaming the divine imagination; the program was planned to fill our minds with images that could recur, every time we lit a candle, see a window, do up our seatbelts. We were to bring something to the altar to bless along with the bread and wine \u2014 what to bring? My picture of the Belle Verriere + the kids. Lee said it made her cry \u2014 me too. Now it's an icon. I will make colour Xeroxes and mount them and send one to Selena with a letter about how having her for a daughter has brought healing. Samedi 15 mai This morning I woke up thinking maybe I was wrong about political theory. Maybe to do that kind of analysis is wrong-headed and not what the Queen of Heaven would want? On the other hand if we do not see and know this, we are not wise as serpents, just gentle as doves. I think this is the big alternation in thinking process; it's Ignacian, to go back and forth. Doubt is permitted. OK, the pens\u00e9e about this is: I am worried -- no, concerned \u2014 that if I continue to study political aspects of Exile of the Imagination, I will continue to see in dualities and pass judgements and provoke the \"stupid people\" and set up confrontation and bash my head. On the other hand, if I don't, I will be incomplete in my spiritual growth because \u2014 what do I do with all this resistance? It rumbles along underneath the surface; it is part of my body's history. What can I look at to judge this? On peut dire que... Lauren's is one path and she is widely spreading a message. However, I get very unnerved by Republican Buddhists, for example. I remember my not-Conservative Buddhist friends talking about the shock of this. They refuse to get involved in the politics of it. And so does the phenomenology professor, she does not even want to hear about it. Perhaps I have to work through this. I can't dismiss either side. Ride the duality, and eventually it will come together. So I have ridden the duality, which I see in terms of reason and receptivity, or reason and intuition, or academics and the spiritual, or intellectual and artistic; and I am still struggling with it. 1 wonder\u2014if I am seeing polarities, does that cause them to endure? By setting up confrontation? But, it occurs to me, the ethics of geometry: if we are out of whack, then that's one way to name the out-of-whackness, no? If you think of math as a naming, as well as language - maybe they're all languages: math, colours, words; frames of reference. Geometry is a frame of reference. Political systems \u2014 I am thinking of Margot Grallert (1992) \u2014 the use of colour on ground, requiring 138 therefore the perception that text is not the only thing. The \"margin\" is not the background. All of us in the margins...and what's at the centre therefore? I don't know. I need to go and sit with Our Lady and ask about this. I am thinking to light a candle for myself and one for Mary Anne and Nancy and all of us women writing political/art material. I am wondering about cubism, the multi-perspectival, and the power of the avant-garde. The obligation of the avant-garde? I get so nervous about systematizing any of this \u2014- as soon as you do, it becomes rigid. But that's the point of the avant-garde, no? My Continental philosophy teacher says, \"Resist from somewhere, not only in reaction fo something.\" Oh. I am so ready to go back to work, but there is more and more. Dimanche, 16 mai We had coffee and strawberry tarts at the boulangerie Edelweiss, because the dining room at the Jehan de Beauce was full. The boulangiere gave us a special bag of Sacred Buns because it is the practice of that chain of bakeries, today being the third Sunday in May and therefore throughout France, la F\u00e9te des Pains, \"Le jour le plus croustillant de l'ann\u00e9e\"!\"\u00b0 Afterwards I went to kiss the Cathedral goodbye and sit with the Queen of Heaven and her little boy. Lit candles for certain individuals and was surprised by some very clear images of messages for each them that were to be written down and deliver personally, which I did. Next was a candle and an image of all my teachers, glowing with white light! And the message to be appreciative of them and their devotion and learning. Finally, I lit a candle for myself and all academic women, and asked about my path. What appeared was the Annunciation of Duccio (or Fra Angelico? or Jan Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece? Robert Campin? A survey vision) with Herself reading a book, and the message that for some of us, our path is to study and learn and write, one must continue to ride the several horses and to do what was necessary for that. It was quite clear! So, I should find a picture or an icon with that image. At the end...a mass was in session, the sung call and response (ora pro nobis peccatoribus nunc et in hora mortis nostris) floating up through the cathedral \u2014 I kissed the pillar and bumped my head on it like a horse and said Thanks. Then we \"1\u00b0 More images of this wonderful celebration at http://www. flickr.com/photos/chaville/sets/72057594094269889/. Accessed 16/06/2006 139 left Chartres and headed north on the Autoroute, to La Merveille, I' Abbaye de Mont St. Michel. Travelling Red poppies in the fields, les coquelicots. Trying to understand French road signs \u2014 they indicate This and Not-This; when you leave a village, instead of saying \"You are now leaving X,\" there's a sign of the name crossed out with a red line: Not X. The roundabouts are pretty odd too\u2014 the colours of the signs mean something, and there's more X and not-X sort of thinking, visually. You can see how semiotics arose in French thought, sign and signified, binaries of meaning. I bought the Monde Diplomatique for the Chomsky article on the NATO bombings, but he writes an idiomatic French with dropped verbs and I'm not catching the subtleties\u2014 some I know I'm missing, most not. By now I am having French thoughts, although my English is getting quite fractured. It's all fractured. I have been ordering bifteck sanglant and getting very strange looks, so I tried sanguinaire, but that was no better. I thought I was ordering steak cooked rare (saignant), but it turns out I was demanding that it be \"bloody\" or \"bloodthirsty,\" sometimes even insisting that it be \"wild boar\" (sanglier). Candide's excellent adventure. The French people we have met prefer not to hear their beautiful language mangled and so they take the time to correct us, persisting until we get it right, or at least better. Mieux. Mont St Michel. The single street leading from the ancient gate up to the fortress abbey is crowded with tourists and pilgrim groups, open air food stands and vendors of every possible sort of trinket and memorabilia, with Santana's \"Europa,\" a hit this summer, filling the air. At the highest point of the island is the Abbey itself, layer upon layer of building. From the ramparts you can see for miles, the tidal flats and les pries sal\u00e9es, with sheep and fat cows grazing. Golden St. Michel stands on the highest point at the tip of the steeple, overcoming les t\u00e9n\u00e9bres et du mal. The pelerinage pamphlet recommends consulting St Michel to advise one on the right path au conduit au Dieu. In the lower town, outside the parish church of St Pierre, is a beautiful statue of Jeanne d'Arc wearing a splendid breastplate. The brave defence of Mont St Michel against English attack during the Hundred Years War is said to have been a major inspiration for the Maid of Orl\u00e9ans. Here she looks magnificent \u2014 Xena Warrior Princess! I remind myself that we are not far from the places where the real Joan of Arc's life unfolded in actual historical events, fabulous though they may seem to nordamericanos.'\"' In the gallery I buy a little gold bee pin, une abeille\u2014 ''! According to the tourist brochures La Merveille, having never been captured by the English, is \"fundamental to the national soul.\" Perhaps the psychology of North Americans is missing that layer of cultural sediment that so informs the French sense of \"habitus\" towards social structures as varied (yet quotidien) as baguette shops and street corners. 140 c'est moi, qui travaille tout le temps'\"\u2014although the connection between the bee and the Archangel is not clear: perhaps it is their communicator-psychopomp identities. ''' More likely the bee is connected to the Benedictines whose motto is laborare est orare and whose Abbey this was, before it was turned into a prison after the Revolution, restored in 1874, and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. We drive away from Mont St. Michel, which disappears in the distance like a dream, and go by winding back roads and rolling countryside through St. L6 to Bayeux. The main street by the cathedral is lined with banners of all our flags! Signs in the windows say \"Welcome to our Liberators.\" Within living memory here, those battles and narrow escapes. Les pontons: the mulberry harbours at Juno Beach Normandy It is powerful: Normandy remembers its long history. People ask us politely what we are here for. The response we encounter as Canadians is striking, when we say we are going to visit the D-Day beaches and the battlefields of Normandy where our fathers landed and fought. Every day that we live in freedom is a debt to those men and here, in France, this is a visceral reality. They invariably shake our hands and thank us! Ina way I am sorry to cause them a resurgence of what must be dreadful memories. On the other hand, this is living history for them, within their lifetimes, and we need to 12 And in solidarity with \"Les Abeilles\" as in this report from the Francophone Jesuits in Canada and Latin America on the consecration of an indigenous peoples' centre in Chiapas region: les droits indigenes au Le nouveau centre servira de de rencontre pour diff\u00e9rents Accessed 18/06/2006 \"3 St. Michael the Archangel shares origins with Roman Mercury and Greek Hermes. According to the foundation legend of Mont St. Michel, he appeared several times to St. Aubert, bishop of Avranches, in 708 CE, telling him to build a church on the island, then known as Mont Tombe. The Bishop ignored him until the archangel burned a hole in his skull with his finger. The church was consecrated Oct. 16, 710. 141 pay attention. We are planning to visit the Canadian War Cemetery at Beny-sur-Mer, which will stir up some deep response. I can feel it coming. This is trying to be a vacation, but continues to be a pilgrimage. Travelling in either case means leaving behind home and familiar objects, as well as habits, routines, and expectations. Today I noticed this: walking along the path beside the cathedral at Bayeux, I encountered a little boy who surprised me by saying, \u00ab Bonjour, madame,\u00bb as he went by. \u00abOh! Bonjour!...(umm, m'sieur? Mon petit? Garcon?).\u00bb In all the shops we've been into, someone always says, and not necessarily the shopkeeper, \u00abBonjour, madame. Bonjour, m'sieur\u00bb and we say \u00abBonjour.\u00bb And when we leave, they say, \u00abAu revoir, madame, au revoir m'sieur\u00bb and we say, \u00abAu revoir\u00bb and \u00abMerci\u00bb whether or not we have bought anything. But this little boy greeted me, and we are not in a shop! I realize in this culture, when entering a public space, one attends to the proxemics: we are sharing the space, however briefly, and we are humans in it together. Mardi 18 mai, Bayeux We arrived early at Arromanches, walking down to the sea wall and onto the beach which stretched for miles. The tide was out and we walked among the remains of the piers from the temporary port\u2014 Mulberry B\u2014of the D-Day landings. Barnacles and mussels encrusted the surface and seaweed grew all over, the huge flat flapping sheets like hands, and the bulbous complicated type. There were hoof prints in the sand, someone had been out riding earlier, with a dog. The wind was fierce, filling our ears and pockets with sand. High winds had delayed D-Day; one could imagine how daunting the weather might have been, that morning in 1944. At the Mus\u00e9e du D\u00e9barquement one learns exhaustively about the installation of the \"mulberries,\" an enormous feat of engineering, planned from 1942 onward, never having been done before. An act of faith, stunning and desperate. By D-Day+9 the mulberry was operational and two million soldiers came through there; General De Gaulle came with the Canadians further east at Courseulles-sur-Mer. There is an impressionistic film to watch at Cin\u00e9ma 360\u00b0 which is a nine screen reconstruction from archival footage. The cameramen had only twenty rolls of one minute each so their footage was compact and intense. This was interspersed with contemporary footage of the same sites. Most touching were scenes of shocked French citizens being helped down the rubble strewn bombed streets of their towns. Unimaginable what it must be like to live through such devastation. [Years later, shock of soft tissue hitting concrete, airborne dust and debris, noise and confusion]. The 360\u00b0 provides a ground level view of the experience, provoking vertigo, dizziness, and nausea. In the lobby, impeccable didactic material on the cinematography. The opening scenes from Private Ryan must have come from this. I searched the young 142 faces in the military scenes for my father. I missed him very much throughout this time. Inland to Beny-sur-Mer near Courseulles. Here the coast wind had dropped and the air was still. Walking along the rows of gravestones with messages from the families carved into each one along with names and dates and ages. Most were boys, 19 to 22 years old, a few as old as 38 and 40. I wondered if my father had known any of these men; the names of the hometowns sounded familiar. The furthest in at the back of the cemetery were dated June 6, 1944 and D+1, June 7, and after that the progress of the invasion was marked by the date on the stones, and the place each body was found, according to the practice of the Commonwealth armies who buried their dead in small local cemeteries. There are row upon row of stones precisely aligned and every possible kind of late spring flower, tulips, roses, dianthus, primula, planted around the base of each one in the long edged beds, but none so high that it would obscure any of the words. A gardener moves around tending the beds. There are no other visitors this afternoon. Two lookout posts with steep staircases frame commemorative installations, big marble and big granite. Everything is immaculately clean, trimmed, swept, pruned. The stones and monuments and benches form rectangles. An atmosphere of stillness and gravitas pervades the austere arrangement, the benches set in niches in the hedge look out onto the wildness of the flowers at the base of each stone, each planting slightly different. It was deeply moving to see such careful maintenance. I felt \"Canadian\" ...what did that mean? A feeling of being part of a very much larger identity, composed of events and individuals whose lives, though unknown to me, had made a difference, whose deaths mattered very much to those who knew them, and even those who did not. \"Scars heal, memory remains,\" said one stone. How do memorials fall into disrepair, overgrown, neglected, forgotten? What keeps memory alive? I thought of my father, young and scared, like the young men in the film footage leaping off the vessels and into the sea towards the beaches and cliffs and into the face of the gunfire from the German pillboxes. Impossible not to feel grief for the young dead boys and the messages of love and missing from their families. Some were searing \u2014\"Oh how I will miss the touch of your hands, your smile, your kiss\" \u2014the stones themselves crying out in the voice of a young widow. I recalled once in a small town where I taught, taking a suicidal young student to the local cemetery to visit the graves of the town's war dead, not much older than he was, and pointing out that any of them would give their left leg to have their life back. What if that were my son's grave? Could I ever console myself with patriotic feeling for such a loss? What else has one got? It hit me then that if it weren't for those dead boys, we'd be living ... differently. 143 Dinner in Paris Mercredi, 19 mai We are having dinner with Pierre and Agn\u00e9s Rosenstiehl this evening; according to our mutual acquaintance, Henry Crapo, it will be at their house, not a restaurant. It dawned on me that flowers might be a good idea. I asked the opinionated young concierge at the front desk, Karine, where to go, cher ou moins? Cher. I could go to Clos de Lias up the street on the corner opposite the Metro, which turned out to be a very pretty store with stands full of flowers outside, tall galvanised florists' buckets full of roses in every colour in the cool shadowy interior. A long convoluted discussion ensued with the serious young shop assistant about whether red roses were appropriate or too narrowly symbolic of passion. These ones are really red, but those are more ombreuse, they are nearly black; perhaps (if everyone's spouses will be present) they could represent (signify?) intellectual passion? Bien. So, working efficiently and without haste, she carefully trimmed two dozen of them and composed a compact bouquet: a layer of roses, a concentric layer of greenery, another layer of roses, more greenery, and so on, then the stems tied with raffia, then a sheet of tissue precisely folded into a polyhedron so that, wrapped around the bouquet, the corners would stick up and frame the blooms just so...then the same operation repeated with a piece of brown wrapping paper... finally raffia tied tightly, with a loop exactly the right length to swing the whole affair from my wrist! All this for 69F. I felt Parisian, walking down the street with my flowers (un bouquet (m) des fleurs (f)). Henry and Pierre arrived to collect us in a beat-up Fiat, the city car (the country car was in the hanger). This explains all the rusty dented little cars in the city, and the luxe sedans outside. Pierre was diffident and amused, we talked about being in choirs, having heard a concert of Charpentier the night before at Notre Dame, and the difference between secular and sacr\u00e9. My friend Bob sang Jerome Kern songs and made everyone laugh. While Pierre was out of the car unlocking the gate to their house, I whispered, \"Quick, Henry, should I avoid the Sacr\u00e9? What do I need to know? Are they Marxists?\" \"No.\" \"Kick me if I get into deep water!\" He laughed and said, \"You're already in deep water, but that way you don't run aground,\" which he and Bob agreed sounded like a line from Being There. A big comfortable whitewashed living-dining-kitchen room, large fireplace, shelves full of books and art and family photos. An artist's house. The roses were a good idea, if a little formal. Agnes' publisher was there, they were planning how to illustrate and market a children's book about creation myths and the history of the world. He had seen my thesis and thought it well organised and illustrated: 144 Rosenstiehl at Chartres....Bien! Before that, who cared? But now\u2014an important mathematician, famous in America! Pierre said he admired the thesis, the trouble that I had taken over the translations of the texts, and that it had revealed to him things he had not seen! I asked how he had got the opening of the labyrinth in the Escher article, was there really a Chinese fan, was it a collaboration with Agnes? No, they said, he was just trying to get the infinite repeat pattern\u2014it was not in any way metaphysical... We talked at length about the hapax, whether it originated with \"happer,\" the intransitive verb from Norse, or \"happer,\" the transitive verb from Latin. What it symbolic of an event such as Pentecost? He liked that, the fire on everyone's heads, the collective intuition. Henry and I talked about exile, whether the labyrinth experience alleviates the chasm of existential homelessness. How arts-based inquiry works. That I liked mathematicians who also do other things, and he likes people who do other things, and who like mathematics. The politics of the imagination, the School of Frankfort, Marcuse and Benjamin. Dinner: liqueur made from white peaches that grow in the vineyards in Burgundy, you can only get it from the farmers, Henry had brought it from the farm next to his, a treat, an occasion. Then: roast red peppers and bread; bifteck saignant (pas sanguinaire...), wild rice, wine gravy; a soft cheese like brie on lettuce; ice cream and strawberries; liqueur. Discussion about Chartres, what Lauren is doing, whether she intended the recovery of the labyrinth as a therapy, a meditation, or a spiritual movement. I do not wish to misrepresent her work, but we do have different perspectives. Agnes thought it all sounded \"Protestant,\" though I tried, in my lame French, to get across the idea that what she was Episcopalian and the movement was non-sectarian: to gain access to the \"divine imagination.\" Argument: people get that effect from long distance running! That's endorphins! I said, the somatic experience may be same, the difference lies in what you call it and do with it: the three paths of the labyrinth finish with communion, to carry the gift out to the world. Ah! C'est la communit\u00e9! It was frustrating to express\u2014to try to express these ideas. Here, the idea of spiritual is profoundly Roman. They appear to find shocking the idea of the Celtic root, which we learn about at my church certainly. How \"American\"! They wanted to know what Chanoine Legaux thought of all this. I said I thought Legaux was a progressive, a member of the Vatican committee for Marian doctrine. That he had said that the Roman Catholic Church had been for too long masculine and hierarchical; that women ought to be priests; that the labyrinth was a symbol and device of Mary. That he and Lauren recount with amusement the story that, during the long negotiation with her organisation Veriditas over the first official use of the 145 labyrinth, in his letters \"il embrassait Lauren fraternellement,\" and is then taken aback when they finally meet. Rosentiehl was a little surprised by all this, I think; in his mind the labyrinth is a homage to Daedalus, who is not a god (but is perhaps a demi-urge?). But my French could not support the discussion of the Jungian Shadow, l'ombre int\u00e9rieur. He thought to walk the labyrinth thinking of psychology was more advanced than the priests. Impossible to express the idea that we are all talking about the same thing. {Well, so I thought at the time. Now perhaps not] Some derogatory remarks about a colleague who was trying to construct bridges between social and hard science, the unlikeliness of knowing enough about both. An uncompromising attitude. In my sketchbook we came to the photographs of my father, the pelerinage a \u00abAh!\u00bb Pierre shook my hand with gratitude.

Photographs of the gathering: \"un moment Susan Sontag.\" (this one: Henry, Vanessa, Pierre, Agn\u00e9s) We celebrated finally meeting and spending time in each other's company: \"Vanessa corporeale, pas seulement courriel!\" I expressed my hope that when my French eventually improves, I may be able to understand better quoi faire Rosenstiehl. We talked of doing further translations of his labyrinth writing into English, ways that I could get back to Paris and work with them. Later, in the car, he spoke of Roland Barthes, what a charming man he had been, rigorous\u2014I should read him in French, although he was very difficult, even for 146 Francophones. We passed the corner of des Ecoles and Cardinal Lemoine where the car accident had occurred; he had died three months later of pneumonia. Triste. Jeudi, 20 mai. Raining. Les parapluies du Quartier Latin. Recalling the fragments of conversation. It is very strange to sit in a group that is composed of two languages. All bright people, well-intentioned, thinking subtle and sophisticated thoughts, unable to communicate them. It is exhausting to figure out what they are talking about, and what they thought of it, and what we think of it, and what we should say, and then translate it. Nevertheless I have bought three of Barthes' books en Francais: Le Lecon, Ecriture Degr\u00e9 Zero, Mythologies. Giverny in the rain. Another pilgrimage site, damp and lovely. Every colour in the world. A translucent pink rose that brought up the memory of my mother's Elizabeth Arden face powder on her dressing table\u2014I took some petals and pressed them in my book. Arbours heavy with sprays of climbing roses; a clutter of gardening tools at one end of a walkway, trugs of weeds, deadheads, prunings. Vendredi, 21 mai Here I am not writing anything, just sitting in a whirlwind of recasting the conversations of the last fortnight into French. I want to tell Pierre, as if it mattered. Some t\u00e9n\u00e9bres mysterieuses that pull me in, I do not yet know why. I get glimpses in Pierre's stuff about parallels between search theory and human thinking. It is an academic pleasure to say, Man\" in his presence. I am still new at this, still need scaffolding and context, training wheels.'\" This trip has been full, pilgrimage at many levels, to Chartres and Notre-Dame; Mont Giverny, and the American Impressionist Museum; to sit at the feet of Rosenstiehl; the \"Lady and the Unicorn\" at the Cluny. Samedi, 22 mai. Tomorrow is Pentecost. At St. Paul's back home they will be singing (without me!) that beautiful hurrying scurrying Andrew Donaldson arrangement of Psalm 139, ''4 Aware also of what Cixous is saying: \"women more often than men ... are immediately asked in whose name and from what theoretical standpoint they are speaking, who is their master and where are they coming from: they have, in short to salute...and show their identity papers\" (1981) 147 \"Where Can I Go?\" \u2014 the one that has the sopranos and basses beseeching each other, \"Where can I flee? Where can I hide?\" A great piece of music. Yesterday was long. Mercifully, all the cultural institutions are en gr\u00e9ve so we wandered: through an exhibition along the Pont des Arts of giant mud and cloth sculptures of people with beautifully modelled faces, representing different African tribes, by an artist from Dakar; the courtyards of the Louvre, were packed with people, but the M. Pei pyramid in the centre was new to me and wonderful, especially the walkways between sections of raised pools, so it looks like people are walking up to their knees through water. Onward through the covered arcades of the Palais Royale and memories from thirty years ago, walking with my mother and seeing Leonor Fini paintings in the window of a gallery. Alas, the strike had caused the Carmina Burana concert at the Cluny to be cancelled\u2014 \u00abDesol\u00e9e, Madame! \u00bb Instead, the view past the obelisk at the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe. The monumental scale of the big public places in the city contrasts with the particularity of some of the white and blue street signs, attached to corners of buildings, that recall the dates and contributions of the individuals after whom the street is named: a member of the Resistance, a particular scholar.\"' The streets rarely meet at right angles either, so people don't turn the corner and disappear quite so quickly, one doesn't leave things behind as abruptly; like the centuries of history, their memory lingers. Bachelard, who lived here, knew this: \"in its countless alveoli space contains compressed time. That is what space is for\" ( p.8). \"5 From an encyclopaedic expat website: In Paris, street names often have something in common in a given neighborhood (for instance: around Saint Lazare station: names of European cities, around Institut Pasteur: names of scientists, around Pigalle: names of sculptors, etc., the interior ring road - Blvd. des Mar\u00e9chaux - is composed of 22 boulevards, each of them with the name of a marshall of Napoleon). Street numbers start at the River Seine (except for the avenues starting from the Arch of Triumph.) Street names give a good idea of the French national heroes. In any French city, you will find the major avenues with the names of Victor Hugo (the illustrious XIXth century poet), Jean Jaures (the founder of the Socialist party, a Renaissance man, humanist and brilliant lover of Greek literature, a pacifist murdered a few days before WW1 broke out), Jean Moulin (the most revered figure of the resistance in WW2, arrested and murdered by the Nazis without having denounced anyone), other heroes of the resistance ( Pierre Brossollette, Daniele Casanova, Paul Vaitlant-Couturier ), Gambetta (one of the of the Republican regime in the 1870s), Alsace-Lorraine (annexed by Germany between 1871 and 1918), Aristide-Briand (a politician between WW1 and WW2), Stalingrad, Charles de Gaulle, Jeanne d'Arc, etc...

Accessed 19/06/2006. 148 I wanted to visit the Rodin Museum again. The garden was beautiful\u2014I had not noticed it before. Big round pond with water the colour of verdigris, opaque. Narrow water gardens down the side of the all\u00e9es, with Siberian irises blooming; a spectacular rose garden in the front of the house. This time I attended to the section on Camille Claudel. A tragic life, in the end. I was surprised to note that I have moved on from Rodin. At 23 I was delighted to be here. As a very young sculptor, I could shelter under his broad wing. Now, 24 years later, with a lot of bronze-casting experience under my belt, I do not feel the same congruence, although the sculptures are magnificent and his studio is enviable! A benchmark. I am more attracted to the less tangible. There it is \u2014 voila. Pentecd\u00e9te. After taking the M\u00e9tro as early as we could to the Tuileries yesterday and still finding the tour buses lined up already, we decided to do nothing on purpose. Out of the blue we came upon an exhibition in the courtyard at the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts, \"Jorge Luis Borges 1899-1999,\" at centenary of the writer's birth: the Great Daedalus himself! All around the domed courtyard of the Art School were windows facing into messy studios\u2014like any 200 year old art school. The exhibition was installed on a two storey construction like a stage set, interconnecting staircases and balconies in reference to the library/labyrinth motif.\"\u00b0 All the way round were large vitrines and in the centre space all his honourary academic gowns hanging empty. At one end was a sculpture of a book, very large, like the old illuminated manuscripts, titled \"All of life exists to become a book.\" It was a mechanical piece that flipped its pages as it \"breathed\" showing at the beginning cuneiform and pictographs, and ending with a computer screen set into the table surface. The cases were jammed full of the history of Borges' life and collections of his objects: canes, an ow] sculpture from his parents' house, strange and wonderful drawings and paintings, even his natal horoscope! (full of squares and oppositions); all his publications and the books he had read and annotated. That was the most interesting, what he had studied and felt as an influence: poetry, history, geography of different places\u2014also very clearly a sense of place in his daily life, the walled gardens of Argentina for example. Other influences include Vikings, Icelanders, the tango, gauchos. There http://marciana. venezia.sbn.it/news2/eng/2-12e.htm . Accessed 19/06/2006 149 commentaries on the influence he had had on others, plus dozens of honorary degrees, medals, prizes and honours from around the world. It was stunning to see how he had wandered, humbly it appeared, in his life through some extreme thick and thins, such as getting fired from his library job in Argentina for writing articles critical of the government. A dangerous time. What came through most powerfully was how he had persevered and followed his interests. It was a great, inspiring exhibition. What stood out were: the \"autre tigre\" painting with calligraphy in behind; the painting on newspaper of bones and people; and especially the tactile quality of the exhibit\u2014not that we could touch, but that these were objects that he had touched, in his blindness. And that he drew on graph paper. The end of the journal from France. 150 Return, re-entry, \"reaggregation\" Coming home from France brought mixed feelings: in part, the \"After enlightenment, the laundry\" let down \u2014 Ontario felt raw and new, after medieval Normandy\u2014 and did I really want to wash away the grains of sand from Juno Beach? (each grain a world now illustrated with a layer of archival . \u00e9 footage, as well as the view from a German pillbox, sinking beneath the shifting dunes). As well, parallel to the physical distancing was the withdrawal into the temporal distance of the felt experience of place, with its the encapsulation and storage of events, to be recalled from memory with as much detail as possible\u2014who knows how fragile those percepts might be (unless we can count on biting into and activating our own personal madeleine)? But these events are collected and connected in a webbing of emotional affect, and that had been considerably augmented. Although not strictly a liminal ritual\u2014Turner would categorize such individual, voluntary undertakings as \"liminoid\"!\"'in comparison to the socially obligatory actions characteristic of agrarian, tribal society\u2014nevertheless, during the evenings of meditation and walking the labyrinth at Chartres cathedral, time and space had been set aside and made distinct. The events framed by these distinctions had been profound for the participants. The three stages of transitional ritual''* had been discernible, especially the second evening in the cathedral that began underground in the crypt with us naming, writing down and then consigning our old definition-demons to the fire, before retracing the footsteps of thel 3% century catechumens, coming up from darkness into the light and passing through the convolutions of the labyrinth to some newborn state. The entire week's cycle of lectures, small group work, touring\u2014itself a form of textual study\u2014 and solitary meditation made up \"!\" \"Genres that I would be inclined to call 'liminoid,' 'liminal-like' rather than 'liminal' ... are historically connected with and often displace rituals which possess true liminal phases, and they also share important characteristics with liminal processes and states, such as \"subjectivity,\" escape from the classifications of everyday life, symbolic reversals, destruction\u2014at a deep level\u2014 of social distinctions, and the like; nevertheless, liminoid genres differ from liminal phases in ways which indicate major differences in the societies of which they respectively constitute major modes of reflexive stock-taking\" (1979, p.115). 118.\" separation from ordinary social life; margin or limen (threshold), when the subjects of ritual enter a limbo between their past and present modes of daily existence; and re-aggregration, when they are ritually returned to secular or mundane life \u2014 either at a higher status level or in an altered state of consciousness or social being\" (van Gennep in Turner, 1979, p. 95). 1S] a larger ritual of retreat and development. So the adjustment process of returning to \"mundane life in an altered state of consciousness\" was an awkward but necessary step. The questions raised in the discussion with the Rosenstiehls are pertinent: is it therapy? Spirituality? Psychological investigation? Self-indulgent American Protestantism? To what end are these efforts, and on whose behalf: the individual, or the community? These questions illuminate the polarities of modernity. To take the time to develop one's imagination in such a context can be seen as both transgressive and escapist. But if, as Turner says, \"to look at itself.a society must cut out a piece of itself for inspection.... it must set up a frame within which images and symbols of what has been sectioned off can be scrutinized, assessed, and if need be, remodelled and rearranged\" (1979, pp. 96-97), then from that perspective, a ritual of self examination has an impact beyond the scope of the individuals involved. Spending time away from fast-paced modern society, immersed in the slow rhythms of what the ancients called epimel\u00e9sthai sautou, \"care of the self' (Foucault, 1988, p. 19) and Soul in a medieval environment is counter-cultural in the most restorative, civilisation-enhancing sense. The emphasis in the week at Chartres was on the private, interior clarification and understanding of collective shared images, and the enhancement of the skilled use of metaphor, through a combination of pedagogies that included experiential, embodied learning, and a slightly guided form of the pediahaptic. In a culture that has abandoned the Imagination to the marketing and entertainment industries, neglected the Soul to the point of terminal systemic dysfunction and trivialised the Sacred almost beyond saving, this focus is unorthodox, but it is very much in keeping with what is known of the educational practices of the School of Chartres. The medieval craft of thought Following Plato's suggestion that the artisanal approach in the carpenter or physician or ship captain's desire to make things well, fitting, and serviceable, is a proper model for the philosopher's task of argument construction on behalf of identifying of the reliably true, medieval monastics and scholars applied the concept of \"spiritual craftsmanship\" to their reading, study, and especially to the practice of meditation. The specific set of practices\u2014 techn\u00e9 \u2014 originated with a key text from Paul (1 Corinthians 3:10-17), where comparing himself to a \"master-builder,\" Paul says, \"I have laid the foundation and another buildeth 152 thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon,\" an architectural metaphor that provided a \"place\" both to store images and to create from them, and the method by which to do so (Carruthers, 2005, p. 17). Monastic meditation required the crafting of memories, and the images with which to convey and manipulate them; essentially, things to think with. Because it was a locational system\u2014a mnemonic based in the floor plan, elevation, and experience of a particular architectural site or environment\u2014 all the senses were brought into the process to ensure the image would be vivid, memorable, evocative. In the Middle Ages, invention or \"creative thinking\" was the domain of the academic discipline of rhetoric: \"in western monasticism, the craft of rhetoric became primarily focussed not on tasks of public persuasion but on tasks of what is essentially literary invention.\" The Latin word inventio is the basis for two terms in English: \"invention,\" which we use to refer to a function of creativity, the engendering of something new and different; the other is \"inventory,\" the place and means of orderly storage and categorisation of diverse things, making them secure and immediately retrievable. Thus \"creativity\" in classical and Medieval culture required having \"inventory\" to invent from and with, a memory-store that was effectively \"inventoried,\" its contents in readily-recovered \"locations.\" Indeed, \"some type of locational structure is a prerequisite for any inventive thinking at all\" (pp. 11-12). Because all memories originate in the past, what distinguishes them is the qualities of place where they are stored and the affect associated with them. Memory functions as a sign system, with cues that bring up the associated experiences.'? All memories are also mental images known as phantasiai, a term which, in rhetoric, was generally reserved for emotionally-laden fictions that act powerfully in memory and on the mind. Further, and expanding on the concept of similitudines introduced in the previous chapter, ' Vico, writing in the early 18\" century, proposed a three-component model of the primitive mind\u2014the fantasia, the ingegno, and the memoria\u2014suggests that the brain's capacities to manufacture images is more fundamental than its abstract computational abilities. The latter are, in fact, derivatives of the former. The model explains how the transition from perception to conception might have occurred, and how the ingegno is the force behind human creativity. Working in tandem with the fantasia, the ingegno undergirds all our symbolic cultural artefacts\u2014musical compositions, paintings, scientific theories, etc. Metaphor, on the other hand, allows the mind to transcend its own surface level cognitive architecture to create new conceptual domains, to make new associations, to invent new cultural institutions all the time. [Fantasia = imagination; ingegno = skill, talent, genius, brains; memoria = memory, reminiscence.] Danesi, 1993, p. 66. 153 Memory images are composed of two elements: a \"likeness\" (similitudo) that serves as a cognitive cue or token to the \"matter\" or res being remembered, and intentio or the \"inclination\" or \"attitude\" we have to the remembered experience, which helps both to classify and to retrieve it. Thus memories are all images, and they are all and always emotionally coloured. Pre-modern psychologies recognized the emotional basis of remembering, and considered memories to be bodily \"affects\"; the term affectus included all kinds of emotional reactions (Carruthers, p.14). Memory was understood as a personal interpretation, inevitably coloured by one's intentio, which included physical, emotional, rational, and cultural dimensions.'\" The discipline of memory storage and retrieval, and the creativity based upon it, were organised around the mnemonic image of architecture, originally based on those examples which were measured and described in the Old Testament.' But this compositional device was not treated as a diagram with a single overt meaning, nor a mathematical function sign initiating a single operation , but rather, as a vehicle of hermeneutic inquiry for teasing out subtle meanings. The difference in approach depends on whether a book or a church is an object to be observed and studied for what is in itself\u2014 an encyclopaedia in symbol-language, or whether one thinks of a book or a church as a machine, a tool people use for social purposes such as symbol-making. It's the difference between considering the work you are contemplating as an end or a means (Augustinian); between enjoying something for its own sake and using it for social, that is, ethical purposes (Christians strive to be \"citizens\" of the City of God) (p. 18) The way the exegetical and compositional process worked was be to take the text through a sequence of interpretive moves, as illustrated here by Gregory the Great: \"First we put in place the foundations of literal meaning [historia]; then through typological interpretation we build up the fabric of our mind in the walled city of faith; and at the end, through the grace of \"2\u00b0 Cicero used the word intentio almost as English uses the word \"tuning,\" as a musician tightens (the root meaning of intendo) the strings of an instrument. Cicero describes the Stoic philosopher Aristoxenus of Tarentum as a \"musician as well as philosopher, who held the soul to be a special tuning-up of the natural body analogous to that which is called harmony in vocal and instrumental music; answering to the nature and confirmation of the whole body, vibrations of different kinds are produced just as sounds are in vocal music\" (Carruthers, p.15). \"2! Construction of the world [Genesis |], Ark [Gen 6], enclosure of the Tabernacle {Exodus 25-27], the the Temple of Solomon [1 Kings 6] (Carruthers, p. 18). These edifices were analysed in Brun\u00e9s' history of Sacred Geometry. 154 our moral understanding, as though with added colour, we clothe the building\" (p.18). The rhetorician could assume that the audience would be familiar with the reference to \"walled city of faith,\" which would resonate with the common store of Biblical images, including John's heavenly Jerusalem, the citadel of Ezekiel, Matthew's city on a hill. Carruthers points out that Gregory uses the word historia where later writers speak of sensus litteralis: \"Biblical histories, especially of the OT, are treated as though each were a story-outline, one of One Hundred Great Plots, whose chief purpose is to be retold\" (p. 19). This idea is echoed in Frye's view that the Bible, as myth, should be the foundation of the literature curriculum, because \"its imaginative survey of the human situation is so broad and comprehensive that everything else finds a place inside it\" (1963, p.46). Frye would agree with Hugh of St. Victor's comment that \"Already the foundations of the story have been laid in you: it remains now that you found the basis of the superstructure\" to \"be able to build into this structure whatever one afterwards finds\" in the \"great sea of books and ... the manifold intricacies of opinions\" that one will encounter throughout one's own life (in Carruthers, p.20). The gradual accretion of personal associations and interpretations upon the underlying foundation of the great shared story was considered a kind of \" 'chain-making' or catena...intricate chains of stories, woven together in the activities of memory, are a characteristic medieval habit of mind\" (Carruthers, p.147).'\" Communal images, private labyrinths Using communal images and storylines \u2014-understood to be metaphorical \u2014 as the foundation for building inventive personal interpretation establishes shared yet diverse reality and common cause. As well, that form of invention increases and refreshes the collective language of symbolism used to fulfill the major function of ritual: the need for reflection and the collective re-aggregation, as part of, and on behalf of, the larger community. As Rohr reminds us: \"your life is not about you!\" Going beyond speculation to praxis gives access to \"that strange liminal space\u2014in all of us, but more speakingly so in artists\u2014where, as Dilthey writes, \"life discloses itself at a depth inaccessible to observation, reflection, and theory.' \" '? See also Doob, especially pp. 203-210, on the \"implicitly labyrinthine aesthetics\" of the literary and visual forms known as interlace, where patterning of events takes precedence over temporal sequence, and the integrity and symmetry of the overall form is grasped in spite of the fragmentary nature of the presentation. 155 (Turner, 1982, p. 15). While pilgrimage is a deeply personal undertaking, the cumulative effect is the realization, both humbling and exhilarating, that one is part of a much larger entity, a balancing act with symbolism that recalls the struggle with grandiosity.'\" Should this activity find expression in works of art, so much the better, in Turner's opinion, because \"readers, viewers, and hearers can reflect upon them since they are trustworthy messages from our species' depths, humanized life disclosing itself.\" z In that regard, two events stand out as epiphanies: the encounter with the chimera- translator on the tower, which later took form in the collage \"Les Gargouilles de Notre- Dame,\" and the inspiration to make the \"The BVM & the kids\" collage. I had with me the photograph of my children, plus some art supplies I'd brought along, and everywhere in the shops one could find good quality postcards of every detail of the cathedral (a means of mass image dissemination not unlike the pilgrims' badges of the time'), so the means to manipulate images was available. That Wednesday was the third day in Chartres, long enough to have recovered from the disruptions of travelling and settled into a habitus. The lectures were rich with possibilities of new perspectives\u2014\"a chalice of images,\" Lauren said '3 See e.g. Von Franz: \"In order to understand the symbolic indications of the unconscious, one must be careful not to get outside oneself but to stay emotionally within oneself. Only if I remain an ordinary human being, conscious of my incompleteness, can I become receptive to the significant contents and processes of the unconscious. But how can a human being stand the tension of feeling himself at one with the whole universe, while at the same time he is only a miserable earthly human creature? If, on the one hand, I despise myself as merely a statistical cipher, my life has no meaning and is not worth living. But if, on the other hand, | feel myself to be part of something much greater, how am I to keep my feet upon the ground?\" (1964, p. 236). 4See http://www.ariadne.org/cc/badges/newbadges.html and Chartres Pilgrim Badges\" Perigrinations.

We were intently focused on the meaning of Mary, \"tuning\" to her qualities of courage, openness, receptivity, mercy, her ability to \"Let it be,\" balanced by her practice of pondering things in her heart; focused also on the means by which those attributes were being conveyed to us, the \"crossing languages\" of architecture, iconography, ritual and metaphor. \"Intuitions occur to a person without any known process of cogitation or reflective thinking\" (Hillman, 1996, p. 98), but they may be made more welcome by charitable intentions.'\" We were encouraged to notice the Veil, its density, thinning, and falling away, the sense of being able to cross over between the visible and the invisible. Gradually, engaging with the labyrinth and the cathedral as a medium or an \"Other\" emerged as a way of knowing. That day I began to perceive the \"speakingness\" of the cathedral as the conveyance of Mary's message, as it had been understood by the builders. Mary-as-text merged with cathedral-as-fabric, a text-ile woven intentionally that I and all of us might \"read\" it, through our incarnate sensing bodies. In the labyrinth that night I finally and clearly felt the message as a sense of peace about my children, an intuitive knowing that they were safe \u2014 in a walled city and in the arms, and under the watchful and amused gaze, of the Madonna. It was a great relief to just \"know\" that She would take care of them (and me) if (when) I stumbled, and if She could so graciously prevail as a mother, so might I. The intuition was illuminated in the process of making the collage, and further clarified by studying the nuances in the artwork itself in reflection afterwards: the way the red candle lights in the crypt hallway are echoed in layout and transformed in colour, by the blue 'Sewels\" in the glass; that the children and the Mother are all inside the walled city, looking out at the viewer, and does the viewer ever get to be in there too? Who does the viewer identify with? the children? The Child? The Mother? The fortress? The brilliant light...?'\u00b0 5 \"Caritas,\" or \"benevolentia\" were the desired rhetorical intentions, attitudes of trust and good will. \"Augustine: 'I call charity a movement of the mind toward [the goal of] fruitfully enjoying God for His own sake, and [my]self and my neighbour for God's sake.' A 'movement of the mind toward' something involves not only affectus, or emotion, but also intentio\" (Carruthers, p. 15, 16). \"6 All of these are possible in the medieval pictorial genre. The painter of a 14\" century cityscape showing a multiplicity of perspectives believed that \"he could render what he saw before his eyes convincingly by representing what it felt like to walk about, experiencing structures, almost tactilely, from many different sides, rather than from a single, overall vantage\" (Edgerton in Romanyshyn, 1989, p. 35) 157 The visit later that week with Notre-Dame de la Pili\u00e9re, where, in answer to my question about purpose, the image presented itself of Mary reading a book at the moment of the Annunciation, was an affirmation of the earlier encounter with the chimera-translator. The little stone creature invited associations and identification by its mysterious nature: the range of realms it could traverse, with wings, fins, clawed feet, fire-proof nostrils; its small size and obscured placement high up the tower would keep it easily overlooked, yet protected, and with a view; a combination of qualities and circumstances that provoked both sympathy and curiosity, resonating inwardly as \"T wonder what that feels like.\" And yet, even so strange and unlikely a one was included in the architectural homage to Mary and the Order of Things. The experience included both the artisan's body memories of carving material as recalcitrant as Chartres' limestone,'\"' and the hand's longing for tools and material: an identification with the art object from multiple perspectives, and with the maker of that object. This is a solidarity reaching across centuries. With that constellation of percepts and meanings activated, along with Geraldine's comment about inter-modal translation, and the lecture content about discernment among voices, a context was created for the intuition presented of Mary reading. In Marian scholarship, the image of Mary reading a book suggests three things: that Mary can read, and is therefore an educated woman; that, \"7 The stone used for the sculpture is limestone with a much finer and regular grain than that of the stone of Berch\u00e9res that had served for the architecture; it's from the Liassic layers of Paris or the quarries neighbouring the banks of the Seine or the Oise rivers. http://www.chartres-csm.org/us_fixe/cathedrale/sculptures.html. Limestones are usually rated at 3 on the Mohs scale of hardness, but sometimes rate as high as 7. Diamond is the hardest mineral, at 10; bronze is rated 3. 158 represented reading prophecies which she is about to fulfill, the idea is expressed that her life has a pre-ordained purpose in which she has the choice to agree to participate; and that Mary's life is a \"text\" to be \"read\" by others.' As the life of Mary becomes the intention of the builders and the text of the cathedral (the labyrinth being the condensed version of the message); the participant, cued by all the subliminal and overt guidance, finds herself communing with and comforted by the original radical Creatrix. From that encounter springs another generation of symbolic imagery informed by those centuries of hermeneutic dialogue. Out of itself the rational unfolds the non-rational: one can almost see the immeasurable diagonal of sacred geometry's V rectangles, calving metaphors. Tuning oneself to that intentionally non-rational spatial environment makes it possible, and more likely, that the iron-clad veil of our rationality may thin and fall away: \"If you want to take your consciousness up an octave, to a place that doesn't exist in the physical, rational world, why not put your body at, say, the center of a double square\u2014 at the intersection of two lines that don't quite exist?\" (Lonegren, 2001, p. 17).'\" Pulling together the threads that run through this account is the idea of patterns distilled through a multi-sensorial perceptual event: a link, for example, between the \"concatenation\" Rosenstiehl's search algorithm grammar-pathway in \"Les Mots\" (1980, p.100), and the catena of the medieval chain of memory association (another form of search algorithm); how as pilgrims we walk in the steps of those who have gone before us, that ideas echo across time, and that plainsong chanted reverberates perfectly in the precise acoustics of a Gothic cathedral; that the pattern of the labyrinth, the geometry of the cathedral, and the enduring symbolism of Mary are all codes. These codes are messages, entelechies, fterma teachings, possible futures. Bachelard reminds us that 128 Leclerq, J. OSB, \"Mary's Reading of Christ,\" hittp://www.udayton, Accessed 5/30/2006. \"2\u00b0 Alex Champion, biochemist and earthwork labyrinth builder, sees the pattern as a kind of environmental tuning fork: \"The labyrinth is ringing, and your body starts ringing sympathetically once you walk. If there are stuck blocks of energy inside your own energy field as a result of painful experiences in life, the longer you work with the labyrinth, the greater the chance that those blocks will get shaken loose, and shaken free, from all this vibrating\" (in West, 2000, p. 43). Champion keeps detailed observations of labyrinth experience, his own as builder and participant, and surveys of other participants at http://www.earthsymbols.com/ 159 the relation of a new poetic image to an archetype lying dormant in the depths of the unconscious is not a causal one. It is not an echo of the past. On the contrary, through the brilliance of the image, the distant past resounds with echoes, and it is hard to know at what depth these echoes will reverberate and die away (1994, p. xvi). Sometimes, if we can hold the sound of the echo long enough, we can register what it is we have done, and what is required of us next.

(Lippard, 1995, p.125) Keepers of a community labyrinth navigate amongst many paradoxes including its identity as an artefact of ancient origin and, simultaneously, a staging ground for both a pre- and a post- modern search for meaning. This combination of tradition and potentiality can be read in a number of ways depending on context, setting, and language. The observation that \"because it has boundaries and a beginning and an end, you can walk into a whole other world that's set aside as a spiritual place\" (Artress in Gallagher, 1998, p.160) has profound implications for a community \u2014in this instance, congregational, but as easily, a hospital board\u2014 negotiating the meaning around the stewardship of public space as outward sign. The labyrinth is two dimensional, yet not a painting or a window; non-representational, but not exactly abstract; a spatial enclosure, but not a chapel or a garden or a chancel; underfoot, but the Way rather than \"in the way\": into what categories of thought and resource \"purposing\" would the labyrinth fit, in a parish report or a funding proposal? What language conveys its objective? How is the image understood as communal? To think of the labyrinth as public art by recalling its original identity in the cathedral creates a connection across the intervening centuries and the cultural divide exemplified in modernism. The art object in the context of the modernist artworld system is regarded as the product of an autonomous, socially isolated individual artist, to be viewed as \"neutral\" entertainment by an essentially passive spectator audience (Gablik, 1991, 1995)'\u00b0 or, in Benjamin's analysis, as a fetish, valued for its \"aura\" by the connoisseur (1968). In contrast, none of the sculptures, windows, or architectural components of the cathedral, including the '\u00b0 Gablik is critical of the limits of modernist aesthetics: \"Modernist aesthetics, concerned with itself as the chief source of value, did not inspire creative participation; rather, it encouraged distancing and depreciation of the Other. Its nonrelational, noninteractive, nonparticipatory orientation did not easily accommodate the more feminine values of care and compassion, of seeing and responding to need. The notion of power that is implied by asserting one's individuality and having one's way through being invulnerable leads, finally, to a deadening of empathy. The model of the artist as a lone genius struggling against society does not allow us to focus on the beneficial and healing role of social interaction\" (1995, p. 80). See also Berger, Another way of telling (1982), and Gablik, Conversations before the end of time (1997). 162 labyrinth, were considered or intended to be either merely decorative or the personal aesthetic statements of the artists. The labyrinth pattern evolved, as we have seen, in an intellectual environment of shared public images, meanings, and metaphors. In its architectural expression, it was an integral part of a system designed to enhance the formation within the imagination of each individual worshiper, in response to the text of the cathedral, of networks of exploratory and creative images. This purpose assumed as given the presence of an \"inventory\" of images and associations upon which the inner hermeneutic exploration would draw. In this sense, the relationship between the labyrinth as \"art object\" and the participant can be characterised as interactive (it would be misleading to describe the perceiver of the labyrinth as a \"viewer,\" 99 66 \"spectator,\" \"consumer\" or \"audience\" although all these terms may be used of modernist art transactions). In this quality of relationship, the labyrinth as a technology of encounter (a \"geometry of welcome\") has much in common with the \"new genre\" public art which expresses an emerging aesthetic of connection, compassion, sense of place and ecological awareness, and commitment to a prophetic dimension. Where the medieval era was an oral culture (moving to chirographic, and on the verge of the print revolution'*'), our present post-modern period seems to be shifting to an auditory orientation, with \"the historical potential for a paradigm shift displacing vision and installing the very different influence of listening,\" a particular kind of \"enlightened listening\" directed towards the achievement of shared understanding, which, \"informed by an interactive and receptive normativity, generates a very different episteme and ontology\" (Levin in Gablik, 1995, p. 83), due in part to the intimate, relational nature of the sense of hearing and the affective impact of auditory stimuli. \"Listening\"'' may involve more than the apprehending of sound: Levin refers to the \"need to think about 'practices of the self? that understand the 5) See Lowe, 1982 and Ong, 1977. '2 of O.E. Alystan (see list (v.2)). For vowel evolution, see bury. http://www.etymonline.com 163 essential intertwining of self and other, self and society, and that are aware of the subtle complexities of this intertwining\" (in Gablik, 1995, p.80). Such practices should heighten awareness of and, recalling Cicero, attunement to percepts of self and other (including the transpersonal) on the border states between the tactile and the not (yet) conscious or even the supra-rational, dimensions most readily accessible through the metaphorical languages of poetry and phenomenology. Bachelard opens up the concept, and the mystery, of \"listening\" when he suggests that to experience the being of an image, we have to experience its reverberation in the manner of Minkowski's phenomenology [which holds that] the essence of life is not \"a feeling of being, of existence,\" but a feeling of participation in a flowing onward, necessarily expressed in terms of time, and secondarily expressed in terms of space. Minkowski's choice of what he calls an auditive metaphor, retentir (reverberate), is very apt, for in sound both time and space are epitomized (1994, xvi, n. 1). The idea that time and space are epitomized in sound suggests two things. First, if silence can also be considered sound, then in order to be able to hear, and so to listen, an aptitude for a receptive silence (not a numb, dazed, frozen, encapsulated or terrorized silence!) is a fundamental \"practice of the self\" to cultivate, necessary and difficult in noisy contemporary society, not one widely supported outside of meditation classes and Buddhist sanghas. Secondly, if space is epitomized in sound, then so could be the concept of place, refuge, retreat, and \"home.\" Lippard observes of the relations between art, artist, and intention that \"art cannot be a centering (grounding) device unless the artist herself is centered and grounded. This is not to say that the alienated, the disoriented, the deracinated, the nomadic (i.e., most of us) cannot make art. But some portable place must rest in our souls\" (1995, p. 128, emphasis added). This is a significant insight into the contemporary state of what Greene calls \"seekingness\" for which the labyrinth is a perfect vehicle: a technology for finding your way \"home.\" This is a primary reason for the success of community based labyrinths today. 164 The labyrinth and the community No matter where and what kind of labyrinth you build, once you've made the decision to create a labyrinth, begin to relate to it as a real being, even though it is not yet \"birthed.\" (West, 2000, p. 71) Two different aspects of the labyrinth as a public community-based form of art stand out: the complex and extenuated process of bringing it into being in the physical midst of the community; and, once installed, formalising the ritual of walking it together and accommodating the protocols for its use into the fabric of parish life. As an art object \"made\" by the community in a church setting, depending on the location in the building, the labyrinth underlies the daily life of an active parish and transforms space that the congregation considers both \"public\" (with regard to the many service and support groups that meet in its rooms, and the marriages, funerals, counselling sessions and so on that take place there) and also emphatically \"theirs.\" At St. Paul's, located in the university part of town, we had done a fair amount of self-examination around identity and mission, and understood ourselves to be inclusive, open to new forms of celebrating that included a commitment to a regularly scheduled Taiz\u00e9 service, curious enough to run study groups about Celtic Christianity, body prayer, dialogues amongst faith communities, and homosexuality, and far from fixed in our certainty of what was the Truth. Though not quite ready as some in the Anglican Communion to empty the pews out of the nave,'\u00ae the congregation was willing to consider yet another layer of activity in the multi-purpose space of the parish hall, albeit a semi-permanent and highly visible one. The steps in imagining what having a labyrinth could be like (\"Ideas catch fire in dialogue, when one person's eyes light up as another conjures images,\" says Lippard, p.126), planning it, inviting a committee together, coming to an agreement, disseminating information, spearheading a campaign, generating support, getting the go-ahead, attaining the funds, scheduling the layout and installation, gathering the volunteers, prayerfully laying out the pattern and rendering the design into a more permanent form, completing and admiring it, 3 The movement to make liturgical space more architecturally available to changing needs was nascent in the Anglican Church in Canada. Sison, M. \"Altering the altar,\" Anglican Journal January 2005, p.3. See Giles, R. Re-pitching the Tent, Canterbury Press (2004), for a critique of traditional church interiors as a \"living liturgical nightmare.\" 165 becoming aware of it as \"sacred space,\" showing it to others from outside the immediate \"family,\" inviting them to see it too, becoming an example and a destination in the larger community, are specific stages of any large project that take on a particular quality in parish life, a form of cathedral-building campaign, writ small. (Leaky roofs and cantankerous furnaces trump \"re-flooring\" projects every time.) Communication The pattern of the labyrinth, especially the circular Chartres type, challenges forth embodied knowledge, provoking a visceral response which can easily be interpreted as discomfort and side-stepped as negative. The language used to introduce and report on the project therefore needed to be carefully calibrated for a wide audience. With a heterogeneous congregation at various levels of spiritual maturity, frequent opportunities for input and updating were necessary. Making sure that the labyrinth was seen, experienced, and understood as a safe place was essential. As the labyrinth project instigator and shepherd over the six years at St. Paul's, I found that academic language was less effective than a more informal story-telling style for updates in the newsletter and annual vestry report. These, along with a frequently refurbished bulletin board and a rack of guides and pamphlets on the wall beside the labyrinth, provided information for people who had happened upon the labyrinth and were curious, as well as those more experienced participants who were interested in the larger labyrinth community beyond St. Paul's. Interest from the news media played a part in some of our decisions concerning outreach, as we began to get more regular attendance to our monthly guided walks, becoming a \"destination\" for seekers. Both Rev. Doran and I had been to Grace Cathedral and to Chartres, and he to Taiz\u00e9 as well, so we shared an interest in the inquiry into how the labyrinth-in-community process might unfold at St. Paul's, from our different perspectives as parishioner/artist/student and senior priest/go-to guy/complaints department. Two pieces of our writing about the same period of time and sequence of events illustrate our respective processes of exploration and communication: the first, a summary written for the quarterly newsletter, The Second Reading, and then Rev. Doran's sermon (on Luke 13: 10-15, the crippled woman healed on the Sabbath) about the labyrinth as the healer of knots. In both, we take pains to examine the value of our work and our use of time, and what we 166 perceive as the impact on others of the labyrinth in our midst. We point out the links between the particular, our local experience, our specific cherished beliefs, and the general, referring to other labyrinth keepers, the communion of saints, the larger human story. Looking back now, what stands out is the pattern of initiative, embroilment and perplexity, illuminating intuitive image, a phase of pondering towards provisional meaning, a sense of overview, and re-engagement: a form of the classic meander. 167 \"The Most Recent Adventures of the Labyrinth at St. Paul's\" The Second Reading Those of you who are new to St. Paul's will have noticed the strange pattern of circles and turns and pointy bits on the parish hall floor: this is our version of the Chartres Cathedral eleven circuit unicursal pavement Labyrinth, to give its full descriptive title, and it is a place for walking meditation when you follow the path to the centre and trace it back out again. Those of you who have been here longer may have noticed that the pattern is now boldly laid out in glossy black enamel paint, replacing the beloved but increasingly dog- eared \"Sacred Electrician's Tape\" version that served us since August 2000. Before that we had a painted one, and before that a tape one, and before that another tape one. We have had a labyrinth at St. Paul's since April of 1997! This is the story of the newest one. One afternoon last March, Paddy Doran and I found ourselves crawling around on the floor once again, cutting away with X-acto knives the worst of the tattered parts of the pattern, cleaning the accumulated grunge underneath with varsol, and patching the gap with fresh tape. As we inched along, we speculated on how much time we'd put into labyrinth maintenance altogether over the years. \"Do you think it's been a thousand hours?\" I asked. Bob Snider, our church caretaker, happened by at that moment. \"Oh, easily,\" he exclaimed. Paddy and I stared at him and then thought about what that meant. Much as we both enjoy the camaraderie of working together and the craftsmanship involved in the laying out of arcs and lines, the activity was definitely taking more of a toll physically than it used to. Our knees were stiff and our backs hurt. The tape was cheap and easy to use, and it looked great the first few days after a repair, but St. Paul's parish hall is a very active place. The tape was easily snagged by shoes and chairs, and hard to keep free of crumbs and spills and Sunday School craft glue, glitter, and sticky bits. Meanwhile, our labyrinth was becoming famous! In the Globe & Mail series on spirituality' last Christmas, Ethics & Religion columnist Michael Valpy had described walking with us, and included a big photo of Paddy in the centre of the labyrinth holding a shepherd's crook (looking a little as if all us naughty lambs had disappeared while his back was turned). According to Kate, our church secretary, people were calling every day from as far away as Alberta and Nova Scotia, mentioning that article and asking about how to find us and when we were open. Helen Post Curry, president 'S4 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/spirit/ 168 of The Labyrinth Society (of which we are a member), had included St. Paul's in the labyrinth locator section of her new book, The Way of the Labyrinth: A Powerful Meditation for Everyday Life. People were calling because of that, as well as the website locator listing with Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, where Paddy and I both trained with Rev. Dr. Lauren Artress in labyrinth practice and facilitation. Maybe the hundreds of hours on the floor might be better spent responding to those people, or the ones in our own community, the theatre groups and bereavement support groups and meditation groups that already have been through St. Paul's labyrinth. We wondered if maybe we'd be more useful planning follow-up workshops for the youth prayer retreat, or investigating what the other labyrinth facilitators were doing across Canada (our friends Anne Tanner and Camilla Grymska at Holy Trinity in the Toronto Labyrinth Network, Justine Giuliani at the Central Park Labyrinth in Burlington, Judy Ganes in Beaverton, April Stanley out in West Vancouver, and many others). Maybe it was time to re-think what we were doing. So in May this year the first gathering of the St. Paul's Labyrinth Committee took place, with the intention of deciding whether or not to undertake building a permanent labyrinth. We learned about permanent and temporary labyrinths, and what the advantages and disadvantages are of each kind. Many churches and institutions have canvas labyrinths (very handsome and durable ones can be bought from Grace Cathedral etc. for about $5000 Cdn) that are brought out of storage for special events. They can be moved around to other parishes and locations, rented out, used outdoors, etc. The main feature of these temporary or portable labyrinths is that access to them takes place during specific events and is controlled by the organizers. You can't just wander in and walk on it any time you want. But the committee saw this as a disadvantage because it was exclusionary, keeping people out rather than inviting them in, and not in keeping with the spirit of St. Paul's. For a while at the beginning we had used Loni Granville's cloth labyrinth, but we preferred the feeling of solidity and the look of architectural permanence that even a taped one has. We agreed that it was a useful experiment and preliminary introduction, but that we were past that stage. About the tape and painted labyrinths we have had, we observed that the design is beautiful and transforms the hall, especially at night with candles; that it says something definite about our parish, congregation, and building; that it is an entryway that visitors gravitate towards immediately. We decided that for us it is a form of evangelism and a community service to different groups (e.g. the mental health patients, the drama class, the McMaster students, the parents and tots group). As far as we could tell, the congregation has generally been positive. If it weren't there, we realize we would miss it! We saw that we were at a crossroads about our commitment as a congregation to the labyrinth as one of the visible signs of what we stand for as a parish. 169 We began to identify the steps involved to install a permanent labyrinth. First thing was a list of criteria and standards for the final product such as quality of finish, ease of maintenance, accessibility, requirements of groups using the hall (e.g. the folk dancers, the babies, the orchestra). We needed information about the options in materials and processes available for building, quotes, and timeline for installation. During the discussion about financing, we sadly discarded fantasies about marble inlay and matching marble walls! The possibility of making a proposal to community funding organisations came up: to include evidence of present use we would need documentation of what we've already done. We would need to show plans for outreach in the community, possibly partnering with mental health and life transitions support organisations, providers of mediation services, the university community, medical institutions, and others. We needed a mission statement! (\"One you can say at gunpoint!\"') Over the summer, the committee met to share information and plan our next move. We had hoped to find closer to home an alternative to the fabulously beautiful (and fabulously costly \u2014 $50,000!) linoleum tile inlay version we had seen on-line through an American firm. But the field is so new that local contractors just shook their heads. A representative from the Trillium Foundation kindly came and talked with us about the proposal process. It would be long and complicated, but very thorough, requiring of us that we have a clear idea of our program intentions for the next five years. What did we want to do? How could our labyrinth best serve the community? Where in our parish life did it fit? Answering these questions was a good goal to aim for over the coming year, which we could move towards slowly and thoughtfully. We asked for and received Parish Council's approval to begin researching such a possibility. At our July meeting, we consolidated our thoughts in a memo of intent for our labyrinth, that it would be used as \"a tool for meditation/worship; outreach to those not part of the church community; research into spiritual development and health issues; education/resource for the above for others interested in labyrinth programs,\" with the tentative goal of a plan for a program by Easter 2002 and implementation possibly by September 2002. This stated intent will help us to approach potential community and institutional partners. I'll have more on that in the coming months. But in the meantime, August was approaching. There would be a two week window to strip the floors, and we had to move quickly if we wanted to replace the labyrinth during that time. On-line research yielded some suggestions about painting the pattern onto linoleum. It's much more advisable to paint onto wood or concrete than onto 50 year old wax-soaked linoleum, but we did what we could with the less than ideal conditions. Paddy and Bob put in an heroic effort to get the floor surface stripped down enough to take the first coat of primer, and then gangs of volunteers showed up to craw] for 170 hours round and round on the floor, helping to lay out the pattern with sticks and string and calculators (and kettle drum lids and pie plates for the petals and lunations), twist their brains round the geometry, mask in the pattern with tape, then lay down the coats of paint, and sing, have picnics, drink coffee, tell jokes and stories, make mistakes, make amends, get to know each other, get in the way, have fun, and altogether, little by little, create the beautiful community artwork that is the labyrinth at St. Paul's. In fact, it was so much fun, with so many individuals coming out to help and share the work and the puzzling over the design details, that I have to wonder whether doing all of that isn't just as important a part of the labyrinth's place in the community as are the times when we walk serenely through it together with candlelight and flowers and music in the regularly scheduled Third Thursday and Musical Sunday night events. Although, I've been going in circles so long, I can't tell anymore. You'll have to let me know! Vanessa Compton, November, 2001 171 Rev. Paddy Doran's sermon on Luke 13: 10-15 bent over and quite unable to stand straight. This story gives us a glimpse into Jesus' model for healing. He says first, \"Woman, you are set free from your ailment.\" and later, when the Rabbi upbraids the crowd for coming on the Sabbath to be healed, Jesus likens the healing to untying your donkey so he can drink, and says, \"Ought not this woman be set free?\" Healing for Jesus was a matter of untying a knot. Jen healed a woman who had a spirit that crippled her for 18 years. She was The image of the woman bent over for 18 years evoked a strong response from several people I talked to this week. It seems most of us are caught by that image perhaps because most of us have an experience of being bent over inside, somewhere. But we are sophisticated modern people and we think it quaint that Jesus would talk about the woman bent over as being bound by Satan instead of crippled by osteoporosis. In our vast ignorance we have a quiet pride that we know what ails us and others. Perhaps the ailments we suffer are a series of knots that we have been twisted into or have twisted ourselves into. I have wondered if the forgiveness of sins isn't what the sick really want to know, and that that would unravel the grip of disease. But my model is hazy and confused by the medical model that I carry around. Maybe we do need to claim the healing inherent in coming forward to receive the Eucharist after being assured that the sins we can acknowledge, are forgiven. All I know is that Jesus' model affected a cure and mine (ours) so often doesn't. Jesus is someone with great clarity. When rabbis quote the Scripture to oppose him, Jesus does not flinch or be overwhelmed, he stays with his vision and remembers who he is and whose he is and the entire crowd is amazed and rejoices. For the past two weeks this parish has been engaged in a kind of alternate form of healing, we have renewed our walking prayer path, our labyrinth. Over the past four years we have experienced the power of using this ancient design that the monks laid in the floor of Chartres Cathedral as a healing circle. We aren't clear how this complex yet simple pattern can help bring healing but we know it does. Maybe its effect comes from untying the complex knots that bind us as we walk its circuits. But every year the rough use of the floor in our hall necessitates that the design be patched and eventually totally re-done. This has necessitated many hours of kneeling around this circles culminating in totally re-drawing it. This year we have even researched getting a grant from lottery proceeds, the Trillium Foundation, to retile the floor with this pattern cut into the design. In considering this application we have been faced with questions about how committed we are to provide the labyrinth walk as a priority in our parish life. How available are we prepared to make this path? As we obliterated our tape design in order to strip and refinish the floor we wondered if there was a will within our community to replace it again, Knowing it would not last long. I found myself working late into the night and make decisions 172 like, \"Will I visit the sick or help facilitate replacing our walking meditation?\" Of course I tried to do both but the vision of providing this resource to the unknown people who will come to explore their inner journey remained with me through stripping, scribing, taping, painting, sealing and waxing. As the work progressed the community responded. We have images of people sprawled over the design, scribing it, taping and puzzling over how to do it best and marvelling at its intricacies. Please come down and see the results of our labours after the service. For myself, the lunations, those spikey points around the edge leapt out at me this time, perhaps because they are painted in more boldly. They may be part of a calendar or part of a sign of protection but this time for me they were also dancing tongues of fire. For the labyrinth is meant to be a safe place to explore and as a facilitator one of my main intents is to provide the safe place that will not be disturbed while participants make their journey. For me the lunations guard the participants with tongues of fire, like a sign of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Yes, we may be shaken but as the letter to the Hebrews says, \"We are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us give thanks, by which we offer an acceptable worship with reverence and awe for indeed our God is a consuming fire.\" Within this labyrinth-firewall women + men work at loosening the knot of their existence and some who have been bent over for 18 years are set free to stand up straight and begin praising God. Let us rejoice and be glad in it. Amen The Reverend Canon Patrick G. Doran, St Paul's Westdale, August 26, 2001 173 Ritual Whenever the human being has found the slightest shelter... we shall see the imagination build \"walls\" of impalpable shadows, comfort itself with the illusion of protection. (Bachelard 1994, pg.5) Once we had the labyrinth installed, the challenge was to be intentional about the space so that the heightened atmosphere would convey a sense of the labyrinth as an art object/ritual technology/sacred place. Over time we discovered that this meant: inviting people by posting and distributing flyers and announcements throughout the neighbourhood, diocese, and mailing lists; clearing the floor, the air, and the schedule; adjusting the lighting, cleaning the candleholders and setting out the candles, arranging the centre, and sometimes decorating the walls for the great festivals and saints' days; deciding on the music, setting up the portable CD player (or, with any luck, the singers and musicians); setting up the table and chairs for the reception area, greeting visitors, welcoming newcomers, helping everyone get settled; going over the basic etiquette for labyrinth proxemics''\u00ae and how things would proceed liturgically; teaching movement, gesture, pace, breathing, body prayer, and attentiveness; then, when, marking off when sacred time would \"begin\"; one of us inviting participants one by one to the entrance of the labyrinth, and all of us meditating, individually and together; until all had gone through; then sitting quietly afterwards, before blowing out the candles and putting the room back for daily use. Each of these actions can be seen as part of the technology that supports sacred, transformative space. The cues for creating such a sacred spatial environment, besides the interpersonal behaviours of calm demeanour (or the least frantic possible), welcoming \u00b0\u00b0 noun: the study of spatial distances between individuals in different cultures and situations. The term was introduced by anthropologist Edward Hall in 1963, who found that that social distance between people is reliably correlated with physical distance, and described four distances: intimate distance for embracing, touching or whispering (15-45 cm, 6-18 inches); personal distance for interactions among good friends (45-120 cm, 1.5-4 feet); social distance for interactions among acquaintances (1.2-3.5 m, 4-12 ft); public distance used for public speaking (over 3.5 m, 12 ft). The labyrinth forces people into intimate or personal distance when passing, and this needs to be negotiated and strategised beforehand. It is always mentioned, by a facilitator at a guided walk, or in brochures available at the site. Related issues are whether or not to make eye contact, and how to pass someone moving more slowly than you are comfortable with. Each of these situations acts as mirrors because the labyrinth makes everything transparent. 174 attitudes and gestures of invitation, are material and multi-sensorial, visual, tactile, auditory and olfactory. Each of these sense dimensions have their own specifics, although some overlap, and different stimuli trigger responses from varying depths of memory and feeling. Visually we concentrated on minimising clutter and softening the lighting at a general level, and the creation of small altars at focal points, in the centre and the side opposite the entrance, places to gather and rest and silently share. Turner describes the creation of small personal altars (in the domestic realm, but the principle is relevant here) as arising from \"a reverence for shared images and symbols...ritual accoutrements formulating what Gimbutas calls a 'language of the goddess... a language for abstract ideas' ...based on representation and analogy,\" with the emphasis on establishing and renewing the relationship between self and Other at \"a threshold of contact with another dimension that is there all the time\" (1999, pp. 13, 28). The altar/resting place points to the influence of the archetype represented by the goddess Hestia,'* both the tradition of honouring \"the holiness of the ordinary,\" the divine close to home (Downing in Turner, 1999, p.15) and through the practice of meditation and its effect of quiet well-being, a subjective practice of the self which evokes the introverted, inwardly focused goddess (Bolen, 1984, p. 31). These altars always had arrangements of flowers or plants, sometimes bowls of stones, or sand with candles and incense set in it. The simplest arrangement could provoke the most profound response: for a Lenten walk, an austere time in the liturgical year, the centre of the labyrinth held a large, sprawling and prickly cactus in an earthenware bowl, with white votive candles at the four corners. Afterwards one participant commented that the cactus reminded her how little sustenance the soul actually requires and still thrive. But the cactus was unusual: generally the altars featured appealing textures and abundance, bouquets of fragrant roses and sweet peas set on silk and basketwork mats. The centre was always, curiously, a surprise to come upon, and a pleasure to be in: a frequent comment was that it was a difficult place to leave, people wanted to rest there, maybe forever. It was, as intended, a safe place for that form of meditation which \"... is not a diversion, it is the willingness to be with what is. Often ... 'what is' is the painful revelation of (Housden 1995, p.19). \u00b0\u00b0 Root word ousia: essential being, reality 175 The auditory environment is a sensitive area for personal associations and triggers. Most effective for a heightened sense of participation and connectivity for us was to sing Taiz\u00e9 together, if there were some lead singers in the group to keep the pace. The music was familiar through a regular monthly Taiz\u00e9 service at the church so the overlap was natural. The principles of the Taiz\u00e9 order were compatible also: simplicity in worship and prayerful reconciliation between all people. The ecumenical ministry of the Community of Reconciliation at Taiz\u00e9 in Burgundy focuses on a contemplative form of public worship, \"corporate quiet\" alternating with reflective singing. These songs, the \"music of Taiz\u00e9,\" composed by Jacques Berthier,'*' are both appealing and timeless, easily learned and harmonised, by non-musicians or a choir, accompanied or sung a cappela. Translated into many languages, they provide a vehicle for diversity and communion to the international youth pilgrimages to the Community that number tens of thousands of individuals every year. The songs usually consist of several short devotional phrases or lines from the psalms sung over and over again, the idea being that the words sink into the subconscious and become a form of prayer. They have no beginning or ending and are easy to open up to movements of the Spirit. Many people have said that they first learned to pray at a Taiz\u00e9 service. At the weeklong residential sessions at Taiz\u00e9, people report that there little fragments of humming all around. The Taiz\u00e9 Community, whose mission is to work and pray for reconciliation among all people, describe the music as a form of meditation, functioning communally: \"meditative singing thus becomes a way of listening to God. It allows everyone to take part in a time of prayer together and to remain together in attentive waiting on God,\" and individually: \" These songs also sustain personal prayer. They can continue in the silence of our hearts when we are at work, speaking with others or resting. In this way prayer and daily life are united.'?** \u00b0\u00b0' The French composer, (1923-1994), born at Auxerres to musician parents, studied composition at the C\u00e9sar Franck School. He was commissioned in 1955 and again in 1975 to compose chants for specific texts and guidelines provided by the Community. His gift was to accommodate the music to the accents of the many languages in which the texts would be sung. His other major compositional style used Gregorian modes. In the early years, the brothers of the Community used 16th century settings of the Psalms, and music by the Jesuit Joseph G\u00e9lineau, a teacher of Berthier. .http://www.giamusic.com/artists/Berthier-Jacques.cfm. \u00b0* http://www.taize.ft/en_article338.html. For a parish-based introduction, see http://www.cofeguildford.org.uk/html/resources/taize%20worship.pdf 176 In the following account, Taiz\u00e9 music was a vehicle for conveying the image that helped the writer, a woman in her forties returning to school as a divinity student, come to terms with her resistance to difference. She articulates with fine-grained detail her inter- and intrapersonal sensitivities and awareness of self and other, and has, conscientiously I think, used the labyrinth experience as a Vygotskyan scaffolding to make, first, an aesthetic bridge, then a compassionate one, and finally, a theological pass across the obstacles remaining from family history: June 18th, 1998 Dear Vanessa: this is a labyrinth letter for you. First, about Good Friday: it was the first time I'd walked the labyrinth. I have a bad left ankle, and bad balance, so for the first few curves I focussed on being grounded and deliberate \u2014 one step at a time and the foot flat and not wobbly before lifting the other foot. Very important not to feel wobbly in meditation and prayer. Second, the thing I noticed was the turns. (\"To everything, turn, turn, turn...\"). Like the prodigal son's brother, I can be very judgmental, and things like people coughing while I'm trying to meditate, make me crazy. So I started asking for help to leave things behind as I made those tight turns \u2014 opinions of others, snotty remarks to myself about myself, other bad behaviour on my part. It made it very hard to turn some of the corners \u2014 it's hard to give up your bad stuff, even \u2014 same as what will I do if I don't smoke? The other thing I asked to leave behind was the big clock on the wall \u2014 the busy part of me (I'm a 2 on the Enneagram) doesn't like to waste time playing or introspecting \u2014 there's always something real to do. So I'd sneak peeks until I convinced myself (temporarily) that I did not need to know how long it was taking, or how far to the centre, and I left them behind as I turned. How far to the centre? I was fascinated by going almost straight to the centre from the mouth; the long passage around the rim just before you get to the centre. You're furthest from the centre just before you reach it, and closest as the crow flies, when you're furthest on the walk. The edge is the centre, and vice versa. The beginning and end are the same. Jesus is the alpha and omega. When life is tumultuous and God seems far away, that's the time when God is right there \u2014 the footprints in the sand story. All is one, and Jesus is at the centre, and is the rim and is the path; and all of this is true, and none of it is possible, and I don't need to know how or why; I only need to leave the desire to know behind when I make the turns. 177 This is all getting very stream-of-consciousness, which is good for me and I hope you follow parts of it. 'Cause now we're on to tonight. First of all, people like Noreen, and to a lesser extent, Vera [two dancers in the Gabrielle Roth mode, visiting that evening. All names have been changed] petrify me. Not Anglican, you know? If you grew up in a very dysfunctional family (alcoholics everywhere!) you have to hide all the time, because if they find out anything, they turn it into a weapon \u2014 that's my response anyway. So I've stayed very good, and contained, and I'm scared by people who aren't. Anyway, it was clear to me that it was not going to be quiet and restrained tonight, so I started feeling cranky. Then I tried leaving that behind at the turns, and it helped. Tonight was not going to be the same \u2014 and I started seeing the dance, that we all created in the labyrinth. The dance was creation, and it was all of us together that made it. So I enjoyed the danceness of it. The singing helped too \u2014 [had been practicing being Mahalia at my singing lesson earlier. The kinds of risky creating I'm not free enough for with my body I could do with the singing. Anyway it was during Maranatha that I started flying. I was into the centre and out again by the time we started Jubilate Deo, and sitting on the carpet (that's my very favorite Taiz\u00e9 prayer). When I was in the centre, standing, eyes closed, I could identify particular voices as they kept moving through the labyrinth \u2014 around & behind & in front of me of me; very otherworldly. So I sat on the mat, and sang, and watched people's feet as they danced the labyrinth, and got caught up in the singing of Jubilate Deo. That one swoops around, especially with the round-singing, and I love it. | was thinking of Jesus anyway, then cradling the infant Jesus in my arms and singing the Jubilate as a lullaby; and knowing his future; and wanting to protect him; and can't; and then cradling the broken body from the cross, with the infant's face at the same time; and the Spirit present through all that music of the spheres we made. I was ticked off at Paddy \u2014 I wanted either to keep singing Jubilate forever, or to just stop and us all leave. And also thinking about \"how beautiful are the feet of him that bringest glad tidings\" as I watched people go past (which was really before the baby part). Then at the end, I sat cross legged with my hands palm-up on my knees, and waited for Jesus. I could feel great heaviness in the palms of my hands, which seemed related to nails. I don't think I'd have been surprised to find stigmata. At the end Kristin came and sat with me with her arm around me \u2014 somehow just what I'd been hoping for. And we talked a little about scary not- Anglicans. Bart [the music director at St. Paul's at the time, a jazz pianist] has 178 helped me learn to deal with that. If all his music is prayer, as he says, then it is all about God somehow, and if it is hard music for me, I try to see how it shows an aspect of God. So Noreen must show me an aspect of God, if I look the right way. I think this is the end \u2014 it's 11:52 and there is Beethoven on the radio, and I'm exhausted. Anyway, today was very Pentecostal for me \u2014 all that speaking in tongues, and I'm very grateful that you did all that work, so I could have visions. With lots of love from K. The routine of setting up the space and performing the rituals month after month was intended to make the labyrinth a safe and reliable place that existed, whether or not participants actually made it to the hall each time. Another report of a different event, from a chaplain working in a hospital setting, made clear the importance of this continuity as a model for problem-solving by demonstrating the reliability of grounded experience as a an incubator for creativity and intuition: This past June I came to St. Paul's with my friend Sylvia to walk the labyrinth. It had been my first opportunity to \"try out\" this spiritual tool. There were more people than I was expecting and we were invited to take off shoes and socks, relax, breathe and walk. As I walked amidst the others and the Taiz\u00e9 music and singing feeling my bare feet, step by step take me forward, I tried hard to focus on one question or thought. Life was so hectic and tenuous then it was difficult but finally one came to me and I let it roll over and over in my mind. I was still trying very hard to keep focused on this question as I reached the centre. It was an uncomfortable space right at that time and I did not stay there long. I was dealing with the question intellectually and I suppose I was awaiting a similar response. Like, now I have the question and snap - soon I would \"have\" the answer. I was on the exit leg of my walk as I was concluding that it just didn't work. Perhaps I was too uptight or too tired. Tonight I'm just not on the right wave length, I thought. I was at least half way out when I became aware of a different feeling in my body. A comfort and relaxation that I had not brought in to the experience with me; a content, safe and gentle feeling. It felt good and I realized that my intellectual searching almost missed the answer to the question. It had not come intellectually at all but 179 rather washed over me in such completeness as to fully affect the way I was feeling in my own skin at that moment. It was overwhelming in the clarity and intensity. My life has again been in great transition and remembering that walk and the answer to my question leads me to yearn to walk the labyrinth again. In September I took up my ministry as Chaplain at [Institution X]. Within the next month we are to have installed here a carpet Labyrinth. I can hardly wait to walk it. Thank you for your ministry. The labyrinth provides a designated space for the body and mind to work through their joint process of percept collection, image-making, and construction and discernment of meaning. This account, by a painter and ecological educator after a day-long workshop during which we made the Chartres labyrinth together with tape, shows clearly how individuals become attuned to their gestures, real and conceptual environments, and habits of mind and of embodiment as \"texts\" to be woven together. The binaries of labyrinth experience, the overview and the welter, are clearly visible in this report. My walk began with setting an intention, a focus, a strand or stream on which to hang my experience. I picked marriage as the focus. By marriage I mean the joining of complements in the broadest sense. I wanted to open to my marriage with my husband, the marriage of my masculine and feminine aspects, the marriage of my body and mind, the marriage of my being with the earth. I started my walk with a sense of anxiety my husband and I have been experiencing a great deal of conflict lately and for the first time in our 13 year relationship I was entertaining thoughts about how life might be without him. I was separate from my marriage, an outsider looking in. At the beginning of the walk my body felt wired and fatigued after a day of no exercise and lots of standing and less than ideal food. My first dozen or so steps were quick agitated even. I felt wobbly in the turns, squeezed into the tight 14\" space each pathway allowed. I needed to look down at my feet to see that they were staying in the lines. At this point I decided to approach my walk as though it was a walking meditation. So I slowed my steps down enough that they were quite in synch with the slow meditative rhythm of my inhale and exhale. At first this change in rhythm made me feel panicky, my rate of progress was so slow through the inordinately large number of turns and pathways that lay ahead of me. But I had done walking meditation before so I was able to call my focus back to my breath and stay with the slow mindful stepping while 180 observing my mind's tendency to race ahead. I continued in this manner almost all the way to the center of the labyrinth. When I arrived at the center I had the feeling that I had arrived home. My impulse was to do the yoga posture entitled \"pose of a child\". I needed to be close to the ground and this pose with its curled up nature suited that feeling very well. In part I wanted to bow to the light of the candle placed in the center. I also felt the need to relax and stretch my body while I was in the center. I needed to stretch out the kinks that seemed to be yelling more loudly now. So I stretched out my legs and arms using various postures and also stayed in pose of a child for what seemed like a long time. After about 10 minutes of stretching and holding, I decided to begin my walk back. On this walk I noticed that I was no longer looking at my feet. Instead I was able to both look ahead and keep my balance while I moved. I experienced a sense of freedom and possibility when I reached the long open expanses of some sections of path and I was able to relax into the back and forth rhythm of the short zig-zag patterns as well. Turns posed no problem as I seemed better able to anticipate them and move my body through them smoothly. I felt clearer, less weighted down and more alive. My original intention of \"marriage\" seemed like a distant anxious worry while I engrossed my self in a special tingling I experienced in my hands. Then suddenly in a totally unexpected and almost shocking manner I found myself on the threshold of the last turn that led directly to the exit. I had to pause here and gather myself. I had to get a handle on the horror I felt at some level that I was not able to continue indefinitely. I had to gather my courage to let go and finish. Even though I knew that I had been moving towards the exit, its presence startled me when I arrived there. I was very sad that it had all come to an end so soon. In hindsight, I felt a connection to myself, my body, my husband, to all beings and to spirit while I walked the labyrinth that was enlivening and much like a homecoming. I felt like I had experienced both the in-the- moment sensation and overview of my small speck of existence. The pattern of a life lived became clearer for me as I zig-zagged, slowed down, wanted to fly and was made to finish. This was a wonderful experience. This is the purpose of communions like church and ritual undertakings like pilgrimages, which go on in faith even when the individual members of congregations, social movements, and pilgrim routes have doubt, holding the structure together for you until you are ready to return. For one of the regular participants at the monthly events at St. Paul's, a graphic 181 designer who came from some distance away in all kinds of weather, the epiphanic insight was that, analogous to the centre of the labyrinth, \"the Centre is always inside you.\" For that individual, the labyrinth was a place to have what he called \"phone calls with God,\" a description which suggests both that \"portable space\" necessary for creativity, and a relationship which is both reliable and unconditional.''\" As we saw in the \"homecoming\" in the last account, it evokes the Ideal of \"home\" \u2014 that place where, Robert Frost said, \"when you have to go there, they have to take you in\" \u2014 or, for many people, the place that you may have to reconstruct for yourself. The next section, \"Coal @ Christmas\" examines this idea. 3\u00b0 \u00abWell, Well, Well,\" an old spiritual also known as \"Jesus gonna to make up my dying bed,\" recorded by R.H. Harris and the Soul Stirrers in 1947, contains these great lines Since I been married to Jesus, we never been a minute apart! I got a telephone in my bosom, child, and I can ring him up in my heart... Well, well, well, let's ring up Jesus, Well, well, well, let's ring up Jesus, Well, well, well, let's ring up Jesus, Jesus gonna make up my dyin' bed. Track 7 on All of My Appointed Time - Forty Years of Acappella Gospel. Jass Records. Jass J CD 640 (1996); reissued on Mojo 308 182 Coal @ Christmas: Some observations on the journey home It was a cold December night, the eve of the solstice, not long until Christmas. About fifteen people had shown up for the regular third Thursday guided labyrinth walk, including one woman who'd called earlier in the week to say she was coming down by bus from Toronto and planned to stay over at a bed & breakfast and make a real pilgrimage of it. Knowing this dignified the feeling of enthusiasm and anticipation in the atmosphere and helped bring together as a group the little clusters of friends arriving from all over. None were from the congregation except Paddy the minister and myself: the less traditional services and events tend to draw people in who otherwise would be unlikely to come to church. If we were keepers of a pilgrimage site for these seekers, then all the more significance lay in our usual scrambling to get ready. Thad arrived early to sweep up the Sunday school crumbs and wash the surface of the labyrinth in the waning light of late afternoon. I love doing this. The elegance of the pattern glows through the trodden-on bits of plasticine, \"Good work!\" stickers, spilt juice, scraps of wool and chalk and discarded song sheets, the detritus of a busy parish life. Like a mother, like the Earth, the labyrinth underlies all this activity and embraces it. | always feel honoured to be washing Her beautiful face, and through these mundane tasks, helping to prepare for the stunning transformation of our collective perception of sacred space later in the evening when Paddy gathered us in prayer to begin the service. I set out the flowers: a sparkly red poinsettia by the entrance on the information table, which I have draped with a brightly embroidered fringed black silk shawl; a sprawling arrangement of motley red and pink and white carnations and pine branches at the center of the labyrinth; a bow] of prickly, glossy deep green holly with bright scarlet berries at the far side of the labyrinth; each with clusters of votive candles around them like little altars. When people arrived, we asked them to help set out dozens more candles in the lunations round the outer edge of the labyrinth, in the window ledges, in the doorways. One woman sensibly suggested a tray, and we said, \"What a good idea! But this way, it's a group activity!\" Paddy expanded on this theme in the introduction, how we have learned over the years of keeping the labyrinth that this is public sacred art in which all may participate and engage, contribute and receive. To walk it is, he said, to practice body prayer within ancient Anglican tradition, a meditation that embodies the intention of shedding, journeying, turning as repentance. Everyone listened attentively. They took off their shoes and sat quietly as Paddy chanted in plainsong, Deo gratia. I turned down the hall lights and turned up the recording of harp and chant fusion music that we use as accompaniment. The light through the stained glass windows of the church across the courtyard glowed into the hall. The candles flickered in the dusk, outlining the huge circle of the labyrinth. I moved to the labyrinth entrance and opened 183 my hands in invitation. One by one each person came and stood before me. We bowed to one another. I smiled in welcome, hugging those I knew if they reached out. I looked into each face, trying to bring to awareness what that person might be needing then, as I gestured them towards the opening. Each one stepped resolutely forward. As they moved deeper into the circuits, stiff posture and gait resisted and then relaxed, hunched shoulders dropped, shallow breathing changed to sighs. When everyone had entered, I walked slowly around the perimeter to \"wind up\" the energy they are building within, and then settled down on the far axis by the holly altar to a sitting meditation where I watched over the people moving along the path and prayed for their wellbeing. On the far side, Paddy was doing the same. Participants have told us that our doing this helps them feel safe. I attended to each one, observing the way their burdens and dilemmas, sorrows and joys were expressed in their walking. I was glad to see Madeleine, a regular participant at the labyrinth events. A heavy woman with a corona of silver hair and a big open face with intense eyes, she is graceful on her feet and her smile lights up a room. But she is not always smiling: often her expression is determined and sometimes she marches into the labyrinth as if to battle. Madeleine says that she does \"lots of work\" on these walks, and when she shows up, I put out a second box of tissues at the far side of the labyrinth where it is easily reached. She finds the mudras I sometimes demonstrate\u2014 gestures of prayer and meditation from all over the world\u2014 helpful for this work, particularly those of \"shedding\" and purgation: one for self hugging that becomes a brushing off of old skin or moulting feathers, and a Balinese hand and wrist extension that models an extreme \"letting go\" where you keep nothing back in your cupped hand. That night Madeleine had much to attend to\u2014she was the first one up. She looked festive in colourful flowing clothes and lots of big shiny necklaces, and her toenails were painted sparkly pink! Her eyes were bright as she greeted me at the entrance, then leaned over, grabbed a wad of tissues, and launched herself onto the path like a swan into a river. Throughout the evening she was mercurial, a storyline seeming to unfold in her moods as she first embraced herself, then brushed away something that looked as if it might be sticky and awful, then breathing deeply and shuddering, shook a burden from her shoulders, before making her way to the center where she sat quietly for a very long time staring into the carnations and candlelight, crying softly to herself and wiping her eyes. Finally she got to her feet, turned to look back at the center, and started back out along the path. This time, she danced round the turns, occasionally beaming her big smile, and when she reached the holly altar, serenely knelt down beside it and tenderly stroked its shining leaves. As I sat on the other side of the bowl in deep meditation, even with my eyes closed I could feel the waves of energy coming from her. I looked up and met her glance. She looked beatific. 184 Afterwards Madeleine wanted to talk. \"I left a load of coal in that fourth petal tonight,\" she announced cheerfully. \"Oh really? What was going on?\" I asked. \"My mother died this year. We didn't get along at all. I've had a lot to work through. I told my sister, 'You know, this will be the first Christmas dinner in our whole lives that we can put the potatoes on the left side of the plate, and not get told off for being so yo wrong', \" she said, her eyes flashing. I nodded in sympathy. There was coal in my Christmas story as well. Early January \u2014is there a phrase more bleakly evocative? Bachelard says that \"winter is by far the oldest of the seasons...conferring age upon our memories, taking us back to a remote past\" and that \"a reminder of winter strengthens the happiness of a place to live in.\" ( p. 40) Cleaning my desk, I swept up a torn scrap of pine green tissue paper, leftover from this year's Christmas card production, a bleak collage of mauve foil sky, mountain range of green tissue, in the foreground bright green foil pine forest cut out silhouettes over streaks of tan and black representing a northern sort of desert, and, way overhead right off the collage and on the white card backing, a shiny gummed star. (The appropriate music would be the Huron Carol \"...'Twas in the moon of wintertime...\") It is an image of the search for the Desired Object, distant and intangible, in the form of a hard cold light beyond the known but thickly impenetrable and multiply-layered material world. Portrait of the artist-celebrant on the verge of a vision quest or a wild goose chase, perhaps. Maybe it is a map to a birthplace, for an exile. Or directions to a rebirth. \"It's beautiful,\" observed a perennial recipient on the Christmas card list, \"but what happened this year? You always do a potato print at Christmas!\" It's true, they usually represent something tangible: three bright orange tangerines, printed on water 185 colour paper, the rough surface perfectly translating the fruit's dimpled surface; or a vine wreath, black, austere and thorny in the sharply gouged surface of the potato medium, redeemed by the bright red bow painted in after; or a Christmas tree, plaid and scribbly-minimalist. This year was different. A long, difficult relationship with my troubled mother was coming to an end. The final discouragement was to listen while, having been diagnosed with cancer, she reviewed her life. She had spent much time in the abyss, she said, but architecture, opera, and literature had made life worth living. All spectator activities, I noticed. No mention of family connections, children or grandchildren; no students or clients whose lives she no doubt touched, no clubs or congregations or causes, no contributions to the world, no friendships, not even her garden were on the list. No insights, no triumphs, no rebirths. No Christmases. This pronouncement was followed by a greeting card with instructions not to visit during the holidays, as our relations were \"inharmonious.\" There was no pleasing her. It was unmistakeably the sign to move on. Moving on. The journey is a common image for the passage through a human life. Sometimes this movement is conceived as running swiftly towards a final goal, as in the term curriculum, or the biblical imprimatur at funerals that the deceased has indeed run the good race. This linear progression towards a fixed point informs the developmental view of childhood and maturation, whereby \"a universal human Truth can be uncovered and applied to all...that would ultimately reveal...our destination in life\" (Cannella, 1983, p. 47), with any tangential movement quickly identified as a possible deviance and cause for concern and correction. It is a fundamental sort of geometry: a single point has no dimension, but two points allows for a line and therefore movement. Three points, however, delineate a plane, and provide the ground for a generative potentiality that is considered deeply spiritual in contemplative geometry. Out of the triangle can be constructed forms of much dimensional complexity. At the very least, it can be seen metaphorically as a model of co-existent alternate perspectives, two (or more) trajectories of thought originating from each point. In this sense, the linearity of journey epitomised by the layout of twists and turns in the unicursal labyrinth path begins to address the \"dual need\" Otto Rank identified \"for differentiation and likeness, for individuality and connection\" expressed in a \"reaching out for something bigger...[which] originates in the individual's need for expansion beyond the realm of his self... for some kind of 'beyond'...to which he can submit.\" In Rank's view, nothing in reality, no human individual or institution, \"can carry the weight of this expansion,\" and the task of psychological individuation is \"to realize that there exists a difference between one's spiritual and one's purely human needs, that the satisfaction or fulfillment for each has to be found in different spheres\" (Rank in Downing, 1988, p. 135). 186 Downing and Rank are concerned with pathologies arising from unconscious efforts to avoid the trials of individuation. But the distinction between the spiritual and the purely human presents a challenge to the project of restoring the spiritual dimension of everyday life: what does it mean \"to expand beyond the realm of self\"? Is this yet another constructed and oppositional binary? Can we not inhabit both spheres at once, or at least, stay aware of the tension between them? What would provide a kind of landmark in the sea of multiple potentialities is a language that moves between the two (only two? more like 7) dimensions. Imagery and metaphor provide the quickest route to such a common ground. Then we can begin to address the dual need itself, for individuality and connection, solitude and belonging. So, working with the two images presented here, the journey and the load of coal, we can interrogate the stories. To journey is to journey somewhere, one assumes. The bleak dark landscape of the Christmas card represents the scene in the Nativity story when the birth of the Christ child is marked by the appearance of the mysterious Star, always capitalised in Christian texts. The next scene would be the Adoration, where all the animals and shepherds and exotic Wise Men, having been guided by the Star to Bethlehem, would be depicted kneeling before the Baby who sits safely in his mother's arms, bathed in a glow of warm celestial light (as distinct from starlight, which is cool and distant). As we enter the space of the Star picture, we carry in our minds the hope of finding this warm, intimate scene. We know that Mary is gracious and the Baby is here to save us, so we can conflate the goal of the journeying with the likelihood of being included in this ideal family moment. Our desire to be so received provides the impetus to make the long hard journey through a darkness filled with our own personal manifestations of Herod's soldiers and Roman legions, guided only by the cold and distant Star, itself an image of the remote Father. The goal of this journey is to reach that place where hope can be restored for an earthly existence defined by more than the Herods and Roman legionnaires of the world. Ideally, this place would be \"Home.\" What can we say about such a place? In representations of the Nativity, rough though the stable is, the cows and sheep seem benign, the straw is clean, there is light, and the roof is not leaking. It is comfortable enough. In his history of the concept of \"Home,\" Rybczynski, introduces the idea of comfort as \"domestic well-being, a fundamental human need that is deeply rooted in us, and that must be satisfied\" and includes \"domesticity, physical ease, privacy. All these characteristics contribute together to the atmosphere of interior calm that is part of comfort. If this need is not met in the present, it is not unnatural to look for comfort in tradition.\" But the idea of the home as a place of comfort is relatively recent. Medieval thinking did not distinguish the function of an object from its meaning, because of the external character of medieval civilisation: 187 What mattered was the external world and one's place in it. Life was a public affair and just as one did not have a strongly developed self- consciousness, one did not have one's own room...The interior furniture of houses appeared together with the interior furniture of the mind (Lukacs in Rybezynski, p. 36). The idea of house as 'home,' represented in Dutch 17th century genre paintings such as, iconically to us now, Vermeer's, brought together the meanings of house and of household, of dwelling and of refuge, of ownership and of affection. \"Home\" meant the house, but also everything that was in it and around it, as well as the people, and the sense of satisfaction and contentment that all these conveyed. You could walk out of the house, but you always returned home. (Rybezynski, p. 62) Etymology shows interesting divergences and layers to the concept of \"home.\" Rybczynski notes that the word \"home,\" an old Anglo-Saxon word (ham, heym in Dutch) which connotes a physical \"place\" but also has the more abstract sense of a \"state of being,\" has no equivalent in the Latin or Slavic European languages. German, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Dutch, and English all have similar sounding words for \"home,\" all derived from the ON \"heima\" (p. 62). Kurtz and Ketcham, however, emphasize the meaning of \"home\" as the bounded area within which we can define ourselves, discerning between what we are and are not, so creating an identity for ourselves and thus the categories to which we can belong, where we can fit. Etymologically, they argue, this concept of \"fit\" derives from the Indo-European root word KEI, meaning \"a bounded space.\" As source for our words \"home\" and \"hide\" in its dual meaning, as the verb \"to conceal\" and the noun referring to the skin covering an animal, \"home\" can be understood as \"the place where one can hide,\" where one's vulnerability is protected, and one's fittingness unquestioned (1992, p.236). Thus they can say of a place far removed from Vermeer's serene interiors, that \"Home is the place where we can both laugh and cry, where we can find some peace within all the chaos and confusion, where we ... belong, where we fit precisely because of our unfittingness\" (p. 192). In an extended comparison between the religious and the tragic views of the meaning of suffering in human existence, Caputo describes this site of chaos and confusion as perceived by Meister Eckhard, \"the great master of disruption.\" For Eckhard, beneath the cerebral activities of the mind, \"at the base of the soul\" or \"out on the lies \"the ground of the soul,\" Heidegger's \"heart's core.\" It is here that the breakthrough in understanding occurs, of how much greater God is than any system or faculty or sense that humans could muster. But Eckhard says that, rather than a glorious sense of light accompanying this understanding, one had the feeling of falling into a terrible abyss. Meaning collapses in the abyss and with it, all reassurance that our part 188 of our relationship with God is anything but petty and greedy. Eckhard goes on to say that in the face of this realization of the transcendence of God, we begin to make some headway. But to go forward into the mystery is \"strange, uncanny, uncomfortable... the place where all hell broke loose\" (1987, pp. 268-9). Heidegger's term for a state similarly bereft of meaning, and of its comforts, is the \"uncanny\" (Unheimlich), that is, the Un- Home-y! Such a breakthrough\u2014which feels like a breakdown \u2014 in theological certainty has a parallel in hermeneutics, when one's grasp of the conceptual \u2014the \"spell of the conceptuality, the illusion...that we have encompassed the world round about\" also collapses. The surface web of meanings (the \"straw huts of science which we erect against the winds of the withdrawal\" of certainty) so carefully constructed and fiercely defended, grows thin. Through the gaps the flux beneath is exposed. Meaning \u2014or certainty \u2014 withdraws and the movement between the present and the absent, Abwesen and Anwesen, is unsettled and fluctuating. We hover over the abyss and no structure feels fixed (Caputo, p. 270). How are we to accommodate ourselves to such uncertainty? Caputo insists that we continue to \"write from below, without celestial justifications...stay with the flow of physis and not bail out when the going gets rough\" (p.273). I take this to mean that, just because there's a story about a Baby lighting up a stable on the other side of those mountains, it does not necessarily follow that I or those with whom | am given to travel, will ever get to see it. If it is \"Home\" that we are seeking, we may be homeless and in exile for a very long time. This being a human life, the \"flow of physis\" no doubt includes sore feet. Journeying through the flux would seem then to require the ability to find rest\u2014a still place\u2014 and to provide and accept comfort for ourselves and one another, a \"home.\" The telos of the journeying is the Path itself, as well as Light in the stable. What can we say, to return to the way-station in the parish hall, about the \"load of coal\" that Madeleine left in the fourth petal? The reference was familiar. Coal recalls damp northern winters, dirty bins in the basement, cranky foul furnaces that needed much attention if the house were to stay warm. Servants and poor people dealt with coal in its domestic and industrial forms. It was a lowly, dirty, ugly necessity. Coal in your stocking at Christmas is an image known to those of English heritage, a public sign of your poorly-concealed badness, something Father Christmas brought instead of candy, oranges, and toys. Home with coal in the Christmas stocking was not a place where your \"hide\" was safe. But coal, we all knew, was crushed by the earth in some mysterious invisible remote way that produced diamonds. Was it a testimonial to healing, like the piles of crutches at Lourdes, a monument to the crippled kind of love she had suffered all these years? Was it an offering to a deity \u2014 a jealous Mother goddess\u2014 the remains of some kind of sacrificial animal, or the fuel for the fire in which to burn it, as if the pattern on the parish hall floor were a shrine? Was it 189 a contribution to the femenos of the labyrinth process, as if in the hermetic atmosphere of the gathering, the pressure of Madeleine's focused attention when added to all our cumulative faith in that which we could not yet see, energy on which we had relied to keep the labyrinth open all these years, would transmute the ancient shard into a diamond? Madeleine went on to tell me that, during the year in which she came regularly to the labyrinth walks, she was ridding herself of toxic behaviours and substance addictions (\"one every month!\"), and that the labyrinth had been one of her pillars of support. Each time, she'd had a pedicure first (the shiny pink toenails) because it felt so good to walk barefoot on the glossy clean floor. This detail convinced me that the labyrinth path makes it possible for Madeleine, and for me, to reinterpret our journeys with our mothers into pilgrimages. Their intentions may or may not have been good. They saw by the light available to them. They burnt what coal they had. That which they or anyone gives us along the way has the potential to be some quite different substance. Lao Tzu points out in the Tao Te Ching that it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful. We make the doors and windows for a room. But it is these empty spaces that make the room liveable. Thus, while the tangible has advantages, it is the intangible that makes it useful. Pause on the Path: Retrospect on \"Coal\" We had another labyrinth walk last night, and the rush to get out the door via the flower store and through the traffic (full of individuals wanting to throw themselves under the wheels of MY car) and to St Paul's on time had me ina terrible ungenerous mood. But you can't minister like that, yet we have to no matter what, so right there was a clue. Madeleine, the person I wrote about, showed up to honour the anniversary of her mother's death. Some \"sacred dance\" folks came. It turned out to be a warm and motley evening full of human imperfections and moments of great beauty and relief. So this morning I am thinking of a line from Schurmann's book on Eckhard, Wandering Joy, that describes a blissful state of non-attachment, a sort of at-home-in-the- void, which would have responded to the Question of \"how are we to manage?\" But what was missing in it, for me, was a woman's response, with our unavoidable attachments to the texture of kids and home-life. I am so painfully aware of our \"homelessness,\" from real refugee displacement, to our \"displaced\" psychic state. There is also the image of the BVM making \"home\" in a stable, an architectural image that 190 connects it to Caputo's Hut (of science) and Bachelard's House in winter. It still leaves us wandering in the flux, until Madeleine's gesture to the holly coalesced the understanding that women make altars wherever we go, little lovely temporary and contingent arrangements where we attend to the moment \u2014and REST\u2014 that perfectly capture a cross-section of hermeneutic. So in the labyrinth, at that gathering, Madeleine brings a load of memory \"coal\" and stops by the holly altar to greet it and me, and I attend to her experience, invisible and unarticulated as it might be \u2014 all I see is her gesture of stroking the leaves \u2014 bringing to it, concatenating, my own memories of the negative Mother. It really is a way-station, and even when we reach the Centre (of whatever we're in: labyrinth, journey, understanding) we still have to go back out. This ties in with Rank on the dual need \u2014a feminine divinity responds with Both/And \u2014 with Caputo we write/seek from the stable floor up and the Star down. This is the invisible verticality of the labyrinth. 8. IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION .\" \"To trenglate, to open up a path through 6 language by using its resources, to decide upon: one meaning, is to escape the agonizing, aporetic impasses of any translation, to make the philosophical gesture par excellence: the gesture of ia pee A Zeck vines (in phen Alternate interpretations remain uninvoked 191 192 Back at the beginning If this were a labyrinth walk, we'd be on the last circuit, the one passing right by the sanctuary in the centre \"glowing in the middle like a gem is a bouquet of deep red and pale pink roses from the market, fresh and verdant in a little globe vase; surrounding it a cluster of flickering beeswax candles and a little green and red stone incense burner giving off clouds of lotus fragrance smoke.\" Ahead lies the final switchback before the straight path to the entrance and the step back out into the world. There is a feeling of ambivalence between the desire to linger in a serene, poetic state of mind, pondering over the loaded image, the flash of insight, the clue of a narrative fragment, and the energetic bounce out of the circle and into the arena of life. \"Then I was filled with energy and could barely hold still. I had to slow down in the circuits round the centre because everyone else was quiet and solemn. But as soon as the path was clear, I danced around again. I felt like my old laughing self once more. It's a sign. When we make a decision that's good for our soul, our bodies get all that life force back. lam very grateful to be feeling it, this life force.\" Coming back to the entrance at the end of the labyrinth walk is an aesthetic experience such as Gadamer describes, \"not just one kind of experience among others, but represent[ing] the essence of experience per se.\" The labyrinth is like the work of art in that each \"is a world for itself, so ...what is experienced aesthetically is... removed from all connections with actuality.\" And like the work of art, engagement with the labyrinth is \"almost by definition an aesthetic experience: that means... that the power of the work of art suddenly tears the person experiencing it out the context of his life, and yet relates him back to the whole of his existence,\" presenting \"a fullness of meaning that belongs not only to this particular content or object but rather stands for the meaningful whole of life\" (2003, p.70). \"The turns need attention, in the labyrinth as in life, the change in direction, the altered trajectory. I can stumble, inch, plod, twirl, and dance through this altered course. Each turn alongside the solid, substantial labryses lets you look around. The cardinal directions are invoked. It's a ritual that realigns you with the four directions; five, when you watch your feet; six, if you look up, and see the moon shining in through the window.\" 193 Walking out of the labyrinth\u2014re-aggregating\u2014 on the path of \"communion\" and return to the world, is bittersweet. After experiencing real life in the suspended kairos time of a symbolic place, perception is altered to a different magnification, lives and intention have shifted and refocused. A year ago I was going in this same direction, but now my whole perspective has changed. This path includes that time, but I have moved along. Then, I was shocked, hurt, troubled. Even a month ago, I was still furious and ill. Now, the crisis has passed, the sickness has gone, the life force has returned. This new feeling is one I recognize, I remember what it was like to be happy and full of life, because here it is again, separated by what was in between, the other path, the sorrowful one, the via negativa. Looking back to the goal at the beginning of this long journey, the Sealed Orders that appeared like invisible writing on the surface of consciousness, these central ideas still resonate, underpinning the research questions: What will teach us to respond to the new, not in fear, but with the intention of dialogue? Will walking the labyrinth support the project to restore our sense of the transcendent in the everyday, when every day we confront environments designed to \"format\" and rationalize our minds' activities, our bodies' perceptions and the quality of our communal encounters? Is it a technology sufficiently powerful to counteract the numbing influence of fear and rationalisation upon our imagination of the possible? Will it help us to get through the darkness and make our way Home? 194 A circuitous route in review In the move we are making from the modernist \"industrial growth\" age \u2014 where all of us grew up and most of us were educated \u2014 to a postmodernist, life-sustaining one, our survival depends on leaving behind the current dominator model and turning instead towards interdependence and inter-subjectivity (Eisler, 1987), relations that surely require of us an attitude such as the Dalai Lama described. This is the educational imperative of our time. We know that relying primarily on instrumental reason is neither sufficient, nor appropriate, for the challenges facing us as individuals and as a species. Such one-sidedness leaves too much out for us to make good decisions in times like these. Palmer describes this one-sided reductionism as one of the great sins in education... the destruction of otherness that occurs when we try to cram everything we study into categories we are comfortable with\u2014ignoring data or writers or voices or simple facts that don't fit, lacking simple respect for the ways in which reality is other than we want it or imagine it to be (1999, p. 23). Counterbalancing our culture's emphasis on the rational with intentional experience in the non-rational dimensions \u2014 the mythic and the transpersonal \u2014 grounds us in the wisdom of our perceiving bodies and restores our connectedness to Spirit and our communion with one another. To recognize, translate and express the insights that arise in the experience of the non-rational, we need experiential tools and methods, including a working language of metaphor. We have such a toolkit readily accessible in the history, origins, stories and practices of the labyrinth. A review of these gifts of the ancestors will simultaneously bring to mind the call, from the Spirit Matters Conference on Wisdom, for embodied knowledge, a sense of home, transmission of ritual as community practice, the use of myth and metaphor, a relationship with the Other, and the need for a language beyond dualism. The power of the labyrinth lies in its origins, long before the Cartesian split between mind and body, subject and object, caused such dualism in our thinking and disconnect between our rational selves and the rest of creation (including our non-rational selves). As we have seen, the people who built the labyrinth at Chartres did so in a context that was extraordinarily sensitive and articulate about such connections: one could say that it originated in our own pre-modern Wisdom tradition. Where and when the labyrinth came into being, and who designed it, reveals the medieval worldview of the twelfth century in 195 northern France. So strongly did the Masters of the School believe in the concept of diversity-in-Unity that they dedeveloped an entire architectural system to make manifest their philosophy, an environment to which we fortunately still have access. Reconciliation, clarity, and metaphor may be seen illustrated in the iconography in the windows and sculptures, and the symbolism underlying the geometrical ratios throughout Chartres Cathedral that express the idea of potential associated with Mary. In the curriculum and philosophy of the School of Chartres a way of thinking prevails specifically intended to address difference and bridge polarities: the reconciliation of opposing ideas within an all- encompassing unity, and transparency of means, elements, and parts. These were ideas accessible to the medieval cognitive repertoire which had a fine appreciation for metaphor and allegory. These tools, so useful for working with opposites, are central to the function of the imagination. Development of the imagination was fundamental to Chartraine pedagogy, as we have seen in the discussion on the Medieval craft of thought.\" The labyrinth was intended to enhance the imagination, by people who prized this faculty. This above al! makes it an essential tool for our present educational needs. The next section outlines how the labyrinth, understood as technology, functions as an important support for the imagination in the service of education. Labyrinth as technology The labyrinth is a real place at the same time as it is symbolic space, so the inquiry has been concerned with what happens in a mindful walk through a labyrinth, in terms of how we physically experience our intentional bodies and perceiving selves walking in symbolic and, indeed, mythically charged space. In other words, we have looked at how the mythical dimension used as a narrative (and reflective) template combines with walking meditation as a pedagogy of embodied learning, to engage the imagination in the labyrinth and effect significant transformations of perspective and consciousness. The labyrinth serves as an externalized spatial \"extension\" technology, in the sense McLuhan uses, and simultaneously as an inner technology, an example of Foucault's \"hermeneutic of the self.\" \"\u00b0 tt is central also in a contemporary curriculum initiative, led by Kieran Egan and his associates in the Imaginative Education Research Group at Simon Fraser University, that focuses on engaging the imagination. The success this initiative is meeting in pilot projects with Aboriginal school populations is most encouraging. 196 The boundaries between real and mythic blur in the real yet symbolic space. The collective function of the myth narrative and the archetypal characters associated with the labyrinth, and the way these forces operate in our cultural storerooms and individual imaginations, suggested how the lived-through experience of \"crossing over\" into symbolic landscape can serve as an extended metaphor to probe our interpretations of events and encounters. Finally, given the analogy of the Minotaur myth to the tenuous situation in the world, it has become clear that a skilful use of the labyrinth can be a powerful support for the imagination in subverting the \"technologies of domination\" and creating a different story of the world we live in and the relationships we support. The labyrinth itself suggests ways in which we can make this happen. The cathedral labyrinth was always located in the western end of the nave, marking the transition between secular space and sacred space, which suggests that it was part of rituals developed for that purpose. (Recall that the elders recommended rituals as community practice.) Thus the labyrinth can be understood as a technology, techn\u00e9, in the sense of a tool for doing something, and/or a way of doing things, a standard process. This is a departure from our normal definition of technology as the hardware and software of electronic communication systems, but not all that much. Foucault refers to \"technologies of mind,\" distinguishing between those of the self, and those of domination: (1) technologies of production, which permit us to produce, transform, or manipulate things; (2) technologies of sign systems, which permit us to use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification; (3) technologies of power, which determine the conduct of individuals and submit them to certain ends or domination, an objectivizing of the subject; (4) technologies of the self, which permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality. These four technologies hardly ever function separately, although each one of them is associated with a certain type of domination. Each implies certain modes of training and modification of individuals, not only in the obvious sense of acquiring certain skills but also in the sense of acquiring certain attitudes. (1988. p.16. Italics added) 197 One could say that the labyrinth in the manuscript margin functioned as a technology of sign system, while the cathedral type is a technology of the self, a way to transform oneself. McLuhan's ideas about tools and technologies as extensions of the human body, as the pen is an extension of the finger in the dust, the car an extension of the foot, the telephone an extension of the voice, and the electronic communication network an extension, according to McLuhan, of the human central nervous system, provide a means to respond to the question arising from his First Law of Media, the law of Extension/Enhancement: Every technology extends or amplifies some organ or faculty of the user. which McLuhan says we ought to ask of any technology: \"Of which human faculty or organ is it an extension?\" Theologian Matthew Fox provides a clue when he speaks of \"inner technologies,\" by which he means, among other things, ways of integrating our three levels of brain development. He includes in this category chanting and all forms of meditation, especially art-as-process, and the mindfulness practices. These are traditional means of soothing the oldest reptilian part of our brain, what Fox calls the \"crocodile\" part, so that fight-or-flight primitive response system can feel safe and stand down from vigilance. The inner technologies allow the analytical, processing cerebral cortex to disengage from the incessant activity that Buddhists call \"monkey mind.\" This lets the limbic, nurturing, mammalian part of the brain begin to renew its sense of being-in-relation (Fox, 1999; 2002, pp. 189-196). Walking meditation, like dancing, activates the first chakra, which is associated with feeling grounded and invigorated, and provides the foundation for the lower chakras, so undereducated in Western culture. The centre of the labyrinth has a point-to-point correspondence with the central chakra, known as the fourth or \"heart\" chakra, thus the gateway to the higher chakras of expression and justice, higher thought, and evolutionary potential.'*' The essential instructions to a person new to labyrinth walking, \"Find your own pace. Pay attention to your breath.\" come from this awareness. The most frequent result that participants report is a sensation of being both energized and serene, and an awareness that the others walking are \"all on the same Path.\" '} personal communication, July 6, 2005. See Chapter 5 in Sins of the Spirit. 198 Combining this account with the idea of the cathedral labyrinth as pilgrimage site suggests that the labyrinth is a technology to support, in a formal anthropological sense, the three stage ritual process described by Turner of separation, liminality, and re-aggregation. While the participant, or initiate, comes out of the process with a new social identity, as a liminar in the middle phase, their psychological state is \"betwixt and between\" (1979; 1969, p. 95).'\" Turner distinguishes between the liminal rituals of agrarian, tribal peoples, which are \"collective, concerned with calendrical, biological, and social structural cycles, are integrated into the total social process, and reflect the collective experience of a community over time,\" and those of industrial (and post-industrial) people, which he describes as liminoid genres: they are historically connected with and often displace rituals which possess true liminal phases, and they also share important characteristics with liminal processes and states, such as \"subjectivity,\" escape from the classifications of everyday life, symbolic reversals, destruction\u2014at a deep level\u2014 of social distinctions, and the like. Liminoid phenomena, unlike liminal phenomena, tend to develop apart from central political and economic processes, along the margins, in the interstices, on the interfaces of central and servicing institutions... Their symbols are closer to the personal-psychological than to the objective-social typological pole... Liminoid phenomena, unlike liminal, do not so much invert as subvert quotidian and prestigious structures and symbols. (1979, pp. 115-116). Turner includes writing and producing stage dramas, novels and poetry, painting and sculpture among liminoid genres, also circuses, parades, carnivals and other collective public spectacles within what he calls the \"leisure sphere.\" One could say therefore that walking a cathedral labyrinth in the thirteenth century would probably have been a liminal experience, whereas in our era, to do so is a liminoid one. Given that simply to do so \"subverts the quotidian structure\" of contemporary public life, it is a significant decision on the part of the participant. Why this is will be explained in the next section. But keep in mind, if you will, the image of the school mentioned earlier, where the labyrinth is a well-maintained site on '? Arnold van Gennep, originator of this theory of ritual, distinguishes between the three stages as: (1) separation (from ordinary social life); (2) margin or limen (meaning threshold), when the subjects of ritual fall into a limbo between their past and present modes of daily existence; and (3) re-aggregration, when they are ritually returned to secular or mundane life \u2014 either at a higher status level or in an altered state of consciousness or social being. Turner, 1979, p. 95. 199 the school grounds, students can hang out there alone or with their friends, free to walk it without fear of interrogation or judgment. Imagination as contested space The definitions of imagination employed by researchers into the educational imagination, such as Kieran Egan, invoke a quality of spaciousness, as for example, Alan White's description: the \"imaginative person is one with the ability to think of lots of possibilities, usually with some richness of detail.\" It brings to mind Maxine Greene's person who \"chooses to view herself in the midst of things,\" for whom then \"a space of freedom opens\" (Greene, 1995; White, 1990). Mary Warnock evokes a vastness both spatial and temporal when she identifies \"the belief... that there is more in our experience of the world than can possibly meet the unreflecting eye ... that there is always more to experience, and more in what we experience than we can predict... may be referred to as the feeling of infinity\" (1978, p. 202). Does this not sound like a well-furnished mind? Or the clutter of an artist's studio? Or, something we could definitely use right now, a cosmology, a story of where we come from and what we're here for, that has room for all of us? This association with space and time makes sense when we consider that the etymology of the word imagination includes the Latin imago. The plural form imagines refers to wax portrait masks of distinguished ancestors of noble rank. In the Republican period of Roman history, these masks were kept in wooden shrines as part of the ancestral displays in the atrium, the formal public reception area of the aristocratic family home. When any member of the family died, the portrait masks were taken out and worn by actors, costumed in the appropriate toga and regalia, during the public funeral procession, eulogies, and ritual sacrifice staged by families in honour of the departed. Such public displays reinforced the legitimacy of the ruling class and the status quo by appealing to traditional Roman ideals of political stability and common heritage across generations and, increasingly, social class. This admittedly distant point of origin is a reminder that, while we may think of and experience the imagination as a private place, it functions at the interface between the public and private spheres of memory and influence \u2014 between the civic and the domestic, the Romans might say. Any optimistic discourse about social change count on the imagination as the source of unexpected insights and new visions: \"imagining things being otherwise\" (Greene, 1995, p.22); \"[e]very important social movement reconfigures the world in the 200 imagination. What was obscure comes forward, lies are revealed, memory shaken, new delineations drawn on old maps\" (Griffin, 1996, p.45). \"Imagination...is the power of constructing possible models of human experience\" says Northrop Frye (1963, p.5). However, there is a shadow side: Frye, in his discussion of public discourse, traces the descent from the clich\u00e9s of social \"myths of adjustment\"\u2014 of which the Roman aristocracy's custom of parading the family's ancestor portraits was an early example. Working through the rise of the use of distancing euphemisms such as \"anti-personnel bombs,\" to the deliberate debasement of language in outright Orwellian tyranny portrayed in the novel /984, he points out that The essential thing is the power of choice. In wartime this power of choice is greatly curtailed, and we resign ourselves to living by half-truths for the duration. In a totalitarian state the competition in propaganda largely disappears, and consequently the power of imaginative choice is sealed off. In our hatred and fear of war and of totalitarian government, one central element is a sense of claustrophobia that the imagination develops when it isn't allowed to function properly (1963, p.63). and warns that The first thing our imaginations have to do for us, as soon as we can handle words well enough to read and write and talk, is to fight to protect us from falling into the illusions that society threatens us with (p.60). Kearney expresses a similar concern, arguing that, \"We no longer appear to know who exactly produces or controls the images which condition our consciousness.\" The prevalence of mass media and global marketing ensures that \"the image has become less and less the expression of an individual subject and more and more the commodity of an anonymous consumerist technology\" (Kearney, 1988, pp. 3, 6). Matthew Fox says, \"the Empire only wants its own images used,\" and quotes from eco-poet Drew Dellinger's Love Song to the Milky Way, about \"kids with Nike engraved on their psyche!\" Susan Griffin distinguishes between oppression and self-censorship, or perhaps the failure-to-thrive of the un-nurtured: One fears that solitary and unique voices will be silenced by mass tyranny, yet this is not the only danger. In an atomized and alienated society, the \\ Science, Mysticism and Faith: Cosmic Christ in Post-Modern Times. Lecture # 2. Vancouver School of Theology, July 5, 2005. 201 imagination is endangered by the limitations of the ego...of being restricted to a canvas that is too small (1996, p. 46). What if this imagination is not only limited in imagery but is also under duress from fear, coercion, and intimidation? What becomes of the capacity of that imagination to think of possibilities? Bereft of compassion or justice, what can guide it? Here, at the edge of the metaphoric framework of the myth, one could ask what has filled the ritual space of the labyrinth with such images of defence and aggression. Who let the Minotaur out? And whose Minotaur is it, anyway? What's it doing there? And where is \"there\"? It depends upon one's perspective. For the other victims of King Minos, the young Athenians, the labyrinth was a doomed, hellish place. For Queen Pasiphie, it was a closet to conceal the unmentionable. For Daedalus, it was a masterpiece so diabolical that it surpassed its creator\u2014even he needed wings or string to escape from it. For Ariadne, it represented a dilemma calling for a strategy. For Theseus, it was an arena in which to prove his worth. For the Minotaur, the labyrinth was a prison-fort, rendering him into a weapon. Crossing now between the symbolic and the actual, if these individuals represent projections of our collective and individual mind, can we see what the existence of all these perspectives might offer us? Otherness In tracing the history of a myth, more important than the date of any manuscript illumination is the idea incarnated in its imagery. (Chance, 1994, p. xi) The Minotaur once lurked in the centre of the labyrinth at Chartres cathedral, before allegedly being melted down for cannonballs during the Revolution. This misbegotten creature was the result of an encounter between Queen Pasiphie and the bull from the sea, instigated by the jealous Olympian deity Poseidon to punish the ambitious King Minos. The encounter, and later, the famous Labyrinth of Crete were both contrived by the brilliant designer-inventor Daedalus, who provides the perfect example of the Imagination \u2014- and creativity \u2014 in the service of greed and power. and an object lesson on the necessity for a Moral Imagination. 202 This is a charged mythic image, long after our cultural identification of cattle with wealth and power has been replaced by other symbols. Minotaurs are therianthropic monsters, animal and human forms combined, one of the few\u2014perhaps the only one in Greek mythology, unlike the Egyptian pantheon\u2014 with an animal head: the horror lies in not knowing how far the human extends, and how far the animal. Grandchild of the sun god Helios through his sorceress mother Pasiphde, the Minotaur provokes a powerful response. He represents \"a kind of anarchic energy, a horrible distortion of nature\" (Thorpe, 1992, 48). To the writer and sculptor Michael Ayrton, he was \"an image of the agonies of evolution out of the animal and toward the human condition\" (in Pennick, 1990, p.160)... \"his instincts are double and in perpetual conflict.. His urge to murder is not a lust but his response to the uncertainty by which, so far as his slow brain permits, he is tormented\" (1967, pp. 188, 189)'*\u00b0 A key lies in the poet Dante's encounter with the monster. Dante, nursing his outrage after exile from his own city, realizes that violent revenge is not for him: \"All the rage that burns within awaits creative transformation ...the Minotaur becomes a symbol for the wrath that can consume us if we fail to find a way to acknowledge and use it\" (Thorpe, p.48). Underneath anger is fear. The Minotaur represents the fundamental dualism of subject/object relations, taken to the extreme of demonizing that which is different: \"This fear of otherness comes in part from having flattened our intellectual terrain and desacralized it: people who know the sacred know radical otherness. But in a two-dimensional culture, we don't possess that sensibility any more\" (Palmer, p. 24). Whereas \"if you met a monkey or a bull...in India, you could be sure that you were in the presence of the gods\" (O'Flaherty, 1989, p.22). If we are seriously to undertake the project of understanding the thoughts, worldview, and situatedness of that which or whom we wish to communicate with, to learn to respond to the new with an intention of dialogue, we have to begin with examining assumptions about \"other-ness\" embedded in the cultural narratives of separation and communion between gods, animals, and humans. Learning to understand other people's mythologies, appreciating the legitimacy of another perspective, while admitting the 4 yecu: cattle, the Latin root of pecuniary, impecunious etc. '' The Minotaur in Picasso's Vollard Suite comes to mind, who had girlfriends and went to parties, but, alas, ends up blinded and being led about by a little gir] with flowers, wounded and eventually killed. He suffers violence but is never shown inflicting it. 203 inevitability of separateness, avoids the obstacles of alienation and aversion. Bull-human couplings are part of the Cretan myth cycle (e.g. Zeus as bull and the nymph Europa), but the Minotaur story has a unique sub-text of prohibition and punishment, which says something about Greek discomfort with the a-rational, and our own. Another approach to the problem of other-ness is Deleuze and Guattari's concept of metamorphosis known as \" becoming-animal,\" part of their becoming-minoritarian ethos, which they see as a political activity of counter-hegemonic solidarity with marginalized groups. Becomings-animal are ways \"which the animal proposes to the human by indicating ways-out or means of escape which the human would never have thought of by himself.\" This is not anthropomorphism but an imagination-based act of willed de-subjectivizing, a stepping away from ego-identity. Arguing against unexamined assumptions, officially sanctioned interpretation and the subsequent diminution of creativity, they challenge us with that memorable exhortation to \"write like a rat!\" (in Baker, 2000, pp. 102, 113).'*\u00b0 We could learn about destabilizing our modernist assumptions about identity from recent achievements in art-making and aesthetic practice. This genre responds to Donna Haraway's work on the \"place of the human in a post-humanist landscape,\" where, transformed in a historical \"we are all cyborgs...theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism...a subtle and complex compound of the organic, technical, mythic, textual and political\" (in Baker, p. 100). This post-modern creature is disconcerting, with the traces of transgression, like that which produced the Minotaur, being layered with the Frankensteinian disregard for consequences characteristic of scientism's aloofness from moral concerns: \"[H]ybrid forms unsettle boundaries...of the human and non-human. In the values of modernity...there was a widespread urge to homogenize and systematize, to render the world intelligible by eliminating or suppressing inconsistencies, impurities and dissimilarities\" (Baker, p. 99). In this post-modemist interpretation, it is the modernist perspective that is anomalous, departing from the medieval view of difference in that \"6 In her Deep Ecology practice, Buddhist and eco-activist Joanna Macy has developed a consciousness- changing ritual called the Council of All Beings, which connects with and extends Deleuze and Guattari's creative and political concerns in extraordinarily sensitive ways. See http://www.joannamacy.net/html/deep.html#. Accessed 15/08/2006. We today tend to ride over the differences so as to discover the common laws that lie within them all. We reduce the multiplicity of life to its basic common factors. The middle ages abhorred sameness and uniformity. They gloried in multiplicity as part of the Divine order (James, 1982, p.98). Meeting the extraordinary gang of carved stone creatures frolicking ee around the North Tower at Chartres, described earlier, it is hard not to agree that \"embracing of impurity, hybridity and monstrosity could be seen as a positively creative move\" (Baker, p. 100). Not only is the variety of forms astonishing, but even more striking is the thought that long ago some administrator actually decided to fund the process of commissioning, conceiving, planning, carving and installing \u2014 in an out-of-the-way niche in a tower hundreds of feet in the air\u2014 such playful figures. But their hybridity also expressed the idea of being simultaneously a part of and a translator between several worlds, realms of air, water, earth, even fire. The sense of identification I felt with them came out of my identity as an interdisciplinary scholar. If they could speak, what would they say? What could we learn of a life in stone, or the possibilities of multidimensional habitus and perception? Beyond monsters Earlier we saw that, in the context of the cathedral, the labyrinth could be considered a part of the ritual of initiation. A primary purpose of liminal ritual structure is to allow the group and the individual to accommodate the upheaval of transitional states and transformational processes. It is thus an essential part of the process of reflexive \"stock-taking\" on the part of the community, what Dewey (1934, p. 272) would define as the imagination, \"the conscious adjustment of the new and the old.\" By walking into the protected liminal space of the labyrinth, the temenos, or container, and using the meditative skills of breathing and mindful awareness to calm one's disrupted self, the walker, seeker or pilgrim, can address, with a compassionate and open mind and heart, the situation confronting her: Is it a Minotaur? Or my fugitive self in the mirror? Buddhists might ask, as does Sr Chan Khong (Thich Nhat Hanh's colleague at Plum Village in France): Is it a snake? Or is it just a rope?(Galland, 1998, p.280). I would suggest that the faculty of which the labyrinth is an extension is that capacity we have to balance polarities, to reconcile opposites, to encompass multiplicity, to seek 205 homeostasis, however briefly. The most telling image from the myth is that escape from the labyrinth is by wings or by string: by gaining an overview or by working slowly through al the twists and turns. By experiencing journey as story \u2014 Am I lost? Or is this the long way HOME?\u2014 using narrative as the connecting thread, we can accommodate many perspectives and live-through many turning-points. We too can begin to dialogue with mystery. Why every neighbourhood should have a labyrinth We have seen that the labyrinth is a powerful tool in the areas that most matter to education in our time because it was designed, from the outset, by people who cared very much about education, to enhance and provoke the imagination, and to provide that often vulnerable capacity with a context that clearly welcomed potentiality and reconciliation, and a shared language rich enough in visual and verbal metaphor to convey its products to a receptive and discerning community. This is clearly a need we have not yet outgrown. Imagine walking into the centre and finding no \"us\" and \"them\" there. Imagine, right now, what a collective image of peace on Earth would feel like. Go on, imagine what a collective experience of peace on Earth would feel like. We have seen that movement, music, candlelight, and other sensorial cues become part of the symbol system incorporated by the imagination in its work of providing metaphors to guide these transitional explorations into embodied knowledge. We know that the labyrinth was originally designed as public sacred art, its rituals taking the form of liturgical dance, music, drama and play. Contemporary renewal of this tradition creates deeply moving, memorable, even transcendent experiences, inclusive of all participants, with everyone helping to contribute, whether or not they believe they are artists, or talented, or good enough, or sufficiently spiritual or deserving. The labyrinth encompasses all things. We have seen that the labyrinth is a site where individuals suffering from stress, loss, discouragement, disconnection, confusion and despair, in relation to their community, family, or even their own sense of narrative, can negotiate the decisions they need to make to restore a sense of belonging, using the symbolic material freely generated by the enhanced imaginative function. This is a healing and restorative function to be celebrated: imagine young people going to the labyrinth to figure out where they want to belong, rather than erupting in class, or quitting school, or choosing the camaraderie of violence or drugs, or 206 nihilism? Imagine how reassuring it would be to know that there was a labyrinth for you to go and walk in, every day if you wanted to, a safe place to think, to restore yourself and to regain your balance. Imagine what you would think of an institution took the well-being of its students that seriously. Earlier we looked at a variety of reports from current practitioners on how they are using labyrinths. The presence of a labyrinth in each of these public institutional settings makes a major statement about the value accorded to inner developmental process in relation to the pressing questions of personal vocation, social contribution, and one's place in the world, and the concerns about peace, conflict, and justice for individuals in their own lives and the larger community and global arena. I try to imagine what it would be like as a school child to have a labyrinth (and teachers supporting its use) as part of the school landscape. How different recess might have been, with a symbol of reconciliation given as much legitimacy and space on the school grounds as the competitive sports battlefield has! Imagine how power dynamics might shift with a labyrinth to help clarify and articulate emergent understandings of what \"home\" and \"belonging\" actually mean. Community programming focused inquiry Finding my own interests moving towards praxis, I will close with some ideas for further research, and a brief account of what I foresee developing next. Labyrinth practice has reached a stage of public acceptance in the community, usually as a program sponsored by an institution such as a church or school, or health care or retreat facility. Protocols have been developed, drawing from established support group and organisational development procedures (see Appendix 11 for extraordinarily sensitive protocol and language being developed for use with Emergency Response workers). The potential for partnering and linkages between education, health service, and the justice system exist in abundance. Research suggests itself along the lines of comparative ethnographic studies between and among communities, congregations, and groups with labyrinths. As one emerging area of concern is the maintenance of the programs after the original \"champion\" has moved on, specific longitudinal study of stages in 207 development of \"keeper\" communities could be useful in identifying how the corporate memory is maintained over time and through changes in administration, program focus, and client needs. Individual focused inquiry At an individual level, a closer look at the relationship between labyrinth and participant has possibilities in several areas. Who uses the labyrinth? Why? What draws these individuals to try it? Does the labyrinth experience \"form\" the participant somehow? In what ways and dimensions? One area to study is significant patterns of occurrence of visual, auditory, haptic imagery, sensations and insights in relation with intention and situational factors such as ambient conditions and life events. A research program could include pre- and post- profiling, possibly comparing one-time intervention with cumulative use, to ascertain the effect and appropriateness of use in stress and post-trauma treatment, age/stage life transition counselling, and conflict resolution applications. Next steps Having spent several years far from a proper Chartres style labyrinth, I am looking forward to relocating to a place where I can build my own. This will be part of a larger project of renovating and expanding a residence designed for \"assisted living\" clients with impaired mobility. Spending time with individuals whose paths are not easy, as well as dealing with assorted health issues of my own, has allowed a glimpse of life in another person's shoes. I once facilitated and shared a walk with a support group of mental health clients including one gentlemen with a cane who took two hours to traverse the labyrinth, continuing long after the others had moved on to another part of the program. Perceptions of time transformed in tangible ways during this extenuated episode: everything slowed down, each muscle flicker and weight shift became a fragment of a gesture. The path on the floor rose up to meet my feet, as I fell forward in slow motion at every step. Always we trust that the earth will catch us when we fall. Sharing a labyrinth with others is a powerful way to become aware of the particularity of each one's journey along the Path we all must take. Thus it has been surprisingly easy to imagine the possibilities for this residence project, from the placement of ramps and a solarium, to the healing garden/horticultural therapy component in the courtyard around the labyrinth. It is easy to see it both sheltered from the road and addressing 208 the street corner at the entrance to an expanding subdivision, providing a site for the residents and neighbours to encounter one another across the boundaries of public and private spheres, the divides of wellness and disability, stability and transience, the transcendent and the everyday. Easy also to imagine the place as a site for co-op learning in horticulture, health care service providing, occupational and health therapies, by local students, on behalf of local seniors, in partnership with the local school boards, community college, regional health authority and churches, all engaged in the difficult and necessary work of making this a community we can all call home. At this moment between inhalation and exhalation, we are at the turning point, the place where, unlike the cave which represents security, peace, and absence of danger...the primal form is the spiral, an expression of seeking, movement, and danger and...always an expression of the possibility of advancing rather than returning into unconsciousness and timelessness (Gebser, 1992, p. 63). APPENDIX 1 A collection of primary sources for the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur Retrieved June 10, 2006, from http://www.theoi.com/Ouranos/Minotauros.html Minos sailed against Athens with a fleet, not believing that the Athenians were innocent of the death of [his son] Androgeos [killed by the Marathonian Bull], and sorely harassed them until it was agreed that he should take seven maidens and seven boys for the Minotauros that was said to dwell in the Labyrinth at Knossos. \u2014Pausanias 1.27.10 The god [Delphoi oracle] told them [the to give Minos whatever retribution he should chose ... He ordered them to send seven young men and seven girls, unarmed, to be served as food to the Minotauros. The Minotauros was kept in a labyrinth, from which there was no escape after one entered, for it closed off its imperceivable exit with convoluted flexions. It had been constructed by Daidalos. -Apollodorus 3.213 Theseus was on the list of the third tribute to the Minotauros (some say he volunteered) ... [Ariadne] pleaded with Daidalos to tell her the way out of the labyrinth. Following his instructions, she gave Theseus a ball of thread as he entered. He fastened this to the door and let it trail behind him as he went in. He came across the Minotauros in the furthest section of the labyrinth, killed him with jabs of his fist, and then made his way out again by pulling himself along the thread. -Apollodorus E1.7-1.9 Minos aspired to the throne [of Krete], but was rebuffed. He claimed, however, that he had received the sovereignty from the gods, and to prove it he said that whatever he prayed for would come about. So while sacrificing to Poseidon, he prayed for a bull to appear from the depths of the sea, and promised to sacrifice it upon its appearance. And Poseidon did send up to him a splendid bull. Thus Minos received the rule, but he sent the bull to his herds and sacrificed another ... Poseidon was angry that the bull was not sacrificed, and turned it wild. He also devised that Pasiphiie should develop a lust for it. In her passion for the bull she took on as her accomplice an architect named Daidalos ... He built a wooden cow on wheels, ... skinned a real cow, and sewed the contraption into the skin, and then, after placing Pasiphie inside, set it in a meadow where the bull normally grazed. The bull came up and had intercourse with it, as if with a real cow. Pasiphie gave birth to Asterios, who was called Minotauros. He had the face of a bull, but was otherwise human. Minos, following certain oracular instructions, kept him confined and under guard in the labyrinth. This labyrinth, which Daidalos built, was a \"cage with convoluted flexions that disorders debouchment.\" -Apollodorus 3.8-11 Not long afterwards [Theseus' arrival in Athens] there came from Krete for the third time the collectors of the tribute ... an agreement to send him [Minos] every nine years a tribute of seven youths and as many maidens. And the most dramatic version of the story declares that these young men and women, on being brought to Krete, were destroyed by the Minotauros in the Labyrinth, or else wandered about at their own will and, being unable to find an exit, perished there; and that the Minotauros, as Euripides says, was 'A mingled form and hybrid birth of monstrous shape', and that 'Two different natures, man and bull, were joined in him ... Hellanikos ... Says the agreement was that the Athenians should furnish the ship, and that the youths should embark and sail with him carrying no warlike weapon, and that if the Minotauros was killed the penalty should cease. On the two former occasions, then, no hope of safety was entertained, and therefore they sent the ship with a black sail, convinced that their youth were going to certain 209 210 destruction; but now Theseus encouraged his father and loudly boasted that he would master the Minotauros, so that he gave the pilot another sail, a white one, ordering him, if he returned with Theseus safe, to hoist the white sail, but otherwise to sail with the black one, and so indicate the affliction ... When he reached Krete on his voyage, most historians and poets tell us that he got from Ariadne, who had fallen in love with him, the famous thread, and that having been instructed by her how to make his way through the intricacies of the Labyrinth, he slew the Minotauros and sailed off with Ariadne and the youths. -Plutarch Theseus 15.1 & 17.3 & 19.1 Pasiphae, the wife of Minos, became enamoured of the bull, and Daidalos, by fashioning a contrivance in the shape of a cow, assisted Pasiphie to gratify her passion. In explanation of this the myths offer the following account: before this time it had been the custom of Minos annually to dedicate to Poseidon the fairest bull born in his herds and to sacrifice it to the god; but at the time in question there was born a bull of extraordinary beauty and he sacrificed another from among those which were inferior, whereupon Poseidon becoming angry at Minos, caused his wife Pasiphade to become enamoured of the bull. And by means of the ingenuity of Daidalos Pasiphde had intercourse with the bull and gave birth to the Minotauros, famed in the myth. This creature, they say, was of double form, the upper parts of the body as far as the shoulders being those of a bull and the remaining parts those of a man. As a place in which to keep this monstrous thing Daidalos, the story goes, built a labyrinth, the passage-ways of which were so winding that those unfamiliar with them had difficulty in making their way out; in this labyrinth the Minotaur was maintained and here it devoured the seven youths and seven maidens which were sent to it from Athens, as we have already related. \u2014Diodorus Siculus 4.77.1 Minos commanded them [the Athenians as recompense for the murder of his son Androgeus] that they give seven youths and as many maidens every nine years to the Minotauros for him to devour, for as long as the monster should live. And when the Athenians gave them, the inhabitants of Attika were rid of their evils and Minos ceased warring on Athens ... Theseus after conversing with her [Ariadne the daughter of Minos] and securing her assistance, both slew the Minotauros and got safely away, since he had learned from her the way out of the labyrinth. \u2014 Diodorus Siculus 4.61.4 Pasiphie, daughter of Sol [Helios] and wife of Minos, for several years did not make offerings to the goddess Venus. Because of this Venus inspired in her an unnatural love for a bull. At the time when Daedalus came there as an exile, he asked her to help him. For her he made a wooden heifer, and put in it the hide of a real heifer, and in this she lay with the bull. From this intercourse she bore the Minotaur, with bull's head but human body. Then Daedalus made for the Minotaur a labyrinth with an undiscoverable exit in which it was confined. When Minos found out the affair he cast Daedalus into prison, but Pasiphde freed him from his chains ... After he [Minos] conquered the Athenians their revenues became his; he decreed, moreover that each year they should send seven of their children as food for the Minotaur. After Theseus had come from Troezene, and had learned what a calamity afflicted the state, of his own accord he promised to go against the Minotaur ... When Theseus came to Crete, Ariadne, Minos' daughter, loved him so much that she betrayed her brother and saved the stranger, or she showed Theseus the way out of the Labyrinth. When Theseus had entered and killed the Minotaur, by Ariadne's advise he got out by unwinding the thread. Ariadne, because she had been loyal to him, he took away, intending to marry her. -Hyginus Fabulae 40-43 211 APPENDIX 2 Notes from the Spirit Matters Conference, 2004, Toronto, Canada I reproduce my impressions from that event at some length here because the range and diversity of people and ideas and the way in which the dialogue emerged in itself represent the model of a solution, in the image of an incubator/temenos. Speakers and participants from all over, scholars and researchers, theologians and priests, observers and activists from Africa, Latin America, sub-continental India, Turtle Island, Afro-America, internal exiles from white Euro-American mainstream culture, addressed these questions: From where are we now, what is the next step? How do we bring these into being? What is wisdom? How do we pass it on? For Mpambo Multiversity co-founder Paolo Wangoola, wisdom is wisdom such that: when it is exercised, it is so perfect that no human could come up with it, therefore you are possessed by spirits. The problem is, we have debased power to the merely human, and without the wisdom of the gods, we have stupidity in the world. For decisions to be made with the support of the spirit, the community in totality must be considered, including the dead, the yet unborn, the living. African religion, Wangoola added, has \"working gods,\" deities responsible for different things, and if one god does not respond to prayers, another might. The human-divine relationship in African spiritual practice is dynamic: the prayers of Wangoola's colleague Najeem Hammed on behalf of the gathering, in Yoruba language punctuated with percussion, were compelling. As if listening in on an argument, I found myself nodding and saying, \"That's right! You tell him!\" without knowing a word of Yoruba. Laara Fitznor, an OISE professor and member of the Cree nation, similarly interacts with wisdom-carrying entities, envisioning elders with eagle feathers in the auditorium, because \"We can't be co-creators alone.\" Her way of bringing spiritual awareness into the academy is to draw on her visions of what a student needs next: \"In oral tradition, what needs to be said, will be said. Medicine wheel teaching is flat, not hierarchical.\" John Mohawk, an academic at SUNY (Buffalo) from the Six Nations Confederacy, described this as having 212 a way of life, not a religion. Our ceremonies, which look like religion to you, are celebrations, acknowledgements, respect and thanksgiving for relationship. You have to have the things which are the context of a way of life, the rocks, plants, animals \u2014the neighbourhood\u2014 in order to pass on a way of life. What is human cultural legacy, what wisdom can we pass on, if we no longer have the knowledge to survive? Theologian Mary Evelyn Tucker, arriving that morning from \"a whole other world, the one that is running things\u2014the Science and Policy conference in Washington D.C., where the presentations were about surveillance, exclusivity, nano-tech applications\"\u2014proposes a new contract with society around \"people-based science.\" An encounter with a student who asked, \"Why should I care?\" about the loss of species, underlined for her that the challenge was to bridge these worlds, to connect with and respond to that \"enclosure of despair,\" greed, paralysis, and denial. Tucker believes that we are in a transition state to \"a new, sacred form of consciousness, in need of a new language with which to construct a holistic, cosmologically grounded, organic view, from principles to strategy to tactics to other levels of intersection.\" This new social contract must be \"comprehensive but comprehensible, cohesive and convincing, with commitment and compassion, which is our deepest and best passion, commitment to life itself, our deepest self, evoking deep life energy.\" Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of the journal Tikkun, spoke of the \"globalisation of selfishness,\" and the need for spirituality to \"come out of the closet.\" Not a coercive spirituality, he emphasised, but an emancipatory one, a spiritual politics beyond the polarity of left and right wing ideologies. We need a new definition of productivity, efficiency, and rationality, a new \"bottom line,\" such that not just profit is calculated, but \"the degree to which any initiative maximizes sensitivity to ecology, compassion, ethics, and our ability to respond to the universe with awe. Our interests must no longer be in conflict with our values.\" For these reasons, he said, we must make ourselves visible to each other. Radical theologian Matthew Fox spoke of our assignment to reinvent our species, its ' education system \u2014\"Do the schools provide cosmological education for all our teachers, administrators, students?\"\u2014 our politics, economics, our mindsets. It is the dark night of the soul for the species, he said: we are on the via negativa, heeding a call to stillness that we may honour our capacity as a species for compassion\u2014both joy and grief\u2014 and our need to grieve together our stories of cultural and ecological loss, ritual work, necessary to form 213 community. Moving on to the via creativa, Fox explained the connection between human creativity and Divinity, underscoring our capacity for creativity for evil: The opposite of evil is the sacred. If we are not in touch with our capacity for creativity, we are unable to discern our acts of evil. Creativity is for divine or demonic use. Creativity without the guilt of competing with god\u2014 dancing with God and with the demons needs responsibility. It's easier to feel guilty than to create and take on the demons (and the stonings). This is why we are so afraid of divinity in ourselves and the other. Creativity in the service of compassion is how Fox defines moral imagination. Three essentials of his proposed revolution in education are cosmology, to know who and where we are; creativity; and its director, compassion. '*' 147 : . : . . . : These are major components in the graduate curriculum of Wisdom University, of which Fox is founder and President Emeritus. This institution developed from the University of Creation Spirituality, the school Fox founded in Oakland, California in affiliation with the Naropa Institute. Fox developed the curriculum in Creation Spirituality at Holy Names College in Oakland. Much effort went into defending it from attempts to shut it down by the Roman Catholic Church's Defender of the Faith (an office formerly known as Grand Inquisitor) at the time, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict. http://www. wisdomuniversity.org/home.html 214 APPENDIX 3 Artist's statement: Collage and the multivocal in image-based research As the template of a unitary self gives way to the possibility of a multiplicity of selves, the development of personal identity increasingly takes place in an environment of shifting surfaces and conflicting allegiances. Each experience in relation to this fluctuating Otherness adds to the provisional coalescence of self, but how do we record, interpret and express these events without betraying their multi-vocal potential? At risk of going unheard is the body as site of perceptual experience and source of data: the tension of withholding judgment and maintaining uncertainty in the face of exploratory aporia is easily misconstrued as dis-ease rather than receptivity. Memory is connected with place and embedded in the body's tissues in a gradual process of sedimentation: one feels the resistance and then breakthrough of buried memory as a tectonic shift, an earthquake provoked by massive external forces or persistent seepage. The new landscape requires new maps. But the resurgence of an earlier layer of experience is disruptive and challenging: Hockney warns of \"Stalinist collage,\" where the politically embarrassing are seamlessly eliminated in the official version, parallel with the psychological process of denial (1988, p. 166). Conscious perception is \"a risk... a venture into the unknown, for as it assimilates the present to the past it also brings about some reconstruction of that past...the conscious adjustment of the new and the old is imagination...[unless] inertia of habit overrides adaptation of meaning\" (Dewey, 1934, p.272). As a component in the construction of consensual reality, the photograph as \"received knowledge\" in news journalism, studio portrait, social documentary and family snapshot makes truth claims against memory and collective history. But these lived-through continuities are vulnerable: \"whereas remembered images are the residue of continuous experience, a photograph isolates the appearances of a disconnected instance,\" requiring the viewer to supply an \"appropriate past and future\" (Berger & Mohr, 1982, p. 89). Ripping literally and figuratively into the photograph as object ruptures the smooth surface of assigned meaning: the ripped edge calls out for the missing context, opening up a place for dialogue among the fragments. Juxtaposing other media such as tissue paper and paint brings 215 the rich personal vocabularies of line, colour, texture, and shape to contest the validity and authority of photography, while the layering and torn edges confront photography's ambiguity of meaning. In the negotiation stage of collage, flotsam and flux continue until some combination mysteriously aligns into a significant and articulate relationship to which the artist can make a commitment. Over time, in meditation with the finished object, memory is evoked, connections are noted and the continuity-thread of personal narrative becomes clear. As an act of world-making, collage as process and product can be seen as political, moving from the critically deconstructive to a reconstructive position inclusive of the emergent. 216 APPENDIX 4 Layout of the nave at Chartres Cathedral This figure was bounded by the distance between the high altar and the labyrinth one way, and the walls of the transepts in the other, below. This initial form of one large diamond bounded by two smaller ones was not an accidental shape, but filled with meaning. Where trinitarian designs have been noted with three equal triangles, this church was dedicated to the Virgin, who was usually represented flanked by two angels. This may be why a modified tripartite scheme was used to set out her home.'\" LABYRINTH - RONDPOINT Derived from George Lesser's original, this diagram shows the location of the labyrinth at the west end of the cathedral within a dodecaid layout, and the ratios between the squares and octagons.

The pitch circle is divided in 24 parts and circles with a EC) '| this same radius are drawn from the 24 points, forming the Nyy (#1 design. Standard procedure was to clip outer crowded edge, 3 and replace the central knots of lines with a figurative roundel 4 and draw radiating rings to bisect the curvaceous diamonds formed by the 24 intersecting circles.'\"\" The Medici Rosette Located beneath the desks holding the Bibles on the east side and Greek Metaphysicians on the west, the Medici Panel advances all the steps of construction of the antique rosette. A circle is placed onto a 12:13 rectangle so that its circumference touches the four a #3 ~=s corners, the generating pitch circle then becomes 1/4 of the diagonal of the rectangle. This clever solution permits the complete design to be present in the four corners of the panel, but the rectangular frame cuts away the unsightly edges that were problematic in the antique design and had to be snipped away around the perimeter. The second finesse involves the curving white bands, which open up new spaces unseen in the antique solution. They measure 4/13th of each 24th part of the pitch circle: this prompts a curious mathematical conundrum because the arc of a circle cannot be divided into uneven parts using geometry (note 29*). This component of the design questions known geometric construction methods of the time. *note 29 The only known method is to wrap a flexible measuring stick round the circumference, straighten the stick and subdivide, unwrap the stick and transfer the divisions onto the arc. Nicholson, B. (1997) \"Under Foot and Between the Boards in the Laurentian Library.\" '*? Rotating a circle round a line tangent to it creates a torus. The surface of the torus can be covered with seven distinct areas, all of which touch each other. The classic \"map problem\" is to find a map where the feast number of unique colours are needed. These 3-D examples requires seven colours, meaning that the torus has a high degree of \"communication\" across its surface: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Torus.html and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TorusColoring.html 218 APPENDIX 6 Search for proof of Critchlow's 13-point star by the slightly initiated: details One method is to begin with the division of the diameter (or any straight line) into equal segments by constructing parallel lines, like this: Using the diameter as radius and the intersections with the circumference as points, create two intersecting arcs outside the circle. A line from this point passing through the second division mark of the thirteen on the diameter, if extended, will cut the circumference into a segment of one thirteenth, from the nearest intersection of the diameter and circumference. This chord can be stepped around the circumference, resulting in division into thirteen. Division of the Line into thirteen equal segments. Another way to get such an approximation is to use one eighth of the diameter, stepping that length around the circumference twenty-six times.'\u00b0 That seemed closer, as far as authenticity of approach: the one eighth diameter interval translated into twenty-sixths with supernatural (supra-?) ease. But stepping it round the circumference is awkward. Stepping the 1/8 diameter round the circumference 'S\u00b0 Circumference = Diameter x a, then C/8 = x D/8.

Rosenstiehl is a mathematician who publishes prolifically in the areas of graph theory, plane convexity and distortion, and computer science (Math Subject Classification areas 05, 06, 51, 52, 68). As the director of the Atelier de Taxiplanie at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris IV, he oversees teams of researchers investigating the topology of graph configurations for a variety of applications, such as wiring layouts, printed circuitry, colour mixing and image fidelity, computer graphics, and rigidity in mechanical structures. Software developments arising from this research include automatic schematics, graph partitioning, symmetry detection and realisation, and automatic theorem verification. Collaborative partnerships with industries such as the electrical engineering department of Dassault Aviation and the Laboratoire Cerveau-Cognition take the research into diverse applications. Four papers drawn from Rosenstiehl's work bearing on the analysis of the cathedral labyrinth layout are discussed here: \"Labyrinthologie Math\u00e9matique\" (1971), \"Les of Jerusalem' in Chartres Separates Birds from Fishes\" (1985). Over the course of these papers, he develops procedures for navigating through the labyrinth, at first concentrating on it generically as a curved closed line involving crosspoints, and later charting the specifically unicursal layout as a schematic diagram concerned primarily with the structure underlying the relationship of binary turn sequences. Both \"Les Mots\" and \"La Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale\" expand the analysis to research theory, the former comparing search methods and social structure, the latter, to interdisciplinary cooperation. While \"The Path\" returns to the technical format of \"Labyrinthologie,\" its use of imagery transcends the limits of the profession as does the context, a symposium on the art and science of M.C. Escher, in a manner anticipated in the two earlier papers. The development in Rosenstiehl's thinking and particularly his use of language in this body of work appears to have been influenced by the structuralist movement of the fifties and sixties, especially the ideas of Roland Barthes, who applied to many other fields that model of linguistics which assumes a deep underlying structure to all human activity and communication. 225 Barthes' translator, Annette Lavers, describes the challenge she faced: \"The style reveals a quasi-technical use of certain terms in an effort to account for the phenomenon of mass culture by resorting to new models. Foremost is linguistics, whose mark is seen not so much in the use of specialized vocabulary as in the extension to other fields of words normally reserved for speech or writing.\"'*' Thus the connotations of the original field are brought to the new one by the use of specific words, and this is certainly part of the adventure of following the subtlety in Rosenstiehl!'s thought. When he speaks of a network (reseau), for example, it could be an electronic circuit or equally a group of colleagues; he pivots easily between the naming of parts within mathematical convention, their visual representation, the written word to signify them, and the metaphorical implications of the entire \"sign\". Even his use of the word \"mots\" and \"concatenation\" rather than \"paroles\" and \"phrase\" or \"sentence\" comes loaded with implications and external references. One senses his desire for dialogue, and indeed in both \"Les Mots\" and \"La Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale\" that issue is addressed. To watch this unfolding from the highly technical field of graph theory, by means of visual and linguistic metaphor, to encompass and indeed formulate a general philosophy of research is to witness an integrative and integrated approach to cross-disciplinary work. That Rosenstiehl does so upon the vehicle of the labyrinth is intriguing. A brief overview of the related fields of linguistics and semiotics provides some context here. Roland Barthes (1915-1980) was a widely influential French literary critic who developed and systematised the theory of linguistic signs first conceived by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913), the Swiss linguist and founder of modern structuralist (or descriptive) linguistics. Based on an understanding of language as a systematic structure linking thought and sound, Saussure had established that the relationship of the linguistic sign to that which it signifies is arbitrary, and thus a function of cultural convention, not of nature. This means that language is essentially a self-contained system of signs, each element meaningless except in relation to and as differentiated from the other elements in the system. The American linguist Noam Chomsky's theory, first proposed in 1957, positing innate structures rather than minimal sounds as the basis for speech, established what is known as the transformational - generative school of linguistics, which attempts to define rules that can 'S1A. Lavers, Translator's Note, in Mythologies (London: Collins, 1988), p. 7. 226 generate the infinite number of grammatical (well-formed) sentences possible in a language. It starts not from a behaviourist analysis of minimal sounds but from a rationalist assumption that a deep structure underlies a language, and that a similar deep structure underlies all languages. Transformational grammar attempts to identify rules (\"transformations,\" a word of equal significance in tiling theory) that govern relations between parts of a sentence, on the assumption that beneath such aspects of word order a fundamental structure exists. This structuralist model of language has been applied to various areas of cultural study and systems of classification. Claude Levi-Strauss, the Belgian anthropologist, sees human behaviour as a system of communication. By comparing the formal relationships between elements (e.g. mythologies and cosmologies) across cultures, he has found structural similarities in the patterns created by apparently disparate groups. Joseph Campbell has likewise identified a universal theme and pattern, the narrative of the hero's quest, in his exhaustive study of world mythologies. Roland Barthes expanded on Saussure's original distinction between the /angue, the state of a language at a given time, and the parole, the speech of an individual. In the langue, according to Barthes' view of Saussure, the \"signified\" is the concept, the \"signifier\" is the acoustic image (which is mental) and the relationship between concept and image is the \"sign\" (the word, for instance), which is a concrete entity (1988, p. 113). Barthes describes this relation of signifier and signified as being between objects of different categories, and thus one of equivalence and not equality. He further defines all kinds of meaning-laden objects as \"words\" inasmuch as they carry significance beyond the superficial according to the dynamics of semiology, and are tokens of communication. Thus, in his description of the gift of a bouquet of roses, the roses signify passion, the roses are \"passionified\"; both the roses and the passion, termed the signifier and the signified, have an existence previous to their current state as the third term, the sign. He differentiates between the roses \"experienced\" by the observer as a message, and the roses analysed as signifier distinct from sign. The signifier is empty, Barthes says, but the sign is full, it is a meaning. Barthes further develops a \"second-order semiological system\" to encompass what he refers to as \"myth.\" It is worth looking at this system, illustrated in the accompanying diagram (p. 115), because this is the context that Rosenstieh! refers to when he uses the terms \"word,\" \"language,\" and \"myth\" in both of the Coll\u00e9ge du France papers. When Barthes says 227 the tri-dimensional pattern (signifier, signified, sign) operates only to decipher, being about form rather than content and thus actualized in different ways, one can see the outlines in Rosenstiehl's search for the underlying structure of the search itself, as well as of the superficial terrain: the logic of equating Ariadne's brief words of instruction to Theseus with algorithms, the extrapolation of her Thread to networks of communication, the pattern of the markers of patterns. Most clearly this is suggested in Rosenstiehl's use of the term \"word,\" because this derives directly from Saussure, and refers to the \"sign,\" the third term. 1. Signifier 2. Signified Language 3. Sign MYTH I. SIGNIFIER Il. SIGNIFIED HI. SIGN First and second order semiological systems...\"the spatialization is... only a metaphor\" In Barthes' second-order system, the sign, the total of the signifier/signified relationship, becomes a signifier at the second level, that of myth. Because myth uses as material, according to Barthes, all classes of things - photography, ritual, art, gestures, language - inasmuch as these come laden with ascribed cultural meaning, they are used as signifying entities, as \"global\" signs, they are \"language-objects.\" Barthes gives the example of the photograph on a magazine cover of a black soldier in a French uniform, saluting, eyes raised, presumably, to the French flag. Barthes says that is the meaning of the picture. But what is signified is the greatness of the French Empire, that all Frenchmen regardless of colour are proud to serve in her defense, and that France can reject the accusation that she oppresses her colonial subjects. At the mythical, or second-order level, the final sign of the first, language- object system, the black soldier saluting the French flag (= noble, unoppressed colonial) becomes the signifier of the second, and what is signified is a mixture of Frenchness and militariness. So the sign, the final term of the first system, at the level of language, Barthes calls meaning. This same term, at the level of myth, becomes form. At both levels, the signified is the concept. The final term of the mythical level, he calls signification, justifying the term by the dual function of myth: \"it points out and it notifies, it makes us understand something and it imposes it on us\" (pp.116-117). 228 Having laid out the terminology, Barthes can then describe the dynamic interaction between the two levels: there is much ambiguity. While the meaning of the sign is complete and self-sufficient (the black soldier is an individual with a biography and a country of origin), at a mythic level it becomes empty, the biography of the soldier must be put in parentheses if the picture is to receive the wealth of meaning signified conceptually. Barthes emphasizes here the impoverishment of the meaning by the form: \"the meaning loses its value but keeps its life\" which the form of the myth draws upon, a reserve of history and riches. The form of the myth \"hides\" in the meaning: the black soldier saluting is not a symbol, he is too \"rich...innocent...indisputable,\" but his presence is transparent, and becomes the \"accomplice\" of the concept of French imperialism, thus artificial. Barthes provides the similar example of the diamond ring; at once a crystalline mineral and potentially a machine tool, the meaning of the stone at a mythic level is stripped and reloaded with the concept of \"true gift of eternal love,\" to the benefit of the diamond industry, and the great short-circuiting of the complexity of marital relations. An analysis of the qualities of the myth completes the necessary lexicon (though by no means does any justice to the subtleties of the theory): the third term is the association of the first two, the mythic form and the mythic concept, and both are manifest, not latent. In visual (and presumably ritual and gestural) myth, as opposed to oral, the elements of form are spatial (the layout of the black soldier's picture on the page, the lines of the labyrinth on the floor) while the concept is \"memorial...a hazy condensation of a certain knowledge.\" The concept distorts the form: the soldier is deprived of biography, the pattern of lines on the floor becomes an initiation. But the form is at the same time the meaning of the first order sign, and Barthes describes this alternation as a turnstile, the point of departure constituted by the arrival of meaning. The process of alternation between meaning and form Barthes compares to sitting in a car looking at the scenery, focusing either on the glass and the distance of the landscape, or the transparency of the window and the depth of the long view, so that the window is at once present and empty, and the landscape unreal and full, like the mythic signifier, whose form is empty and present, and sign/meaning unreal and full. To stop the spinning of the turnstile of form and meaning, Barthes says one must \"apply to myth a static method of deciphering...go against its own dynamics.\" It will be clear from the 229 following analysis of Rosenstiehl's work on the labyrinth that that is exactly what he has undertaken to do. Labyrinthologie Math\u00e9matique is a dense technical paper concerning the implementation of the algorithmic theorems of Tarry, Hamilton, Tr\u00e9maux and Euler when transversing graph planes, depending on whether or not one wants to cross the same point more than once, if at all. Analogs of this situation are \"the taxi round Paris, visiting all the gates,\" and \"getting the postman back to the post office.\" An example of the application of this problem is found in parallel process programming in computer engineering when setting up nodes for searches, whether \"depth-first\" or \"breadth-first.\" Each node has valences of pathways connected to it, which may or may not lead to the goal node. The difference in search method can be visualised as the circumnavigating of a polygon (breadth-first: all the gates of the city) or going down each of the branches of a tree (depth-first: the postman). The relevance of this distinction will be evident to anyone who has surfaced after an eternity on a search engine in the Web. Rosenstiehl states at the outset the two imperatives of a formal systematic \"assault\" on the mathematical labyrinth: economic exploration, and limited means, achievable through judicious use of graph algorithms, general research procedures, and a structuring of data. His intention is to identify a set of finite automata that could be used at the crosspoints, without regard to the dimensions of the space, such that a circuit could be created of the shortest route between the points without cycling back on any single line between points, and addressing the restriction of crossing or not crossing at the junctions. These automata relate only to themselves and the neighboring nodes of the network: Rosenstiehl compares them to biological, sociological, and technological networks which have the appearance of organic coherence when they are in fact regional developments.'\" He sees the dual aspect of the solution to the labyrinth: on the one hand, to find a route through the maze of routes such that one can retrace one's steps,'\" and on the other, to define the parameters of automata that can construct such a route, usable both for a single 'S? This reference to global and local operations is a technical term specific to plane division, tiling, and tesseration in Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical topology, relating to transformative properties of the various groups of operations. '3 Described as technically a fl\u00e9che (arrow, spire) of a groupoid, a \"word\" in the \"language\" of Dyck. 230 mechanism \"in the centralised mode habitual to classic algorithms\" and also to those dispersed throughout any labyrinth to be solved. His approach is to treat the whole problem as a tree, using the image of Ariadne's Thread, and the cyclings back from the tips of the branches he identifies with letters such that each return (\"replies\") to a node is identified using the letter and its inverse indicated as prime: a a', b b'. The collection of the words thus formed can be thought of as parenthesised for the purpose of both simplification and for localizing an area of operations. Thus in a sequence, or word, when two letters are not contiguous, the letters in between signal a departure along one or more paths, and this \"isthmus\" is always characterised by the doubling of each letter within the parenthesis. Using this system, decisions regarding procedures at crosspoints and junctures can be made. The article, written for mathematicians, goes on at length and in depth on the implications for a variety of problems both classical and more recent, by comparing outcomes such as erasures of isthmuses (mots vides), crossings, knots, and closed loops that arise from applying the theoretical approaches mentioned earlier. The idea germane to the analysis of the unicursal Chartres labyrinth is sufficiently outlined here. The next two articles, \"Les Mots du Labyrinthe\"' and \"La Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale,\" were presented at the Roland Barthes seminars on The Labyrinth as Metaphor for Interdisciplinary Research at the Coll\u00e9ge du France, and have consequently a broader range with reference to the critical structuralist context, as one would expect. In \"Les Mots,\" Rosenstiehl translates the working lexicon of the mathematical labyrinth into the metaphorical language of research, describing the labyrinth \"of which each reconstructs a piece of the map by their own efforts\" as being \"for the artisans of science the archetype of the field of research, and the beating of the bushes, the spirit of research.\" He offers four observations on the labyrinth: \u00b0 the labyrinth is extricable (and he could help shorten it) . the labyrinth is a grammar, and Ariadne had parenthesised there \u00b0 the labyrinth is a myopic algorithm \u00b0 the labyrinth is an \"'a-centred\" universe. '4 An earlier version of \"Les Mots\" was presented at the Colloque sur la Theorie des Graphes in Brussels in 1973, and published in the Cahiers Centre Etudes Recherches Op\u00e9r. 15 (1973), pp.245-252. It concerns the properties of \"walks on a graph,\" described by R.C. Read in the Math Review as \"a word each letter of which denotes an edge in one or another of its possible orientations.\" 231 Rosenstichl's primary concern is to develop a theory for maze threading (he uses the word battre throughout, meaning the beating of bushes to flush gamebirds) from which may be derived rules and procedures - that is the role of theory. He is condescending towards \"architects and mystics\" who insist on bumbling blindly towards the center. Strategy is essential in any labyrinth, and while it is human nature to create labyrinths both mental and concrete, mythology provides us with strategies to overcome our \"myopia\" as well as our monsters. Even the master-builder Daedelus had to resort to tricks to escape his own creation. Rosenstiehl describes the algorithmic theorems of Tarry (1895) and Tr\u00e9maux (1882) as seminal, \"highly distilled, in the language of the period,\" but obscure: a combinatory artifact by which to escape, but awaiting the theoretical concepts developed more recently in the field of algebra, in order to become accessible as tools. Algebra reveals structures, including that of Theseus' wandering through the labyrinth. This has been transcribed into a formal language, \"/'Alg\u00e9bre des grammaires g\u00e9n\u00e9ratives,\" with notations for word forms and syntax, and thus a subject of interest for the structural theorists at the Barthes seminars. He notes his own response to the labyrinthine set-up of the seminar, both the site and all the presentations: \"T have followed, and sometimes I have not followed... the Daedelus of the seminar, ...the signs sending one to the others, ...my desire to deconstruct...to abstract,\" pointing out the distinction between critical and mathematical language in the use of metaphor. Barthes is quoted: \"the theory continually recuperates,\" and so Rosenstiehl will \"recuperate\" the word labyrinth, but only for the purpose of the presentation, as it is left by the wayside in mathematical terminology. To lead the audience through the concept of \"extricability,\" Rosenstiehl introduces a schematic view of space: a labyrinth is made up of corridors incident at both ends to a crossroad. A crossroad incident to a single corridor is a cul-de-sac. A corridor incident by both ends to a single crossroad is a loop. A large column in a hall constitutes a loop incident to a crossroad-hall, by which the traveller tours the column. Subways, escalators, moving sidewalks are corridors. The form of crossroads incident to corridors, points and lines, is a graph, or network. But all graphs are not labyrinths; rather, it is the degree of what Rosenstiehi calis \"myopia\" in the traveller, the limiting of calculations to the local operation, that makes a labyrinth. 232 One needs to be familiar with two extreme graph forms: the polygon, equal numbers of points and lines alternating (the gates and boundary boulevards of Paris), and the tree, more lines than points, the presence of culs-de-sacs, no polygons. The \"beating\" of either sort involves the rule that in any crossroad except for the first by which one initiated the journey, the corridor of discovery of that crossroad is not taken except as a last resort. In this way, economy of means is attained, because one only goes once in each direction on any corridor. Rosenstieh] then says that any graph, or labyrinth, is a combination of the two, and that supplementary lines connect the tips of the tree, the culs-de sac, forming polygons, thus constituting a connected finite labyrinth. It was the discovery of Tarry that the labyrinth limits itself by the same rule of not using the corridor of discovery except on final retreat, that is, that the point of arrival is the same as the point of departure. Rosenstiehl dismisses the \"always turn left\" or \"always keep one's right hand on the wall\" techniques as \"scanty geometric props\" suitable only for extremely limited situations and completely useless in the abstract labyrinth of information systems, both social and technological. In support he offers a cautionary reference to Borges' Library of Babel, and later, in The Path, an amusing drawing of the truncated schematic of the unicursal cathedral labyrinth using such a method. He further illustrates Tarry's rule (\"the minimal order, necessary and sufficient\") by opening a sequence of parentheses on order and liberty, exploration in each era of newly accessible parts of the labyrinths of mathematics, what this means for creativity, the activity of the cubists all painting the same subject with such varied results, the narrow-mindedness of imposed academic method, and the interchangeability of \" (a)maze\" and \"astonishment\" and \"maze\" and \"labyrinth\" in English, before neatly closing all the digressions, making his point to the structuralists, and segueing gracefully to the subject of grammar. Rosenstiehl introduces the algebraic grammar developed by Schiitzenberg and Chomsky.'\" It is impossible to say whose was the greater debt in this exchange. The familiar letters are strung together to form words: a passage down a corridor is labelled a, the inverse direction a'. The \"prime\" operator is the return, and 'S\u00b0 Rosenstieh! notes that this is technically known as a monoid, an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation, i.e. addition and multiplication, for which there exists a left and right identity element, called the unit of the monoid. The example given is: the set of integers considered only with regard to the binary operation of addition, has unit 0. (Integers, addition, 0) forms a monoid, as does (real numbers, multiplication, 1). Frequently used in algebraic geometry, the associative quality can be manipulated to eliminate repeated operations and simplify topographical} notation. 233 aa'=a'a. (aa'a, a,aa'aa' is groping about blindly in the same corridor). Three corridors in a row and the return, aj \u00a2 t'j' a', is called a concatenation, which one may do freely, or subject to the rules of grammar which accepts some words and constructions and rejects others. The Chomskyan concept of \"context free\" grammar is illustrated by the example of a string of one-directional corridors \u00ab& concatenating with another 8 to form the word a B, but only if the last letter of @ accords with the grammar governing its concatenation with the first letter of B. The rest of the letters are context and of no concern: \"depending on where you come from, you can continue. And myopia is permitted.\" Concatenation can be seen as parenthesising, like smaller branches on a larger limb, the distance between a letter incongruent with its prime indicating the complexity of routing. Here Rosenstiehl illustrates with Theseus arriving back at the entry point to return his end of the string to Ariadne: when she pulls them together the labyrinth is \"annulled,\" the string, unknotted, parenthesises Theseus. The critical choice is whether to close the last parenthesis opened or carry on and open a new one. Here Rosenstiehl distinguishes between Foolish and Wise Ariadne as search techniques. The Foolish goes on opening parentheses, until there are none left, then rewinds the string, retraces the steps, and closes the parentheses in sequence. This is the most economical of directives, one of the two primary rules stated at the outset in Labyrinthologie. The Wise would rewind as one proceeds, that is, closes the last one opened, does not enter a crossroad previously discovered, but otherwise explores new corridors. Both adhere to Tarry's avoidance of the corridor of discovery, and fulfil the requirements of . parenthesage. Depending on the nature of the search, each has advantages and disadvantages to the characteristics of their particular translation of the labyrinth structure. In the section on myopic algorithm, Rosenstiehl discusses at length the nature of the signs \"posted\" at the crossroads. A subject first introduced in Labyrinthologie, where the information required of the automata included the shortest path between two points, maximal arboricity, and the existence of circuits, eulerian and hamiltonian cycles, here the distribution of signs among \"beatings\" according to the rules of Tarry, Foolish, and Wise Ariadne are illustrated and compared. Signs indicate whether a corridor has been explored (the absence of a sign is a sign) and if it is the corridor of discovery and thus to be avoided until final departure. Tarry's rule requires both of these signs, and the two Ariadnes are a class of Tarry's, though Foolish Ariadne requires the further signing to indicate from which corridor 234 to which corridor her Thread runs at a given crossroad. The signs are only \"legible\" at the ends of the corridors, thus constituting \"myopia\"\u2014 one cannot see what is posted at the other end of the corridor. If an algorithm is a procedure which directs a calculation and produces a result, then a myopic algorithm is one which operates identically all over a field but is aware only of the information available locally, exactly like a traveller in a labyrinth. Thus, according to Rosenstiehl, Tarry's rule is a myopic algorithm. As most algorithms for path- threading on a graph have general information available to them (the big picture), most are not myopic, and do not belong on labyrinths, but most graphs are not labyrinths. An example of a myopic algorithm successful in a non-labyrinth situation, however, is that of the solution Rosenstiehl proposes to the famous March of the Knight on the Chessboard problem, where each square must be visited but once: place the knight each time in a square where he dominates the smallest number of squares not already visited. He points out that the myopia here extends to two corridors, and that the knight himself is a little myopic. Rosenstiehl concludes \"Les Mots\" by generalising the concept of myopia to technological and social information networks, the \"acentric universe.\" Though the dimensions of the labyrinth can be defined as the number of crossroads, and the complexity as the number of signs,'** nevertheless the rule is universally applied according to local intelligence available, independent of dimension. Each crossroad is a finite automata posting a statement concerning its condition, and communicating this statement along the corridors to its neighbours on a regular basis, until such time as the conditions no longer change and the calculation, now completed, is terminated with a final statement which is the record of the \"beating,\" or search. This final statement, Rosenstiehl suggests, is a hapax'\"' (a technical term in linguistics: hapax legomenon, plural legomena) a word spoken only once. He gives an example of a 'SSimilar to Fisher's \"span-square: an imaginary square measured along the length of a path, based on the maze's span unit (e.g. centre-line to centre-line in a pavement labyrinth). The number of span-squares containing nodes can be expressed as a percentage of the total number of span-squares in a maze. This is one useful way to evaluate the difficulty ofa maze.\" Fisher, p. 9. 'From 'amhov (Greek): simple, single. No Latin transitional word found to the possibly related happer (Old French): to snatch, seize, with the beak (v. tr). The English words based on hap (happy, hapless &c.) originate in Old Norse Aapp: good luck, and Middle English happenen: to occur (v. intr.). The lips referred to further on would be blue from pecking, presumably. 235 possible collective hapax: we all show up next Saturday with blue lips, the sign for this would be unique, used only once. But his planning of the event has transgressed the definition, which includes the condition of a-centric. All the friends (the automata) in the network habitually talk (exchange signs) once a week, not keeping track of the number of conversations (signs) or the number of friends (automata) as this would be beyond their capacity. The sign reserved for the hapax is posted in unison by each and every one of the friends (junctions, automata) as the final statement of condition (We're all showing up Saturday with blue lips!), The theorem of the collective hapax sounds like a Hundredth Monkey scenario, a change of state when critical mass is reached in social organisations: Theorem of the collective hapax: An automata exists for new signs by the junction, of which any number of copies (as large as one wants), arranged by their junctions in any connected labyrinth, are able to effect, upon the initiative of any one among them, a collective hapax. Rosenstiehl compares this phenomenon to the collective agreement of bees to swarm and concludes that the centre of decision is not located in the spatial, in the hexagons of wax evoked by Borges' description of the labyrinth-library \"sphere of which the true centre is some sort of hexagon, and of which the circumference is inaccessible,\" but rather in bee- communication itself. Acentrism is characteristic of \"ant-hill\" societies, and the network of finite automata in human communication systems, whether biological or technological, is the spontaneous emergence of this, in spite of the historical imposition of hierarchy upon language, concept, and social organisation. He closes by emphasising that the abstraction of the labyrinth gives hope to the emergence of the acentred as a language. Several levels of interpretation are possible here: a strictly technical application of theory to the problem of the labyrinth as architectural site, an algorithm for the search thread in the computerized graph environment, a schematic of the larger abstract environment of communication technology networks, and ultimately, a metaphor for social organisation, whether beehive or interdisciplinary research seminar. Following the basic tenet of structuralist theory, Rosenstiehl searches for the structure underlying the patterns revealed at each level of analysis, keeping in mind, as he focuses like a microscope at different magnifications, that the organism remains the same no matter how different it may appear. 236 Given his commitment to interdisciplinary work, it is fascinating to read the lists and abstracts of the projects on which he has collaborated, particularly in the areas of neural networks and visual perception. Is there an internal hapax of synapses? An algorithm of political will ? A mathematics of collective action ? Scanning the index of La revue Math\u00e9matiques, Informatiques et Sciences Humains, the publication of the Centre d'Analyse et de Math\u00e9matiques Sociales which Rosenstiehl directs, one would think that if there is, these people will find it. It is with anticipation that one turns to Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale, the second of the Barthes seminar papers. The emphasis here is very different, on two counts. The first is that Barthes had died the previous year, and the tone of the paper is mournful, elegiac, quite unlike the joking and camaraderie of \"Les Mots.\" The second factor is that the technical content of the paper is completely concerned with the unicursal pavement labyrinth, so the now familiar tools of parenthesage are brought to bear on a specific architectural array. Having developed the theory in the abstract and general, the procedure is now used on the particular with significant results. The combination of factors, however, gives the impression of two different papers cobbled together: although the introduction to the historical and experienced labyrinth employs the techniques and vocabulary of structuralist analysis, the closing section, on Barthes' heuristics and the essay The Winter Garden Photograph, seems to be an addendum. Nevertheless, the developments in both structuralist and mathematical analysis of the labyrinth are substantial, as Rosenstiehl addresses the metaphor of the \"concrete\" sign. The essay opens with a description of the octagonal black and white pavement construction in the parish church of St. Quentin. Right away the language locates the action in the world of experience, not theory: \"the black motif unravels like wool\"... \"traps itself within multiple jaws it \"escapes as if by magic trail...is not a trap.\" To obtain proof, there is nothing to be done but \"throw oneself bodily into the ...unpredictable volutes\" and even then it remains questionable whether one has covered the entire course\u2014experience alone does not provide an infallible map of the \"Path to Jerusalem.\" The historical background provides little explanation. The builders left few records of either their intentions or their calculations, and it is unknown how much of this may have 237 been suppressed. Both communal games and solemn rituals of reflection, pilgrimage and penance are said to have taken place upon them. But in the absence of received evidence, all one has to go on is the fact of the pattern on the floor: \"what one may say of it appears simply to be about the form itself...the topical is richer than the general, the denoted richer than the connoted, the literal richer than the symbolic.\" It is not a symbol: unlike the cross, it has no dogma attached, it is \"multivocal,\" a cue for anyone's private unfolding. Nor is it a myth in the structuralist sense of collective agreement on interpretation: the labyrinth serves everyone as \"the geometry of welcome\" for private, spiritual, site-specific events. Nor is it metaphor: it is illogical, there is no connection between the visible signifier-pattern and the signified journey of the soul. Not any of these, but rather, says Rosenstiehl, the labyrinth is \"a method for the arrangement of a multitude of metaphors.\" But there is geometry! By locating the irregularities, one can establish a \"law of alternation\" regulating the sequence of straight runs and opposing turnabouts at the ends of the three semi-axes at the North, East, and South sides of the pattern. The throat, on the West semi-axis where the two ends of the actual path come out in the centre and the entrance, is where \"the labyrinth plays.\" Including these paths of access to centre and exterior as elements, the strands are matched and form turnabouts away from the axis, in a system of paired turnabouts nested within a larger single span, two layers of nests on each side creating the four tiers of the throat, evidence of the \"law of doubling.\" The same form is to be found consistently in all the examples documented or still in existence. How can this be? 238 aN ETToOnfoey\u2014sc0 @e x St. Quentin labyrinth path, threads of the throat matched and labelled (prime not indicated). So LO RO Rosenstieh] uses the concatenation, or parenthesage, method, to demonstrate that the labyrinth layout is the only solution to a system of equations, given the laws of alternation and doubling, and he believes that this was a fact known to the medieval builders. Starting at the exterior of the East semi-axis, one encounters a turnabout, and then, moving towards the centre, an alternation of straight lines and turnabouts. Should one try, at either the North or South sem-axes, to start with a turnabout rather than the existing straight runs, a closed loop would result with the outer turnabout in the East. The arrangements at the three semi-axes are therefore givens, and the only options remain at the throat. Here is Rosenstiehl verbatim on the application of a familiar technique: Italic letters are assigned in the throat to the eleven strands from the NORTH and the eleven from the SOUTH, o to the exterior access, m to the central passage, and identical letters to designate the two ends of the same thread determined by the decisions taken on the three other semi-axes. One thus obtains the two series of threads of the throat: aabbcddeffgg for the threads from the NORTH, hhiiajjckkeo for the threads from the SOUTH. To resolve the equation requires parenthesising the above two words such that: i) matching the letters two by two in the parenthesage creates a single thread running from a to a; 239 ii ) the law of doubling is respected, which signifies that any parenthesis belongs to a complete group of parentheses of height two exactly, which assigns us to one of the five following schemas: 60.) 6.) 6)) CC)) or 66.) 6).) C6) \u00a9).) or C.(.).) CC.).) CE).) or GIGI) oF 0) 0) 0) A systematic analysis reveals finally that for the above words a single parenthesage- solution complies with conditions (i) and (ii ). It concerns the following parenthesage: (a(@b)(be)d)dlef)(fg)g) (A(hi)(ia)j) G(ek)(ke)o) which represents none other, in fact, than the solution of Saint-Quentin. With a little bit more courage one verifies that the alternatives left by the wayside on the three semi-axes do not support any other solution. A priori, 675'** schemas were possible, but only one provides a path that does not cycle back on itself. We will call this the Dodecamaze. Rosenstiehl goes on to examine a \"labyrinth of Solomon\" ina sixteenth century Venetian manuscript with a somewhat different arrangement on d and e, which does not adhere to the law of doubling, and is \"badly drawn.\" He speculates on the possibility of a mathematical law of perfect parenthesage, emphasising its utility in establishing the laws of alternation and doubling that characterise the \"perfect maze in twelve layers.\" As to the mystery of the labyrinth, the reticence of the builders, the transmitted yet unarticulated message of deep devotion to \"canonical entanglement,\" he throws up his hands and leaves it to the historians, before launching into a generalisation on the labyrinthine nature of the thread of research. There he identifies Barthes' use of the phrase \"one can say that...\" as a \"heuristic prefix\" which in contrast to the more scientific \"it must...\" and \"it is therefore necessary...\" invites exploration on unknown terrain. The image he provides is the grappling hook in Andrei Tarovski's The Stalker, thrown each time in a new direction across levels of forbidden territory. His language is vivid and active: \"geometry isolates the pure a 'SThe figure of 675 given for potential alternatives can be factored out to 3 x 5 which represents the three axes and the five sets of pairs on each side remaining if one eliminates the a w pair for which there is no variation possible. 240 configuration,\" \"throws challenges\": \"erratic problems spring up\" (gush forth, fly as sparks: Jaillisent!). Barthes' purpose is the framing of the research question itself, the origin of his angoisse stochastique. The thread can give form to the search but not authority. The conjectural \"it can be said that...\" not only invites discourse but also composes the working formula for the underlying structures, to be found in neighbouring fields given the equivalent vocabulary translations and sometimes generative transforms of the idea entirely, as the Chomsky-Schiiltzenberg collaboration illustrates. (Similar interdisciplinary conceptual transforms can be seen in the field of bio-engineering where the \"haptic community\"'\"'is currently developing applications in psychophysics of human-computer interfaces, Virtual Reality environments for tactile sensing and distance manipulation on a pantographic principle of an activity such as medical surgery, at the neural network level.) The challenge is irresistable: Barthes asks the question and throws out the ball of wool, engaging in the quest the individual and the network. There is an intriguing situation that should be mentioned, before leaving Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale. Investigation reveals that the parenthesage of the cathedral labyrinth, if prime were indicated as in \"Les Mots,\" would result in a string of words clearly articulating (the term choreographing comes to mind) the presence of three identical constructions arranged in the inner, middle, and outermost layers of the labyrinth. These sequences, on e, c, and a respectively are obvious in the labelled circuits described in \"Le Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale\" (see Figure 3). The problems associated with labelling prime in the drawing are also revealed. Because the labyrinth is unicursal, there really are no choices to be made or crossroads requiring them. Elsewhere, in \"Les Mots,\" the labyrinth at Knossos is characterised as a cul-de-sac with two crossroads, the entrance and the centre, incident to a single line. Rosenstieh] has labelled the threads myopically, in relation to the \"local information\" necessary and sufficient to note incidence to the region of the throat, but not the activity of entering and exiting. As the arrangement of runs and turnabouts is predetermined on the North, East, and South semi-axes, then what one is looking for in the throat is the distribution of turnabouts such that looping will be avoided. Like the knight on the chessboard, distance vision is limited, in this case to the first axis out from the throat, except for g g' and h h' (which also '? http://haptic.mech.nwu.edu 241 share the characteristic of being the most extremely situated, in the centre and the exterior circuits | and 11). Thus we can see that a, c, and e are distinct from the other threads in having their other end, or prime, in the opposite side of the throat axis from their point of origin. Picking up the Thread and labelling prime (as a function of location rather than state of discovery or exploration) on a, c, and e would demonstrate some interesting occurrences of symmetry. The following table should help to clarify this issue.

It indicates: * the direction of the turn that begins each step *the quadrant(s) where the movement takes place, numbered one through four clockwise from the lower left so that the direction of movement across quadrants is noted * the letter labelling the segment(s) of the thread or path * the concentric circuit the movement occupies, numbered one through eleven from the centre outwards. 242 * throat segments are labelled T1 through 4 consecutively as they would be encountered on the Thread. T1 is the outer left, T2 the inner left, T3 the outer right, T4 the final avenue to the centre o. With this table it can be seen that e e', cc', and aa' are each five steps, of which three cover two quadrants and the intervening steps only one. Each word moves through all four quadrants and five layers of circuits in the \"enunciation.\" They are separated from one another by one \"empty\" word in each case. The words e e' and a a' begin in the first quadrant and end up in the fourth, unlike c c', but apart from the direction of the originating turn, and the fact that, while the overall movement of the former two is clockwise, that of c c' is counterclockwise, all follow a sequence of right/ left/ right/ left. That is to say, in each case, all aspects of their movement and location in the labyrinth follow the law of alternation established earlier. It is worth recalling that the experience of walking these circuits of varying circumference involves a complex series of decisions about movements and gestures. The process of \"throwing oneself bodily\" into the journey is, as Rosenstiehl points out, more visceral than visual. The number of footsteps required before the sudden halt and negotiation of a turn to the left or to the right is different for each segment, the handedness (footedness rather) of the agent is a factor, as is the choice of foot to lead with when initiating the turn, from a choreographic point of view. It is highly possible that the repetition of these three elements generates some of the meditative, soothing, or trance-like states experienced when walking the labyrinth: as with repeat movements in dance or T'ai Chi, the mind becomes conditioned to the sequence, and sub-consciously recognizes it when it reappears. The dancer's research question would ask about the relationship between the lengths of the arcs of the concentric circuits in a given \"word,\" how many steps difference there is between e e', c c',aa'. What is the underlying rhythm of this movement through space? These are questions which arise from the characteristics of the pavement labyrinth as architectural site-dance floor. But Rosenstiehl leaves behind the Word, and moves on to the pattern at an entirely different plane of magnification. \"How the 'Path of Jerusalem' in Chartres Separates Birds From Fishes\" was presented to an interdisciplinary Congress on the artist M.C. Escher held at the University of Rome in 1985. Organised by the Mathematical, Physical, and Natural Science Faculty, the sections of 243 the congress were divided into Symmetry, Mathematics and Visual Perception, Geometry (where Rosenstiehl presented), Cinema and Computer Graphics, the Physical World, Art, and the Humanities. The publication of the Proceedings is encyclopaedic in its range, providing verifications of earliest possible dates of historical influences'and careful descriptive analyses of comparative classification systems and application procedures\u2014Escher developed his own working system of elements entirely independently and, it would appear, in advance of the academic crystallography field - but Rosenstiehl's contribution is outstanding. Informed by the structuralist practice of searching for the underlying framework in the presenting situation, he uses an austerity of means and a distinctly pragmatic approach to make a conceptual leap of breathtaking inventiveness from the earlier theory of spatial analysis. Taking an action immediately suggestive of the \"acentred\" universe of \"Les Mots,\" he dispenses with the rule of doubling (recall the absence of sign for prime, noted in \"Le Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale\") and, restricted only by the alternation rule, he opens the cathedral labyrinth at the axis of the throat, \"bending\" and \"morphing\" the array into a rectangle, in essence liberating the axes of the labyrinth from their layout radiant from the centre (see figures 4 and 5), while keeping intact the sequence of turns and the relative positions of the opposing turnabouts. Using a visual form of the labyrinth based on the three colour marble labyrinth at the church of Santa Maria in Aquino in Rome, Rosenstiehl maintains the separate identities of the left hand and right hand walls and the path traced between them. Lifting the path out, and cutting off what he perceives to be the \"frame,\" including the throat sections, results in a piece that one can see is part of an infinite array of repeated tiles in two colours. Rosenstiehl concludes his visual presentation by gradually distorting this repeat pattern into a tiling of birds going one way and fish going the other, an \"Escherization.\" Thus, he says, does the path of Jerusalem separate the birds from the fishes, \"the air from the water.\" In one stroke, he has engaged language, history, geometry ancient and algebraic, medieval and late twentieth century cosmologies. The turnstile of form and meaning is a blur. Escher first read P\u00e9lya's article of 1924, on the seventeen crystallographic groups illustrated as symmetry groups of tilings, in 1935, according to Branko Griinbaum, in: M.C. and Science, p. Coxeter introduced Escher to divisions of the hyperbolic plane in 1957. Escher appreciated the illustrations but claimed the \"hocus-pocus text\" of no use to him! Quoted by Doris Schattschneider in the same volume, p. 82. 244 The technical specifications of the transformed labyrinth are detailed extensively. The repeat pattern is based on an elemental unit called a hexomino, a horizontal row of five white squares with a sixth placed on top of the second square. The counterpart, originally grey in the Santa Maria version, is formed by the operation of rotation on the middle top edge of the fourth square. This creates the fundamental region. The text says of the white and its grey counterpart \"both generate the array by repeating the two translations (6, 0) and (-2, 2) and their opposites.\" Some technical context clarifies this. Translation and rotation are terms for two symmetry operations that, performed on the motif, or fundamental region, result in its repetition over the whole plane. This transformation relating two congruent figures is called an isometry; translation and rotation are direct isometries. (Reflection and glide reflection are called opposite isometries because they mirror across an axis.) Symmetry operations include translations in two directions, according to restrictions defined by crystallographic classification: admissible periods for a rotation are 2, 3, 4, and 6. A rotation of 180\u00b0 or half turn, is called two-fold; 90\u00b0 or quarter turn is called four fold; location of point of rotation (e.g. midpoints and vertices) further classify types of tilings. Escher's BIII classification rotation, reverse colour; translation in both diagonal directions; BII classification in that rotation is on two axes rather than four, at midpoints of opposite sides) and the crystallographic system of P2. Shared edges of such tiles are opposite colours, tiles sharing vertices are same coloured (Schattshneider in Coxeter, 1987. p. 87). The fundamental region. Rotation 180\u00b0 at A2 The diagram illustrates rotation at A2, the midpoint of the fourth square, colour reversed. The operation is composed so: Rotation at A2, colour reversing L1LO = rotation 180\u00b0(counterclockwise) LOL1 = rotation 180\u00b0(clockwise) L1L0 =LOL1 245 Translation is a movement in a specific direction, (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) on translation or glide vectors, within clearly defined parameters. - wy Ww FAA yo 10 11 12 13 14 15 Translations (6,0) and (-2,2) and their opposites (0,6) and (2,-2) The path between the walls. N, E, \u00a7 semi-axes indicated. A translation (6, 0) means each unit is being translated, that is repositioned, six places to the right on the X axis, and zero on the Y axis; (-2, 2) means repositioned negative two on the X axis, and two on the Y axis. The same operations done in reverse are written (0, 6)(2, -2), that is, no movement on the X axis and six on the Y, two on the X, negative two on the Y. The whole operation is composed so: A2 C2 LO 180\u00b0 Rotation with Centre C 2 Reflection) 246 (L1L0)(L1L2) =(LOL1)(L1L 2) =LO(L1L1)L2 (associative property) =LOL2 This equation says: on the left side perform the operation of 180\u00b0counterclockwise rotation on L 1 and LO, and then a translation or repositioning from L 1 to L 2. This will equal a similar clockwise rotation (LOL 1) and translation. But L 1 and L 1, now associated (an algebraic property), are identical, and cancel each other out, leaving the equality (L 0 L 2), a 180\u00b0 rotation on point C2. Visually the operation can be represented like this: 180 \u00b0 Rotation with centre C2 - Point Reflection Rosenstiehl calls the resulting pattern the stretched-H array, which generates the turnabouts for the path of the labyrinth. Among the seventeen two-dimensional space groups identified by Federov, that is, the essentially different ways to make \"wallpaper\" patterns using translations, rotations, reflections and glide-reflections, there are a few which generate all the rest: this is the term Rosenstiehl is using. Crystallographic notation classification P2 is one of these, described as half-turns around a point or vertex, and looks the same either way up (Coxeter, 1987, p. 17). The turnabouts of the path which come close to each other in opposite directions \"evokes the class of problems on touch points and cross points of Jordan Curves.\" 247 X= IC\" Jordan Curve Crossing Problem This is related to the parenthesage of lettered corridors mentioned earlier. The crosspoint problem refers to the situation of loops of \"words\" incident to a junction, marked in the diagram as a circled X. One can choose the direction of the path, allowing the loop to become either a discrete form or two curved lines, depending which alternative you choose, as shown. The evocative quality of this notation is particularly apparent in the Chartres type labyrinth with the curved \"labrys\" form of turnabout. Rosenstiehl describes the sequence changing the pattern of hexominos to birds and fish as \"a standard construction [which] transforms one type into the other.\" The relationship between the operations of rotation and reflection are illustrated in this diagram: L1, L2 m\u20acet with angle \u00a9 Reflection in lines L1, L2 is a rotation with angle2 a Thus the hexominos are reflections and can be considered oppositely congruent. Because the hexominos are the same size and shape throughout, they are monohedral tilings. Because each hexamino is in the same relationship throughout, the tiling is isohedral. \"In mathematical terminology, an isohedral tiling is one in which the tiles form one transivity class under the group of symmetries of the tiling, that is, the group of isometries which map the tiling onto itself... Those polygons which permit isohedral tilings have been listed, and the tilings classified: there are 81 types if unmarked, 93 if marked... For isohedral tilings to 248 be of the same \"type\" it is necessary, but not sufficient, for them to have the same symmetry group, and also for each tile of one tiling to have the same number of adjacents as each tile of the other\" (Shephard, in Coxeter, p. 114). Monohedral Tilings which are isohedral (left) and not isohedra! (right) This is not the case with the birds and fish, which are the result of distortion of the grey and white hexominos into two different shapes, so the tiling is dihedral. The fish and birds do not rotate or reflect but rather translate diagonally, preserving their colour; they are classified in Escher's system as BI (rhombus on diagonal glide vectors), as P1 in the crystallographic group system. Of the difficulties in achieving such a transformation, Escher wrote, in his preface to Caroline MacGillavry's Fantasy and Symmetry (in Coxeter, 1987 p. 16): \"The border line between two adjacent shapes having a double function, the act of tracing such a line is a complicated business. On either side of it, simultaneously, a recognizability takes shape. But the human eye and mind cannot be busy with two things at the same moment and so there must be a quick and continual jumping from one side to the other.\" The version in Rosenstiehl's paper was prepared by his wife, the book illustrator Agnes Rosenstieh]. The transition between stages is made perfectly clear and yet a succesful reproduction requires more than \"a little courage\" (more skill, anyway, than this writer has); again one wonders, in this collaboration, whose was the greater debt. Rosenstiehl concludes the presentation with a discussion and theorem of thread mazes. The dodecamaze of three semi-axes and twelve layers (Rosenstiehl uses the centre rosette as a layer in his calculations) is generalised to a semi-axes and 24 layers, with all turnabouts except those on the throat alternating with straight runs on the semi-axes. These mazes he calls (a, 2\u00a3)- alternating mazes. At the outset he suggests it is unclear whether it is possible for such mazes to exist where a = 3 and \u00a3= 6. However his illustrations show one with a=7, \u00a3=8, and several with a=3,4=5. 249 The discussion concentrates on the construction of the throat. Because the stretched-H array is the only one generating alternating mazes, several observations can be made. The first is that the size of the piece cut off in the array, that is, what remains after the removal of the frame, defines the parameters a and 4. The axes can be followed through the morph from their original radiant siting to the positions they occupy parallel to one another and perpendicular to the layers that represent the concentric circuits. In the diagram they are marked N, E, S in accordance with their original location on the circular form. Because the stretched-H carries the path across the axes along the lengths of the \"upright\" elements of the H-shape, alternation of straight runs and turnabouts is inevitable. Similarly, the number of circuits is dependent upon the boundary separating the piece from the infinite repeat (a courageous person with a graphics program could carry out a morph of the (a = 7, \u00a3=8) example to verify this). Together these choices in height and width determine the range and domain of the path. The second observation concerns location of the frame in determining the type of nesting configuration in the throat: Rosenstiehl calls this the vertical cuts in the array. Two types of configuration are possible, Type F (for FOUR) has one turnabout pair nested inside a second, wider one; type S (for SIX), has two turnabout pairs nested beside each other inside a third, wider one. At most, he says, there can be two Fs, and an \"arbitrary\" number of S configurations placed consecutively and separating the Fs if there are two. This can look a little confusing in a graphic depiction, because Rosenstiehl includes a and as elements for calculation purposes: 5} 3) = a Nested configurations of the throat, F and S Rosenstieh!'s final observation concerns translation properties: the left and right cuts define identical or symmetrical systems of nested pairs. Identical would mean the throat halves were reflections of each other; that is, the products of an opposite isometry, whereas 250 the quality of being symmetrical involves the direct isometry operations of translation or rotation. As we have seen, both these isometries are engaged when generating the array from the hexomino, so it follows that the pattern also would reveal these qualities as \"isohedrality is a global condition of tiling\" ( Shephard, p. 114). This is apparent in the diagram of the path through the field: eliminating o , looking only at colour reversal, and bearing in mind that \"a perfect two-colour tiling has the property that a symmetry of the tiling either keeps all the tiles their original colour, or changes all the tiles to the opposite colour\" (Schattscheider, p. 83) we find the rotation point on the central \"East\" axis on the line between the sixth and seventh circuits (marked X on the diagram). Rotation here reverses the colour as well as the relative position of the turnabout which forms the outer arms of the S configurations dividing the tiers of the throat. Rosenstiehl takes into account the difference in results from reflection and rotation in his first theorem of (a, 24) - alternating mazes: In all (a,2\u00a3) - alternating mazes the left and right nested systems of the throat are identical or symmetrical and belong to six possible types: (F), (F, F), (F, S.... S, F) (FS, -. iS), (S, .., S, F), or (S, ..., S). \"It follows that the number of layers is partitioned as: 24=4a +6k+4B with ao, B=Oorl,k20 where o and f are F indicators and k is the number of S configurations in the system. The dodecamaze can be obtained only by the solution a = B = 0, k = 2, which means that its throat systems are necessarily of the type ( S, S).\" The mechanics of an investigation similar to this were described in Dod\u00e9cad\u00e9dale, where the five possible schematics of parenthesage were laid out. But at that point Rosenstiehl was still relying on both the law of alternation and the law of doubling, and he has stated in The Path that he is working only with alternation at this stage. We can take \"partitioning\" of the number of layers to refer to the two-tiered construction, circuits one through six and seven through twelve (remembering that the centre is included as a circuit). It is clear he is referring in this equation to one side of the throat: 24=4a+6k+4B 12 = (4x0) + (6x2) + (4x0) 12=12 251 and one can see from the drawings and diagrams that there are indeed two S systems on each side of the throat. The \"mathematical fantasy\" in his appendix showing (a= 7, \u00a3= 8) is type (F, S, S) and works out as: 24=4a+6k+4B 16 = (4x1) theorem states: The dodecamaze is the only (3, 12) - alternating maze. Given the conditions a, B =0 or 1, k = 0, no alternative is possible. The third theorem states: There exist (a,2 4) - alternating mazes only for a =3h or 3h-2, with h > 0. When 2 Z has a unique partition (24=4a+6k+4 8; witha, B =0or1,k20) it is necessary that a = 3h, and the maze is unique. When 2 \u00a3 has two distinct partitions (corresponding to a= 1, B =0, and a =0, B = 1) each one generates a maze, with its two throat systems identical if a = 3h, and symmetrical if a = 3h-2. This theorem is illustrated by the (24 = 16) \"mathematical fantasy\" maze described above. The condition (a = 3h-2) is met with h=3 giving a= 7. The throat systems are (F, S, S) and (S, S, F), reversed by rotation, an opposite symmetry operation. The condition of \"two distinct partitions\" seems to suggest that o and B are found distributed one to each side of a throat system, though whether that is all they indicate, or whether a system can contain both on one side, is not obvious.

The geometrical ratios and relationships he discerns in the labyrinth are reproduced here (James, 1981, pp. 472-473). Note how you walk around the left inner rings first, and then the right, and how afterwards you do the left outside rings, and then the right. Notice how symmetrical the pattern is, and how orderly. Each part has a meaning, and each segment stands for a position on the Way. Just as the cathedral is man's access to the altar and the Eucharist, so the labyrinth is an ideogram of the path man must travel in *\u00a2 a oS LF Ne Raw { de x .

Draw six circles around a circle of the same diameter b, and then ease them over so that they overlap one another by a fifth of the PM.'*' As there are five overlaps, the total movement has been one PM. This leaves a gap at the entry precisely the width of each of the eleven rings surrounding the centre. So the perfect Rose of God has been opened by the width of the Way to allow the pilgrim to enter Paradise. To determine the size of the petals, Scarlet made the figure in b of circles which were each one third of the circle enclosing them in \u00a2, and this circle was made a quarter of the diameter of the whole labyrinth. Divide the Way through this world by the number of substance, and divide the goal itself by the number of the spirit. The first step in the design was therefore to determine the overall diameter D in d. However there are four circles around the perimeter, and we should deal with the others first. The circle A is invisible for it passes through the centres of the cogs. It measures 161 calculated a second measure called the Ped Manualis of 353.34 mm. When used together with skil] two Ped Manualis, the measure of the master mason, known as Scarlet, who designed the labyrinth (James, 1977, pp. 107-108). Scarlet used a Roman foot of 294.45 mm in his first campaign in 1194, and from this measures can greatly enrich the design of buildings. See discussion in The Contractors (1981. n.18. p.108)]. 36PM, the number of the BVM plus one, the number of the Apostolic twelve times the Trinity, the number of the Virgin times the earthly quarternity. Each cog in the circle measures *% of the PM, so that the diameter of A is 48 of these units, while the outermost circle B measures 49 of them. 48 spells INRI while 49, as the important seven sevens, spells XS. 255 The apparent real perimeter C cuts through the 114 small circles and makes their cog- like shape. Its diameter is one tenth of the overall internal length of the cathedral from the western doors to the eastern chapel (actual length 129,100mm, while C is 12,885mm. Remember in chapter VIII:73,this is the length of the year at 365'/4PM, so the labyrinth is a cyclic part of the whole of time). Just as the cathedral is a model of the Heavenly Jerusalem, so the labyrinth as a microcosm of the cathedral is the symbol of the role the church plays in guiding men along their journey. The last circle D from which the construction in c was derived, was itself derived from the crossing. Scarlet in e took half the diagonal of the crossing as it had actually been built, not as he had planned it six years before, and on it drew a circle. The diagonal in medieval geometry represents the union of the sides, and as we suspect from ch. VIII that these may have been intended to represent both Christ and Mary, the diagonal is a repetition of the statements in the west portal, of Christ enthroned on His Mother's lap. The circle is then the perfection of this union, and within that he drew the triangle of the Trinity, the Godhead within the whole, whose side produced the circle D. The ring between D and the petals was then divided into eleven tracks in f, and the width of each of these was divided into eleven parts, two of which made the solid strip between the tracks. The proportions of the tracks reinforce the numbers which created them. Eleven is a somewhat non-Christian number. Its source may be Arab, and this is discussed in James, 1977. 256 APPENDIX 10 Words and Music of Taiz\u00e9 J 60 De noche De no -che_i-re-mos,de noche que pa-ra_encon-trar la - te, sd-lo lased nosa-lum - bra ' s6-lo la sed nos a-fum-bra.

Acknowledge the long (and extra) hours they have been working\" \"Now it's time for a break....\" * If using ideas about the labyrinth improving whole brain activity, offer it to them as a way of improving their crime solving skills, or ability to act \"instinctively\" in an emergency situation because they are the ones who most need to think fully to do their jobs effectively. Tell them it can help them be better at crime solving/quick response, etc. * If creating one piece of material for different emergency personnel, make sure to mention the separate groups and acknowledge what each does---don't lump them together. * Try using crime solving or work related language for defining a walk---\"observe your body closely like you would a crime scene (or a patient---for EMTs or the scene for firefighters)--- in other words emphasize using the good intuitive skills they already have to explore how this tool can help sharpen them. * Consider asking emergency workers to walk the labyrinth to help others\u2014do this by explaining that you are trying to find ways to help people (like evacuees) who have experienced things they cope with every day for the first time. Ask them then to bring particularly difficult problems, situations etc. to the labyrinth to see if they are helped by walking. * Use language like this can help you \"be at the top of your game.\" * Use language that is concrete--something that tells them that there can be discernible results that aren't mystical or WU WU... * Discuss the fact that this is a way to relax \"effectively\" not just another session where they rehash events. By relaxing effectively, they can go back to work better able to be at their best performance. Now the don'ts: 259 * One of the first concerns will be whether this is \"touchy/feely stuff.\" Avoid language that implies that something mystical or mysterious is going to happen. *Avoid using any language that implies weakness and not being able to cope. Fear of psychologists, therapy is real among this population. * There may be fears that engaging in these activities will make them feel weird... * Don't use terms like stress management--a buzz word that will turn this audience off. * Avoid any activity with the labyrinth that will involve forming a circle or holding hands. * Avoid language that might allow them to play with sexual interpretations in their anxiousness--for example--going at your own rhythm in the labyrinth when describing walking--going back and forth, etc. With thanks to Daria Woodside, a former critical care nurse, who left the profession because of stress and \"became a debriefer later because no one was around to offer that to me when | needed it.\" Daria Woodside's theory about the \"'whole brain\" experience that the labyrinth creates and how much that is like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing): \"EMDR is proving to be one of the best treatments for PTSD, and this group, after all the horrors of Katrina and Rita, certainly are candidates for that. in EMDR, one of the theories is that the trauma is lodged in a right brain experience and when you do the alternating movements or sounds as the person remembers the traumatizing event, it helps create a pathway to the left brain that allows the memory to be fully processed and the trauma surrounding it to be released. | don't want to make claims about the labyrinth, that aren't substantiated, but | suspect that it can have the same effect as EMDR.\" ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND PHOTO CREDITS | would like to acknowledge the following individuals for granting permission to use their ideas, words, and images: Keith Critchlow, Lee Dickey, Robert Ferr\u00e9, John James, Ben Nicholson, Pierre Rosenstiehl, and Jeff Saward.
