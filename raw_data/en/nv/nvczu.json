PD occurs due to many factors, from which one of the acknowledged effects of oxidative stress is pathogenic pathways that play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease. Antioxidants, including flavonoids, vitamins E and C, and polyphenolic substances, help to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by free radicals. Consequently, this lowers the risk of neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. Although there is currently no cure for neurodegenerative illnesses, these conditions can be controlled. The treatment of this disease lessens its symptoms, which helps to preserve the patient's quality of life. Therefore, the use of naturally occurring antioxidants, such as polyphenols, which may be obtained through food or nutritional supplements and have a variety of positive effects, has emerged as an appealing alternative management strategy. This article will examine the extent of knowledge about antioxidants in the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses, as well as future directions for research. Additionally, an evaluation of the value of antioxidants as neuroprotective agents will be provided.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-21", "cleaned_text": "A Review on Natural Antioxidants for Their Role in the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16070908](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16070908) [Plant-Derived Nanotherapeutics abnormalities, autoimmunity, asymmetry, toxicity, elevated blood pressure, oxidative stress, and peripheral vascular diseases are subject to both experimental and epidemiological research. Some of the risk variables that have been discovered through the clinical manifestations of NDDs are associated with free radical toxicity, radical-mediated alteration, oxidase dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress caused by perinatal genetic abnormalities. The most important common symptoms are disturbances in balance, breathing, movement, reflexes, motor skills, or cardiac activity. Antioxidants such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and vitamins E and C can help to prevent these symptoms [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Antioxidants have a great impact on human health, as they can fight free radicals and, thus, halt the aging process and decrease the effects of oxidative damage caused by, for example, an unbalanced diet [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. As a result, the long-term risk of neurodegenerative diseases is reduced ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-f001)). Although they can be treated, there is currently no cure for neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment of this disease relieves the symptoms in order to preserve the quality of life. Natural antioxidants, such as polyphenols, are becoming more popular because they can be obtained from foods and supplements and offer a range of health benefits [ [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Although it affects both males and females with increase in their age but males tend to be affected more frequently [ [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. It is considered an international disease that does not distinguish between social class or race. The disease is estimated to affect 1% of people over the age of 65 worldwide, accounting for up to two-thirds of all people with movement disorders [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. PD is referred to asa synucleinopathy because Lewy bodies, a crucial clinical characteristic of the disease, accumulate due to the misfolding of -synuclein as a major feature. Furthermore, -synuclein appears to be connected to both idiopathic and inherited forms of Parkinson's disease and has a special role in the disease's pathogenesis. It is worth noting that -synuclein buildup has been closely linked to posttranslational modifications, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial biogenesis, changed mitochondrial physical properties, synapse dysfunction, glycolipids, ER stress, and metal complexes. The overproduction of ROS and years of age breakdown the antioxidant defense system and increase oxidative stress in certainbrain areas, which can contribute to the misfolding of -synuclein being the catalyst for the aging process in PD [ [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Although it is not a cure, levodopa has emerged as an efficacious drug for PD's first motor symptoms. Despite the fact that stiffness and bradykinesia respond the best, tremors may only be somewhat reduced by levodopa. Other symptoms, such as balance issues, may worsen. L-dopa, however, cannot be used to treat Lewy disease, non-motor symptoms, or neuronal loss [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Patients require greater L-dopa doses over time, which is accompanied by a rise in side effects such as dyskinesias. Amantadine, an antiviral medication, appears to alleviate motor problems as well. Medicines based on dopamine agonists are also administered to address a range of neuromotor symptoms that are associated with disease progression. The long-term use of conventional PD medications can lead to adverse effects, such as dyskinesias and motor fluctuations ( [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t001)). As a result, novel therapeutic techniques used to prevent neurodegeneration, non-motor symptoms, Lewy disease accumulation, or synuclein aggregation in the brain are required [ [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Numerous natural phytochemicals have emerged as therapeutically interesting compounds, drug entities, and phytochemicals for the treatment of inflammatory disorders [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Additionally, numerous pharmacological studies have shown that phytochemicals are useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), active they serve as the antioxidant defense system's primary and secondary metabolites, which protect against a variety of stress-related disorders and clinical symptoms [ [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. These phytochemicals' positive and therapeutic effects include antioxidant capacity, pathogen prevention, immune system activation, and nutritional support for healthy living cells [ [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Botanical substances, with their active phytonutrients, efficiently salvage oxygen-based free radicals, influencing the antioxidative defense system and contributing to major cognitive impairments such as dyskinesias, residual tremors, muscle stiffness, and instability [ [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. This review holds prime importance, as it addresses the treatment gaps in PD and explores the potential of natural antioxidants as a therapeutic approach. By summarizing the current literature on natural antioxidants and their effects on PD, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview that can guide further research and clinical trials. Understanding the role of natural antioxidants in PD treatment may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that can modify the disease course, mitigate the symptoms, and improve the quality of life for individuals living with PD. In this review, we address the natural antioxidants that can be used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as their mode of of flavonoids and terpenoids are believed to be accountable for their therapeutic effects. Terpenoids, phenols, and flavonoids show important neuroprotective effects, due to their oxidative capacity [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. extra protons, flavonoids scavenge hydroxyl, and peroxyl radicals by donating an extra proton. This prevents ROS generation by the formation of complex structures containing dihydroxy groups, copper, multiple ions of transition metals, and iron [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [39](#B39-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Diverse structures of flavones have been discovered to increase the capacity of antioxidant enzymes and also work in inhibiting COX-2, which is a pro-inflammatory mediator. Experiments with xanthine oxidase demonstrate that chrysin dramatically reduces ROS production. It is worth noting that rodent models require polyphenol dosages ranging from 10 \u00b5M to 100 \u00b5M to exercise their putative antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [ [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Oxidative stress damage is a prominent manifestation of neurodegenerative disorders. However, few efficacious agents have been found for clinical use, and even fewer have been successful because of their toxicity and cancer risks [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Evidence suggests that neuroprotection is a potential pharmaceutical target for neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that it is possible. The use of relatively harmless antioxidant molecules found in food as remedies for many ailments, on the other hand, is appealing; however, it is limited by the difficulty of creating positive feedback in the brain. Polyphenols, a class of antioxidants, have been shown to have neuroprotective properties. Many biological processes, such as interactions with metal complexes, the scavenging of free radicals, changes in the activity of different enzymes, and impacts on intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression are all biological processes that contribute to this protection. A diet that is high in antioxidants is essential to prevent many diseases [ [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. A reduction in the incidence of stroke, neurological disease, heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure has been associated with these chemicals, which are primarily present in vegetables and fruit. The body's natural antioxidant system needs help from the exogenous antioxidants that are found in fruits, nuts, vegetables, and other foods. Exogenous antioxidants are often classified as vitamins and non-vitamins. This section reviews the specific properties and roles of the key exogenous antioxidants in neuroprotection ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-f004)) [ [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. The human body cannot produce this vitamin itself, therefore, it must be obtained from food ( [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t002)). [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Vitamin E bioavailability varies with many factors, including the dietary matrix, genetics, and metabolic fat, and ranges from 10 to 33%. Preclinical studies in Parkinson's disease have shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of vitamin E as a disease-modifying agent [ [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Vitamin E deficiency increased substantia nigra MPTP toxicity, while partially protecting against neurotransmitter and metabolite deficiencies caused by striatal MPTP. Dopamine degradation could not be stopped, even by pre-MPTP injection therapy with -tocopherol. However, substantial amounts of vitamin E may partially protect dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-mediated toxicity [ [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. During the Deprenyl and Tocopherol antioxidative treatment of Parkinsonism study, patients with early or untreated Parkinson's disease were given deprenyl (10 micrograms daily) and tocopherol as a treatment. The results of the study demonstrated that the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (deprenyl) slowed the progression of the disorders.However, the modest improvement in motor function gradually diminished when deprenyl was discontinued [ [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. In individuals with Parkinson's disease with a recent diagnosis, vitamin C and alpha-tocopherol supplementation delayed the initiation of levodopa therapy by 25 years. |Compound Name||Disease||Impact||Ref.| |Vitamin E||Alzheimer's disease (AD)||Effective against AD when consumed with vitamin C in the earlier phase of AD.||[|[51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. A family of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters contains the key proteins that are involved in substance distribution and tissue absorption. The brain contains one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C in the body. Concentrations vary per brain region, with the motor cortex having the lowest concentration [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Different transporters are present in the brain for reduced and oxidized forms of vitamin C (SVCT2 or GLUT family). Individuals whosuffer from neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit low plasma exogenous antioxidant concentrations (including vitamin C). A lack of vitamin C has also been related to a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. It has been proposed that the level of vitamin C in lymphocytes could serve as a diagnostic indicator of Parkinson's disease progression. Vitamin C supplementation is one of the medicinal methods used to cure disease [ oral quercetin administration improved the motor performance in arat model by lowering the mitochondrial oxidative stress, -synuclein aggregation formation, [Table 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t004)) [ [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. When they are taken orally, the flavonoids and green tea's polyphenols have been demonstrated to prevent aging. Tea catechins (TC) are commonly thought to be radical scavengers, although other components of tea have numerous applications, possibly protecting against 6-OHDP-induced apoptosis. In MTT assays, 6-OHDA treatment decreased the cell in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and DNA fragmentation confirmed apoptosis in PC12 cells. TC substantially reduces PC12 cell death. EGC and EC had lower efficacy, but EGCG and ECG were more efficacious compared to TC. The protective effect increased from 50 \u00b5M to 400 \u00b5M, and, at these concentrations, EGCG outperformed the green tea polyphenols. They inhibit at 83.2% and 84.9%, respectively, while EGCG inhibitory concentration is at 88.4% and [ [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. According to flow cytometry data, 200-400 \u00b5M of green tea polyphenols and EGCG decrease the number of apoptotic cells. Notably, EGCG-protected PC12 cells abolished [Table 5](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t005)). [Table 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t006)) has been found that it exhibits neuroprotection by antagonizing the toxic effect of the critical A protein [ [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. As a result, it can be used for PD management. [75](#B75-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. According to research, nicotine receptors play a major role in nicotine's protective potential. The findings imply that nicotine may assist in averting the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and Alzheimer's. Although smoking has been linked to a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease, the specific mechanism for this is unknown. Nicotine has been discovered to suppress cytochrome C release from intact mitochondria, as well as the high-amplitude mitochondrial swelling that is caused by calcium and N-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPPt). The redox state within mitochondria was also maintained by nicotine, which was likelyas a result of decreased mitochondrial permeability. Nicotine did not prevent the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential by MPPt or calcium, but decreased electron leakage at sites of respiratory chain complex I and 6-OHDA, causing cytochrome C release and in Parkinson's disease patients, and lower serum carotenoid levels are also linked to motor impairment. Carotenoids act as antioxidants by eliminating ROS via chemical and physical reactions; for example, -carotene absorbs thermal energy from singlet oxygen and/or peroxynitrite, therefore, inhibiting tyrosine nitration. Carotenoids protect neurons against neurodegenerative diseases in multiple ways, including ROS quenching, the activation of antioxidant enzyme COX-2 and TNF gene output [ [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. This phenol has a short oral survival period due to its low water solubility and short half-life (10 min). Furthermore, resveratrol derivatives triethylsilyl and ditriisopropylsilyl show superior action in invitro anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties when compared to pure resveratrol. Resveratrol is employed because it has shown increased biocompatibility and neuroprotective properties in zebrafish embryos. Also selected from the prodrugs, this chemical reduced clinical scores and the severity of motor impairment in a 3-nitropropionic acid PD mousemodel [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Tannic acid was as the most optimistic molecule to minimize -synuclein fibrosis without significantly raising toxicity TH-positive cell death and DA depletion. In addition, it reduces inflammatory markers such as total nitrite, cytokines, and after shown to guard against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Furthermore, EGb761 reduced Monoamine oxidase, an enzyme that is involved in dopamine metabolism and the production of free radicals that damage nigrostriatal neurons, was either inhibited or lowered by EGb761 [ [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] ( [Table 12](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t012)). [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. In a dose-dependent pre-administration of pomegranate extract standardized to 40% ellagic acid shields adult rats against the neuronal damage that is brought on by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. The neuroprotective antiapoptotic effect of the extract was in addition to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, reduce levels of TNF and caspase-3-attributed nuclear factor NF-B p65, and [Table 13](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t013)). [112](#B112-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Baicalein treatment raises levels in the basal ganglia. In increasing DA levels, DJ-1 and DA transporter expression were also improved. Safflower can reduce the reactive Puerarin, DA, and also safeguards tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons from the damage that for Parkinson's tremors, induces jaw movements that can be reduced by passionflower extract. The duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in animals was significantly shortened, and cognitive performance improved. The antioxidant activity of this herb is responsible for its PD effects [ [135](#B135-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] ( [Table 19](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t019)). [138](#B138-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. St. John's wort extract decreased the neurotoxicity that was produced by long-term rotenone therapy in rats. St. John's wort reduces the damage caused to neurons and also prevents apoptosis by lowering the Bax levels. After dopaminergic neuron lesioning in rats, it lowered striatal malondialdehyde levels, catalase activity, glutathione (GSH) content, tumor necrosis malfunction, it can protect PC12 cells from neuronal cell death caused by MPP+ [ [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. By blocking and caspase-3 activation in colchicine-induced mortality of cortical neurons were significantly reduced at 3-10 \u00b5M [ [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] ( [Table 22](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t022)). [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. These levels and inhibit synuclein aggregation. Cucumaria frondosa sea cucumber extract has high SCG-2, and SCG-3, which raises TrkA phosphorylation action ( [Table 23](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t023)). [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Although oleuropein is the most abundant, olive oil also contains aglycones and oleurosides, as well as other oleuropein derivatives, such as beta-6-sulfonic acid, and a radical scavenger of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals. The use of oleuropein and its derivatives has been found to minimize ROS accumulation [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-16-00908), [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)] ( [Table 24](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t024)). [166](#B166-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Because of its antioxidant capabilities, which include the capacity to minimize excessive free radical formation and metal chelation, it is widely known for having a wide range of positive effects against many disorders [ [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. According to recently released scholarly research, it may have neuroprotective properties. Theaflavin has been shown to be similarly as efficient as EGCG in reducingamyloid- and -synuclein-induced neurotoxicity because [Table 25](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t025)). [173](#B173-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. It also pharmacological potential such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective qualities [ [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. It has been discovered that it can interact with the peroxy radicals that are responsible for lipid peroxidation, allowing it to successfully cure a variety of disorders. It has been demonstrated that caffeine increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes such SOD, GPx, GSH, and CAT, and also reduces the overproduction of ROS and RNS [ [175](#B175-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Furthermore, after delivery, striatal DA levels increased significantly, while potential disease modulator that can also assist in the decrease of Parkinson's disease symptoms ( [Table 27](#pharmaceuticals-16-00908-t027)). [186](#B186-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. It can simply pass the blood-brain barrier, preventing oxidative damage to primary dopaminergic neurons in a rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease model, therapeutic properties [ [204](#B204-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. It also has a low toxicity level. Through decreasing lipid peroxidation and ROS production through the action of its phenolic hydroxyl group, ferulic acid is able to carry out these functions. It also suppresses the expression of enzymes that promote to have the power to decrease A oligomerization and cell proliferation in the in vitro study; however, when it was injected into mice, it showed poor bioavailability [ [231](#B231-pharmaceuticals-16-00908)]. Curcumin was formulated by using nanoliposomes, which improved the bioavailability without compromising the drug's ability Conclusions 3.
