Almost any complaint can benefit from a Homeopathic, holistic approach. Holistic means, taking in to account the mental and emotional symptoms, as well as physical and social aspects. To get to the point where I can understand this full picture and to enable me to propose a personal treatment plan the first step is to have a thorough consultation, during which I explore with my clients each of the aspects outlined above. I have helped people for many years with various chronic conditions such as Asthma, Depression, Anxiety, Sleep issues, Hormone imbalance, Behavioural issues, Gut problems and Skin condition. My support has also helped people to recover more quickly, and with fewer complications, from injury, acute ailments, necessary surgery, anaesthesia and to cope better through chemotherapy. I have been privileged to work successfully with people of all backgrounds and all ages, from ante-natal to end of life care. From playground ailments to middle age crisis. I have supported many people through births and many people through grief. Additionally Elle has helped people to recover more quickly, and with fewer complications, from injury, acute ailments, necessary surgery, anaesthesia and chemotherapy.

Elle made me feel really comfortable, never judged me and I felt very at ease discussing my life history. After an indepth chat, I was given my remedies. Within 2 months I noticed a huge difference in my ability to walk pain free. Usually after 5 mins the pain would kick in, which would only get worse the further I walked. But after just 2 months, it took about 20 mins, and now 9 months on, it's anything between 1-2 hours! In fact, pain doesn't affect me much these days, only when I overdo things. That's no pain in any of my limbs or joints - it's overwhelming how much homeopathy improved my health. And to think I dismissed the idea 1-2 years earlier, as I just didn't understand it. I can only highly recommend Elle, her knowledge is endless and she is a very kind and beautiful person.\" \"I have had a few Homoeopathy remedies from Elle for various reasons, she is very helpful and the remedies have worked very well. Highly recommended "}
