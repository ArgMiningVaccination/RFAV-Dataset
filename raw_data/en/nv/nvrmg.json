Until her kidneys failed and she began dialysis, she never realized there was a connection\u2014 that the high blood pressure was damaging her kidneys. She didn't consider checking her kidney function and her doctor never suggested it. Dolores isn't alone in ignor- ing her kidneys. Unless they're not working, most people don't focus on how integral the kid-neys are to the functioning of the rest of the body and what to do to protect them. Although they are fi st-sized, the kidneys multi- task 24/7 as they fi lter toxins from the blood, activate Vitamin D to maintain healthy bones and release the hormone that regu-lates blood pressure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when the kidneys are damaged and high levels of waste begin to accumulate in the blood. Today, 26 million Americans have chronic kidney disease, yet with early detection and control of risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes, more than two-thirds of new cases of kidney failure are preventable. Screen-ing for those at risk is essential to fi nding, managing and treating the disease. Kidney cancer is a related condi- tion that is also often found in the later stages. Symptoms include blood in the urine or a lump in the back. Smoking, obesity, kidney failure and contact with harmful chemicals are all risk factors that can be avoided or controlled. Kid-ney cancer is treated by surgically removing all or part of the kidney, radiation and chemotherapy. It is serious, but the earlier it is found, the greater the chance that it can be cured. A number of new drugs are now available that show promise in managing advanced kidney cancer. The medical community is turning kidney disease and kidney cancer into treatable and in some cases, preventable conditions. The National Kidney Foundation off ers free screenings to those at risk through its Kidney Early Eval- uation Program (KEEP). For those with symptoms of kidney cancer, doctors can detect it through tests performed in their offi ce. The call to action is clear. Understanding the kidneys' major role in overall health, knowing risk factors for these conditions and taking the time to get screened can make a diff erence in the lives and health of thousands.

So when my mom told me that was her diagnosis, I was shocked.\" Even more shocking, she says, was how little was known about the disease and its potential treatments. At the time her mother, Joni, was diagnosed, there was no treatment available.

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 50,000 of these individuals were diagnosed with kidney cancer. But there is hope: More than 200,000 kidney cancer survivors are living in the United States right now. Recent advances in diagnosis, surgical procedures, and treatment options will allow even more patients to live with the dis - ease, continuing to maintain their normal schedules and lifestyles. This marks the beginning of an important new era for kidney cancer patients, with the recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of new drugs to treat their advanced disease. These drugs target cancer cells in different ways than current drugs used to treat kidney cancer, and will have a very positive impact for many patients. Continued research efforts will improve our understanding of the disease even more and increase the options available to fight kidney cancer. time to start healing Each person diagnosed with kid - ney cancer goes through the shock of being told they have the disease. It is a difficult experience. Feelings of shock, loneliness, alienation, fear, frustration, anger, and hurt are natural parts of any life-threaten - ing illness. It is okay to have these feelings, to cry, and to be upset. After the shock of diagnosis, it's time to start healing. Don't let your emotions and your cancer destroy your home life or relations with the important people in your life. They may also be hurting inside, fearing for you and them - selves. When cancer strikes, it hits the whole family. Your friends and family are rooting for you. Sometimes kidney cancer is called by its medical name, renal cell carcinoma. Kidney cancer includes various forms, including clear cell, papillary, sarcomatoid, transitional cell, and others. Some patients are diagnosed before the cancer has metasta - sized (spread) to other parts of the body, while others have meta - static disease when their cancer is initially diagnosed. Surgery may be the first course of treatment, or systemic treatment\u2014that is, a treatment that is injected into the bloodstream or swallowed\u2014may be recommended prior to surgery (though this tends to be rare). If surgery is done first, additional treatment may be recommended to delay the cancer's return, or to treat metastatic disease. The choice of treatment, where treatment is administered, the frequency of check-ups, and many other aspects of the management of your disease are determined with input from you. The more you know, the better your deci- sions, and the more you can feel in control of your illness. Knowledge about your disease will help you better communicate with your doctor and nurse, and increase your confidence in the treatment that you receive. Getting smarter about kidney cancer is an impor - tant step in effectively fighting your disease. surviving kidney cancer there are almost 53,000 people waiting for a kidney transplant, but only 16,500 are performed each year, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Once donated, kidneys can function for about 16 years. Wait times could improve more, according to the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Titte Srinivas. Blood type com - patibility, previous pregnancies or blood transfusions all affect wait list times. Socioeconomic factors also play a role\u2014older, poorer minorities and those without healthcare wait the longest. \"More than half the people over age 60 will not live to see a transplant,\" Dr. Srinivas says. He advises getting on a wait list as soon as you're diagnosed.\"Living donors are heroes in transplantation,\" he says. Paired donation matches one incompat - ible living donor/recipient pair to another pair in the same situation. Other advances include noc - tural dialysis at sleep clinics, home dialysis, and expanded criteria for kidney donation acceptance.

CKD patients experience increasing symptoms as the disease progresses, with fatigue, weakness, inability to concen - trate, loss of libido prominent. Most patients develop CKD because of diabetes, hyperten - sion, or a combination of these factors. CKD patients represent only one percent of all Medicare patients but consume over 10 percent of all Medicare dollars. It is now known that CKD patients have an increase in inflammation throughout the body resulting in an increased propensity to heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb ampu - tations. Research has greatly increased the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the inflammatory process. Unfortu - nately, therapeutic approaches to preventing or treating the inflammation have lagged behind, although considerable research effort is ongoing in this area. Nutraceuticals are foods or food products that provide health benefits. Unlike medica - tions, either over the counter or prescription, nutraceuticals are available to the public without the same oversight require - ments or FDA approval. They can be made readily available upon development, but consumers must be cautious to be sure that the claims made for safety and efficacy can be substantiated with solid evidence. A number of nutraceuticals have now been identified to have anti-inflammatory properties and this has raised the excit - ing possibility that treatment of the inflammatory component of CKD may be possible. A num - ber of nutraceutical companies are now undertaking rigorous clinical research to test the value of these substances scientifi - cally. If this research shows that nutraceuticals can provide safe and effective anti-inflammatory therapy, longer lives and higher quality of life may be possible for CKD where inflammation is a key contributor to poor outcomes. a future role for nutraceuticals in chronic kidney disease? Dr. allen Nissenson emeritus professor of medicine, david Geffen school of medicine at uCla; Chief medical officer, daVita inc.insight When it comes to dietary sodium, less is certainly best, yet americans today consume 50 percent more than the recommended daily quantities of sodium. According to the National Kidney Foundation, diets high in sodium increase blood pressure levels. High blood pressure damages the kidneys over time, and is a leading cause of kidney failure. \"As high blood pressure rates have increased, kidney disease has spiraled to the point where it now affects 26 million Americans. Reducing salt intake can lower blood pressure and that may be beneficial in easing the burden of chronic kidney disease in this country,\" says Dr. Joseph Vassa - lotti, Chief Medical Officer of the National Kidney Foundation. the National Kidney foun- dation offers the best tips to help reduce salt intake: Stick to fresh meats, rather than packaged products, which are high in sodium.Fresh fruits and vegetables are low in sodium. Canned and frozen fruits and veggies are typically low-salt as well. But watch out for frozen vegetables that contain added seasoning or sauces, which may contain lots of extra salt. Make reading food labels a habit. Sodium content is always listed on food labels. Sodium content can vary from brand to brand, so compare and choose the lowest sodium product. Avoid spices and seasonings that contain added sodium, for example garlic salt. Pick garlic powder instead. Many restaurants list the sodium content of their products on their Web sites, so do your homework before dining out. When dining out, you can also request that your food be prepared without any added salt. Try to spread your sodium intake out throughout the day; it's easier on your kidneys than eating lots of salt all at once. You can learn to adjust to eat - ing less salt. It typically takes about six to eight weeks on a low-sodium diet to get used to it. After that, you'll actually find it harder to eat very salty foods, like potato chips.

Those three little words continually provide moti- vation for two-time kidney recipi- ent and Ironman competitor Shad Ireland Typical descriptions of pro- fessional athletes usually don't include diagnoses of childhood kidney disease or double kidney transplants; but Shad Ireland is anything but typical. Once given only six months to live and having wasted away to a mere 75 pounds, Ireland found inspiration when watching the Ironman competi-tion on TV. He saw athletes \"doing the impossible, and I wanted what they had,\" he says. Ignoring the physicians who told him he'd never compete, within 24 months Ireland had bounced back and was living healthily on dialysis. But that was not enough: In 2004, he became the fi rst dialysis patient to fi nish an Ironman com- petition (running, swimming, and biking for a combined 140.6 miles). As a national spokesperson for Fresenius Medical Care and home dialysis, Ireland spent 2009 biking 4,639 miles across the country to raise awareness about kidney dis- ease and its lack of limitations. \"Inspiration comes in all dif- ferent shapes, sizes, and forms,\" he says. \"One of the things I say to patients across the country is that you have to believe in the possibil- ity of it all.\" Ireland's current goal is to \"not only inspire, but to provide the tools and resources to give other patients a format to follow.\" His belief that kidney disease \"does not limit your ability\" comes through in each of his clinic visits. He knows that initial diagnosis may seem overwhelming, but that it's possible to live a normal and even active lifestlye on dialysis. By focusing on what patients can do instead of what they can't is a message Ireland will continue to spread. \"It's been a dream of mine since I was a kid to be an athlete.

A- Duane, 2 year NxStage Patientend-stage renal failure (eSRD) is a devastating health condition affecting 500,000 americans. Because the kidneys perform many life-sustaining functions, patients reaching this threshold of chronic kidney disease must even-tually choose from a growing array options for kidney replacement. Hemodialysis (HD) is the most common form of renal replace- ment, which relies on a highly sophisticated machine to fi lter the blood. This form of dialysis has seen a fairly recent proliferation in options, both in terms of inten- sity and in venue (at home vs. in hospital). Home hemodialysis has allowed patients with ESRD to enhance their treatment eff ec- tiveness and has restored many patients' quality of life. While con-siderable obstacles remain in this treatment area, including funding issues and various safety concerns (namely, venal needle dislodge- ment, which has been recognized by the Renal Physicians Associa-tion as one of the top areas need-ing safety improvement), there is tremendous optimism regarding this burgeoning therapy.Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is home-based therapy that off ers clinical outcomes similar to con-ventional hemodialysis but with some definite lifestyle advan- tages. In PD, the abdomen is fi lled with dialysate, which draws extra fl uid and waste products out of the blood. The vast majority of care for PD patients takes place outside the clinical setting and allows for considerable portability. The ideal option is renal trans- plantation, which is associated with better life expectancy and quality of life. As a result, demand for this procedure has led to a defi cit of organs available from deceased donors. Live donation is a superior alternative that is associated with even better outcomes. Over the last decade, new strategies have emerged to expand the supply, including paired exchange, which allows donor pairs who are not compat-ible with one another to essen-tially 'swap' kidneys with other pairs whom they have never met. Paired exchange has evolved to allow long donor-recipient chains throughout the country.
