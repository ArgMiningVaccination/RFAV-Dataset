BARCIA OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 15, 2000 Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in honoring thelife and work of Dr. Robert C. Prophater fol-lowing his half-century service to his fellowman, as a physician, a leader and as a father.During his fifty year career, Dr. Prophaterworked to improve the health and well-beingof his community both as a doctor and as VicePresident of Corporate Medical Affairs for BayHealth Systems in his home town of Bay City,Michigan. For more than five decades, Dr. Prophater has applied his healing hands to the medicalneeds of those under his care. His dedicationand devotion to the precepts of the Hippo-cratic oath serve as a model for younger phy-sicians and those considering entering thishonorable profession. Indeed, one has to lookno farther than Dr. Prophater's family to findan example of his influence in drawing othersto the medical profession. His son, Dr. RobertC. Prophater Jr., has followed in his footstepsand is also practicing medicine and savinglives. During his long and venerable career, Dr. Prophater has taken seriously his duty toshare his vast knowledge and experience withhis colleagues as an active member of numer-ous medical boards and medical associationsthroughout the state of Michigan and the en-tire Midwest. Of all of these honors, perhapsclosest to his heart was his tenure on theBoard of Directors of the Bay Medical Centerin his home town of Bay City, including a fouryear term as Board President. While Dr. Prophater above all deserves our praise for his dedication to medicine, he hasalso made a tremendously positive impact onBay City, where he has lived and workedsince moving from Ohio in 1958. His civic in-volvement epitomizes the spirit of public serv-ice to which all citizens should aspire, but fewever achieve. During his time serving BayCity, Dr. Prophater volunteered his talents andintellect to the Bay Area Chamber of Com-merce, the local advisory board for a profes-sional football league, to the board of a localcollege and a host of other activities. In theclassic American civic tradition, he also servedhis community in the political arena, includinga stint as President of the Bay City Commis-sion. His accolades are many, including theMichigan State Medical Society CommunityService Award and induction into the SaginawValley Chapter of Commerce Hall of Fame in 1989. Mr. Speaker, I earnestly hope my col- leagues will join me today in publicly honoringDr. Robert C. Prophater with the official grati-tude of the United States House of Represent-atives for a lifetime of contributions to thehealth and welfare of his community, his stateand his family. /fdash CONTINUING HEALTH CARE AC- TIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENTREFORM COMMITTEE HON. DAN BURTON OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Friday, December 15, 2000 Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, as we close out the 106th Congress, the Govern-ment Reform Committee, which I am proud toserve as Chairman, is continuing severalhealth care oversight activities. Last year we began a review of this nation's vaccine immunization program. While child-hood immunizations have been lauded as oneof the greatest advances in public health ofthe twentieth century, we have learned thatthere is a paucity of research evaluating thelong term safety of these vaccines, particularlyas they are currently given to babies, six shotsin one day. We also have learned that the epi-demic rise in pervasive developmental delaysincluding autism may be unrecognized ad-verse effect of vaccines. Research conductedin England discovered that autistic children,who also suffer with chronic diarrhea andbowel disorders, have the measles virus intheir bowel. We also learned that many ofthese vaccines are made with the preservativethimerosal. Thimerosal is a derivative of mer-cury, which is a known neurotoxin. We learnedthat mercury toxicity has very similar symp-toms to autism. Many children who are treatedfor mercury toxicity show an improvement inthe autistic symptoms. I have asked the Department of Health and Human Services to recall vaccines that con-tain thimerosal since most of the vaccines onthe childhood immunization schedule are nowavailable without thimerosal. However, thusfar, they are satisfied with allowing companiesto continue to sell these vaccines and putting8,000 children in the United States at risk formercury toxicity. As part of this investigationwe looked at the advisory committees at theCenters for Disease Control and at the Foodand Drug Administration and found that manyof the individuals appointed as advisory coun-cil members had significant financial ties to thepharmaceutical companies that manufacturethe vaccines under consideration. The reportof our findings is on the Committee website. As part of our vaccine investigation, we looked at the Defense Department's AnthraxVaccine Immunization Program. We found thatthis well-intentioned program had many prob-lems and I have supported legislation thatwould halt the program. The existing anthraxvaccine manufactured by Bioport Inc. in Lan-sing, Michigan was licensed in 1970 to protectagainst cutaneous exposure to the anthrax. Itwas not originally licensed to protect againstinhalation anthrax. While the label states thatless than one percent of individuals who re-ceive the vaccine will suffer an adverseevents, each of the prospective studies that have been done have shown that in excess oftwenty percent of those who receive the vac-cine suffer an adverse event. Many of theseevents have proven difficult to treat and arevery similar to those seen in Gulf War Syn-drome. An investigation conducted by theGeneral Accounting Office indicates that themandatory AVIP program has resulted in asignificant morale and retention problem. There are some that think that because I have dared to initiate an oversight investiga-tion into vaccines, that I am anti-vaccine.Nothing could be further from the truth. I be-lieve that safe and effective vaccines shouldbe made available to everyone with full dec-laration of the benefits and the risks involved.I also believe that we need to do more re- search to determine who will be at risk for ad-verse events and that just because a vaccineis licensed does not mean it needs to beadded to the children's immunization scheduleto be mandated at the state level. We sawwith the rotashield vaccine investigation thatthe move to put this vaccine on the scheduletook place before the vaccine was even li-censed. There is concern we have gone toofar in our desire to protect the public at largefrom infectious diseases by mandating everyvaccine that is licensed instead of only thosethat are truly significant health concerns in thiscountry. There is a tremendous difference be-tween the consequences of polio and those ofchicken pox. Also during the 106th Congress, we have conducted an investigation into the role ofcomplementary and alternative medicine in ourhealth care system. Americans are increas-ingly turning to therapies such as acupuncture,massage therapy, chiropractics, naturopathy,touch and energy therapies, herbal medicine,traditional healing systems such as Ayurveda,Tibetan Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medi-cine, Native American medicine, mind-bodytechniques, aromatherapy, nutrition, and musictherapy to improve their health. We have con-ducted numerous hearings looking at ways toimprove cancer care through the integration ofcomplementary and alternative medicine in on-cology. I was pleased to introduced H.R. 3677 the Thomas Navarro FDA Patients Rights act thispast spring. Four year old Thomas, who wasshown to the world by Ambassador AlanKeyes during the Republican debates, was di-agnosed with medulloblastoma, was deniedaccess to a non-toxic cancer treatment by theFDA because he had not first gone throughand failed chemotherapy and radiation. Afterhis initial surgery, Thomas' parents, Jim andDonna Navarro, looked at the benefits andrisks of these two treatments and found thatthe success rates had been overestimatedand that the risks were too much to ask ofthem without first trying something less risky.We learned that of the three chemotherapydrugs which are routinely recommended totreat this cancer, two of them clearly state ontheir label that they have not been proven tobe safe and effective in the pediatric popu-lation. In other words, the drug had not gonethrough the rigors of an FDA approval processfor treating medulloblastoma or for use in chil-dren. I am very concerned that the FDA willforce cancer patients into treatments they asan agency have not evaluated while denyingthem access to a clinical trial that the FDA ismonitoring. I was pleased that many of my VerDate 11<MAY>2000 04:26 Dec "}
