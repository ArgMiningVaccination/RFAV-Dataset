Students Step into the Shoes of Real Scientists Offer students a glimpse into an exciting STEM career through simulations where they experience the thrill of solving real-world challenges. Empower Students to Learn at Their Own Pace Students can try simulations as many times as they need to master content, improve grades, and stay enrolled. Boost Teaching with Active Learning Gamified assignments, contextualized scenarios, and automated assessments augment traditional teaching methods to engage learners and save faculty time. Proven Impact in STEM Courses Across Academic Institutions Labster helps teachers increase their students' knowledge and test scores. Research shows that low-knowledge students improve the most after using Labster, with a 24% increase in their test scores. Source: [BMC Study](https://www.labster.com/research/virtual-simulations-bridging-gaps-in-medical-education) 80% of students said Labster made them more likely to continue enrolling in STEM classes. Over 50% of first-year STEM students in the United States either change their majors or fail to earn their degree. Source: [LXD Study](https://www.labster.com/research/retention-study) 90% of students agreed that Labster provided opportunities for additional lab practice. Undergraduate students typically require more time to complete lab experiments than provided.
