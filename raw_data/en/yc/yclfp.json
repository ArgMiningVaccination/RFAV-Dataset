All health care clinicians in Maine involved in the EMS system and the regional EMS programs were invited to participate in the review and adoption of these protocols through their MEMS Regional Councils. The Regional Medical Directors agree that when treatments are adopted in their regions, they will be consistent with these protocols. The protocols will be continually reviewed. New or revised protocols will be listed on the Maine EMS website (maine.gov/ems). The MDPB may entertain substitutions as needed for drug shortages.

Samuel Hurley, NREMT-P Maine EMS DirectorThe Maine EMS Prehospital Treatment Protocols are dedicated to Maine's EMS clinicians, both past and present, as well as the numerous physicians, PAs, NPs, nurses and other medical personnel who have provided their time and guidance over the years to make the development of these protocols possible. This document reflects the planned review, which occurs every two years, by the Medical Direction and Practices Board. We attempt to combine the best available evidence from the current literature and medical consensus together to produce protocols that will enhance prehospital care in the State of Maine. Many individuals have spearheaded the effort for this work to become a reality. Although there are too many to mention individually, it is important to realize the common commitment shared to empower a continuously improving system where those citizens who need emergency medical assistance receive the best care possible. For those of you reading this document, please keep in mind the great commitment and sacrifice that Maine EMS clinicians make daily in the course of providing superlative prehospital care. Their work is physically, emotionally, and mentally stressful, yet 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, these individuals provide care with the skill and compassion that promises the best prehospital care for all of the citizens of Maine. What you do matters and we thank you. The 2021 Maine EMS protocols are specifically dedicated to Maine EMS clinicians' tireless response to the Coronavirus Pandemic. The MDPB and Maine EMS offers its most sincere gratitude for your dedication, service and sacrifice maintaining the health and safety of Maine citizens.

A detailed review and editing of these protocols will occur on a biennial time frame and an updated version will be released every other year. All licensed clinicians who practice within the Maine EMS system are required to be familiar with the contents of this document pertinent to their level of training. For the latest corrections/updates to these protocols, please visit the Maine EMS website at: http://www.maine.gov/ems. There are protocols within this document that are the result of the collaboration between the Northern New England States (Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont) to provide uniform, evidence-based care to our patients. These protocols are identified by a joint statement at the bottom of the protocol. E A PDenotes the scope of care for the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Denotes the scope of care for the Advanced Emergency Medical Technician Denotes the scope of care for the Paramedic Denotes a PEARL - i.e. key points/info specific to patients within the protocol Contact On-Line Medical Control Blue Underline - Text formatted as a hyperlinkLEGEND Denotes a potentially complex patient. Please call an OLMC consult to collaborate your efforts Denotes a pediatric-specific therapy or medication doseThese protocols were developed for the following reasons: 1.To provide the EMS clinician with a quick field reference, and 2.To develop written standards of care which are consistent throughout the State of Maine Users of these protocols are assumed to have knowledge of more detailed and basic patient management principles found in EMS textbooks and literature appropriate to the EMS clinician's level of training and licensure. EMS clinicians are encouraged to contact OLMC in any situation in which advice is needed, not ono, in situations as directed by these written protocols. To use these protocols as they are intended, it is necessary to know the philosophy, treatment principles, and definitions which guided the physicians and other EMS clinicians who drafted these protocols: Treatment should very RARELY delay transport! This is especially true for trauma patients, patients with chest pain, and patients with suspected stroke. IVs should be started en route except in those situations where treatment at the scene is in the patient's best interest, such as shock, prolonged extrication, or a cardiac patient when full ACLS care is available. Delays in transport should be discussed with OLMC. Inability to establish voice contact with OLMC: There are rare situations where the patient is unstable and delay in treatment threatens the patient's life or limb. If, after good faith attempts, the EMS clinician cannot contact OLMC, then the EMS clinician is authorized to use any appropriate treatment protocols as if they were standing orders. In such cases, treatments must still be consistent with the EMS clinician's training and licensure. Continue attempts to contact OLMC and document these attempts on the patient run record. Transports and transfers: During transports and transfers, ambulance crews will follow these MEMS protocols, including use of only those medications and procedures for which they are trained and authorized by protocol. Hospital destination choice: If a patient needs care which the ambulance crew, in consultation with OLMC, believes cannot be provided at the most accessible hospital, the patient will be transported to the nearest facility capable of providing that care upon the patient's arrival. If, with OLMC consultation, a patient is believed to be too unstable to survive such a diversion, then the patient will be transported to the most accessible hospital with an emergency department. Diversion is also non-binding, and if a patient insists or if the crew deems that bypass is not in the patient's best interest, then going to a hospital \"on diversion\" is appropriate. If OLMC contact is not possible, the ambulance crew is authorized to make this determination. OLMC cannot legally refuse these patients.Foreword Page 9 Brown 2 (Back to TOC)-Regional destination: Each region has the authority to develop protocols which designate the appropriate destination for patients transported from the scene. Any such protocol should be patient-centric and created exclusively to offer patients emergent care only available at selected regional sites. Examples of such protocols include the Maine EMS Trauma Triage Protocols. -Paramedics and AEMTs are expected to perform all duties in their listed scope of practice as well as those of the prior scopes of practice in the appropriate logical order. Treatments/medications should be given in the order specified. However, the MDPB recognizes that often treatments are delivered simultaneously and more than one protocol may be used. OLMC or ALS clinicians may request treatments/medications out of sequence for medical reasons. -MEMS patient/run record will be legible and thoroughly completed for each call or for each patient when more than one patient is involved in a call. This document is our legacy of patient care and holds valuable information for hospital clinicians. This information is essential to patient care and safety. Services must provide a patient care document before leaving the hospital. In MOST circumstances, this document will be a completed copy of the patient run report although, in rare circumstances, when it is not possible to complete the electronic patient care record before leaving the hospital, services may provide the hospital with a Maine EMS-approved, one page, patient care summary. THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT REPLACE THE COMPLETED RUN REPORT. These documents may become part of the patient?s hospital record and, in an effort to ensure excellent patient care, all information on this written summary must reflect the information in the electronic run report. Services must still complete the electronic patient care report and make the report available to the hospital as soon as possible. -Quality Assurance: All EMS clinicians and services must be in compliance with the Regional and State Quality Improvement Program to the satisfaction of the Regional Medical Director. -Assuming and Reassessing care already provided: EMS clinicians who will be assuming the responsibility for patient care will also be responsible for assessing the care provided before their arrival, and for all subsequent care after they arrive up to and including their level of training and licensure. If an EMS clinician has not been trained in a particular treatment listed at their level, or if that treatment is not within the EMS clinician?s scope of practice, the clinician may not perform the treatment. -If there is a Paramedic on scene that is willing to: a.Accompany the AEMT on the call, and b.Accept responsibility for the AEMT?s actions Then the Paramedic may direct the AEMT to administer medications that are within the AEMT?s scope of practice. This may be accomplished without contacting OLMC as long as the medication administration would not require OLMC for the Paramedic. If the Paramedic is unwilling to accept the above responsibilities, then the AEMT must contact OLMC before administering any medications. Foreword Page 10 Brown 3 (Back to TOC) -Carbon monoxide monitors: Carbon monoxide monitors may be used for informational purposes only. Treatment and transport decisions may not be made solely on the basis of CO readings from these monitors as they may report falsely low levels. -Medical Control permission: If a treatment is listed as requiring Medical Control permission at one level and is listed again without requiring OLMC permission at a higher level, the higher-level EMT need not seek OLMC permission. -Deviation from protocols: These protocols represent a consensus of the MDPB. In unusual situations, OLMC may deviate from these protocols if done in the patient?s best interest. The deviation in care ordered must be within the scope of practice, training and skill of the EMS clinician. The reasons for deviating from these protocols must be documented in the patient?s chart. Under such circumstances, if the ALS clinician agrees, the ALS clinician will verify and will comply with OLMC orders, will fully document the deviation on the patient run record, and will not consider the care rendered to be an emergency medical treatment to be routinely repeated. -Arrival of officially dispatched EMS personnel: Once EMS personnel have arrived on the scene, they may interact with other medical personnel on the scene who are not part of the organized EMS system responses in the following manner: -Maine EMS licensees not affiliated with one of the responding services may only provide care within their scope of practice with the approval of the ambulance crew-member in charge of the call. -The patient?s own physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner may direct care as long as they remain with the patient (in their absence, direction of care is subject only to these protocols and OLMC). You may assist this person within the scope of your practice and these protocols. Only a physician, physician assistant, or independent nurse practitioner authorized to offer OLMC by their hospital may give orders outside of the MEMS protocols. Questions in this regard should be resolved by OLMC. You may show this person Black 1, the ?Non-EMS System Medical Interveners? protocol to assist with your explanation. -Other unsolicited medical interveners must be Maine-licensed physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners or physician assistants whose assistance you request. The Black 1 ?Non-EMS System Medical Interveners? protocol describes this, and should be shown to such interveners. -Other healthcare clinicians in the home: Other healthcare clinicians in the home attending the patient (i.e. R.N., L.P.N., C.N.A., Nurse Midwife, etc.) are a valuable source of information and assistance. Any aid or treatment they wish to give must be authorized by OLMC. Any dispute over treatment or transport should be resolved by OLMC.Foreword Page 11 Brown 4 (Back to TOC)-Home healthcare devices and appliances: Patients may have devices and appliances (drains, ports, LVADs, insulin pumps, etc.) with which they are routinely discharged home. Patients (or their licensed care clinicians or previously instructed family members), are expected to maintain them on their own. These devices have some risks associated with them, but are generally considered safe in the home environment. As such, EMS clinicians are not restricted in the care or transfer of these patients based solely on the presence of these devices or appliances. If an issue arises where there is unfamiliarity with or any questions concerning these devices (which cannot be immediately resolved by the patient or caregivers), refer to OLMC. -Graduates with a current certification from a Maine EMS-approved wilderness EMT course may apply the principles of care taught in that course with the approval of the service Medical Director and when patient arrival at a definitive care setting will be more than 2 hours. -Repeated Treatment: Unless otherwise indicated, any treatment included in these protocols may be repeated after reassessment and with OLMC permission. -Oxygen supplementation will be by nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask as appropriate. -Patient Sign-Offs: There exist three origins for patient sign-offs: a.A patient refuses transport and the clinician agrees transport is not warranted b.The patient refuses transport but the clinician does not feel this is safe c.The patient requests transport but the clinician refuses (this final example is called an EMS System-initiated sign-off) Patient-initiated sign-offs should only be considered in patients with decision-making capacity and resources available to care for themselves and when non-transport is considered safe. These sign-offs do not require discussion with On-Line Medical Control. Situations in which the patient requests sign-off but the EMS clinician deems it inappropriate, please refer to OLMC. EMS System-initiated patient sign-offs (i.e. when the patient requests transfer but the EMS clinician refuses) are tremendously risky interactions and are not permissible. These sign-offs must be approved by OLMC and the service is expected to review all of these events through the service?s quality assurance mechanism. Patient care reports must be completed for all of these interactions. -Vital Signs: The MDPB believes that vital signs are essential pieces of information to be acquired on all patients. In addition, the MDPB believes that vital signs should be trended on all patients. In most cases, vital sign trending should occur every 5-10 minutes, based on the patient?s clinical status and other operational considerations. -Transfer of Care When transferring care of a patient, an on-duty EMS clinician must ensure the receiving caregiver is licensed at an equal or higher level unless the patient?s condition and reasonably anticipated complications can be effectively managed by a lower-level clinician?s scope of practice. However, a patient who receives interventions at a higher level on scene shall only have care transferred to the same or higher-level clinician.Foreword Page 12 Brown 5 (Back to TOC)-Maine EMS Special Circumstance Protocols: Maine EMS protocols are intended to address the vast majority of medical emergencies encountered by an EMS clinician. While intended to be comprehensive, certain patients exist with rare medical conditions that require highly specialized emergent care. In such situations, Maine EMS has created the ?Special Circumstance Protocols?. These are prearranged medical protocols specialized to individual patients, suggested by the patient?s medical clinician and ratified by the MDPB. Patients will present with a ?Maine EMS Special Circumstance Protocol Form? that outlines the patient?s individual protocol and is signed by the patient?s physician, the patient or their guardian, the local EMS service chief, the Regional Medical Director, and the State of Maine EMS Medical Director. These Special Circumstance Protocols should be made known to local EMS services and clinicians. In cases of question or uncertainty regarding the nature of the protocol, please refer to OLMC. -During transport, patients should be secured to the stretcher utilizing both lateral and shoulder straps. For Pediatric patient guidance, refer to Pediatric Transport Protocol, Pink 11 - 12. -Vagus Nerve Stimulators (VNS) are implanted devices that are used to treat refractory partial seizures by stimulating the vagus nerve. They are not currently approved to treat generalized seizures. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the devices provide continuous on-off cycles of vagal stimulation to prevent seizures. Patients with a VNS typically have a magnet that they can use to trigger an additional 30 second stimulation period when they feel a seizure coming on or when they are having a seizure. Caregivers are typically trained to assist with the magnet. In the event no one is available who is trained to use the magnet, the EMS clinician at any level may assist the patient if the patient can confirm that the device is a VNS and after the EMS clinician consults with OLMC. -In the critically ill patient, vascular access may be difficult to obtain. The decision on which technique to use first, IV versus IO, is based on the assessment and judgment of the clinician. Ultimately, an IV is the superior form of vascular access but the IO is appropriate for the initial resuscitation of the critically ill patient if, in the clinician?s judgment, attempts to obtain IV access would lead to an unreasonable delay in initiating fluid resuscitation. -Option to Cancel ALS policy: If the patient meets the protocol-specific cancellation criteria, the EMT and AEMT, in consultation with OLMC, may determine that it is appropriate to cancel the ALS response based on transport time, patient co-morbidities, and any other applicable factors. -All equipment referenced in these protocols must be ?Maine EMS-Approved.? In addition, it is expected that all clinicians will be appropriately trained before using any piece of equipment, device, or technique. Foreword Page 13 Brown 6 (Back to TOC)TASER PROBES The use of a TASER does not automatically necessitate an EMS response or involvement. In assessing such patients, be cognizant of the potential for underlying metabolic dysfunction. TASER probes may be removed from the subject by the deploying officer. Probes that are embedded in a sensitive area (i.e. face, neck, breast, and genital area) may need to be removed by medical personnel. In these cases, the subject should be transported to the hospital for examination and removal of the probes by medical personnel at the hospital. Other adverse effects, (i.e. respiratory difficulty, seizures, etc.) should be treated, as appropriate, by the applicable protocol(s).Definitions Page 14 Purple 1 (Back to TOC)ACLS is Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Advanced Airway means the skill of endotracheal intubation and use of other airway modalities such as Blind Insertion Airway Devices (BIAD) performed only by those who have completed practical training in each of these skills. AEMT (Advanced EMT) means the ability to provide Advanced EMT level of care (previously called Intermediate EMT). AHA is the American Heart Association ALS (Advanced Life Support) means the ability to provide advanced level of medical care, which in the prehospital realm means Paramedic. The ALS skills may include the following: IV access, advanced airway, cardiac monitoring, and/or oral or parenteral medications. ALS (Advanced Life Support), If Available means that the patient shall receive the highest appropriate ALS intervention as soon as possible. The decision in this realm as to which interventions may be appropriate rests with the Paramedic. If any skills other than basic life support are deemed necessary or initially implemented, an ALS response should be sought, with simultaneous dispatch if possible. The use of a medical priority dispatching program, approved by the State Medical Director, is encouraged. When this cannot happen, the crew in attendance should bring ALS care and the patient together in the fastest of three ways: (1) ALS back-up at the scene; (2) ALS back-up met en route; or (3) ALS by hospital staff in the emergency department if prehospital rendezvous is not possible. The BLS clinicians on the scene may modify the ALS response as appropriate. AMS refers to Altered Mental Status and AMSS refers to Altered Mental Status Scale/Score. BIADs refers to Blind Insertion Airway Devices and include periglottic (i.e. LMA) and transglottic (ie: King) devices. BP in these protocols refers to the systolic blood pressure. BSA refers to Body Surface Area and, in burn patients, can be estimated by using the Rule of 9s or patient?s hand size (palm + fingers). BVM refers to Bag-Valve-Mask ventilation CHF refers to Congestive Heart Failure, a condition in which patients may present with dyspnea, hypoxia, wheezing, and rales. CNS refers to Central Nervous System and includes the brain and spinal cord Continuous Nebulization is administration of 3 unit doses of albuterol or albuterol-ipratropium without interruption; that is, put all 3 unit doses into the nebulizer at the same time (if volume allows) and administer until complete OR administer 1 unit dose x 3 without waiting between administrations.Definitions Page 15 Purple 2 (Back to TOC)CPAP refers to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CVA refers to Cerebral Vascular Accident (stroke) DNR refers to Do Not Resuscitate DNI refers to Do Not Intubate Emergency Department means a hospital that provides an organized Emergency Service or Department that is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week and has the capability to provide On-Line Medical Control, to evaluate, treat, stabilize, and refer to an appropriate outside resource for all persons who present themselves for treatment. Emergency Medical Responder The MDPB recognizes the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) scope of practice to include the following: a.Airway management, including manual maneuvers, suctioning, application of supplemental O2, and use of the following airway adjuncts - pocket mask, OPA/NPA, BVM b.Acquisition of manual vital signs c.Application of medications for force protection only (such as the Mark 1 kit) d.Performance of manual CPR and use of AED e.Assistance in childbirth f.Manual stabilization of the cervical spine or extremity injuries g.Hemorrhage control, including use of a tourniquet h.Emergency patient moves (such as drags, carries, etc.) i.Provision of naloxone for suspected overdose j.Dispensation of naloxone as described in Yellow 4 The 2018 National Scope of Practice Updates include the following procedures to the EMR scope of practice: hemorrhage control: wound packing, placement of cervical collars, extremity splinting, and eye irrigation. Maine EMS EMRs who have been trained to perform these skills, through their primary training or Maine EMS-approved continuing medical education, may perform these skills in addition to the skills listed above. EMS Provider means any person or service licensed by Maine EMS to provide emergency medical services. End-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) is a measurement of carbon dioxide in exhaled air used to assess ventilation, also referred to as capnography. The capnography monitoring must be continuous and with a device that displays a waveform. ETT refers to Endo-Tracheal Tube Fluid Bolus indicates maximum fluid administration achievable without pumps or other special equipment in the field setting. Specifically, running a large-bore IV wide open until the desired clinical condition or blood pressure, based on the patient?s underlying condition, is achieved. A true IO bolus, at the appropriate dose with a syringe/3-way stop-cock assembly or pressure bag, is acceptable. Pediatric boluses are 20 mL/kg, and may be repeated one time if patient remains hypotensive, unless a specific alteration is noted in the protocols. Unless a specific volume of fluid is specified in the specific protocol, if the patient requires more than 40 mL/kg of IV fluid, contact OLMC to further guide fluid administration. Definitions Page 16 Purple 3 (Back to TOC)GI refers to Gastro-Intestinal tract GU refers to Genito-Urinary tract Hypoglycemia is a blood glucose less than 60 mg/dL. IM refers to Intra-Muscular route of medication administration IN refers to Intra-Nasal route of medication administration IO in these protocols, means intraosseous access. IO may be used by the Advanced EMT or Paramedic. The IO route should be considered in any patient if an IV is not established within two attempts or 90 seconds and that patient has one of the following: a.Altered mental status (GCS less than or equal to 8) b.Respiratory failure (SpO2 less than or equal to 90% after appropriate oxygen therapy, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 40 breaths per minute) with alteration of mental status c. Profound hypovolemia or hemodynamic instability with alteration of mental status or other evidence of shock ? recall, the use of an IO for volume resuscitation requires the use of a pressure bag/3-way stop-cock to achieve optimal flow rates d. Cardiac arrest (medical or traumatic) Additionally, the clinician may choose to utilize the IO route first in critical patients for whom IV access may be difficult. After discussion with OLMC, may consider IO placement for the following conditions: a.Profound hypovolemia (Systolic BP less than 90 mmHg) without alterations in mental status or other evidence of shock b.Burn patients with bilateral upper extremity burns *IO is CONTRAINDICATED in the following conditions a.Fracture of the tibia or femur in lower extremity placement or fracture of the humerus in upper extremity placement b.Infection at insertion site c.IO within the prior 24 hours in the same bone d.Knee or shoulder replacement (identified by mid-line vertical scar over the patella or anterior proximal humerus) e.Tumor near site f.Inability to locate landmarks g.Excessive tissue at insertion site h.IO access is not intended for prophylactic use Approved Sites (one per bone): Per manufacturer recommendations. Consider humeral head placement preferentially due to proximity to central circulation, particularly in OHCA patients. ContinuedDefinitions Page 17 Purple 4 (Back to TOC)IO, continued Paramedic: If infusion of medications or fluids causes significant pain, consider the following: 1.Adult: Consider lidocaine 2% (preservative free) 40 mg slow IO push over 3-4 minutes followed by 10 mL Normal Saline flush. If pain continues, contact OLMC for OPTION of additional 20 mg slow IO push. 2.Pediatric: Consider lidocaine 2% (preservative free) 0.5 mg/kg (MAX 40 mg) slow IO push over 3-4 minutes followed by 10 mL Normal Saline flush. If pain continues, contact OLMC for OPTION of additional 0.25 mg/kg (MAX 20 mg) slow IO push. IV means any balanced electrolyte solutions may be used, such as Lactated Ringers, Normal Saline and 5% Dextrose in Water. IV solutions, as defined in this document, DO NOT include other additives (such as potassium) or medications. Normal Saline is the fluid of choice for patients with history of renal failure, not Lactated Ringers. Recommended catheter size for rapid fluid resuscitation in adults is 14-18 gauge. If rapid fluid resuscitation is not required, smaller catheter sizes and heparin/saline locks may be used. Heparin used for this procedure is not considered a medication. IV Push means an expedited method of medication delivery in which a small volume of medication is administered, all at once, over a short amount of time into a vein. Recommendations for administration times are listed in specific protocols. LVAD refers to Left Ventricular Assist Device LVO refers to Large Vessel Occlusion, a type of stroke that may be amenable to fibrinolytic/endovascular therapy LOC refers to Level of Consciousness mCPR refers to mechanical CPR MDPB means Maine EMS Medical Direction and Practices Board, which consists of the six Regional Medical Directors, a physician representing the Maine Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an At-Large physician representative, a Clinical Pharmacist or Toxicologist, a BLS clinician, an ALS clinician, the State EMS Associate Medical Director and the State EMS Medical Director. Neonate is an infant less than or equal to 28 days old. NR means a non-rebreather oxygen mask. O2 means oxygen therapy as appropriate for patient. OCME refers to Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ODT refers to Orally Disintegrating Tablet, the formulation of oral ondansetron that may be administered by allowing the tablet to melt on the patient?s tongueDefinitions Page 18 Purple 5 (Back to TOC)OG refers to Oral-Gastric tube and should be considered in all intubated patients OHCA refers to Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest On-Line Medical Control (OLMC) refers to the on-line physician/physician assistant/nurse practitioner who is licensed by the State of Maine and authorized by a hospital to direct emergency medical services personnel consistent with the protocols developed by the MDPB. Other Appropriate Destination means a facility that has been approved by the Board of EMS to receive, via ambulance, patients who are in need of emergency care. Paramedic Back-up means use of an Advanced Life Support resource when a presenting patient needs more than Basic Life Support. In the prehospital setting, this indicates a Paramedic response. An ALS back-up agreement should be written between EMS provider services routinely offering and accepting ALS back-up support. This would establish medical/operational/ liability expectations of both services. These protocols cannot mandate any service to routinely offer or receive back-up. However, any decision in this regard, particularly to refuse to offer or accept ALS back-up, should be grounded in reasonable medical, operational, or financial considerations and should be reviewed by the individual service?s legal counsel. PCP refers to Primary Care Provider Pediatric Patient in these protocols, means pre-pubertal (without pubic, axillary, or facial hair). PO refers to the oral route of medication administration POLST: Provider Orders for Life-sustaining Treatment. PPE refers to Personnel Protective equipment and includes gloves, gowns, masks, respirators, eye protection.

The first class is periglottic devices, such as the LMA\u00ae and the second class is transglottic or potentially transglottic devices, such as the King LT\u00ae. Any FDA-approved devices from these classes are approved for use. A c-spine collar should be considered to help protect placement of all endotracheal intubations, periglottic and transglottic airway devices. There are periglottic devices on the market that can be used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. If these devices are placed without an attempt at endotracheal intubation, they may be treated as any other periglottic device. If they are used to assist in placing an endotracheal tube, that tube must be treated and confirmed as any other endotracheal intubation. It is recommended to have NO MORE THAN one device per class (periglottic or transglottic). Maine EMS Statement on ?Rescue? or ?Alternate?

Therefore, appropriate pain control and anxiolysis are required for all intubated patients. Signs of inadequate pain control/sedation include eye opening, coughing or gagging, sweating, tearing, new or worsening hypertension and/or tachycardia, tachypnea, or attempts to self-extubate.

May repeat x 1 in 10 minutesE A P It is important to avoid hypotension in the critically ill patient, especially post cardiac arrest and head injury. Since anxiolytics (midazolam and ketamine) can cause significant hypotension, it is recommended to treat pain first and anxiolysis (if needed) second. Anxiolysis should be treated with either midazolam OR ketamine, not a combination of the two as this could cause profound hypotension.

For patients not improving with the above measures, consider the following OPTIONS: a.Repeated or continuous albuterol by 1.Adult: IM of 1mg/1mL every 20 minutes 2.Pediatric: EPINEPHrine dose which is as follows: Less than 25 kg, 0.15 mg IM [0.15mL of 1mg/mL], Greater than 25 kg, 0.3 mg IM [0.3 mL of 1mg/mL] in anterolateral thigh every 20 minutes ii.Magnesium Sulfate 1.Adult: Magnesium Sulfate 2 grams IV/IO over 10 minutes, consider placing this medication on a pump. 2.Pediatric: Magnesium Sulfate 50 mg/kg IV/IO with a MAX dose of 2 grams over 10 minutes; consider placing this medication on a pump. *Asthmatic patients: Airway management of asthmatic patients is primarily pharmacological, not mechanical. Therefore, the focus should be on taking those actions that enable the clinician to provide inhaled bronchodilators and, in patients with severe bronchospasm, obtain rapid IV or IO access, administer IV dexamethasone, IV magnesium, and consider IM EPINEPHrine. Due to the pathophysiology of asthma, positive pressure ventilation (facemask, BIAD, or endotracheal intubation) rarely, if ever, is an effective treatment without pharmacological intervention. Therefore, unless the patient is apneic, provide supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather and focus on providing pharmacological interventions. CPAP, with the lowest PEEP setting possible, is a last resort and a bridge to intubation. Specifically, if CPAP is going to be used in the asthmatic, continuous nebs must be administered simultaneously and the clinician must be prepared to proceed with advanced airway management. Page 28 Blue 9 (Back to TOC)Respiratory Distress with Bronchospasm #3 (COPD, Emphysema, Chronic Bronchitis, Asthma) Pediatric Considerations: Wheezing in the child less than 2 years old is very commonly due to bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is a self-limited viral illness of the bronchioles, marked by edema but not smooth muscle contraction. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of wheezing in children under the age of 2. The treatment goals are to maintain oxygenation and hydration and to monitor for apnea and respiratory distress. Because the etiology is different than asthma, the treatment options are also very different. Patients suffering from bronchiolitis do not always benefit from inhaled albuterol, though a trial is appropriate. They also do not benefit from steroids. Instead, provide oxygen to ensure O2 sats greater than or equal to 90% and nasal suctioning with bulb syringe. In patients who fail these measures, consider alternate diagnosis, including stridor/croup and refer to Pink 2. Monitor for apnea or respiratory distress and, if encountered, manage the patient?s airway as indicated per Blue 3. Prehospital clinicians should consider patient age, diagnosis, transport time, clinician experience, and effectiveness of ongoing bag-mask ventilation in considering whether to continue with bag-mask ventilation versus proceeding to further airway management procedures. Bag-mask ventilation has been shown to be equivalent to endotracheal ventilation in pediatric patients in most situations with short transport times. If suspected opiate overdose, refer to the Poisoning/Overdose protocol, Yellow 1. Page 29 Blue 10 (Back to TOC)Anxiolysis in CPAP Adult patients with respiratory failure who are unable to oxygenate and ventilate often require CPAP.

Pulmonary hypertension is a disease in which a patient's pulmonary arterial pressures are elevated and can be due to multiple factors, including heart disease, chronic lung disease, or thromboembolic disease. Additionally, in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, the etiology is uncertain. Patients manifest with multiple clinical symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain and syncope. Pulmonary hypertension is NOT a disease that will be diagnosed in the prehospital setting. Increasingly, patients are being treated for the disease with medications that cause pulmonary vascular vasodilation, such as treprostinil (Remodulin). EMT Transport Destination Preferably, patients suffering from pulmonary hypertension who are treated by a specialist should be transported to the hospital managing their disease for ALL emergencies whenever feasible or operationally reasonable. If operational circumstances or the patient's needs dictate otherwise, please transport to the closest reasonable facility. Please consult OLMC for any questions. ADVANCED EMT Medication Interruption Treprostinil (Remodulin) and other medications used to treat pulmonary hypertension are provided by central access, typically through a pump. Patients are often treated with both IV and oral medications. Disruptions of the patient's IV medications can lead to increased symptoms. Most medication interruptions are NOT related to the pump, but rather the patient's central line and loss of access. In the case of interruptions of IV medication due to loss of central access: 1. Establish peripheral access PARAMEDIC 2. Verify the patient's medication and dose 3. Re-initiate the patient's medication through the newly-established peripheral access 4. Consider the transport destination suggestions as listed above. E A PEARLS FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION COMPLICATIONS Most medications used to treat pulmonary hypertension have a high pH and if left running through a peripheral line too long (greater than 4 hours) may cause peripheral vein phlebitis and sclerosis. Please document the time the medication was initiated through the peripheral line and alert treating Emergency staff. For any questions, please contact On-Line Medical Control. PPage 32 Blue 13 (Back to TOC)Surgical Cricothyrotomy #1 PThe following protocol is an effort to maintain awareness of a procedure that occurs rarely in the Maine EMS system. Ultimately, this procedure should be practiced on a regular basis to maintain proficiency. PLEASE NOTE, this protocol describes a generally acceptable open cricothyrotomy and will differ from services that employ percutaneous kits. The inclusion of this protocol DOES NOT mandate that all clinicians use this exact procedural description. Clinicians should employ the procedure they are trained, practiced and most comfortable with. This protocol is one of multiple acceptable means to perform this procedure. Regardless of the procedure type, it is essential that Maine EMS paramedics are familiar with the available supplies and materials. The primary indication for surgical cricothyrotomy is failure to maintain the airway (including oxygenation, ventilation, and protection) through other, less invasive means in a patient 8 years or older with palpable landmarks. In the Maine EMS experience, this has occurred predominantly in trauma cases with disruption of the face and normal airway anatomy and in choking patients. Even in some dramatic facial injuries, the airway may be adequately managed by sitting the patient up and leaning forward, as long as the other injury patterns allow. Materials/Equipment for Surgical Cricothyrotomy 1.Cuffed tracheostomy tube or 6.0 - 7.0 ETT 2.Tracheal hook or bougie 3.Trousseau dilator (if available) 4.Syringe to inflate cuff 5. Scalpel (No. 11 blade) 6.Umbilical tape or other means to secure tracheostomy tube or ETT 7.4x4 gauze Page 33 Blue 14 (Back to TOC)Surgical Cricothyrotomy #2 Procedure: 1.Extend the neck when possible to ensure best access to the trachea. Swab/cleanse the area. 2.Immobilize the trachea with your non-dominant thumb and middle finger while palpating the cricothyroid membrane with your non-dominant index finger. NOTE: The cricothyroid membrane is immediately BELOW the thyroid cartilage. 3.Make a 3 - 5 cm vertical incision over the cricothyroid membrane through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. NOTE: Severe bleeding is possible with this procedure and may occur at this or the following steps. Be prepared to suction and provide direct pressure to control bleeding 4.Palpate the membrane through the incision to confirm anatomy. 5.Make a small (1 cm or less) incision horizontally through the cricothyroid membrane. 6.Insert the tracheal hook or bougie in the opening of the membrane and rotate toward the head while maintaining hold of the thyroid cartilage with your non-dominant hand. 7.If Trousseau dilator available, insert into the incision site and spread vertical then rotate 90 degrees until the dilator is parallel with the neck. 8.Insert the cuffed tracheostomy tube or ETT tube into the incision site. Advance until the flanges rest on the skin of the neck (when using tracheostomy tube). 9.Carefully remove the dilator (if used), tracheal hook and obturator of the tracheostomy tube. 10.Inflate the balloon of the tracheostomy tube/ETT. 11.Ventilate and confirm position by physical exam and ETCO2. 12.Secure the tube in place. 13.Dress incision site. PPage 34 Blue 15 (Back to TOC)Tracheostomy Care #1 EA PIndication: An adult or pediatric patient with an established tracheostomy with signs of respiratory distress or failure. Procedure: 1.Consult the patient's caregiver for assistance. 2.Assess the tracheostomy tube looking for easily reversible causes of distress, including detached oxygen source, plugging, etc. 3.Administer high-flow O2 over the tracheostomy via non-rebreather mask or blow by. 4.If patient's respiratory distress continues, assist ventilation using a bag-valve-mask to the tracheostomy tube. 5.Suction the tracheostomy tube if unable to ventilate with BVM, course upper airway sounds or if respiratory distress continues despite BVM ventilation a.Use the patient's suctioning supplies or a tube that is no more than 1/2 the diameter of the tracheostomy tube. b.Use no more than 80 mmHg suction pressure in pediatric patients and 150 mmHg in adults c.If tracheostomy tube has a cannula, remove it prior to suctioning d.Determine the proper suction catheter depth by measuring the obturator. If no obturator is available, insert the suction catheter 2-3 inches into the tracheostomy tube. DO NOT force the suction catheter into the tracheostomy tube. e.Pre-oxygenate when possible for 30-60 seconds then insert the suction catheter to the desired depth. Apply suctioning while removing the catheter. Gently rotate the catheter while withdrawing. This should take 10 - 15 seconds. 6.Consider using 2 - 3 mL of saline or nebulized saline to help loosen thick secretions 7.If respiratory distress continues, consider likely cause and reference appropriate protocol In the case of an adult or pediatric patient with established tracheostomy tube (greater than 1-2 weeks old), in respiratory distress or failure in which the above measures have not succeeded in improving respiratory status, consider replacing the tracheostomy tube. This protocol may also be appropriate for patients with dislodged tracheostomy tubes. PEARLS FOR TRACHEOSTOMY CARE There are many types of tracheostomy tubes on the market. One of the most common types is the Shiley. These tracheostomy tubes have an inner and outer cannula. PLEASE NOTE: only the inner cannula has a 15 mm adapter that will fit a BVM, the outer cannula will not. The inner cannula MUST be in place to ventilate the patient ANY bleeding from the tracheostomy site should be evaluated emergently. Follow the Hemorrhage/Hemorrhagic Shock protocols, Green 15 - 18, AND, in the case of severe hemorrhage from the tracheostomy site, hyperinflate the tracheostomy cuff with 50 mL of air, in an effort to tamponade the bleeding vessel. Inflate slowly, to prevent cuff rupture. Depending on the make and model of the tube, inflating the entire 50 mL may not be possible.

If the tracheostomy is less than 2 weeks old, the track is immature and there is risk of creating a false lumen if attempts to replace or change the tracheostomy are made.PIndication for Tracheostomy Replacement: An adult or pediatric patient with an established tracheostomy (greater than 2 weeks old) with signs of respiratory distress or failure that have not improved with measures listed on the previous page. Also, for patients dislodged tracheostomy. If tracheostomy tube is less than 2 weeks old, refer to Blue 3 and attempt to secure airway from above. Necessary Equipment: -Replacement tracheostomy tube, if available (from the patient or care giver) -If no replacement tracheostomy tube is available, an ETT of similar internal diameter (see below) -If possible, water-based lubricant jelly Procedure: 1.Place the patient on high-flow O2 and monitor 2.Place patient in a semi-recumbent position with the neck slightly extended 3.Remove old stoma dressing and clean the site 4.Lubricate the new tracheostomy tube or replacement ETT 5.Deflate the old tracheostomy tube's balloon and remove during exhalation 6.Using the replacement tracheostomy tube's obturator, insert the replacement tube at a 90 degree angle to the cervical axis. 7.Next, gently advance the replacement tracheostomy tube in a fluid fashion, using the natural curvature of the tube until the flange is flush against the neck. 8.Remove the obturator if using a replacement tracheostomy tube and insert the hollow internal cannula. 9.If using an ETT as replacement, remove the old tracheostomy tube as described above, insert a bougie into the stoma directed downward. Slowly advance the lubricated ETT into the stoma. RECALL, when using an ETT as replacement, it need only be advanced a few centimeters into the stoma. Consider shortening the ETT by cutting the tube AFTER the takeoff for the balloon inflation. 10.Inflate the cuff of the replacement tracheostomy tube or ETT 11.Secure the device to the patient's neck. Page 36 Red 1 (Back to TOC)For all patients with chest pain, evaluation for acute coronary syndrome should occur. Commonly, it is difficult with the tools available to EMS clinicians to completely rule out a cardiac cause of chest pain. Therefore, all patients should be transported for emergency medical evaluation. Cardiac disease is but one of the many causes of chest pain and the EMS clinician should consider various causes such as esophageal, chest wall, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, spontaneous pneumothorax, etc. Patients commonly fall into one of three categories: suspected cardiac, traumatic, or uncertain cause of chest pain. ***The cardiac monitor/defibrillator should be brought to the patient's side during the initial assessment. ***Chest Pain - General Chest Pain Suspected Cardiac Origin, follow Red 2 Traumatic, follow Green 10Uncertain Etiology, follow Red 6 Consider cardiac origin chest pain in the following: -Chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body (i.e. arm, jaw, epigastrium), shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. -Atypical or unusual symptoms are more common in women, the elderly and patients with diabetes.

Refer to Adult Post-Resuscitation Care protocol, Red 16 b. Contact OLMC for options of: i. Post-resuscitation amiodarone bolusP Pearls for Cardiac Arrest: Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies for the patient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as: a.A rate of 100 - 120 compressions/minute b.Depth of between 2 - 2.5 inches c.Allow for complete chest recoil d.Minimize interruptions in compressions e.Rotate rescuers every 2 minutes f.Avoid respiratory rate greater than 10/min g.Quantitative end-tidal CO2 should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest compressions. If ETCO2 is < 10 mmHg, attempt to improve chest compression quality h.Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback Resuscitate on scene as the effectiveness of chest compressions decreases during any patient movement. Resuscitation on scene should be the goal, with the only exceptions being safety concerns for the responding crew OR inability to effectively resuscitate in the patient's current location.Page 45 Red 10 (Back to TOC)Cardiac Arrest #3 Pearls for Cardiac Arrest, continued: All services MUST have an organized and structured response to the care of patients in cardiac arrest. This approach must be pre-arranged and may be modeled on the Maine EMS ICS for OHCA Program or other well-accepted structured approach to patient care. Also, EMS services are encouraged to train clinicians to these systems of care and to regularly train clinicians in high-performance CPR. Use capnography during resuscitation for confirmation and monitoring of advanced airways and for prolonged use of BVM as well as monitoring effectiveness of chest compression and return or loss of spontaneous circulation. Note: The algorithms for cardiac arrest or arrhythmias reflect the MEMS Medical Direction and Practices Board's interpretation of ACLS guidelines, as they should be used in the prehospital setting. In OHCA patients consider humeral head placement preferentially due to proximity to central circulation. Classes of common sodium channel blockers include cause of cardiac arrest in the following clinical settings: aspirin overdose, severe diabetic ketoacidosis, severe sepsis, and excited delirium. In the case of peripartum cardiac arrest, provision of high-quality CPR remains a priority. If a patient's fundus height is at or above the level of the umbilicus, manual uterine displacement to either the left or right is the preferred method of relieving aortocaval compression during chest compressions. Additionally, local hospital resources for advanced care should be activated immediately upon recognition of peripartum cardiac arrest. Contact OLMC to discuss the potential of additional therapies. Pediatric cardiac dysfunction is usually due to a respiratory cause and is thus more likely to initially respond to effective oxygenation and ventilation followed by fluid administration and then medications. Defibrillation alone is rarely successful. It is also prudent to consider foreign body airway obstructions given the age of the patient. Page 46 Red 11 (Back to TOC)Cardiac Arrest #4 (Mechanical CPR Devices) 1. Mechanical CPR (mCPR) devices are not mandatory devices, but may play a role in three prehospital cardiac arrest settings, including: a. Resuscitation events with few numbers of rescuers, b. Resuscitation events that are prolonged, c. Resuscitation events occurring during transport. 2. Manual CPR MUST remain the FIRST strategy for chest compressions as manual CPR is the most readily available and effective compression strategy in the vast majority of cases. 3. If applied, a mCPR device should be placed in a manner which minimizes interruptions, keeping all breaks in CPR to less than 10 seconds. 4. Application Process -- Upon encountering a patient in cardiac arrest: a. Initiate manual CPR b. Continue manual CPR for a minimum of 2 two-minute cycles. Placement or implementation of mechanical CPR may not begin until AFTER the 2nd cycle of CPR. c. If the responding EMS service chooses to implement mechanical CPR, placement may begin AFTER the second cycle of CPR and must be applied in a manner that coordinates with pulse/rhythm checks AND keeps all breaks in CPR to less than 10 seconds. d. Apply the device in accordance to manufacturer?s instructions. e. It is possible that application of the device, in a manner that is coordinated with pulse/rhythm checks and maintains interruptions in CPR less than 10 seconds, may take an additional 2 or more cycles of CPR, leading to initiation of mechanical CPR after the 4th round of manual CPR. 5. Contraindications to Mechanical CPR a. Age less than 18. b. Patients who are unable to fit into the device due to body habitus. 6. In addition to the above, mechanical CPR devices may be placed prior to transport in patients that have recently achieved ROSC in the event of rearrest. The device should be in ?stand-by? mode and activated if patient re-arrests en route to the hospital. 7. All Maine EMS clinicians should be trained in High Performance CPR and Incident Command for Cardiac Arrest. 8. Mechanical CPR devices should ONLY be used by clinicians who have been trained to use the devices and can apply the devices while maintaining all breaks in CPR to 10 seconds or less. 9. Additionally, Maine EMS clinicians should routinely practice High Performance CPR, Incident Command for Cardiac Arrest and, if the service chooses, placement and use of mechanical CPR devices. The frequency of such training is difficult for the MDPB to determine for each individual service. Ultimately, this number will be determined by multiple factors, including the size of the service and the service's annual number of resuscitation attempts. As a guide, some of the EMS services with the highest survival from witnessed VF arrest perform resuscitation training (including high performance CPR and ICS for cardiac arrest) 2-4 times a year. Please consult with your service medical director and QI program to assist in determining the proper frequency of trainings for your service. EAPPage 47 Red 12 (Back to TOC)Pediatric Cardiac Medications & Dosages Prehospital clinicians should consider patient age, diagnosis, transport time, clinician experience, and effectiveness of ongoing bag-valve-mask ventilation in considering whether to continue with bag-valve-mask ventilation versus proceeding to endotracheal intubation. Bag-valve-mask ventilation has been shown to be equivalent to endotracheal ventilation in pediatric patients in most situations with short transport times. Atropine (Indication: Bradycardia) IV/IO: 0.02 mg/kg Minimum dose: 0.1 mg MAX single dose: 0.5 mg (child) May repeat once EPINEPHrine 1 mg/10 mL (Indication: Bradycardia) IV/IO: 0.01 mg/kg mL/kg) (Indication: VF/VT)IV/IO: 5 mg/kg bolus MAX single dose: 300 mg Can repeat in 3-5 minutes up to total dose of 15 mg/kg. Sodium Bicarbonate (Indications: wide complex PEA suggesting hyperkalemia or sodium channel blocker overdose) Common sodium tegretol, bolus MAX single dose: 50 mEq Repeat every 5 minutes until QRS duration is less than 120 msec dose: 2 g Gluconate Cardiac Arrest Suspected due to Hyperkalemia) IV/IO: 60 mg/kg push over 1 minute MAX single dose: 3000 mg Repeat in 10 minutes Synchronized Cardioversion: 0.5 - 1.0 J/kg (initial); 2 J/kg 6 13 (Back to TOC)Refractory VF/VT Refractory VF/VT after 3 unsuccessful shocks and administration EPINEPHrine and amiodarone, consider the following steps: 1.Vector Change: apply a second set of pads. If first set was in the anterior-apex position (blue pads in figure), place a second set in the anterior-posterior position (red pads). Do not allow the pads to touch one another. 2.Ensure adequate pad contact: i.e. pressure on pads with a barrier such as a stack of folded towels. Reassess for adequate pad contact before each defibrillation. 3.If the above steps fail to convert to sinus rhythm, consider dual-sequential external defibrillation. a.This can only be performed with MANUAL defibrillators. ****Check with the manufacturers of your manual defibrillators re: the warranty if used in dual-sequential external defibrillation**** b. Assure that controls for the second manual defibrillator are accessible to the team leader c. Verify that both cardiac manual defibrillators are attached to the patient, that all pads are well-adhered, and simultaneously charge both manual defibrillators d. When both defibrillators are charged to maximum energy settings and all persons are clear, push one shock button followed by the other immediately after the first shock is delivered. e. May repeat procedure every 2 minutes as indicated if refractory VF/VT persists-Recurrent VF/VT is defined as SUCCESSFULLY CONVERTED by standard defibrillation techniques but subsequently returns. It should NOT be treated by dual sequential defibrillation (DSD). It is managed by treatment of correctable causes and use of anti-arrhythmic medications in addition to standard defibrillation. -Refractory VF/VT is defined as NOT CONVERTED by standard defibrillation. It is initially managed by treating correctable causes with anti-arrhythmic medications. If these methods fail to produce a response, the below therapies may be beneficial. APPage 49 Red 14 (Back to TOC)Termination of Resuscitation #1 Resuscitation should be withheld under the following circumstances: -When it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST form, etc.), Grey 1 -Scene Safety: the physical environment is not safe for the clinician(s) -When irreversible signs of death, such as rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, decomposition, incineration, other obvious lethal injuries are present. -When down time has been unknown or greater than 20 minutes with no bystander CPR performed and the patient is cool to touch (not from exposure), no audible heart sounds, and fixed/dilated pupils. Resuscitation may be terminated: -When the patient regains pulse/respirations -When the rescuers are physically exhausted or when equally or more highly trained health care personnel take over -In the absence of ALS, when the same Maine EMS licensed crew member has determined the absence of vital signs for 20 minutes, in spite of BLS, except in the case of hypothermia, see Hypothermia protocol, Yellow 12 -When it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST form, etc.), Grey 1 -When the following time frames have been met for ALS clinicians alone: -Persistent asystole x 20 minutes -Slow and/or wide complex PEA x 20 minutes -Fast/narrow PEA x 45 minutes -VF/Pulseless VT x 60 minutes -If ALS clinicians arrive on scene of a patient managed by BLS clinicians, consider TOR if: -After a total (BLS + ALS) resuscitation time of 20 minutes, the AED has never advised shock AND the first rhythm noted by ALS clinicians is asystole or slow/wide PEA -If patient is found in fast/narrow PEA does not achieve ROSC after 45 minutes of ALS + BLS care -If the patient is found in VF/Pulseless VT does not achieve ROSC after 60 minutes of ALS+BLS care -In the case of fast/narrow PEA and VF/Pulseless VT, the ALS clinician must complete the ALS algorithm as dictated in these protocols prior to consideration of TOR, regardless of time frame If Resuscitative Efforts are terminated: 1.Focus attention on the family or bystanders. Explain the rationale for termination 2.Consider accessing support for family: other family, friends, or social support such as clergy 3.If termination of resuscitation occurs, one must consider management of the patient's remains. No one option is correct for all circumstances; factors on scene will likely dictate the best option. Refer to Grey 4. If questions remain regarding disposition of the patient's remains, contact OLMC. In the event that a patient arrests or re-arrests after leaving the scene and resuscitative efforts are unsuccessful, continue non-emergent transport to the hospital for disposition of the patient remains and family notification. This pathway should also be considered when termination of resuscitation occurs in unsafe or undesirable locations. Please discuss and pre-plan with local hospitals to ensure that all local systems are involved. *Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is dangerous to the crew, pedestrians and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient during ambulance transport. If circumstances do not allow TOR for safety or other reasons, notify OLMC.Page 50 Red 15 (Back to TOC)Termination of Resuscitation #2 Termination of resuscitation is an important aspect of the medical care of the cardiac arrest patient. When resuscitative efforts have failed to be successful, compassionately transferring attention to the patient's surviving loved ones and ensuring proper final care of the deceased are essential. Please recall from the 2011 Maine EMS Protocol Update that those final steps in care for the deceased include the following: 1) Notification of the family ? May have already occurred. However, if the patient passes away without family or friends present, contingencies for family notification must be made. 2) Disposition of Patient Remains ? There are multiple options for disposition of patient remains which include local funeral homes, the local ED, the local hospital?s morgue, the Medical Examiner's office, etc. It is essential that your service partners with local hospitals, local police, and local funeral homes to facilitate this process. Please refer to the Maine EMS 2011 EMS Protocol FAQ sheet. 3) Notification of the patient?s PCP (if the patient has one) and the Medical Examiner 4) Signing the patient?s death certificate ? Only a physician with a relationship to the patient (PCP or treating physician ? includes an emergency physician resuscitating the patient) or the Medical Examiner can sign the death certificate. 5) Notification the New England Donor Services at 1-800-446-6362 with the following information; patient's name, date of birth, location of arrest, your contact phone number, and time of death.

Magnesium sulfate 1-2 grams IV over 5 minutes Treatment of pre-excitation rhythms (such as WPW) include blocking at the level of the AV node, using adenosine or beta-blockers. Patients with pre-excitation AND A-fib should NOT receive any agents that block the AV node, as this could cause VF. WPW with A-fib may be recognized by a very fast rhythm, a predominance of wide QRS complexes with occasional narrow complexes and an irregular rhythm. When WPW with A-fib is suspected, the patient should NOT receive any medications that block the AV node because this will force all impulses through the accessory pathway and can cause VF. Instead, these patients should be cardioverted when they become unstable. Do NOT give adenosine to a patient with Polymorphic VT or Torsades.

Proceed to pacing, vasopressor infusion, or both* Examples of circumstances leading to increased vagal tone include the following: cholinergic medications (phenylephrine, neostigmine), sedatives (morphine) and nasopharangeal or esophageal stimulation (eg. due to gastric reflux, breath holding, vomiting, coughing, intubation, placement of nasopharangeal tube, suctioning, etc.)E A PPage 56 Red 21 (Back to TOC)Bradycardia #2 Heart rate less than 50 beats/min PEARLS for Bradycardia: Consider causes of bradycardia: MI, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, sick sinus overdose (calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, digoxin, organophosphates), hyperkalemia (in wide complex). Application of TCP should be considered if deterioration is anticipated because of the following: a. Observed sinus pauses b. Episodes of 2nd degree Type II, or 3rd degree AV Block Pre-medication for TCP is preferably via the IV route. If unable to obtain IV, may try IN route in the cooperative patient with goal of ultimately obtaining IV/IO access. Bradycardia in the Post-Arrest Patient: Post-ROSC bradycardia is a peri-arrest state. For the patient who has achieved ROSC and becomes bradycardic, be very cautious. Typically, these causes do not respond durably to transcutaneous pacing alone. In addition to transcutaneous pacing, consider early initiation of NOREPInephrine and refer to the post arrest protocol. Check mechanical capture every 2 minutes and restart CPR if no pulse is detected.Continued from Previous Page: PARAMEDIC 10. If continued signs or symptoms, consider: a. Repeat atropine or b. EPINEPHrine IV infusion, which may typically be dosed the following way: i. Adult: 1. Preparation - Add 1mL (1mg) of EPINEPHrine 1mg/mL to 250 mL bag NS. This results in a 1 mg/250 mL = 4 mcg/mL mix. 2. Dose - Start at 0.05 mcg/kg/min. Titrate by 0.05 mcg/kg/min every 5 min. Titrate to desired desired effect which may include resolution of bradycardia, SPB of > 90 mmHg and/or MAP > 65 mmHg. Usual dose is 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min. Absolute maximum dose is 0.5 mcg/kg/min c.

Perform 12-lead ECGVentricular Assist Devices #2 AP PEARLS for VADs -You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries in order to defibrillate or cardiovert. -You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries in order to acquire a 12-lead ECG. -Automatic non-invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse pressure created by the continuous flow pump. -Flow through many VAD devices is not pulsatile and patients may not have a palpable pulse or accurate pulse oximetry. The blood pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion. Although automatic non-invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring systolic and diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accurate. Doppler?s may be more accurate at determining both pulse and blood pressure and, if available, should be used. -Patient may be awake with a functioning pump in VF, VT, PEA or asystole. If the patient is responsive AND the encountered rhythm is thought to be new, ACLS therapies, including defibrillation may be attempted, however chest compressions are not necessary if the patient is awake and alert. Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD coordinator. -The patient?s emergency travel bag should accompany him/her at all times. If feasible, bring the patient?s Power Module, cable and Display Module with patient to the hospital. -The most common cause for VAD alarms are low batteries or battery failures -Primary pump failure is a very rare occurrence. The most common VAD complications, in on the patient's clinical condition. -For questions, contact OLMC and the patient's VAD Coordinator. -All with a VAD are anticoagulated, typically with warfarin (Coumadin).Page 61 Red 26 (Back to TOC)Hyperkalemia #1 Hyperkalemia (elevated serum potassium levels) can become a life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which causes changes in the electrical system of the heart potentially leading to fatal arrhythmias. While serum electrolyte values are not routinely available in the prehospital setting, a paramedic can identify the electrical changes on ECG and initiate prompt treatment. Patients at highest risk of cardiac consequences of hyperkalemia are those in renal failure: either end stage kidney disease requiring dialysis or with acute decompensations in renal function. The most common at-risk patient is the dialysis dependent patient who has missed one or more scheduled dialysis sessions and thus has accumulated dangerously high levels of electrolytes, including potassium. There are also a number of prescription medications that can alter serum potassium levels such as diuretics, blood pressure medications, chemotherapy agents, and more. Electrocardiographic signs of hyperkalemia include the following: 1.Obtain 12-lead ECG and evaluate for signs of hyperkalemia, including peaked T waves, widened QRS, lengthened QT interval, loss of P waves. 2. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring 3. Establish 2 points of IV/IO access 4. If ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia are noted, administer: a. IV/IO fluid bolus: 500 - 1000 mL (NS or LR) b. Calcium gluconate - NOTE: DO NOT administer Calcium through same IV/IO as Sodium Bicarbonate i. Adult: 2 grams diluted in 50-100 mL NS or D5W IV/IO over 10 minutes ii. Pediatric: 60mg/kg diluted in 50-100 mL NS or D5W (with MAX dose of 2 grams) IV/IO over 10 minutes c. Sodium bicarbonate - NOTE: DO NOT administer Sodium Bicarbonate through same i. Adult: 50mEq IV/IO ii. Pediatric: 1mEq/kg over MAX dose of 50mEq (8.4% sodium bicarbonate must be diluted with D5W to 4.2% [0.5 mEq/mL] prior to administration in patients less than 2 years of age.) d. Albuterol i. Adult: 15 mg via nebulizer ii. Pediatric: 1. Pediatric less than 25 kg - 2.5 mg via nebulizer 2. Pediatric greater than 25 kg - 5 mg via nebulizer 5.

Patients presenting with elevated serum potassium levels based on outpatient/hospital lab testing do not warrant treatment unless ECG changes are present. If elevated serum potassium levels are noted on laboratory testing, obtain 12-lead ECG and perform continuous cardiac monitoring to evaluate for electrical changes. -These can be dynamic situations. Monitor QRS complexes closely after therapy. If initial improvement, but recurrence of QRS changes, please re-initiate protocol. -The treatment of hyperkalemia is based on several mechanisms: -Dilution: of potassium with stabilization: calcium gluconate stabilizes the electrical conduction system of the heart, making it less susceptible to electrolyte disturbance -Potassium shift: albuterol and sodium bicarbonate can temporarily shift potassium ions from the serum into cells, thus reducing the serum potassium level. The half-life of albuterol is short, but may temporarily improve serum potassium levels while the other treatments take effect.Continued from previous page 7.

PEARLS for Allergy/Anaphylaxis Children with a known, recent exposure to common triggers of allergic reactions (peanuts, medications, bee stings) should be considered at risk for having an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Children with asthma should be considered high risk for a severe reaction. Anaphylaxis in children should be treated for those exhibiting hypotension after exposure to a known allergen, respiratory compromise with acute onset of skin or mucosal involvement, or two or more of the following after exposure to a likely allergen: gastrointestinal symptoms, skin/mucosal involvement, respiratory compromise, or hypotension. Severity should be differentiated between anaphylaxis and non-anaphylaxis (ie: Allergic reaction only). Only patients with anaphylaxis (as defined in Gold 3) should receive EPINEPHrine. Evidence suggests that the incidence of anaphylaxis is under recognized. Please consider the definitions of anaphylaxis (on the following page) and treat all cases of anaphylaxis with EPINEPHrine. Evidence does not support the routine use of cardiac monitoring for patients who receive one dose of EPINEPHrine. PPage 65 Gold 3 (Back to TOC)Allergy/Anaphylaxis #3 PEARLS for Allergy/Anaphylaxis: 1. Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any ONE of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled: Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND at least ONE of the following: a. Respiratory compromise (eg, Expiratory Flow end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) OR TWO or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch- flush, swollen lips, tongue-uvula) Respiratory (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow, symptoms incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) (several hours) OR Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours) a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that person?s baseline 2. In every case when anaphylaxis is identified, EPINEPHrine should be provided. The best route of administration is via the IM route in the anterolateral thigh 3. Patients may require repeated doses EPINEPHrine. These repeated doses are also provided via the IM route 4. DO NOT administer IM EPINEPHRrine concentration (1mg/1mL) via the IV route. Page 66 Gold 4 (Back to TOC)Allergy/Anaphylaxis #4 IV EPINEPHrine infusion drip, administered via a Maine EMS approved medication pump, should be started for patients unresponsive to IM EPINEPHrine administration in either of the following settings: -Cardiovascular collapse (hypotension with altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis, or delayed capillary refill) OR -Hypotension that is unresponsive to a total of 60 mL/kg (3 x 20 mL/kg boluses) isotonic fluid boluses and repeat doses of IM EPINEPHrine Evidence does not support the prophylactic use of EPINEPHrine in the asymptomatic patient after exposure to a known allergen. Children experiencing cutaneous signs of an allergic reaction with no systemic symptoms should be evaluated by a medical clinician. Children experiencing anaphylaxis in the prehospital setting who receive EPINEPHrine require EMS transport.

If the witness can not come with you, obtain the witness' best phone number and relay to receiving hospital staff. -Time Last Known Well is the last time the patient was noted to be neurologically normal. If the patient was sleeping and wakes up with symptoms, time last known well is the last time the patient was seen to be normal. Check if the patient had gotten up and been at baseline during the night. -Suspect stroke in patients with any of the following new symptoms or complaints: acute visual disturbance, altered mental state, difficulty with balance or coordination, difficulty with speech or understanding, severe headache, weakness or numbness on one side. Stroke should be suspected whenever a person has a sudden change in neurological function. More common symptoms of stroke are weakness or loss of sensation of the face, a limb or a side of the face or body, abnormal speech production (slurred or inappropriate use of words) or comprehension, dizziness/vertigo, uncoordinated movements of a limb, gait disturbance, loss of vision in one eye or one side of vision and/or sudden onset severe headache for no obvious reason. -Consider stroke mimics including: migraine, hypoglycemia, seizures, intoxication, sepsis. -The management of an LVO stroke is a COMBINATION of rapid provision of tPA AND endovascular therapies when a patient screens positive for an LVO stroke that is amenable for therapy. At present, BOTH therapies should be performed in as rapid as possible manner, highlighting the role of ALL hospitals in the care of stroke patients.

Inquire about traditional anticoagulants including warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) and Heparin (IV/IM - including Lovenox) note, medication manufacturers are producing new anticoagulants frequently. Please note all medications the patient identifies as an anticoagulant and pass on to receiving hospital staff. Time of symptom onset/Time Last Known Well: ___________ Yes No Has the patient had any recent trauma, surgeries or procedures in the last 3 months? If Yes, what was the procedure and when did it occur? Including: 1) Severe head trauma within the past 3 months 2) Intracranial or spinal surgery within the past 3 months 3) Major non-cranial surgery or trauma within 14 days with uncontrollable bleeding (e.g. internal organs) Has the patient had any bleeding problems in the past? If Yes, what was the bleeding problem and when did it occur? Including: 1) History of spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracranial hemorrhage 2) GI malignancy or GI bleed within in the past 21 days Is the patient taking any anticoagulants, including oral or injectable medications? If Yes, clarify what the medication is and when it was last administered. See below lists of common anticoagulants This list represents a simplified approach to contraindications to tPA and should be inquired of all patients with suspected stroke. These are important to hospital clinicians determining eligibility for tPA AND when determining entry destination for possible LVO Strokes (referred to in the algorithm as 3tPA ?'s) Please present these findings to the Emergency Medicine Staff at the receiving hospital. The patient's Last Known Well and the answers to these three questions identify the vast majority of ABSOLUTE contraindications for tPA.

If no response to initial treatment: initiate NOREPInephrine IV infusion. NOREPInephrine infusions must be administered via a Maine EMS approved medication pump. i. Preparation ? mix NOREPInephrine 8 mg in 250 mL NS [32 mcg/mL] ii. Dosing - Starting dose of NOREPInephrine is 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Titrate by 0.03 mcg/kg/min every 3-5 minutes. Usual dose is 0.03-0.25 mcg/kg/min. Usual MAX dose is 0.6 mcg/kg/min. Absolute MAX dose is 3 mcg/kg/min. iii. Titrate to maintain SBP greater than 90 mmHg and/or MAP > 65 mmHg 8. Additionally, if the patient is found to have Adrenal Insufficiency (via medic alert bracelet, patient records, or family/staff reports), administer dexamethasone as follows: a. Adults ? dexamethasone 10 mg IV/IO/IM x 1 dose b. Pediatrics - 0.6 mg/kg with MAX single dose of 10 mg IV/IO/IM x 1 dose c. May provide patient?s own dose of hydrocortisone (Solu-cortef) at the patient?s physician's prescribed dose if patient's medications are availableP PEARLS for Sepsis: -Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response due to infection, often resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. -Septic shock has a 50% mortality rate and must be treated aggressively. -Treatment consisting of IV fluid administration and early antibiotic administration reduces mortality in septic patients. -Please alert the receiving hospital with patients identified as septic. -Current evidence suggests there may be a benefit from use of Lactated Ringers in critically ill patients with shock. Consider using Lactated Ringers preferentially if available. -When initiating NOREPInephrine, make sure that the IV flushes easily and that there is NO extravasation. Whenever possible, use proximal IV access. -Patients suffering from sepsis or septic shock are very ill patients and the care of these patients may be nuanced. Please consider the value of On Line Medical Control discussion for any questions or concerns regarding the management of these patients.

The earliest signs and symptoms of pediatric shock include delayed capillary refill, alterations in mental status, rising pulse, and increasing respiratory rate. By the time blood pressure drops, circulatory collapse is near. Consider sepsis in certain high-risk clinical settings. High-risk features for invasive infection include malignancy, bone marrow or solid organ transplant, asplenia, presence of indwelling central line/catheter, or other situation with immune deficiency, compromise or suppression. Please see below for pediatric specific findings & vital signs.

Mortality is increased if this is not addressed. Also, the presenting symptoms of shock and those of hypoglycemia can be very similar. In children under the age 6, prompt IO placement after one failed IV attempt should be considered, since timely, successful IV placement in this age group is shown to be difficult. Patients in shock require frequent reassessment. The following physiologic parameters are appropriate endpoints for therapy: normalization of heart rate, capillary refill, mental status, resolution of existing hypotension and, if available, presence of urine output. PPage 80 Gold 18 (Back to TOC) Abdominal Pain E A PMany diseases cause abdominal pain. While it is almost impossible to diagnose the cause of abdominal pain in the EMS environment, it is important to be prepared for the patient to suddenly become very ill.

In cases of pregnancy with either vaginal bleeding or abdominal/pelvic pain, consider the following possibilities: 1. Abruptio placenta: placenta prematurely separates from the uterus causing intrauterine bleeding 2. Placenta previa: placenta covers part or all of the cervical opening 3. Ectopic pregnancy (ruptured) 4. Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) 5. Pre-Eclampsia/Eclampsia (can occur for up to 6 weeks post partum) 6. Postpartum Hemorrhage EMT 1. Manage airway as appropriate, see Blue 3 2. Monitor vitals. If evidence of shock refer to the Hemorrhagic Shock protocol, Green 16. Contact ALS, if available a. Patients in third trimester of pregnancy with evidence of shock should be transported on the side (either left or right), or with uterus manually displaced to the left or right 3. If the patient is pregnant with abdominal/pelvic pain, bleeding or concern for any of the above conditions, and the patient condition permits, transport to the nearest hospital with OB capabilities if total transport time is less than 45 minutes, otherwise go to the closest ED. 4. For trauma related to pregnancy, follow Trauma Triage, Green 3 5. Notify Hospital of incoming patient 6. Contact OLMC for decision support if questions regarding patient transport destination. ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 7. Establish IV. If evidence of shock, resuscitate with fluid boluses 8. If history of syncope/lightheadedness, perform 12 lead ECG PARAMEDIC 9. For patients suffering post partum hemorrhage and demonstrating evidence of shock, refer to the Hemorrhagic shock protocol and consider TXA. a. NOTE - TXA is contraindicated in patients greater than 24 wks pregnant (or pregnant with fundus above umbilicus) suffering hemorrhagic shock due to trauma (see Green 17) Pearls for Obstetric Emergencies Even minor trauma beyond the second trimester can lead to significant consequences for the pregnancy. In some cases, these patients require fetal monitoring and therefore should be transported. Syncope can be a presenting symptom of hemorrhage from ectopic pregnancy or causes of vaginal bleeding. Do not place hand/fingers into vagina of bleeding patient except in cases of prolapsed cord or breech birth that is not progressing Please note, on scene Obstetric clinicians may provide TXA. Please ensure TXA has not been previously provided before proceeding with TXA. PPage 82 Gold 20 (Back to TOC)Nausea and Vomiting E APNausea and vomiting are symptoms of some other illness. Therefore, this is a supplemental protocol to be used in addition to other relevant protocols EMT 1. Manage airway as appropriate, see Blue 3 2. Transport in position of comfort, unless contraindicated 3. If available and so trained, perform 12-lead ECG if the patient has a history of cardiac disease, risk factors for cardiac disease, or based on the EMS clinician's discretion. ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 3. Perform 12-lead ECG under the following circumstances: a. The patient has a history of cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac disease, b. Or, based on the clinician?s discretion 4. Consider Ondansetron: (Remember: do not administer if patient has history of long QT syndrome) a. Adults: administer ondansetron 4 mg ODT tablet PO, or ondansetron 4 mg IV i. May repeat once after 15 minutes as needed. b. Pediatric patients: i. If greater than 4 years old, use the adult oral and IV dose as above ii. If less than 4 years old, give 0.1 mg/kg IV/IM up to adult dose 5. Consider IV access if active vomiting or for management of underlying cause 6. Consider fluid bolus if actively vomiting 7. Contact OLMC for dosage question, abnormal vital signs, or coincident drug use (including alcohol) by patient. PEARLS for Management of Nausea and Vomiting: A small percentage of patients receiving ondansetron experience adverse cardiac reactions including QT prolongation. For this reason, patients should be questioned about preexisting QT prolongation, which is a contraindication to receiving ondansetron. In these conditions, patients SHOULD NOT receive ondansetron. There are also many medications which may cause a prolonged QT interval and ondansetron should be withheld in these cases.

Abnormal sensory or motor exam?Unreliable?** (Intox/Alt LOC/ Acute stress reaction) Distracting injury?***Manage spine Green 7Do not immobilize No NoNoNo Yes Yes YesYes * High risk mechanisms of injury in the pediatric population include, but are not limited to, the following: motor vehicle collisions, recreational vehicles (all-terrain vehicles and snowmobiles), axial loading, substantial torso injuries, and falls greater than 10 feet. ** Clearance of the spine requires the patient to be calm, cooperative, sober, and alert. Note that the smell of alcohol on the breath is not necessarily the same thing as intoxication; a single beer can be detected on the breath, but does not necessarily cause significant intoxication. The real question is not about the presence or absence of any alcohol, etc.; it is whether or not the patient and the exam are reliable. *** Distracting injury includes any injury that produces clinically apparent pain that might distract the patient from the pain of a spine injury. The real question is not about the presence or absence of any other injuries, it is whether or not the patient and the exam are reliable. Remember that patients can fracture the spine at any level, not just the C-spine. If a fracture at another level of the spine is suspected, the entire spine must be immobilized, including the cervical spine. Patients with thoracic or lumbar fractures will commonly have associated cervical spine injuries.Page 89 Green 7 (Back to TOC)Spine Management #1 Patient requires spinal management Does the patient have a helmet on? Is the patient in a seated position and able to self-extricate? * Immobilize cervical spine with collar or alternate method -THEN- Extricate with long board OR other extrication device -OR- If child is in car seat, extricate in the car seat if child is already strapped in with harnessPlace cervical collar and allow patient to self-extricateManually remove if clinically indicated (for airway management hemorrhage control, etc.) NoYes Yes Yes No Once patient is on the EMS stretcher, remove the long board UNLESS safe transport requires the use of a long board (see PEARLS). Transfer patient to appropriate hospital based on trauma triage decisions. If patient is in a car seat, see Pediatric Transportation protocol, Pink 11.* Patients are able to self-extricate from a motor vehicle or seated position to an EMS stretcher when all of the following conditions are met: 1.Able to reliably follow commands including instructions to maintain neutral spine position 2.Without injury that would preclude patient from ambulating 3.The patient ambulates as little as possible. Ultimately the EMS stretcher should be in close proximity to the patient Patients in the lying position should be moved to the EMS stretcher by scoop/long board or other similar device. Only patients in a seated position (i.e. a vehicle) are candidates for self-extrication. Proper methods of self-extrication limit patient movement as much as possible. For instance, patient movement should be limited to standing and pivoting to the stretcher. Please use caution when considering self-extrication and recognize that some vehicles are difficult to self-extricate from. Use judgment when considering self-extrication, recalling the goal of minimizing spine movement. If, in your judgment, self-extrication would lead to more spine motion than an alternate method of extrication, proceed with the alternate method. Page 90 Green 8 (Back to TOC)PEARLS for Spine Management Role of Backboards - While the MDPB is attempting to limit the use of backboards, prehospital and hospital clinicians should recognize that there remain circumstances in which use of a backboard is appropriate. Backboards should be utilized to extricate patients from vehicles or other situations when they are unable to extricate themselves (critical patients, patients with lower extremity injuries, severe head injuries, etc.). In most instances, once on the EMS stretcher, the backboard is redundant and can be removed. However, in some settings, it may be appropriate for the backboard to remain. Those settings include, but are not limited to the following: 1.Cases in which the backboard is being utilized as an element of the splinting strategy (such as multiple long bone fractures) 2.Cases in which the patient is at risk for vomiting but unable to protect their own airway (such as intoxication, head injury, etc.) and may need to be turned to the side for airway protection during transport. 3.Cases in which the patient is unresponsive or agitated (i.e. head injury) 4.Cases in which removal of the backboard would otherwise delay transport to definitive care in a critical patient Preferred Position - The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There are two circumstances under which raising the head of the bed should be considered: a. Patients in respiratory distress. Populations at risk for developing respiratory distress when laying flat include the elderly with underlying lung disease, patients with morbid obesity and late-term pregnant patients b. Patient with suspected severe head trauma Under these circumstances, consider raising the head of the bed to no more than 30 degrees Inter-Facility Transport - Long backboards do not have a role in the transport of patients between hospitals EVEN IF SPINE INJURY IS DIAGNOSED. Use of long boards during inter-facility transport is associated with increased pain and potential for pressure sores and ulcers. Patients should instead be managed with a cervical collar (if appropriate) and firmly secured to the EMS stretcher. If a sending facility has placed the patient on a long board or requests use of a long board, EMS clinicians should discuss the option of foregoing backboard use with the sending physician. If a back board is used, it must be padded adequately to maximize patient comfort. Penetrating Injury - The incidence of incomplete, unstable spine injury in penetrating trauma is low. Spine immobilization on a backboard is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with penetrating injuries to the neck, especially gun shot wounds, due to unrecognized hemorrhage and airway compromise. Spine immobilization does not appear to prevent progression of neurologic injury in cases of penetrating cervical trauma and may negatively affect patients with vascular and airway injuries. Penetrating trauma such as a gunshot wound or stab wound should not be immobilized on a long board and should instead be secured firmly to the EMS stretcher. Emphasis should be on airway and breathing management, treatment of shock, and rapid transport to a Level 1 or 2 Trauma Center. Special Patient Populations -Caution should be exercised in older patients (i.e. 65 years and older) and in very young patients (i.e. less than 3 years of age), as spinal assessment may be less sensitive in discerning spinal fractures in these populations. However, age alone should not be a factor in decision-making for prehospital spinal care, rather the patient?s ability to reliably provide a history should be considered. -In children using a booster seat or lap/shoulder belt during a motor vehicle collision, consider allowing the patient to self-extricate him/herself after applying a cervical collar, if needed. For the infant or toddler who is already strapped in a car seat with a built-in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat. -Children who do not require spinal immobilization or lying flat may be safely transported when restrained in an age-appropriate car seat. Children who do require spinal immobilization or lying flat should be directly secured to the stretcher. Helmet Use - Padding should be applied, if necessary, to maintain neutral cervical spine positioning depending on the type of sports helmet and presence or absence of shoulder pads. Management - In patients who have suffered a potential spinal injury and need to be moved onto or off of a backboard, consider using the lift and slide technique rather than the log roll technique, when feasible.Spine Management #2Page 91 Green 9 (Back to TOC)Glasgow Coma Scale Adult Child Infant Score Eye Opening Response Open spontaneously Same as Adult 4 Open to voice command Same as Adult 3 Open to painful stimuli Same as Adult 2 Eyes remain closed Same as Adult 1 Best Motor Response Moves on command Obeys commandsMoves spontaneously/ purposefully6 Pushes painful stimuli awayLocalizes painful stimuliWithdraws to touch 5 Withdraws from painful stimuliWithdraws in response to painWithdraws in response to pain4 Decorticate (flexion)Flexion in flexion pain3 Decerebrate (extension)Extension in response to painAbnormal extension in response to pain2 No motor response to pain No response No response 1 Best Verbal Response Oriented Oriented/AppropriateCoos and babbles 5 Confused Confused Irritable, cries 4 Inappropriate wordsInappropriate words Cries to pain 3 Incomprehensible soundsIncomprehensible soundsMoans to pain 2 No sounds No response No response 1 Total 3-15Page 92 Green 10 (Back to TOC)Chest Trauma EMT 1.O2, as appropriate 2.Assist ventilations (PPV), if needed 3.Request ALS, if available 4.Impaled Objects a.Secure in place with bulky dressings 5.

For presumed tension pneumothorax, perform chest decompression NOTE: Chest decompression will be performed on the involved side using a Maine EMS-approved device. Chest decompression should be preferentially performed at the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the anterior axillary line. The second or third intercostal space on the mid-clavicular line may be used, if necessary. E A P PEARLS for Chest Trauma -The fourth to fifth intercostal space on the anterior axillary line is preferred to the second or third intercostal space on the mid-clavicular line because of significant failure rates of the mid-clavicular approach (24-54% failure rate at the mid-clavicular line vs. 8-22% of the time for anterior axillary approach). This is, in part, due to a larger average depth to the thoracic cavity at the mid-clavicular line vs the anterior axillary line. -All needle decompressions are at risk of kinking/clotting or not reaching the thoracic cavity. Patients undergoing needle decompression should be monitored for change in symptoms after the procedure. If concern for needle decompression failure arises, repeat the procedure and continue monitoring. If the initial procedure site was the mid-clavicular line, consider repeating at the anterior axillary line.

Focus on the child's level of consciousness, decreased responsiveness or mental status change OR -Any multisystem trauma requiring BVM (or advanced airway/ventilation) OR -Any post-traumatic seizures Continuously monitor and re-evaluate every 3-5 minutes, including: 1. Continuous O2 saturation via pulse oximetry Systolic blood pressure 3. Continuous quantitative end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) monitoring for ALL patients requiring advanced airway management EMT 1.Consider immobilizing the spine if indicated per Green 7 2. If not in shock, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees while maintaining spinal immobilization, if necessary Management of Airway/Oxygenation 3. Place continuous high-flow O2 via non-rebreather mask on all potential TBI cases 4. Identify and treat any episode of hypoxia (O2 saturation less than 90% and/or any evidence of cyanosis). 5. If high-flow O2 fails to correct hypoxia, treat per Airway Algorithm, Blue 3 6. Continue to monitor/re-evaluate every 3-5 minutes Management of Ventilation 7. If there is evidence of hypoventilation despite high-flow O2, see Blue 3, Airway Algorithm 8. Target ventilation rates (from the National TBI Guidelines): a. PEDIATRIC age 0-2 years: 1 breath every 2-3 seconds (25 breaths per minute) b. PEDIATRIC age 3-14 years: 1 breath every 3 seconds (20 breaths per minute) c. Adolescents/Adults age 15+: 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute) E -PEARL: A single oxygen saturation less than 90% is independently associated with at least a doubling of mortality.

Refer to Gold 6 for treatment Advanced EMT/Paramedic Management of Airway/Oxygenation 10. If airway compromise of hypoxia persists after above interventions, proceed with standard step wise airway management per Blue 3. Management of Ventilation 11. If advanced airway, goal ETCO2 levels are between 35 and 45 mmHg (target = 40 mmHg) Management of Hypotension/Blood Pressure 12. In patients with any potential for TBI, immediately initiate IV access to ensure maintenance of SBP 13. PEDIATRICS - GOAL SBP defined below: a. Hypotension is defined as SBP below the 5th percentile for age, estimated using the following guide: i. Age 0-10: 70 mmHg + (age x 2) ii. Age greater than 10: 90 mmHg (same as adolescents and adults) E AP-PEARL: This TBI guideline does not encourage any hyperventilation (as was encouraged in previous protocol updates) for impending cerebral herniation for the following reasons: -There is no evidence that hyperventilation improves patient outcomes -There is evidence that even mild hyperventilation harms TBI patients, even those with severe head injury-PEARL: Hyperventilation is independently associated with at least a doubling of mortality. Some studies have shown that even moderate hyperventilation can increase the risk of dying by six times. Evidence has shown repeatedly that inadvertent hyperventilation occurs if not meticulously prevented by using adjuncts to assist deterrence, no matter the experience of the EMS clinician. Adjuncts including Pressure-Controlled Bags (PCBs), Ventilation Rate Timers (VRTs), and ETCO2 monitoring during advanced airway management should be used, if available. -Hypoventilation is defined as ineffective respiratory rate, shallow or irregular respirations, or periods of apnea. ContinuedPage 95 Green 13 (Back to TOC)Head Trauma, #3 Continued from Previous Page iii. \"Rules of Thumb\" to remember: 1. Infant = 70 mmHg 2. 5 year old = 80 mmHg 3. 10 years and older = 90 mmHg b. For SBP below goal for age, give 20 ml/kg IV bolus every 5 minutes until age-based goal SBP for age is achieved 14. ADOLESCENTS and ADULTS - Goal SBP = greater than 90 mmHg a. Initiate fluid resuscitation with an initial bolus of 1 liter for any SBP measurement less than 90 mmHg b. Continue IV fluid administration at a rate and volume sufficient to maintain SBP greater than 90 mmHg 15. For Nausea and Vomiting, refer to Gold 20. Please Note: IV Ondansetron is preferred in patients with moderate to severe head injuries or if the EMS clinician has any concerns regarding the patient's ability to tolerate orals or manage their airway independently.APPEARLS for Management of Hypotension/Blood Pressure -A single episode of SBP <90 mmHG is independently associated with at least a doubling of mortality. Repeated episodes of hypotension can increase the risk of dying by as much as eight times. Hypotension kills neurons! -In the context of Head Trauma, do not allow permissive hypotension below 90 mmHG (in adults) and do not wait for the patient to become hypotensive. If the SBP is dropping, or if there are any other signs of compensated shock such as increasing heart rate with decreasing SBP, begin aggressive treatment before the patient becomes hypotensive. -In TBI, treatment of acute hypertension is NOT recommended. -IV fluids should be restricted to a minimal ?keep open? rate in patients with, SBP ? 100 mmHg ?140 mmHg in adults.

If hemorrhage continues, consider placement of a second tourniquet, proximal to the first. Experience has shown applying two tourniquets greatly reduces the incidence of hemorrhage, especially in injuries to the lower extremity 3.If life-threatening bleeding is not controlled by the above or is located in an area not amenable to placement of a tourniquet, consider applying a Maine EMS- approved hemostatic agent by packing the agent in the wound and applying/maintaining pressure over the agent for a minimum of 5 minutes. Check for ongoing bleeding. If bleeding has stopped, bandage appropriately; if bleeding continues, reapply pressure for a minimum of 5 minutes. If bleeding continues after the second period of pressure, remove the initial hemostatic agent and repeat with a new hemostatic agent. Remember, for these agents to have maximal effectiveness, they must be packed inside the wound as close to the bleeding source as possible 4.Treat for shock, if indicated, and manage airway as appropriate 5.If amputation, rinse severed part briefly and gently with sterile saline to remove debris a.Wrap severed part in sterile gauze, moisten with sterile saline (do not soak), place in a water-tight container. Place container on ice (do not use dry ice). Do not put part directly on ice. If necessary, use ice packs to provide some level of cooling 6.Request Paramedic if bleeding cannot be controlled, patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of shock, or the patient requires pain management due to tourniquet placement ADVANCED EMT /PARAMEDIC 7.IV en route (refer to Hemorrhagic Shock protocol, Green 16). 8.Cardiac monitorHemorrhagePage 98 Green 16 (Back to TOC)If history of illness or mechanism of injury consistent with signs/symptoms of shock (elevated pulse, elevated respiratory rate, cool/pale skin, altered LOC, anxiety, sweating or lowered BP) then transport as soon and as efficiently as possible.

Control bleeding, refer to Hemorrhage protocol, Green 15 2. Manage airway, as appropriate; see Blue 3 3. If patient is in third trimester of pregnancy: a.Place patient on left lateral recumbent side and re-evaluate b.If shock is secondary to trauma, immobilize patient on a spinal board before placing in left or right lateral recumbent position (manually displace uterus to the left or right if tilting the board is not possible) 4. If the cause of hypovolemic shock is felt to be secondary to acute unstable pelvic fracture, the EMT, AEMT, or Paramedic may consider using a Maine EMS-approved pelvic stabilization device. If Maine EMS-approved pelvic binder is not available, consider immobilization with a sheet wrap. 5. Request ALS ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 6. IV en route 7. Cardiac monitor 8. If shock present (see below table), perform fluid bolus according to the following guidelines: a.Pediatrics ? establish IV access and perform 20 mL/kg fluid bolus. Repeat, as needed, within 15-30 min b.Uncontrolled bleeding: for suspected internal bleeding or uncontrolled bleeding, fluid bolus to maintain age appropriate target systolic BP (90 mmHg in adults) c.Suspected TBI/CNS injury: fluid bolus to maintain BP greater than 90 mmHg d.Current evidence suggests there may be a benefit from use of Lactated Ringers in critically ill patients with shock. Consider using Lactated Ringers preferentially, if available. 9. Contact OLMC if patient is older than 65 years of age for fluid bolus order 10. Contact OLMC if blood pressure remains less than 90 systolic after fluid bolusesHemorrhagic Shock #1 E AP ContinuedPage 99 Green 17 (Back to TOC)Hemorrhagic Shock #2 PEARLS for the use of TXA: Tranexamic acid is a lysine analogue that competitively binds to plasminogen therefore interrupting interactions with fibrin and preventing fibrinolysis or clot break down. Patients in hemorrhagic shock from either blunt or penetrating trauma may benefit from Tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA must be provided as soon as possible, preferably within 1 hour of injury and absolutely before 3 hours from injury. Please ensure that receiving hospital staff: 1. Know the time of injury, 2. Are aware that the patient received TXA, 3. Are aware of the 1 gram dose as the patient may need to be re-dosed upon arrival, and 4. Flag the IV line that the patient received TXA through with a labeled piece of tape as some medications and blood products should not be provided through the same line. *Additionally, discuss the use of TXA in patients on anticoagulants as these patients may require anticoagulation reversal and the combination of TXA and some of the reversal agents may have additive thrombotic effects. There are few adverse effects of this medication. TXA may cause hypotension if provided rapidly. The full dose should be provided over 10 minutes to prevent hypotension. Continued from Previous Page PARAMEDIC 11. In patients with either penetrating/blunt trauma OR post-partum hemorrhage AND: a. are greater than or equal to 16 years of age, and b. are hemodynamically unstable as evidenced by tachycardia, hypotension or other evidence of shock, and c. who are less than 180 minutes (3 hours) from the time of injury/hemorrhage, consider: i. Tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 gr IV mixed in 250 ml of NS over 10 minutes 1. NOTE: Discuss the use of TXA in patients on anticoagulation with OLMC before providing medication* -Isolated patients with hemorrhagic shock SHOULD receive TXA regardless of head injury), -Patients younger than 16 years old -Patients greater than 24 wks pregnant (or pregnant with fundus above umbilicus) suffering hemorrhagic shock due to trauma, -Patients with known hypercoagulable states, -The patient is more than 180 minutes (3 hours) from the time of injury, -Patients with hemorrhage due to GI bleeding P ContinuedPage 100 Green 18 (Back to TOC)Hemorrhagic Shock #3 Classification of Hemorrhagic Shock Compensated ShockMild mL)15-30% (1000-1500 mL)>40% (>140) Blood Pressure NormalOrthostatic ChangeMarked DecreaseProfound Decrease Refill Normal May be Always Delayed Respiration Normal Mild IncreaseModerate TachypneaMarked Tachypnea and Respiratory Collapse Mental or Lethargic/Obtunded Additional PEARLS for Hemorrhagic Shock: 1) TXA and GI Bleeding: Recent evidence suggests patients with gastrointestinal bleeding SHOULD NOT receive tranexamic acid. Patients with GI bleeding who received TXA had no improvement in mortality but did suffer increased morbidity, including increased venous thromboembolic events. 2) TXA and Isolated Head Injury: The role of TXA in isolated head injury remains controversial with conflicting evidence in the medical literature. The most recent evidence suggests an association between prehospital TXA and increased mortality in patients with isolated severe brain injury. In an effort to maintain the upmost patient safety and promote the best possible patient outcomes, isolated head trauma remains a contraindication for TXA in the 2021 protocols. As a reminder, multi-trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock SHOULD receive TXA regardless of head injury. Page 101 Green 19 (Back to TOC)Burn #1 E A PEMT 1.

NOTE: doses of acetaminophen less than 1000 mg require infusion via pump 11. For stable patients continuing to suffer pain from trauma or other listed inclusion criteria, consider the use of any ONE of the following medications: a. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV/IM/IN with an initial MAX dose of 100 mcg. i. For persistent traumatic pain, may repeat doses every 5-10 minutes at 0.5-1 mcg/kg (MAX dose 100 mcg) IV/IM/IN titrated to effect, with a cumulative MAX dose of 5 mcg/kg ii. NOTE: Fentanyl may be ineffective in patients with underlying opioid use disorder b. OR, Ketamine: i. Ketamine 0.2 mg/kg IV to a MAX dose of 25 mg. Mix in 100 mL bag of saline and infuse over 10 minutes via a pump. 1. Repeat in 15 minutes as needed for continued pain to a cumulative MAX dose of 1 mg/kg ii.

Isolated trauma involving the head, ii. Back pain, iii. Non-traumatic extremity pain, iv. Any patient with mental status changes, v. Any patient with unstable vital signs (including SBP < 100 mmHg) vi. Coincident drug use (including alcohol) (Continued)APage 105 Green 23 (Back to TOC)Universal Pain Management #3 PEARLS for Pain Management: 1. Consider the potential for medical causes of trauma, especially in the elderly, lift assist patient, falls, and syncope. In such cases, refer to the appropriate protocol and monitor the patient as described. 2. Acute pain management is often considered to be a ?ladder? process; that is, start at the bottom rung and increase the ?strength? AND risk of interventions in a step wise fashion similar to climbing the rungs of a ladder. Therefore, it is expected that all clinicians, regardless of license level, will manage patients in the step wise fashion to the maximum scope of practice of their licenses. 3. Pearls for acetaminophen: Patients with underlying liver disease or those who have taken acetaminophen within the last 4 hours should NOT receive acetaminophen. Acetaminophen IV comes in a glass container and requires vented IV tubing. Acetaminophen should be administered, undiluted, over 15 minutes. 4. Pearls for fentanyl: Fentanyl may be considered the first line analgesic after acetaminophen. Adverse effects include bradypnea and hypotension. 5. Pearls for ketamine: Ketamine may be preferential for patients with a history of opioid intolerance or opioid use disorder. Ketamine must be infused slowly to reduce the incidence of complications including hypotension, bradypnea, and laryngospasm. Continued from Previous Page 13. Contact OLMC if desiring to switch from one type of analgesic to another (other than from acetaminophen), no matter the duration of time that has passed since dosing the initial agent. Adding one class of medications to another can have additive effects such as hypotension, bradypnea, depression of mental status, etc. 14.

May repeat as needed with goal of QRS complex less than 120 msec. (8.4% sodium bicarbonate diluted 1:1 with D5W to 4.2% [0.5 mEq/mL] prior to administration in patients less than 2 years of age.) 2. Fluid bolus for hypotension 3. Contact OLMC to discuss additional fluid bolus versus initiating NOREPInephrine IV infusion. NOREPInephrine infusions must be administered via a Maine EMS approved medication pump. a. Preparation ? mix NOREPInephrine 8 mg in 250 mL NS [32 mcg/mL] b. Dosing - Starting dose of NOREPInephrine is 0.03 mcg/kg/min. Titrate by 0.03 mcg/kg/min every 3-5 minutes. Usual dose is 0.03-0.25 mcg/kg/min. Usual MAX dose is 0.6 mcg/kg/min. Absolute MAX dose is 3 mcg/kg/min. c.

This should be the priority for these patients and is accomplished by airway management. Naloxone may be administered, but only after initiation of airway management practices. Do not give naloxone to a patient who is in cardiac arrest. This practice is not helpful and may be harmful as it distracts from the best performance of tasks that are necessary for the successful resuscitation of cardiac arrest. Refer to the 2019 Naloxone White Paper for more information. -Naloxone should be titrated to adequate respiratory drive and airway protection rather than a completely awakened state. -Patients receiving naloxone should be transported to the hospital. Contact OLMC for patients refusing transport. For tricyclic antidepressant/sodium-channel blocker toxicity: -The most common drugs requiring boluses sodium bicarbonate are as follows: -For adults, TCAs -For pediatrics, antihistamines, though it is not common to get to the point of administering sodium bicarbonate for pediatric patients. -There are several classes of medications that can cause sodium channel blockade when taken in an overdose, causing QRS prolongation and requiring sodium bicarbonate administration. The classes of these medications (with some examples) are listed much detailed information about the drug as possible and monitor the QRS as per protocol -Sodium bicarbonate increases extracellular sodium, thereby overcoming sodium channel blockade of the tricyclic antidepressant and other sodium-channel blocking medications. This effect is transient and may be difficult to notice at first. Some patients may need repeated doses of sodium bicarbonate to fully correct QRS duration (under 120 msec). If no change to the QRS occurs, please repeat immediately. While some patients may require additional doses of sodium bicarbonate, this should not delay transport. -Consider the importance of alerting OLMC.

This protocol establishes the conditions for naloxone distribution (i.e., Naloxone \"Leave Behind\" Program). For patients refusing transportation, please refer to the Transport protocol, Grey 20. EMT/AEMT/Paramedic If a patient treated for opioid overdose refuses transport to the hospital, and: 1. The patient has decision making capacity (defined by Maine EMS Transport Protocol, Grey 20, and 2. Responding EMS clinicians are trained to distribute naloxone, and 3. Maine EMS approved naloxone distribution kits are available, then: a. Distribute one (1) Maine EMS approved naloxone kit for future use to either the patient, for the patient, their family or friends to use in the case of suspected opioid overdose. b. Perform point of care training for use of the kit as described in Maine EMS naloxone distribution training. c. In addition to the naloxone kit and point of care training, please also provide a list of local substance use disorder resources. PEARLS -Maine has disproportionately been affected by the national opioid epidemic. In an effort to address opioid overdoses, Maine EMS has worked with the legislation to create pathways for distribution of naloxone in the instance a patient is treated for opioid overdose in the pre-hospital environment AND refuses transport. -Please recognize, this protocol is specific to opiate use disorder AND the patient MUST meet the criteria for decision making capacity as described in the Maine EMS Transport Protocol, Grey 20. For patients WITHOUT decision making capacity, please follow the steps in Grey 20. -The 130th Maine Legislature passed LD 1333, \"An Act Concerning the Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program and the Dispensing of Naloxone Hydrochloride by Emergency Medical Services Providers\" which authorizes the practice of EMS clinicians leaving a medication with a non-transported patient for future use.

PEARLS -In general, patients exposed or contaminated by radiation should be triaged and treated according to the severity of their conventional injuries. -Patients contaminated with radioactive material (flecks embedded in clothing or skin), generally pose minimal exposure risk to medical personnel who use appropriate PPE. -Irradiated patients pose no threat to medical clinicians. -Time to nausea and vomiting is a reliable indicator of receiving a significant dose of ionizing radiation. The more rapid the onset of vomiting, the higher the whole-body dose of radiation. -Tissue burns are a late finding (weeks following exposure) of ionizing radiation injury. If burns are present acutely, they are from a thermal or chemical mechanism. -Seizures may suggest acute radiation syndrome if accompanied by early vomiting. If other clinical indicators do not suggest a whole-body dose of greater than 20 Gy, consider other causes of seizure.Page 122 Yellow 11 (Back to TOC)Hypothermia #1 E PABold indicates major thresholds between stages Adapted from \"State of Alaska Cold Injuries Guidelines\" 2014 Treatment SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA WITH SIGNS OF LIFE/NOT IN CARDIAC ARREST: EMT 1.Prevent further heat loss by insulating from the ground and shielding from wind and water.

A true medical emergency that requires radical field treatment, usually, but not always, associated with heat exhaustion. Heat stroke is characterized by multisystem organ injury and failure. CNS dysfunction characterized by alterations in mental status is a hallmark distinguishing between heat exhaustion and heat stroke. ASSESSMENT: If core temperature is obtained, it is 105\u00b0 F (40.6\u00b0 C) or greater. Abnormal consciousness and/or CNS function; seizures are common. Any acute change in consciousness/CNS function in the context of a significant heat challenge should be managed as heat stroke without delay. Skin condition/color and sweating are variable, depending on volume status. Note that red, dry skin is not a dependable sign of heat stroke. TREATMENT: Immediate radical cooling is the urgent priority, followed by volume replacement. EMT 1.Cool the patient immediately by any means practical, such as: a.Initiate Radical Cooling when available (especially beneficial for exertional hyperthermia, i.e. athletes, laborers): i.Immerse patient up to their neck in ice water tub, if available. ii.TACO Method (Tarp-Assisted Cooling with Oscillation), if available, with 4-5 people holding the patient in a tarp, add ice water at foot and up to the neck and continuously oscillate the tarp to avoid warming of water in contact with the patient. b.Also consider non-radical cooling which includes: ice packs applied to neck, axillae, groin, back; wet patient, apply cold wet sheets to patient, and air conditioning en route. c.Consider moistening the skin and fan vigorously. This method is effective only at low ambient humidity and a large electric fan is more beneficial than manual fanning. 2.Discontinue radical cooling if: a.Shivering begins b.Core temperature falls to or below 102\u00b0 F (38.8\u00b0 C).

EAPPage 128 Pink 2 (Back to TOC)Pediatric Respiratory Distress with Inspiratory Stridor Inspiratory stridor may be due to many causes in the pediatric population, including croup, foreign body aspiration, or epiglottitis. Stridor refers to upper airway obstruction as in laryngotracheitis/croup and is often accompanied by hoarseness and/or a barking cough (seal-like cough). As stridor worsens in severity, the following may also be observed: tachypnea, retractions, accessory muscle use, nasal flaring, fatigue from respiratory effort, and cyanosis. EMT / ADVANCED EMT 1.

Signs of moderate/severe croup include stridor at moderate intercostal retractions (including suprasternal retractions), agitation/restlessness/tired appearing, difficulty talking or feeding. 6. Contact OLMC for the second dose of nebulized EPINEPHRine if symptoms do not improve a consider alternate diagnosis such as aspiration of foreign body, bacterial tracheitis, epiglotitis. * Nebulized EPINEPHrine/racemic EPINEPHrine may be contraindicated in children with a history of congenital heart disease.EA P PEARLS A common challenge when working with the pediatric population is the administration of medication. If commercial products are unavailable, alternative measures are often undertaken, such as crushing and dissolving portions of a tablet, or extemporaneous compounding of oral products. In some cases, an extemporaneous liquid cannot be prepared easily from tablets or capsules and off-label oral use of an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) preparation is considered. An example of this is administering the injectable formulation of dexamethasone orally. This practice is followed in emergency departments around the country. Please note that at this time, the only IV medication on the MEMS formulary that has been approved to be given orally is single-dose/one-time use dexamethasone.Page 129 Pink 3 (Back to TOC)Neonatal and Young Infant Fever APEEMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC: 1.

The rate of serious bacterial infection (SBI) is up to 20% in neonates. Often, fever may be the only sign of critical illness in these children. All febrile neonates and young infants should be transported to the emergency department for further evaluation. Definitions: -Neonates are children 0-28 days old -Young infants are less than 90 days old. -Fever is a temperature of greater than or equal to 38.0 \u00b0C or 100.4 \u00b0F measured by any method by either caregivers or EMS. -Serious Bacterial Infections (SBI) in neonates and young infants may also present with hypothermia (temperature less than 35.0\u00b0C or 95.0 \u00b0F)Page 130 Pink 4 (Back to TOC)Childbirth, #1 EAPEMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 1. Evaluate for crowning/imminent delivery 2. If crowning/imminent delivery, encourage mother to relax, breathe slowly, and let baby deliver 2. If hypotensive, roll patient onto left or right hip 3. If the presenting part is the cord, apply pressure to the baby with a sterile, gloved hand to keep pressure off the cord until cord pulsations are felt. Raise mother?s hips onto pillows. Keep cord warm and moist. Do not clamp or cut cord 4. Request ALS, if available, and DO NOT DELAY TRANSPORT 5. If baby?s head is delivering: a. Do not hurry or slow the birth b. Check to see if cord is wrapped around neck. If so, attempt to slip the cord over the baby?s head, then repeat in case of double nuchal cord. Do not clamp and cut the cord unless it appears to obstruct the birth c. Immediately place baby skin-to-skin with the mother, unless resuscitation is required. Dry and stimulate the baby, examine and keep warm, next to mother?s skin, covering mother and baby with warm blankets or aluminum foil blankets (i.e. \"space blankets\"). As soon as possible, enable child to nurse at mother?s breast. In a stable newborn, remain on scene, as conditions permit for a minimum of 15 minutes to allow for skin-to-skin contact. d. Assess APGAR SCORE at 1 and 5 minutes, refer to APGAR Score, Pink 6 e. Do not externally massage the uterus en route until placenta has delivered f. Do not forcibly remove placenta g. The cord may be left intact, or it may be double clamped and cut only when: 1. the baby is breathing and all cord pulsations have stopped (usually within 3 to 5 minutes), or 2. the baby must be moved to allow for advanced newborn resuscitation, or 3. Once the placenta has delivered. h. If placenta is delivered, wrap and package with cord intact 6. If delivery has occurred prior to EMS arrival, start at #5b above. 7. During transport, the baby should be placed in an appropriate child passenger restraint system with the head supported. Maintain warmth during transport. Wrap the baby in warm blankets or aluminum foil blankets (i.e. \"space blankets\") and a warming hat to minimize heat loss. Consider using a Maine EMS approved infant warming pad during transport. 8. Monitor the baby's airway during transport. Hypothermia in the newborn may cause decreased LOC, hypoglycemia, bradycardia and hypotension. ContinuedPage 131 Pink 5 (Back to TOC)Childbirth, #2 EAP9. Most deliveries proceed without complications ? If complications of delivery occur, the following steps are recommended: a. Shoulder dystocia ? if delivery fails to progress after head delivers, quickly attempt the following: i. Hyperflex mother?s hips to severe supine knee-chest position ii. Apply firm suprapubic pressure to attempt to dislodge shoulder iii. Apply high-flow oxygen to mother iv. Transport as soon as possible v. Contact closest appropriate receiving facility b. Prolapsed umbilical cord i. Placed gloved hand into vagina and gently lift head/body off of cord 1. Assess for pulsations in cord 2. Maintain until relieved by hospital staff. ii. Consider placing mother in prone knee-chest position or extreme Trendelenburg iii. Apply high-flow oxygen to mother iv. Transport as soon as possible v. Contact closest appropriate receiving facility c. Breech birth i. Place mother supine, allow the buttocks and trunk to deliver spontaneously, then support the body while the head is delivered ii. If head fails to deliver, place gloved hand into vagina with fingers between infant?s face and uterine wall to create an open airway iii. Apply high-flow oxygen to mother iv. The presentation of an arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate transport to hospital v. Assess for presence of prolapsed cord and treat as above vi. Transport as soon as possible vii. Contact closest appropriate receiving facility d. Excessive bleeding during active labor may occur with placenta previa i. Obtain history from patient ii. Placenta previa may prevent delivery of infant vaginally iii. C-Section needed ? transport urgently iv. Contact closest appropriate receiving facility e. Maternal cardiac arrest i. Apply manual pressure to displace uterus from right to left ii. Treat per Red 8, Cardiac Arrest - defibrillation and medications should be given for same indications and doses as if non-pregnant patient iii. Contact OLMC to discuss rapid transport if infant is estimated to be over 24 weeks gestation 1. Perimortem Cesarean section at receiving facility is most successful if done within 5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest 10. If any of the above conditions are present, the patient is best cared for at a hospital with Obstetric (OB) services. If the patient condition permits, transport to the nearest hospital with OB capabilities if total transport time is less than 45 minutes, otherwise go to the closest ED.

Page 137 Pink 11 (Back to TOC)Pediatric Transportation, #1 PEARLS These guidelines apply to transporting pediatric patients who are of an age/weight that require a child safety seat. Pediatric patients that don't require a child safety seat should be transported following adult guidelines. APEMaine Statute 29-A M.R.S.\u00a72081(2) & (3) requires all children weighing less than 80 pounds, less than 57 inches in height and less than 8 years old to be properly restrained in a child safety seat when riding in a vehicle. Children between 40 and 80 pounds AND less than 8 years of age must be properly secured in a child restraint system in accordance with the child restraint system manufacturer's recommendations. An ill or injured child must be restrained in a manner that minimizes injury in an ambulance crash. The best location for transporting a pediatric patient is secured directly to the ambulance cot. Never allow anyone to hold an infant or child during transport. TYPES OF RESTRAINTS: 1. Convertible (traditional) car seat with two belt paths (front and back) with four points for belt attachment to the cot is considered best practice for pediatric patients who can tolerate a semi-upright position. a. Position safety seat on cot facing foot-end with backrest elevated to meet back of child safety seat. b. Secure safety seat with 2 pairs of belts at both forward and rear points of seat. c. Place shoulder straps of the harness through slots just below child?s shoulders and fasten snugly to child. d. Follow manufacturer?s guidelines regarding child?s weight. Note: Non-convertible safety seats cannot be secured safely to cot. If child?s personal safety seat is not a convertible seat, it cannot be used on the cot. 2. Stretcher harness device with 5-point harness (examples: Ferno Pedi-Mate, SafeGuard Transport, ACR) a. Attach securely to cot utilizing upper back strap behind cot and lower straps around cot?s frame. b. 5-point harness must rest snugly against child. Secure belt at child?s shoulder level so no gaps exists above shoulders. c. Adjust head portion of cot according to manufacturer?s recommendation. d. Follow manufacturer guidelines for weight ratings. 3. Car bed with both a front and rear belt path (example: Dream Ride Infant Car Bed) a. For infants who cannot tolerate a semi-upright position or who must lie flat. b. Position car bed so infant lies perpendicular to cot, keeping infant?s head toward center of patient compartment. c. Fully raise backrest and anchor car bed to cot with 2 belts, utilizing the 4 attachment sites supplied with car bed. d. Only appropriate for infants from 5 ? 20 lbs. Examples Weight Range Ferno Pedi-Mate (Back to TOC)Pediatric Transportation, #2 4. Isolette/Incubator must be secured to ambulance according to manufacturer?s guidelines. a. Secure infant using manufacturer?s restraint. (Five-point harness restraint is preferred.) b. Blankets or towels may be used for additional stabilization NON-PATIENT TRANSPORT Best practice is to transport well children in a vehicle other than the ambulance, whenever possible, for safety. If no other vehicle is available and circumstances dictate that the ambulance must transport a well child, he/she may be transported in the following locations: 1. Captain?s chair in patient compartment using a size appropriate integrated seat or a convertible safety seat. 2. Passenger seat of the driver?s compartment if child is large enough (according to manufacturer?s guidelines) to ride forward-facing in a child safety seat or booster seat. Airbag should be turned off. If the air bag can be deactivated, an infant, restrained in a rear-facing infant seat, may be placed in the passenger seat of the driver?s compartment. USE OF PATIENT?S CHILD SAFETY SEAT AFTER INVOLVEMENT IN MOTOR VEHICLE CRASH The patient?s safety seat may be used to transport child to the hospital after involvement in a minor crash if ALL of the following apply: 1. It is a convertible seat with both front and rear belt paths. 2. Visual inspection, including under movable seat padding, does not reveal cracks or deformation. 3. Vehicle in which safety seat was installed was capable of being driven from the scene of the crash. 4. Vehicle door nearest the child safety seat was undamaged. 5. The air bags (if any) did not deploy. MOTHER AND NEWBORN TRANSPORT 1. Secure and transport mother on the cot. 2. Consider transporting mother and newborn in separate ambulances to properly secure each patient to a cot. 3. Transport newborn secured to the rear-facing clinician seat /captain?s chair using a size-appropriate child restraint system. Either a convertible safety seat with a forward-facing belt path or an integrated child restraint system certified by the manufacturer to meet FMVSS No. 213 may be used to secure infant. 4. Do NOT use a rear-facing only safety seat in the rear-facing clinician seat / captain?s chair as this is dangerous and may lead to significant injuries.APEPage 139 Orange 1 (Back to TOC)Maine EMS personnel are generally called to transport a mentally ill patient in one of two situations: Emergency Transport Safety for the patient and the crew is the primary concern in the transport of the mentally ill patient. Personnel should make sure they do a thorough evaluation of the patient to find and treat possible medical causes of the behavior. Refer to the Agitation/Excited Delirium protocol, Orange 4. All diagnostic and therapeutic interventions administered by EMS clinicians are pursuant to the prescriptive authority of a physician. In certain limited situations, when a patient poses a significant danger to self or others, it may be appropriate to restrain the patient involuntarily. Clinicians are cautioned to use physical restraint as a last resort, preferably with the assistance of local law enforcement, refer to Orange 3. Once the decision is made to restrain a patient, the least restrictive restraint reasonable should be implemented and the patient should remain restrained until arrival at the emergency department, unless it interferes with the delivery of medical care. Only commercially available soft restraints are approved by Maine EMS. Non-Emergency Transfer Mentally ill patients who are being transferred usually fall into one of these categories: Voluntary Committal ? These patients have agreed to be transferred to a facility for evaluation and treatment of an underlying mental illness. It is important to get a thorough report on the patient prior to transport to avoid surprises en route. Voluntary committal patients can change their mind during transport. In this case, it is the responsibility of the EMS personnel to discharge the patient at a safe location, preferably at the originating facility. If it is not possible to return the patient to the originating facility, notify local law enforcement to meet you at your location. Involuntary Committal ? Patients who are being committed involuntarily must have committal papers (blue papers) completed prior to transport. Between the hours of 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. a judge has to sign the committal papers. After 11 p.m. and before 7 a.m. the papers do not have to be signed except for Riverview Psychiatric Center (formerly AMHI) ? this is known as the ?pajama clause?. Make sure that the transporting service is listed correctly on the papers. According to Maine law, the patient must be transported in the least restrictive form of transportation available. Make sure you get a thorough history to determine whether restraints will be necessary. If the receiving facility refuses to accept the patient after evaluating them, the transporting service is required, by law, to transport the patient back to the originating facility.Transport of Mentally Ill PatientsPage 140 Orange 2 (Back to TOC)EAPDepression/Suicidal Ideation 1. Ensure the scene is safe and request law enforcement for patients actively threatening/attempting suicide 2. Assess the patient for need of medical treatment and follow appropriate protocol 3. Establish rapport with the patient by listening carefully and speaking in a non-confrontational manner. 4. Assess the patient a. Has a suicide attempt been made? If yes, request ALS b. SAD PERSONS Scale (report score to receiving hospital) 1 point for each of the following Sex: male Age <20 or >44 Depression Previous suicide attempt Ethanol abuse Rational thinking loss Social supports lacking Organized suicide plan No spouse (divorced, widowed, single) Sickness (chronic, debilitating, or severe) c. Columbia Suicide Screening (if possible, discuss the following questions with the patient): i. Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up? ii. Have you been thinking about how you might kill yourself? iii. Have you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such as collecting pills, getting a gun, giving valuables away or writing a suicide note)? 5.Provide constant, 1:1 supervision for the patient 6.Collect items such as toxic substances, alcohol, drugs and medications that may have been taken and transport with patient to the hospital 7.Provide support for family and friends who are present. 8.Obtain information from family and friends and obtain their contact information should the hospital have any questions. 9.Transport the patient to the closest facility that can meet their medical and psychiatric needs Refer to Orange 1 for Transport of Mentally Ill Patients protocol Refer to Orange 3 for Restraint protocol Refer to Orange 4 for Agitation/Excited Delirium protocol PEARL A SAD PERSONS Score > 4 or a \"yes\" answer to any of the Columbia Suicide Screening questions may indicate that the patient requires psychiatric hospitalization. However, all patients presenting with a psychiatric emergency should be transported to the hospital for evaluation.Page 141 Orange 3 (Back to TOC)Restraints In certain limited situations, when a patient poses a significant danger to self or others, it may be appropriate to restrain the patient involuntarily. Clinicians are cautioned to use physical restraint as a last resort, preferably with the assistance of local law enforcement. Once the decision is made to restrain a patient, the least restrictive restraint reasonable should be implemented and the patient should remain restrained until arrival at the emergency department, unless it interferes with the delivery of medical care. Only commercially available soft restraints are approved by Maine EMS. EMT/AEMT 1. Refer to Altered Level of Consciousness Protocol, Gold 5, to establish etiology of agitation. 2. Request law enforcement assistance 3. Request ALS 4. Attempt de-escalation techniques (speak in an honest, non-confrontational tone while avoiding eye contact). 5. Have appropriate personnel available prior to initiating restraints 6. Restrain patients in a lateral or supine position. NEVER leave patients restrained in a prone position. NEVER restrain a patient?s hands and feet behind them (hog-tying). All applied restraints must be easy to remove should a medical emergency occur. 7. Never place objects on top of patients to restrain them. 8. Restrained patients require 1:1 observation by EMS personnel and require continuous cardiac, pulse oximetry and waveform capnography monitoring, if able to do so. 9. Contact OLMC as soon as logistically possible after securing the safety of the patient and clinicians. 10. Documentation: Document de-escalation techniques utilized prior to physical restraint. Document type of restraints used, how restraints applied, when restraints applied, why restraints applied (patient's behavior and mental status), the agency and individual that applied the restraints, frequent vital signs and CSM checks, education provided to patient and time OLMC notified. 11. Restraint devices applied by law enforcement require an officer?s continued presence to ensure patient safety and allow for quick removal, if necessary. Law enforcement should accompany the patient in the ambulance. 12. Restrained patients should not be moved in a stair chair device as violent patients cannot properly be restrained in a stair chair and EMS personnel may be easily thrown off-balance by a resisting patient. 13. Restrained patients should be transported to the nearest emergency department that can safely accept the patient. PARAMEDIC 14. Refer to Agitation/Excited Delirium protocol, Orange 4. Physical restraint is both physically and mentally traumatizing to patients. Consider pharmacologic management, if required, once the patient is physically restrained. EA P Pearls for Restraints In conjunction with and support of a joint statement released in October 2020 by the NAEMSP, NASEMSO, NEMSMA, NAEMT and APA, the MDPB strongly supports regular, continuing education focused on the management of behavioral emergencies, implementation of QA/QI processes dedicated to these situations, and fostering local relationships with key stakeholders that encourage local systems of care to support EMS clinicians caring for patients suffering from behavioral emergencies.Page 142 Orange 4 (Back to TOC)Agitation/Excited Delirium #1 EMT/ADVANCED EMT 1.Maintain crew safety; ask for law enforcement assistance, if available 2.Attempt verbal de-escalation using direct, empathetic and calm voice. Present clear limits and options. Respect the patient's personal space.

Ketamine may not be used in patients greater than 65 years old 8.Monitor and document the following every 5 minutes - ECG, O2 sat, ETCO2, AMSS, and vital signs 9. Contact OLMC for dosing questions or if patient requires repeat dosing. PPearls for Agitation/Excited Delirium Agitation - is defined by excessive, purposeless cognitive and motor activity or restlessness, usually associated with a state of tension or anxiety Excited Delirium - is a sub-category of agitation, with a potential for higher mortality and morbidity. It can be defined by a patient presenting with the following constellation of symptoms (based on the 2009 ACEP White Paper) with frequency in for environmental temperature (70%) -Violent and paranoid behavior -Rapid development of symptoms -Rapidly and fluctuating periods of calm and then delirium These symptoms may be caused by a number of intoxicants, including, but not limited to alcohol, etc). Early contact of OLMC is essential for proper preparation of the receiving facility and staff. Page 144 Orange 6 (Back to TOC)Agitation/Excited Delirium #3 Pearls -Patient who are in a post-ictal state (i.e. have just suffered a seizure) are NOT considered to be in excited delirium and should NOT receive Ketamine -Patients should NOT receive BOTH Midazolam and Ketamine due to concerns for potential additive affects and respiratory depression Pearls for Midazolam/Ketamine * Midazolam -Patients with underlying medical conditions (including COPD/CHF/CAD) as well as patients older than 60 are more likely to suffer adverse effects from midazolam. Consider lower doses in this population. -WARNING: May cause respiratory depression, arrest, or apnea. -Assess patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. -Administration: IM - Administer undiluted deep IM into large muscle. -Administration: IV - Do not administer intra-arterially. Administer by slow IV injection over at least 2 minutes using a concentration of 1 mg/mL or a dilution of the 1 or 5 mg/mL concentrations. -Concomitant use with opioids: [US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. **Ketamine -Document the patient's Altered Mental Status Score (AMSS) in the run report. -Patients with an AMSS less than 4 may be more likely to require airway management when receiving Ketamine, therefore Ketamine is to be used ONLY if the patient is suffering from excited delirium, as measured by an AMSS score of 4. -Maine EMS Services will be stocking the 100 mg/mL concentration to accommodate the wide dose ranges in the protocol. This is to avoid carrying two very different concentrations and the risk of a serious dose error. -WARNING: Overdose may lead to panic attacks and aggressive behavior; rarely seizures, increased ICP, and cardiac arrest. Very similar in chemical makeup to PCP (phencyclidine), but it is shorter acting and less toxic. -Administration: IM - Inject deep IM into large muscle mass. -Administration: IV - According to the manufacturer, administer bolus/induction doses over 1 minute or at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/minute; more rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced pressor response. Some experts suggest administration over 2 to 3 minutes (Miller 2010). -The 100 mg/mL concentration should not be administered IV unless properly diluted with, at minimum, an equal volume of Sterile Water for Injection, NS, or D5W. Page 145 Orange 7 (Back to TOC)Care of the Person Experiencing Homelessness EMT/ADVANCED EMT/PARAMEDIC 1. Approach patient in a non-threatening manner and establish rapport. 2. Patient may be wearing several layers of clothes. Avoid cutting clothes, if possible, as these may be the only clothes the patient has, however do not allow clothes to prevent a full examination of the patient. Be aware of the presence of sharp objects (i.e. syringes, knives, weapons, etc.) in pockets and clothing. 3. Be cognizant of patient possessions and attempt to secure patient belongings with a trusted individual if it is not feasible to transport all belongings. 4.Homeless patients are at risk of exposure to environmental elements. Move the patient to a ?safe? environment (i.e. ambulance) early in the encounter, if feasible. a. Once the patient is physically in a private and safe location, consider inquiring about the patient's safety from physical or verbal threats. 5. Be aware of concurrent illnesses that may influence the chief complaint. Homeless individuals may lack access to routine medical care predisposing them to the risk for both chronic and acute illnesses. a. For example, the pregnancy rate of homeless women is estimated to be twice that of the general population 6. Mental illness and substance abuse occur frequently in the homeless population. Avoid attributing the current chief complaint to these underlying conditions. 7. Head injuries are common in the homeless population. For patient with altered mental status, refer to Altered Level of Consciousness Protocol, Gold 5 or Head Injury, Green 11 8. Individuals suffering homelessness may have many barriers that limit their interest in transport to a hospital. Should the patient refuse transport, refer to the Transport Protocol, Grey 20 and consider discussing with OLMCEPAPage 146 Grey 1 (Back to TOC)Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #1 I. When to Start Resuscitation: As soon as the absence of pulse and respiration is established. II. When Not to Start Resuscitation: A. All Patients: 1. When irreversible signs of death, such as rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, decomposition, incineration, other obvious lethal injuries are present. 2. When down time has been unknown or greater than 20 minutes with no bystander CPR performed and the patient is cool to touch (not from exposure), no audible heart sounds, and fixed/dilated pupils. 3. Core temperature less than 50 degrees F, chest wall so stiff that compressions cannot be performed, or patients submerged in cold water (for specific recommendations in drowning, refer to Drowning/Submersion Injuries protocol, Yellow 15). B. All Normothermic Patients: Major trauma victims who have no respiration and no pulse, no signs of life at the time of Maine EMS-licensed crew member arrival. C. When a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order is presented in one of three forms: 1. EMS DNR orders from other states' EMS/DNR programs. If the order or device (i.e. plastic bracelet, jewelry, or card) appears to be in effect, and is understandable to the crew, follow the order?s specific instructions. Devices, such as jewelry, must have the patient's name clearly displayed and must indicate the patient's wishes to be DNR. If there are no specific instructions beyond ?DNR?, follow Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR Guidelines, Grey 2. 2. Non-EMS actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST, etc.). A written order executed by a patient?s personal physician/PA/NP should be honored if it is understandable to the crew . Follow the order as written. If it is nonspecific as to the care to provide or withhold, follow the MEMS Comfort Care/DNR guidelines, Grey 2. 3. Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR Program - A Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR order does not have an expiration date. Once activated, it remains in effect until the patient, or someone acting on their behalf as described and authorized on the Comfort Care/DNR form, cancels it. (Note: Although no longer distributed by Maine EMS, extant DNR/Comfort Care ?orange? forms, wallet cards and plastic bracelets remain valid). D. When a signed Maine EMS DNR Directive form or Maine EMS-approved DNR Directive jewelry is presented to EMS personnel - Once executed by the patient and signed by a physician/PA/NP, the DNR Directive remains in effect until the expiration date on the form or, if no expiration date is noted on the form, until the patient cancels it. E. A photocopy is acceptable as proof of the existence of valid DNR Order or DNR Directive, provided that the photocopy is legible and understandable to EMS personnel. (continued)Page 147 Grey 2 (Back to TOC)Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #2 III. Treatment/Comfort Care A. When treating a patient with a Maine EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or DNR Directive, the responding EMS clinician should perform routine patient assessment and resuscitation or intervention until EMS personnel verify: 1. That an EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or DNR Directive exists; or, 2. That a Maine EMS-approved EMS Comfort Care/DNR wallet card, plastic bracelet or Maine EMS-approved DNR jewelry is present, intact and not defaced. The plastic bracelet may be worn on the wrist or ankle or on a necklace; or, 3. That Maine EMS-approved DNR Directive jewelry is present, intact and not defaced; and, 4. The identity of the patient through family or friends present, or with photo ID such as a driver?s license. A good faith effort only is required. B. Follow these EMS Comfort Care/DNR procedures in all cases: 1. These comforting interventions are encouraged: a. Open the airway manually (No intubation, no BVM unless invited by conscious patient); b. Suction and provide oxygen; c. Make the patient comfortable (position, etc.); d. Control bleeding; e. Provide pain and other medications of comfort only to a conscious patient (ALS per OLMC/Hospice Provider); f. Be supportive of the patient and family; g. Contact patient?s physician/PA/NP/Hospice Provider or OLMC if questions arise 2. Resuscitative measures to be avoided: (to be withheld, or withdrawn if resuscitation has begun prior to confirmation of EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or DNR Directive status). a. CPR; b. Intubation (ET Tube, or other advanced airway management); c. Surgical procedures; c. Defibrillation; d. Cardiac resuscitation medications; e. Artificial ventilation by any means; f. Related procedures per OLMC. (continued)(Continued from previous page)Page 148 Grey 3 (Back to TOC)Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #3 IV. Revocation, Documentation & When to Stop Resuscitation A. Who may revoke an EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order or Maine DNR Directive: 1. The patient (by destroying EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order Form, wallet card, plastic bracelet and DNR jewelry, or by destroying the DNR Directive and DNR jewelry, or verbally withdrawing the order or directive); 2. For the EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order form only: a. The patient?s physician/PA/NP who signed the order; b. The Authorized Decision-Maker for the patient who signed the order. B. Documentation: 1. Use the Maine EMS patient/run report. 2. Describe assessment of patient?s status. 3. Document which identification (i.e. form, wallet card, plastic bracelet or DNR jewelry) was used to confirm EMS Comfort Care/DNR or DNR Directive status and indicate that it was intact and not canceled. 4. Indicate the patient?s physician/PA/NP name, on the patient/run report. 5. If the patient has expired on arrival, comfort the family and follow your EMS agency?s procedure for death at home. A Maine EMS patient/run report still needs to be completed. 6. If transporting the patient, EMS clinicians should keep the original EMS Comfort Care/DNR Order Form, wallet card, plastic bracelet, DNR Directive form or DNR jewelry with the patient. C. When to Stop Resuscitation: Resuscitation should be terminated: 1. Unwitnessed Arrest: a. When the patient regains pulse/respiration. b. When criteria as defined in the Termination of Resuscitation protocol (Red 14) have been met. c. When the rescuers are physically exhausted or when equally or more highly trained health care personnel take over. d. When it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST etc.) form. e. Continue resuscitation if conditions on scene are NOT amenable to cessation of resuscitation. f. Continuation of resuscitation beyond these protocols must be in consultation with OLMC. (continued)(Continued from previous page)Page 149 Grey 4 (Back to TOC)Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #4 2. Witnessed arrest: a. When the patient regains pulse/respiration. b. When criteria as defined in the Termination of Resuscitation protocol (Red 14) have been met. c. In the absence of ALS, when the same Maine EMS-licensed crew member has determined the absence of all vital signs for 20 minutes, in spite of BLS, except in the case of hypothermia (Yellow 11). d. When the rescuers are physically exhausted or when equally or more highly trained health care personnel take over. e. When it is found that the patient has a DNR or other actionable medical order (i.e. POLST/MOLST form, etc.). f. Continue resuscitation if conditions on scene are NOT amenable to cessation of resuscitation. g. Continuation of resuscitation beyond these protocols must be in consultation with OLMC. D. Management of Patient Remains If resuscitation efforts are discontinued, follow your service?s policy for disposition of patient remains. In cases of uncertainty, arrangements should be made with OLMC with regards to disposition of the patient's body. Contact your local ED with regard to tissue donation options and procedures in advance. Refer to Death Situations for Emergency Responders protocol, Grey 9.(Continued from previous page) (continued)Page 150 Grey 5 (Back to TOC)Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Guidelines #5 Pearls for DNR Guidelines: Neither a Living will nor a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (DPOAH) form is a valid DNR order. Neither a patient?s spouse nor a healthcare agent under a DPOAH may direct EMS clinicians to withhold resuscitation in the absence of a valid DNR Order. When a written DNR order is not available but the patient has a DPOAH and the patient?s healthcare agent requests that resuscitation be withheld, contact OLMC for guidance. Living Will: A Living Will is intended to address patients who have been admitted to a healthcare facility. Living Wills rarely, if ever, have application in the prehospital environment. POLST (Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment): POLST The POLST constitutes a DNR if ?No CPR? is indicated in this section.Otherwise, if the patient has indicated they do not want resuscitation but does not have a separate valid DNR order, contact Medical Control for guidance. POLST Section B When confronted with a seriously ill patient who has a POLST form (green form) and is not in cardiac arrest : -If ?Full Treatment? box is checked: Use all appropriate stabilize/resuscitate patient. -If ?Selective Treatments? box is checked: The maximum respiratory interventions include interventions such as non-rebreather mask, CPAP, and suctioning. All appropriate IV medications may be utilized. Avoid intensive care: ventilator, cardioversion, defibrillation. Transfer to hospital if needs cannot be met in current location. -If ?Comfort-Focused Treatments? box is checked: Limit respiratory interventions to non-rebreather mask, suctioning and treatment of airway obstruction, as needed. Medications to relieve pain or discomfort may be utilized. Transfer to hospital only if comfort cannot be achieved in current setting. POLST Section C Refers to IV therapy for hydration, nutrition, and other orders. Advanced EMTs and Paramedics may start an IV for the purpose of medication administration outlined in Section B.(Continued from previous page)Page 151 Grey 6 (Back to TOC)Pre-Hospital Management of Hospice Patients, #1 EMS may be called to respond to patients on Hospice Care. This may occur because the patient (or family) was unable to reach a Hospice nurse/physician or the patient (or family) became anxious. In these circumstances, EMS clinicians should make every effort to reach a Hospice Provider and should remain with the patient until the Hospice Provider arrives. Comforting interventions (Grey 2) should be undertaken. Support family members. EMS clinicians should avoid the following interventions: -Sirens, lights or aggressive interventions. -IV therapy (except where other forms of medication administration are not possible). Discuss options with patient, family, caregivers. -Cardiac resuscitation: -Hospice patients should not be transported to the hospital except where transport is specifically requested by the patient or his/her healthcare agent or surrogate, and preferably only after consultation with the hospice team and exhaustion of other treatment pathways that do not require transport to the hospital. If the reason for calling 9-1-1 is unrelated to the Hospice patient?s terminal illness, the appropriate protocol should be followed and the patient should be transported to the hospital, if needed and requested by the patient or surrogate (example: laceration requiring sutures). OLMC should be consulted, as needed, to discuss Hospice Provider orders and other concerns. -Many hospice patients will have a hospice comfort kit that contains medications that patient?s caregivers are instructed to use to treat commonly encountered medical issues. (continued)Page 152 Grey 7 (Back to TOC)EMT Routine Patient Care. 1) Contact the hospice team (preferred) or OLMC to coordinate care and determine administration of hospice kit medications. 2) Consider paramedic response for medication administration. 3) Breakthrough Pain: Suggest administration of breakthrough pain medication by patient / families. For pain of sudden onset, seek to determine and treat the underlying cause (e.g., pathological fracture). 4) Anxiety: Consider potential causes for patient?s anxiety, such as increased pain and shortness of breath. Suggest administration of medication by patients/families. 5) Dyspnea: Administer oxygen, as appropriate, to relieve shortness of breath and achieve a respiration rate of < 20. Use a fan to blow air directly at the patient?s face. 6) Constipation: Suggest administration of constipation medication by patient/family. 7) Terminal Dehydration: Moisten lips with petroleum jelly; use artificial saliva/mouth sponges and ice chips. 8) Confusion/Delirium: Speak slowly and calmly to the person. Remind the patient of where they are, and who you are. Avoid contradictingthe patient?s statements. Ensure a patient?s hearing aid and glasses are available. Limit activity/noise in the room. Advanced EMT 9) Nausea/Vomiting: Suggest administration of nausea medication or refer to Nausea/Vomiting protocol, Gold 20. Paramedic 10) Consider following written orders for medications in hospice kit. As an adjunct, consider: a) For Breakthrough Pain, refer to Universal Pain Management Protocol, Green 21. b) For Anxiety, contact OLMC for Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IN for a max dose of 25 mg. c) For Bronchospasm, refer to Respiratory Distress with Bronchospasm protocol, Blue 7. E A PPre-Hospital Management of Hospice Patients, #2 (Continued from previous page) (continued)Page 153 Grey 8 (Back to TOC)PEARLS Breakthrough Pain assessment and management is important in patients with advanced disease as they may have a high burden of pain, be opiate tolerant, and already be receiving high doses of opioids. Anxiety ranges from mild to severe, is common in patients nearing death, and should be treated promptly. Terminal secretions are noisy, gurgling respirations caused by secretions accumulating in the lungs or oropharynx. Terminal dyspnea is exhibited by patients that are expected to die within hours to days. Individuals experiencing dyspnea often experience heightened anxiety. Constipation is a frequent cause of nausea and vomiting. Opioid-related constipation is dose-related, and patients do not develop tolerance to this side effect. Nausea / Vomiting can be extremely debilitating symptoms at the end of life. Effective control of nausea can be achieved in most patients. Fever and Infection treatment should be guided by an understanding of where the patient is in the dying trajectory and the patient's specific goals of care. Overwhelming sepsis may be a sign of active death not to be reversed. Delirium is common at end of life and is often caused by a combination of medications, dehydration, infections or hypoxia. It is distressing to families. It often heralds the end of life and may require active sedation.Pre-Hospital Management of Hospice Patients, #3 (Continued from previous page)Page 154 Grey 9 (Back to TOC)Death Situations for Emergency Responders #1 PREPARED JOINTLY BY: Attorney General, Office of Chief Medical Examiner, and Maine State Police. GENERAL AIM: Preservation of scene, including body as found, for investigative purposes within practical limits consistent with the role and responsibilities of emergency medical care givers. Death Situation Guidelines I. Preserve life: While forensic guidelines emphasize that the scene should not be disturbed, the first and most important course of action is to follow all usual procedures to ensure the preservation of life. II. Once Death is confirmed: If the decedent is clearly dead, the body should not be moved or disturbed unless there is a danger that the body may be lost or further damaged. A. Maine statutes do not require a pronouncement of death. B. The scene should be secured and left undisturbed. 1. If the police are present, they should take charge in order to determine whether the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) or whether the death certificate may be certified by the patient's private attending physician. 2. If there is no police officer present, EMS should call the local police or call the OCME directly to report the case so that a determination may be made as to the need for further investigation into the cause and manner of death. OCME emergency line to report deaths: 1-800-870-8744. 3. If it is determined not to be a Medical Examiner case, try to accommodate the family?s request or contact OLMC for guidance. 4. Consider contacting the New England Donor Services 1-800-446-6362. C. Tubes and medical devices should be left in place. Certain reusable equipment may be removed to resupply the ambulance; however, written documentation of any such action must be given to investigators. D. Any clothing or property should be left undisturbed. III. What is a Medical Examiner (ME) case?: A. Any suspected HOMICIDE. B. Any suspected SUICIDE. C. Any death involving any ACCIDENT or INJURY. D. Any death of a CHILD. E. Any death in CUSTODY. F. Deaths caused by SUSPECTED GROSS NEGLIGENCE during a Medical Procedure. G. SUDDEN DEATH from an UNKNOWN cause or any death where there is no private attending physician. H. UNIDENTIFIED persons. I. OCCUPATIONAL deaths (work-related). J. Unnatural deaths in a Mental, or DHS-Residential Care Facility. K. Any death that might ENDANGER or THREATEN the public health. (continued)Page 155 Grey 10 (Back to TOC)Death Situations for Emergency Responders #2 IV. Deaths in Children: A. All deaths in children under the age of three automatically become Medical Examiner cases unless the death is expected based on previously diagnosed natural disease. B. Determination of the cause of death in infants and children is very difficult. While the OCME understands the concerns of the parents/guardians, the child must be left undisturbed until investigating police officers have finished the initial investigation. SIDS is not an acceptable reason to transport a deceased infant or allow the infant to be moved prior to investigation. V. Reports and follow-up on Medical Examiner cases: A. If families have questions, they may be referred to the OCME. Families should call the office using the 24 hour business line at 207-624-7180. B. Copies of EMS run sheets should be given to police investigators and/or the OCME (refer to Brown 2). C. If any EMS clinician wishes follow-up information on any specific case, or if there is a question of infectious exposures, call the OCME on the business line, 207-624-7180.(Continued from previous page)Maine Death with Dignity Law r PEARLS Death with Dignity Law (Sec. 1. 22 MRSA c. 418 ): The Maine Death with Dignity Act provides eligible Maine residents with terminal, incurable diseases that will, within reasonable medical judgment, result in death within six months, the option to be prescribed a dose of medication that, if taken, will hasten the end of their life. Patients should have a either a form that identifies their participation in the Maine Death with Dignity Program or a DNR/POLST form. \\. It is possible that Maine EMS personnel may be called to respond to an individual who has voluntarily entered into an agreement with his/her Attending physician to end their life under the Death with Dignity Act. If dispatched to such a patient, and questions arise regarding patient care, please contact OLMC. Page 156 (Back to TOC) Grey 11 Page 157 Grey 12 (Back to TOC)This protocol provides guidance for the triage, extrication, care and transport of bariatric patients. A bariatric patient exceeds 180 kg (400 lbs.) or possesses a body habitus that challenges the ability of a two-person crew to manage effectively. On scene time may be prolonged for bariatric patients who may require additional resources, personnel and equipment to safely evaluate, manage and transport. Goals include the timely and effective management of these patients while maintaining patient privacy, dignity and comfort. EMT/Advanced EMT/Paramedic: -Equipment: deploy specialized equipment/personnel per local/regional policy. -Request a Bariatric ambulance, if feasible, and if time allows. -Bariatric stretchers are preferred for patient comfort.Ensure that the weight limit of the utilized stretcher exceeds the weight of the patient. -Request additional personnel resources for the extrication process -Clinicians should be knowledgeable about the utilization of bariatric equipment prior to using it. -Early pre-hospital notification is required as special arrangements may be needed at the receiving hospital. -Consider the patient's immediate needs (CT scan, surgery, cardiac catheterization, etc.) when determining hospital destination. If the patient is stable and there exists a potential requirement for alternate destination, please contact OLMC for guidance and discussion regarding the most appropriate patient destination. -If not present, request ALS (Paramedic), especially in situations in which on-scene time will be prolonged.Bariatric Patients EAP PEARLS -It may be difficult to establish IV and IO access. Consider intramuscular or intranasal as alternatives for some medications. For IM, ensure that the needle used is sufficiently long. -Weight-based calculations may yield inappropriately large doses in obese patients. Consult with medical control when in doubt regarding medication dosing. In addition, medication par levels may be exceeded when using weight-based dosing. -Bariatric patients often have decreased functional residual capacity, and are at risk of rapid desaturation. Extremely obese individuals require more oxygen than non-obese individuals due to their diminished lung capacity. Pulse oximetry may not be reliable due to poor circulation. Even patients without respiratory distress may not tolerate the supine position. -Bariatric patients may present with severe airway challenges. Carefully plan your approach to the airway and be prepared with backup airway plans. -If the patient has had recent bariatric surgery, possible complications may include anemia, dehydration, internal leakage at the surgical site, ulcers, localized infection, sepsis, etc.Page 158 Grey 13 (Back to TOC)Mass Casualty/Disasters/HazMat #1 GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECEASED PERSONS: The Office of Chief Medical Examiner is responsible for deceased victims of mass disasters including identification and removal from the scene. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner (1-800-870-8744, restricted emergency call number) should be informed immediately of any multiple fatality situations. 1. BODIES SHOULD BE LEFT IN PLACE AT THE SCENE except when they must be moved to preserve them from destruction or when they block access. The resting place of the victim may be critical for identification of the body and/or reconstruction of the incident. They can be tagged as fatalities to prevent other medical personnel from repeating examination. 2. IF DEATH OCCURS EN ROUTE TO THE HOSPITAL, the body need not be returned to the scene but can be brought to the hospital or other suitable storage place as determined by distances and/or the needs of other patients in the ambulance. If the body is left anywhere other than the hospital or designated temporary morgue, the body should be tagged and the Office of Chief Medical Examiner should be advised. 3. THE SITE A VICTIM IS REMOVED FROM SHOULD BE NOTED on a tag along with the name and agency of the person who removed it whenever removal is needed and in cases of death after removal. Such information may be critical for identification of the body and/or reconstruction of the accident. 4. IF AN IDENTIFICATION OF A PATIENT IS MADE, a tag with at least the name and date of birth and time of death of the patient/decedent along with the identifier?s name, relationship, address and where he/she can be located should be put on the body. 5. PERSONAL PROPERTY SHOULD BE LEFT WITH THE BODY including clothing removed from a patient if the victim dies. Nothing should be removed from those already deceased. Consistent with New England EMS Council MCI Management, the action priorities for the first medical crews arriving on the scene are: 1. Assess and avoid exposure to existing dangers. 2. Notify dispatch of type of MCI and estimate of number and type of patients. a. Request EMS, fire, police assistance b. Request hospital notification 3. First ambulance or other vehicle with medical frequencies becomes EMS command vehicle ? locate near fire and police command vehicles. Strip equipment/supplies ? place in equipment area (near planned patient collection/treatment area). 4. Designate, in the following order, the following positions as qualified personnel become available: EMS CONTROL OFFICER ? Reports to Incident Commander. Responsible for overall patient triage, treatment, and transportation. Procures EMS back-up, supplies, equipment, transport vehicles, as needed, supervises and assigns all other medical personnel. (continued)Page 159 Grey 14 (Back to TOC)Mass Casualty/Disasters/HazMat #2 PRIMARY TRIAGE OFFICER ? Rapidly assesses all patients then assigns personnel to provide treatment to those patients in most need of immediate treatment, who will most benefit from immediate care with the resources available. Treatment is limited to: - Bleeding ? hemorrhage control - Airway ? reposition patient - Shock ? elevate extremities SECONDARY TRIAGE OFFICER ? Rapidly tags all patients, or assigns personnel to do tagging (with METTAGS, SMART Tags, or other locally approved Triage System) and supervises immobilization after classification, and oversees transfer to collection/treatment area. Tag categories are: RED (I): Conditions requiring immediate transport by ambulance to prevent jeopardy to life or limb and which will not unduly deplete personnel/equipment resources (examples: progressive shock, major blood loss, major multiple injuries, severe respiratory distress. Cardiac arrest ? only if personnel can be spared). YELLOW (II): Not requiring immediate transport to prevent jeopardy to life or limb, but eventually will require ambulance transport to hospital for attention. GREEN (III): Minor conditions probably not requiring ambulance transport to hospital. BLACK (O): Are obviously dead, or dying from lethal injuries, or requiring CPR when no personnel are available to do so without compromising other patients. TREATMENT OFFICER ? Sets up / supervises patient collection / treatment area. Reassesses and re-tags (if necessary) patients, assigns patients and personnel to treatment areas. Prioritizes for transport. Coordinates with Loading/Transport Officer to make single radio transmission to receiving facility (pt. ID#, METTAG priority, nature of injury, ambulance, and ETA ONLY). LOADING OFFICER ? Stages ambulances in holding area. Instructs crews to put all available equipment in equipment area. Assigns patients to vehicles. Directs drivers to hospital(s). Instructs not to contact hospital unless OLMC required for condition change. Notifies hospital, or coordinates communication to hospital notification times, patient ID#s and destination of all transporting vehicles. In the event of a public health emergency or declared disaster, EMS clinicians may be asked to divert selected patients with certain conditions to hospital-established or state-established alternate care sites by OLMC. (Continued from previous page)Page 160 Grey 15 (Back to TOC)Suggested Scene Organization (Not for HazMat)Page 161 Grey 16 (Back to TOC)Sexual Assault Victim ALL LEVELS 1. Treat any life-threatening emergency first and according to these protocols. 2. Try to attend to maintenance of forensic evidence. Try not to cut through tears or stains in clothing. Do not cleanse any skin area more than necessary to provide immediate care. 3. If the patient so desires and/or mandated reporting is indicated, police should be called if they have not already been notified. 4. If no life-threatening situation is present, prehospital care may require waiting for police to secure the scene which is a potential crime scene. 5. Victims of sexual assault commonly have much guilt, and may require psychological support. Please respect the stress that they are enduring. 6. By nature of this event, any touch may be traumatic for this patient. Overtly and repeatedly explain what you are doing to try to lessen the impact of procedures and touching. 7. Advise the patient not to eat, drink, smoke, bathe, change clothing or go to the bathroom, if at all possible, in order to preserve any forensic evidence. If they must urinate, request that they do not wipe. 8. If the patient has removed any clothing worn in the assault, each piece of clothing should be separately bagged in paper bags and brought to the hospital with the patient. 9. When transporting the patient, it is preferable, whenever possible, to have a same sex clinician as the primary clinician. If the assault is a same sex assault, then a clinician of the opposite sex may be more comfortable for the patient. 10. To maintain privacy and confidentiality, use a phone for hospital reporting, whenever possible, and do not clarify the type of assault, only that you are transporting a ?victim of assault.? 11. The patient should be encouraged to go to the hospital for a sexual assault forensic examination that would allow not only the option to have collection of forensic evidence, but also treatment of possible injuries, the chance to obtain pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prophylactic treatment, and appropriate counseling. 12. If the patient refuses treatment and/or transportation to the hospital, document all findings and observations as completely as possible. When signing the patient off at the scene, try to have a police officer witness this sign off.Page 162 Grey 17 (Back to TOC)Child Abuse Management and Reporting #1 CHILD ABUSE (Title 22 MRS, Chapter 1071, Subsection 4011-A) All levels - Child abuse and child neglect are sufficiently widespread to guarantee that virtually every EMS clinician will encounter them at least once during his/her career. - It is estimated that approximately 2-3 million cases occur each year, or approximately 11 cases per every 1,000 children within the U.S. Each year at least 2,000 children die from physical abuse. - The most commonly identified forms of abuse by the EMS clinician are physical abuse and severe physical neglect, although sexual abuse may, on occasion, be observed. - The EMS clinician must at all times demonstrate and maintain a supportive and non- judgmental attitude with primary caregivers. Accusation and confrontation delay immediate treatment as well as transportation to a definitive care facility. - When abuse is a possibility, the healthcare professional has two major responsibilities: first, to provide medical care to the child; and second, to collect and document all information that may possibly establish the occurrence of abuse or neglect. Refrain from asking the child too many questions and specifically do not ask any leading questions ? keep questions simple and open-ended such as ?What happened?? and ?Are you hurt?? - As an EMS clinician, you must report immediately to Child Protective Services any child whom you have ?reasonable cause to suspect? has been abused or will be abused. Failure to do so is punishable as a civil violation. It is not enough to tell someone else of your suspicions. If a child is abused and unreported, there is a 50% chance that the child will be abused again and a 10% chance that the child will die from future abuse. Possible Indicators of Abuse 1. Injured child under two years of age, especially hot water burns or fractures 2. Facial, mouth, or genital injuries 3. Atypical, diffuse, and/or severe injuries ? especially when not over bony prominences 4. Poor nutrition or poor care 5. Delay in seeking treatment or not wanting the clinician to speak alone with the child 6. Vague, inconsistent, or changing history 7. Refer to appropriate protocol for the child with altered level of consciousness, Gold 5, the child in shock, Gold 14, or the child in cardiac arrest, Red 8 Treatment of suspected child abuse in the field 1. Suspect abuse but do not accuse the caretaker. Every time a child is encountered by the healthcare professional having a traumatic injury, the question that should come to mind is, ?Could this be abuse??. In most cases, the answer will be an obvious ?no?; however, enough uncertainty will exist in some cases to warrant further assessment. 2. Follow normal initial assessment priorities of the ABC?s and mental status when caring for the child. 3. Provide the appropriate intervention procedures for any abnormal findings such as respiratory, trauma, shock, altered mental status or other medical emergencies. (continued)Page 163 Grey 18 (Back to TOC)Child Abuse Management and Reporting #2 4. EMS clinicians are in key positions to assess environmental conditions and the observable interactions of family and child. Environmental signs of possible abuse or neglect may include, but are not limited to: unsanitary conditions; garbage scattered about the house; unsafe conditions such as open, unguarded windows or potentially dangerous objects within reach of children. 5. Perform a detailed physical examination on any child in stable enough condition to allow for such. Examine all parts of the body for deformities, ecchymosis, lacerations, abrasions, punctures, burns, tenderness, and swelling. It is vitally important that injuries of the mouth and sternum be observed in detail prior to the initiation of resuscitative measures and documented that such injuries were found prior to resuscitation. 6. It is important to transport all children having evidence of abuse or neglect due to the possibility of additional injuries not immediately obvious. Transport of potentially abused or neglected children ensures that they receive the appropriate and necessary social service. Assistance may be necessary from law enforcement, OLMC, etc. 7. Convey your impressions and information to the hospital staff. 8. Write a detailed and descriptive report, which provides an accurate and clear record of all observations and treatment from the time of the initial call through transfer of the patient to the ED staff. Do not make a diagnosis of abuse, and refrain from including personal opinions, emotional overtones, or interpretations. Primary caregiver quoted statements must be documented as such with quotation marks, and exactly word for word as stated by the person. As well, this legal document must be legible. 9. You must contact Adult (1-800-624-8404) and Children?s (1-800-452-1999) Emergency Services to make a report. This is a 24-hour a day reporting number. You will be protected, by law, from civil liability for making such a report, if made in good faith. Title 22 MRS, Chapter 1071, Subsection 4014 AN ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE LAWS GOVERNING MANDATORY REPORTING OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT.

If there is a question of decision making capacity or the patient does not appear to understand the consequences of his/her refusal of transport, then contact OLMC. 2. The patient must be informed of the consequences of his/her refusal to be transported. This must be documented in the patient care report. 3. This screening may typically arise when an ambulance is requested by someone other than the patient (i.e. the police, a bystander). The EMS run report must always be completed. 4. If the patient refuses transport and is judged to be without decision making capacity, the EMS clinician must speak directly with OLMC. If unable to reach OLMC, the patient is transported. 5. EMS System initiated patient sign offs are tremendously risky interactions and are not condoned by Maine EMS. 6. The service is expected to review all patient sign offs through the service?s quality assurance mechanism. Patient medical records must be completed for all of these interactions,and must include the following information: a. The patient must be calm, competent, sober, and alert with the absence of any acute medical/surgical or traumatic process that impairs the patient?s decision-making capacity b. Greater than 18 years, emancipated, or contact with guardian c. Service(s) offered d. Reason service(s) declined e. Statement of risks and patient understanding of risk f. Discussion of alternatives to service offered and potential consequences of declining offered service g. Discussion with patient that EMS services may be accessed at any time, and that the patient had decision making capacity.EMS Clinician Assesses Patient Patient Accepts Treatment/Transport? Patient Transported Decision-Making Capacity* TransportedNO Grey 21 (Back to TOC)Transport Protocol #2 7. In some circumstances, patient transport is requested by an off site medical clinician. Should a patient refuse transport and be found to have decision making capacity, EMS clinicians should communicate the discovery of decision making capacity and the patient?s right to refuse transfer with invested parties. OLMC, or the physician ordering transport, must be contacted by EMS in this decision making process. It is suggested that the consulted physician discuss the refusal of care or transport directly with the patient. 8. When the patient is found to lack decision-making capacity but continues to refuse transport, contact OLMC for assistance. Should the patient continue to refuse transport, consider accessing other community advocates and resources (such as family/friend when appropriate and/or police). Consider direct dialogue between OLMC and the patient or OLMC and law enforcement to assist in resolving the conflict.(Continued from previous page)Page 167 Grey 22 (Back to TOC)Protective Headgear Removal The decision to remove protective headgear from an injured patient rests with the EMS clinician on scene unless a Maine licensed physician is on scene and takes responsibility for the patient. It is important to immobilize the patient in a neutral in-line position, regardless of whether or not you choose to remove the helmet. This requires that you evaluate each patient and determine if other equipment (i.e. shoulder pads) must be removed or if additional padding under the shoulders or head is necessary. In the case of an athletic injury, the EMS clinician should consider input from athletic trainers. Disputes should be referred to OLMC for resolution. When deciding whether to remove protective headgear, please evaluate the following criteria: Can You Access the Airway? Does the Helmet Fit Snugly? Can you adequately immobilize the spine while maintaining neutral in-line position?

If encountering a possible crime scene and not previously dispatched, contact law enforcement. Once a crime scene is deemed safe by law enforcement, initiate patient contact and medical care, if necessary. -Do not sacrifice patient care to preserve evidence. -Have all EMS clinicians use the same path of entry and exit, if feasible. -Do not touch or move anything at a crime scene unless it is necessary to do so for patient care (notify law enforcement prior to moving, if possible). -Do not walk through fluids. -Observe and document original location of items moved by crew whenever possible. -Do not sacrifice patient care to preserve clothing, but when possible and removing patient clothing is required, leave it as intact as possible. Avoid cutting through holes made by weapons, if possible. -If you remove any items from the scene, such as impaled objects or medication bottles, document your actions and advise a law enforcement official (prior to removal, if feasible). -Consider requesting a law enforcement officer to accompany the patient in the ambulance to the hospital. -Document statements made by the patient or bystanders on the EMS patient care report. Report significant information to a law enforcement official prior to leaving the scene, if feasible. -Comments made by a patient or bystanders should be denoted in quotation marks. -Inform staff at the receiving hospital that this is a ?crime scene? patient. -If the patient is obviously dead, consistent with Do Not Resuscitate Guidelines, Grey 1, notify law enforcement of decision not to initiate resuscitation/patient care. -At motor vehicle incidents, preserve the scene by not driving over debris, not moving debris and parking away from tire marks, if feasible. -Prior to leaving a crime scene, if feasible, check the bottom of your shoes for contamination (fluids, objects, etc.). Notify law enforcement for removal of any evidence and possible photographing of your shoes.Page 169 Grey 24 (Back to TOC)Defibrillation/Cardioversion Settings Initial Second Third Subsequent AdultPer device recommendations* If unknown, use maximum available energyMaximum available energy Maximum available energy Pediatric 2 J/kg 4 J/kg 6 J/kg Max 10 J/kgDEFIBRILLATION SETTINGS* * Each device manufacturer recommends initial adult defibrillation settings.

These protocols are not part of the standard prehospital patient care protocols.Page 182 OD Green 1 (Back to TOC)Operational K9 Protocols Intro The Medical Direction and Practices Board recognizes that EMS clinicians may work with Operational K9s [OpK9] as part of their job (with search and rescue or law enforcement teams). While the handler of the canine is ultimately responsible for their dog, they may grant permission for trained EMS personnel to provide care for their canine partner. At no time should the care of an OpK9 take priority over a person. It is vital that the EMS personnel who meet the requirements below have a working relationship with the OpK9 handlers well in advance of needing to implement these protocols. Only clinicians who have successfully completed a Maine EMS-approved K9 medicine course may access these protocols. That clinician must seek approval from the MDPB prior to access. This will require the following: 1. Documentation of successful course completion 2. Documented affiliation/MOU with the service that deploys operational K9s 3. Established relationship with an accepting veterinary clinic 4. Documentation of training with said affiliated K9 service 5. The EMS clinician will be in good standing with Maine EMS MRS Title 14, Chapter 7, subsection 164-B, Immunity from civil liability for assistance given to law enforcement dogs, search and rescue dogs and service dogs, was passed in 2017. This statute provides protections for emergency medical services clinicians who render aid to a working dog (please refer to statute for details). At this time, these protocols do NOT apply to service dogs. Service dogs are defined by the ADA as a dog specifically trained to perform work for a person with a disability. Examples include guide dogs, medic alert dogs, and emotional support/psychiatric service dogs. It is expected that clinicians maintain clinical competency and attend continuing education courses pertaining to the care of the Operational K9. Denotes a potentially complex canine patient. Please consult the veterinarian to collaborate your effortsPage 183 OD Green 2 (Back to TOC)These canine guidelines are reserved for use only on Operational K9s who are injured or become ill while on duty. Ill or injured humans always take priority over canines. The goal is to safely provide the canine's initial medical evaluation, treatment and transport to definitive care. Injured and ill canines may pose an unintentional threat to clinicians, therefore it is imperative that the canine be secured prior to medical evaluation. This is best done by the canine's handler. It is preferable that the handler stay with their canine throughout all phases of care, evacuation, and transport unless they, themselves, are injured or required for threat neutralization. If the primary handler is not available, attempt to locate another handler or person that is familiar with handling OpK9s to secure and stay with the injured canine. All injured canines should be muzzled before handling. The following are relative contraindications to muzzling: 1. Unconsciousness 2. Upper airway obstruction 3. Vomiting 4. Severe facial trauma 5. Heat-related injury (need to allow evaporative cooling via panting). If these canines need to be muzzled, a Cage- or Basket-type muzzle is preferred. EMT/AEMT/PARAMEDIC Muzzling 1. The type of muzzle used depends on the size of the of canine, available material, type of injury and desired canine access. Operational K9 Restraint #1 EAP Muzzle Type Required Materials Suggested Use Cage or BasketManufactured cage/basket muzzle (preferably made out of rubber)~All-purpose ~Preferred muzzle: allows for open-mouth breathing FabricManufactured, All-purpose Quick muzzleAny available, inches) tape, leash, webbing, gauze, etc.~Use only if fabric or cage/basket muzzle is unavailable ~Narrow tape/gauze etc. can cause injury (continued)Page 184 OD Green 3 (Back to TOC)Operational K9 Restraint #2 AEP(continued from previous page) 2. The canine should be restrained in a position of comfort, which may include sitting or standing. Do not restrain the canine in such a manner that its ability to breathe or pant is impeded. 3. Slide the appropriately-sized muzzle over the canine's snout from the rostral (anterior) to caudal (posterior) aspect. Be sure that the lower jaw is captured in the muzzle and not free. 4. Be sure to frequently check the security of the muzzle and make sure that it is not impeding the canine's ability to breathe. **It is important that the clinician be adequately trained to restrain the Operational K9 in order to safely apply a muzzle. A stressed canine may not only bite the EMS clinician or others, but may bite its handler as well.**Page 185 OD Green 4 (Back to TOC)Operational K9 Airway Obstruction #1 EPAThese canine guidelines are reserved for use only on Operational K9s who are injured or become ill while on duty. Ill or injured humans always take priority over canines. Clinical signs of airway obstruction include the following: -Gagging -Pawing at the mouth -Excessive drooling -Frequent swallowing motions -Extension of the head and neck -Tripod position -Reluctance to lie down -Cyanosis (late sign) Similar to a person who can speak clearly without any respiratory distress, consider a canine that is barking, growling, or whining without any clinical signs of respiratory distress to have a patent airway. EMT/AEMT/PARAMEDIC 1. Allow for position of comfort (sit or stand, sternal helps with gravity) 2. Secure canine with leash/rope 3. Avoid putting hands in canine's mouth (serious injury to clinician can occur) 4. Attempt Heimlich maneuver (avoid if sharp object involved) a. \"Bear hug\"or lay canine on side and place fist just below sternum or behind ribs b. Five (5) quick and upward abdominal thrusts followed by airway check c. If not successful, repeat 1-2 times 5. Palpate throat/trachea - you may be able to dislodge a supraglottic foreign body cephalad out of the pharynx. a. Palpate the object at the supraglottic region (ventral mandible) b. From caudal aspect of object, squeeze/push cranially i. Two-handed with both thumbs, or ii. Single-handed with thumb and index or middle finger Pharyngo-laryngeal manipulation (continued)Page 186 OD Green 5 (Back to TOC)6. In an unconscious canine, open the airway by extending the head and neck, and pull the tongue forward. A second rescuer may use gauze/leash looped behind upper canine teeth to keep the mouth open. You may use a second length of gauze/leash for the lower jaw as well. 7. In an unconscious canine, if the obstruction is: a. VISIBLE: attempt to manually remove; do not push foreign body further back in airway b. NOT VISIBLE: do not attempt a blind finger sweep due to risk of pushing the foreign body further down the airway 8. If object is not removed and canine collapses, provide chest compressions and mouth-to-snout or BVM (with a canine mask). If unable to get chest rise, proceed to Airway Management protocol, OD Green 6 and Cardiac Arrest protocol, OD Green 10.Operational K9 Airway Obstruction #2 EAP(continued from 187 Green 6 (Back to TOC)Operational K9 Airway Management #1 E PAThese canine guidelines are reserved for use only on Operational K9s who are injured or become ill while on duty.

Finger probes used for people do not work well in canines. If possible, obtain and use a flat ear probe attachment. Place the probe on the tongue or non-pigmented portion of the lip. In conscious dogs, use the ear pinna, lip fold, inguinal skin fold or prepuce/vulva; although not optimal for oximetry, these alternate sites generally yield reliable results in most instances.

Ill or injured humans always take priority over canines. WARNING: CONTACT WITH THESE TOXINS CAN BE FATAL TO RESCUERS CONSIDER SCENE SAFETY AND DECONTAMINATION Don appropriate PPE as opioid exposure is often due to contact with the opioid in powder form and cross contamination can occur between the OpK9, handler, and EMS clinician. Please alert the Veterinary Hospital as soon as feasibly possible so that they can take appropriate precautions as well. Opioid overdose in canines is manifested primarily by excessive sedation, bradycardia, and hypothermia. Canines are less susceptible than humans to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. EMT 1. Administer O2, as appropriate 2. Manage airway providing rescue breaths if RR < 8, see OD Green 6 3. Consider securing canine with muzzle in anticipation of reversal of opioid 4. If it is suspected that the canine came into contact with an opioid and is showing symptoms of opioid overdose, administer: a.

Cool by bringing to a shaded or lightly air-conditioned area. If no A/C available, use circulating fan to blow a light breeze by the canine 7. As feasible, remove muzzles, harnesses, tactical gear, etc. 8. Place on a cool surface to promote conductive cooling 9. Offer cool water and encourage drinking 10. Ensure the canine is afforded ample time to rest and recover where they are displaying no signs of heat stress. 11. Monitor vital signs every 5 minutes; discontinue cooling efforts when core temp is 104F or less. 12. Ideally, these canines should not return to work or participate in outdoor activity for the rest of the day. Moderate Heat Injury (heat exhaustion) 13. Follow guidelines above and start active external cooling a. Use cooling fans or air conditioning to reduce core body temperature b. Place cold compresses or wrapped in towels on the head and neck as well as the axillae and groin. Avoid placing ice packs on the limbs as this shunts hot blood back to the core. c. Douse or spray body with cold water; soak hair to skin with cold water and use fans or A/C to cool further. 14. Monitor vital signs every 5 minutes; discontinue cooling efforts when core temp reaches 104F 15. Dry canine off, place on dry surface and avoid direct application of air on canine from circulating fans or A/C. 16. Continue to monitor temperature every 10 minutes for at least the next few hours as body temperature may continue dropping to the subnormal range or rise excessively again. a. If body temperature drops below 100F (rebound hypothermia) consider passive warming by covering with blankets or other similar materials 17.

For mild allergic reactions/cutaneous allergies, the handler may administer 4 mg/kg diphenhydramine PO E A P PEARLS In canines, cutaneous (i.e. urticaria/hives, pruritis/itching) signs of allergies are uncommon. However, with progression to anaphylaxis, clinical signs are most often associated with the cardiovascular (CV) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Respiratory signs may also develop, along with seizures and anxiousness, progressing to weakness and collapse. Signs include: -CV: tachycardia, weakness, weak pulses, mucous membrane color changes -GI/GU: urinating, vomiting, and diarrhea that is often bloody -Respiratory: increased respiratory effort, wheezes, and crackles IV diphenhydramine can cause significant hypotension, therefore give IM Page 205 OD Green 24 (Back to TOC)Operational K9 Gastric Dilation and Volvulus (GDV) E PAThese canine guidelines are reserved for use only on Operational K9s who are injured or become ill while on duty. Ill or injured humans always take priority over canines. GDV (aka \"bloat\") progresses very rapidly and recognizing the symptoms in the canine quickly can save their life. Initial signs are often associated with abdominal pain. These can include, but are not limited to: -an anxious look or looking at the abdomen -extreme agitation due to acute pain -standing and stretching, head and tail down with an arched back -pacing, accompanied with the inability to sit or lay down comfortably -drooling -distending abdomen -retching without producing anything except excessive saliva - this is the most common symptom, and sounds like dry-heaving but can sometimes sound like a repeated cough.
