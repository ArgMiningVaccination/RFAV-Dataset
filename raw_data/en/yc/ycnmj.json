We're in a time like no other, there are so many different stresses that we're under that are complicating how our body and our health works, this makes it increasingly difficult to make connections on anything. Each day we learn more and more, which is what has caused so much concern about coronavirus, the vaccine and side effects of the two. Is Vertigo a Symptom of COVID? One thing to keep in mind is that dizziness is a very nonspecific term which describes a broad type of symptoms. Vertigo and lightheadedness specifically have been associated with COVID; you may even continue to experience vertigo after COVID recovery. Vertigo is the sensation that you or your environment is spinning uncontrollably, making you dizzy and disoriented, whereas lightheadedness is feeling like you are about to faint. You may also feel dizzy but not as though you or your surroundings are moving. Does the Vaccine Cause Vertigo? While there has definitely been a rise in the amount of people suffering with vertigo issues, whether or not COVID, vertigo and the vaccine are related is hard to say. There are many factors that could contribute to vertigo such as: - Wearing Face Masks - While face masks may protect you from the spread of COVD-19, prolonged use of masks over a period of time alters the amount of oxygen that enters the body, which could cause adverse side effects over time. - Change in lifestyle - Many of us have recently had to alter our lives quite drastically due to the pandemic. Sitting at your desk for extended periods of time could cause the cervical spine to compress due to poor sitting posture and could contribute to vertigo. - High stress - The pandemic has affected everyone and has put a lot of emotional and physical stress on the population. This high level of stress could be another thing factoring into the rise of vertigo symptoms. Unfortunately, there simply isn't enough research yet to accurately determine if the vaccine is responsible for vertigo. According to a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34267103/) conducted by Otology & Neurotology, there are no definite correlations to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination on new or worsening vertigo symptoms. More research will have to be done before we really know. There was also a recent article published by the British Journal of Medicine and their investigation report, critiquing the methods and processes in which these vaccines we are told to take go about being researched. This only brings more questions about how these vaccines and COVID-19 itself can affect our bodies. Treating Vertigo Whether your vertigo was caused by the vaccine or another underlying condition, seeking professional help is your best option. Making sure that your brain can connect to your body is also an essential tool in making sure that you can fight off any virus, bacteria or stressor that you're running into, and be as healthy as you can be.
