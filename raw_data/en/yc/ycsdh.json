And My Beloved Nephew : Sri Praganesh as I write this in your loving memory . iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My thesis would have been impossible without my mentor, Dr. Viviana Gradinaru. I am extremely fortunate to have met her early on in my career . She has been an amazing mentor to me till date. Every day she inspires me to do more than what I think I am capable of , and it helped me a lot to grow under her guidance. She is the best mentor I could have ever asked for. She is like a \"Superwoman\" to me who I admire everyday on her skills to actively balance an outstanding career that involv es a lot of hard wor k, every single day , while also maintaining all her other roles in her personal life as a wife, mother and daughter . Her wisdom and foresightedness have helped me a lot in shaping my professional a s well as personal life . She has been extremely kind and supportive as a friend and as a mentor in the most difficult times in my personal life. I am very grateful to her for her support. She stands out as someone who deeply cares about the health and wellbeing of people around her, which I think is a rare virtue in today's fast -paced productiv ity-focused world . She created an extremely diverse scientific environment where over the years I had pursued projects that were in very different scientific disciplines, and that motivated me to stay in her lab to pursue my graduate study. The lab meetings would look more or less like a department seminar as everyone dwelled on very different areas of science. Over the years, I felt there was a lot of learning on a day -to-day basis, and I c an't imagine any other lab where I could have gained this knowledge . This knowledge rich environment helped me grow to become independent as well as to actively collaborate with other scientists in lab. I admire Dr. Gradinaru for being extremely kind and g enerous. I can't think of a mentor who would just give away a planery talk at a prestigious conference, let alone to a graduate student. I am very grateful to her for believing in me , allowing me to take up different responsibilities over the years, and for giving me all the wonderful opportunities to grow intellectually , professionally and personally. I hope I can manage to live up to her expectations. I'm extremely grateful to Dr. Benjamin Deverman , who introduced me to the science of vector engineering , and who closely mentored and trained me during his time at Caltech. This thesis would have been impossible without his mentorship. I got to know him a few months before I entered the graduate program and it was around that time when I decided what I absol utely wanted to do for my doctoral thesis. He taught me the importance of asking the right questions that can have a direct impact in the scientific community , and society at large. It was an absolute pleasure to work under his mentorship , and I look up to him for several reasons: his integrity, his patience to pursue challenges, and his foresightedness, and also for being a thorough, smart, and hardworking scientist. Above all, what I admire most about him is that he is such a warm and fun -loving person in the workspace and outside, and that it is an absolute pleasure to have him as a mentor and as a friend. Even outside lab, w e shared memorable times exploring food in LA, his house parties, and an uphill biking adventure where he almost got me killed on wh at was supposedly a fun 9 -mile-ride for a cause. Thank you for everything , Ben. This work would have been impossible with out my colleagues in Dr. Gradinaru's lab . First and foremost, I would like to thank Xinhong Chen, for being an amazing and cheerful v lab mate , and a friend who has been part of my every day activities in the lab . I admire him for his selflessness, energy, motivation, hard work and his positive attitude, and it is an absolute pleasure to work with him. He knew how to keep me on my toes. Outside lab, w e also shared some great memorable times given our love for food and boba tea . I would like to thank Dr. Tim Miles for being a great lab mate and a friend as I actively collaborate with him on our projects , and in the process I learnt a lot . He has been extremely helpful in times of need , and it's been a n absolute pleasure to brainstorm ideas with him , and I 'm very thankful to all those intellectual conversations that I've had with him in the recent year which helped me to shape my thesis. I am very thankful to him for all the times in lab and outside that we shared during my graduate school. I would also like to thank Dr. Ken Chan for being a great friend and colleague during his time at Caltech. He kept the environment light and fun, and he tra ined me on several techniques, and I am very thankful for his time and effort. We also shared a lot of good memories outside lab as we explored the food and the city , and I feel very fortunate to have him as my friend till date . I am also very fortunate an d thankful to have met Dr. Jennifer Treweek, the queen of prankster in lab , and we shared many great memories in lab and outside , as she continued to remind me of the importance to never grow old to have fun, and it definitely cheered me up to get through some of the dark, non - productive days . She is someone I look up to for her voracious appetite for knowledge and thoroughness; and I'm very thankful to her for teaching me the science and techniques in lab. I'm very thankful to Dr. Ryan Cho for being a grea t colleague and friend, and who also introduced me to Korean food and movies, and we had a wonderful time both in lab and outside. I'm very thankful to Dr. Alon Greenbaum who is absolutely wonderful to work with, and apart from being a great coworker, I'm fortunate to have his friendship and advice in shaping my professional and personal life.

They were wonderful co -workers , and above all were a great pal in the lab and outside . They brought a healthy work culture and fun environment that made my years at Caltech very pleasant and memorable. I would also like to thank my committee members: Dr. Carlos Lois, Dr. Mitchel l Guttman, and Dr. Rebecca Voorhees in addition to my advisor, Dr. Gradinaru for their time and advice on my thesis, and am deeply honored that they agreed to be on my committee. I would also like to thank other faculty members at Caltech who I've had th e opportunity to interact and be mentored. I'm extremely grateful to Dr. Dianne K. Newman who I have had the wonderful opportunity to be mentored on a collaborative project with Dr. Gradinaru lab. She is someone who inspired me with her intellect, humility , and kindness, and I was deeply honored to work under her mentorship. I'm extremely grateful to Dr. Mikhail G. Shapiro , who gave me the wonderful opportunity to rotate in his lab during my 1st year of graduate school, and it was an absolute pleasure to wo rk under his mentorship. vi This work wouldn't have been possible if not for being at an outstanding place like Caltech. I started my journey at Caltech in late 2012 as a Scientific Researcher in Dr. Viviana Gradinaru's lab and since then I 've had the great privilege to engage with the brilliant scientists in this community who inspired me every day not just to become a better scientist but also remain humbled. Without any doubts, I can say that the valuable lessons learnt during my Caltech years are going to help me navigate through the rest of my scientific career and life in general. I am very grateful to the Graduate School office, International Student office, and Graduate Student Housing for being extremely kind and helpful in times of dire needs and am very thankful for all their generous support, time , and efforts till date. I'm also thankful to the Caltech research facilities, especially Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory, Dr. Igor Antoshechkin and Caltech Biological Imaging fac ility, and Dr. Andres Collazo and the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources (OLAR) for their time and service; their contributions were pivotal to my thesis . I'm very grateful to Dr. Nagendranath Reddy for offering generous awards to female graduate stude nts in Biology, and I'm deeply honored to be a recipient of his prestigious fellowship. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank some of my previous mentors who had a significant role to play towards my scientific training. I'm very grateful to Dr. Baskar Gurunathan, my research advisor from my undergraduate years who gave me the first opportunity to do science. Th ose early years of training were very helpful to motivate me towards a higher education in biology . I'm very grateful and fortunate t o have met Dr. James A. Imlay, my research advisor for my Master' s thesis, early on in my life, who first trained me to be come an independent researcher. I was extremely lucky to work under his mentorship , and the lessons learnt back then helped me in my Caltech years, and will continue to help me throughout my scientific c areer and life in general . My thesis wouldn't have been possible without my family's support system. I'm very fortunate to have grow n up in a family where I was encouraged to pursue m y dreams . My dad, Srividya Srinivasan, have supported me with my goals throughout, and without their constant motivation and their presence, I wouldn't be where I'm right now. And I hope that someday I can live up to their expectations. I would like to use this opportunity to acknowledge the significant people in my life who were with me in my highs and lows in the past years . Dr. Anupama Lakshmanan, my friend and ex -roommate, was an absolut e pleasure to be with and she made my years at Caltech memorable and cheerful as we enjoyed exploring the city, food and entertainment together. I'm very fortunate to have such a caring friend and as I write this she checks in to make sure I am on track wi th my thesis. Aarathi Shanmugam, my friend since my undergraduate years , has been with me on every step ever since and am very fortunate to have her in my life.

To this end, my thesis focuses on modifying the recombinant adeno -associated viral (rAAV) vectors that are identified as a safer choice for cargo delivery compared to other known viral vectors . They are widely used in the scientific communities, have seen promising outcomes in gene therapy clinical trials , and as of today have three products approved to use in humans. However, the natural repertoire of rAAVs have broad tropis m when delivered systemically, and there is room for further improvement on the efficiency and specificity, especially for gene delivery in the central nervous system (CNS). The prior work done in Dr. Gradinaru lab addresses the issue by using a directed e volution approach called CREATE, Cre recombination -based AAV targeted evolution , to identify AAV -PHP.B and AAV -PHP.eB capsids, which broadly transduce the CNS (Deverman et al, 2016; Chan et al, 2017). CREATE selects for functional lox-flipped viral DNA that crosses the blood -brain barrier (BBB) and successfully transduces a specific nerve cell -type expressing Cre , thereby appl ying a strong selection pressure . However , the method is limited by its ability to identify a handful of enriched variants , and may a lso be prone to false positives resulting from experimental biases. The effort to fully understand the selection landscape , and to select for capsids that are not just efficient towards a cell -type but also specific to wards it, led to the development of Multiplexed -CREATE (M -CREATE). M - CREATE allows parallel positive selections across different cell -types of interest , enables post-hoc negative selections across off -targets using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) based capsid recovery , and retain s the princ iples of Cre -dependent functional recovery from CREATE . The method has a synthetic library generation approach to minimize biases within selection rounds, a variant replicate feature to identify the signal versus noise within a biological system, and an an alysis pipeline to group families of enriched variants based on amino acid motifs , all of which together increases the confidence in the outcome and the throughput from a single experiment. Selection s across brain endothelial cells, neurons , and astrocytes yielded several AAV -PHP.B transduce CNS, variants that can efficiently transduce the vascular cells forming the BBB, a AAV - ix PHP.N variant that transduces neurons with greater specificity , and AAV -PHP.C variants that cross the BBB without murine strain specificity across tested strains . The AAV -PHP.C variants have different amino acid motifs compared to the AAV -PHP.Bs that have been previously shown to have limited CNS transduction across some mouse strains due to its interaction with the strain specific host cell surface receptor, ly6a, a homolog of which is not found in humans. (Hordeaux et al, 2018, Hordeaux et al, 2019; Huang et al, 2019; Batista et al, 2019) Therefore AAV -PHP.Cs offer s ome hope towards translation across other species. In summary, the M -CREATE methodology turns out to be a high -confidence , robust selection platform to yield several novel viral capsids for use in neuroscience and potential gene therapy related applications. Figure 1.1: Concept of Multiplexed -CREATE x M-CREATE is a high -confidence, multiplexed, in vivo selection platform that yields vectors (i.e., viral capsids) with desired tropisms. M -CREATE identifies positively enriched vectors from on -target tissues or cell types that are also ne gatively enriched across off-targets through next -generation sequencing (NGS) -based vector recovery. The selected vector libraries are subjected to clustering based on the shared mutation patterns (or motifs) to identify distinct families of vectors, there by generating multiple candidates to address gene delivery challenges. xi PUBLISHED CONTENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS Ravindra Ku mar, S., Miles , T.

VECTORS FOR GENE DELIVERY One of the fundamental needs in biolog y are tools to study cells or associated pathologies , and eventually design therapies to treat the impaired cells . At a cellular level, all of the above involve an exogenous supply of genes encoding proteins of interest. Molecular tools than can package a desired gene and deliver it to a cell are called vectors or vehicles. Vectors can turn out to be the most powerful tool for a biologist if we can design them to precisely target a cell -type of interest efficiently , and can become a vital resource across various disciplines , such as in basic and biomedical science s and in clinics. The gene deli very vectors can be broadly classified based on the source as non - viral and viral vectors. Non-viral vectors The non -viral delivery systems comprise chemical and biochemical vectors such as lipid-based vectors, peptide -based vectors, natural and synthetic polymers , calcium phosphates , and metal nanoparticles1-11. The se non-viral vectors are attractive for their biosafety aspect given their synthetic nature, and thereby their inability to elicit strong 2 immune response in the host . However , these non -viral vectors are limited in their applications due to lower transfection efficiency , and have been designed only for fewer target cell population given the time, cost , and labor involved in engineering such vectors12- 15. Viral vectors Viruses that are known to infect mammalian cells are naturally existing vectors, and they are subjected to engineering by making them replication deficient, stripping them of their toxic genome , and replac ing it with our gene of interest to serve as a safe gene delivery vector (alias recombinant viral vector) . Some vi ruses have been recognized and engineered for this purpose including; lentivirus, , rabies, and baculovirus. However, depending on the viral vectors, they have their own pros and cons including tropisms, transduction efficiency and specificity , stability of transgene expression, cytotoxicity, and immune response , all of which influence their potential applications in science and therapies16-19. Some notable vectors are highlighted below. Retroviruses Retroviruses are RNA viruse s, and were the first to be recognized and engineered as a viral vector in the 1980s20, and they eventually entered the first gene therapy clinical trial in the 1990s for adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA)21. However, the use of retroviral vectors observed a majo r setback due to its innate ability to randomly integrate into host genome , which may at times lead to insertional oncogenesis22-25. Hence, the issues associated with the use of these vectors limit their applications26-30. Lentivirus Lentivirus is a RNA retrovirus , and the recombinant v iral vectors31-34 stands out for its ability to transduce both dividing and non -dividing cells35-37. Given its broad tropism, these recombinant viral vectors have gained a lot of attention in both basic science applications38- 3 42 and in gene therapy43-45. However, even with the continuous engineering efforts to reduce the random integration events into host geno me, the risk is not eliminated46. Adenovirus (AD) Adenoviruses are non -enveloped, icosahedral, double -stranded DNA viruses that are widely used as gene delivery vectors47-49, and also as recombinant viral vaccines50-52. ADs are attractive for their ability to exist as episomal DNA (extra -chromosomal DNA that does not integrate with host DNA), to package large genome s53 and modified tropisms through engineering54,55. However, one of the major drawbacks for gene therapy application is their ability to induc e strong host innate imm une responses56,57, such as the one seen in the 18 -year-old Jesse Gelsinger case, where a fatal inflammatory resp onse in days after administer ing AD packa ged with ornithine -transcarbamylase led to his death58,59. 1.2. ADENO -ASSOCIATE D VIRAL VECTORS FOR GENE DELIVERY Adeno -associated virus (AAV) AAV s are 25 nm, non -enveloped, icosahedral (formed from 60 monomers), DNA parvo virus es with a single -stranded 4.7 kb genome60-65. AAVs are replication incompetent , and depend on a second virus for infection such as AD or HSV66. The genome carries two genes: rep and cap, comprising the Rep proteins (Rep78, Rep68, Rep52, Rep40) that coordinate AAV replication67, a capsid assembly -activating protein (AAP)68 and a membrane associated accessory protein (MAAP)69 from alternate open reading frame s, and capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3) that form the capsid coat70. These genes are flanked by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) which are packaging signals for the genome and are involved in 2nd strand DNA synthesis in the host cell , and also has a terminal resolution site to enable site specific integration i nto human chromosome 19 (AAV S1)71-74. Advantages of using rAAVs as vectors for gene delivery 4 What makes rAAVs appealing for in vivo gene delivery applications is their latent (or harmless) infection without the helper virus66,75,76, and most of the viral genome can be stripped off to insert the cargo of interest as the only viral sequences required within the rAAV genome are the ITRs (145 bases on either end of the genome )77-79. The vectors are non-pathogenic , and have been shown to exhibit low immunogenic response . Their long- term persistence as episomal DNA in transduced cells lower s the risk of random chromosomal integration events that are otherwise observed with retroviruses . All of the above features make them a safer choice of gene delivery vector over other viruses. Above all their ability to transduce both dividing and non -dividing cells makes them widely usable for various applications61,78,80 -85. Current AAV vector applications Vectors can find their applications across various disciplines in science. Basic Science There has bee n more acceptance in usin g the rAAV viral vectors in laboratories all over the world to address a myriad of science questions that requires delivery of genes to a specific target of interest. The scientific needs involve delivering a specific or multiple genes under -investigation which includes an endogenous gene, an actuator, a sensor, or a reporter86. This could be easily achieved with rAAV viral vectors87. rAAVs have been used in applications like cell circuits tracing88, probing cellular activity using techniques like optogenetics or chemogenetics89, building disease models90, etc. The current alternative experimental setup using transgenic animals carr ying a modified gene has limitations such as the cost and time involved in generation and maintenance of transgenic lines. The growing needs to cover the diverse cell populations or pathological conditions under investigation limits its applications91-93. Compared to transgenics, the gene delivery vectors are easier and faster to implement; they could be used to deliver broadly across various targets under investigation, higher tissue or cell -type specificity based on the mode of vector delivery, the 5 nature of the cargo, or by the use of engineered vectors; and they allow time -controllable gene delivery in a host , which is c rucial for studying pathologies87,93. Biomedical Science The use of AAV viral vectors for drug discov ery in vivo can speed up progress in these areas of research , thereby increasing the potential to identify new therapeutic targets , and therefore newer therapies94-98. Gene therapy Gene therapy is a methodology that uses identified therapeutic genes to be delivered to the disease d cells to repair the loss of function . rAAVs, i n addition to their predominant use in science, are promising vectors in gene therapies too for treating monogenetic disorders99-101. The first long term persistence of gene expression in mammalian brain by rAAV based gene delivery led to a great start in 1990s102, which then quickly followed with the first human gene therapy trial for cystic fibrosis (CF)103. In 2008, rAAV was shown to have promising outcome to treat leber congenital amarosus (LCA)104-106. Three rAAV based gene therapies have been approved till date to use in clinics. In 2012, the first gene replacement therapy using rAAV based drug named Glybera, was approved by the European Regulatory Commission (ERC) to treat lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD)107. In 2017, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap proved the first rAAV based gene therapy in US, named Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec -rzyl) to correct RPE65 mutation 2019, FDA approved (onasemnogene abeparvovec ) to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)111,112. In addition to these approved therap ies, currently ~14% of the gene therapies that have entered the clinical trials uses rAAVs, which is at 2nd position following ~27% using vaccinia virus . Other trials comprise ~11% or retrovirus es, ~6% using LVs, using HSV . Current limitations of AAVs 6 While the properties of AAVs certainly account for their use in research labs and clinics, their use needs a significant improvement on the transduction efficiency and target specificit y113. There are currently 12 known serotypes of AAVs with sequence similarity between 50 - 99% that are known to exhibit different but overlapping tropisms80. These tropisms are often attributed to their uptake by specific cell surface receptors. For instance, AAV2 binds to heparin sulfate receptor114 and AAV9 binds to galact ose receptor115. In addition to these major receptors, several have identified co -receptors which contribute to their cellular uptake116,117. While these receptors contribute to some differences in the tropism among serotypes, the se receptors ar e broadly expressed across different tissues. In other words, the AAVs are naturally evolved to have broad tropisms, and this needs to be addressed if we want to use them as safe vehicles for gene delivery to a specific target. In addition to the serotype specific receptors and co -receptors, the AAVs are also known to have a universal receptor AAVR, and this could be crucial for host cell infectivity118-123. Given the presence of multiple receptors and incomplete understanding of the biology, alternate approaches have been taken to tackle the issue on off -target transduction such as by performing localized injection to deliver the cargo124, or cargo engineering to restrict expression to cell populations of interest , or by coupling injection of AAVs carrying transgene that is controlled by a recombinase enzyme such as Cre into Cre -transgenic animals to get specificity in transgene expression93. Having said that, these approaches aren't always feasible and are often very invasive . Alternative strategies t o achieve highly targeted gene delivery and protein expression are desired i n areas that are anatomically hard to access for AAV injection , in cell -types with unknown specific regulatory elements , and in cell -types with lack of availabi lity of cell-type sp ecific transgenic line s. 1.3 ENGINEERING AAV CARGOS FOR EFFICIENT AND TARGETED PROTEIN EXPRESSION AAVs with improved transduction efficiencies and improved cell -type specificity, i.e., with minimal off -target transduction via systemic injection would open up many potential 7 applications in science to begin with and may eventually find their purpose in gene therapies too. These are currently addressed by various modifications done to the cargo or the rAAV genome125-127. To improve transduction efficiency, strong ubiquitous promoters or enhancers have been engineered to fit into the rAAV genome size limit95,128,129. ITRs have also been mutated to engineer to a self -complementary AAV (scAAV) version which can deliver the genome as a double s tranded DNA (dsDNA) instead of a ssDNA but at half the genome size (2.35 kb)130. This scAAV version alleviates the rate limiting step of the second strand synthesis in the host cell, thereby shown to improve the transduction efficiency. To restrict expression of delivered cargo to the cell -types of interest, regulatory elements are engineered to fit the needs. C ell-type specific pro moters or enhancers can regulate expression in a defined cell population129,131,132. Inducible promoters (such as tetracycline inducible promoter) can control the dose or time of expression133. Other regulatory elements such as microRNA targeting signal are identified across cell -types of interest and can selectively suppress expression in a cell type where the recognized miRNA can act on it134-137. While th e cargo engineering is a welcome addition to improve the efficiency and specificity of the vector delivered gene exp ression, these strategies do not completely alleviate the problem when a non -invasive systemic delivery is preferred where the vectors still deliver genes across different organs , thereby turning on the immune response in the host cell138. Also, these regulatory elements can have varying degrees of specificity or efficiency across cell -types. Hence it is only seen as an added advantage to the existing vectors, and not a definitive solution to the problem of broad tropism . 1.4 ENGINEERING AAV CAPSIDS TO MODIFY THE VECTOR TROPISM Engineering AAV capsids to overcome the current limitations has been of great interest to the field. For instance, n euron -specific AAVs will be useful for neural circuit 8 mapping studies139, and the organ specific ones, say heart, lung and kidney, will find broad applications to study pathologies and to develop disease mod els140-142. Broadly, the availabi lity of these specific variants can facilitate non -invasive delivery of vectors , which will simplify the whole procedure involved in gene delivery both in science and in clinics. Several groups have attempted to address this problem using a rational or sem i-rational approach143-148 or directed evolution approach113,149 -153. Progress with the rational design has been slow due to our limited understanding of the capsid structure -function relationship. In light of this, directed evo lution seems to have more promis e for vector engineering because it requires little to no knowledge of a receptor target or mechanism of entry93,154. 1.5 IN VIVO SELECTION OF AAV CAPSIDS USING CREATE Recombinant AAVs are the preferred vehicles for many in vivo gene transfer applications across cell populations ; however, applications involving gene transfer to the central nervous system ( CNS ) are limited due to the lower transduction efficiency and specificity from natural or engineered vectors via systemic delivery across species, and often requires invasive routes of delivery or very high doses of vector93,143,155,156. This is because for intravenous delivery, the highly selective blood -brain barrier (BBB) poses a serious challe nge, and the cellular heterogeneity of the CNS present s further challenges for gene transfer applications. Cre recombination -based AAV targeted evolution method (CREATE) In 2016, Deverman, B., et al157 developed an in vivo selection method to provide selective pressure for capsids that cross the BBB and functionally transduce CNS cell types. This method, called CREATE (Cre-recombination based AAV targeted evolution) is a Cre recombination -dependent approach to selectively r ecover capsids that transduce predefined (rAAV -Cap- in-cis-lox) that couples a full -length AAV cap gene, controlled by regulatory elements from the AAV rep gene with a Cre -invertible switch (Figure 1. 2). By building capsid libraries 9 within the rAAV -Cap-in-cis-lox backbone and delivering the virus libraries to animals with Cre expression in a defined cell population, the system enables the selective amplification and recovery of sequenc es that have t ransduced the target population ( Figure 1. 2)157. Figure 1.2: Cre-dependent recovery of AAV capsid sequences from transduced target cells. (a) An overview of the CREATE selection process. PCR is used to intr oduce diversity (full visual spectrum vertical band) into a capsid gene fragment (yellow). The fragment is cloned into the rAAV genome harboring the remaining capsid gene (gray) and is used to generate a library of virus variants. The library is injected i nto Cre transgenic animals, and PCR is used to selectively recover capsid sequences from inverts polyadenylation the lox71 and lox66 sites. PCR primers (half arrows) are used to selectively amplify Cre -recombined sequences. (c) PCR products from Cre recombination -dependent (top) and -independent (bottom) amplification of capsid library sequences recovered from two Cre+ or Cre mice are shown. Schematics (bottom) show the PCR amplification strategies. (d) Schematic shows the AAV genes within the Rep -AAP AAV helper plasmid and the proteins encoded by the cap gene. Stop codons inserted in the cap gene eliminate VP1, VP2 and VP3 c apsid protein expression.

(f) Cloning 7 -mer capsid library into the rAAV -Cap -in-cis vector. (g) The AAV9 surface model shows the location of the 7 -mer inserted between amino acids (aa) 588 and 589 (magenta). Sites encoded with the PCR -generated library fragment (aa 450 - 592) are s hown in yellow157. Using CREATE, the natural serotype AAV9 that is known to cross the BBB less efficiently was chosen to evolve by targeted inserti on of a randomized 7-mer (7-amino acid long peptide ) within a sed site of the capsid (between AA588 -589) and then intravenously injected this large library (a theoretical library size of ~1.28 billion variants) in a Cre -transgenic mouse where Cre expression was restricted to the CNS cell -type of interest . GFAP -Cre, a n astrocyte specific Cre transgenic line was chosen given the high prevalence of this cell population in the CNS. Two weeks post in vivo selection, the mice were sacrificed to collect the brain and spinal cord. The viral DNA was extracted from the tissue, and selectively amplified the viral DNA from the Cre -positive cells using primers that can selectively yield a PCR product of lox -flipped viral DNA . This was then pooled together to make a second viral library for the second round of selection157. Post two rounds of selection, the recovered variants were cloned back in Escherichia coli, and the highly enriched variants were identified by sanger sequencing. The outcome resulted in a handful of enriched variants , each of whic h had a unique 7 -mer motif . A rAAV capsid variant called AAV -PHP.B d the transgene broadly in CNS and the transduction efficiency was at least 40 -fold higher compared to the parent (Figure s 1.3)157. 11 Figure 1 .3: AAV-PHP.B mediates efficient gene delivery throughout the CNS after intravenous injection in adult mice.

The follow -up work from the Gradinaru lab, by Chan, K., et al133 reported additional AAV variants using CREATE. One new variant AAV -PHP.S provides efficient transduction of sensory neurons and cardiac muscle, and the second reported variant , AAV -PHP.eB , that was further evolved from AAV -PHP.B parent, exhibit s broad CNS tran sduction with higher neuron transduction efficiency compared to AAV -PHP.B. In summary, these studies support the use of CREATE to evolve AAVs that show greater efficiency for the desired nerve cell types. 1.6 RESEARCH MOTIVATION Thesis aim s 1. To expand t he potential use of the engineered PHP vectors through development of a detailed easy -to-follow protocol, and establish strategies to achieve transgene expression in specific cell population through cargo engineering, and study the usage of vectors across mouse strains or species. AAV -PHP.eB or AAV -PHP.B's ability to broadly transduce different cell -types of CNS has been well received by the scientific community for neuroscience applications158- 163. However, as every study involves specific cargos to deliver into the desired cell populations, its usage can be broadened by establishing a detailed and optimized protocol to help scientists produce these vectors in a laboratory setting for their own needs. Further, these engineered vectors can further benefit from strategies to refine the delivered transgene expression in a select population under investigation acros s different host systems . 12 2. To build a high -confidence in vivo selection platform in order to overcome current limitations of existing selection technolog y such as CREATE, and thereby speed up the development of the AAV toolkit to target distinct cell po pulations of the central nervous system via systemic delivery . Developing highly efficient target specific and safe vehicles are ambitious goals to achieve and any significant success in this direction will benefit the scientific and medical communities. Such selective tropism requires an in vivo selection platform where we can perform parallel positive selections across targets of interest , and couple the process with post-hoc negative selections across off -targets. I wou ld like to approach this by buildi ng upon the CREATE method that would allow us to find high performing variants in different mouse nerve cell types by positive and negative selec tion, henceforth referred to Multiplexed - CREATE . The selected capsids could be supplemented with strategies to further refine the expression to the target cell population such as the one described earlier involving cargo engineering . Current limitations with CREATE method The published CREATE system allows us to do positive selection133,157. In other words, we can enrich for improved variants with several rounds of selection. While this is optimal to select for high transduction efficiency, this may not be the best strategy if we want to look for other traits such as selective tropism, functional viruses with no tropism, broad tropisms , etc. Also, the CREATE method does not provide us with an understanding of how the enriched variants performed in every step of the selection. This is very usef ul information for the experimenter to analyze the root cause for enrich ment . Were these variants recovered because they highly transduced the cells of interest, or simply because of some other bias introduced by variabilities in virus production, DNA libr ary assembly , or PCR amplification ? Since we lacked this first -hand knowledge on the performance of variants in the CREATE method, we often do not have much confidence about whic h variants to test individually. 13 Current limitations with the translation of AAV-PHP.B vectors across mouse strains and species The recent works from different laboratories pointed out the limitations with the use of AAV -PHP.B variants across mouse strains. A mouse strain, BALB/cJ , was first identified to lack the enhanced CNS trans duction seen with AAV -PHP.B or eB vectors164. Follow -up studies later noticed that the transduction was not consistent across different strains of mice, and broadly classified mouse strains that had PHP.B permissibility to those that did not165,166. This suggested that the BBB across strains of mice is not conserved. The differences across these strains led to the ide ntification of the endothelial cell membrane protein receptor, ly6a, to be responsible for the AAV -PHP.B or eB uptake by the endothelial cells that forms the BBB165,167,168. This not only limits the use of these vectors across mouse strains but also their ability to translate across species as such the homolog for ly6a is not found in humans. Hence to potentially translate the use of vectors across different strains of mouse and across species, we need to select for new variants that may surpass the current limitations on translation. 14 C h a p t e r 2 CHARACTERIZATION AND PRODUCTION OF SYSTEMIC AAV VECTORS FOR WIDESPR EAD AND TARGETED GENE DELIVERY IN RODENTS Challis, R.

However, a detailed protocol for generating and systemically delivering novel AAV variants was not previously available. In this protocol, we describe how to produce and intravenously administer AAVs to adult mice to specifically label and/or genetically manipulate cells in the nervous system and organs, including the heart. The procedure comprises three separate stages: AAV production, intrave nous delivery, and evaluation of transgene expression. The protocol spans 8 d, excluding the time required to assess gene expression, and can be readily adopted by researchers with basic molecular biology, cell culture, and animal work experience. We provi de guidelines for experimental design and choice of the capsid, cargo, and viral dose appropriate for the experimental aims. The procedures outlined here are adaptable to diverse biomedical applications, from anatomical and functional mapping to gene expre ssion, silencing, and editing. 15 2.2 INTRODUCTION Recombinant AAVs (rAAVs) are commonly used vehicles for in vivo gene transfer and promising vectors for therapeutic applications169. However, AAVs that enable efficient and noninvasive gene delivery to defined cell populations are needed. Current gene delivery methods (e.g., intra -parenchymal surgical injections) are invasive, and alternatives such as intravenous admi nistration require high viral doses and provide relatively inefficient transduction of target cells. We previously developed Cre recombination -based AAV targeted evolution (CREATE) to engineer and screen for AAV capsids that are capable of more efficient g ene transfer to specific cell types via the vasculature133,134,157. Compared to naturally occurring capsids (e.g., AAV9), the novel AAV -PHP capsids identified by CREATE exhibit markedly improved tropism for cells in the adult mouse centr al nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and visceral organs. In this protocol, we describe how to package genetic cargo into AAV -PHP capsids and intravenously administer AAVs for efficient, noninvasive, and targeted gene delivery at sites throughout the body ( Figure 2.1). 16 Figure 2.1: Overview of the protocol. The Procedure comprises three main stages: AAV production (Steps 1 -42), intravenous delivery (Steps 43 -49), and evaluation of transgene 50). The pAAV cont ains the rAAV genome (e.g., containing a fluorescent reporter, shown in green) ( Figure 2.6 and Table 2.T1), which is packaged into an AAV -PHP capsid via triple transient transfection. Systemic administration of AAV -PHP viruses is achieved by retro - orbital injection into wild -type or transgenic mice; transgene expression is evaluated after adequate time has passed for viral transduction and protein expression. AAV -PHP viruses target cells in the CNS (e.g., in the brain and spinal cord) or PNS and visceral or gans (e.g., in the heart and gut). Filled green circles represent transduced cells. For illustrative purposes, we use fluorescent labeling as an example of how to assess transgene expression; however, assessment can take other forms (see ' Experimental desi gn' section for details). See Figure 2.7a for a time line of the Procedure. 17 Among our new capsid variants133,134,157, AAV -PHP.B and the further evolved AAV -PHP.eB efficiently transduce neurons and glia throughout the CNS ( Figure 2.2); another variant, AAV -PHP.S, displays improved tropism for neurons within the PNS (Figure 2.3) and organs, including the gut133 and heart ( Figure 2.4). Importantly, these capsids target cell populations that are n ormally difficult to access because of their location (e.g., sympathetic, nodose, dorsal root, and cardiac ganglia) ( Figures 2.3a-c and 2.4d) or broad distribution (e.g., throughout the brain or enteric nervous system) ( Figures 2.2 and 2.3d) and can be uti lized in several mouse and rat strains ( Figure 2.5). Together with the capsid, the genetic cargo (or rAAV genome) can be customized to control transgene expression ( Figure 2.6 and Table 2.T1). The rAAV genome contains the components required for gene expre ssion, including promoters, transgenes, protein trafficking signals, and recombinase -dependent expression schemes. Hence, different capsid -cargo combinations create a versatile AAV toolbox for genetic manipulation of diverse cell populations in wild -type a nd transgenic animals. Here, we provide researchers, especially those new to working with AAVs or systemic delivery, with resources that will help them utilize AAV -PHP viruses in their own research. 18 Figure 2.2: AAV -PHP.eB and gene regulatory elements ena ble cell type -specific gene expression in the brain. (a-c), We used AAV -PHP.eB to package single -stranded (ss) rAAV genomes that express fluorescent reporters (XFPs), each with two nuclear localization signals (NLS), from cell type-specific promoters. Gen omes containing the hSyn1, MBP, or GFAP (GfABC1D) promoters were used to target neurons, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes, respectively. Viruses were co -delivered by retro -orbital injection to 7 -week -old C57BL/6N mice (n 2) at fluorescence in coronal brain sections was evaluated 4 weeks later using confocal microscopy.

(c), AAV -PHP.eB differentially transduces various regions and cell types throughout the brain. 'Specificity' or 'Efficiency' are defined as the ratio of double - labeled cells to the total number of XFP - or antibody -labeled cells, respectively. For image processing, median filtering and background subtraction using morphological opening were first applied to each image to reduce noise and correct imbalanced illumination. Each nucleus expressing XFPs and labeled with antibodies was then segmented by applying a Laplacian of Gaussian filter to the pre -processed images. We considered cells that were both expressing XFPs and labeled with antibodies if the nearest center -to-center distance between blobs (nuclei or cell bodies) in two channels was <7 \u00b5m (half of the c ell body size). Five images per brain region were analyzed in each mouse; we excluded images with tissue edges because bright edges prevent accurate cell detection. Mean \u00b1 s.e.m. is shown. (d,e), miRNA target sequences (TS) miR -204-5p or miR -708-5p135 can be used to achieve expression that is more restricted to neurons or astrocytes, respectively.

The rAAV genome, contained in a pAAV plasmid (not shown), consists of an expression cassette flanked by two 145 -bp inverted terminal repeats (ITRs); the entire genome, including the ITRs, cannot exceed 4.7 -5 kb. The promoters, transgenes, localization signals, and recombination schemes are interchangeable. Gene regulatory elements, such as promote rs and microRNA (miRNA) target sequences (TS) ( Figure specificity transgene expression125. Transgenes may be constitutively expressed or flanke d by recombination sites for flippase (Flp) - or Cre recombinase (Cre) - dependent expression. In the latter approach, the transgene remains in the double -floxed inverted orientation (DIO); Cre -mediated inversion of the transgene enables cell type - specific ex pression in transgenic animals ( Figures 2.3a-c and Figures 2. 4c,d). Localization sequences further restrict gene expression to distinct cellular compartments such as the nucleus (via one or more nuclear localization signals (NLS)) ( Figure 2.2a,b), cytosol (via a nuclear exclusion signal (NES)174), or cell membrane (via farnesylation175, 25 the CD4 -2176 transmembrane (TM) targeting domain, or PDZ177 protein -protein interaction domains) ( Figure 2.3d). Note that the 3 UTR contains the woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) (609 bp) and a polyadenylation signal (e.g., the human growth hormone (hGH) polyA) (479 bp) (not shown), both of which enhance transgene125. We recommend that foreign genes be codon -optimized to match the host species to increase expression from the rAAV genome. Use sequence -editing and annotation software to determine the unique att ributes of each rAAV genome. In Table 2.T1, we list genomes used here and in our previous work133,157; see also Addgene's plasmid repository for pAAVs that may be suitable for differ ent applications. CRISPR, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; DREADDs, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.

The procedure includes thre e main stages ( Figure 2.1): AAV production (Steps 1 -42), intravenous delivery (Steps 43 -49), and evaluation of transgene expression (Step 50). The AAV production protocol is adapted from established methods. First, HEK293T cells are transfected with three plasmids178-180 (Steps 1 -3, Figure 2.1 and Figure 2. 7): (i) pAAV, which contains the rAAV genome of interest Figure and Table 2.T1); (ii) pUCmini -iCAP -PHP, which encodes the viral capsid proteins ( Table 2.T2); and (iii) pHelper, which encode s adenoviral proteins necessary for replication. Using this triple -transfection approach, a single -stranded rAAV genome is packaged into an AAV - PHP capsid in HEK293T cells. AAV -PHP viruses are then harvested181 (Steps 4 -14), purified182,183 -31), quantit ative PCR (Steps 32 -42) (Figure 2.7). Purified are intravenously delivered to mice via retro -orbital injection185 (Steps 43 -49), and gene expression is later assessed using molecular, histological, or functional methods relevant to the experimental aims (Step 50). 28 Figure 2.7: Time line and AAV harvest procedure. (a), Time line of the procedure. The entire protocol spans 8 d, excluding pause points on days 5 (Steps 1 1 and 14), 6 (Step 31), and 7 (Step 35) and the time required to evaluate transgene expression (Step 50). Days 1 -7 (Steps 1-42) constitute the AAV production stage ( Figure 2.1). (b), Schematic of the AAV harvest procedure, with images corresponding to indi cated steps. The iodixanol -based purification protocol does not eliminate empty capsids (i.e., capsids that fail to package an rAAV genome), as determined by negative -staining transmission electron microscopy; empty particles are characterized by an electr on-dense core. Scale bar, 50 nm. Gray arrows and text denote steps at which the supernatant and pellet can be bleached and discarded (Steps 13 and 18). 29 AAV - PHP capsid Plasmid name In vivo characteristics Production -TRE-based inducibl e amplification loop to increase virus production. If the rAAV genome has a tetracycline -regulated element (e.g., TRE), the tTA on the capsid plasmid will drive a high level of expression from the TRE - containing rAAV genome, which may reduce virus producti on. To increase viral yields, increase the number of dishes per viral prep. aGiven the poor production efficiency of AAV - PHP.A, and its tendency to aggregate after purification, we suggest using AAV -PHP.eB to target astrocytes. Use an astrocyte promoter, s uch as GFAP, to drive transgene expression (Figure 2.2a -c). To request AAV -PHP.A (listed CLOVER inducible cap expression; pUCmini, pUC origin of replication. This protocol is optimized to produce AAVs at high titer (1 with high tra nsduction efficiency in vivo133,157. 30 Applications of the method We anticipate that AAV -PHP capsids ( Table 2.T2) can be used to package rAAV genomes (contained in pAAV plasmids that are available through Addgene and elsewhere) (Figure 2. 6 and Table 2.T1) to enable a wide range of biomedical applications. Below, we highlight current and potential applications of this method. Anatomical mapping Fluorescent reporters are commonly used for cell type -specific mapping and phenotyping133,186,187 (Figures 2.2-2.5). AAV -mediated multi color labeling (e.g., Brainbow188) is especially advantageous for anatomical mapping approaches that require individual cells in the same population to be distinguished from one another. We and ot hers have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in the brain133,188 retina188, heart ( Figure 2.4b,c), and gut133, the peripheral ganglia ( Figure 2.3c). Spectrally distinct labeling is well -suited for studying the organization of cells (e.g., cardiomyocytes ( Figure 2.4b)) in heal thy and diseased tissues and long -range tract tracing of individual fibers through extensive neural networks (e.g., the enteric133 or cardiac nervous systems ( Figure 2.4c)). Functional mapping AAV -PHP capsids are also relevant for probing cell function. AAV -PHP.B was previously used to target distinct neural circuits throughout the brain for chemogenetic158,189 and optical imaging applications190,191. We predict that AAV -PHP viruses will be beneficial for manipulating neural networks that are typically difficult to access, such as peripheral circuits controlling the heart ( Figure 2.4d), lungs192, or gut193. AAV -PHP variants could also be utilized to interrogate the function of non -neuronal cell types, including cardiomyocytes194, pancreatic beta cells195,196, and hepatocytes197. Harnessing AAV -PHP viruses to modulate cell physiology may reveal novel roles for different cells in regulating organ function and/or animal behavior198. 31 Gene expression, silencing, and editing AAV -PHP viruses can be used to test potential therapeutic strategies that would benefit from organ wide or systemic transgene expression199. Recently, AAV -PHP.B was used to treat158 and model159 neurodegenerative diseases with widespread pathology. Other potential applications include gene editing (e.g., via CRISPR161,200 -202) or silencing (e.g., via shRNA203); importantly, these approaches could be utilized to broadly and noninvasively manipulate cells in both healthy and diseased states for either basic research or therapeutically motivated studies. AAV capsid engineering AAV -PHP capsids can be further evo lved for more efficient transduction of specific organs and cell types throughout the body. This protocol can be used for AAV engineering applications (e.g., our in vivo capsid selection method CREATE133,157). Using a modified transfection protocol (Steps 1 -3 and online methods in ref.157), DNA libraries (generated by diversification of the AAV cap gene) are packaged to produce AAV capsid libraries, which are then harvested (Steps 4 -14 and online methods in ref.157), purified (Steps 15 - 31), and titered (Steps 32 -42). Libraries are systemically administered to Cre transgenic animals (Steps 43 -49) or wild -type animals in w hich Cre is introduced (e.g., by AAV delivery), and Cre -dependent cap recovery from tissues of interest facilitates further rounds of selection to isolate enriched variants. This protocol can also be used to characterize novel serotypes identified with CRE ATE or other engineering methods204. Limitations of the method A major limitation of AAV capsids, including AAV -PHP variants, is their relatively small packaging capacity (<5 kb) . Some elements of the rAAV genome, such as the woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), can be truncated127 or removed126,205 to accommodate larger genetic components. The development of smaller promoters128,129 and dual expression systems206, in which genetic elements are split between 32 two or more viruses (requiring efficient co-transduction), has also enabled the delivery of larger genomes. Continued development of these approaches will help bypass restrictions on rAAV genome size. Intravenous administration of AAVs also presents unique challenges. For example, systemic transd uction may be undesirable for applications in which highly restricted gene expression is vital to the experimental outcome. Possible off -target transduction, due to the broad tropism of AAV -PHP variants and/or lack of compatible cell type-specific promoter s, can be reduced by miRNA -mediated gene silencing. Sequences complementary to miRNAs expressed in off -target cell populations can be introduced into the 3 UTR of the rAAV genome ( Figure 2.6); this has been shown to reduce off -target transgene expression and better restrict expression to cell types of interest137,207 (Figure 2.2d,e). Another challenge of systemic delivery is that it requires a high viral load, which can elicit an immune response against the capsid and/or transgene and reduce transduction efficiency in vivo208. Immunogenicity of AAVs may be exacerbated by em pty capsid contamination in viral preparations209,210. The viral purification protocol (Steps 15 -31) reduces, but does not eliminate, empty capsids ( Figure 2.7b). If this poses a concern for specific applications, viruses can be purified using an alternative app roach181,182,211. The generat ion of viruses for systemic administration may impose a financial burden on laboratories due to the doses of virus required. Nevertheless, viral -mediated gene delivery is inexpensive compared to creating and maintaining transgenic animals. Moreover, intrav enous injection is faster, less invasive, and less technically demanding than other routes of AAV administration, such as stereotaxic injection, thereby eliminating the need for specialized equipment and survival surgery training. Experimental design Before proceeding with the protocol, a number of factors should be considered, namely the expertise and resources available in the lab; the animal model, capsid, and rAAV genome to be used; the dose for intravenous administration; and the method(s) available for assessing transgene expression. Each of these topics is discussed below to guide users in designing their experiments. 33 Required expertise and resources This protocol requires that the scientists have basic molecular biology, cell culture, and animal work experience. Users should be approved to handle laboratory animals, human cell lines, and AAVs. A background in molecular cloning is advantageous, although not necessary if relying on available plasmids. In addition to having the above expertise, the l abs must be equipped for the molecular and cell culture work relevant to the procedure; we suggest that users read through the entire ' Materials ' and ' Procedure ' sections beforehand to ensure that the required reagents and equipment are available and appro priate safety practices and institutional approvals are in place. Animal model This protocol describes the production of AAVs for intravenous delivery to 6 - to 8- week -old male and female mice. AAV -PHP viruses have been validated in C57BL/6J mice133,157,158,160 (Figures 2.2-2.5) and numerous Cre driver lines133,158,189,190, including, but not limited to, TH -IRES -Cre ( Figure 2.3), TRPV1 -IRESCre ChAT -IRES mice133 (Figure 2.4). Intriguingly, AAV -PHP.B demonstrates low throughout the brain when systemically administered to BALB/cJ mice164 (Figure 2.5a). However, the neurotropic properties of AAV -PHP.B are not limited to the C57BL/6J strain in which they were selected. AAV -PHP.B transduces the brain more efficiently than AAV9 in both FVB/NCrl and 129S1/SvImJ mice ( Figure 2.5a). We also show mples AAV transducing in and Figure 2.5b), as well as Fischer ( Figure 2.5c) and Long Evans rats ( Figure 2.5d). Compared to AAV9 and AAV -PHP.B, AAV -PHP.eB results in more efficient neuronal tr ansduction in Sprague -Dawley rats after either intravenous administration or intra -parenchymal stereotaxic injections159,162. We predict that AAV - PHP capsids can be used in multiple species and strains for diverse applications, such as those requiring fluorescent labeling ( Figure 2.5a-c) and calcium imaging ( Figure 2.5d,e). We have not compared the transduction efficiencies of AAV9 and AAV -PHP capsids across all rodent strains and species or determined the optimal dose for transducing specific 34 organs and cell types in different animal models. Users should test these parameter s to determine the utility of AAV -PHP variants in their research. See ' Reagents ' for mouse and rat catalog numbers. Selecting an AAV -PHP capsid We recommend choosing an AAV -PHP capsid ( Table 2.T2) based on its tropism and production efficiency. Capsid pr operties are listed in Supplementary Table 2.ST 1; we include species, organs, and cell populations examined to date and note typical viral yields. We anticipate that most researchers will use AAV -PHP.eB (Addgene, plasmid no. 103005) or AAV in their experiments. AAV -PHP.eB and AAV -PHP.S produce viral yields similar to those of other high -producing naturally occurring serotypes (e.g., AAV9) and enable efficient, noninvasive gene transfer to the CNS or PNS and visceral organ s, respectively133 (Figures provide transduction, either produc e suboptimal yields (AAV -PHP.A)157 or have since been f urther evolved for enhanced transduction efficiency in vivo (AAV -PHP.B (Addgene, plasmid no. 103002))133. We therefore recommend using AAV -PHP.eB for CNS applications, especially when targeting neurons. Note, ho wever, that the chosen capsid will ultimately depend on the experimental circumstances; multiple factors, including species212, strain164 (Figure 2.5), age213, gender214, and health215, can influence AAV tropism. Testing the AAV -PHP variants in a variety of experimental paradigms will contin ue to reveal the unique attributes of each capsid and identify those most suitable for different applications. Selecting an rAAV genome Users must select an rAAV genome, contained in a pAAV plasmid, to package into the capsid ( Figures 2.1 and 2.6; Table 2.T1). In Table 2.T1, we list the pAAVs used here (Figures 2.2-2.4) and in our previous work133,157; we direct users to Addgene's plasmid repository for additional pAAVs developed fo r various applications. Depending on the experimental aims, users can elect to design their own genomes125 and clone from existing 35 pAAVs. When customizing plasmids, it is imperative that the rAAV genome, the sequence between and including the two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), does not exceed 4.7-5 kb ( Figure 2.6); larger genomes will not be fully packaged into AAV capsids, resulting in truncated genomes and low titers. The ITRs ar e 145 -bp sequences that flank the expression cassette and are required for replication and encapsidation of the viral genome. ITRs are typically derived from the AAV2 genome and must match the serotype of the rep contained in the capsid plasmid; pUCmi ni-iCAP -PHP plasmids contain the AAV2 rep are therefore capable of packaging genomes with AAV2 ITRs (i.e., almost any pAAV available from Addgene). Other genetic components (e.g., promoters, transgenes, localization signals, and recombination sche mes) are interchangeable and can be customized for specific applications ( Figure 2.6). Dosage for intravenous administration The optimal dose for intravenous administration to target cell populations must be determined empirically. We encourage users to refer to Figures 2.2-2.5 and related work for suggested AAV -PHP viral doses. AAV -PHP variants have been successfully administered to adult mice133,157,158,160 (Figures neonatal mice158, 2.5c,d) for fluorescent labeling; they have also been used for calcium imaging190,191 and optogenetic (Figure 2.4d), chemogenetic158,189, and therapeutic applications158,159. We 1 \u00d7 1011 and 5 \u00d7 1011 vg of AAV and 1 \u00d7 1012 vg of AAV -PHP.S to adult mice (6 -8 weeks old). However, dosage will vary depending on the target cell population, desired fraction of transduced cells, an d expression level per cell. AAVs independently and stochastically transduce cells, typically resulting in m ultiple genome copies per cell133. Therefore, higher doses generally result in strong expression (i.e., high copy number) in a large fraction of cells, whereas lower doses result in weaker expression (i.e., low copy number) in a smaller fraction of cells. To achieve high expression in a sparse subset of cells, users can employ a two -component system in whic h transgene expression is dependent on co -transduction of an inducer (e.g., a vector expressing the tetracycline -controlled 36 transactivator (tTA)133); inducers are injected at a lower dose (typically 1 \u00d7 109 to 1 \u00d7 1011 vg) to limit the fraction of cells with transgene expression. No te that transgenes and gene regulatory elements (e.g., enhancers, promoters, and miRNA target sequences (Figure 2.2d,e)) can influence gene expression levels. Therefore, users should assess transgene expression from a series of doses and at several time po ints after intravenous delivery to determine the optimal experimental conditions. Evaluation of transgene expression Following in vivo delivery, AAV transduction and transgene expression increase over the course of several weeks. Although expression is e vident within days after transduction, it does not reach a steady -state level until at least 3 -4 weeks after transduction. Therefore, we suggest waiting for a minimum of 2 weeks before evaluating fluorescent labeling133,157 -159 (Figures 2.2-2.5) and at least 3 -4 before beginning optogenetic (Figure 2.4d), chemogenetic158,189, and calcium imaging190,191 experiments. Note that, li ke other AAVs, AAV -PHP variants are capable of providing long -term transgene expression. AAV -PHP.B -mediated cortical expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s, was reported to last at least 10 weeks post -injection without toxic side ef fects191 (i.e., nuclear filling217), and we have observed GFP expression throughout the brain >1 year after viral administration (see Supplementary Fig ure 4 in ref.157 ). However, the time points suggested here are only meant to serve as guidelines; gene expression is contingent on multiple factors, including the animal model, capsid, genome, and dose. The appropriate method(s) for evaluating transgene expression will vary among users and may include functional (e.g., optical imaging217), histological218 (e.g., using endogenous fluorescence, antibodies, or molecular probes), or molecular (e.g., Western blot219 or qPCR133) approaches220. To assess transduction efficiency across different organs, users can perform a qPCR -based vector biodistribution assay, in which vector genomes are quantified and normalized to the mouse genome (e.g., a housekeeping gene)157. Other approaches typically involve examining fluorescent protein expression in thin or thick (100 \u00b5m) tissue samples. The CLARITY -based methods such as passive 37 CLARITY t echnique (PACT) and perfusion -assisted agent release in situ (PARS)171 render thick tissues optically transparent while preserving their three -dimensional molecular and cellular architecture, and facil itate deep imaging of large volumes (e.g., using confocal or light -sheet microscopy)221-223. Cleared tissues are compatible wi th endogenous fluorophores, including commonly used markers such as GFP157,171,21 8, eYFP171, and tdTomato218. However, some fluorescent signals, such as those from mTurquoise133, mNeonGreen, and mRuby 2, can deteriorate in chemical clearing reagents. To visualize these reporters, we suggest using optical clearing reagents such as refractive index -matching solution 2.3a,c,d, 2.4b-d, and 2.5e) or commercia lly available mounting media (Step 50) (Figure 2.5a,c). Some fluorescent proteins are sensitive to photobleaching. For example, mRuby2 may bleach over long imaging sessions or at high magnification; tdTomato exhibits similar spectral properties and may be a more suitable alternative, given its photostability224. Also, note that auto - fluorescent lipofuscin accumulates in aging post -mitotic tissues (e.g., the brain and heart)225 and may interfere with examination of transduced cells; in this case, either reduce auto - fluorescence using histological methods218,226 or, if possible, inject younger adults (8 weeks old) and determine the minimum time required for transgene expression. 2.3 MATERIALS Biological materials Caution: To address the issue of cell line misidentification an d cross -contamination, it is recommended that cell lines be regularly checked to ensure they are authentic and are not infected with mycoplasma.

Glassware is not endotoxin -free, and autoclaving does not eliminate endotoxins. To minimize contamination, we dissolve chemicals in sterile bottles by shaking and/or heating to mix, use demarcations on bottles to bring solutions to the final volume, and use pH strips rather than a pH meter. When filter -sterilizing so lutions, do so in a biosafety cabinet. Plasmid DNA Grow bacterial stocks in LB or Plasmid+ media containing the appropriate selective antibiotic; refer to the Addgene catalog for suggested growth conditions. Use a large -scale endotoxin -free plasmid purif ication kit with the supplied Tris -EDTA (TE) buffer. Measure the DNA purity and concentration using a spectrophotometer and freeze at 20 \u00b0C or 80 \u00b0C for up to several y ears. Critical: Always verify the integrity of purified plasmids by Sanger sequencing (using a DNA sequencing facility) and restriction digestion (https://www.neb.com/tools -a nd - resources) before proceeding with downstream applications. pAAV plasmids contain ITRs (Figure 2.6) that are prone to recombi nation in E. coli. pAAVs should be propagated in recombination -deficient strains such as NEB Stable, Stbl3, or SURE 2 competent cells to prevent unwanted recombination. After purification, pAAVs should be digested with SmaI to confirm the presence of ITRs, which are required for replication and encapsidation of the viral genome; use sequence -editing and annotation software to determine the expected band sizes. Note that it is difficult to sequence through the secondary structure of ITRs227; avoid ITRs when designing sequencing primers. Critical: Create bacterial glycerol stocks and store at -80 \u00b0C for up to several years. 52 Cell culture media Add 25 ml of FBS, 5 ml of NEAA, and 5 ml of pen -strep to a 500 -ml bottle of DMEM. Invert to mix and store at 4 \u00b0C for up to several months; warm to 37 \u00b0C before use. The resulting cell culture media should have a final concentration of 5% (vol/vol) FBS, 1\u00d7 NEAA, and 50 U/ml pen To quickly expand cells for large viral preps, consider using a final concentration of 10% (vol/vol) FBS in the cell culture media; see guidelines on cell culture below. Cell culture Thaw HEK293T cells according to the manufacturer's reco mmendations. Passage cells using either TrypLE Express enzyme or a standard trypsinization protocol for adherent cultures228. Seed cells in 150 -mm tissue culture dishes with a final volume of 20 ml of media per dish. Maintain in a cell culture i ncubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Critical: We suggest passaging cells at a ratio of 1:3 (i.e., divide one dish of cells into three new dishes of cells) every other day when expanding cells for viral production; split cells at a 1:2 ratio (or 6 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2) 24 h before t ransfection. Use higher split ratios if using 10% (vol/vol) FBS. Always use sterile technique. Critical: Follow the manufacterer's recommendations to create frozen stocks of HEK cells. PEI stock solution Pipette 50 ml of WFI water into a 50 -ml conical c entrifuge tube for later use. Add 323 mg of PEI to the remaining 950 ml bottle of WFI water and adjust the pH to 2 -3 by adding 1 N HCl suitable for cell culture, keeping track of the volume of HCl added. Heat in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for several hours (or ove rnight) and occasionally shake to mix. Once dissolved, add reserved WFI water to a total volume of 1 liter. Filter -sterilize, make aliquots 53 in 50 -ml conical centrifuge tubes, and store at 20 \u00b0C for up to 1 year. We routinely freeze -thaw our PEI aliquots. Critical: Both our PEI stock solution recipe and PEI calculations ( Supplementary Table 2.ST 2, 'Detailed calculations ' sheet) are based on ref.178. We adjust the pH to 2 -3 so that PEI dissolves in water. The designated pH range does not appear to adversely affect cell viability, t ransfection efficiency, or viral titers. The transfection solution, created by mixing the PEI + DPBS master mix and DNA + DPBS solution (Step 2 and Supplementary Table 2.ST 2), has a final pH of 6.5 -7.0. To transfect one dish, 2 ml of transfection solution is added to 20 ml of media (Step 2), which further dilutes the PEI. PEI + DPBS master mix Thaw PEI in a 37 \u00b0C water bath. Bring the PEI to room temperature (RT; 23 \u00b0C) and vortex to mix. Add PEI and DPBS to a 50 -ml conical centrifuge tube and vortex agai n to mix. Use Supplementary Table 2.ST 2 ('Transfection calculator ' sheet) to calculate the volumes of PEI (cell I9) and DPBS (cell J9) needed. Critical: Prepare fresh master mix before use. DNA + DPBS Bring plasmid DNA to RT and briefly vortex to mix. F or each viral prep, add DNA and DPBS to a 50 -ml conical centrifuge tube; the solution is vortexed in Step 2. Use Supplementary Table 2.ST 2 ('Transfection calculator ' sheet) to calculate the quantities of DNA (e.g., cells E9, E11, and E13) an d DPBS (e.g., c ell F9) needed. Critical: Prepare fresh DNA + DPBS solution before use. Re -measure plasmid DNA concentrations immediately before use; multiple freeze -thaw cycles may cause DNA degradation. 54 SAN digestion buffer Add 29.22 g of NaCl, 4.85 g of Tris base, and 2.03 g of MgCl2\u00b76H2O to a 1 -liter bottle of WFI water and shake to mix. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The resulting SAN digestion buffer should have a final pH of ~10.0 and a final concentration of 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris b ase, and 10 mM MgCl2. SAN + SAN digestion buffer Add 100 U of SAN (4 \u00b5l of 25 U/\u00b5l SAN) per milliliter of SAN digestion buffer; pipette to mix. Critical: Prepare fresh solution before use. 40% (wt/vol) PEG stock solution Decant ~500 ml of WFI water in to a 500 -ml sterile bottle for later use. Add 146.1 g of NaCl to the remaining 500 ml (in the 1 -liter bottle of WFI water) and shake/heat until dissolved. Once completely dissolved, add 400 g of PEG and heat at 37 \u00b0C overnight for up to 2 nights. Add reser ved WFI water to a total volume of 1 liter. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The resulting stock solution should have a final concentration of 2.5 M NaCl and 40% (wt/ vol) PEG. Critical: Prepare in advance. To expedite the procedu re, heat the solution at 65 \u00b0C until the PEG is dissolved. The solution will appear turbid, but no flecks of PEG should remain; the mixture w ill become clear upon cooling. Critical: Pre-wet the entire filter surface with a minimal volume of water before a dding the solution. This solution is extremely viscous and will take 1 -2 h to filter. 55 DPBS + high salt Add 29.22 g of NaCl, 93.2 mg of KCl, and 101.7 mg of MgCl2\u00b76H2O to a 500 -ml bottle of DPBS and shake to mix. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The resulting buffer should have a final concentration of 1 M NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 (in addition to the salts in the DPBS). DPBS + low salt Add 2.92 g of NaCl, 93.2 mg of KCl, and 101.7 mg of MgCl2\u00b76H2O to a 500 -ml bottle of DPBS and shake to mix. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The resulting buffer should have a final concentration of 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 (in addition to the salts in the DPBS). Iodixanol (OptiPrep), DPBS + high salt or DPBS + low salt, and phenol red (if applicable) to a 50 -ml conical centrifuge tube. Invert or briefly vortex to mix. Use Supplementary Table 2.ST 3 to determine the volumes of each reagent needed. The 25% and 60% layers contain phenol red, which turns the solutions red and yellow, respectively, and facilitates clear demarcation of the gradient boundaries ( Figure 2.8). Critical: Prepare fresh solution s on the day of AAV purification. Alternatively, prepare up to 1 d in advance; store at RT and protect from light. Do not pour the density gradients until Step 16. Critical: In Step 16B, prepare more iodixanol solutions than are needed. For six or fewer gradients, prepare enough of each solution to pour an extra gradient. For eight gradients, prepare enough of each solution to pour two extra gradients. The extra solution is needed to fill the 5 -ml pipette and prevent an air bubble from disturbing the gradi ent when releasing the last of the required volume. 56 DNase digestion buffer Use a 50 -ml serological pipette to measure 247.5 ml of UltraPure water into a 250 - ml sterile bottle. Add 55.5 mg of CaCl2, 2.5 ml of 1 M Tris -HCl, and 508 mg of MgCl2\u00b76H2O and sha ke to mix. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The resulting buffer should have a final concentration of 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris -HCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. DNase I + DNase digestion buffer Add 50 U of DNase I per milliliter of digestion buffer (a 1:200 dilution of 1 0 U/\u00b5l DNase); pipette to mix. Critical: Prepare fresh solution before use. Proteinase K solution Use a 50 -ml serological pipette to measure 250 ml of UltraPure water into a 250 -ml sterile bottle. Add 14.61 g of NaCl and sha ke to mix. Add 2.5 g of N -lauroylsarcosine sodium salt to the mixture and gently swirl to mix; N -lauroylsarcosine sodium salt is a surfactant and will generate bubbles during vigorous mixing. Filter -sterilize and store at RT for up to several months. The r esulting solution should have a final concentration of 1 M NaCl and 1% (wt/vol) N -lauroylsarcosine sodium salt. Proteinase K + proteinase K solution Add 100 \u00b5g of proteinase K per milliliter of solution (a proteina se K); pipette to mix. Critical: Prepare fresh solution before use. 57 DNA standard stock Set up a single 50 -\u00b5l restriction digest reaction; use 60 -80 U (3 -4 \u00b5l) of ScaI (or another suitable enzyme) to linearize 20 \u00b5g of the plasmid DNA containing the target sequence. Run a small amount of the reaction on an agarose gel to ensure complete digestion. Purify the reaction using two DNA clean -up columns. Measure the DNA concentration (ng/\u00b5l) using a spectrophotometer. Dilute to ~5 -10 \u00d7 109 -stranded (ss) DNA molecules/\u00b5l and use the Qubit assay to verify the Divide into 20-\u00b5l aliquots in DNA/RNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes and free ze at 20 \u00b0C for up to 1 year. Critical: Before preparing the standard, use sequence -editing and annotation software to confirm that the plasmid contains a single ScaI site in t he ampicillin resistance gene. Critical: Refer to ref.184 and use Supplementary Table 2.ST 4 (cells B7 -10) to calculate the number of ssDNA molecules in a given plasmid (cell B13). We typically use linearized pAAV -CAG -eYFP ng/\u00b5l, which 109 ssDNA molecules/\u00b5l (Supplementary T able 2.ST 4, 'Example ' sheet). DNA standard dilutions Prepare three sets of eight (1:10) serial dilutions of the DNA standard stock. For each set, begin by pipetting 5 \u00b5l of the standard into 45 \u00b5l of UltraPure water (standard no. 8). Mix by vortexing for 3 s and proceed with the seven remaining dilutions (standard no. 7 to standard no. 1). The final concentrations of the standard dilutions should range from 5 -10 \u00d7 108 (standard no. 8) to 5 -10 \u00d7 101 (stand ard no. 1) ssDNA molecules/\u00b5l. Critical: Prepare f resh solutions in DNA/RNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes immediately prior to use; at low concentrations, the linearized DNA is prone to degradation and/or sticking to the walls of the tube184. One 20 -\u00b5l aliquot of the DNA standard stock will provide enough DNA for preparing the dilutions and verifying the concentration via the Qubit assay before qPCR. 58 qPCR master mix Prepare a qPCR master mix for the total number of reactions (i.e., wells) needed. One reaction requires 12.5 \u00b5l of SYBR Green master mix, 9.5 \u00b5l of UltraPure water, and 0.5 \u00b5l of each primer (from a 2.5 -\u00b5M stock concentration), for a total of 23 \u00b5l/well. Pipette or vortex for 1 -2 s to mix. Critical: Prepare fresh solution before use. Equipment setup Clamp setup for AAV purification Attach the rod to the support stand. Secure the clamp 25 -30 cm above the stand (Figure 2.8f). Anesthesia system Place the induction chamber, nose cone, and waste gas scavenging system (e.g., activated charcoal adsorption filters) inside a biosafety cabinet. We recommend using an anesthesia system in which the isoflurane vaporizer and oxygen supply remain outside of the cabinet workspace. Connect the associated tubing such that the input is from the vaporizer/oxygen supply and the output is to the charcoal scavenging device229. 2.4 PROCEDURE Caution: AAVs are biohazardous materials and must be handled according to governmental and institutional regulations. Experiments involving AAVs were performed using biosafety level 2 practice s as required by the California Institute of Technology and the US Centers for D isease Control and Prevention. Critical: The entire procedure spans 8 d, excluding pause points and the time required to evaluate transgene expression (Figure 2.7a). There are no pause points between days 1 and 59 5, until Step 11; once cells have been transfected, AAVs are harvested on days 3 and 5. Plan accordingly during this time window. Triple transient transfection of HEK293T cells Timing 1 -2 h Critical: For capsids that package well (i.e., AAV9, AAV -PHP.B, AAV -PHP.eB, and AAV -PHP.S), the PEI transfection protocol typically yields 1 \u00d7 1012 vg per 150 -mm dish, as measured post purification133,157. Before starting the protocol, determine the number of dishes needed per viral prep and use Supplementary Table 2.ST 2 ('Transfection calculator ' sheet) to calculate the quantities of PEI, DPBS, and plasmid DNA requir ed for transfection. Skip to Step 43 if custom AAVs were obtained elsewhere. 1. 24 h before transfection, seed HEK293T cells in 150 -mm dishes to attain 80 -90% confluency the next day228. Incubate the cells in a cell culture incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. 2. At the time of transfection, make the PEI + DPBS master mix and the DNA + DPBS solution for each viral prep ( Reagent setup and Supplementary Table 2.ST 2, 'Transfection calculator ' sheet). Using a 5 - or 10 -ml serological pipette, add the required volume of the PEI + DPBS master mix (e.g., ' Transfection calculator ' cell G9) dropwise to the DNA + DPBS solution (e.g., ' Transfection calculator ' cells E9 + E11 + E13 + F9) while gently vortexing to mix. Cap the tube and thoroughly vortex for 10 s to mix. Allow the mixture to sit at RT for 2 -10 min. Add 2 ml of the transfection solution dropwise to each dish and swirl to mix before returning the dishes to the cell culture incub ator. Critical step: We use a ratio of 1:4:2 based on micrograms of DNA. We use 40 \u00b5g of total DNA per 150 -mm dish (5.7 \u00b5g of pAAV, 22.8 2.ST 2, 'Detailed calculations ' sheet). The plasmid ratio was optimized during the initial development of the AAV production protocol; 1:4 :2 gave the best viral yields. 60 Critical step: The transfection solution will appear slightly cloudy because of the formation of DNA -PEI complexes178,179. Allowing the mixture to sit for >10 min may reduce transfection efficiency. Critical step: Users can opt to run a positive transfection/virus production control (e.g., pAAV -CAG -eYFP); this is especially important if using an untested rAAV g enome. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 3. Chan ge the media 12 -24 h post transfection by aspirating the old media in 10% (vol/vol) bleach and replacing it with 20 ml of fresh, warmed media ( Reagent setup ). Critical step: Do not allow the cells to remain without media for more than a few minutes. To pr otect the cells from unwanted stress, aspirate the media from five plates at a time and promptly replace it with new media. PEI is moderately cytotoxic179 and cell death of up to 20% is common230. Do not allow the media to remain unchanged for more than 24 h post transfection. Failure to change the media in a timely manner will result in poor cell health and low titers. Critical step: Beginning 72 h post transfection, examine the cell s under a fluorescence microscope to assess fluorescent protein expression, if applicable. Note that expression of the rAAV genome does not necessarily correlate with final viral yield and will depend on the reporter and/or promoter under investigation. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. AAV harvest Timing 5 d Caution: rAAVs, although replication -incompetent, are potent gene -delivery vehicles and must be handled according to governmental and institutional regulations. The safety of packaged transgenes (e.g., oncogenic genes) should be carefully considered. Perform all 61 procedures in a certified biosafety cabinet and clean AAV -contaminated equipment, surfaces, and labware wi th fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach. Critical: Carefully label all tubes and replace gloves, pipettes, and cell scrapers between viral preps to avoid cross -contamination. Refer to Figure 2.7b for a schematic of the AAV harvest procedure. 4. Harvest the cell culture media 72 h (3 d) post transfection. Tilt each dish at a 30\u00b0 angl e and use a 25 -ml serological pipette to collect the media. Store in an empty, sterile media bottle or sterile 500 -ml bottle at 4 \u00b0C until Step 6. Replace the media with 20 ml of fresh, warmed media ( Reagent setup ). Caution: Tilt dishes away from the fron t grill of the biosafety cabinet to prevent media from spilling out of the biosafety cabinet. Critical Step: To avoid cross -contamination, harvest the media from one viral prep at a time. Critical Step: For AAV -PHP production in HEK293T cells, the media at 72 h post transfection contains ~2 \u00d7 1011 vg per dish, or 10 -20% of the expected viral yield. Failure to collect and change media at this ti me point will decrease yields. Critical Step: If time is limited, media and cells can be harvested together at 7 2 h or 96 h rather than 120 h (Step 5), but total yields will be reduced. 5. Harvest the media and cells 120 h (5 d) post -transfection. Use a cell scraper to gently scrape the cells in the media. After scraping the first dish, prop it at a 30\u00b0 angle, usi ng an empty 1.5 -ml microcentrifuge tube rack for support. Scrape down the residual cells and media such that they are pooled together. Return the dish lid and scrape the next plate; prop dishes up against one another along the length of the biosafety cabin et until scraping is complete. Use a 25 -ml serological pipette to collect the media and cells from each dish; 62 transfer to a 250 -ml conical centrifuge tube. Pool the media and cells from up to 10 dishes in a single tube. Caution: Scrape the cells with a fo rward motion (i.e., away from the front grill of the biosafety cabinet) to prevent media and cells from splashing out of the biosafety cabinet. If a spill does occur at this or any other step, immediately cover with paper towels and carefully saturate the towels wi th fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach. Critical Step: To avoid cross -contamination, harvest the media and cells from one viral prep at a time. Critical Step: For larger viral preps (6 -10 dishes), a 250 - or 500 -ml conical centrifuge tube can be used to h arvest the media and cells (Steps 5 -9). However, we recommend using two 250-ml tubes in Step 10B because the PEG pellet (Step 12) is difficult to remove from the walls and edges of 500 -ml tubes (Step 14). 6. Combine the media collected at 72 h post trans fection (Step 4) with the media and cells collected at 120 h post transfection (Step 5). For smaller viral preps (1 -5 dishes), use option A. For larger preps (6 -10 dishes), use option B. (A) Harvest from 1 -5 dishes (i) Pour the media collected in Step 4 into the corresponding 250 -ml tube of media and cells collected in Step 5. Critical Step: Save the bottles from Step 4 for Step 8. (B) Harvest from 6 -10 dishes (i) Pour the media collected in Step 4 into a new 250 -ml tube. Critical Step: Save the bottl es from Step 4 for Step 8. 63 7. Centrifuge the media and cells at 2,000g for 15 min at RT. Ensure that the tube caps are tightly secured. Centrifugation will result in the formation of a cell pellet ( Figure 2.7b). 8. Pour off the supernatant (i.e., the c larified media) into the corresponding bottle from Step 4. Allow excess media to drip back down onto the beveled edge of the 250 -ml tube; remove using a P1000 pipette and add to the supernatant. Store the supe rnatant at 4 \u00b0C until Step 10. Critical Step: Failure to remove excess media from the pellet will cause several milliliters of media to dilute the SAN digestion buffer in Step 9. 9. Cell pellet resuspension. Prepare 5 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer ( Reagent setup ) per viral prep. For smaller viral preps (1 -5 dishes), use option A. For larger preps (6 -10 dishes), use option B. (A) Harvest from 1 -5 dishes (i) Use a 5 -ml serological pipette to gently resuspend the cell pellet in 5 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer; pipette into a 50 -ml tube to finish resuspending the pellet ( Figure 2.7b). (ii) Incubate in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 1 h and store at 4 \u00b0C until Step 14 (up to 1 d). Critical Step: Be sure to collect the entire pellet, which will stick to the walls and beveled edges of 250 -ml tubes. Save th e 250 -ml tubes for Step 10. Critical Step: The high salt content of SAN digestion buffer lyses the cells, which release the viral particles and nucleic acids into the solution. Initially, the cell lysate may be viscous and difficult to pipette; SAN will d egrade nucleic acids and reduce the viscosity after incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The pH of the lysate will decrease to 8 -9 or lower during cell lysis, but the lysate should appear pink rather than yellow/orange because of residual phenol red (Figure 2.7b). Note th at the expression of fluorescent proteins from strong promoters (e.g., CAG) can alter the color of the lysate. 64 Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the cell lysate for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. (B) Harvest from 6 -10 dishes (i) Use a 10 -ml serological pipette to partially resuspend the smaller cell pellet in 5 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer. Pipette into the second 250 -ml tube containing the larger pellet and resuspend together; pipette into a 50 -ml finish resuspending the pellet (Figure 2.7b). (ii) Incubate in a 37 \u00b0C wa ter bath for 1 h and store at 4 \u00b0C until Step 14 (up to 1 d). Critical Step: Be sure to collect the entire pellet, which will stick to the walls and beveled edges of 250 -ml tubes. Save the 250 -ml tubes for Step 10. Critical Step: The high salt content of SAN digestion buffer lyses the cells, which release viral particles and nucleic acids into solution. Initially, the cell lysate may be viscous and difficult to pipette; SAN will degrade nucleic acids and reduce the viscosity after incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The pH of the lysate will decrease to 8 -9 or lower during cell lysis, but the lysate should appear pink rather than yellow/orange because of residual phenol red (Figure 2.7b). Note that expression of fluorescent proteins from strong promoters (e.g., CAG) can alter the color of the lysate. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the cell lysate for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at whi ch stage the virus may have been lost. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 65 10. Retrieve the supernatant collected in Step 8. For smaller viral preps (1 -5 dishes), use option A. For larger preps (6 -10 dishes), use option B. (A) Harvest from 1 -5 dishes (i) Pour the supernatant from Step 8 into the correspo nding 250 -ml tube from Step 9. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the media for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, th e sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. (B) Harvest from 6 -10 dishes (i) Equally divide the supernatant from Step 8 between the two correspon ding 250 -ml tubes from Step 9. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the media for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. 11. Use a 25 -ml or 50 -ml serological pipette to add a 1/5 final volume of 40% (wt/vol) PEG stock solution to the supernatant (i.e., the supernatant should contain a final concentration of 8% (wt/vol) PEG solution). Tighten the cap and thoroughly invert ten times to mix. Incuba te on ice for 2 h. Critical Step: For AAV production in HEK293T cells, the cell culture media contains a large fraction of the expected yield231. Failure to PEG -precipitate AAV particles in the media wil l result in lower viral yields181. Pause Point: The PEG -media mixture can be incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. 12. Centrifuge the PEG -media mixture at 4,000g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Centrifugation will result in the formation of a PEG pellet ( Figure 2.7b). 66 13. Pour off the supernatant (i.e., the PEG -clarified media) into a used media collection bottle for bleaching. Allow excess media to drip back down onto the beveled edge of the 250-ml tube; aspirate or pipette to remove. 14. PEG pellet resuspen sion. Prepare 1 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer ( Reagent setup ) per viral prep. For smaller viral preps (1 -5 dishes), use option A. For larger preps (6 -10 dishes), use option B. (A) Harvest from 1 -5 dishes (i) Use a P1000 pipette to carefully resuspend the PEG pellet in 1 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer; pipette into the corresponding lysate from Step 9 ( Figure 2.7b). (ii) Incubate in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for an additional 30 min. Critical Step: Resuspending the PEG pellet is difficult and will take ~5 min per pellet. Be sure to collect the entire pellet, some of which will stick to the walls and beveled edges of 250-ml tubes. During resuspension, avoid air bubbles, which can be difficult to collect with a pipette and may disrupt capsid structure. Do not use a serological pipette to resuspend the pellet, which can become lodged wit hin the barrel of the pipette. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the PEG pellet resuspension, before adding it to the corresponding lysate, for troubleshooti ng; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. Pause Point : Store the lysate at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Alternatively, use a dry ice -ethanol bath to freeze the lysate; store at 20 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. (B) Harvest from 6 -10 dishes (i) Use a P1000 pipette to partially resuspend one of the PEG pellets in 1 ml of SAN + SAN digestion buffer. Pipette into the second 250 -ml tube containing the second pellet and 67 carefully resuspend together; pipette into the correspondin lysate from Step ( Figure 2.7b). (ii) Incubate in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for an additional 30 min. Critical Step: Resuspending the PEG pellet is difficult and will take ~5 min per pellet. Be sure to collect the entire pellet, some of which will stick to the walls and beveled edges of 250-ml tubes. During resuspension, avoid air bubbles, which can be difficult to collect with a pipette and may disrupt capsid structure. Do not us e a serological pipette to resuspend the pellet, which can become lodged wit hin the barrel of the pipette. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the PEG pellet resuspension, before adding it to the corresponding lysate, for troubleshooting ; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. Pause Point: Store the lysate at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Alternatively, use a dry ice -ethanol bath to freeze the lysate; store at 20 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. AAV purification Timing 1 d Critical: One iodixanol density gradient is sufficient to purify virus from up to ten 150 - mm dishes. If more than ten dishes per prep are used, divide the lysate into more than one gradient. The AAV purification steps are most easily learned by visualization; refer to Figure 2.8 and Supplementary Videos 2.ST 1-3 for details. 15. Determine the number of gradients needed and prepare the iodixanol density grad ient solutions ( Reagent setup and Supplementary Table 2.ST 3). Set the OptiSeal tubes in the rack provided in the OptiSeal tube kit; alternatively, use the long edge o f a 50 -ml tube Styrofoam rack. 68 Caution: Check the OptiSeal tubes for defects; tubes with dents may collapse during ultracentrifugation. 16. Pour the density gradients ( Figure 2.8a,b and Supplementary Video 2.V1, 0:00 -1:45, or Supplementary Video 2.V2, 0:00 -1:13). Each gradient is composed of the following layers: 6 ml of 15% (wt/vol) iodixano l, 6 60% (wt/vol) iodixanol ( Supplementary Table 2.ST 3). Pour the layers with a 2 - or 5-ml serological pipette. We typically use a 2 -ml pipette; using a 5 - ml pipette is faster but re quires the use of PTFE and Tygon tubing and extra reagents. To load the layers with a 2 -ml pipette, choose option A. To load the layers with a 5 -ml pipette, choose option B. (A) Loading with a 2 -ml pipette (i) Begin by pipetting 6 ml (measure to the 3 ml mark twice) of 15% (wt/vol) iodixanol to each tube. Next, add 6 ml of 25% (wt/vol) iodixanol under the 15% layer by lightly touching the pipette tip to the bottom of the tube and slowly releasing the solution ( Figure 2.8a and Supplementary Video 2.V1, 0:1 3-1:29). Continue adding layers of increasing density under the previous layer. The gradients should have a sharp delinea tion between layers ( Figure 2. 8b). Critical Step: When loading the 25%, 40%, and 60% layers with a 2 -ml pipette, stop releasing the so lution and slowly remove the pipette once the iodixanol is ~5 mm from the tip of the pipette ( Supplementary Video 2.V1, 0:42 -0:58 and 1:20 -1:25). This will prevent an air bubble from disturbing the gradient. The remaining iodixanol will be released when the pip ette is removed from the tube. Critical Step: Corning brand 2 -ml serological pipettes consistently fit into OptiSeal tubes; other brands should be tested before use. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 69 (B) Loading with a 5 -ml pipette (i) Attach a piece of tubing (see Equipment ) to a 5 -ml pipette. Begin by pipetting 6 ml of 15% (wt/vol) iodixanol into each tube. Next, add 6 ml of 25% (wt/vol) iodixanol under the 15% layer by lightly touching the tubing to the bottom of the tube and slowly releasing the solution ( Supplementary Video 2.V2, 0:17 -1:13). Continue adding layers of increasing density under the previous layer. The gradients should have a sharp delinea tion between layers ( Figure 2.8b). Critical Step: Fill the 5 -ml pipette with more layer solution than is needed (e.g., an extra 1 ml per layer); this will prevent an air bubble from disturbing the gradient when releasing the last of the required volume ( Supplementary Video 2.V2, 1:09 -1:11). Remember to prepare extra solution ( Reagent s etup). Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 17. Centrifuge the lysate from Step 14 at 2,000g for 10 min at RT. Centrifugation will result in the formation of a pellet ( Figure 2.7b). 18. Use a 2 -ml serological pipette to load the supernatant (i .e., the clarified lysate) (~6 -7 ml total) from Step 17 above the 15% (wt/vol) iodixanol layer ( Figure 2.8c Video 2.V2, 1:14 -1:55). Touch the pipette tip to the surface of the 15% layer and slowly re lease the lysate such tha t a layer forms on top. Critical Step: Use a pipetting device with precise control. Do not allow the lysate to drip from the pipette tip onto the 15% layer; this will cause the lysate to mix with the gradient. Note that Corning bra nd 2-ml serological pipettes consistently fit into OptiSeal tubes; other brand s should be tested before use. Critical Step: The pellet may be soft, making it difficult to retrieve all of the supernatant. After loading 6 -7 ml of lysate above the 15% layer, spin the lysate for an additional 15 70 min at 3,000g at RT; use a P200 or P1000 pipette to slowly load the remaining supernatant onto the lysate layer. Discard the pellet in 10% (vol/vol) bl each or a biohazard waste bin. Critical Step: (Optional) Collect a 30-\u00b5l sample from the lysate for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. 19. Using a 2 -ml serological pi pette, fill each tube up to the neck with SAN digestion buffer. Firmly insert a black cap ( Figure 2.8d) and place a spacer on top ( Figure 2.8e). Caps and spacers are provided with the OptiSeal tubes and in the OptiSeal tube kit, respectively. Caution: Overfilling the tube can cause a spill when inserting the black cap. Handling the tubes without caps, or with loosely fitted caps, can also cause spills. Caution: Avoid air bubbles, which can cause the OptiSeal tubes to collap se during ultracentrifugation. Critical Step: The black cap should fit right above or touch the lysate. 20. Weigh the tubes with the caps and spacers on. Balance the tubes to within 5 -10 mg of each other using SAN digestion buffer. Be sure to adjust the tube weight in the biosafety cabinet; use the tube removal tool provided with the OptiSeal tube kit to remove the black cap and add the appropriate volume of SAN digestion buffer with a P20 or P200 pipette. Caution: Failure to balance the tubes before ultracentrifugation could result i n damaged equipment. 21. Place the ultracentrifuge rotor in the biosafety cabinet. Load the tubes and fasten the lid. 71 Caution: Ensure that the rotor is in proper working order. This includes checking that the o -rings are intact, as cracked o -rings can c ause virus to spill during ultracentrifugation. Also, check that the rotor and tubes are completely dry; moisture between tubes and the tube cavity can cause tubes to collapse. To prevent damage to the rotor, set it on a paper towel so that the over -speed disk at the bottom is not scratched. 22. Carefully transfer the rotor to the ultracentrifuge. Spin the Type 70 Ti rotor at 350,000g (58,400 r.p.m.) for 2 h and 25 min at 18 \u00b0C with slow acceleration (no. 3; the instrument will take 3 min to accelerate to 500 r.p.m., followed by maximum acceleration) and deceleration (no. 9; the instrument will decelerate at maximum speed until it reaches 500 r.p.m., then take 6 min to stop) profiles. Alternatively, a Type 60 Ti rotor can be used at 358,000 g (59,000 r.p.m .). Caution: Always follow the manufacturer's instructions while operating an ultracentrifuge. 23. During ultracentrifugation, gather the supplies and equipment for Steps 24 -27. Assemble the clamp setup ( Equipment setup ) and collect one of each of the f ollowing per gradient: Amicon Ultra -15 centrifugal filter syringe, 10 -ml syringe, 0.22 -\u00b5m syringe filter unit, and a 16 -gauge needle. 24. After ultracentrifugation, bring the rotor inside the biosafety cabinet and remove the lid. Use the spa cer removal tool provided with the OptiSeal tube kit to remove the spacer from the first tube. Next, use the tube removal tool to grip the tube neck. Slowly remove the tube from the rotor and secure it into the clamp setup above a 500 -ml or 1 -liter beaker containing fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach ( Figure 2.8f). Clean the side of the tube with a paper towel or a Kimwipe sprayed with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. Caution: The black cap may become dislodged from the tube during removal, increasing the likelihood of a sp ill. Try replacing the cap before removing the tube from the rotor. Otherwise, replace the cap once the tube is secured in the clamp setup. 72 Caution: If a tube collapses during ultracentrifugation, take extra care when removing the tube from the rotor. Use fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach to wipe the tube before proceeding with AAV purification. Viruses purified from collapsed tubes may have lower yields. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 25. Prepare the supplies for Steps 26 and 27. First, remove a nd save the plunger from a 10-ml syringe. Attach a 0.22 -\u00b5m syringe filter unit to the syringe barrel and place it on top of an Amicon filter device. Next, add 10 ml of DPBS to the barrel and allow the solution to begin dripping through the syringe filter u nit and into the filter device ( Figure 2.8f). Last, attach a 16 -gauge needle to a 5-ml syringe. Critical Step : Amicon filter devices contain traces of glycerine. If this interferes with downstream applications, rinse the device with DPBS before use. (Opti onal) Rinse the filtration membrane of the Amicon filter device by adding 15 ml of DPBS to the top chamber and centrifuging at 3,000 g for 1 min at RT; discard the flow -through. The manufacturer recommends using the device immediately after rinsing. 26. From the tube clamped in Step 24, collect the virus from the 40/60% interface and 40% layer182,183 (Figure 2.8g and Supplementary Video 2.V3, 0:00 -1:30). Hold the top of the OptiSeal tube with your non -dominant hand; use your dominant hand to hold the needle/syringe. Use a forward -twisting motion to insert the needle ~4 mm below the 40/60% interface (i.e., where the tube just starts to curve). Use the tube removal tool in your non -dominant hand to remove the black cap from the tube to provide a hole for air entry. With the needle bevel up, use the needle/syringe to collect 4.0 -4.5 ml of virus/ iodixanol from the 40/60% interface and 40% layer. Do not collect from the white protein layer at the 25/40% interface; as this interface is approached, rotate the needle bevel do wn and continue collecting from the 40% layer. Firmly replace the black cap before removing the needle from the tube. 73 Caution: Keep your hands out of the path of the needle to prevent accidental exposure to AAVs. Failure to firmly replace the black cap be fore removing the needle will cause the AAV -contaminated solution to flow out of the needle hole in the tube and potentially onto and out of the biosafety cabinet. Perform this step over a large beaker of fresh 1 0% (vol/vol) bleach ( Figure 2.8f). Critical Step: The virus should concentrate at the 40/60% interface and within the 40% layer10. There will not be a visible virus band, but the phenol red in the 25% and 60% layers helps to better define the 40% cushion. Critical Step : Before attempting to collect virus from the density gradient, practice on an OptiSeal tube filled with water. Critical Step : (Optional) Collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the virus/iodixanol for troubleshooting; store at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week. If the viral yield is lower than expected, the sample can be titered (Steps 32 -42) to determine at which stage the virus may have been lost. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 27. Add the 4.0 -4.5 ml of virus/iodixanol to the syringe barrel containing 10 ml of DPBS (prepared in Step 25) ( Figure 2.8h and Supplementary Video 2.V3, 1:31 -2:06). Layer the virus below the DPBS by placing the needle near the bottom of the barrel and pressing on the plunger. Insert the 10 -ml syringe plunger into the barrel and push the virus/DPBS mixture through th e syringe filter unit and into the Amicon filter device ( Supplementary Video 2.V3, 2:07 -2:32). M ix well using a P1000 pipette. Critical Step : This filtration step reduces the likelihood of clogging the filtration membrane in the Amicon filter device. The virus/iodixanol mixture will be difficult to push through the syringe filter unit; DPBS will be easy to push th rough as it washes the filter. 74 Critical Step : AAVs adhere to hydrophobic surfaces, including nonionic surfactant that may reduce virus loss associated with sticking to plastics. (Optional) Include 0.001% (vol/vol) Pluronic F -68 in the DPBS for Steps 27 -30. 28 Centrifuge the virus/DPBS mixture at 3,000g for 5 -8 min at RT, or unti l the volume of the solution remaining in the top chamber of the Amicon filter device is 500 -1,500 \u00b5l (>10\u00d7 concentrated). Critical Step : This step may take longer because iodixanol initially slows the passage of the solution through the filtration membra ne. 29. Discard the flow -through for bleaching. Add 13 ml of DPBS to the virus in the top chamber a nd use a P1000 pipette to mix. Critical Step : Remove the filter device, which contains the virus, before discarding the flow through. 30. Centrifuge the virus/DPBS mixture as in Step 28. Wash the virus two more times for a total of four buffer exchanges. During the last spin, retain 300 -500 \u00b5l o f solution in the top chamber. Critical Step : The third and fourth washes may require only a 2 -3-min spin until the desired volume remains in the top chamber. Critical Step : The volume retained in the top chamber will affect the final virus concentration (vg/ml) (i.e., the lower the volume, the higher the concentration). A final volume of 300 -500 \u00b5l should work fo r most applications, assuming a production efficiency of at least 1 \u00d7 1012 vg/dish and a dose and injection volume of no more than 1 \u00d7 1012 vg and 100 \u00b5l, respectively (see ' Experimental design ' section and Step 43 for dose and injection volume recommendat ions, respectively). For direct injections, a final volume of 200 \u00b5l may be optimal. Note that retaining too low a volume may cause the virus to aggregate during storage at 4 \u00b0C (see Step 42 for details). 75 31. Use a P200 pipette to transfer the virus from the top chamber of the Amicon filter device directly to a 1.6 -ml screw -cap vial; store at 4 \u00b0C. Critical Step : Amicon filter devices are not sterile. If this is a concern for specific applications, the virus can be filter -sterilized before storage. (Opti onal) Filter -sterilize the virus. Use a P200 pipette to transfer the virus from the top chamber of the Amicon filter device directly to a Costar Spin -X filter unit within a centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the virus at 3,000 g for 1 min at RT. Discard the filte r unit and transfer the purified virus from the centrifuge tube to a 1.6 -ml screw -cap vial; store at 4 \u00b0C. Critical Step : The screw -cap vials are not low protein binding; however, they help prevent the formation of aerosols when opening and closing the tu bes. We store AAVs in screw - cap vials at 4 \u00b0C and typically use them within 3 months, during which time we have not noticed a decrease in titers or transduction efficiency in vivo . We have not rigorously tested the effects of long -term storage at 20 \u00b0C or 80 \u00b0C for systemically delivered viruses. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. Pause Point: Store the purified virus at 4 \u00b0C for up to 3 months. AAV titration Timi ng 1 d Critical : The AAV titration procedure below is adapted from ref.184. Each virus sample is prepared in triplicate in separate 1.5 -ml DNA/RNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes and later loaded into a 9 6-well plate for qPCR. All solutions must be accurately pipetted and thoroughly mixed; qPCR is highly sensitive to small changes in DNA concentration. 32. Prepare a plan for the PCR plate setup. Allocate the first 24 wells (A1 -B12) for the DNA standards such that standard no. 1 occupies wells A1 -A3, standard no. 2 occupies 76 wells A4 -A6, and so on. Use the remaining wells for the virus samples such that the first virus sample occupies wells C1 -C3, the second sample occupies wells C4 -C6, and so on. Critical Step: Include DPBS as a negative control and a virus sample with a known concentration as a positive control; prepare the controls with the virus samples in Steps 33 - 40. 33. Use DNase I to digest DNA that was not packaged into the viral capsid. Prepare DNase I + DNase digestion buffer ( Reagent setup ) and add 100 \u00b5l to each 1.5 -ml tube. Vortex each virus for 1 -2 s to mix; alternatively, use a P200 pipette to mix. Add 2 \u00b5l of the virus to each of three tubes. Vortex for 1 -2 s to mix and spin down (2,000g, RT, 10 s); incubate in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 1 h. Critical Step : Do not vortex/pipette the virus vigorously or vortex longer than 1 -2 s; exposure to force may disrupt capsid structure. Critical Step : When dipping the pipette tip into the virus stock, in sert the tip just below the surface of the liquid rather than dipping it deep inside. Excess virus carried on the outside of the tip will carry over into the DNase digestion buffer and cause variations in the titer. Critical Step : Prepare each virus sampl e in triplicate. 34. Inactivate the DNase. Add 5 \u00b5l of EDTA to each tube; vortex for 1 -2 s to mix, spin down (2,000 g, RT, 10 s), and incubate i n a 70 \u00b0C dry bath for 10 min. Critical Step : DNase must be inactivated or else it will degrade the viral gen ome when it is released from the viral capsid in Step 35. 35. Use proteinase K to digest the viral capsid and release the viral genome. Prepare proteinase K + proteinase K solution ( Reagent setup ) and add 120 \u00b5l to each tube. Vortex for 1 -2 s to mix and spin down (2,000 g, RT, 10 s); incubat e in a 50 \u00b0C dry bath for 2 h. Pause Point: Samples can be incubated at 50 \u00b0C overnight. 77 36. During the last 20 min of the proteinase K digestion, prepare the DNA standard dilutions ( Reagent setup ) and use the Qubit assay to measure the concentration (ng/ \u00b5l) of the DNA standard stock. Critical Step : The concentration of the standard stock solution is used to generate the standard curve after qPCR ( Supplementary Table 2.ST 4, cell B9). To measure the concentration of t he standard stock solution, use the Qubit fluorometer, which measures low DNA concentrations with high sensitivity and accuracy. 37. Inactivate the proteinase K. Incubate the tubes in a 95 \u00b0C dry bath for 10 min. Caution : Tube caps may pop open unexpect edly; use safety glasses while removing the tubes from the 95 \u00b0C dry bath. Critical Step : Proteinase K must be inactivated or else it will digest the DNA polymerase during qPCR. 38. Allow the tubes to cool for 5 min. Vortex each sample for 1 -2 s to mix and add 3 \u00b5l to a new tube containing 897 \u00b5l of UltraPure water (a 1:300 dilution). Vortex the diluted samples for 3 s to mix. 39. Prepare the qPCR master mix ( Reagent setup ). 40. Load the PCR plate based on the experimental plan from Step 32. First, p ipette 23 \u00b5l of qPCR master mix into each designated well. Next, pipette 2 \u00b5l of each standard into wells A1 -B12. Last, pipette 2 \u00b5l of each diluted sample from Step 38 into wells C1 and onward. Seal the plate with sealing film and briefly spin down (500 g, RT, 10 s) in a plate spinner. 41. Place the PCR plate into the qPCR machine. Use the following cycling parameters: Step 1: 95 \u00b0C, 10 min Step 2: 95 \u00b0C, 15 s Step 3: 60 \u00b0C, 20 s Step 4: 60 \u00b0C, 40 s Repeat steps 2 -4 40\u00d7. 78 42. When the qPCR run is complet e, export the cycle threshold (Ct) values to an Excel file. Copy and paste the Ct values into Supplementary Table 2.ST 4 ('AAV titration calculator ' sheet) to generate a standard curve and calculate the titer (vg/ml) (cell G27) of each virus; calculate per -plate production (vg/dish) (cell K27) to assess production efficiency. Be sure to enter the appropriate values in cells B7 -10 and B18; see ' Example ' sheet. Critical Step : If the titer is 1 \u00d7 1014 vg/ml, the virus may aggregate during storage at 4 \u00b0C. Dil ute the virus to between 2 \u00d7 1013 and 5 \u00d7 1013 vg/ml with DPBS and re -titer the diluted to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. Intravenous (retro -orbital) injection Timing <5 min per mouse, excluding setup and cleanup time Caution : Follo w appropriate institutional and governmental guidelines and regulations for husbandry and handling of laboratory animals. Compared to tail -vein injections, retro - orbital injections require less technical expertise and may cause less distress in mice185; however, tail -vein injections appear to result in similar AAV distribution158,160. Critical: When possible, verify viral transduction and transgene expression in vitro before systemic administration. Note that co -injecting AAVs with other substances (e.g., dyes) could affect infectivity in vivo and s hould be tested independently. Critical: Re-titer viruses before inje ction if more than 1 month has passed since titration; this will ensure that animals are administered the most accurate dose possible. 43. Determine the dose of virus to administer per mouse (see ' Experimental design ' section for recommendations). Divide the dose (vg) by the titer (vg/ml) ( Supplementary Table 2.ST 4, cell G27) to calculate the volume of virus needed to inject one mouse. In a screw - 79 cap vial, prepare a master mix of virus based on the number of animals to be injected; briefly vortex each vir us and master mix for 1 -2 s before use. Transport the virus on ice once it is ready for injection. Caution: Do not inject more than 10% of the mouse blood volume, which correspon ds to 150 \u00b5l for a 25 -g mouse. Critical Step: Depending on the user, it is e asiest to inject 40 -80 \u00b5l/mouse. If <40 \u00b5l/mouse is required, use DPBS or saline to dilute the virus such that a larger volume is injected. If more than 80 \u00b5l/mouse is required, it may be more convenient to re -concentrate the virus or perform two separate injections; follow institutional guidelines for multiple eye injections. Virus will be lost in the event of an unsuccessful injection; therefore, prepare more master mix than is required. Critical Step: To reduce the chance of contaminating the virus stoc k, avoid using the original virus stock; bring only an aliquot of what is needed for the injections. Critical Step: Do not store diluted viruses; only dilute what is needed immediately before injection. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 44. Assemble the anesthesia system229 (Equipment setup ) inside the biosafety cabinet. 45. Remove the mouse from its cage and place it in the induction chamber. Anesthetize the mouse with 1 -5% isoflurane in oxygen. Caution: Isoflurane must be handled according to federal, state, and local regulations. 46. While the mouse is being induced, load an insulin syringe with virus. Remove the dead space in the syringe barrel by gently ejecting the virus back into the tube such that air bubbles are expelled. Load the syringe again and repeat the procedure until no bubbles remain in the barrel. 80 Caution: Introducing air into the vascular system can be fatal. Critical Step: Introducing air into the virus may cause protein denaturation; perform this step gently and only until no bubbles remain in the syringe barrel. 47. Remove the anesthetized mouse from the induction chamber. Place the animal in a prone position on a small stack of paper towels. Position the mouse such that its head is situated on t he same side as the operator's dominant hand. Place the nose cone on the mouse to maintain anesthesia. 48. Use the index finger and thumb of the non -dominant hand to draw back the skin above and below the eye, causing the eye to slightly protrude from th e socket185. With the dominant hand, insert the needle, bevel down, at a 30 -45\u00b0 angle into the medial canthus and through the conjunctival m embrane. The needle should be positioned behind the globe of the eye in the retro -orbital sinus. Slowly release the virus into the sinus and gently remove the needle. Caution: Assess anesthetic depth by loss of pedal reflex (via toe pinch) before insertin g the needle into the retro -orbital sinus. Any movement of the eye or skin when the needle is inserted indicates incorrect needle placement. Keep hands out of the path of the needle to prevent accidental exposure to AAVs. Do not recap needles; discard into an approved biohazardous sharps co ntainer immediately after use. Critical Step: No liquid should leak out of the eye after viral delivery; likewise, little to no bleeding should be observed. Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 49. Following v iral injection, apply mild pressure to the eyelid. Apply 1 -2 drops of proparacaine to the corneal surface to provide local analgesia. After recovery from anesthesia, place the mouse in a clean cage. 81 Caution: Monitor the eye daily after injection for 2 d, or according to institutional guidelines. Evaluation of transgene expression Timing variable; see ' Experimental design ' section Caution: Follow appropriate institutional and governmental guidelines and regulations for husbandry and handling of laborato ry animals. 50. To assess endogenous fluorescence ( Figures 2.2-2.5), anesthetize and transcardially perfuse232 the animals after sufficient time has passed for viral transduction and protein expression (see ' Experimental design ' section for recommendations). Cut thin233 or thick234 tissue slices and mount them in RIMS171,218 or a commercially available mounting media such as Prolong Diamond Antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. P36965) or Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. H -1000 -10). Alternatively, use PACT - or PARS -based clearing171,218 of whole organs or animals, respectively, or another clearing method (e.g., ScaleSQ170). Ensure that the chosen clearing protocol is compatible with the fluorescent protein(s) under investigation (see ' Experimental design ' and 'Anticipate d results' sections for details). Native fluorescence can be using a fluorescence (e.g., (e.g., custom -made218 or LaVision BioTec UltraMicroscope II), depending on the tissue volume and desired imaging resolutio n. For experiments without fluorescent labels, evaluate transgene expression using molecular (e.g., qPCR3 or Western blot219), histological218 (e.g., with antibodies or molecular probe s), or functional (e.g., optical imaging217) methods relevant to the experimental aims. Regardless of the approach used to evaluate gene expression, cell type -specific promoters should be verified at this stage in the protocol; we typically assess cell morphol ogy and/or use antibody staining to confirm specificity133 (Figure 2.2b,c). Refer to Table 2.T3 for troubleshooting tips. 82 2.5 TROUBLESHOOTING Troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 2.T3.

Ensure cells are not over -confluent at the time o f transfection, and change media no more than 24 h post transfection Weak fluorescent reporter and/or promoter, or promoter Include a positive transfection control (e.g., pAAV -CAG -eYFP). Note that some pr omoters may take 2-3 d to show expression 83 Step Problem Possible reason Solution cannot initiate gene expression in HEK293T cells Transgene expression depends on Flp or Cre recombinase Include a positive transfection control (see above) Transfection miscalculation Carefully follow the instructions in the Reagent setup and Supplementary Table 2 ('Transfection calculator' sheet) to prepare the PEI + DPBS master mix and DNA + DPBS solutions 9 (AAV harvest) Cell lysate is not pink pH of the lysate is too low Check the pH of the lysate by pipetting 30 \u00b5l onto a pH strip; adjust the pH to 8.5 with NaOH suitable for cell culture. In subsequent viral preps, ensure that the pH of SAN digestion buffer is ~10.0; during cell lysis, the pH should drop to 8.5 -9.0, which is optimal for SAN digestion Fluorescent protein expression from a strong promo ter (e.g., CAG) Expression of blue/green or red fluorescent proteins from strong promoters can cause the lysate to turn yellow or red, respectively; proceed with AAV production 16 (AAV purification) Density gradients have no clear delineation between iodi xanol layers Layers are mixed Repour the gradients (Supplementary Video 1, 0:00 - 1:45, or Supplementary Video 2, 0:00-1:13); gradients should be poured fresh and not allowed to sit for too long 84 Step Problem Possible reason Solution 24 (AAV purification) Tube collapsed during ultracentrifugatio n An air bubble was trapped underneath the black cap Carefully remove the tube from the rotor and wipe it with fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach before proceeding with AAV purification. In future viral preps, remove air bubbles with a P200 pipette before ultracen trifugation The rotor and/or OptiSeal tubes were not in proper working order Carefully remove the tube from the rotor and wipe it with fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach before proceeding with AAV purification. In future viral preps, check that the rotor and tubes are completely dry; moisture between tubes and the tube cavity can cause tubes to collapse. Also check tubes for dents before pouring the density gradients 26 (AAV purification) Cannot puncture the OptiSeal tube with the needle Not enough force is use d Use a forward -twisting motion to insert the needle into the tube (Supplementary Video 3, 0:06 - 0:21); practice on an OptiSeal tube filled with water Two holes were punctured through the OptiSeal tube Too much force was used See above. Do not remove the needle; carefully insert a new needle and proceed to collect virus Cannot collect virus with the needle Black cap was not removed Use the tube removal tool to remove the black cap from the tube after inserting the needle but before collecting virus (Fig. 8g and Supplementary Video 3, 0:22 - 0:30); practice on an OptiSeal tube filled with water Plastic from the tube is lodged inside the needle Firmly replace the black cap and remo ve the needle from the tube; insert a new needle into the same hole, remove the black cap, and try collecting virus again 85 Step Problem Possible reason Solution Density gradient flows out of the needle hole in the tube after removal of the needle Black cap was not firmly replaced Act quickly; use the beaker of bleach to catch the liquid and firmly replace the black cap to stop the flow. In subsequent viral preps, ensure that the black cap is replaced before removing the needle from the tube (Supplementary Video 3, 1:19-1:30); practice on an Op tiSeal tube filled with water 31 (AAV purification) Purified virus is cloudy The virus/DPBS mixture was not mixed and contains iodixanol Repeat the buffer exchanges in Steps 28 -30. In future viral preps, thoroughly mix the virus/DPBS mixture using a P1000 pipette in Steps 27, 29, and 30 Unknown material is suspended in purified virus Salt, DNA, or viral precipitation Before titering or injecting the virus, spin down the precipitate at 3,000 g for 5 min at RT and transfer the supernatant (i.e., the virus) to a new screw -cap vial. We have not noticed a decrease in titer after removing precipitate from our preps; however, it is a good practice to re-titer a virus if precipitate has formed Bacterial contamination Bleach the virus. In future viral preps, fil ter-sterilize viruses after purification, and only open tubes containing viruses in a biosafety cabinet. During intravenous injections, never use the original virus stock; bring only an aliquot of what is needed for injection Carry -over from the filtrat ion membrane of Filter -sterilize the virus 86 Step Problem Possible reason Solution the Amicon filter device 42 (AAV titration) No SYBR signal detected for DNA standards or virus samples Missing reagents (e.g., primers) in qPCR reaction Check that all qPCR reagents were added to the master mix a nd that the DNA standards and virus samples were added to their respective wells Degraded reagents Use fresh, properly stored qPCR reagents No SYBR signal detected for virus samples DNase was not inactivated, resulting in degradation of the viral geno me during proteinase K treatment Repeat the titration procedure; be sure to inactivate DNase with EDTA at 70 \u00b0C (Step 34) Proteinase K was not inactivated, resulting in degradation of DNA polymerase during qPCR Repeat the titration procedure; be sure to inactivate Proteinase K at 95 \u00b0C (Step 37) Triplicates do not have similar Ct values Inaccurate pipetting and/or inadequate mixing of reagents Repeat the qPCR; pipette accurately and thoroughly mix all reagents before use Standard curve is not linear Inaccurate pipetting and/or inadequate mixing of reagents while preparing the Repeat the qPCR; pipette accurately and thoroughly mix all reagents while preparing the DNA standard dilutions. Note that at low concentrations (high Ct va lues), standard nos. 1 and 2 will deviate from linearity (Supplementary 87 Step Problem Possible reason Solution DNA standard dilutions Table 4, 'Example' sheet). This is normal; the qPCR does not need to be repeated DNA standards degraded and/or stuck to the walls of 1.5 - ml tubes Repeat the qPCR; prepare the DNA standard dilutions fresh, immediately before use, and use only DNA/RNA LoBind microcentrifuge tubes. Note that at low concentrations (high Ct values), standard nos. 1 and 2 will deviate from linearity (Supplementary Table 4, 'Example' sheet). This is normal; the qPCR does not need to be repeated Viral yield is lower than expected (Supplementary Table 4, cell K27) Transfection, AAV harvest, AAV purification, and/or AAV titration were not successful Include a positive transfection/virus production control (e. g., pAAV -CAG -eYFP) and a positive titration control. To determine at which stage the virus may have been lost, collect a 30 -\u00b5l sample from the cell lysate (Step 9), the media before PEG precipitation (Step 10), the PEG pellet resuspension (Step 14), and th e lysate before (Step 18) and after iodixanol purification (Step 26). Store samples at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1 week for titering (Steps 32 -42) AAV capsid and/or genome results in poor production efficiency Scale up viral preps to ensure enough virus is produc ed for downstream applications ITRs underwent recombination After plasmid purification, but before transfection, digest pAAVs with SmaI to confirm the presence of ITRs, which are required for 88 Step Problem Possible reason Solution during bacterial growth replication and encapsidation of the viral genome; always propagate pAAVs in recombination -deficient bacterial strains 43 (intravenous injection) A large volume (e.g., more than 100 \u00b5l, depending on user preference) of virus needs to be injected Virus concentration is too low Reconcentrate t he virus using an Amicon filter device. Add 13 ml of DPBS and the virus to the top chamber of the Amicon filter device and use a P1000 pipette to mix. Centrifuge at 3,000 g at RT until the desired volume of solution remains in the top chamber 48 (Intraveno us injection) Virus spills out of the eye during injection Incorrect needle placement Absorb the spilled virus using a paper towel; disinfect AAV - contaminated surfaces and materials with fresh 10% (vol/vol) bleach or an equivalent disinfectant. Load the sa me insulin syringe with more virus, position the needle behind the globe of the eye in the retro -orbital sinus, and try the injection again. Practice injections using DPBS or saline until comfortable with the procedure Bleeding before, during, or after injection Incorrect needle placement Position the needle behind the globe of the eye in the retro -orbital sinus; never puncture the eye itself. Inject the virus slowly; following injection, carefully remove the needle at the same angle at which it was inser ted. Practice injections using DPBS or saline until comfortable with the procedure Needle is left in the injection site for too long Once the needle is correctly placed in the eye, immediately inject the virus 89 Step Problem Possible reason Solution 50 (Evaluation of transgene expression) Weak or no transgene expression in the tissue of interest Sufficient time has not passed for protein expression Wait longer for optimal protein expression Dose is too low, or dose is too high, causing cell toxicity Inject multiple animals with a series of doses and sacrifice them at different time points (e.g., weekly) to determine the optimal dose Titer is inaccurate Re-titer viruses before injection if more than 1 month has passed since titration; this will ensure that the animals are administered the most accurate dose possible Virus degraded See above. Store AAV -PHP viruses at 4 \u00b0C for up to 3 months, during which time we have not noticed a decrease in titers or transduction efficiency in vivo . Do not store diluted viruses; dilute only what is nee ded immediately before retro-orbital injection Weak or no expression from the AAV genome Verify the integrity of pAAV plasmids by sequencing and restriction digestion before transfection. If possible, verify viral transduction and transgene expression i n vitro before systemic administration Poor viral injection Inject multiple animals to increase the chance of success Fluorescent protein and/or signal deteriorates in chemical - clearing reagents Ensure that the chosen clearing protocol is compatible with the fluorescent protein(s) under investigation (see 'Experimental design' and 'Anticipated results' sections for details) 90 Step Problem Possible reason Solution Fluorescent signal photobleaches during imaging Fluorescent protein is sensitive to photobleaching (e.g., during long imaging sessions or at high magnification) Use a different fluorescent protein with similar spectral properties but higher photostability (e.g., tdTomato rather than mRuby2, or eGFP rather than Emerald) Lipofuscin accumulation Aging tissue Reduce autofluorescence using histological methods (e.g., Sudan black) or, if possible, inject younger adults (8 weeks old) and determine the minimum time required for transgene expression 2.6 TIMING Refer to Figure 2.7a for a time line of the Procedure.

Production efficiency can be determined for each virus in Step 42 ( Supplementary Table 2.ST 4, cell K27). Note that yields may vary from prep to prep and genome to genome. Users can gauge production effi ciency for each experiment by running a positive control (e.g., pAAV -CAG -eYFP). Evaluation of transgene expression For most applications, users can expect to assess transduced cells beginning 2 or more weeks after intravenous injection (see ' Experimental design ' section for details). The chosen method for evaluating transgene expression will vary from user to user and may involve molecular, histological, and/or functional approaches220 (Step 50). We typically use fluorescent reporters to assess gene expression in thick (100 \u00b5m), cleared tissue samples; below, we discuss expected results for the app lications presented here ( Figures 2.2-2.5) and in our previous work133,157. Commonly used reporters suc h as GFP, eYFP, and tdTomato show strong fluorescent labeling in PACT - and PARS -cleared tissues, enabling whole -organ and thick - tissue imaging of transgene expression157,171,218. Most markers, including mTurquoise2, mNeonGreen, and mRuby2, can also be detected after mounting labeled tissues in optical clearing reagents such as RIMS218 or ScaleSQ170 (Figures 2.3a,c,d, 2.4b-d and 2.5e) or commercially available mounting ( Figure 2.5a,c). Depending on the rAAV genome, fluorescent protein s can be localized to distinct cellular compartments, including the nucleus (via NLS) ( Figure 2.2a,b), cytosol ( Figures 2.2d,e, 2.3, 2.4b and 2.5), and cell membrane (via farnesylation175 or fusion to a membrane protein such as ChR2) ( Figures 2.3d and 2.4d). 92 In summary, we present a comprehensive protocol for the production and administration of AAV -PHP viruses. We have validated the ability of AAV -PHP variants to provide efficient and noninvasive gene delivery to specif ic cell populations throughout the body. Together, this AAV toolbox equips users with the resources needed for a variety of applications across the biomedical sciences. 2.8 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 93 Supplementary Table 2.ST 1: Use of AAV -PHP capsids for e fficient transduction across organs and cell populations.

F., Chen, X., Brown, D., Dobreva, T., Huang, Q., Ding, X., Luo, Y., Einarsson, P.H., A., Cre -dependent selection yields systemic AAVs for targeting distinct brain cell types. Nature Methods (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592 -020-0799 -7 3.1 SUMMARY Recombinant adeno -associated viruses (rAAVs) are efficient gene delivery vectors via intravenous delivery; however, natural serotypes display a finite set of tropisms. To expand their utility, w e evolved AAV capsids to efficiently transduce specific cell types in adult mouse brains. Building upon our Cre -recombination -based AAV targeted evolution (CREATE) platform, we developed Multiplexed -CREATE (M -CREATE) to identify variants of interest in a g iven selection landscape through multiple positive and negative selection criteria. M -CREATE incorporates next -generation sequencing, synthetic library generation , and a dedicated analysis pipeline. We have identified capsid variants that can transduce the central nervous system broadly, exhibit bias toward vascular cells and astrocytes, target neurons with greater specificity , or cross the blood -brain barrier across diverse murine strains. Collectively, the M -CREATE methodology accelerates the discovery of capsids for use in neuroscience and gene -therapy applications. 3.2 INTRODUCTION Recombinant adeno -associated viruses (rAAVs) are widely used as gene delivery vectors in scientific research and therapeutic applications due to their ability to transduce both dividing and non -dividing cells, their long -term persistence as episomal DNA in 97 infected cells, and their low immunogenicity100,155,235 -237. However, gene delivery by natural AAV serotypes is limited by dose -limiting safety constraints and largely overlapping tropisms. AAV capsids engineered by rational design145,146,238,239 or directed evolution69,93,143,149,151,152,204,240 -243 have yielded vectors with improved efficiencies for select cell populations133,147,150,157,187,244,245, yet much work remains to identify a complete toolbox of efficient and specific vectors. Previously, we evolved the AAV -PHP.B and AAV -PHP.eB variants from AAV9 using a selection method called CREATE157. This method applies positive selecti ve pressure for capsids capable of infecting a target cell population by pairing a viral genome containing lox sites with in vivo selection in transgenic mice expressing Cre in the cell type of interest. This combination allows a Cre - Lox recombination -depe ndent PCR amplification of only those capsids which successfully deliver their genomes to the nuclei of the target cell type. To more efficiently expand the AAV toolbox, we developed Multiplexed -CREATE (M-CREATE) ( Figure 3.1a and Supplementary Fig ure. 3.S1a,b), which compares the enrichment profiles of thousands of capsid variants across multiple cell types and organs within a single experiment. This method improves upon its predecessor by capturing the breadth of capsid variants at every stage of the selec tion process. M -CREATE supports: (1) the calculation of an enrichment score for each variant by using next -generation sequencing (NGS) to correct for biases in viral production prior to selection, (2) reduced propagation of bias in successive rounds of sel ection through the creation of a post -round one synthetic pool library with equal variant representation , and (3) the reduction of false positives by including codon replicates of each selected variant in the pool. These improvements allow interpretation o f variants' relative infection efficiencies across a broad range of enrichments in multiple positive selections and enable post -hoc negative screening by comparing capsid libraries recovered from multiple target cell types or organs. Collectively, these fe atures allow prioritization of capsid variants for validation and characterization . 98 To demonstrate the ability of M -CREATE to reveal useful variants missed by its predecessor (CREATE), we used the capsid library design that yielded AAV -PHP.B, and identifie d several AAV9 variants with distinct tropisms including variants that have biased transduction of brain vascular cells or that can cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB) without mouse -strain specificity. 3.3 RESULTS 99 Figure 3.1: Workflow of M -CREATE and ana lysis of 7 -mer-i selection in round -1. (a), A multiplexed selection approach to identify capsids with specific and broad tropisms. Steps 1 -6 describe the workflow in round -1 (R1) selection, steps 7 -9 describe round -2 (R2) selection using the synthetic -pool method, steps 1a, 2a and 6a,b show the incorporation of deep sequencing to recover capsids after R1 and R2 selection, and steps 10-11 describe positive and/or negative selection criteria followed by variant characterization. The genes rep2 and cap9 in st ep 11 refers to rep from AAV2 100 and cap from AAV9, respectively, and the colored bar within cap9 represents the targeted mutation. (b), Structural model of the AAV9 capsid (PDB 3UX1) with the insertion site for the 7-mer-i library highlighted in red in the 6 0-meric (left), trimeric (middle) and monomeric (right) forms. (c), Empirical cumulative distribution frequency (ECDF) of R1 DNA and virus libraries that were recovered by deep sequencing post Gibson assembly and virus production, respectively. (d), Distri butions of variants recovered from three SNAP25 -Cre and GFAP -Cre brain tissue (n=2 per Cre line) are shown with capsid libraries, sorted by decreasing order of the enrichment score. The enrichment scores of the AAV -PHP.V2 variant are mapped as well. Analysis of capsid libraries during round -1 selection M-CREATE was developed to ena ble the analysis of capsid variants' behavior within and across in vivo selections. By doing so, we aimed to identify capsids with diverse tropisms, as well as reveal the capsid sequence diversity within a given tropism. M - CREATE achieves these aims by inc orporating NGS and a synthetic capsid library for round - 2 in vivo selection along with a dedicated analysis pipeline to assign capsid enrichment values. During DNA - and virus -library generation there is potential for biased accumulation and over -represent ation of certain capsid variants, obscuring their true enrichment during in vivo selection. These deviations may result from PCR amplification bias in the DNA library or sequence bias in the efficiency of virus production across various steps such as capsi d assembly, genome packaging and purification. We investigated this with a 7-mer-i (i for insertion) library, in which a randomized 7-amino acids (AA) library is inserted between AA 588 and 589 of AAV9 and theoretical library size, 3.4\u00d71010 unique nucleotide sequences, ~1\u00d7108 nucleotide transfection). We sequenced the libraries after DNA assem bly and after virus purification to a depth of 10 -20 million (M) reads, which was adequate to capture the bias among variants during virus production ( Figure 3.1c and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1b- d). The DNA library had a uniform distribution of 9.6M unique variants within ~10M total reads (read count (RC) mean=1.0, s.d. =0.074), indicating minimal bias. In contrast, 101 the virus library had 3.6M unique variants within ~20M depth (RC mean=4.59, s.d.=11.15) indicating enrichment of a subset of variants during viral production. Thus, even permissive sites like 588 -589 will impose biological constraints on sampled sequence space. For in vivo selection, we intravenously administered the 7-mer-i viral library in transgenic mice expressing Cre in astrocytes (GFAP -Cre), neurons (SNAP25 -Cre) or endothelial a dose 2\u00d71011 vector genomes (vg) per adult mouse ( n=2 mice per Cre transgenic line). Two weeks after intravenous (i.v.) injection, we collected brain, spinal -cord and liver tissues. We extracted the rAAV genomes from tissues and selectively amplified the capsids that transduced Cre -expressing cells ( Supplementary Figure deep sequencing, we observed ~8\u00d7104 unique nucleotide variants in brain tissue samples (~48% of wh ich were identified in the sequenced portion of the virus library) and <50 variants in spinal -cord samples across the transgenic lines, and each variant was represented with an enrichment score that reflects the change in relative abundance between the bra in and the starting virus library ( Methods and Figure 3.1d). Two features of this dataset stand out. First, the variants recovered from brain tissue were disproportionately represented in the sequenced fraction of the viral library, demonstrating how produ ction biases can skew selection results. Second, the distribution of capsid read counts reveals that more than half of the unique variants recovered after selection appear at low read counts. These variants may either have arisen spontaneously from errors during experimental manipulation or retain AAV9's basal levels of central nervous system (CNS) transduction ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1e). Unbiased round -2 library design improves the selection outcome Concerned that the sequence bias during viral productio n and recovery would propagate across selection rounds despite our post -hoc enrichment scoring, we designed an unbiased library based on the round -1 (R1) output (synthetic pool library) via 102 oligonucleotide pools. We compared this library with a library PCR amplified directly from the recovered R1 DNA (PCR pool library) ( Figure 3.2a and Table 3.T1). Table 3.T1: Comparison between the two methods for R2 selection. The table summarizes the pros and cons of selection design parameters by the synthetic pool and PCR pool R2 selection methods. Design Parameters Synthetic pool design PCR pool design Carryover of R1 selection bias among variants No, likelihood of false positives is low Yes, potential to minimize by normalization Carryover of R1 selection induced mutants No Yes Confidence in library performance High, using alternate codon replicates Low Customize library or add internal controls Yes, in an unbiased manner Yes, with greater risk of bias Control library size Yes, without reducing libraries or pooling Yes, with libraries reduced for pooling Cost for R2 library generation High Low 103 Figure 3.2: Round -2 capsid selections by synthetic pool and PCR pool methods.

For the high -confidence signal (below), a linear least -squares regression is determined between the two codons and the regression line (best fit). The coefficient of determination r2 is shown. (f), Heat maps representing the magnitude (log 2(fold change)) of a given amino acid's relative enrichm ent or depletion at each position given statistical significance is reached (boxed if P 0.0001, two -sided, two -proportion z-test, P values corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction). R2 DNA normalized to oligopool (top, ~9,000 sequen ces), R2 virus normalized to R2 DNA (middle, n=~9,000 sequences), R2 Tek brain library with enrichment over 0.3 (high -confidence signal) from synthetic pool method normalized to R2 virus (bottom, 154 sequences) are shown ( n=2 for brain library, one per mouse; all other libraries, n=1). (g), Heat map of Cre - independent relative enrichment across organs ( n=2 mice per Cre line, mean across 6 samples from 3 Cre lines is plotted) for variants enriched in the brain tissue of at least one Cre-dependent syn thetic pool selection (red text, n=2 mice per cell -type, mean is plotted) (left). Zoom -in of the most CNS -enriched variants (middle), and of the variants that are characterized in the current study along with spike -in library controls (right) are shown. The synthetic pool library design comprised: (1) equimolar amounts of ~8,950 capsid variants present at high read counts in at least one of the R1 selections from brain and spinal cord ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1e); (2) alternative codon replicates of thos e ~8,950 variants (optimized for mammalian to reduce false positives; and (3) a spike -in library of controls ( Supplementary Dataset 3.D1), resulting in a total library size of 18,000 nucleotide variants. AAV9 and ~50 additional variants (and their alternative codon duplicates), identified in previously described work133,157 (includes well characteri zed variants like AAV -PHP.B or AAV -PHP.eB as well as many variants identified using the previous methodology but uncharacterized in vivo ) act as internal selection controls and standards for the relative performance of the new variants (see Supplementary D ataset 3.D1). The PCR pool library was generated by pooling the amplicons from the R1 brain selections after normalization based on their relative diversity (see Methods ). 105 Both round -2 (R2) virus libraries produced a high titer (~6\u00d71011 vg per 10ng of R2 DNA library per 150 -mm dish; Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2a), and ~99% of variants of the R2 DNA were found after viral production ( Figure 3.2b). However, the distribution of the DNA and virus libraries from both designs differed notably. The PCR pool librar y carries forward the R1 selection biases ( Figure 3.2c and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2b,c) where the abundance reflects prior enrichment across tissues in R1 as well as bias from viral production and sample mixing. Comparatively, the synthetic pool DNA libra ry is more evenly distributed, minimizing bias amplification across selection rounds. For in vivo selection, we intravenously administered a dose of 1\u00d71012 vg per adult transgenic mouse into three of the previously used Cre lines ( n=2 mice per Cre transgenic line, GFAP, SNAP25, Tek), as well as the Syn -Cre line (for neurons). Two weeks after i.v. injection, we extracted, selectively amplified and deep -sequenced rAAV genomes from brain samples (as in R1). The synthetic pool library produced a greater number of enriched capsid variants than the PCR pool brain library (for example, ~1,700 versus ~700 variants per tissue library at the AA level in GFAP -Cre mice) ( Figure 3.2d and Supplementary Figure 3.S2d). In the synthetic pool, ~90% of the variants from the spike -in library were enriched ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2d, middle panel, and Supplementary Dat aset 3.D1). The degree of correlation between variant enrichment scores for PCR and synthetic pool libraries varies in each Cre transgenic line, indicating the presence of noise within experiments ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2e). Experimental noise The degre e of enrichment at which correlation breaks down appears to vary with Cre - line. A downside of PCR pool is that there is no way to tell whether it or synthetic pool is the more 'true' enrichment score, or even that there may be cause for concern regarding certain enrichment values. The correlation among positively enriched variants between the two methods were found to improve with the magnitude of positive enrichment. For each 106 experiment there is a level of enrichment below which the scores become irreprodu cible, or noisy. Supplementary Fig ure 3.S3a demonstrates that neither PCR pool nor Synthetic pool is inherently more 'true' at lower enrichment scores. This is because Synthetic pool methodology with its codon replicates has a self -contained control to de termine an enrichment level below which enrichment value has no further predictive power. In the main text we use the term 'noise' to refer to regions of enrichment in a particular experiment below which values lose their reproducibility and predictive pow er. Being able to experimentally determine enrichment signal above noise allows researchers to focus their attention and data analyses on enrichment levels that are internally reproducible and thereby avoid selecting false positive variants or drawing inva lid conclusions. Thus, if one is interested in only the highest enriched variants for a particular tissue, PCR pool design coupled with enrichment normalization to virus library may not drastically differ from synthetic pool design over one additional rou nd of selection for a subset of in vivo selections (such as Tek -Cre or SNAP -Cre). Without additional validation, however, it is difficult to predict whether a given in vivo system will perform akin to Tek - Cre. This becomes critical in a multiplexed selecti on study where target -specific variants may not garner the highest enrichments in one particular in vivo selection. The synthetic pool's codon -replicate feature addresses this predicament by pinpointing the level of enrichment needed within each selection to rise above noise (Figure 3.2e and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S3a,b). This is a substantial advantage over the PCR pool design, allowing us to confidently interpret enrichment scores in a given selection. Analysis of capsid libraries after round -2 selection s Whereas the amino acid distribution of the DNA library closely matched the Oligopool design, virus production selected for a motif within the hepta AA diversified 107 insertion (between AA 588 and AA 589), with Asn at position 2, -branched amino acids (I, T , V) at position 4 and positively charged amino acids (K, R) at position 5 (Figure 3.2f and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S3c). Fitness for BBB crossing resulted in a different pattern. For instance, variants highly enriched after recovery from brain tissue (acro ss all Cre lines) shared preferences for Pro in position 5, and Phe in position 6. By assessing enrichment score reproducibility within the synthetic pool design , we next determined the brain enriched variants' distribution across peripheral organs ( Figure 3.2g, left). About 60 variants that are highly enriched in brain are comparatively depleted across other organs ( Figure 3.2g, middle). Encouraged by the expected behavior of spike -in control variants (AAV9, PHP.B, PHP.eB), nts for further validation ( Figure 3.2g, right), including several that would have been overlooked if the choice had bee n based on PCR pool or CREATE ( Table 3.T2).

We noticed that the enriched variants cluster into distinct families based on sequenc e similarity. The most enriched variants form a distinct family across selections with a common motif: T in position 1, L in position 2, P in positive 5, F in position 6 and K or L in position 7 ( Figure 3.3a and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S3d). This amino acid pattern closely resembles the TLAVPFK motif in the previously identified variant AAV -PHP. B157. Given the sequence similarity among members of this family, we next tested whether selected va riants can cross the BBB and target the CNS with similar efficiency and tropism. The dominance of PHP.B -like motif The ability to twice recover the AAV -PHP.B sequence family from completely independently constructed and selected libraries confirms that the viral library's sequence space coverage was broad enough to recover a family of variants sharing a common motif. Unlike CREATE which identified only one variant, AAV -PHP.B, M -CREATE yielded a diverse PHP.B -like family that hints toward important chemical features of this motif. The sequence diversity within this family suggests that isolating AAV -PHP.B was not simply good fortune in our prior study (considering a theoretical starting library size of ~1.3 billion), and that this is a dominant family for thi s particular experiment. 109 Figure 3.3: Selected AAV capsids form sequence families and include variants for brain - wide transduction of vasculature.

AAV9 variants with enhanced BBB entry and CNS transduction Given the dominance of the PHP.B family in the R2 selection, we characterized its most enriched member, harboring a TALKPFL motif and henceforth referred to as AAV - PHP.V1 ( Figure 3.3a,b). Despite its sequence s imilarity to AAV.PHP.B, the tropism of AAV -PHP.V1 is biased toward transducing brain vascular cells ( Figure 3.3c and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S4a). When delivered intravenously, AAV -PHP.V1 carrying a fluorescent reporter under the control of the ubiquitous C AG promoter transduces ~60% of GLUT1+ cortical brain vasculature, compared with almost no transduction with AAV9 ( Figure 3.3c,d). In addition to PHP.V1 is not as efficient for astrocyte transduction as the previously reported AAV - PHP.eB (when packaged with an astr ocyte specific GfABC1D promoter132, Supplementary Fig ure requiring endothelial -cell-restricted transduction via i.v. delivery, AAV -PHP.V1 vectors can be used in three different systems: (1) in endothe lial- cell-type specific Tek -Cre246 mice with a Cre -dependent expression vector (Figure 3.3f (left), g and Supplementary Video 3.V1), (2) in fluorescent reporter mice where Cre is delivered with an endothelial -cell-type specific MiniPromoter (Ple261)129 (Figure 3.3f (right), h and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S4c-e) and (3) in wild -type mice by packaging a self -complementary genome (scAAV) containing a ubiquitous promoter (Supplementary Fig ure 3.4f). The mechanism of endothelial -cell-specific transductio n by AAV -PHP.V1 using scAAV genomes is unclear, but shifts in vector tropism when packaging scAAV genomes have b een reported for another capsid160. Given the difference in tropism between AAV -PHP.V1 and AAV -PHP.B or AAV - PHP.eB, we characterized several additional variants within the PHP.B -like family. One variant, AAV -PHP.V2, harboring the TTLKPFL 7-mer sequence and differing by only one amino acid from AAV -PHP.V1, has a similar tr opism ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S5). AAV-PHP.V2 capsid AAV -PHP.V2 was found at high abundance in R1 selection across all brain libraries and was highly enriched in R2 ( Figure 3.1d, 3.2g (right panel), 3.3a,b, Supplement ary Figure 3.S1e). Given its sequence similarity, we predicted similar tropism to that of AAV - PHP.V1. We validated this in vivo in -PHP.V2:CAG - mNeongreen genome, 3x1011 vg dose per adult mice, n = 3, Supplementary Fig ure 3.5a), in vg dose per adult mouse, n = 2, Supplementary Fig ure 3.S5b), and in GFAP \u00d7 1012 vg dose per adult mouse, n = 2, Supplementary Fig ure 3.S5c). Three other varian ts with sequences of roughly equal deviation from both AAV.PHP.V1 and AAV.PHP.B, AAV -PHP.B4 with TLQIPFK, and have PHP.B - 112 like tropism with biased transduction toward neurons and as trocytes ( Figure 3.4b and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S6a-c). Similar variants among the spike -in library, AAV - PHP.B5 with TLQLPFK and AAV -PHP.B6 with TLQQPFK, also shared this tropism (Figures 3.3b and 3.4a,b, Supplementary Fig ure 3.S6a). To evaluate the perfo rmance of the spike -in library, we chose two highly enriched variants similarly placed in sequence space: AAV -PHP.B6 - TLQLPFK and AAV -PHP.B7 - TLQQPFK ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2d (middle panel), 3.S3d) that were previously identified in the 3-mer-s PHP.B library133 but never validated in vivo . At a modest dose of 1x1011 vg in mice, 113 Figure 3.4: Characterization of round -2 brain libraries and identification of capsids with broad CNS tropism.

The dataset comprises a mean of two images per region per cell -type marker per mouse). We next investigated a ser ies of variants selected to verify M -CREATE's predictive power outside this family. A highly enriched variant with an unrelated sequence, AAV - PHP.C1 harboring RYQGDSV ( Figures 3.3a,b and 3.4a,b), transduced astrocytes at a similar efficiency and neurons at lower efficiency compared to other tested variants from the B family ( Figure 3.4b). Two variants found in high abundance in the R2 synthetic pool virus library and underrepresented in brain (with both codon replicates in agreement), AAV -PHP.X1 with ARQMDL S and AAV -PHP.X2 with TNKVGNI Figure 3.S2b, right), poorly CNS ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S6b). Two variants that we found in higher abundance in brain libraries from the PCR pool R2, AAV - PHP.X3 with QNVTKGV and AAV -PHP.X4 with L NAIKNI also failed to outperform AAV9 in the brain ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S6d). Collectively, our characterization of these AAV variants suggests several key points. First, within a diverse sequence family, there is room for both functional redundancy and the emergence of alternative tropisms. Second, highly enriched sequences outside the dominant family are also likely to possess enhanced function. Third, buoyed by codon replicate agreement in the synthetic pool, a variant's enrichment across tissues may be predictive. Fourth, while the synthetic pool R2 library contains a subset of the sequences that are in the PCR pool R2 and may thereby lack some enhanced variants, those variants found exclusively within the PCR pool library are more likely to be false positives. 115 The ability to confidently predict in vivo transduction from a pool of 18,000 nucleotide variants in R2 across multiple mice and Cre -lines is a substantial advance in the selection process and demonstrates the power of M -CREATE for the evolution of individual vectors. An AAV9 variant that specifically transduces neurons Using NGS, we re -investigated a 3-mer-s (s for substitution) PHP.B library generated by the prior CREATE methodology and that yielded AAV -PHP.eB133 (Figure 3.5a). Briefly, the re -investigated 3-mer-s PHP.B library diversified positions 587 -597 of the AAV -PHP.B capsid (equivalent of 587 -590 AA on AAV9) in portions of three consecutive AAs, (~40 ,000 total variants) ( Figure 3.4a). Selections were performed in three Cre for astrocytes. We deep sequenced the libraries recovered from brain (using Cre -dependent PCR) and a R2 library from the livers of wild -type mice (processed via PCR for all capsid sequences regardless of Cre -mediated inversion) and identified 150 -200 capsids enriched in brain tissue ( Figure 3.5b and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S7a,b). 116 Figure 3.5: Recovery of AAV -PHP.B variants inclu ding one with high specificity for neurons.

(b), Distributions of R2 brain and liver libraries (at the amino acid level) by enrichment score (normalized to R2 virus library, with variants sorted in decreasing order of enrichment score).

Variants that were enriched in brain and underrepresented in liver show a significant bias towards cer tain amino acids such as G, D and E at position 1; G and S at position 2 (which includes the AAV -PHP.eB motif, DG); and S, N and P at position 9, 10 and 11 (Figure 3.5c and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S7c; P 0.0001, two -sided, two -proportion z- test, P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction). We clustered variants that were enriched in the brain according to their sequence similarities and ranked them by their underreprese ntation in liver (represented by node size in clusters). A distinct family referred to as N emerged with the common motif SNP at positions 9 -11 in the PHP.B backbone ( Figure 3.5d and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S7d). The core variant of the N -family cluster, wi th the AQTLAVPFSNP motif, was highly abundant in R1 and R2 selections, had higher enrichment score in Vglut2 and Vgat brain tissues compared to GFAP, and was underrepresented in liver tissue ( Figure 3.5b and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S7a-d). Unlike AAV -PHP.eB , this variant (AAV -PHP.N) specifically transduced NeuN+ neurons even when packaged with a ubiquitous CAG promoter, although the transduction efficiency varied across brain regions (from ~10 -70% 118 in NeuN+ neurons, inhibitory neurons; Figure 3.5e,f and ure 3.S7e,f). Thus, by re -examining the 3-mer-s library we identified several useful variants, including one with notable cell -type-specific tropism. While Vglut2 -Cre and Vgat -Cre mice for in vivo selection, we didn't find variants that stood subtype -specific transduction of excitatory and inhibitory populations from our initial investigations on the NGS dataset. It is possible that a biological solution to this (stringent) selection was not present in this library. Investigation of capsid families beyond the C57BL/6J mouse strain The enhanced CNS tropism of AAV -PHP.eB and AAV -PHP.B relative to AAV9 is absent in a subset of mouse strains. Their transduction in SJL/J, with intermediate enhancement in 129S1/SvimJ, and no apparent enhancement over AAV9 in BALB/cJ and several additional strains134,164 -168. This pattern holds for the two variants from the PHP.B family that we characterized further, AAV -PHP.V1 and AAV -PHP.N ( Figure 3.6a and Table brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) culture, resulting in increased mean fluorescent intensity compared with that following AAV9 and AAV -PHP.eB transduction ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.

The data reported in (b) and (c) are from one experiment where all viruses were freshly prepared and titered in the same assay for dosage consistency. AAV - 121 PHP. C2 and AAV -PHP.C3 were further validated in an independent experiment for BALB/cJ, n=2 per group). Notably, M -CREATE revealed many non -PHP.B -like sequence families that enriched through selection for transduction of cells in the CNS. We tested the previ ously mentioned AAV -PHP.C1 (RYQGDSV), and (ERVGFAQ) ( Figure 3.6a). These showed enhanced BBB crossing irrespective of mouse strain, with roughly equal CNS transduction in BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J ( Figure 3.6c and Supplementary Fig ure 3.S8b). Collectively, these studies suggest that M -CREATE is capable of finding capsid variants with diverse mechanisms of BBB entry that do not exhibit strain specificity. 3.4 DISCUSSION This work outlines the development and validation of the M -CREATE platform for multiplexed viral capsid selection. M -CREATE incorporates multiple internal controls to monitor sequence progression, minimize bias and accelerate the discovery of capsid variants with useful tropisms. Utilizing M -CREATE, we ha ve identified both individual capsids and distinct families of capsids that are biased toward different cell -types of the adult brain when delivered intravenously. The outcome from 7 -mer-i selection demonstrates the possibility of finding AAV capsids with improved efficiency and specificity towards one or more cell types. Patterns of CNS infectivity across mouse strains suggest that M -CREATE may also identify capsids with distinct mechanisms of BBB crossing. With additional rounds of evolution as shown in t he 3-mer-s selection, the specificity or efficiency of 7 -mer-i library variants may be improved, as was observed with AAV -PHP.N or AAV -PHP.eB133. We believe that the variants tested in vivo and their families will find broad application in neuroscience, including studies involving the BBB247, neural -PHP.N are well -suited for studies requiring gene delivery for optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations86, or in rare 122 monogenic disorders (targeting brain endothelial cells, for example GLUT1 -deficiency syndrome, NLS1 -microcephaly249, or targeting neurons, for example mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC244). The outcomes from our experiments employing M-CREATE opens several promising lines of inquiry, such as the assessment of identified capsid families across species, the investigation of the mechanistic properties that underlie the ability to cross specific bar riers (such as the BBB) or target specific cell populations and further evolution of the identified variants for improved efficiency and specificity. In addition, the datasets generated by M -CREATE could be used as training sets for in silico selection by machine - learning models. M -CREATE is presently limited by the low throughput of vector characterization in vivo ; however, RNA -sequencing technologies250 offer hope in this regard. In summary, M -CREATE will serve as a next -generation capsid -selection platform that c an open directions in vector engineering and potentially broaden the AAV toolbox for various applications in science and in therapeutics. 3.5 METHODS Plasmids Library generation The le upon request at Caltech CLOVER Center) is a modification of the rAAV -Cap - in-cis-Lox plasmid157. For 7-mer-i library used the pCRII -9Cap - XE plasmid157 ( Supplementary Figure 3.S1a, plasmid available upon request at Caltech CLOVER Center) was modified from the AAV2/9 REP -AAP plasmid157. The rAAV -Cap-in-cis-Lox2 plasmid consists of three major elements that are flanked by AAV2 ITRs. 123 (i) UBC ubiquitous promoter driving the expression of fluorescent protein, mNeongreen, followed by a synthetic p olyadenylation sequence. The mCherry expression cassette of the previous version of the plasmid was replaced by mNeonGreen cassette. (ii) A portion of AAV2 rep gene that has the splicing sequences and promoter 716.1) followed by AAV9 The prior version of this plasmid, rAAV -Cap -in-cis-Lox, has a short 12 bp sequence between restriction sites XbaI and AgeI at AA 450 and 592 of the AAV9 Cap gene. This was replaced by a 723 bp sequence of mRuby2 gene in -frame (acts as filler DNA) in the newer version of the plasmid. (iii) SV40 polyadenylation sequence that is flanked by lox71 and lox66 sites. The minor changes were introduced to the prior version of the plasmid to facilitate ease of cloning and to visuali ze mammalian cell transfection. The Lox sites in these rAAV plasmids show modest levels of Cre -independent flipping. This was minimized during PCR -based capsid recovery by lowering the number of amplification cycles to a point where we cannot recover any r AAV capsids from the control DNA extracted from wild -type mice (i.e., lacking Cre expression) that were injected with the library. The pCRII -9Cap -XE plasmid contains the AAV9 capsid gene sequence AAs 450-592 and is flanked by XbaI and AgeI restriction sites. The AAV2/9 REP -AAP -Cap plasmid has the five previously existing stop codons of AAV2/9 REP -AAP in addition to the deletion of AAs 450 -592 of the AAV9 capsid sequence. These modifications did not affect vector production. The deletion of the overlap ping fragment between the REP -AAP and rAAV -Cap-in-cis-Lox2 plasmids minimizes recombination between plasmids that could potentially generate AAV9 wild - type capsids during co -transfection in vector production. Capsid characterization AAV capsids 124 The AAV ca psid variants with heptamer insertions or 11 -mer substitutions were between AA positions 587 -597 of the single -stranded (ss) -Globin (CAG) hybri d promoter N - and C -termini of EGFP and is driven by the CAG promoter. An equivalent version with one NLS is (ID 104061). 4052) consists of a EYFP gene built in the reverse direction of the CAG promoter, and it is flanked by a pair of Cre -Lox sites (Lox P and Lox 2272) on either ends. In cells expressing Cre, the Cre -lox pair inverts EYFP enabling transcription and translatio n, followed by excision in the lox site to prevent re-inversion. pAAV: N - and C -termini of mTurquoise2 and is driven by -cell- the expression iCre. pAAV:CAG -XFP (mNeongreen) for chara cterizing AAV of cell astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes, we use CAG -NLS -EGFP to restrict the expression to nucleus for easier 125 quantification using microscope images. GFAP -NLS -mTurq2 is used to quantify astrocytes. CAG -DIO-EYFP is used for Cre driver lines, due to the presence of lox sites in this plasmid. scAAV genomes To characterize the scAAV:CB6 -EGFP was a gift from G.

Using this strategy, we obtained combinations of all 20 amino acids at each position of the heptamer peptide using 33 codons, resulting in a theoretical library size of 1.28 billion at the level of amino acid combinations. The mutagenesis strategy for the 3 -mer-s PHP.B library is described in our prior work133. 126 Library cloning The 480 -bp AAV capsid f (450 -592 amino acids) with the randomized heptamer insertion between amino acids 588 and 589 was generated by conventional PCR methods using the pCRII -9Cap -XE157 template by Q5 Hot S tart High - Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB; M0494S) with forward primer, ( Table 3.T4). To avoid PCR -induced biases resulting from point mutations, recombination, and template switching, PCR amplification of the library was lim ited to 15 - 20 cycles and the reactions were scaled up to get the required yield. The resulting PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and extracted with a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery kit (Zymo Research; D4007). It is critical to avoid AAV contamination during this step by taking precautionary measures like using a clean gel -running box and freshly prepared 1\u00d7 TAE buffer. The rAAV -Cap -in-cis-Lox2 plasmid with the AgeI and XbaI, and the amplified library frag ment was assembled into the linearized vector at 1:2 molar ratio using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB; E2621S) by following the NEB recommended protocol. Primer name Sequence (5'-3') Forward or reverse direction Table 3.T4: Primers used in M -CREATE selection. The table provides a list of primers used in M -CREATE across the different steps of the selection proc ess as described in the Methods. Library purification The assembled library was then subjected to Plasmid Safe (PS) DNase I (Epicentre; E3105K) treatment, or alternatively, Exonuclease V M0345S) following the recommended protocols, to puri fy the assembled product by degrading the un - assembled DNA fragments from the mixture. The resulting mixture was purified with a PCR purification kit (DNA Clean and Concentrator kit, Zymo Research; D4013). Library yield With an assembly efficiency of 15 -20% post -PS treatment, we obtained a yield of about 15 -20ng per 100ng of input DNA per 20\u00b5L of assembly reaction. Quality control The following four steps were carried out to ensure successful capsid library generation. 1. To validate successful assembly of the library, 1 ng of the final assembled library was transformed into E. coli SURE 2 Supercompetent Cells (Integrated Sciences; 200152). We checked for colonies on an LB/Agar plate containing carbenicillin antibiotic after NGS -QC-R CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA Reverse 128 2. The DNA library was sequenced around the insertion site (Laragen; Sanger Sequencing). A non -biased library may match the diversity of the NNK/MNN motif (where N = 25% each of A, T, G, C; K = 50% each of G, T; M = 50% each of A, C) with some fluctuation s across the diversified region. 3. To verify that the ITRs were intact, SmaI digestion was carried out as per the NEB recommended protocol (NEB; R0141S). 4. To validate successful transfection and assess the vector -production yield per 150 mm dish, 10 n g of 7-mer-i library was used to transfect 293T producer cells (293T; ATCC CRL 3216). Uniform expression of mNeonGreen protein across HEK cells was observed, and an average yield of 0.1 - 1x1011 vg was obtained per 150 mm dish. Using the average yield per dish, we scaled up the vector production for in vivo selection (see Supplementary Figure 3.S2a). Round -2 AAV capsid DNA library PCR pool design To maintain proportionate pooling, we mathematically determined the fraction of each sample or library that need s to be pooled based on an individual library's diversity. This process involved estimation of the diversity precluding noise and consideration of amplification of this diversity across samples by determining the area under the curve for the interval of hi gh-confidence variants that falls in the higher RC range. We estimated the area under the curve (AUC) using the composite Simpson's rule by plotting all the recovered variants in a library (X -coordinate) to their read counts (RCs or copy number from deep s equencing data, Y -coordinate) (see Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1e). To determine the definite intervals for AUC, we sorted the data based on the decreasing order of the RCs. Noticeably, the distribution has two phases, with a steadier slope of variants in the higher RC range, followed by a steep drop in the slope of the curve (~50 -1000 fold lower RCs). By observation, this steeper side of the curve is predominant in sequencing 129 errors/ PCR mutations, hence we precluded this error dominant slope otherwise called noise from our AUC estimation. When comparing composite Simpson's rule with another function, such as composite trapezoidal rule, the difference was miniscule. This area is then used to determine the fraction of an individual library that needs to be pool ed into PCR pool library using the formula: [Area under the curve/ total number of libraries pooled]. The pooled sample was used as a template for further amplification with 12 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 20s and 72\u00b0C for 30s by Q5 polymerase, sing R1 library generation, product was assembled into the rAAV -Cap -in-cis-Lox2 plasmid and the virus was produced. The R1 libraries used to build R2 were the Cre -Lox flipped rAAV D NA from half of the mouse brains (~0.3 g) and portion of spinal cords (0.1 -0.2g) from all Cre lines. The amount of tissue processed here was sufficient for complete capsid library recovery. The differentially pooled and amplified libraries (by PCR pool or synthetic pool ) were assembled using Gibson assembly with a follow -up PS or Exonuclease V treatment (as described in R1 library generation). We validated successful library generation by transformation, Sanger sequencing, and an ITR SmaI digest. For vecto r production, about 10 ng of the purified and assembled library was used to transfect each 150 mm dish of 293T cells, and we obtained a yield of about 6\u00d71011 vg per 150 mm dish (i.e. , the R2 yield was six times that of R1, unsurprisingly given these sequen ces have already produced well enough to survive R1 selection). Synthetic pool design As described in the PCR pool strategy, we chose high -confidence variants whose RCs were above the error -dominant noise slope from the plot of library dist ribution (Supple mentary Fig ure 3.S1e). This came to about 9,000 sequences from all brain and 130 spinal -cord samples of all Cre lines. We used similar primer design as mentioned in the description of the R1 library generation. Primers XF and 11 -mer-588i ( Table 3.T4) were used. In 11 -mer-588i primer, 'XXXXXXMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNXXXXXX' was replaced with unique nucleotide sequence of a heptamer tissue recovered variant (7xMNN) along with modification of two adjacent codons flanking on either end of the heptamer insertion site (6xX), which are residues 587 'AQ' on -mer or 33 -base oligonucleotide mutated variants, we used the same primer design where 'XXXXXXMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNXXXXXX' was replaced with a specific nucleotide sequence of a 33-base oligonucleotide variant. A duplicate of each sequence in this library was designed with different codons optimized for mammals. The primers were designed using a custom -built Python based script. The custom -designed oligopool was synthesized in an equimolar ratio by Twist Biosciences. The oligopool was used to minimally amplify the pCRII -XE Cap9 template over 13 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 20s and 72\u00b0C for 30s. To obtain a higher yield for large -scale libr ary preparation, the product of the first PCR was used as a template for the second PCR using the primers XF and 588 -R2lib -R (described above) and minimally amplified for 13 cycles. Following PCR, we assembled the R2 synthetic pool DNA library and produced the virus as describ ed in R2 PCR pool design . AAV virus library production, purification and genome extraction To prevent capsid mosaic formation of the 7 -mer-i library in 293T producer cells, we transfected only 10ng of assembled library per 150 -mm di sh along with other required reagents for AAV vector production. In addition to the 10 ng of library transfection per 150 mm dish of 293T producer cells, we three plasmids: eins replication) at a ratio of 1:1:2. The plasmid pUC18 acts as a filler DNA to compensate for the low amount of library DNA in order to maintain 131 the N:P ratio required for optimal transfection using polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences; 24765 -1) transfection). The cells and culture media were harvested at 60 h post-transfection to collect the viral particles. rAAV harvest and purification were performed as per the protocol251. The small amount of library DNA per plate and early cell harvest time are critical for reducing the possibility of mosaic capsid assemblies during vector production (similar considerations seen in prior reports149,253,254). For 7-mer-i library, the production was sca led up to 60 dishes (~1.8x107 cells/dish) and with ~10% transfected with the library, resulted in ~1x108 total transformants. For an NNK 7 -mer library with total the is Bosley & Ostermeier ( 2005 )255, section 2.1.2 for mathematics). For the rAAV DNA extraction from purified rAAV viral library, ~10% of the purified viral library was used to extract the viral genome by proteinase K treat ment . In order to degrade any contaminating DNA from the purified library, it was treated with DNase I enzyme (5 \u00b5l of 10 U/\u00b5l) (Sigma -Aldrich; in 100 \u00b5l of DNase I buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The enzyme was inactivated by adding 5 \u00b5l of 0.5 M EDTA at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. Following DNase I treatment, the capsid protein shell was digested by adding 120 \u00b5l of proteinase solution containing 5 \u00b5l of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5l of pr oteinase K and incubated at 50\u00b0C overnight. To inactivate the proteinase K, the mixture was boiled at 95\u00b0C. The extracted rAAV library DNA was then concentrated and purified using phenol chloroform and ethanol. An equal volume of pH 8.0 (~250 \u00b5l; ThermoFisher Scientific; 15593031) was added and vortexed for 30 s. The mixture is incubated for 5 min at room temperature (RT) before centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The upper aqueous phase was separated a nd mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and vortexed for 30 s. Following 5 min incubation at RT, centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The upper aqueous phase was separated and one-tenth volume of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) along with 2 \u00b5l Co -Precipitant Pink (Bioline; BIO -37075) and 2.5 volumes of ice cold 100% ethanol was added before vortexing for 30 s. The mixture was incubated for at least 1 hr at -20\u00b0C before 132 centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was air dried and resusp ended in TE buffer. The DNA concentration was determined using the Qubit ssDNA assay. Animals All animal procedures performed in this study were approved by the California Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and we have complied with all relevant ethical regulations. lines used in this study were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). The i.v. injection of rAAVs was into the retro -orbital sinus of 6 - to 8-week -old male or female mi ce. For testing the transduction phenotypes of novel rAAVs, 6 - to 8-week -old, male C57BL/6J or Tek -Cre or Ai14 mice were randomly assigned. The experimenter was not blinded for any of the experiments performed in this study. In vivo selection The 7-mer-i viral library selections were carried out in different lines of Cre transgenic adult mice: Tek -Cre, SNAP25 -Cre and GFAP -Cre selections, and those three plus Syn1 -Cre for the R2 selections. Male and female mice, 6 - to 8-weeks -old, were i.v. admini stered with a viral vector dose of 2 \u00d7 1011 vg per mouse for the R1 selection, and a dose of 1 \u00d7 1012 vg per mouse for the R2 selection. The dose was determined on the basis of the virus yield, which was different across selection rounds (Supplementary Fig ure 3.S2a). Both genders were used to recover capsid variants with minimal gender bias. Two weeks' post-injection, mice were euthanized and all organs including brain were collected, snap frozen on dry ice , and stored at 80\u00b0C. rAAV genome extraction from tissue Optimization 133 For rAAV genome extraction from tissues, we used both the Trizol method (Life Technologies; 15596) and the QIAprep (Qiagen, Inc; 27104) according to the manufacturers' recommended protocols, and found the Trizol metho d to be more efficient (see Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1f,g,i ). The total rAAV genome recovery from 0.1 g of mouse liver was quantified by quantitative PCR using the primers mNeonGreen -F and mNeonGreen -R, of the ssAAV -Cap-in-cis-Lox2 genome (see Table 3.T4). As an internal control, we also quantified the amount of mitochondrial DNA (a surrogate for the recovery of circular, episomal genomes) using primers Mito -F and Mito -R (see Table 3.T4). Although the percentage of viral D NA per 1 ng total extracted DNA was about 1.5 fold higher with the QIAprep kit than with the Trizol method, the overall recovery was lower with the QIAprep kit. The extracted viral genome was digested with a restriction enzyme, such as SmaI (found within t he ITRs), as it appeared to help improve rAAV genome recovery by PCR with ~4 fold change (see Supplementary Fig. 1h, CT ~ 2, 1 CT = 2 -fold difference in DNA copies, fold change = (2CT) = 4). This was analyzed by quantitative PCR with Cre primers, CapF -56 and Cre 3.T4). rAAV genome extraction with the Trizol method Half of a frozen brain hemisphere (0.3g approx.) was homogenized with a 2mL glass homogenizer (Sigma D8938) motorized plastic pestle (Fisher Scientific; 12-141-361, (1.5-3.0mm zirconium or steel Scientific, D1032 -15, D1032 -30, D1033 -28) and processed using Trizol as described in o ur prior work157. The extracted DNA by Trizol method was then treated with 3 -6\u00b5L RNase Cocktail Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific; AM2286) to remove RNA. The mixture was als o digested with SmaI restriction enzyme to improve rAAV genome recovery by PCR ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1h). The treated mixture was then finally purified with a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit 134 (D4033). From deep -sequencing data analysis, we observed t hat the amount of tissue processed was sufficient for rAAV genome recovery. rAAV genomes with Lox sites flipped by Cre recombination were selectively recovered and amplified using PCR with primers that yield a PCR product only if the Lox sites are flipped ( Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1b). We used the primers 71F and CDF/R and amplified the Cre -recombined genomes over 25 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 58\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 1min, using Q5 DNA polymerase (Table 3.T4). Total rAAV genome by PCR (Cre -independent) To recover all rAAV genomes from a tissue, we used the primers XF and 588 -R2lib - R to amplify the genomes over 25 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 30min, using Q5 DNA polymerase ( Tabl e 3.T4). Sample preparation for NGS We processed the DNA library, the virus library and the tissue libraries following in vivo selection to add flow cell adaptors around the diversified hepta mer insertion region (Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1b). Preparation of rAAV DNA and viral DNA library The Gibson -assembled rAAV DNA library and the DNA extracted from the viral library were amplified by Q5 DNA polymerase using the primers 588i -lib-PCR1 -6bpUID - F and 588i -lib-PCR1 -R are positioned around 50 bases from the randomized hepta mer insertion on the capsid, and that contain the Read1 and Read2 flow cell sequences on the 5 to minimally amplify DNA an d virus libraries for NGS has 6 nucleotides long UID 135 (unique identifier) \"NNNNNN\" that sits after 19 nucleotides of Read -1 sequence used in NGS \"5' -CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT\" and linker \"AA\". The sequence after UID \"AGTCCTATGGACAAGTGGCCACA\" is the region that an neals to the AAV9 capsid. UID is an optional feature for NGS data analysis to identify potential PCR amplification errors. However, this feature wasn't utilized in the NGS data analysis in this study to maintain consistency with the primers used in rAAV ge nome recovery from tissues which lacks this UID feature (primers 71F and CDF/R, See Table 3.T4). The UID or any kind of overhangs seemed to affect the PCR based recovery from tissue. Presumably, the primer thermostability have a key role to play in very lo w amount of extracted rAAV genomes from tissues. Using 5 -10ng of template DNA in a 50\u00b5L reaction, the DNA was minimally amplified for 4 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 10s. The mixture was then purified with a PCR purification kit. The eluted DNA was then used as a template in a second PCR to add the unique indices (single or dual) via the recommended primers (NEB; E7335S, E7500S, E7600S) in a 12 -cycle reaction using the same temperature cycle as described above. The samples were then sent for deep sequencing following additional processing and va lidation . The PCR products post indices addition were run on a freshly prepared 2% low - melting -point agarose gel (ThermoFisher Scientific; 16520050) for better separation and recovery of the approx. 120 bp DNA band on the gel. Before send ing the sample for NGS, the nucleotide diversity at the randomized 7 -mer position was verified by Sanger sequencing. If needed, an optional PCR was carried out to send sufficient sample for Sanger sequencing using 15 - 20 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s with the primers NGS -QC-F and NGS -QC-R (see Table 3.T4). Upon validation, the libraries were sent for deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System (Millard Laboratory, Caltech; Integra tive Genomics Core, City of Hope). Preparation of rAAV tissue DNA library 136 The PCR -amplified rAAV DNA library from tissue (see sections: by Cre -dependent PCR and genome recovery by PCR (Cre - independent) ) was further amplified with a 1:100 dilution of this DNA as a template to the primers 1527 and 1532 that are positioned around 50 bases from the randomized hepta mer insertion on the capsid, and that contain the Read1 and Read2 sequences on the 5' end (see Table 3.T4). The DNA w as amplified by Q5 DNA polymerase for 10 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10s, 59\u00b0C for 30s, and 72\u00b0C for 10s. The mixture was purified with a PCR purification kit. The eluted DNA was then used as a template in a second PCR to add the unique indices (single or dua l) using the recommended primers (NEB; E7335S, E7500S, E7600S) in a ten-cycle reaction with the same temperature cycle as described above (for DNA and virus library preparation), and followed additional processing a nd validation before sequencing. The PCR products post indices addition were run on a freshly prepared 2% low - melting -point agarose gel (ThermoFisher Scientific; 16520050) for better separation and recovery of the approx. 120 bp DNA band on the gel. Before sending the sample for NGS, the nucleoti de diversity at the randomized 7 -mer position was verified by Sanger sequencing. If needed, an optional PCR was carried out to send sufficient sample for Sanger sequencing using 15 - 20 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s with the pri mers NGS -QC-F and NGS -QC-R (see Table 3.T4). Upon validation, the libraries were sent for deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System (Millard Genetics and Genomics Laboratory, Caltech; Integrative Genomics Core, City of Hope). In vivo characterization of AAV vectors Cloning AAV capsid variants The capsid -PHP.B ID: 103002) reverse primers with 11 -base oligonucleotide substitution (in case of 7-mer-i variants, the flanking amino acids from AAV9 capsid AA 587 -588 'AQ' and AA 589 -590 'AQ' were subjected to codon 137 modification) that spans from the MscI site (at position 581 AA) to the AgeI site (at position 600 AA) on the pUCmini plasmid. The pr imers were designed for all capsid variants using a custom Python script and cloned using standard molecular techniques. The designed primers cover the entire fragment that is inserted into the linearized pUCmini - iCAP -PHP.B backbone. Hence these primers ar e simply self -annealed using PCR to synthesize double -stranded DNA fragment without the use of a template DNA. They are amplified by Q5 Hot Start High -Fidelity 2X Master Mix for 20 cycles of 9 8\u00b0C for 10s, 60\u00b0C for 30s and 72\u00b0C for 10s. This fragment was then assembled into the MscI/AgeI digested pUCmini -iCAP -PHP.B backbone by the Gibson assembly method. There is a second MscI site on the backbone; however, this was blocked by methylation. The assembled plasmids were then transformed into NEB Stable competent E. coli (New England Biolabs; C3040H), and colonies were selected on carbenicillin/ampicillin -LB agar plates. A list of primers used AAV -PHP variants is provided ( Table 3.T5). 138 Table 3.T5: Sequence motifs of AAV -PHP variants The table pro vides the sequence motif information for all the new AAV -PHP variants identified in this study, and the primer information to clone them into pUCmini -iCAP -PHP.B Variant Name Amino of Methods. The variants from 7-mer-i and 3-mer-s libraries were cloned as 11 -mer substitution. AAV vector production Using an optimized protocol134 (Chapter 2 in thesis ), we produced AAV vectors from 5-10 150 -mm plates, which yielded sufficient amounts for administration to adult mice. AAV vector administration, dosage and expression time AAV vectors were administered intravenously to adult male mice (6 -8 weeks of age) via retro -orbital injecti on at doses of 1\u00d71011-10\u00d71011 vg with 3 -4 weeks of in vivo expression times unless mentioned otherwise in the figures or legends . The AAV doses are determined by the experimental needs. CAG -NLS -GFP related experiments for quantification were done at me dium dose of 1x1011 vg given this was the dose previously determined for AAV -PHP.eB characterization. Otherwise, the non -NLS genome related experiments were done at 3x1011 vg, with the exception of Cre -driver lines (GFAP -Cre or Tek -Cre), or a h promoter containing genome (GFAP -NLS - mTurq) where the dose was 1x1012 vg. The high dose was chosen to understand the full potential of the new vectors in these systems. All experiments with vectors carrying CAG, a strong ubiquitous promoter, were incubat ed for 3 weeks. The 4 week incubations are those that involved expression from Cre driver lines or cell -type specific promoter where it is generally recommended for a longer wait time. The 2 week incubations are those where the vectors carried self -complem entary genomes with strong ubiquitous promoters. Tissue processing After 3 weeks of expression (unless noted otherwise), the mice were anesthetized with Euthasol (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium solution, Virbac -50mL of 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), 140 by 30 -50ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS. After this procedure, all organs were harvested and post -fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight. The tissues were then washed and stor ed at 4\u00b0C in 0.1M PBS and 0.05% sodium azide. All solutions used for this procedure were freshly prepared. For the brain and liver, 100 -\u00b5m thick sections were cut on a Leica VT1200 vibratome. For vascular labeling, the mice were transcar dially perfused with 20mL of ice -cold PBS, followed by 10mL of ice placed of ice -cold 4% PFA for fixation. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed on 100 -\u00b5m-thick tissue sections to label different cell -type markers such NeuN Millipore Sigma, 07 -1401) for brain endothelial cells using optimized p rotocols . Tissue sections, typically 100 -\u00b5m thick, were first incubated in blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X -100, and 0.01% sodium azide in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4) with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions for 24 h at RT on a rocker. The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit S100 07 -1401). After primary antibody incubation, the tissues were washed 1 - 3 times with wash buffer 1 (0.1% Triton X -100 in 0.1 M PBS buffer, pH 7.4) over a period of 5 - 6 h in total. The tissues were then incubated in blocking buffer with the secondary antibodies at appropriate dilutions for 12 - 24 h at RT and then washed in three times in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 over a total duration of 5 - 6 h. The secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure donkey anti -rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson dihydrochloride d at a 1:1000 dilution in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 and incubated with tissues for 15 minutes followed by a single wash for 10 minutes in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. The DAPI and/or antibody -stained tissue sections were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Therm oFisher Scientific, P36970). Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) -based RNA labeling in tissues Fluorescence in situ hybridization chain reaction (FITC -HCR) was used to label excitatory neurons with VGLUT1 and inhibitory neurons with GAD1 to characterize the AAV capsid variant AAV -PHP.N in brain tissue using an adapted third -generation HCR260 protocol . To characterize the AAV capsid variant AAV -PHP.N in brain tissue, HCR method was sought to label excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization chain reaction (FITC -HCR) was used to label excitatory neurons with VGLUT1 and inhibitory neurons with GAD1. Adapting the third -generation HCR260, we designed 13 probe sets for each target by using custom -made software (https://github.com/GradinaruLab/HCRprobe ). After 3 weeks of expression, the mice were transcardially perfused and fixed as described earlier (Section D. Tissue processing). To minimize RNase enzyme exposure in fixed tissues, following overnight fixation in 4% PFA, the tissues were washed and stored at 4\u00b0C in 0.1 M RNase -free PBS and 0.05% sodium azide. The harvested brains were henceforth handled with care to avoid exposure to RNase using reagents such brains were sagittally sliced to 100 -\u00b5m thick sections, we performed FITC -HCR to detect both genes. We permeabilized tissue slices with 0.1% Triton X -100 in 0.1 M RNase -free PBS for 1 h at RT and pre -hybridized them in hybridization solution (10% dextran sulfate -sodium citrate)) for >30 min at 37oC. The designed probes were diluted in 142 hybridiza tion solution to get a final concentration of 2 nM. The tissue sections were then subjected to hybridization with the probes overnight at 37oC. Following this, the sections were washed with pre -warmed wash buffer (10% ethylene carbonate in 2xSSC) at 37oC for 30 min twice, followed by 2xSSC at RT for 30 min twice. Amplification with hairpin pairs (Molecular Technologies, CA) were performed in amplification buffer (10x dextran sulfate in 2xSSC); hairpins were snap -cooled at 95oC for 90 s, followed by RT for 30 min, and diluted with amplification buffer (60 nM). Tissues were then incubated in this amplification buffer with hairpins overnight at RT with gentle agitation. Once the amplification was done, samples were briefly washed with 2xSSC and mounted in Prolo ng Diamond for imaging. Imaging and image processing All images in this study were acquired either with a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope using the Plan and Plan -Apochromat \u00d725 0.8 Imm Corr DIC M27 multi - immersion; or with a Keyence BZ -X700 microscope . To prevent any imaging artifacts resulting from multiple fluorescence spectral overlap, the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were kept distinct following the recommended linear unmixed acquisition of individual colors. A far -red fluorescent dye was chosen for any additional marker staining to keep the imaging parameters distinct from in vivo fluorescent expression thereby preventing any spectral overlap across dete ctor channels. The tissues were routinely monitored for auto fluorescence or imaging artifacts before acquisition, and imaging parameters were adjusted if needed. The imaging parameters were cross -checked with tissues lacking in vivo transduction to avoid any imaging artifacts. The regions used for the images were closely matched across experimental groups to minimize bias during comparisons. The acquired images were processed in the respective microscope software Zen Black 2.3 SP1 (Zeiss), BZ -X Analyzer (K (BZ-H3C), ImageJ, Imaris (Bitplane) and with Photoshop CC 2018 (Adobe). The images were compiled in Illustrator CC 2018 (Adobe). Tissue clearing Brain hemispheres were cleared using iDISCO261 method and tissues over 500\u00b5m thickness were optically cleared using ScaleS4(0)170. To demonstrate the ability of PHP.V1 to transduce the vasculature across thick tissues, such as a mouse -brain hemisphere, we assessed tissue from Tek -Cre mice 4 weeks' post administration. The brain hemisphere was stained with the primary antibody, Anti - GFP (1:200, Aves Labs, GFP -1020), and the secondary anti -Chicken IgY, Alexa Fluor 633 (1:200, ThermoFisher Scientific, A -21103), and cleared via the iDISCO protocol261. For imaging, a commercial light -sheet microscope (Lavision BioTec) with a custom objective lens (4\u00d7) was used262. The resulting image files were reorganized by a custom MATLAB script to allow stitching with TeraStitcher263. For 3 -D visualization, Imaris (Bitplane) was used. For images of peripheral organs such as heart, muscle, spleen that were over 500 microns in thickness, optical clearing was performed by incubating the tissues in 5 ml of Scale S4(0)170 solution overnig ht at RT with gentle agitation, then mounted the tissues in fresh Scale S4(0) solution and imaged under the confocal microscope. Tissue processing and imaging for quantification of rAAV transduction in vivo For quantification of rAAV transduction, 6 - to 8-week -old male mice were i.v. injected with the virus, which was allowed to express for 3 weeks (unless specified otherwise). The mice were randomly assigned to groups and the experimenter was not blinded. The mice were perfused and the organs were fixed in PFA. The brains and livers were cut into 100 -\u00b5m-thick sections and immunostained with different cell -type-specific antibodies, as described above. The images were acquired either with a \u00d725 objective on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope or with a Keyenc e BZ -X700 microscope; images that 144 were compared directly across groups were acquired and processed with the same microscope and settings . For quantification of PHP.B -family variant transduction in tissues, the images were acquired using 25x objective with 1x digital zoom on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. With n=3 mice per variant, images were acquired across 4 brain regions - cortex, striatum, ventral midbrain and thalamus and tissues were stained with 3 cell type markers (NeuN, Olig2, and S100). For each mouse, 2 images per brain region per cell type marker were acquired, and the mean were plotted. For PHP.N transduction analysis, the images were acquired using 20x objective on Keyence BZ -X700 microscope. With n=3 mice, across regions - cortex, striatum, ventral midbrain and thalamus were acquired to cover the entire brain regions for 3 cell type markers (NeuN, Olig2, and S100). This involved 6 -8 images to cover cortex, thalamus and striatum, and 2 images to cover ventral midbrain per mo use per cell -type marker. For each mouse, across each region, the mean from the images were plotted. For PHP.V GLUT1+ transduction analysis, the images were acquired using 25x objective with 1x digital zoom on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. Each dist inct blood vessel in the image with GLUT1+ staining and XFP expression was determined as positive for transduction. Quantification of expression from the CAG -mNeonGreen vector was performed across the cortex (n = 3 per group). Each data point is drawn from the mean of 3-2 images per mouse. Different brain regions were quantified for Tek -Cre and Ai14 mouse experiments with n = 2 per group. For cortex, cerebellum, striatum , and ventral midbrain, the mean was plotted from 3 -4 images per mouse per region. In vi tro characterization of AAV vectors Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) (ScienCell Research Laboratories, cat. no. 1000) were cultured as per the instructions provided by the vendor. HBMEC were cultured from a frozen stock vial in fibronect in-coated T -75 flask (7,000 - 145 9,000 cells per cm2 seeding density) using the endothelial cell medium (cat. no. 1001). The cells were subcultured in fibronectin -coated 48 -well plates (0.95cm2 growth area) at the recommended seeding density and incubated at 3 7\u00b0C for ~24 -48h until the cells were completely adherent with ~70 -80% confluence. The viral vectors packaging pAAV:CAG - mNeongreen were added to the cell culture at a dose of either 1\u00d7108 or 1\u00d71010 vg per well (3 wells per dose per vector). The medium was changed 24h later, and the culture was assessed for fluorescence expression at 3 d post infection. Per vendor recommendation, the culture medium was changed every other day to maintain the cell culture. Data analysis Quantification of rAAV vector tra nsduction Manual counting was performed with the Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 Count Tool for cell types in which expression and/or antibody staining covered the whole cell morphology. The Keyence Hybrid Cell Count software (BZ -H3C) was used where the software c ould reliably detect distinct cells in an entire dataset. To maintain consistency in counting across different markers and groups, one person was assigned to quantify across all groups in all brain areas . Manual counting was performed for GLUT -1-stained bl ood vessels and expression of the ssAAV:CAG -mNeonGreen and ssAAV:CAG -DIO-EYFP, where the efficiency was calculated as the percentage of XFP+ vessels relative to the GLUT -1 staining. Manual counting was also performed to quantify nuclear or soma stained cel ls, including NeuN -, Olig2 -, and S100 -stained cells. The efficiency was calculated as the percentage of XFP+ cells relative to cell -marker+ cells. Keyence Hybrid Cell Count software (BZ -H3C) was used to quantify expression of nuclear localized AAV genomes in liver hepatocytes that co -localized with the DNA stain, DAPI; and also for the study involving ssAAV:GFAP -2xNLS -mTurquoise2 genomes with S100 cell marker. 146 The mean fluorescence intensity across microscopic images were quantified using ImageJ software. The images were processed for background subtraction and using the Threshold operation, the mean fluorescence intensity was measured. The experimenter was not blinded during data analysis. NGS data alignment and processing The raw fastq files from NGS runs were processed with custom -built scripts that align the data to AAV9 template DNA fragment containing the diversified region 7xNNK (for R1) or 11xNNN (for R2 since it was synthesized as 11xNNN) . The pipeline to process these datasets involved filtering t he dataset to remove the low-quality reads by using the deep sequencing quality score for each sequence. The variant sequences were then recovered from the sequencing reads by searching for the flanking template sequences, and extracting the nucleotides of the diversified region (perfect string match algorithm). The quality of the aligned data was further investigated to remove any erroneous sequences (such as ones with stop codons). The raw data was plotted (as shown in Supplementary Fig ure 3.S1e) to study the quality of recovery across every library. Based on the RC distribution, we adapted a thresholding method to remove plausible erroneous mutants that may have resulted from PCR or NGS based errors. The assumption is that if there is a PCR mutation or NG S error on the recovered parent sequence, the parent must have existed at least one round earlier than the erroneous sequence, and thus a difference in RCs should exist. For R1 tissue libraries, we observed a steep drop in the slope of the distribution cu rve following a long tail of low count sequences, and were found to be rich in sequences that are variations of the parents in the higher counts range. We manually setup a threshold for RCs to remove such erroneous mutants. The thresholded data were then p rocessed differently based on the experimental needs as described elsewhere using custom Python based scripts. 147 For R2 tissue libraries from PCR pool and synthetic pool , given the smaller library size compared to R1, we thresholded the data in two steps. We only considered the tissue recovered sequences that were present in the respective input DNA and virus library (after removing lower count variants from input libraries following the same principle as R1 tissue libraries). This step partially removed the long tail of low count reads. As a second step, we applied the thresholding that was described for R1 tissue libraries. While it is plausible that true variants may be lost during thresholding, this method minimized false positives as the low count mutant s in tissue and virus libraries often seemed to have very high enrichment score (as RCs are normalized to input library). In other words, thresholding allowed selective investigation on enriched variants that had a higher -confidence in their NGS RCs. As a n alternative to our manual thresholding method, an optional error correction method called \"Collapsing\" was built to further validate the outcome from filtered datasets. This method starts at the lowest count variants (variants of count 1) and searches fo r potential parent variants that are off by one nucleotide but have at least 2 -fold higher counts (fold change = (2CT) where CT is PCR cycle threshold). This error correction method then transfers the counts of these potential erroneous sequences to their originating sequences and repeats recursively until all sequences have been considered. On applying this error correction to our thresholded data, an additional ~0.002 -0.03% of sequences were captured (compared to >19% captured by thresholding), confirming that our thresholding strategy was largely successful. NGS data analysis The aligned data were then further proce ssed via a custom data -processing pipeline, with scripts written in Python. The enrichment scores of variants (total, N) across different libraries were calculated from the read counts (RCs) according to the following formula: 148 Enrichment score=log 10((variant 1 RC in tissue library1 / sum of variants N RC in library1) / (variant 1 RC in virus library / sum of variants N RC in virus library)) To consistently represent library recovery between R1 and R2 selected variants, we estimated the enrichment score of the variants in R1 selection . Since the DNA and virus libraries were not completely sampled unlike the tissue libraries, we assigned an estimated RC for variants that were not present in the input library but were present in the output library. For instance, R1 virus library is the input library to the R1 tissue libraries. The estimated RC is defined as a number that is lower than the lowest RC in the library with the assumption that these variants were found at a relatively lower abundance than the variants recovered from the deep sequencing. In virus libraries, since RC of 1.0 was the lowest, we assigned all missing variants an estimated RC of 0.9. We use this method to calculate the enrichment score of the R1 tissue librarie s which is normalized to R1 virus library ( Figure 3.1d). This was done to represent libraries across two selection rounds consistently. Although, the individual enrichment score among R1 variants didn't add a significant value to the variants selected for R2 selection as described in the criteria to separate signal vs noise in R1 using the RCs. The standard score of variants in a specific library was calculated using this formula: Standard score=(read count_i - mean) / s.d. Read count_i is raw copy number of a variant i. Mean is the mean of read counts of all variants across a specific library. The s.d. is the s.d. of read counts of all variants across a specific library. The plots generated in this article were using the following software: Plotly, GraphP ad PRISM structure (PDB 3UX1)264 was modeled in PyMOL. Heat map generation 149 The relative amino acid distributions of the diversified regions are plotted as heat maps. The plots were generated using the Python Plotly plotting library. The heat map values were genera ted from custom scripts written in Python, using functions in the custom \"pepars\" Python package . Each heatmap uses both an expected (input) distribution of amino acid sequences and an output distribution. The output distribution must be a list of sequenc es and their count, and the input distribution can be either a list of sequences and their count, or an expected amino acid frequency from a template, such as NNK. For both input and output, the total count of amino acids in each position is tallied in acc ordance to each sequence's count and then divided by the total sum of counts, giving a frequency of each amino acid at each position. Then, the log2 fold change is calculated between the output and the input. For amino acids with a count of 0 in either the input or output, no calculation is performed. In order to distinguish between statistically significant amino acid biases, a statistical test was performed using the statsmodels Python library. For the case where there are two amino acid counts, a two -sided, two -proportion z -test was performed; for comparing the output amino acid count to an expected input frequency from a template, a one -proportion z-test was performed. All p -values were then corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Only bias differences below a significance threshold of 1e -4 are then outlined on the heatmap; all other (insignificant) squares are left empty. Clustering analysis Using custom scripts written in MATLAB (version R2017b; MathWorks), we determined the reve rse Hamming distances representing the number of shared amino acids between two peptides. Cytoscape (version 3.7.1265) software was then used to cluster the variants. The amino acid frequency plot representing the highlighted cluster was created using Weblogo (Version 2.8.2)266,267. The reverse Hamming distances (representing the number of shared AAs between two peptides) was determined for all unique capsid variants with greater than 10 count and 150 greater than 2.5 -fold enrichment after R2 selection. This process iterati vely compares each variant with all other variants within the group. Capsid variants were then clustered by their reverse Hamming distances using Cytoscape. The minimum reverse Hamming distance for visualization was chosen manually based on sequence simila rity. For the amino acid frequency plots, the number on the bottom represents the position of the diversified motif starting from 1. The size of the amino acid in the stack reflects the proportion of unique clones in which the AA appears at that specific p osition in the motif. The color code is based on the AA properties. The positively charged residues K, R, and H are in blue. The negatively charged residues D and E are in red. The amide containing polar residues Q, and N are in magenta. The polar residues T, and S, are in green. The hydrophobic residues A, L, V, I, P, F, M, and W are in black. Statistics and reproducibility Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad PRISM or Python scripts. All correlation analyses reported were carried out using a li near least -squares regression method by an inbuilt Python function from SciPy library 'scipy.stats.linregress', and the coefficient of determination ( R2) is reported. Tests evaluating the significance of amino acid bias were done using statsmodels Python l ibrary. A one -proportion z-test for a library versus known template frequency (NNK), and two -proportion z-test for two -library comparisons were performed. P values are corrected for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni correction. For datasets with two experimental group comparisons, a Mann - Whitney test was used and two -tailed exact P values are reported. For more than two experimental group comparisons with one variable, a one -way ANOVA non -parametric Kruskal -Wallis test with multiple comparisons using uncorrected Dunn's test was performed. Exact P values are reported from both tests (unless indicated otherwise). For experimental group comparisons with two variables, a two -way ANOVA with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons reporting corrected P values were performed with 95% CI. 151 All quantitative data reported in graphs are from biological replicates (mouse or tissue culture replicates), where each data point from a biological replicate is the mean from technical replicates (raw data such as images of a specific brain region). Statistical analyses were performed on datasets with at least three biological replicates. Error bars in the figures denote s.e.m. All experiments were validated in more than one independent trial unless otherwise noted.

For instance, there ar e no good AAV vectors for targeting other widely studied CNS cell types such as microglia or oligodendrocyte by intravenous delivery39,268,269. In addition, there is room for further improvement of the AAV -PHP vectors ' efficiency and specificity, especially for AAV -PHP.C -like variants that may have the potential for translation across species. With the M-CREATE method in place, we can now push forward to apply similar parallel selections across other cell types of interest such as the peripheral nervous system. Although CREATE selected AAV -PHP.S vector from GFAP -Cre (astrocyte) selection, and is used for application s requiring gene delivery to sensory and enteric nervous system134,270, there is room for improving the selection using M -CREATE with the hope to find vectors with higher efficiency and specificity. And one could expand this further to do similar selections to obtain cell -type or organ specific variants, provided there are Cre transgenic lines that are highly specific to the cell population s of interest. Often times, this may not be feasible , and may require alternate strategies to supplement for the loss of selection pressures across different biologi cal systems, or even require additional rounds of evolution , or rational or semi rational designs to achieve the desired vector properties. 165 4.2 INVESTIGATION OF MECHANISM OF ENGINEERED VECTORS While the directed evolution approach is very promising to yield the vectors w ith desired properties, understanding mechanism of how these vectors gain entry to cell types of interest can eventually allow us to understand how these vectors may perform across species. For instance, AAV -PHP.B vectors that performed really well in sele ct strains in rodents uses a cell surface protein receptor, ly6a, the homolog of which is not seen in humans164,165,167,271. This is a very useful information to the community who would invest in the possibility of translation of such vectors in gene therapy applications. The engineered AAV -PHP.C variants identified by M -CRE ATE have distinct amino acid signatures. This opens up the possibility that they may act on different cell surface protein receptors , or in other words , may have different mechanisms of entry into cells, and this may or may not necessarily coincide across species . Hence for translation purposes, studies similar to the ones conducted to identify ly6a would be very useful to make an informed decision on the choice of the AAV -PHP.C vector s for translation. In addition to the protein target identificat ion, we could also make progress towards understand ing the kinetics of vector biodistribution in vivo using new imaging modalities such as PET (positron emission tomography )272 than the traditional methods involving quantification of viral genomes or expression of a protein over time . 4.3 DEVELOPMENT OF TEC HNOLOGIES TO EMPOWER M -CREATE While M -CREATE speeds up the selection process and the possible outcomes from a given experiment, this method is hit by the bottleneck of characterizing individual variants in vivo . Given the high yield of enriched variants o r families of variants that may all be interesting in different aspects, it adds a huge burden o n cost, labor , and time to screen them individually. Hence there is a ne ed to increase the throughput of the screening process. 166 To this end, one could use the output from M -CREATE selection and feed the selected library of variants into one of a fast -screen technique such as the single -cell RNA sequencing250 or by RNA probe based hybridization methods260, either of which may have the power to rank variants based on their tropism, transduction efficiency and specificity in vivo . The high -confidence outcome from M -CREATE can also serve as a good learning dataset for machine learning or in silico pipelines that can capture information that were not previously ident ified in our data analysis . There are different algorithms that have been used to perform in silico evolution or protein structure predictions which could potentially be useful to apply to our datasets69,273 -275. Such approaches can improve our understanding on the design of our selections or the hidden outcomes and alleviate some of the labor intensive bench -work involved in the traditional large scale selection studies. 4.4 POTENTIAL APPLICATION S OF AAV VECTOR TOOLKIT The AAV -PHP vectors identified by M -CREATE coul d have broad application s in neuroscience , and can be put to immediate use in studies involving rodents . For instance, previously , AAV -PHP.B vectors were used in basic neuroscience studies in mice163,189,191, in neurological disease models158, and in preclinical gene the rapy applications161,276,277. And one can hope to see similar applications from vectors like AAV -PHP.N or AAV -PHP.Cs . The AAV -PHP.V variants will open up new application in the field that studies BBB malformations, that are widely associated with various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's247,249, or aging studies278, or other neuropathologies215,279,280. For applications beyond rodents, further investigations ar e required for AAV -PHP.Cs across species to determine their use as gene delivery vector. 167 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
