There is no single treat - ment protocol for atopic dermatitis. Local and systemic pharmaceuticals, as well as non- drug substances, have traditionally been used to treat the condition. Treatment with topical corticosteroids, antibacterial agents, topical calcineurin treatment with mono - clonal antibodies have all exhibited varying degrees of success in eliminating symptoms of atopic dermati-tis [3, 4]. But it is also true that these same treatment modalities have sometimes been ineffective, or have caused side effects. Uncontrolled symptoms, reoccur - ring flare-ups, and side effects of pharmaceuticals have incentivized patients to seek alternative treatment mo-dalities. The number of patients with atopic dermati-tis that use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has increased [5]. According to statistics, 6% of patients with dermatological conditions in the United States use some form of CAM [6]. Acupuncture is be-coming increasingly popular among atopic dermatitis patients [7, 8]. Acupuncture has been in use for the past 3,000 to 5,000 years [9]. It is one of the most universally recog - nized components of Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM. TCM also incorporates dietary therapies, herbal medicine, body work, and exercise. All components of TCM use basic principles such as Yin/Yang, Five Ele-ments, Jing/Luo, and Zang/Fu organ theories as a foun - dation in the assessment of health for the purposes of Abstract Atopic dermatitis, or allergic eczema, is a chronic inflam-matory skin condition which is noncontagious and leads to itchy, dry skin lesions that can damage the intact skin barri-er. Although the etiology is not known, it is widely believed that family history and allergies play a role. The incidence of atopic dermatitis is usually higher in early childhood, while other allergic conditions can develop later in life, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Atopic dermatitis is typically treated through topical ointments and the systematic use of pharmaceuticals to control symptoms. Long term or improp - er use of medications can lead to other complications. When symptoms of the condition are chronic or recurring, they can seriously impact one's quality of life, resulting in many pa-tients seeking alternative care. However, the efficacy and safety of alternate modalities remain a major concern in the health care field. Acupuncture is one such modality used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Although multiple stud-ies have established the safety of acupuncture, its efficacy with atopic dermatitis and similar conditions is still being explored. This review will discuss the use of various forms of acupuncture and their mechanisms in addressing atopic dermatitis. Keywords Atopic dermatitis, Treatment, AcupunctureLiteRAtuRe Review Check for updates Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition character - ized by pruritus, dry skin, and eczema [1]. It is known for its propensity to relapse under certain conditions. Although the etiology is unknown, it is believed that genetic factors, together with family history of atopic disease, stress, allergies and inflammatory conditions play a role in the appearance of the condition. Immu- nological variations such as overproduction of the IgE, antigen, specific IgE antibodies, epidermal barrier dys-function, and environmental triggers are identified in ISSN: 2572-3308DOI: 10.23937/2572-3308.1510030 Akpinar and Karatay. Int J Aller Medications 2018, 4:030 Page 2 of 5 determining the best form of treatment [10]. The ap- proach to treatment in this context is more patient-cen-tered, where signs and symptoms are evaluated, and a pathological syndrome analysis is conducted with in - formation gathered according to TCM principles. Treat - ment is geared toward the causative factor(s) of the un - derlying issue, not just symptom control. One of the most debilitating symptoms of atopic der- matitis is severe pruritus [11]. Scratching of lesions due to pruritus can result in destruction of the natural skin barrier, leading to complications such as bleeding and in-fection. Therefore, most of the studies investigating the efficacy of acupuncture in atopic dermatitis have focused on pruritus. At first, antipruritic effects of acupuncture have been demonstrated with artificially-induced pruri-tus in healthy patients in placebo-controlled studies [12]. In addition, a number of reports supports the antiprurit- ic effects of acupuncture in diseases that cause pruritus [13-15]. In comparative studies, acupuncture has been shown to provide better results than antihistamines and preventive antipruritic systemic drugs [12, 16]. Although studies demonstrate positive outcomes, the mechanism of action with the antipruritic effects of acupuncture is still unknown. It is believed that, as with other effects of acupuncture, antipruritic effects are due to peripheral and central mechanisms. Anti-allergic and anti-inflam-matory effects might be the reasons behind peripheral antipruritic actions. It is known that IgE expression plays an important role in acute and chronic skin inflamma- tion [14]. IgE is carried on basophils cells' surfaces, which is important in IgE-mediated allergies. A pilot study showed that acupuncture caused a reduction in activa-tion of basophils in patients with atopic dermatitis [15]. In an animal study, acupuncture reduced serum IgE lev-els, as well as mRNA expressions of IL-4, IL-8, and TNF- pro-inflammatory cytokines [14]. In addition, decreasing in mast cell count and histamine release could also play a role in alleviation of the lesions and antipruritic effects of acupuncture in atopic dermatitis patients [17]. Mod-ulatory effects of acupuncture hormones, growth factors, and oxidative fac- tors have been known for a long time [8 ]. Acupuncture is used in inflammatory diseases due to its effect in re - ducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2, and nitric oxide synthesis [18, 19]. The anti-inflammatory effects of acupuncture could also contribute to the treat-ment of atopic dermatitis. Increase in blood flow to local needle insertion sites, as well as the structures that are related to the area, have been demonstrated in previ-ous studies [8 ,20]. These factors could be responsible for healing lesions, as well as normalizing of the thickening of the skin. Other than the peripheral effects of acupuncture on atopic dermatitis, there could be central mechanisms as well. The mechanism of the antipruritic effects of acu- puncture in the brain has been studied with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Napadow, et al. have observed brain activities in the validated tem - perature-modulation itch model with fMRI on patients with atopic dermatitis [12]. In this study, patients were placed into four separate groups while their brain activ- ities were recorded through fMRI. The four groups con - sisted of verum (real) acupuncture, placebo acupunc - ture, verum antihistamine solution, and placebo solu - tion. Researchers reported a decline in the itch-evoked activation in insula, putamen, the premotor cortex, and the prefrontal cortex of the brain, as well as a decrease in itch sensation in acupuncture group patients with atopic dermatitis. These were not observed in antihis - taminic and placebo groups. Itch reduction was also correlated with the level of reduction in response in putamen. Due to these results, researchers concluded that putamen might be responsible for the itch sensa- tion in atopic dermatitis patients. Previous research has already established the role of central sensitization of itch in diseases that caused chronic itch, such as atopic dermatitis [21]. Acupuncture treatment can be effective in modulation of central sensitization. In addition to addressing central and peripheral an- ti-itch effect as discussed above, acupuncture can also affect stress factors which are important in etiopatho - genesis of atopic dermatitis. Acupuncture is an effective modality for treating emotional disturbances and for re - ducing stress responses. Therefore, it has been used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders [22]. Research has shown that acupuncture can induce ben-eficial changes in the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, substance-P, endorphins, and enkephalins in patients with pain and emotional disturbances [23]. Acupuncture has been found to affect the limbic sys-tem, which is responsible for stress-related symptoms [24]. The role of stress is important in the etiology of allergy-related skin disorders and their propensity for reoccurrence. Therefore, acupuncture is also valuable in the treatment of atopic dermatitis by virtue of the fact that it can reduce a patient's level of stress. Various systemic reviews and a meta-analysis have assessed studies about the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [7, 25,26]. The vari- ous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria demonstrated a reduction in itching, lesion size, and recurrence in an acupuncture group compared to a control group. While there were no sta-tistical differences between control and acupuncture groups in some of the studies, there were others that did not use control groups. All systemic reviews and the meta-analysis concluded that there is a need for high quality, standardized, and controlled RCTs. TCM treat - ment philosophy might be the reason behind the vari-ances in the study results. According to TCM, the dis - ease process in general is the result of an imbalance in one of the five vital substances, or energy flow in the channel system. In terms of a five-element theory, this is also seen as an imbalance between the five elements. ISSN: 2572-3308DOI: 10.23937/2572-3308.1510030 Akpinar and Karatay.

In both cases, patients only received auricular therapy. There are multiple case studies which incorporated different styles of acupuncture with successful results. One of them is Sa-Am acupuncture, which is a Korean style. A case study presented by Jeon, et al. used Kore - an Sa-Am acupuncture to treat a 22-year-old female tient with an eight-year history of atopic dermatitis [32]. Her first visit to the office was during an acute flare-up, which was accompanied by erythematous skin rash. Syndrome analysis revealed that the patient was not in balance between the Arm Tai Yin channel and Foot Tai Yang channel. Three points SP 3, LU 9, and BL 67, were manipulated to balance these channels. Pictorial progression of the treatment revealed disappearance of the lesion. In another case study from Korea, Lee, et al. treated a 25-year-old male patient with a history of atopic dermatitis, who was hospitalized due to Kaposi's Varicella eruption [33]. Eruptions were cleared within ten days, with systemic and local application of herbal formulas and the use of Master Tung's points. Female patients with atopic dermatitis can expe- rience flare-ups during pregnancy. Because the use of certain pharmaceutical drugs during pregnancy is not recommended [34], acupuncture can offer a safe and reliable treatment method for pregnant women suffer-ing from atopic dermatitis. However, practitioners must keep in mind that there are specific points which should not be used on pregnant patients. Another case report presented successful results in treatment of atopic der-matitis with Korean acupuncture in pregnant women [35]. Three pregnant women who could not use con - ventional medicine were treated with acupuncture, Ko- rean herbal medicine, and herbal wet wraps. In these instances, local points near the lesions were needled as well as standard acupuncture treatments. Severity Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index showed im-provement in the severity of atopic dermatitis and relief of its symptoms. There were no undesirable side effects on the pregnancy, including fetal or neonatal develop- ment. This was confirmed by laboratory tests and ob - servational monitoring. Other than safe use of acupuncture in pregnant women, case reports demonstrate that acupuncture is used with pediatric atopic dermatitis patients. Yu and Kizhakke Veettil worked on two pediatric patients, ages 8 and 11, who were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis at infancy [1]. Patients were treated with TCM style acupuncture. Syndrome analysis for both conditions re - vealed a deficiency state which was rectified by using strengthening points. Points included in the study were CV 12, ST 36, SJ 5, LI 11, LU7, ST 40, SP 9 and KI 3. After a full course of 12 treatment sessions, lesions and pruri - tus completely disappeared. In this case study, patients were checked at regular intervals and no reoccurrence Causative factors in imbalances can vary from patient to patient. Therefore, different patients who are expe-riencing the same disease process might exhibit differ - ent underlying causative factors. In these cases, when a study uses standardized point protocols, the efficacy of acupuncture can vary, which challenges RCT results as well as diminishing the effectiveness of acupuncture. To overcome this issue, some RCTs used acupoints that addressed the individualized needs of patients in addi - tion to standardized protocols that have been shown to be effective [15]. There are considerable published case studies that show successful results using syndrome analysis and individualized acupuncture treatments. Large numbers of studies conducted on patients with pruritus and dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis used LI 11 (Quchi) as a standard antipruritic point. There are multiple studies showing reduction in itch sensation through the stimulation of this point with needling, pressure, moxa, or cold applications [14,27]. LI 11 is an important point on the Large Intestine chan - nel, this point is used to clear heat, which is considered a yang pathogen, from the skin (which happens to be the Yang part of the body). Because LI 11 is on a Yang Ming channel, it is more effective in clearing heat, which is why it used in cases of itchy, dry, and scaly inflamed skin conditions. Quchi is located at the lateral end of the transverse cubital crease when the arm is flexed ninety degrees [ 28]. In other studies, local points were used instead of these standard points. Park, et al. have investigated dif - ferences in responses between manipulation of LI 11 and local points [14]. According to this study, both local points and LI 11 reduced cutaneous hyperplasia and se-rum IgE levels, but only LI 11 was able to reduce mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteins. Other than TCM acupuncture, there are many other styles of acupuncture that address dermatological dis - eases. Auricular acupuncture, which is a component of microsystem has been used in treatment of dermato- logical conditions. Microsystems are parts of the body that represent the whole body. Utilizing principles sim-ilar to those in reflexology, scalp, ears, eyes, tongue, and other locations in body are used for diagnostic and treatment purposes [29]. Allergy points exist in many different styles of ear acupuncture. A study conducted by Soliman compared Dr. Poul Nogier's auricular proto - col for with Allergy Treat - ment (SAAT) [30]. Dr. Nogier, who developed auricular microsystems in the 1960s, used an antihistaminic point to treat allergies. Dr. Nogier's antihistaminic point is located in the apex of the ear, where the external and internal surfaces meet [31]. SAAT is an expansion of this system, which locates active points in the ear during an allergic attack. Point stimulation is performed using in - tradermal needles, which stay in the dermal layer with - out harming cartilage tissue.

There is no universally recognized \"gold standard\" treatment protocol for atopic dermatitis. This is largely due to the myriad of factors that play a role in its etiolo - gy. Varying degrees of success have been reported with pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment methods. The availability of clinical evidence behind many of these treatments is very low due to the insuf - ficient number of controlled RCTs [4]. Side effects that develop due to the use of conventional management and unresponsiveness to medication are limiting factors behind the use of treatments for prolonged periods of time. Taking these issues into consideration, acupunc - ture which improves symptoms of atopic dermatitis and prolongs the duration between flare-ups without seri-ous side effects could be promising for the patient pop - ulation at large.
