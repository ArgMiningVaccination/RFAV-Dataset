Following extensive consultation with members and staff of state medical boards, and a review of emerging best practices, the FSMB first issued A Guide to the Essentials of a Modern Medical Practice Act in 1956. The stated purposes of this guidance documen t were: 1. To serve as a guide to those states that may adopt new medical practice acts or may amend existing laws; and 2. To encourage the development and use of consistent standards, language, definitions, and tools by boards responsible for physician and phys ician assistant regulation. Over the years, dynamic changes in medical education, in the practice of medicine, and in the diverse responsibilities that face medical boards have necessitated frequent revision of a state or territory's medical practice act. The Essentials underwent numerous revisions to respond to these changes and assist member boards to be consistent with best practices in the interests of public protection and patient safety. The guidance document adopted in 2018 , Guidelines for the Struct ure and Function of a State Medical and Osteopathic Board (\"Structure and Function\"), incorporate d the contents of prior Elements and Essentials documents, containing the principles of state medical board responsibility, duty, empowerment, and accountabili ty that the initial documents outlined, as well as detailing the essential components for the structure and function of a state medical board. The Structure and Function was reviewed and updated in 2021 to reflect not only relevant characteristics of effec tive medical boards, but also a number of innovative concepts not yet widely implemented. This guidance document is worthy of consideration for adaptation to the requirements of any state or territorial jurisdiction. Although it could hardly be expected th at any one jurisdiction would accept every component of this model, it should lead every jurisdiction to assess its present board structure and function. Does the status quo provide 2 maximum potential for protection of the public interest? Though presented for consideration as an integrated whole, the guidelines offer approaches to a variety of issues that concern many boards, including: funding and budgeting, confidentiality, board authority, personnel and staffing, administration, emergency powers, trainin g of board members, immunity and indemnity, standards of evidence, and the transparency . Recognizing the differences among jurisdictions, this document is designed with the flexibility to accommodate as many of those differences as possible, while maintain ing the integrity of the overall concept. Some sections empower boards to adopt alternatives of their choice, provided they are in accord with other state statutes, while other sections are phrased loosely to allow boards necessary discretionary authority. These guidelines may thus be seen not as one proposal but as various proposals. Each is applicable in one form or another to a diversity of settings, and all are aimed at increasing or refining the ability of state medical boards to better protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. The Federation urges member boards to consider including any recommendations contained herein in their respective medical practice acts, rules, or their own guidance documents. The following guidelines apply equally t o boards that govern physicians who have acquired the M.D. or D.O. degree, and the terms used herein should be interpreted throughout with this understanding. 3 Table of Contents Section I.

Definitions The following terms have the following meanings: \"Assessment Program\" means a formal system to examine or evaluate a physician's competence within the scope of the physician's practice. \"Competence\" means possessing the requisite abilities and qualities (cognitive, non -cognitive, and communicative) to perform effectively within the scope of the physician's practice while adhering to professional ethical standards. \"Dyscompetence\" means failing to maintain acceptable standards in one or more areas of professional physician practice. (HOD 1999) \"Impairment\" means a physician's inability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and saf ety due to untreated : 1. Mental, psychological, or psychiatric illness, disease, or deficit; 2. Physical illness or condition, including, but not limited to, those illnesses or conditions that would adversely affect cognitive, motor, or perceptive skills; or 3. Habitual, excessive, or illegal use or abuse of drugs defined by law as controlled substances, illegal drugs, alcohol, or of other impairing substances. \"Incompetence\" means lacking the requisite abilities and qualities (cognitive, non -cognitive, and commu nicative) to perform effectively in the scope of the physician's practice. \"License\" means any license, certificate, or other practice authorization granted by the Board pursuant to the medical practice act, or any other applicable statute. \"Licensee\" mean s the holder of any license, certificate, or other practice authorization granted by the Board. \"Licensed physician\" means a physician licensed to practice medicine in the jurisdiction. \"Medical Practice Act\" means the statute that determines the structure and function of a state medical or osteopathic board. Section II below addresses categories to which the medical practice act does not typically apply. \"Physician assistant\" means a ski lled person who by training, scholarly achievements, submission of acceptable letters of recommendation, and satisfaction of other requirements of the Board has been licensed for the provision of patient services with a practice agreement in place. \"Practice of medicine\" is consistent with the following: 1. Advertising, holding out to the public, or representing in any manner that one is authorized to practice medicine in the jurisdiction; 2. Offering or undertaking to prescribe, order, give, or administer any drug or medicine for 7 use by any other person; 3. Offering or undertaking to prevent or to diagnose, correct, and/or treat in any manner or by any means, methods, or devices any disease, illness, pain, wound, fracture, infirmity, defect, or abnormal physical or mental condition of any person, including the management of pregnancy and parturition; 4. Offering or undertaking to perform any surgical operation upon any person; 5. Rendering a written or otherwise documented medical opinion c oncerning the diagnosis or treatment of a patient or the actual rendering of treatment to a patient within a state by a physician located outside the state as a result of transmission of individual patient data by electronic or other means from within a st ate to such physician or the physician's agent; 6. Rendering a determination of medical necessity or a decision affecting the diagnosis and/or treatment of a patient; and 7. Using the designation Doctor, Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine/Doctor of Osteopathy, Physician, Surgeon, Physician and Surgeon, Dr., M.D., D.O., or any combination thereof in the conduct of any occupation or profession pertaining to the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of human disease or condition unless such a designation additionally contains the description of another branch of the healing arts for which one holds a valid license in the jurisdiction where the patient is located. The definition of the practice of medicine may also include several excepti ons, which exempt certain activities from the categorization of the practice of medicine. The practice of medicine is determined to occur where the patient is located in order that the full resources of the state are available for the protection of that pa tient. \"Remediation\" means the process whereby deficiencies in physician performance identified through an examination or assessment program are corrected, resulting in an acceptable state of physician competence. \"Supervising physician\" means a licensed p hysician in good standing in the same jurisdiction as the physician assistant who supervise s the services of a physician assistant, and who has in writing formally accepted the responsibility for such supervision. \"Telemedicine\" means the practice of medic ine using electronic communications, information technology, or other means between a licensee in one location, and a patient in another location, with or without an intervening healthcare provider. Generally, telemedicine is not an audio -only, telephone c onversation, e -mail/instant messaging conversation, or fax. It typically involves the application of secure videoconferencing or store and forward technology to provide or support healthcare delivery by replicating the interaction of a traditional, encounter in person between a provider and a patient. (HOD 2014) 8 Section II. The Medical Practice Act The structure and function of each of the 71 medical regulatory boards (allopathic, osteopathic and composite) within the United States and its territories are determined by a unique state statute (or group of statutes), usually referred to as a medical practice act. The differences among these statutes are related to the general administrative structure of each jurisdiction and to the needs of the public as they are perceived by each responsible legislative body. The medical practice act should provide for a separate state medical board, acting as a governmental agency to regulate the practice of medicine, in order to protec t the public from unlawful, incompetent, unqualified, impaired, or unprofessional practitioners of medicine, through licensure, regulation, and rehabilitation of the medical profession in the state. Generally, the medical practice act should authorize Boar ds to promulgate rules and regulations to facilitate the enforcement of the act. Boards should be authorized to adopt and enforce rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the medical practice act and to fulfill their duties under the act. Board s should adopt rules and regulations in accord with administrative procedures established in the respective jurisdiction. Statement of purpose The medical practice act should be introduced by a statement specifying the purpose of the act. This statement sh ould include language expressing the following concepts: The practice of medicine is a privilege granted by the people acting through their elected representatives. In the interests of public health, safety, and welfare, and to protect the public from any unprofessional, improper, incompetent, unlawful, fraudulent, and/or deceptive practice of medicine, it is necessary for the government to provide laws and regulations to govern the granting and subsequent use of the privilege to practice medicine. The primary responsibility and obligation of the state medical board is to act in the sovereign interests of the government by protecting the public through licensing, regulation and education as directed by the state government. Sample Statement of Purpose: As a matter of public policy, the practice of medicine is a privilege granted by the people of the State acting through their elected representatives by their adoption of the Medical Practice Act. Therefore, in the interests of public health, safety and we lfare, and to protect the public from any unprofessional, improper, incompetent, unlawful, fraudulent, and/or deceptive practice of medicine, it is necessary to provide laws and regulations to govern the granting and subsequent use of the privilege to prac tice medicine and to ensure, as much as possible, that only qualified 9 and fit persons hold that privilege. The Board's primary responsibility and obligation is to protect the public, and any license, certificate or other practice authorization issued pursu ant to this statute shall be a revocable privilege and no holder of such a privilege shall acquire thereby any irrevocable right. Exemptions The medical practice act should not apply to: 1. Students while engaged in training in a medical school approved or recognized by the state medical board, unless the board licenses or registers the student; 2. Those providing service in cases of emergency where no fee or other consideration is contemplated, charged or received by the physician or anyone on behalf of the physician; 3. Commissioned medical officers of the armed forces of the United States and medical officers of the United States Public Health Service or the Veterans Administration of the United States in the discharge of their official duties and/or within fede rally controlled facilities, provided that such persons who hold medical licenses in the jurisdiction should be subject to the provisions of the act and provided that all such persons should be fully licensed to practice medicine in one or more jurisdictio ns of the United States. Further, the military physician should be subject to the Military Health System Clinical Quality Assurance (CQA) Program 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1094; Regulation DOD 6025.13 -R; 4. Those practicing dentistry, nursing, optometry, psychology, or a ny other of the healing arts in accord with and as provided by the laws of the jurisdiction; 5. Those practicing the tenets of a religion or ministering religious based medical procedures or ministering to the sick or suffering by mental or spiritual means in accord with such tenets; 6. Those administering a lawful domestic or family remedy to a member of one's own family; 7. Those fully licensed to practice medicine in another jurisdiction of the United States who temporarily render emergency medical treatment or briefly provide critical medical service at the specific lawful direction of a medical institution or federal agency that assumes full responsibility for that treatment or service and is approved by the state medical board; a nd 8. Those fully licensed to practice medicine in another jurisdiction of the United States who is employed or formally designated as the team physician by an athletic team visiting the jurisdiction for a specific sporting event, and the physician limits the practice of medicine in the jurisdiction to medical treatment of the members, coaches, and staff of the sports entity that employs (or has designated) the physician. Unlawful Practice of Medicine The medical practice act should provide a definition of the unlawful practice of medicine and penalties for such unlawful practice. These provisions of the act should implement or be consistent with the following: 10 1. It should be unlawful to perform any act constituting the practice of medicine as defined in the medi cal practice act without first obtaining authorization in accord ance with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations of the Board. Other licensed health care professionals may provide medical services within the scope of the laws governing t hat profession . 2. The Board should be authorized to seek civil remedies pursuant to state law to address the unlawful practice of medicine. 3. It should be a felony for any person, corporation, or association that performs any act constituting the practice of m edicine as defined in the medical practice act, or causing or aiding and abetting such actions. 4. Unless rules governing the practice of medicine are suspended or temporar ily modified by an executive order or action of the Board, a physician located in anoth er state practicing within the state by electronic or other means without a license (full, special purpose or authorization ) issued by the Board should be deemed guilty of a felonious offense. Section III. State Medical Board Duty, Responsibility, and Powe r In some states, responsibility for licensing and disciplinary functions is divided between two separate Boards. In others, Boards are subject to supervision or, in some cases, complete control by larger administrative or umbrella agencies. In a few states, the Board is simply an advisory body. In most states, the Board regulates both allopathic and osteopathic physicians; in others, separate boards exist. And in some states, narrow constitutional restrictions inhibit effective Board funding. Clearly, the following section proposes a true working board with real and effective power and support, a proposal some states are much better prepared to implement than others. The section also reflect s those principles the authors consider to be basic to the ope ration of any accountable medical board, regardless of the administrative structure of the state, the size or distribution of the physician population being regulated, the form of legislation required for funding, or the title of the body to which responsi bility and power for regulation have been entrusted. It may be drawn upon by both allopathic and osteopathic boards, making appropriate adaptations in the area of Board membership. Larger administrative agencies can use it to better assess their own struct ures and functions and to explore the broader roles their medical boards might play in meeting public expectations. It is necessary that Boards have the responsibilities and powers necessary to fulfill the duties conferred on the Board by the medical pract ice act. These duties, responsibilities, and powers are to be liberally construed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the Board's State. It is the duty of Boards to determine a physician's initial and continuing qualification and fitness for the practice of medicine. Boards should be empowered to initiate proceedings against the unprofessional, improper, incompetent, unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, or unlicensed practice of medicine, and enforce the medical practice act and related rules. Boards should discharge these duties and responsibilities in accord with the medical practice act and other governing laws. 11 In addition to any other duty, responsibility, and power provided to the Board in the medical practice act, the Board, acting in accord with its medical practice act and the requirements of due process, should: 1. Enforce the provisions of the medical practice act; 2. Develop, adopt and enforce rules and regulations to affect the provisions of the medical practice act and to fulfill t he Board 's duties thereunder; 3. Select and/or administer licensing examination(s); 4. Employ or contract with one or more organizations or agencies known to provide acceptable examinations for the preparation, administration, and scoring of required examination s; 5.

Impose conditions, sanctions, deny licensure, levy fines, seek appropriate civil and/or criminal penalties, or any combination of these, against those who violate or attempt to violate examination security, those who obtain or attempt to obtain licensure by fraud or deception, and those who knowingly assist in such activities; 7. Acquire information about and evaluate medical education and training of applicants; 8.

State Medical Board Membership State medical board s bear primary responsibility for licensing and regulating the medical profession for the protection of the public. Every board should include physician and public members. All board m embers should act to further the public interest, not their personal or professional interests. Composition and Size The board should consist of enough members to appropriately discharge its duties, and at least 25% should be public members. The board shou ld consider several factors when determining the appropriate size and composition, including the size of a state's physician population, the 15 composition and functions of board committees, adequate separation of prosecutorial and judicial powers, and the ot her work of the board described throughout this document. The board should be of sufficient size to allow for recusals due to conflicts of interest and occasional member absences to avoid concentrating final decisions in the hands of too few members or los s of a quorum. Qualifications Board membership should be drawn from different regions of the state and diverse specialties, and should reflect the demographics of the state. Sex, race, national or ethnic origin, creed, religion, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, or age above majority sh ould not preclude an individual from serving on the board. All physician board members should reside in the stat e and be in active practice1 at least 20 hours per week , hold a full and unrestricted medical licenses in the jurisdiction, be persons of recognized professional ability and integrity, and resided or practiced in the jurisdiction long enough to be famili ar with the laws, policies, and practice in the jurisdiction (e.g., five years). In addition, physician members should not have had any public disciplinary action by any licensing board during the past ten years before applying for appointment, no history of felony convictions of any kind, and no misdemeanor convictions related to the practice of medicine. Public members should reside in the state and be persons of recognized ability and integrity; not be licensed physicians, providers of health care, or r etired physicians or health care providers; have no past or current substantial personal or financial interests in the practice of medicine or with any organization regulated by the board (except as a patient or caregiver of a patient); and have no immedia te familial relationships with any licensees or any organization regulated by the Board, unless otherwise required by law. Public members should represent a wide range of careers . Board m embers should not be registered as a lobbyist representing any healt h care interest or association nor be an officer, board member, or employee of a state or national organization established for advocating the interests of individuals involved in the practice of medicine or any organization regulated by the board. Terms Appointed b oard m embers should serve staggered terms to ensure continuity. Term length s should be set to permit development of effective skill s and experience by members (e.g., three or four years). However, a limit should be set on consecutive terms of service (e.g., two or three consecutive terms). A board member may be reappointed two years after completion of such service. A person who serve s more than half of an un -expired term should be considered to have served a full term. 1 FSMB Report of the Special Committee on Reentry to Practice (HOD 2012) defines the clinically active physician as one who, at the time of license renewal, is engaged in direct, consultative, or supervisory patient care, or as further defined by the st ates. 16 Requirements Before assuming the duties of office, the following should be required of each board member: 1. Take a constitutional oath or affirmation of office; 2. Swear or affirm that the member is qualified to serve under all applicable statutes; 3. Sign a statement agreeing to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may arise for that member in the conduct of board business; 4. Sign a confidentiality and ethics stateme nt agreeing to maintain the confidentiality of confidential board business and patient identification and uphold high ethical standards in discharging board duties. The Board should also conduct, and new members should attend, an annual training program designed to familiarize new members with their duties and the ethics of public service. Appointment Board members should be appointed by the Governor or Legislature , and the appointment should be made at least 30 calendar days prior to the beginning of the board term. The appointing authority should fill an unexpired term within 30 calendar days of the vacancy's occurrence. The incumbent should serve until the appointing authority names a replacement. A ny individual, organization or group should be permitted to recommend potential board appointees. Removal The appointing authority should remove b oard member s from the board if they: 1. Cease to be qualified; 2. Submit a written resignation to the appointing au thority ; 3. Are absent from the state for a period of more than six months; 4. Are found guilty of a felony or an unlawful act involving moral turpitude by a court of competent jurisdiction; 5. Are found guilty of malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in relatio n to the ir Board duties by a court of competent jurisdiction; 6. Are found to be mentally incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction; 7. Fail to attend three successive board meetings without just cause as determined by the board, or if a new member fail s to attend the new members' training program without just cause as determined by the board; 8. Are found to be in violation of the medical practice act; or 9. Are found to be in violation of the conflict of interest/ethics law. Com pensation/Reimbursement Board m embers should receive appropriate compensation for services and reimbursement for expenses. Compensation: Service on the Board should not present an undue economic hardship. 17 Board members should therefore receive compensation in an amount sufficient to allow full participation and not preclude qualified individuals from serving. Expenses: Each board member's reasonable travel expenses necessarily and properly incurred for active board service should be reimbursed . Education/Training: Travel expenses, and daily compensation should also be paid for each board member's attendance, in or out of the board's jurisdiction, at education or training programs approved by the board and directly related to board duties. Section V. State Medical Board Structure Officers The board should elect annually from its members a president/chair, a vice president/vice -chair, a secretary -treasurer, and those other officers it determines are necessary to conduct its business. The off icers shall serve for a one -year term. President/Chair: The president/chair should approve board meeting agendas, preside at Board meetings, appoint board committees and their chairs, and perform those other duties assigned by the board and the medical pra ctice act . Vice President/Vice -Chair: The vice president/vice -chair should assist the president/chair in all duties as requested by the president/chair and should perform the duties of the president/chair in that officer's absence. Secretary/Treasurer: The secretary -treasurer should ensure the maintenance of the minutes of all meetings of the board and that the expenditure of funds complies with respective state law. Committees To effectively facilitate its work, fulfill its duties and exercise its powers, the board should establish standing committees . Examples include licensing, investigation, finance, administration, personnel, rules, legislative , communications, and public information committees. The chair should also be empowered to name ad hoc committees as required. Funding Board fees should be adequate to fund the board's ability to effectively regulate the practice of medicine under the act, and fees paid by licensees should be used only for purposes related to licensure, discipline, education and board administration. The board should deposit all revenues in an appropriate account, and the board should also receive all income earned on the deposit of such revenues. All fine s levied by the board may be deposited in the State General Fund or other fund as legally required . All administrative, investigative and adjudicatory costs recouped should be deposited in the board's account. 18 A designated officer of the board or employee , at the direction of the board, should oversee the collection and disbursement of funds . The State Auditor's Office (or the equivalent State office) should routinely audit the financial records of the board and report to the board and the Legislature. In the event the Legislature imposes additional responsibilities on the board beyond its statutory responsibilities for licensure and discipline, the Legislature should appropriate additional funds to the board sufficient to carry out such additional respons ibilities. Budget The board should develop and adopt its own budget reflecting revenues, including income earned thereon, and costs associated with each health care field regulated. Revenues , and in come earned thereon, from each health care field regulated , should fully support board regulation of that field. The budget should include allocations for establishment and maintenance of a reasonable reserve fund. Setting Fees and Charges All board fees and charges should be set by law or rule. The board should provide reasonable notice to the regulated healthcare professional and the public of all proposed increases or decreases in fees and charges. Fiscal Year The Board should operate on the same fiscal year as the State. Section VI.

Enforcement and Disciplinary Action Procedures The medical practice act should provide for procedures that will permit the Board to take appropriate enforcement and disciplinary action w hen and as required, while assuring fairness and due process to licensees. These provisions of the act should implement or be consistent with the following: Board Authority: The Board should be empowered to commence legal action to enforce the provisions o f the medical practice act and to exercise full discretion and authority with respect to disciplinary actions. In the course of an investigation, the Board's authority should include the ability to issue subpoenas to licensees, health care organizations, complainants, patients, and witnesses to produce documents or appear before the Board or staff to answer questions or be deposed. The Board should have the power to enforce its subpoenas, including disciplining a non-compliant licensee, and it is incumbent upon the subpoenaed party to seek a motion to quash the subpoena. Administrative Procedures: The existing administrative procedures act or similar statute, in whole or in part, should either be applicable to or serve as the basis of the pr ocedural provisions of the medical practice act. The procedural provisions should provide for Board investigation of complaints; notice of formal or informal charges or allegations to the licensee; a fair and impartial hearing for the licensee before the B oard, an examining committee or hearing officer; an opportunity for representation of the licensee by counsel; the presentation of testimony, evidence and arguments; subpoena power and attendance of witnesses; a record of the proceedings; and judicial revi ew by the courts in accordance with the standards established by the jurisdiction for such review. The Board should have subpoena authority to conduct comprehensive reviews of a licensee's patient and office records and administrative authority to access o therwise protected peer review records. The Board should not need the patients' consent to obtain copies of medical records, nor shall health care institutions' peer -review privilege bar the Board from obtaining copies of peer review information. Once in t he Board's possession, the 39 patient records and peer review records should have the same legal protection from disclosure as they have when in the possession of the licensee, the patient or the peer -review organization. Standard of Proof: The Board should b e authorized to use preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof in its role as trier of fact for all levels of discipline. Informal Conference: Should there be an open meeting law, an exemption to it should be authorized to permit the Board, at its discretion, to meet in informal conference with a licensee who seeks or agrees to such a conference. Disciplinary action taken against a licensee because of such an informal conference and agreed to in writing by the Board and the licensee should be binding and a matter of public record. However, license revocation and suspension should be held in open formal hearing, unless executive session is permitted by the State's open meetings law. The holding of an informal conference should not preclude an open formal hearing if the Board determines such is necessary. Summary Suspension: The Board should be authorized to summarily suspend or restrict a license prior to a formal hearing when it believes such action is required to protect the public from an immine nt threat to public health and safety. The Board should be permitted to summarily suspend or restrict a license by means of a vote conducted by telephone conference call or other electronic means if appropriate Board officials believe such prompt action is required. Proceedings for a formal hearing should be instituted simultaneously with the summary suspension. The hearing should be set within a reasonable time of the date of the summary suspension. No court should be empowered to lift or otherwise interfe re with such suspension while the Board proceeds in a timely fashion. Cease and Desist Orders/Injunctions: The Board should be authorized to issue a cease -and-desist order and/or obtain an injunction to restrain any person or any corporation or association and its officers and directors from violating any provision of the medical practice act. Violation of an injunction should be punishable as contempt of court. No proof of actual damage to any person should be required for issuance of a cease -and-desist or der and/or an injunction, nor should issuance of an injunction relieve those enjoined from criminal prosecution, civil action, or administrative process for violation of the medical practice act. Board Action Reports: All the Board's final disciplinary actions, non -administrative license withdrawals, and license denials, including related findings of fact and conclusions of law, should be matters of public record. The Board should report such actions and denials to the National Practitioner Data Bank and Board Action Data Bank of the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States within 30 days of the action being taken, to any other data repository required by law, and to the media. Voluntary surrender of and voluntary limitation(s) on the medical license of any person should also be matters of public record and should also be reported to the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States and to any other data repository by law. The Board should have the authority to keep co nfidential practice limitations and restrictions due to physical impairment when the licensee has not violated any provision in the medical practice act. 40 Tolling Periods of License Suspension or Restriction: The Board should provide, in cases of license su spension or restriction, that any time during which the disciplined licensee practices in another jurisdiction without comparable restriction shall not be credited as part of the period of suspension or restriction. Section XVI: Compulsory Reporting and I nvestigation The medical practice act should provide that certain persons and entities report to the Board any possible violation of the act or of the Board's rules and regulations by a licensee. These provisions of the act should implement or be consistent with the following: Any person should be permitted to report to the Board in a manner prescribed by the Board, any information he or she believes indicates a medical licensee is or may be dyscompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct, or mental ly or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of medicine. The following should be required to report to the Board promptly and in writing any information that indicates a licensee is or may be dyscompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct, or mentally or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of medicine; and any restriction, limitation, loss or denial of a licensee 's staff privileges or membership that involves patient care: 1. All licensees licensed under the act, 2. All licensed healt h care providers, 3. The state medical associations and its components, 4. All hospitals and other health care organizations in the state, to include hospitals, medical centers, long term care facilities, managed care organizations, ambulatory surgery centers, c linics, group practices, coroners, etc., 5. All chiefs of staff, medical directors, department administrators, service directors, attending physicians, residency directors, etc., 6. All liability insurance organizations, 7. All state agencies, 8. All law enforcement agencies in the state, 9. All courts in the state, 10. All federal agencies (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration, Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Veterans Health Administration, and Department of Defense), 11. All peer review bodies in the state, and 12. All resident training program directors. A licensee's voluntary resignation from the staff of a health care organization or voluntary limitation of a licensee's staff privileges at such an organization should be pro mptly reported to the Board by the organization if that action occurs while the licensee is under formal or informal investigation by the organization or a committee thereof for any reason related to possible medical incompetence, unprofessional conduct, o r mental, physical, alcohol or drug impairment. 41 Malpractice insurance carriers, the licensee's attorney, a hospital, a group practice, and the affected licensees should be required to file with the Board a report of each final judgment, settlement, arbitra tion award, or any form of payment by the licensee or on the licensee's behalf by any source upon any demand, claim, or case alleging medical malpractice, battery, dyscompetence, incompetence, or failure of informed consent. Licensees not covered by malpra ctice insurance carriers should be required to file the same information with the Board regarding themselves. All such reports should be made to the Board promptly (e.g., within 30 days). The Board should be permitted to investigate any evidence that appea rs to show a licensee is or may be medically incompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct, or mentally or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of medicine. Any person, institution, agency, or organization who reports in good faith and not ma de in bad faith, a licensee pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section should not be subject to civil damages or criminal prosecution for so reporting. A bad faith report is grounds for disciplinary action under the medical practice act. There should be no monetary liability on the part of, and no cause of action for damages should arise against, any person, institution, agency, or organization for reporting in good faith. To assure compliance with compulsory reporting requirements, specific civ il penalties should be established for demonstrated failure to report (e.g., up to $10,000 per instance). The Board should promptly acknowledge all reports received under this section. The Board should promptly notify persons or entities reporting under th is section of the Board's final disposition of the matters reported. Section XVII. Impaired Physicians The medical practice act should provide for the limitation, restriction, conditioning, suspension or revocation of the medical license of any licensee whose mental or physical ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety is impaired. The Board should also have the ability to create a safe harbor for applicants to gain a license if they are known to the confidential physician health progr am approved by the Board. The Board should have available to it a confidential impaired physician program approved by the Board and charged with the evaluation and treatment of licensees who are in need of rehabilitation. The Board may directly provide suc h programs or through a formalized contractual relationship with an independent entity whose program meets standards set by the Board. The Board shall have the ability to monitor or audit the program to ensure the program meets the requirements of the Boar d. The program approved by the Board shall by contract not have any financial relationship or incentive with those evaluation and treatment programs to which they refer practitioners. If available, the impaired physician program shall by contract be accred ited by the appropriate national or international accrediting body and maintain those 42 standards throughout the duration of the contract. Per the contract, participants in the program must sign irrevocable disclosure confidentiality waivers , to include federal protections, that allow the program to share information with the Board, evaluators, treatment programs , and other entities as necessary to the monitoring and rehabilitation process. The Board should be authorized, at its discretion, to req uire a licensee or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination, body fluid, nail, or hair follicle test, or a chemical addiction, abuse, or dependency evaluation conducted by an independent evaluator designated or approved in advance by the Boa rd. The results of the examination or evaluation should be admissible in any hearing before the Board or hearing officer, despite any claim of privilege under a contrary rule or statute. Every person who receives a license to practice medicine or who files an application for a license to practice medicine should be deemed to have given consent to submit to mental or physical examination or a chemical addition, abuse, or dependency evaluation, and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the res ults in any hearing before the Board. If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to an examination or evaluation when properly directed to do so by the Board, the Board should be permitted to enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of re fusal. If the Board finds, after an evaluation, examination or hearing, that a licensee is mentally, physically, or chemically impaired, it should be authorized to take one or more of the following actions: 1. Direct the licensee to submit to therapy, medical care, counseling, or treatment acceptable to the Board and comply with monitoring to ensure compliance; 2. Suspend, limit, restrict, or place conditions on the licensee's medical license for the duration of the impairment and monitoring or treatment; and/or 3. Revoke the licensee's medical license without further proof, need to establish a pattern, or a demonstration that the licensee is unable to be rehabilitated . Any licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing medicine under this provision should be afforded, at reasonable intervals, an opportunity to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that he or she can resume or begin the practice of medicine with reasonable skill and safety. While all impaired licensees should be reported to the Board in accord with the mandatory reporting requirements of the medical practice act, unidentified and unreported impaired licensees should be encouraged to seek treatment. To this end, the Board should be authorized, at its discretion, to establish rules and r egulations for the review and approval of a medically directed Physician Health Program (PHP). Those conducting a Board -approved PHP should be exempt from the mandatory reporting requirements relating to an impaired licensee who is participating satisfacto rily in the program, unless or until the impaired licensee ceases to participate satisfactorily in the program. The Board should require a PHP to report any impaired licensee whose participation is unsatisfactory to the Board as soon as that determination is made. Participation in an approved PHP should not protect an impaired licensee from Board action 43 resulting from a report of licensee impairment from another source or resulting from an investigation of other medical practice violations. The Board should be the final authority for approval of a PHP, should conduct a review of its approved program(s) on a regular basis and should be permitted to withdraw or deny its approval at its discretion. The PHP should be required to report to the Board information r egarding any violation of the medical practice act by a PHP participant, other than the impairment, even if the violation is unrelated to the licensee's impairment. Section XVIII: Dyscompetent and Incompetent Licensees The medical practice act should pro vide for the restriction, conditioning, suspension, revocation, or denial of the medical license of any licensee who the Board determines to be dyscompetent or incompetent. These provisions of the act should implement or be consistent with the following: The Board should be authorized to develop and implement methods to identify dyscompetent or incompetent licensees and licensees who fail to provide the appropriate quality of care. The Board should also be authorized to develop and implement methods to ass ess and improve licensee practices. The Board should have access to a Board -approved assessment program (s) charged with assessing licensees' clinical competency and fitness for duty . The Board should be authorized, at its discretion, to require a licensee or an applicant for licensure to undergo a physician competency evaluation conducted by a Board -designated independent evaluator at the licensee's own expense. The results of the assessment should be admissible in any hearing before the Board or hearing o fficer, despite any claim of privilege under a contrary rule or statute. Every person who receives a license to practice medicine or who files an application for a license to practice medicine should be deemed to have given consent to submit to a physician competency evaluation, and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the results in any hearing before the Board or hearing officer. If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to a competency assessment when properly directed to do so by the B oard, the Board should be permitted to enter a final order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of refusal to submit to such an evaluation. If the Board finds, after evaluation by the assessment program, that a licensee or applicant for licensure is unable to competently practice medicine, it should be authorized to take one or more of the following actions: 1. Suspend, revoke, or deny the licensee's medical license or application; 2. Restrict or limit the licensee's practice to those areas of demonstrated competence and comply with monitoring to ensure compliance; 3. Place conditions on the licensee's license; and/or 4. Direct the licensee to submit to a Board approved remediation program and comply with 44 monitoring to ensure compliance to resolve any identified deficits in medical knowledge or clinical skills acceptable to the Board. Any licensee or applicant for licensure who is prohibited from practicing medicine, or who has had restrictions or conditions placed upon their license, under the above s ection, should be afforded, at reasonable intervals, an opportunity to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that he/she can resume or begin the practice of medicine, or can practice without the restrictions or conditions, with reasonable skill and safety. The Board should be authorized to require the assessment program to provide to the Board a written report of the results of the assessment with recommendations for remediation of the identified deficiencies. The assessment program shall treat the Board order requiring the assessment of the applicant or licensee as undisputed fact. The assessment program shall notify the board if the applicant or licensee attempts to submit other materials or alternative narratives that counter the facts from the Bo ard. The Board should have access to Board approved remedial medical education programs for referral of licensees in need of remediation. Such programs shall incorporate and comply with standards set by the Board. During remediation, the program shall prov ide, at Board determined intervals, written reports to the Board on the licensee's progress. Upon completion of the remediation program, the program shall provide a written report to the Board addressing the remediation of the previously identified areas o f deficiency. The Board should be authorized to mandate that the licensee undergo post -remediation assessment to identify areas of continued deficit. The licensee shall be responsible for all expenses incurred as part of the assessment and the remediation. Section XIX: Physician Assistants The medical practice act should provide for the Board to license and regulate physician assistants. Administration Physician assistants should have full representation as full voting members on the board to include business, discipline, and hearing decisions on both physician and physician assistant matters . Licensing No person should perform or attempt to practice as a physician assistant without first obtaining a license from the Board and having a practice agreement in place . An applicant for licensure as a physician assistant should complete all Board application fo rms and pay a nonrefundable fee. The forms should request the applicant provide their name and address and such additional information as the Board deems necessary. The Board may issue a license to a physician assistant applicant who fulfills all board req uirements for licensure. Each licensed physician assistant should renew their license and file updated documentation 45 stating their name and current address and any additional information as required by the Board. A fee set by the Board should accompany eac h renewal and filing of updated documentation. The Board may require written notification if a practice agreement is changed or severed for a reason that would have an adverse effect for patient care. Persons not licensed by the Board who hold themselves o ut as physician assistants should be subject to penalties applicable to the unlicensed practice of medicine. Rules and Regulations The Board should be empowered to adopt and enforce rules and regulations for: 1. Setting qualifications of education, skill, and experience for the licensing of a person as a physician assistant and providing forms and procedures for licensure and for renewal; and 2. Evaluating applicants for licensure as physician assistants. Disciplinary Actions The Board should be empowe red to deny, revoke, or suspend any license, to limit or restrict the location of practice, to issue reprimands, to remove the authorization of a supervising physician, and to limit or restrict the practice of a physician assistant upon grounds and accordi ng to procedures similar to those for such disciplinary actions against licensed physicians. Such actions should be reported to the National Practitioner Databank and the Federation of State Medical Boards. Duties and Scope of Practice A physician assistan t should be permitted to provide those medical services that are within their training and experience and pursuant to a practice agreement . Supervision and Practice Arrangements The Board should be authorized to allow for individual, alternate, and/or grou p delegation/supervision models for physician assistants. Every physician supervising or employing a physician assistant should be legally responsible for the delegation of health care tasks to physician assistant and establishing a quality assurance mecha nism within the practice agreement to fulfil the responsibilities of supervision . Nothing in these provisions, however, should be construed to relieve the physician assistant of any legal liability or responsibility for any of their own acts and omissions. No physician should have under their supervision more staff, physician assistant, or otherwise than the physician can adequately supervise. In the event the supervising physician is absent or not in a group supervision setting , he or she must provide for appropriate support of the physician assistant by another licensed physician. Each and every relationship should adhere to all statutory requirements for licensure. Renewal The Board should be authorized, at its discretion, to require evidence of satisfactory completion of continuing medical education for license renewal.
