Homeopath means \"like cures like.\" Homeopaths are natural substances such as plants and minerals that are extremely diluted with either water or alcohol. They're made of substances, which if you took them in their whole form, can actually cause the symptoms you're experiencing. Developed in Germany in the late 1700s, homeopathy is a medical paradigm based on the notion that the body can cure itself. Homeopathy is considered to be safe for people of all ages, from children to the elderly. Triggering Your Body's Memory of How to Heal Consider a soap bubble. If you had a giant soap bubble and could see your reflection on it, there would be one image of you. If we pop the soap bubble and there were hundreds of thousands of little bubbles, we would see hundreds of thousands of a small but complete image of you. Each of those small images of you is as complete as the first one was, but now you have the potency of all of those broken up. A Natural and Gentle Approach With homeopathy, you are effectively jump-starting your body into fighting the problem itself by giving your immune system the necessary information to do so. This gentle approach has many clear advantages and is able to offer a response customized to your particular symptoms. Homeopathy helps the body to awaken its ability to heal. Remedies also prompt your body to make desired changes that are more lasting. They also help to wake up your body's ability to heal. Researchers believe homeopathy works on the unseen energy field that is the foundation of Eastern healing and others believe there's a detoxifying basis for the healing process that's invoked. All we know is that it works! If you've ever taken a large, hard-to-swallow pill and wonder how such a minute amount could make a difference in your body, consider the hormone created by your thyroid. The concentration in your blood is about one part per 10 billion. Yet that's enough to regulate the metabolism in your body to identify specific homeopathic remedies necessary to complement the stress reduction work we do with [NET](/neuro-emotional-technique/). To determine what homeopaths your body needs, we use muscle testing and a wellness check. You'll also complete a specific symptom survey form. We recommend the homeopathic remedies that were formulated by Dr. Scott Walker, who co-developed the neuro-emotional technique with his wife, Dr. Deborah Walker.
