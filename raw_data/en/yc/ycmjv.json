More and more credentialed health professionals are beginning to question that assumption, and what they're finding out about the lack of real science behind the assumed safety and efficacy of vaccines is actually quite shocking. Today, Dr Sherri Tenpenny speaks out in an interview with the Health Ranger, posted on NaturalNews.TV: [http://naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=4CD1FE39DDB898...](http://naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=4CD1FE39DDB89814031B07E7623CE8F7) In that interview, Dr Tenpenny says, \"It seems as though the pharmaceutical industry looks at children as nothing more than a repository of their products, whatever those products are... whether they are a vaccine, an artificial coloring from the food industry, something in a pill such as a medication, and we see these kids, they're not healthy, they're pale, they just don't look healthy. And then the pharmaceutical industry paints these happy pictures that we have to keep vaccinating these kids to keep them healthy. And the pediatricians say because these kids are sick, we need to vaccinate them more!\" Dr Tenpenny also calls out the huge conflicts of interest across the vaccine industry and pushers of vaccination policies, saying: \"The money isn't really to be made in the vaccine industry. The money is made by Big Pharma with all of the drugs that are given to treat and address all the illnesses that are subsequent to the side effects of the vaccines.\" \"If we could cut vaccination by 90 percent and get everybody's vitamin D levels up between 60 and 80 [ng / dl], we wouldn't have this health care problem that we have to tax everybody to death to try to take care of people. People would be healthy.\" About the underlying assumption that [vaccines](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccines.html) are a valid approach to health, Dr Tenpenny questions that, too, saying: \"True health cannot come from a needle. Injecting people with something to try to keep them well is a 200 year mistake.\" Speaking on the executives of the [vaccine](https://www.naturalnews.com/vaccine.html) companies who have knowingly released contaminated vaccines that harmed and killed innocent children, Dr Tenpenny says, \"Some of them will go to jail. Because I'm sure that some of them know absolutely what's going on.\" She goes on to compare the behavior of the vaccine companies to ENRON. Here's what else you'll hear about in this interview Why parents are waking up to the truth about vaccine dangers. Why vaccines are related to our epidemic of asthma and allergies. Why \"vaccines are the backbone of the entire pharmaceutical industry\" because they create lifelong disease requiring expensive medical treatments. How vaccines are made with 63 different chemicals that may pose a grave risk of harm to human [health](https://www.naturalnews.com/health.html) . Why there's no profit to be made in keeping people healthy, leading to the drug companies actually working to keep people stuck in a cycle of degenerative disease. Why infection and temporary illness is actually an important part of boosting long-term immunity and health. Why psychiatric drugs can cause young males to grow \"man boobs.\" Why there have never been any legitimate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on vaccines.
