What kind of training does Wyler Hecht have? Wyler Hecht received her training and completed both a doctorate degree in naturopathic medicine and a masters level degree in acupuncture at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM) in Tempe, AZ. SCNM is one of five accredited naturopathic medical schools in the US. For more information regarding these medical programs please go to [www.naturopathic.org](http://www.naturopathic.org). 2. What conditions can be treated with naturopathic medicine and / or acupuncture? Because naturopathic medicine and acupuncture are both systems of medicine based on a philosophy of restoring balance and removing the causes of disease, a vast array of conditions, both acute and chronic, can be treated effectively. Below is a list of conditions commonly treated or co-managed at Oconee Natural Healthcare.

Health insurance companies in GA rarely cover complimentary or alternative healthcare. Naturopathic medicine and naturopathic physicians are not recognized by the state of GA, and are not covered by GA health insurance policies. While acupuncture is a recognized and licensed profession in GA, acupuncture is excluded from coverage in most policies. There are some exceptions, so please check your policy if you are unsure. **On the other hand, flexible spending accounts and flex-plans typically do cover naturopathic visits and acupuncture. Many people use their \"flex\" (debit) cards at our clinic.** 5. How often will I have to see Wyler Hecht? This completely depends on the nature of the patient's health concerns and the level of intervention that he or she is seeking. One patient may want help deciphering a good supplement protocol while another may need ongoing care for a chronic condition. Visits could be anywhere from weekly (for a short period of time) to annually. 6. Is acupuncture painful? Acupuncture needles are extremely fine, and as many as 20 can fit inside the opening of a hypodermic needle. The skillful insertion of these fine needles rarely causes pain. Most patients describe the sensation as a mild, dull ache just below the needle or an \"electric sensation\" both of which dissipate after a minute or two. This sensation is known as Deqi (pronounced dah-chee) and is an important part of the healing process. Most patients feel completely relaxed during the treatment, and many patients fall asleep. "}
