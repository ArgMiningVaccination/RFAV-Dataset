Not all children have a forensic exam when removed by DCS. So you may be the only provider who can identify signs of abuse or neglect. Within 72 hours of placement the child should have An initial health assessment - to determine any urgent medical issues, provide scripts for any medications, arrange for any equipment or skilled nursing services needed and To evaluate for abuse and further work up. (some children may need to have this evaluation in the first 24 hours) The Rapid Response evaluation by the Behavioral Health System - which occurs in the first 72 hours to determine any acute behavioral Health issues - identify previous behavioral health services, to assist with the trauma of removal or any other traumas the child may have incurred and provide support to the family. Within 7 days of the Rapid response the child should have the first Behavioral health evaluation, and within the next 21 days have had the first Behavioral Health Service. Within the First 30 days after placement the child should have A comprehensive evaluation of their medical, dental, mental health developmental and educational status as part of the EPSDT The first visit with the Dentist. Follow up visits should include Re-evaluation every 60 -90 days to Assess for the continued effects of toxic stress on the child such as Altered immune function etc., as well as Altered cognitive functioning and development follow up on any adjustments the child is making to their new home follow up on any medical and behavioral health needs and ensure the child is receiving services coordinate the care and evaluation of behavioral health and educational issues continue to evaluate for abuse evaluate the caregiving aspects of the child - is the child getting the needed attention and caregiving, is the caregiver overwhelmed reports to DCS should occur if there are any concerns for abuse or neglect while in foster care Routine EPSDT visits Routine Dental visits 2 times a year The foster parent should be provided with a summary of the visit - which should include all the medication and any other diagnosis or medically related information pertinent to the child and the visit.

Provid- ers are required, under Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) \u00a736 -135, to report all immunizations given to children from birth to 18 years of age to the state's health department. By placing this data into the registry the provider meets this reporting requirement. The registry is a valuable tool for the reporting of immunization information to public health professionals, healthcare providers, parents, guardians and other child care personnel to manage the immunizations of children within the state. Under Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) \u00a736 -135 and Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) R9 -6-706 and 707 , children \"birth to 18\" years of age are re- quired to receive certain vaccines to enter childcare facilities and/or schools, and all healthcare professionals administering immunizations to children must report those immunization to the registry. Registry Goals To have recorded 100% of the vaccinations provided to children within the State. To provide all registered ASIIS providers with access to data stored in the registry, allowing them to check the registry for current and historical patient immunization records. To maintain the confidentiality of all patient information received in the registry. To ensure that healthcare professionals administering immunizations are reporting to the ASIIS registry in a regular and time ly manner. To provide a means for improved monitoring of immunization levels. http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/asiis/ Budesonide vs Pulmicort Providers - There is a very important change regarding these medications! Pulmicort inhalation solution IS covered by CMDP/AHCCCS AND requires a Prior Authorization. Budesonide inhalation solution (generic) is NOT covered by CMDP/AHCCCS. Historically, the generic would always be the preferred medication but in this instance, the brand is the covered medication. A Prior Authorization is required however. Please submit a Prior Authorization directly to MedImpact as you would any other medicatio ns that require authorization. You will find the MedImpact forms on the CMDP website at https://dcs.az.gov/cmdp or you can contact CMDP Medical Services Unit at (602) 351 -2245 for assistance. 3 FDA Alerts and Black Box Warnings The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Dexcom, Inc. has voluntarily recalled their continuous glucose monitoring system receivers because the audible alarm may not activate in the receiver piece when hypoglycemia or hyperglycem ia is detected. This system includes a sensor placed under the skin to measure blood glucose readings that are sent to a hand -held receiver. The systems are used in combination with standard home glucose monitoring devices in the management of diabetes. Relying on this product for notification of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia could result in serious adverse consequences, inclu ding death, because the auditory alarm may not alert the user of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Medimpact would notify CMDP if there were any members who received the specific lot number. No members have been identified. Additionally, MedImpact placed a POS message with hard stop on the affected NDCs stating, \"FDA product recall, do not dispense this product\". The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals refused to initiate a drug recall and refused to cease sterile drug production, as requested by the FDA. Therefore, at this time the FDA is alerting health care pr ofes- sionals to avoid use of any drug products that are intended to be sterile and that are produced and distributed nationwide by Phar- makon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Noblesville, Indiana. The FDA recently inspected the Pharmakon Pharmaceuticals facility (following a recent voluntary partial lot recall of morphin e sulfate 0.5mg/mL preservative free 1mL syringes for intravenous use, due to incorrect potency) and found unsanitary condition s, poor sterile production practices, environmental contamination for multiple sites within the clean rooms, and other deficienc ies. MedImpact has not approved claims for any of the active NDCs of Pharmakon products over the last 120 days. Additionally, MedImpact has placed a POS message with hard stop on the affected NDCs stating, \"FDA product warning due to lack of sterility assurance, do not dispense this product\". Healthcare professionals should immediately check their medical supplies and quarantine any drug products marketed as sterile from Pharmakon. These products should not be administered to patients; administration of non -sterile drug products that are in- tended to be sterile could result in serious and potentially life -threatening infections or death. Additional information is available at: http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts/ucm496448.htm Zika - Information for Providers Testing for Zika virus should be considered among patients who have signs and symptoms of disease and traveled to Zika -affected areas, or had sexual contact with someone suspected to have Zika virus infection. Testing for asymptomatic pregnant women can also be considered. Currently, commercial testing is not available; healthcare providers should contact the local health departmen t to report suspect cases and coordinate testing at a public health laboratory. More information about specimen collection, handling, and shipping for Zika virus is available here.

Children aged 36 to 72 months should be tested if they have not been previously tested. Children living in Arizona, but not in a targeted zip code, should receive an individual risk assessment questionnaire at age 12 and 24 months of age.

CDC Recommendations on Blood Lead Testing for Refugees Reporting Elevated Blood Lead Levels Physician Report for Elevated Blood Levels All blood lead levels 10 -45 \u00b5g/dL must be reported to ADHS by providers within five working days. For blood lead levels 45 \u00b5g/dL, providers must report within one working day. Physicians are also asked to report non -elevated results for children with previous elevated blood lead levels to assist in ADHS' follow -up for children with EBLLs.

Accordin g to data from Arizona's Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program (CSPMP), there are approximately 10 million Class II -IV pre- scriptions written and 524 million pills dispensed each year. Prescription pain relievers account for more than half of the d rugs dispensed in the state. As the use of these habit -forming drugs grows, so too does the likelihood of adverse outcomes related to misuse an d abuse. Overdose deaths from prescription analgesics increased more than four -fold from 1999 to 2010 in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) declared it an epidemic and Arizona is no exception. Arizona ranked 6th highest in the nation in 2010 for drug overdose deaths and had the 5th highest opioid prescribing rate in the U.S. in 2011. Relieving pain and reducing suffering must be done in a manner that limits the personal and societal harm from prescription d rug misuse and abuse. Arizona created guidelines for the prescription of opiates. These guidelines are intended to help prescribers and patients by reducing the inappropriate use of controlled substances, improving safety, and reducing harm while preserving the vital roles of clini- cians and patients in the management of acute and chronic pain. As an AHCCCS/CMDP provider - you are 1. Required to review the State Board of Arizona Controlled Substances Prescription Monitoring Program (CSPMP) for data related to specific members when prescribing controlled substances and other sedating prescriptions 2. Required to report any suspicion of drug diversion to the following agencies Arizona State Board of Pharmacy DEA, for reporting theft or loss of controlled substances, at https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/webforms/dtlLogin.jsp on the DEA Office of Diversion Control website Local law enforcement and fraud alert networks Office of the Inspector - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - HHS OIG National Hotline, by calling 1 -800- HHS -TIPS (1 -800-447-8477) or TTY 1 -800-377-4950 or by visiting the website https://forms.oig.hhs.gov/hotlineoperations/ CMDP or other AHCCCS Health Plan Our Goal is to increase registration and utilization of the CSPMP. Fluoride Varnish Application - Simple, Easy, Beneficial Fluoride varnish application has been shown to be effective in the prevention of dental caries. It is a commonly used, non -invasive procedure that is well documented in regards to safety. Since there is min- imum risk of ingestion when using fluoride varnish, it has become the preferred fluoride product for chil- dren less than 6 years of age. When fluoride varnish is brushed directly on teeth, it adheres and dries immediately. This simple and direct method delivers high concentration of fluoride (5% NaF) to tooth surfaces making it an ideal preventive agent. AHCCCS formally approved the application of fluoride varnish for primary care physicians in 2014. Since medical providers regularly see children under the age of two, the opportunity exists to initiate early oral health pre ventive ser- vices. AHCCCS will reimburse PCP's for varnish application for members up to second birthday. The frequency of application is every 6 months and the designated billing code is (D1206). Fluoride varnish is safe, effective and proven agent in the prevention of dental decay in young children.

There are many inf lu- ences on one's cultural beliefs, so find out first if the person fits the generalization. Ask patients what they think caused their illness Not every patient thinks a \"germ\" or \"virus\" caused their disease. They may attribute a variety of causes such as stress, spi ritual forces or bodily imbalances. Respect their beliefs, even if they appear strange to you Often patients are afraid to tell a health care provider what home treatments they may be using or what other practitioners t hey may be seeing because of ridicule they have experienced in the past. When and if possible, incorporate into your treatment plan the patient's beliefs about treatment and prevention that are not contraindicated Patients will likely go ahead and use their own treatments anyway, but if you incorporate their beliefs into the treatment pl an, they are more likely to follow your treatment plan. Do not neglect the patient's family In many cultures, important decisions are made by the family, not simply the individual. Involving the family in decision - making process and treatment plan will help gain the patient's compliance with treatment. Respect and do not discount a patient's concern about supernatural influences on his/her health and well being Do not minimize the patient's concerns. Your minimization will not change the patient's beliefs. Listen respectfully to the pa- tient's concern and when possible involve an appropriate spiritual healer/advisor in the patient's care. Learn about the beliefs and practices of the patient populations in your community This will help you better understand your patient's attitudes and behaviors. You may also use this knowledge to question a pa- tient to learn more about their own individual practices.
