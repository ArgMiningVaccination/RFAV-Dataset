Alternatives Issues & Practices ReportForeword Drug and alcohol abuse, drug trafficking, and related criminal activity remain seri- ous problems that affect the lives of most Americans. Under the leadership of PresidentClinton and in cooperation with the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the U.S.Department of Justice has promoted and pursued an approach that combines preven-tion, treatment, and enforcement to break the cycle of substance abuse and crime.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse illustrates this approach through examples of programs that have been adopted successfully by communities across the country.We see this volume as a \"toolbox\" for elected state and local officials, law enforcement,prosecutors, judges, community organizers, and other policymakers. It contains practicalinformation about a range of proven and promising strategies to reduce substance abuse. Several themes emerge from the profiled programs that match the themes found in the companion volume, Promising Strategies to Reduce Gun Violence, published in 1999 by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. One is that the criminaljustice system can and should be used to improve public health as well as public safety.Another is that providing treatment for drug abuse is a cost-effective means of reducingthe heavy burden that both drug abuse and incarceration impose on society. If the proxi-mate cause of much criminal activity is the desperate need to feed a drug habit, if crimi-nal activity is frequently committed under the influence of drugs and alcohol, if thepsychoactive effects of drug abuse lead people to violent and antisocial conduct, thenusing the criminal justice system to hold people accountable for their deeds but also toenable them to change their behavior can lead to reduced recidivism, safer communities,and healthier and more productive citizens. It has long been my goal to develop a continuum of interventions for substance abuse offenders. Incarceration is just punishment for those who commit acts of drugtrafficking, for those who do violence to innocent victims, and for those who repeatedlybehave in a manner that endangers our safety. Many times, however, the primary victimsof substance abuse are the defendants themselves who need help turning their livesaround. Drug court programs, for example, are especially effective in dealing withsubstance-abusing defendants. The prevention, treatment, and law enforcement strate-gies described in the following pages embody this continuum of accountability. These programs also demonstrate how crucial broad collaboration is in forging sound and effective strategies. This collaboration has different components: federal, state,and local governments pooling their resources; education, health, and police officialssharing ideas and data; and government, business, and nonprofit sectors building coali-tions, all in service of the common goal of combating substance abuse. The problemstouch us all, and we all need to be part of the solutions. I am sure that every communitycan find in these pages an example of a program that will work for it. I hope everyonewho reads this will be inspired to dedicate time and energy to support the appropriateorganizations, or to create new ones, to implement these tested and promising strategiesto reduce substance abuse. Janet Reno Attorney GeneralU.S. Department of Justice An OJP Issues & Practices Report vAn OJP Issues & Practices Report viiExecutive Summary Substance abuse is one of the most pervasive problems facing our nation, costing over $275 billion in health care costs, lost productivity, related crime, and other socialcosts, and contributing to over 130,000 deaths each year. To help communitiesaddress the devastating effects of illicit drug and alcohol abuse, Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse has been developed to highlight best practices in prevention, treatment, and law enforcement. Prevention, treatment, and law enforcement strategies, discussed in separate chapters, act in concert with one another, comprehensively addressing substanceabuse in various contexts. Collaboration among law enforcement, health, and socialservice agencies can help reduce demand, which fuels drug trafficking activities, ofteninvolving violence and crime. T reating addicts and preventing the onset of drug usecan complement law enforcement efforts to reduce supply. Expanded research in drug abuse prevention over the last two decades has identi- fied key elements of successful programming, discussed in the Prevention chapter.Recognizing risk and protective factors is an essential component of successful pre-vention programs. T reatment for alcohol and other drug abuse continues to evolve as more is learned about tailoring treatment to specific populations. Advances have been madein pharmacological treatments and in treatment for women, adolescents, and otherspecific populations. Creating a continuum of care from prison into the community,incorporating HIV prevention in treatment, and delivering essential support services,such as job counseling and child care, are elements of the new approaches to sub-stance abuse. Criminal justice can have significant impact in reducing illicit drug and alcohol abuse. Law enforcement initiatives addressing substance abuse and related crime arenow working more intimately with communities to solve local problems. Local lawenforcement also collaborates effectively with federal anti-drug agencies, forming taskforces to combat high rates of drug-related crime. Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse is intended to serve as a guide to communities by identifying the core elements of promising strategies and providingexamples of programs that are making a difference locally. An OJP Issues & Practices Report ixOverview Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse is an assessment of the most effec- tive strategies used nationwide to reduce illicit drug and alcohol abuse and relatedcrime. The report is intended to serve as a guide to communities by identifying thecore elements of promising strategies and illustrating these strategies with examplesof programs that are making a difference locally. Programs were chosen to representurban, suburban, and rural communities. An important trend evident in many of the effective strategies and programs is a close coordination between law enforcement, treatment providers, and preventionprofessionals to address substance abuse and related problems. These partnerships arevital to the success of programming because they minimize redundancies, help tostreamline service delivery, and improve access to expertise and financial resources.All types of initiatives in prevention, treatment, and enforcement seem to work betterand have a greater impact if interagency collaboration is well-developed and well-orchestrated. Such collaborations are vital to providing a continuum of care that caneffectively intervene at all stages of an individual's life, from birth to adulthood, andin all kinds of community institutions, from the school to the local jail. The growing emphasis on \"what works\" among lawmakers and funders requires that communities learn from each other and implement program models with a trackrecord of success. Using programs that are effective in other communities, tailoringthose programs to the needs of the specific locality, and evaluating their success iscritical to creating a sustainable approach. Research in drug abuse prevention has flourished for more than two decades and has identified key elements of successful programming that are discussed in thePrevention chapter. Identifying risk and protective factors and focusing on theresiliency and strengths of youths and adults, for example, have become major focusesof prevention programs. The report outlines five basic prevention strategies: teachingprevention in schools, reaching youths outside school, targeting high-risk groups,building family bonds, and empowering communities. T reatment for alcohol and other drug abuse continues to evolve as more is learned about what works with specific populations. Based on research to date, theNational Institute on Drug Abuse recently developed 13 principles of effective treat-ment (these are discussed later in the report). Four strategies are discussed in theT reatment chapter: treating the family, rehabilitating criminal offenders, assessingand treating juveniles, and connecting with the community. Criminal justice approaches, which often integrate prevention and treatment components, are critical in preventing crime and disorder associated with alcohol andother drug abuse. The changing nature of law enforcement responses to substanceabuse and related crime is demonstrated in local department efforts to work withintheir communities to solve local problems. These trends are evident at the federallevel; the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) within thePromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse Department of Justice, for example, directs substantial resources to local community policing initiatives. In addition, over the past decade alternatives to incarceration thatcombine sanctions, accountability, and treatment for offenders have become increas-ingly popular. The growth of drug courts exemplifies this trend. In 1989, the firstdrug court was established; in 2000, more than 400 courts exist nationwide, andnearly 300 are in the planning stages. The Law Enforcement chapter discusses fivestrategies: community policing, problem-oriented policing, reducing drug availability,alternatives to incarceration, and alcohol-related approaches. Communities looking to implement promising anti-drug approaches should first assess the areas of greatest need. In some communities underage drinking maybe the most prominent problem, in which case prevention, treatment, and enforce-ment activities should be enhanced. Other communities may face problems of vio-lence linked to illicit drug trafficking requiring law enforcement activities to target\"hot spots\" of heightened drug activity. Determining the gaps in services currentlyprovided by and for the community is an essential step. The local health department,police department, and other state and local agencies often track data and servicesthat will help identify community needs. Another consideration for communities is cost. The promising programs high- lighted in this report provide information on the cost of implementing and operatingthe various activities. In addition to cost, other community resources, such as person-nel and readiness, must be considered. Is there an existing agency that can incorpo-rate an effective prevention curriculum into its programming? Does the policedepartment have a strong track record of collaborating with social service agencies?The degree to which a community is galvanized around implementing new programscan have a profound effect on the success of those programs. Most of the promising programs highlighted in the report have been in existence for at least three years, demonstrating their durability. All of the programs have beensuccessful in meeting their goals. For each program the report provides informationvital to community replication, broken down into the following categories: nDescription \u2014outlines the goals and logistics of the program (i.e., who is served and program capacity, what services does the program provide to thecommunity, how are these services provided, etc.); nChallenges \u2014describes the obstacles to implementing and/or operating the pro- gram, and in most cases how those obstacles were overcome or are currentlybeing addressed. In doing this, communities can prepare for the commonchallenges of implementing the programs and begin to address them in thedevelopment stage; nCosts\u2014outlines either the annual budget of the program or the cost of serving an individual over the course of the program. Replication costs are availablefor many of the programs, as are various costs that communities should fore-see when designing a similar program; and nProgram Results \u2014details the effectiveness of the program in meeting goals and objectives. Some programs have been evaluated by external or internal investi-gators using rigorous research designs; however, this standard does not holdtrue for all of the promising approaches detailed in this report. Some programs x An OJP Issues & Practices ReportAn OJP Issues & Practices Report xiwere assessed as promising based on improvement observed in the communi- ty, such as reductions in criminal activity and/or substance abuse. All pro-grams detailed in the report have made positive impacts within theircommunities. Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse aims to provide communities with valuable information on successful efforts to reduce substance abuse and related prob-lems nationwide, and to assist them in selecting strategies and programs that willeffectively address their specific needs.OverviewAn OJP Issues & Practices Report 1Prevention Effective prevention strategies are critically important in community efforts to combat substance abuse. Virtually everyone is susceptible to alcohol and other drugproblems at different points in their lives. Some people, however, are at higher riskfor developing serious addiction because of personal, family, or environmental cir-cumstances. The impact of substance abuse often reaches beyond the abuser to familymembers, friends, co-workers, and society at large. Extensive research during the past two decades has identified a number of pre- vention strategies that measurably reduce drug use, including by those at high risk.These strategies share a common goal: strengthening \"protective factors,\" such aswell-developed social skills, strong family bonds, attachment to school, and activeinvolvement in the community and religious organizations, while reducing \"risk fac-tors\" that increase vulnerability to drug abuse. Recent research suggests that resilienceis also an important factor; even in high risk, adverse circumstances, many people areable to resist drugs. 1 While it is impossible to predict with certainty who will develop alcohol and other drug problems, research has uncovered a great deal about the factors which sig-nificantly increase risk for millions of children ages 10 to 17. Substance abuse by aparent, lack of parental guidance, or a disruptive, abusive family are very strong pre-dictors, as are school failure, early experimentation with drugs, and living in a com-munity where substance abuse and dealing are pervasive. 2While these risk factors are all important predictors, the effect of any single factor can be mitigated by other cir-cumstances. Research indicates that two risk factors produce four times the probabili-ty of problem behaviors. Children facing multiple risks are much more likely to movefrom experimentation to serious substance abuse by the time they are teenagers. 3,4 Promising prevention strategies are often designed to address different levels of risk. Universal prevention efforts, like drug education, target all youth without identi- fying those at particularly high levels of risk. Selective interventions concentrate on those who are particularly vulnerable to drugs because of personal, family, and com-munity risk factors. Indicated interventions are intensive efforts aimed at youth who are already experimenting with alcohol and other drugs or exhibit other risk-relatedbehavior. 5Effective prevention promotes the protective factors that reduce the poten- tial for substance abuse and other closely linked behaviors, such as truancy, delin-quency, and early pregnancy. Successful prevention strategies also incorporate the cultural, gender, and age- specific needs of participants. Prevention efforts must address all stages of life; frominfancy to adulthood, prevention can reduce both the use and abuse of alcohol andother drugs. Although individual programs differ widely, the federal Center forSubstance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) has identified six basic approaches to preventionwhich are described in Understanding Substance Abuse Prevention: Toward the 21st Century: A Primer on Effective Programs 6:2 An OJP Issues & Practices Report2 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportnInformation dissemination is designed to increase knowledge and alter attitudes aboutissues related to alcohol, tobacco, and otherdrug use and abuse; nPrevention education teaches participants criti- cal personal and social skills that promotehealth and well-being among youths and helpthem avoid substance abuse; nAlternative approaches assume that youth who participate in drug-free activities will haveimportant developmental needs met throughthese activities rather than through drug-related activities; nProblem identification and referral involves rec- ognizing youths who have already tried drugsor developed substance use problems andreferring them to appropriate treatmentoptions. This is particularly important forhigh-risk youth; nCommunity-based process enhances community resource involvement in substance abuse pre-vention, for example, by building interagencycoalitions and training community membersand agencies in substance abuse education andprevention; and nEnvironmental approaches attempt to promote policies that reduce risk factors and/or increaseprotective factors related to substance abuse,such as community laws prohibiting alcoholand tobacco advertising in close proximity toschools. This chapter discusses a wide range of promising approaches that involve schools, families, and com-munities in prevention efforts that use many of theelements identified by CSAP . The CSAP-identifiedkey elements are not mutually exclusive, and most ofthe programs detailed in this report include morethan one key element. Effective strategies include pre-vention education; mentoring other strengthening families; andempowering communities. The programs describedbelow are examples that can help communities tailorstrategies to their specific needs.I. Teaching Prevention in Schools Schools can play a powerful role in prevention as teachers and administrators often are the first todetect warning signs of possible drug problems, suchas poor school attendance or declining academicperformance. Effective school programs teach young people to resist drugs by developing personal and social skills,such as decision making, stress management, commu-nication, social interaction, conflict resolution, andassertiveness. In addition, these programs can enhanceawareness and resistance skills. Students learn thatmost of their peers do not use drugs, and they learnto recognize social and peer influences on drug use.With this new awareness, youths are better able toresist the pressure to use drugs. 7 Prevention efforts should begin early and contin- ue through adolescence, when pressure to drink,smoke, and use other drugs greatly increases. Withoutreinforcing skills and anti-drug norms, behavioralresults diminish. Programs enhanced with \"boostersessions,\" activities which follow up on the initial pro-gram, help prevent or delay the initiation of drinking,smoking, and using other drugs. 8Delayed initiation is beneficial, giving children time to develop social com-petence and resistance skills. According to theNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,each year that children avoid alcohol use significantlydecreases their risk of future dependence. 9The Department of Health and Human Services reportsthat any delay in beginning to smoke during the earlyteen years improves the future prognosis for quitting.Delayed onset of smoking is also associated with alower incidence of disease and death. 10 Prevention efforts in schools are designed to serve universal (the general population), selective (thoseidentified as at risk), or indicated (those alreadyexhibiting signs of problem behavior) groups of stu-dents. Depending on the targeted population, preven-tion messages range in intensity. For example, LifeSkills T raining, a universal program, teaches personal, social, and drug resistance skills in weekly 45-minutesessions. In contrast, Reconnecting Youth, designedfor indicated high school students, involves partici- pants in a daily class focused on reducing or control-ling drug use.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseAccording to Making the Grade: A Guide to School Drug Prevention Programs11, successful school- based drug prevention programs incorporate a varietyof key elements: nhelp students recognize internal pressures, likeanxiety and stress, and external pressures, likepeer attitudes and advertising, that influencethem to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; ndevelop personal, social, and refusal skills toresist these pressures; nteach that using alcohol, tobacco, and otherdrugs is not the norm among teenagers, evenif students believe that \"everyone is doing it\"; nprovide developmentally-appropriate materialand activities, including information about theshort-term effects and long-term consequencesof alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; nuse interactive teaching techniques, such asrole plays, discussions, brainstorming, andcooperative learning; ncover necessary prevention elements in at leastten sessions a year (with a minimum of threeto five booster sessions in two succeedingyears); nactively involve the family and the communi-ty; and ninclude teacher training and support, and con-tain material that is easy for teachers to imple-ment and culturally relevant for students. School prevention efforts should also aim to reduce school disorder and improve children's atti-tudes about school. Research over the past twodecades indicates that active involvement in schoolhelps protect young people from many problembehaviors, including substance abuse. 12A positive atmosphere helps engage students in school, givingthem a sense of identity and reducing the likelihoodthat they will drop out or participate in delinquentbehavior, two factors that can increase risk for latersubstance abuse problems. Although school programs can demonstrate impressive results in prevention, families and commu-nities shape the larger social context in which childrenPrevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 3make decisions about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. According to the 1997 report of the NationalLongitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, close rela-tionships with parents and teachers are powerful pro-tective factors for teens. The closer teens are to theirparents and the more connected they feel to school,the less likely they are to smoke, drink, or use otherdrugs. 13 Prevention is most effective when school lessons are reinforced by a clear, consistent social messagethat teen alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use isharmful and unacceptable. 14In many communities, police officers work as school resource officers (SRO)to monitor students, provide advice and preventioninformation, and link students to supervised recre-ational activities, mentoring, and other services. The following programs demonstrate the effec- tiveness of these essential elements in building com-prehensive school-based strategies to prevent alcohol,tobacco, and other drug use. Child Development Project, Cupertino, California Program Type: Teaching Prevention in Schools. Target Audience: Elementary school students, their parents and teachers.Years in Operation: 1992-present. Program Goals: To increase student attachment to school, thereby reducing risk factors that contributeto substance abuse and other high-risk behaviors.Contact Information: Denise Wood, Developmental Studies Center, Oakland, CA, 800-666-7270. Description: The Child Development Project (CDP) is a philosophical approach to interacting withelementary school students, their families, teachers,and school administrators. The program focuses onan entire school rather than targeting only high-riskstudents. Although CDP does not address substanceabuse directly, its character building program isdesigned to reduce risk factors for alcohol and otherdrug use. Since 1992, CDP has expanded to approxi-mately 100 schools in six states and is recognized bythe Center for Substance Abuse Prevention as a prom-ising High Risk Youth program and by the NationalAssociation of Elementary School Principals.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 4 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportD.J. Sedgewick Elementary School in Cupertino, California, was one of the pilot schools to implementthe program in 1992. Teachers at Sedgewick wereunhappy with the school's antagonistic atmosphereand wanted a more effective way to discipline stu-dents. The same children were repeatedly getting intotrouble, and there was no evidence that the existingforms of punishment were working. The staff choseCDP because it aims to create a school community inwhich students feel safe and cared for and are encour-aged to develop their academic and practical skills.The program increases students' attachment to theschool community and establishes a system of positivereinforcement which reduces risk factors and pro-motes protective factors. CDP has four basic principles: build supportive relationships; attend to the social and ethical dimen-sions of learning; honor students' intrinsic motiva-tion; and teach in ways that support students'learning styles. These principles are expressed throughfive program components. The first component is areading and language arts curriculum which addressessocial and ethical values. Culturally-appropriate booksare selected according to the student group, and areread aloud to give students a shared experience. Thesecond component of the program is collaborativeclassroom learning, which emphasizes workingtogether and provides students with meaningful, chal-lenging tasks. Component three, developmental disci-pline, is a classroom approach to creating caringrelationships among all members of the classroom.Teachers use problem-solving techniques rather thanreward and punishment to teach students responsibili-ty and competence. The fourth component gets par-ents involved with their children's education byassigning homework tasks which the family mustcomplete together. The final component is a schoolwide activities program that creates a sense of schoolcommunity. One activity, the Buddies program, pairsyoung students with older partners for academic andsocial activities. Challenges: CDP can only work if the principal, teachers, and staff members all commit to followingthe program design. The program requires a changein the overall atmosphere of the school and consistentimplementation. For example, if one teacher contin-ues to discipline students by sending them to theprincipal's office while another works with students tosolve problems, the program will not be fully effec- tive. Sedgewick was fortunate to have the support ofthe entire school staff, and the school screens prospec-tive teachers to ensure they are willing to follow theCDP philosophy. Costs and Funding Sources: Instructional and curricular materials for the program cost approximate-ly $550 per classroom teacher. T raining by CDP staffmembers costs approximately $40,000 per year.Sedgewick receives approximately $125,000 in grantmoney annually for initiatives aimed at improving lit-eracy, including CDP . Program Results: An internal evaluation of CDP conducted by researchers from the DevelopmentalStudies Center in Oakland, California, showeddecreased substance use among fifth and sixth gradersin schools that fully implemented the program. Theevaluation was conducted in six communities:Cupertino, Salinas, and San Francisco, California;Louisville, Kentucky; Dade County, Florida; andWhite Plains, New York. In each city, two controlschools and two program schools were examined, anddata were collected from classroom observation, stu-dent and teacher questionnaires, and student achieve-ment scores. Over four years the following changes indrug use were observed: nAlcohol use among students fell from 48 per-cent to 37 percent in program schools whilerising from 36 percent to 38 percent in con-trol schools; nCigarette use declined from 25 percent of stu-dents to 17 percent in program schools whiledeclining from 17 percent to 14 percent incontrol schools; and nMarijuana use declined from 7 percent of stu-dents to 5 percent in program schools whilerising from 4 percent to 6 percent in controlschools. Students also reported that after the program was implemented they enjoyed school more, were moremotivated to learn, were better skilled at resolvingconflicts, and felt more socially competent. Another accomplishment of the Child Develop- ment Project is that it changed the atmosphere atSedgewick. Students are now more excited aboutPrevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 5learning and feel more a part of the school communi- ty. Teachers report that parents have also commentedon the change in the school. Life Skills Training, Garland, Texas Program Type: Teaching Prevention in Schools. Target Audience: Middle school students. Years in Operation: 1997-present. Program Goals: To teach alcohol and other drug prevention skills to all middle school students.Contact Information: Janet Harrison, Chief Executive Officer, Greater Dallas Council on Alcohol and DrugAbuse, 214-522-8600; research information, GilbertBotvin, Institute for Prevention Research, 212-746-1270; curriculum information, 800-636-3415,www.lifeskillstraining.com. Description: Life Skills T raining (LST) is one of the best-evaluated substance abuse prevention pro-grams available, having been evaluated in 12 rigorousfield trials over the past two decades. LST providesinformation on alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana andaddresses substance use risk and protective factors. In1997, Life Skills T raining was implemented in 13middle schools in the Garland Independent SchoolDistrict. In the 1999-2000 school year the programreached approximately 3,968 sixth graders, 3,789 sev-enth graders, and 3,851 eighth graders. A universal approach designed for all students, the curriculum targets middle and junior high schoolstudents at the age when substance use increases mostdramatically. The three-year curriculum consists of 15sessions in the first year (sixth or seventh grade), tensessions in the second year, and five to eight sessionsin the third year. The curriculum uses a variety ofinteractive techniques, including discussions, brain-storming, role playing, and skill rehearsal. In manyschools, teachers act as facilitators, presenting effectivebehaviors, coaching students, and providing positivefeedback. In Garland, the Greater Dallas Council onAlcohol and Drug Abuse (GDCADA) runs LST andemploys two full-time program staff (a ProgramManager and LST Specialist) and approximatelyeight part-time LST instructors to teach the courseto students. The content of the program falls into three gen- eral categories. The first module contains informationabout tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use, including the immediate effects of these substances on the body,using a classroom exercise. Students learn, for exam-ple, that contrary to myth, smoking does not helppeople relax. Nicotine is a stimulant which causeshands to tremble and the heart to beat faster. The second module develops personal or self- management skills. LST provides students with a vari-ety of techniques for effectively managing anxiety,including deep breathing, mental rehearsal, and mus-cle relaxation. LST provides students with a formulafor making competent decisions, provides training ingoal setting and planning for the future, and involvesstudents in semester-long projects that help themachieve individual goals. The third module of the curriculum hones stu- dents' social skills. To help students feel comfortablein social situations and less vulnerable to peer pres-sure, LST provides training in general social tech-niques, such as conversational skills and cross-gendercommunication. In order to help students effectivelyresist peer pressure, the curriculum provides studentswith training to tactfully resist pressure to use tobac-co, alcohol, or other drugs, as well as how to assertthemselves and express their feelings directly. Challenges: One of the challenges to implement- ing Life Skills T raining in Garland and other sites isstarting the program at the beginning of the schoolyear, when class schedules and routines are often influx. A related challenge is scheduling LST classes sothat they do not interfere with state-mandated test-ing. In fact, many schools report that one of themajor challenges to implementing the Life SkillsT raining Program is committing the time to completethe program. With many competing demands onclass time, it can be difficult to secure the 15 class ses-sions needed to complete the program in the firstyear. However, studies have clearly shown that thesuccess of LST depends on implementation of theprogram as designed. Costs and Funding Sources: In Garland, LST is funded through the Texas Commission on Alcoholand Drug Abuse, which provides $250,000 for theprogram in all 13 schools. This amount covers cur-riculum materials for program instructors and stu-dents, and instructor salaries and trainings. Schoolsusing teachers to run the program do not have to hire6 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportadditional personnel, so costs are limited to curriculum materials and teacher training. The cost to provide LSTto one class of 30 students for one year is $250. Addi-tional costs for training teachers is $2,000 per day for aminimum of one to two days of training. Program Results: The LST program has consis- tently been shown to reduce cigarette smoking, prob-lem drinking, and marijuana use, with impact slightlydiminished by the six-year follow-up. Moreover, thesize of these reductions has been significant, withreductions in smoking, drinking, and marijuana useranging from 50 percent to 75 percent in the partici-pating schools, compared with nonparticipating con-trol schools. The program has also been found toeffectively decrease use of inhalants, narcotics, andhallucinogens and increase students' knowledge andattitudes about smoking, drinking, and marijuana use. These effects have been observed in schools where the program was implemented by health pro-fessionals, older peer leaders, and regular classroomteachers. Other evaluation studies have demonstratedthe effectiveness of the program in both urban andsuburban schools, and among white, African-American, and Hispanic youth. LST has received numerous professional awards and endorsements from professional groups, includ-ing the American Medical Association and theAmerican Psychological Association. Most recently,LST was one of two programs highlighted by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention as\"Programs That Work.\" Reconnecting Youth, Midland, Texas Program Type: Teaching Prevention in Schools Target Audience: High-risk high school students. Years in Operation: 1997-present. Program Goals: To increase school performance and decrease drug use and emotional distress.Contact Information: National, Nan Macy, Public Information Specialist, University of WashingtonSchool of Nursing, 206-685-4733. Texas, LynWhite-Giesler, 915-552-7455. Description: Reconnecting Youth is a school- based drug prevention program targeting high-riskhigh school students; the program is designed toreduce drug use and aggression, as well as academic failure and dropping out of school. The school dis-tricts of Midland and Odessa, Texas, implementedReconnecting Youth in four schools in 1997; approxi-mately 200 students participate each year. Reconnecting Youth seeks to reduce risk, build resiliency, and provide training in communicationskills, anger management, social problem solving,social resistance skills, and peace building. Recon-necting Youth targets students who fall behind theirpeers in school, have high absenteeism, experience adrop in grades, or drop out of school. ReconnectingYouth includes a semester-long course, school bond-ing activities, and a school system crisis response plan.The Reconnecting Youth class is taught for 55 min-utes each day and includes four modules: Decision-Making, Personal Control, Self-Esteem Enhancement,and Interpersonal Communication. The program istaught by teachers, other school personnel, or outsidespecialists. In Texas, Reconnecting Youth is run by aprogram specialist rather than school personnel. Theprogram requires a teacher-to-student ratio of 1:12, aselection process for both participants and facilitators,and proper facilitator training. Reconnecting Youth has three primary goals: (1) increase academic performance by enhancingschool bonding, school attendance, and grades, andincreasing the number of pre-college courses taken;(2) decrease drug involvement by increasing controlover drug use; and (3) decrease emotional distress bylessening risk factors, such as depression, and increas-ing protective factors, such as self-esteem. Challenges: The most difficult part of imple- menting the program in Texas was obtaining thecooperation of the schools. School officials are oftenreluctant to release pretest information, including stu-dents' attendance records and grades, which is criticalto evaluating. School officials were more cooperativeafter the Texas Education Association authorized thata half credit be given to students taking the course.Texas is the only state that gives academic credit forthe course. Costs and Funding Sources: Costs vary depend- ing on how the program is implemented. If schoolstaff teach the program, the only required costs aretraining, materials, and student incentives. The initialfive-day training for facilitators costs $500/day for sixPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abusepeople, plus trainer travel and expenses. A recom- mended one-day follow-up training every six monthscosts $750/day plus trainer expenses. The curriculumalone costs $139. In addition, the Texas programemploys specialists to teach the program, four facilita-tors, and one director. The Texas Commission onAlcohol and Drug Abuse provides an annual grant of$235,000 to operate Reconnecting Youth in fourMidland and Odessa schools. Program Results: Curriculum developers have conducted three studies using external evaluators thatclearly demonstrate that the program results inimproved academic performance; decreases drug use;reduces anger, depression, aggression, hopelessness,suicidal behaviors, and stress; decreases bonding todeviant peers; and improves self-esteem, self-control,bonding to school, and social support. Evaluations ofthe program have observed reduced use of cocaine,hallucinogens, opiates, depressants, tranquilizers,stimulants, and inhalants. Tobacco, alcohol, and mari-juana use were not affected. The program also re-duced drug use control problems (e.g., used morethan intended) and adverse drug use consequences(e.g., feeling guilty or problems with friends or familyas a result of substance use). Reconnecting Youth received an \"A\" in Drug Strategies' reports Making the Grade: A Guide to School Drug Prevention Programs and Safe Schools Safe Students. The program is also recommended by the U.S. Department of Education, was recognized by theNational Institute on Drug Abuse as one of the year'stop three prevention programs in 1996, and is consid-ered a model program by the Center for SubstanceAbuse Prevention. In Midland and Odessa, students in Reconnect- ing Youth report improved communication with theirteachers. Teachers report that problem students haveshown improved performance and control on howthey behave and interact with others. At the end ofthe school year the students participate in a gradua-tion ceremony attended by the school board andmedia.II. Reaching Youths Outside School After-school hours are high-risk periods for alco- hol and illicit drug use, unprotected sex, and violenceamong youths. Approximately one-third of all violentjuvenile crimes occur between the hours of 3 p.m.and 7 p.m., when many children are unsupervised. 15 Targeted programs during these vulnerable hours canhelp prevent, reduce, or delay the onset of alcohol,tobacco, and other drug use. After-school programscan also reinforce social skills learned in school andat home. Many communities are implementing after-school programs that include substance abuse prevention.Activities range from programs that offer alternativeactivities with a drug prevention message to programsfor high-risk youth that involve more intense inter-vention, specifically addressing risk and protectivefactors for substance abuse. Police departments have taken an active role in developing after-school programs to keep youths outof trouble. Recently, the police chief of MountlakeTerrace, Washington, won a National Crime Preven-tion Council award for his role in creating theNeutral Zone, a youth center which provides an arrayof youth services, including substance abuse counsel-ing. Five years after creating the Neutral Zone, gang-related crime dropped more than 90 percent. Theprogram has been replicated in numerous other citiesin Washington state. Millions of American children participate in ele- mentary, middle, or high school sports programs, andmany others join community teams, providing primeopportunities to reach large numbers of youth withprevention messages. Coaches and other supervisorscan be trained to recognize warning signs of substanceabuse and deal with at-risk athletes. For example, theDrug Enforcement Administration's Team Up Anti-Drug Sports Program trains coaches and schooladministrators to take active roles in prevention andeducation in their schools. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 7Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 78 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 8 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportCreating a safe place for youths to gather after school can help protect them from risk factors in thecommunity, in peer groups, or at home. For example,the Safe Haven in Madison, Wisconsin, provides edu-cational opportunities and supervised recreation for150 at-risk elementary school children, teaching themconflict resolution and other behavioral skills, andinvolving their parents in the program. The programwas developed through a partnership involving thecity, the local school district, and a nonprofit commu-nity center. Mentoring is an increasingly popular prevention/ intervention strategy that helps youths deal with therisks they face in their daily lives. While informalmentoring occurs naturally for children who havepositive adult influences, many young people havefew positive adult role models. Formal mentoringprograms assist these children by structuring one-to-one relationships with caring adults, that can reducerisk factors for substance abuse, such as social isola-tion and insufficient supervision. A positive adult rolemodel also offers new perspectives to youths living insituations rife with substance abuse and violence. 16 Well-developed and executed mentoring pro- grams can effectively reduce drug use. A 1995 nation-al evaluation of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America,which connects middle class adults with disadvan-taged youths, found that young people in the pro-gram were almost 50 percent less likely to begin usingdrugs than their peers not involved in the program.An even stronger effect was found for minority LittleBrothers and Sisters, who were 70 percent less likelyto initiate drug use than similar minority youths. 17In response to the success of mentoring programs, theOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention(OJJDP) developed the Juvenile Mentoring Project(JUMP) in 1994 to support mentoring programs forat-risk youths in communities across the country.OJJDP highlights several elements of effective men-toring programs: nCreating collaboration between community-based providers and local education agencies toimprove school performance and reduce schooldrop out rates and juvenile delinquency; nPerforming thorough background checks forall volunteer mentors to establish a safe envi-ronment for participating children;nAssessing young participants carefully soappropriate matches can be established thatmaximize opportunities for success; nDesigning mentor and project activities thatenrich and enhance youth opportunities andexperiences; and nGathering and routinely reporting programdata for evaluation purposes. The U.S. Navy's Drug Demand Reduction Task Force (DDRTF) developed the Drug Education forYouth initiative (DEFY), a mentoring program thatworks with Weed and Seed neighborhoods. DEFY,targeting youths ages 9-12, improves youths' self-image, communication skills, and awareness of thedangers of alcohol and other drug use through week-end camping and continued mentoring. The first twoDEFY programs began in 1993 in Pensacola, Florida,and Oakland, California, and there are now 65DEFY/Weed and Seed sites. Providing constructive and healthy activities for youths\u2014coupled with substance abuse prevention\u2014can offset the attraction to alcohol, tobacco, or otherdrugs. Community youth development programs,such as Boys and Girls Clubs, can integrate preven-tion education into traditional activities. A 1992 eval-uation of such programs offered in public housingdevelopments found greater reductions in drug useamong participating youngsters than among youthsnot involved. 18 The following programs are examples of how communities have used mentoring initiatives andyouth development programs to prevent substanceabuse by reaching youths after school. Big Brothers & Sisters of Wichita, Kansas Program Type: Reaching Youths Outside School. Target Audience: Children ages 5-17 at risk for substance abuse.Years in Operation: 1969-present. Program Goals: To prevent destructive behavior and promote positive attitudes and habits among youths.Contact Information: In Wichita, Mike Keller, 316-263-3300; National office, Jerry Lapham,215-567-7000; national@bbbsa.org; www.bbbsa.org.Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 9An OJP Issues & Practices Report 9Description: For nearly a century, Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America (BBBSA) has been provid-ing adult support and friendship to children. Througha careful matching process, volunteers interact regularlywith youngsters in one-to-one relationships. Of the514 local BBBSA agencies nationwide, the BigBrothers & Sisters program in Wichita, Kansas, is thelargest, with over 1,300 matches of adult mentors witharea youths in 1999. Wichita, like the other local agen-cies, uses a case management approach developed bythe national organization. Case managers screen chil-dren and volunteers, make and supervise matches, andhandle match closures. In Wichita, each case managerhandles 65 cases; monthly contacts with volunteers,children, and parents are made to ensure success. Little Brothers and Sisters are referred by educa- tors, social workers, counselors, parents, and others,and are considered at risk of substance abuse and oth-er destructive behavior. The goal of the program is toprevent such problems and promote positive habitsand attitudes through support, role-modeling, andexposure to healthy activities. Volunteers make a year-long, once-a-week commitment to their matches.Youngsters in the program range in age from 5-17; 83percent of them come from single parent homes, 76percent live at or below the poverty level, 54 percenthave been abused or neglected, and 52 percent comefrom alcoholic and/or drug addicted families. Servingchildren of substance-abusing parents is crucial, sincethey are at high risk; children of alcoholics, for exam-ple, are four times more likely to develop alcoholismthan other youths. In addition to growing its core mentor numbers, the organization is expanding its programming toprovide on-site mentoring in schools and at Boys andGirls Clubs. The agency is also planning to imple-ment outreach programs targeting Hispanic mentorsand youths, senior citizen mentors, and a program incollaboration with community organizations and thepolice department aimed specifically at alcohol,tobacco, and other drug prevention. The success and popularity of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America can be attributed to its rigorouspublished standards and required procedures, includ-ing mandatory volunteer orientation; volunteerscreening, involving a background check, extensiveinterview, and home assessment; youth assessment,which involves parent and child interviews and a home assessment; carefully considered matches; andongoing supervision. The program was named aModel Program in Blueprints for Violence Prevention by the Center for the Study and Prevention ofViolence at the University of Colorado. Challenges: The biggest challenge in Wichita is recruiting volunteers. Currently, there are approxi-mately 700 boys and girls awaiting matches. Whilethe organization needs both male and female volun-teers to meet demand, male volunteers are especiallyhard to get. Little Brothers wait an average of twoyears, while African American Little Brothers wait anaverage of three years. To address this challenge, theprogram has made strides in finding volunteers byworking with local companies and universities torecruit mentors. Advertisements are also posted onbillboard space donated to the organization. Whilethe waiting list is still long, it has decreased signifi-cantly from previous years. Costs and Funding Sources: The national aver- age cost within the BBBSA system of making andsupporting one adult and child match is $1,000 ayear, and includes recruitment and training of volun-teers, administrative costs, employee salaries, and vari-ous activities. The annual budget in Wichita is $2.5million. Funding comes from three main sources: theUnited Way; in-kind and cash donations, includinggrants from private foundations and state, city, andcounty government; and revenue from an annualfundraiser, Bowl For Kids Sake, which raised over$600,000 in 1999. Program Results: An evaluation of eight local BBBSA agencies, including the one in Wichita, foundvolunteer mentors had the greatest impact preventingalcohol and other drug abuse when comparing partic-ipating youths with similar nonparticipating youths.In 1992 and 1993, nearly 1,000 boys and girls ineight cities (including Wichita), ages 10 through 16,entered into an evaluation study to determine theeffectiveness of BBBSA. Half of the children werematched with a mentor, while the other half wereassigned to a waiting list or control group. On aver-age, the matched children met with their mentorsabout three times a month for at least one year.Researchers found that 18 months later, the LittleBrothers and Little Sisters were:n46 percent less likely to begin using illicit drugs; n27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol;and n53 percent less likely to skip school. nMinority youths were 70 percent less likelythan their peers to initiate illicit drug use. The evaluation was conducted by Public/Private Ventures, a national research organization based inPhiladelphia. In addition to Wichita, evaluated pro-grams were located in Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,Minnesota; Rochester, New York; Columbus, Ohio;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Houston and SanAntonio, Texas. A major accomplishment in Wichita was meeting the goal of 1,000 active matches by the year 2000,making the Wichita program (which was already thelargest per capita BBBSA site) the largest overall sitenationwide. The success of the program has prompteda state-funded initiative to create satellite Big Brothersand Sisters facilities in all 105 Kansas counties.According to local Wichita data: n0.5 percent of Little Sisters become pregnant,compared to 5.5 percent of area girls; n1 percent of participants are arrested, com-pared to 7.6 percent of local youths; and n60 percent of participants show improvementin grades, 57 percent in school attendance,and 61 percent in relationships with teachers. Self-Expression Teen Theater, Toledo, Ohio Program Type: Reaching Youths Outside School. Target Audience: High-risk minority adolescents. Years in Operation: 1986-present. Program Goals: To provide teenagers with information on substance use so they can make healthy decisions.Contact Information: Charles Muhammad, Executive Director, 419-242-2255. Description: Self-Expression Teen Theater (SETT) trains young people to educate their peers about thedangers of alcohol and other drug use, premature sexualactivity, and other risky behaviors, and helps youthsPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse explore positive alternative activities. The program was begun in 1986 in response to a needs assessment whichrevealed that Hispanics and African Americans inToledo had high rates of alcohol and other drug use.Since it began, SETT has trained over 1,200 peer edu-cators, given more than 500 performances, and con-ducted over 200 youth-led workshops focusing onsubstance abuse and its relation to violence. SETT targets primarily Hispanic and African American youths ages 11-18 to be peer educators.Peer educators conceive, write, and perform skits ontopics including substance abuse, teen pregnancy, sui-cide, violence, and academic failure. Performancesillustrate the importance of communication betweenyoung people and adults, and provide youths in theaudience with information on treatment and preven-tion services in their community where they can seekhelp. The troupe performs in schools, churches, pub-lic housing projects, and malls. SETT performers receive 80 hours of training cov- ering substance abuse, violence prevention, health edu-cation, community resources, communication, andperforming arts. Ten hours of training are dedicatedto culturally specific information. Peer educators aretrained by experts in the community, such as certifiedalcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse counselors. Parents of SETT members are highly involved in the program. The Parent Advisory Board meetsmonthly to review group training and activities andexplore ideas for further programming and develop-ment. Representatives from community organizationsproviding services for youths are often present at theboard meetings, which allows parents to remain up-to-date on available community resources. SETT's How-To-T raining Manual and consulta- tion services are available to communities and organi-zations interested in replicating the program. Challenges: One of the implementation chal- lenges for SETT was finding the most efficient andeffective way to involve local agencies in the programand to take advantage of their expertise and knowl-edge. Local and state agencies and organizations wereinvited to make presentations during the 80 houryouth peer training, and now 14 organizations,including the police department and children's servic-es agencies are regularly present at training sessions.An additional 73 organizations are involved in the 10 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportAbuse Prevention (CSAP) has identified seven factors contributing to resilience. These factors, described inUnderstanding Substance Abuse Prevention: Toward the21st century: A Primer on Effective Programs 20, include: nA strong relationship with a parent or caringadult who provides a consistent nurturingenvironment; nFeelings of success and self-respect; nStrong internal and external resources, such asgood physical health, self-esteem, a sense ofhumor, and a supportive network that includesfamily, school, and community; nSocial skills, including good communicationand networking skills, and the ability to makegood decisions; nProblem-solving skills that help children over-come obstacles; nHope that adverse circumstances can be over-come with perseverance and hard work; and nSurviving previous stressful situations. Parental substance abuse is one of the strongest predictors for alcohol and other drug problemsamong youth. Children of alcoholics, for example,are four times more likely than others to develop alco-holism later in life. 21Targeting prevention services to particularly vulnerable young people is crucial. KidsConnection, a prevention program in Cincinnati,Ohio, has won national awards for its programs thattarget children of alcoholics and other drug abusers.The program helps children understand addiction,teaches skills, and encourages youths to cope withoutalcohol or other drugs. Kids Connection works withlocal treatment facilities, teachers, and mental healthprofessionals to identify children in need. Some groups, such as juvenile offenders, are at greater risk to become substance abusers. Interven-tions designed for this population can work in varioussettings, including correctional facilities and residen-tial treatment centers. Children with emotional andbehavioral problems are also considered at high risk,as they are significantly more likely to have alcoholand other drug abuse problems than youths in gener-al. 22Youngsters involved in the foster care system are another target population for prevention services,since their families often have histories of substanceprogram in various ways. Another problem, which is ongoing, is the struggle to find and retain qualifiedemployees willing to work in the inner city. AsSETT's positive effects on the community becomebetter known, more people have become interested inworking in the program. Costs and Funding Sources: The average annual program budget of $138,472 covers all expenses,including a full-time project director, a full-timeoffice manager, a part-time project coordinator, con-tract workers such as coaches and training assistants,evaluation, rent, and program materials, such as costumes. SETT receives funding from the OhioDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services($100,000), City of Toledo Department of Neigh-borhoods ($30,000), and the Marshall Field Foun-dation ($2,000). Additional funding comes from general donations received from performances. Program Results: In the program's target area of Toledo, 60 percent of all students graduate from pub-lic high schools. However, 93 percent of SETT peereducators graduate from high school, and 87 percentare attending or have graduated from college. The program is currently being evaluated by researchers at the Wright State University School ofMedicine in Dayton, Ohio. Results of the evaluationshould be available in fall 2000. SETT won Most Outstanding Exemplary Program Award for Prevention from the OhioDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Servicesin 1993 and 1999, and the Exemplary ProgramAward from the Center for Substance Abuse Preven-tion in 1993. The program has been replicated inLima, Ohio, and Atlanta, Georgia. III. Reaching High-Risk Groups Targeted prevention services can effectively reach people at high risk for drug problems who may beimpervious to universal prevention efforts offered inschools and other community settings. High-risk pop-ulations include children of substance abusers, preg-nant teens, and juvenile offenders. These efforts,which often involve home visits, counseling, and par-ent training, enhance resilience and promote individ-ual strengths. 19The federal Center for Substance An OJP Issues & Practices Report 11Preventionand the first group of 100 mothers will soon gradu- ate. Prenatal and Infancy Home Visitation by Nurseshas been identified as a Model Program in Blueprints for Violence Prevention by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University ofColorado. The program hires and trains registered nurses to conduct home visits with pregnant women beforedelivery and to continue visiting once or twice a weekuntil the child is two. One reason for the program'ssuccess is that nurses have a caseload limited to 25families, allowing them to bond with the mothers andchildren and give them individual attention. The pro-gram focuses on five aspects of development: health,parenting skills, environmental health (living condi-tions), life skills, and the creation of solid supportnetworks. Women are encouraged to seek higher edu-cation, reduce their alcohol, tobacco, and other druguse, and cultivate other positive behaviors. Nursesinvolve family and friends in the program and refermothers to other community health services whennecessary. Detailed records are kept on each family\u2014their needs, services provided, and the family'sprogress and outcomes. Mothers are referred mainlythrough area health organizations; much of therecruitment in Oakland is done through the Women,Infant and Child (WIC) program and through thecounty's health maintenance organization. The program was evaluated at three sites with three different population groups: Elmira, New York,in the 1970s (primarily white women); Memphis,Tennessee, in the 1990s (primarily African Americanwomen); and Denver in 1994 (primarily Mexican-American women). While the three programs haveended, results in all of the studies were promising.Based on the success of the earlier programs, theDepartment of Justice began funding new programsites three years ago. Challenges: The city of Oakland had no central- ized tracking system for at-risk mothers, which maderecruiting mothers a challenge. Program staff had tocontact each agency working with the target popula-tion, inform them about the program, and set up arecruitment system. Recruiting is complicated becausemany mothers are not willing to let nurses into theirhomes on a weekly basis for two years. AlthoughOakland originally targeted 200 mothers for the pro-gram, only 112 agreed to participate. Staff have takenabuse. 23Initiatives to assist foster families can be inte- grated into programs for abused, neglected, orphaned,or troubled adolescents. As substance abuse and sexual activity often over- lap, targeting prevention/intervention services to preg-nant teens and young women can benefit both thewomen and their children. Home visits by nurses toteach young mothers healthy lifestyles is one effectiveapproach. The national Prenatal and Infancy HomeVisitation by Nurses Program conducts intensive andcomprehensive home visits during a woman's preg-nancy and during the first two years after childbirth.An evaluation of the program found significantlyreduced substance abuse among mothers and childrenin the program compared with similar nonpartici-pants. 24In-home visits are designed to ensure women's prenatal health and pregnancy outcomes; improve thecare provided to infants and toddlers; and facilitatewomen's own personal development by helping themplan future pregnancies, continue their education,and participate in the work force. The following examples demonstrate successful prevention programs that target high-risk individuals. Prenatal and Infancy Home Visitation by Nurses, Oakland, California Program Type: Targeting High-risk Groups. Target Audience: Low-income first-time mothers and their children under age two.Years in Operation: 1997-present. Program Goals: Improve the health of pregnant women and their babies.Contact Information: Peggy Hill, of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University ofColorado, 303-864-5207. Description: The Prenatal and Infancy Home Visitation by Nurses program assists low-income,first-time mothers by helping them improve their pre-natal health, and after childbirth provides care toinfants and toddlers to ensure the children's healthand development. The program also helps womenplan future pregnancies, continue their education,and participate in the work force. Originally pilotedin the early 1970s in Elmira, New York, the programis currently being replicated in 19 states. In Oakland,California, the program began in November 1997,Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 12 An OJP Issues & Practices Report12 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportPrevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 13these lessons into account, and today there is better coordination among agencies providing services toyoung mothers. Costs: Program costs vary depending on local nurses' salaries. In Oakland the average salary of aregistered nurse is $65,000 plus benefits; the siteemploys four nurses. Other program costs include thesalary for a part-time program coordinator, training,rent, computers, and medical supplies. Total cost forthe first year of the program in Oakland was approxi-mately $400,000 (100 mothers) and about $350,000in the second year. The program costs approximately$3,200 per family per year during the start-up phaseand $2,800 per family per year after the nurses havebeen trained and are working to full capacity. Program Results: Studies have demonstrated that the program reduces neurological impairment inchildren by helping mothers improve their diet andreduce alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, and alsominimizes childhood abuse and neglect. A 15 yearfollow-up study of the program in Elmira, New York,by researchers from the University of Colorado,Cornell University, the University of Rochester, andthe University of Denver compared participatingmothers and infants with a control group receivingbasic prenatal care. Mothers were randomly assignedto either the program or control group. The evalua-tion found that program participants had: n79 percent fewer reported cases of child abuseand neglect; nfewer subsequent children (1.1 versus 1.6); nlonger intervals between the births of theirfirst and second children (67 months versus37 months); n30 fewer months on welfare (60 months versus90 months); n44 percent fewer alcohol and other drug-related behavioral problems and 69 percentfewer arrests among mothers; and n56 percent fewer arrests and days of alcoholconsumption among the 15 year old children. Furthermore, the evaluation data showed that, given the fewer number of subsequent pregnanciesand reduced dependence on government welfare pro-grams, the costs of the program were recovered infour years. A report from the RAND Corporation estimated that by the time the children reached theage of 15, the cost savings were four times greaterthan the original investment when reductions in wel-fare expenditures, crime, and health care costs are tak-en into account. The Oakland program has produced some impres- sive changes among women in the program. Althoughit is too early for site-specific evaluation data, programstaff say that there have been no reported incidents ofchild abuse, many women have reduced tobacco use,few premature babies were born, and approximately 95percent of the women have received their GED, jobtraining, or have entered college. Residential Student Assistance Program, Westchester County, New York Program Type: Targeting High-risk Groups. Target Audience: Adolescents in the juvenile justice system.Years in Operation: 1988-present. Program Goals: Delay the onset and reduce the use of alcohol and other drugs and improve youths' self-esteem and communication skills.Contact Information: Ellen Morehouse, Student Assistance 914-332-1300, sascorp@aol.com. Description: The Residential Student Assistance Program (RSAP) is a substance abuse prevention/intervention program serving adolescents in the juve-nile justice system in Westchester County, New York.Started in 1988 with a five-year demonstration grantfrom the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, theprogram is based on successful Employee AssistancePrograms (EAPs) used by business and industry toidentify and aid employees affected by substanceabuse. Goals of the program are to delay the onset of,or reduce, alcohol and other drug use; develop peerresistance skills; improve self-image and sense of self-worth; and enhance communication and interperson-al skills. In 1999, RSAP was selected as a nationalhigh-risk youth replication model by the Center forSubstance Abuse Prevention. RSAP targets youths between the ages of 14 and 17, most of whom are African American or Hispanic.The program is implemented in six WestchesterCounty locations: a locked county correctional An OJP Issues & Practices Report 13residential facilities where the program was being implemented. RSAP encouraged facilities to imple-ment EAPs for their staff members, offered staff train-ing at all levels, and formed a staff task forcerepresenting personnel from clinical to maintenancestaff. Working program activities into the adolescents' already busy schedules presented difficulties. As aresult, the staff decided to present the program in theschool setting, where most prevention programs aretraditionally offered. Staff had to help school person-nel understand that while the program might requirechildren to miss a class or two, the benefits would sig-nificantly improve their schooling. Realizing that theirstudents would learn more if they were not usingdrugs or distracted by family issues, most teachersacknowledged RSAP's importance. Costs and Funding Sources: The RSAP program in Westchester County was initially funded by a five-year demonstration grant from the Center forSubstance Abuse Prevention. When federal funds ranout, all six of the facilities where the program wasbeing implemented picked up the costs of the pro-gram. The program budget consists only of the salaryof the full-time or part-time student assistance coun-selor working in the facility and some supervision bythe agency implementing the program. For communi-ties looking to replicate the program, expenses wouldinclude hiring on-site counselors, staff supervision,and training. RSAP offers a training $375, and on-site training costs range from$500 to $1,000 per day, depending on the location.T raining fees include the implementation manual,which can also be purchased separately for $125. A$20 informational video is also available. Program Results: An independent evaluation of RSAP conducted by Dobler Research Associates ofSand Lake, New York, showed promising results. Theevaluation, which compared 125 adolescents whotook part in the program with 201 youths who didnot, yielded the following information: n82 percent of youth who did not drink, 83percent who did not use marijuana, and 78percent who did not smoke before enteringthe program remained nonusers; n72 percent of youth who drank, 59 percentwho used marijuana, and 27 percent whofacility; a nonsecure residential facility for juvenile offenders; a facility for adolescents with severe psychi-atric problems; and three foster care facilities forabused, neglected, orphaned, and troubled youths.Highly trained Student Assistance Counselors (SACs)work with youths in the facilities. The SACs assess allnew residents for substance abuse and provide drugusers and children of drug users with individual andgroup counseling. The SACs also implement small(6-8 residents) discussion groups in which adolescentstalk about their own substance abuse or that of a fam-ily member, other family problems, and stress. Thediscussion groups help the youths and counselors getacquainted and begin changing the participants' atti-tudes about alcohol and other drugs. The facility alsohosts 12-Step meetings, and residents are referred fortreatment outside the residential facility when neces-sary. The SACs assist residents in developing anAdolescent Resident Task Force which meets regularlyand works to increase self-referral for prevention andtreatment activities. The Student Assistance Counselors also work with the staff of the residential facilities. They coordi-nate a Residential Facility Staff Task Force whichincludes employees of the youth residential facility.The group meets weekly to discuss policy and pro-gram issues that affect prevention. SACs train residen-tial staff to implement drug prevention strategies, andan EAP is available to help those experiencing person-al problems. The Westchester County programemploys five full-time counselors (four work full-timein individual facilities and one splits time betweentwo facilities) and one supervisor. Together, they serveapproximately 600 adolescents per year. RSAP is currently being replicated in Mass- achusetts, and similar programs in Alaska, Arizona,Connecticut, and Florida are in the planning stages ofimplementation. Challenges: One of the major obstacles to imple- menting RSAP was recruiting, hiring, and retainingproject staff qualified to work with program partici-pants. Initially, staff were hired based solely on theirexperience in working with adolescents, but programdevelopers soon learned staff also needed to be trainedand experienced in substance abuse prevention to besuccessful. Changing the qualifications of the counsel-ing staff helped ensure success. Another obstacle wasbuilding support among all staff working in the Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 14 An OJP Issues & Practices Report14 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportby the time children are in eighth grade, more than 50 percent of them have tried alcohol, 44 percenthave tried cigarettes, 22 percent have tried marijuana,and 20 percent have tried inhalants. 26Family-centered approaches train and support families who are tryingto keep their children free from alcohol and otherdrugs. Family programs employ a variety of tools, including homework assignments, brochures, home study guides, workshops, and audio and video-cassettes. Recent research suggests that the most effec-tive programs promote positive relationships betweenparents and children. 27They provide training in com- munication, especially as young people move intoadolescence, and they work to reduce conflict, whichcan damage bonds between parents and children. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends that family-based prevention programsincorporate the following principles 28: nReach families of children at each stage ofdevelopment; nT rain parents in behavioral skills to reduceconduct problems in children, improve parent-child relationships, provide consistent disci-pline and rulemaking, and monitor children'sactivities during adolescence; nInclude an educational component for parentswith drug information for them and their children; nDirect services to families with children inkindergarten through 12th grade to enhanceprotective factors; and nProvide access to counseling services to fami-lies at risk. Family-based programs serve families based on the child's stage of development, ranging from birthto young adulthood. The federal Center for SubstanceAbuse Prevention recommends three family-centeredapproaches that show great potential. The first, parentand family skills training, teaches parents how tobuild protective factors and reduce risk factors linkedto substance abuse. These risk factors include com-munication problems, too lax or too stringent disci-pline, parental substance use, and child abuse orneglect. Family protective factors include close-knitsmoked before entering the program reported discontinued use at post-test; npast month alcohol use fell 46 percent (versusa 2 percent drop among the control group); nmarijuana use dropped 45 percent (versus a 12percent increase in the control group); and ntobacco use fell 16 percent (versus an 8 per-cent increase in the control group). A major accomplishment of RSAP is that it achieved such significant prevention results with ado-lescents who are considered at highest risk because ofmultiple risk factors. The combination of a soundtheoretical basis for the program and quality staffhelped ensure success. While program staff believe ininvolving parents in prevention, the target audiencefor the program did not have the parental resourcesavailable to most children. For young people withoutparental support, RSAP proved effective preventioncan be achieved. IV. Building Family Bonds Parents are powerful influences in the lives of their children. Through words and actions theycan provide key guidance on alcohol, tobacco, andother drug use. Parents have a critical role to play inprevention\u2014not only within the family, but also incollaboration with schools and community groups.Research shows that the more often parents talk withtheir children about the dangers of alcohol and otherdrugs, the less likely it is that their children willexperiment with them. 25Increasingly, prevention programs are being designed to enhance parent-childcommunication and improve other family skills.Parental disapproval of delinquency and drug use cancounteract the peer pressure youngsters experience toengage in these activities. Substance abuse prevention programs have tradi- tionally been part of school and community efforts,but a new trend is toward family-based preventionprograms. School and community programs, whileessential, are not sufficient because many schools donot begin to address the problem of substance abuseuntil adolescence; substance abuse often begins earlier.According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future study, An OJP Issues & Practices Report 15Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 15Preventing substance abuse by building family bonds is a growing trend among the nation's commu-nities; the following programs are noteworthy exam-ples of the different approaches. Dare to be You, Ute Indian Reservation, Colorado Program Type: Building Family Bonds. Target Audience: Preschoolers and their families. Years in Operation: 1989-present. Program Goals: Improve communication between par- ents and their children and train teachers and com-munity members to provide services to target families.Contact Information: Jan Miller-Heyl, Colorado State University, 970-565-3606. Description: Dare to be You is a substance abuse prevention program for families with preschoolers.Developed by researchers at the University ofColorado, the program was inspired by the need forfamily-based prevention efforts on the Ute reserva-tion, which was experiencing high rates of substanceabuse, unemployment, and teenage pregnancy. Theprogram began in 1989, has served approximately180 families (the entire population of the reservationis 1,400), and remains popular among residents. There are three components of the Dare to be You program. The family component provides train-ing in communication, parenting skills, and socialskills for children and parents. The school componenttrains and supports child care providers and teachers,and the community component trains communitymembers who will provide ongoing support to thetarget children and their families. Goals of the pro-gram include improving parents' sense of competence,helping parents understand appropriate child manage-ment strategies, improving children's and parents'relationships with their peers, and boosting children'sdevelopmental levels. Parents are given incentives tocomplete the program: they receive a free meal eachsession, child care is provided, and each familyreceives $200 at the end of the program. The Ute program is run through the reservation's Head Start program, and classes are held in the HeadStart building. Sessions run concurrently, so whileparents are learning skills in one room, their childrenare receiving developmentally appropriate informationfamilial relationships, consistent discipline, and parental supervision of children's daily activities.These programs can improve poor parent-child com-munication, child behavior, and parenting skills, andreduce family conflict. Such interventions are directedat families with children who have no apparent riskfactors for substance abuse as well as those at moder-ate and high risk. 29 Programming differs depending on the target population. For example, Preparing for the Drug FreeYears is a program that aims to improve parents'child-rearing techniques, parent-child bonding, andchildren's peer resistance skills in five weekly sessions,four of which are parent-only. T reatment Foster Care,however, trains foster families to care for teenagerswith histories of chronic, severe criminal behavior.Both programs have been found to reduce drug useamong participants. The second approach, family in-home support, provides crisis intervention (such as food, shelter,clothing) and long-range training that addresses theroot causes of the crisis. These programs aim todecrease domestic violence, child abuse and neglect,and child placement in foster care, and are most effec-tive with high-risk children. In-home services can alsoreduce youth crime rates by helping youngstersimprove their social skills, anger management, schoolattendance, and attitudes toward authority. 30 Family therapy, the third approach, helps family members improve the way they communicate, man-age family life, and solve problems. Programs areaimed at families with children at high risk and aredesigned to improve family functioning and reduceantisocial behavior among both parents and children.Family therapy is often integrated with other preven-tion efforts, such as in-home support and school-based counseling. 31 Media campaigns aimed at educating youths and their parents about the dangers of substance abuse arealso used to develop family prevention skills. TheOffice of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)launched the National Youth Anti-Drug MediaCampaign in 1998, which aims to teach youths aboutdrugs, educate parents about the dangers of drugs,and encourage adults to communicate with their chil-dren. Anti-drug advertisements will run through2002.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 16 An OJP Issues & Practices Report16 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportParents in the experimental group reported mul- tiple positive benefits which reduce substance abuserisk factors for their children: nincreased satisfaction with their parenting role(15.5 percent more than control group); nincreased sense of personal worth (13.5 per-cent more than control families); na more positive relationship with their children(6.5 percent more than control families); and na 13.7 percent decrease in the use of harshpunishment to discipline their children (use ofharsh punishment decreased less than one per-cent among control families). Children in the program experienced a 6 percent increase in their developmental level compared totheir peers in the control group. Dare to be You has had a positive impact on the Ute reservation and is now a household name in thecommunity. One of the major accomplishments ofthe program is that it has been institutionalized in thecommunity; all Head Start teachers on the reservationare now trained Dare to be You providers, and theyreinforce the themes of the program to preschoolerson a daily basis. Moreover, teen workers who assistwith the program have become role models in theircommunity. Functional Family Therapy, Las Vegas, Nevada Program Type: Building Family Bonds. Target Audience: Youths ages 11-18 in the juvenile jus- tice system and their families.Years in Operation: 1996-present. Program Goals: Change negative family behavior pat- terns and assist families in accessing communityresources.Contact Information: Kathie Shafer, Project Coordinator, University of Utah, 801-585-1807. Description: Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is a prevention/intervention program for at-risk chil-dren (ages 11-18) and their families. The programin the same building. Teenagers from the community (sometimes older siblings of preschoolers in the pro-gram) are trained and paid to be helpers. Some of thechildren who entered the program as preschoolershave returned as teen workers. There is a strongemphasis on hiring multicultural teen workers, sinceUte youths typically have poor relationships withyouths outside their community. Dare to be You was selected as an Exemplary Prevention Program by the National Association ofState Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, chosen as aHigh Risk Youth replication model by the Center forSubstance Abuse Prevention, and is a winner of theColorado Governor's Award for Excellence inSubstance Abuse Prevention. Challenges: The major obstacle to implementing Dare to be You on the Ute reservation was securingadequate meeting space. Head Start has donated useof its classrooms; however, it continues to be logisti-cally difficult to share work space. Dare to be You canbe implemented through any community organiza-tion in contact with the target audience. Costs and Funding Sources: The estimated cost of putting 25-30 families through the program is$25,000. This amount varies depending on the localcost of living. Program expenses include staffing(including teen worker salaries), parent incentivemoney, rent (if necessary), and supplies. T raining costsapproximately $3,000 for 35 people; everyoneinvolved in the program, including teen workers andagency supervisors, receives the training. The Ute pro-gram was originally funded as a demonstration proj-ect by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.Current funding to support the program's $11,000annual budget is provided by a local foundation. Program Results: Researchers at the University of Colorado evaluated the program at four sites inColorado; Montezuma County, Colorado Springs,San Luis Valley, and the Ute reservation. The programwas implemented in community centers, day care,and Head Start facilities, and included Hispanic,African-American, and White parents and their pre-school children. The evaluation involved 780 parents,498 in the intervention group and 282 in the controlgroup.Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 17An OJP Issues & Practices Report 17In addition to the Las Vegas site, FFT is being implemented in 25 locations nationwide. One majorinnovation is that all sites enter individual case datainto a national network called the Clinical ServicesSystem that enables researchers to monitor and com-pare data. Challenges: One of the challenges program providers faced in Las Vegas was creating a partner-ship with the juvenile justice system. The goal was toformally integrate FFT into the system in order tocreate a continuum of care for juveniles and theirfamilies. Program developers dedicated a great deal oftime to developing effective communication with jus-tice personnel. Probation officers were taught to makeappropriate referrals to the program and to respect theconfidentiality of therapy. A potential obstacle for communities looking to implement FFT is the year-long training process,which includes basic training, on-going supervision,and use of the Clinical Services System. Programdevelopers insist on strict adherence to the programmodel. Costs and Funding Sources: In Las Vegas the cost of serving one family ranges from $500 to$1,300. The year-long process of training and super-vision required to become an FFT-certified site costs$20,500. A community can expect to pay, on average,$2,000 per family served. Program Results: Thirteen evaluations of Functional Family Therapy have been conducted overthe past 30 years, including studies by the Universityof Utah and the University of Nevada. The studiesindicate that FFT can reduce criminal recidivismamong high-risk youths between 25 and 60 percent.A cost-effectiveness study of the program estimatedthat spending $2,000 on one family resulted in$14,000 in cost savings by: nDeterring adolescents from moving into high-er cost treatment services; nPreventing younger children in the familiesfrom entering the system of care; nPreventing juveniles from entering the adultcriminal system; and nAvoiding future crime victim costs.mainly targets youths in the juvenile justice system, aiming to reduce delinquency and substance use. Thefamily focus of the program has evolved from thehypothesis that the family setting is the entry point toaddressing problem behavior among adolescents. FFThas been identified as a Model Program in Blueprints for Violence Prevention by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at the University ofColorado. In Las Vegas, the fastest growing city in the country, FFT is the sole source of counseling servicesfor all youths in the juvenile justice system. The pro-gram is provided by the Family Project\u2014a collabora-tive effort between the University of Nevada, LasVegas (UNLV) and the Clark County Family andYouth Services Division. The juveniles entering thesystem range from relatively low-risk children toyouths with multiple antisocial behaviors and relatedsyndromes. To address the diverse needs of these chil-dren and their families, FFT is designed as a phasedprogram, with modules that complement one anoth-er. Each phase has special intervention and assessmentactivities aimed at accomplishing specific goals ofindividual families. The phases include: nEngage and motivate youths and their familiesby decreasing the intense negativity so oftencharacteristic of these families; nReduce and eliminate problem behaviors andpatterns by improving family communicationand parenting and problem-solving skills; and nGeneralize changes across problem situationsby increasing the families' knowledge of andability to avail themselves of communityresources. In Las Vegas, four full-time counselors, two from UNLV and two provided by the county, work withfamilies. FFT is a short-term intervention that, onaverage, conducts eight to 12 one-hour sessions formild cases and up to 26-30 hours of direct service formore intensive cases. Often, counselors handle 15 cas-es at a time, and cases average three months in length.Upon completion, participants are assessed at one-month, six-month, and one-year follow-ups. In thelast two years, 480 families have been referred to theLas Vegas program.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 18 An OJP Issues & Practices Report18 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportSince siblings of the adolescents being served in Nevada generally experience lower arrest rates andminimal contact with the juvenile justice system, itappears that FFT creates systemic change within thefamilies it serves. Another study found that counselorswere able to get 86 percent of referred families into atleast two program sessions, indicating that FFTproviders are successfully engaging families. Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14, Pella, Iowa Program Type: Building Family Bonds. Target Audience: Youths ages 10-14 and their parents. Years in Operation: 1992-present. Program Goals: Prevent teen substance abuse by increasing family bonds.Contact Information: Sherry Maakestad, Crossroads of Pella, Molgaard, Ph.D., for Social andBehavioral Research, Iowa State University, 515-294-4518. Description: Youths and families in more than 80 Iowa communities participate in the StrengtheningFamilies Program: For Parents and Youth 10-14 (SFP10-14), a parent, youth, and family skills-buildingcurriculum designed to prevent teen substance abuseand other problem behaviors, strengthen parentingskills, and build family strengths. Developed in 1992by the Institute for Social and Behavioral Research atIowa State University, the program is based on theStrengthening Families Program developed at theUniversity of Utah. For the past six years, Crossroads, a private social service agency in Pella, Iowa (population 15,000), hasrun two SFP 10-14 programs annually for fifth toeighth graders and their parents, one in the local pub-lic school and one in a private school. The programstypically average 15 families annually in seven two-hour weekly sessions. In addition, four two-hourbooster sessions are provided between three and 12months following conclusion of the original sessions.During the sessions, parents and youths meet separate-ly for the first hour, and then during the second hourpractice what they have learned together. The sevenparent-oriented sessions focus on making house rules,encouraging good behavior, employing discipline,building bridges, protecting against substance abuse, and using community resources. The child-orientedsessions focus on building personal goals, appreciatingparents, dealing with stress, handling peer pressure,and reaching out to others. Family sessions involvesupporting and attaining goals, appreciating familymembers, understanding family values, and buildingfamily communication. The booster sessions generallyinclude handling stress and conflict, and improvingfamily communication. In addition to schools, other possible venues for SFP 10-14 include religious facilities and communitycenters. While the program can involve 12 families atonce, group size should be reduced in special situa-tions, such as court-ordered treatment. Three groupleaders are required to implement the program: oneto lead the parent session, and two to lead youth ses-sions. All three leaders facilitate the family sessions. Over 600 SFP 10-14 facilitators have been trained in Iowa, and programming has reached morethan 1,000 families in the state, including those ininner-city settings. Increasingly, the program isexpanding outside of Iowa, and is currently beingreplicated in nearly 40 states. SFP 10-14 has beenidentified as a Promising Program by the Center forthe Study and Prevention of Violence at theUniversity of Colorado and as a Model FamilyProgram for Delinquency Prevention by the Officeof Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Challenges: A major obstacle to program success is recruiting and retaining families. Schools, socialservices agencies, and other community agencies arerelied upon to recruit families by hosting informa-tional meetings for parent leaders who in turn alsoassist in recruitment. Advertisements promote theprogram as help for parents during the teen years, asopposed to a support program for at-risk families. InPella the program offers on-site child care to helpretain families. SFP 10-14 program sites have demon-strated a 94 percent retention rate of families whoattend the first meeting. Costs and Funding Sources: To replicate SFP 10-14, curricula for the 11 sessions including a one-day training session, plus manuals and videotapes,costs $535. The manuals contain instructions for 33hours of activities, such as learning games, discus-sions, skill-building activities, and family projects. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 19Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 19T raining consists of a lesson on program background and research results, discussion of techniques andteaching philosophy, an overview of program logisticsand recruitment, and hands-on practice of selectedactivities. Agencies at various sites have implementedthe program without hiring new staff, keeping costs ata minimum. The two programs in Pella cost about $4,500 annually. Child care is provided on-site, and Crossroadsconducts publicity campaigns to recruit families. Program Results: Evaluation studies of SFP 10-14 conducted by the Institute for Social andBehavioral Research at Iowa State University havefound lowered alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana useamong participating youngsters when compared withsimilar children in a control group. Four years follow-ing baseline assessment: n31 percent of program youths had ever beendrunk, compared to 46.5 percent of the con-trol group; n13 percent of program youths had smoked cig-arettes in the past month, compared to 24.5percent of the control group; and n8.3 percent of program youths had used mari-juana, compared to 17.6 percent of the controlgroup. T wo major accomplishments of the Pella pro- gram are successfully involving parents in preventionactivities, often a difficult task, and forming a part-nership with the schools, facilitating recruiting andpublicity. V. Empowering Communities Communities can find solutions to many of their own problems. Community-led initiatives addressingthe problems of substance abuse and related crimehave proliferated throughout the last decade.Community coalitions aimed at underage drinking,Weed and Seed initiatives, and other programs havesprung up in cities and towns nationwide, supportedby foundations, individual donors, and the federalgovernment.A community coalition is comprised of commu- nity stakeholders\u2014service providers, residents, com-munity and business leaders, educators, government officials, law enforcement officers, and others\u2014whocombine human and financial resources to address aparticular issue or set of issues within the community.The emergence of crack cocaine in the 1980s prompt-ed many communities to form anti-drug coalitions, anumber of which still exist today. Coalitions, bymobilizing the community, have helped to changepublic policy and have empowered residents by givingthem a sense of ownership and investment. The federal government and private foundations recognize the value of building community coalitionsto address substance abuse and have spent hundredsof millions of dollars to support these efforts. TheRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, for example, cre-ated Fighting Back coalitions to help communitiesreduce the demand for alcohol and other drugs. TheCenter for Substance Abuse Prevention has spent over$300 million on its Community Partnership pro-gram, which has supported nearly 500 coalitionsnationwide. The Drug-Free Communities Act, signedinto law in June 1997, provides financial support andtechnical assistance to community coalitions seekingto reduce adolescent substance abuse. The Office ofJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention managesthe Drug-Free Communities Support Program, whichprovides annual grants of up to $100,000 to commu-nity coalitions for youth substance abuse preventionefforts. Funding for the program, which was $10 mil-lion in FY 1998, has increased annually and will be$43.5 million in FY 2002. There are currently 213grantees from 45 states and the U.S. Virgin Islandsand Puerto Rico. While most coalitions are established for the same purpose\u2014bringing the community together toaddress substance abuse\u2014the structure and activitiesof coalitions can differ markedly, making it difficultto offer one blueprint of how coalitions work.However, studies conducted in 1999 by the Centerfor Substance Abuse Prevention and the CommunityAnti-Drug Coalitions of America identified some keyelements the community's needs andresources; nWidely shared and comprehensive vision;Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 20 An OJP Issues & Practices Report20 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportA community-oriented policing component connects weeding and seeding efforts. An important feature ofWeed and Seed is that each site must form a localsteering committee, made up of all key communitystakeholders and chaired by the U.S. Attorney for thatdistrict. The committee is then responsible for estab-lishing goals and objectives, developing programs,providing guidance, and assessing achievement. The inclusion of local residents, services, and institutions contributes to community ownership ofprograms, which is important for finding local fund-ing. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, for example, funding forthe anti-drug coalition comes from money collectedfrom individuals arrested for driving under the influ-ence or some other drug offense. In Kansas City,Missouri, residents approved a 0.25 percent increasein the sales tax to support community anti-drugefforts. Nonprofit community organizations also offerwin-win partnerships with local business and indus-tries looking to support a good cause and garner localpublicity. Evaluation of community coalitions is providing data about what makes coalitions successful. The fol-lowing programs exemplify how communities cancombine grassroots efforts with research-based theo-ries of intervention to address illicit drug and alcoholproblems. Midwestern Prevention Project, Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana Program Type: Empowering Communities. Target Audience: Pre-middle school youths, and communities.Years in Operation: 1987-present. Program Goals: To reduce youth drug use by coordi- nating anti-drug efforts among schools, parents, andcommunities.Contact Information: Karen Bernstein, University of Southern California, 323-865-0325. Description: The Midwestern Prevention Project (MPP) delivers anti-drug messages to youths throughschools, parents, and communities. The program aimsto reduce drug supply and demand by combiningprevention activities with policy changes. The pro-gram began in 1984 and is now being used in fivestates. The Midwestern Prevention Project was namednClear and focused strategic plan; nDiverse membership (including key commu-nity leaders, local government officials, andvolunteers); nStrong leadership and committed partners; nDiversified and relevant funding (coalitionsshould not accept funding that may compro-mise their mission); and nWell-managed structure (including organizedadministration, effective communicationamong members/volunteers/staff, and a com-prehensive evaluation plan). The growth of coalitions has also spurred the cre- ation of national organizations to support them. TheCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America andJoin Together are two major organizations that providetechnical assistance to new and existing coalitions. Some communities have developed coalitions focused specifically on curbing youth alcohol use.These coalitions have demonstrated an impact byeffecting environmental changes that reduce youthaccess to alcohol, through legislation and publicawareness. For example, the Coalition to ReduceUnderage Drinking in North Carolina helped passlegislation that sets penalties for adults who supplyalcohol to minors and limits the amount of revenuethat stores in certain low-income neighborhoods cangenerate from alcohol sales. In addition, the Coalitionworked with retailers to create a media campaigndesigned to change adult attitudes about youth drink-ing. Recognizing the devastating effects of underagedrinking on communities, the Office of JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention supports coali-tion efforts through its Combating UnderageDrinking Program. Another Department of Justice program, Weed and Seed, targets the relationship between substanceabuse and crime in America's cities. Weed and Seed isa community-based, multiagency initiative designedto control, reduce, and prevent violent crime anddrug abuse. Law enforcement agencies and prosecu-tors cooperate in \"weeding out\" criminals who partici-pate in violent crime and drug abuse to prevent theirreturn to the target area; \"seeding\" brings humanservices to the area, encompassing prevention, inter-vention, treatment, and neighborhood revitalization. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 21Prevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 2122 An OJP Issues & Practices Reporta Model Program in Blueprints for Violence Prevention by the Center for the Study and Prevention of Vio-lence at the University of Colorado. In 1987, theMPP was implemented in all 133 public schools inMarion County, Indiana. The MPP consists of five components: school program, mass media, parent program, communityorganization, and health policy. The program is intro-duced in sixth or seventh grade, before youths makethe transition into middle or junior high school. Theprogram is administered by teachers and student lead-ers elected by the class and trained by the teacher.During the first year there are between ten and 13classroom sessions discussing resistance skills, promot-ing a nondrug use environment, and creating an anti-drug climate in the school. The second year of theprogram provides five follow-up sessions which rein-force the skills learned in the previous year. Through-out high school, peer counseling and supportactivities are available. The mass media component begins the same year as the school component and continues for five years.Each year there are approximately 30 reports aboutthe program on television, radio, and in newspapers.The reports are designed to keep community mem-bers involved by keeping them informed of new pro-gram components and what students are learning inthe program. The parent component, taking place during years two and three, gets parents involved in supporting adrug-free environment in their homes and in middleschool. A group consisting of the principal, four to sixparents, and two students meets throughout theschool year to institutionalize drug prevention in theschool, monitors the school grounds to ensure a drug-free environment, and plans and implements parentskills training twice each year. Each of the schools inIndianapolis has a parent committee led by a parentinvolved in the Parent Teacher Association. During years three through five, community leaders are trained and form a community organiza-tion to implement drug abuse prevention services.These services complement what is being done in theschools and with the parents. During the fourth andfifth year, members of the community organizationform a health policy subcommittee to implementpolicy changes designed to reduce the supply of andthe demand for drugs. Policy changes might includeordinances restricting cigarette smoking in public areas or mandating drug-free zones. Indianapolis hashad eight committees, including a medical actioncommittee which produced a resources list of all localsubstance abuse treatment facilities serving youth.The list was distributed to area schools and hospitals.The government committee produced a brochuredetailing parents' legal responsibilities concerningyouth and alcohol, such as the possible repercussionsof allowing alcohol to be served at a graduation partyin the home. Over 150,000 of these brochures weredistributed to parents. Challenges: One of the challenges to implement- ing the MPP in Marion County was coordinatingprogram development among the key players, includ-ing teachers, the school superintendent, local officialsin law enforcement, and the business community. Inorder to address this problem, the Lilly Endowment,the project funder, required that all schools in the dis-trict commit to participating in the program beforeawarding the grant. Costs and Funding Sources: The program was funded by a $6 million grant from the Lilly Endow-ment. Additional funding was provided by theUniversity of Southern California for evaluation ofthe program. It costs approximately $175,000 over athree-year period for a school to implement the MPP ,which includes providing curriculum materials for1,000 students and training 20 teachers and 20 mem-bers of the parent group. Outcome Measures: The University of Southern California and the Kaufman Foundation are conduct-ing an ongoing evaluation of the MidwesternPrevention Project in Kansas City, Missouri, whichwas the first city to implement the program. Resultsfrom the evaluation show that the positive effects ofthe program endure over time. By the end of high school, the program youth showed the following net reductions* in drug use: n4.9 percent daily cigarette use; n7.2 percent monthly drunkenness; n2.9 percent marijuana use more than twice aweek. *Percent increase in control group minus percent increase in program group.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbusePrevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 23By early adulthood (age 23), program youths continued to show less drug use than the controlgroup: n1.9 percent less cigarette use; n1.5 percent less marijuana use more than twicea week; n6.2 percent less lifetime amphetamine use; and n8.1 percent less lifetime inhalant use. Project Northland, Ten Minnesota Communities Program Type: Empowering Communities. Target Audience: Youths, their parents, and communities. in Operation: First phase: 1991-1994; second phase: 1996-1999.Program Goals: To prevent underage drinking through community and family supported alcohol education.Contact Information: Project Northland curriculum materials, 800-328-9000; Project Northland is a communi- tywide intervention designed to reduce adolescentalcohol use. The program was developed at theUniversity of Minnesota and piloted in ten Minnesotacommunities to help prevent underage drinking. Theprogram is a multilevel program involving students,parents, businesses, and community residents andorganizations. The Minnesota program served 2,400students from 24 school districts, including schoolson seven Native American reservations with high ratesof death and disability from alcohol abuse. Each com-munity site had a part-time field coordinator to assistin implementation. Through Project Northland, community strate- gies, action-based curricula, and peer leadership activ-ities all encourage positive individual behavior andenvironmental change. The first phase of the inter-vention includes eight sessions each year for sixth,seventh, and eighth grade students that focus on therisks of drinking. These sessions are designed to pre-vent alcohol use through normative education, socialresistance skills training, and decision making. Eachof the middle-school years revolves around a specifictheme and incorporates individual, parent, and com- munity training. nsixth grade\u2014a strong family component tar-gets student and parent communication byrequiring parents and children to completehomework assignments together that describeadolescent alcohol use. Group discussions onfamily communication are held in schools.Also in the first year, a communitywide taskforce is created to address teen alcohol use. nseventh grade\u2014a student- and teacher-ledclassroom curriculum focuses on resistanceskills and normative expectations regardingteen alcohol use. Discussions, games, problem-solving, and role plays are all components ofthis curriculum. A peer participant programcreates alternative alcohol-free activities, andparents continue to be involved. The taskforce focuses on alcohol-related environmentalpolicies, and businesses get involved by provid-ing discounts for children who pledge to bealcohol- and drug-free. neighth grade\u2014students work on becomingactive citizens by interviewing communityleaders about adolescent drinking and conducttown meetings to make recommendations forthe community's help in preventing alcoholuse. The second phase, delivered during the students' last two years of high school, incorporates five majorcomponents to reduce alcohol availability and rein-force no-use norms: community organizing, parenteducation, youth participation, media campaigns, andschool curriculum. Program staff work with youth inmore sophisticated ways for example, developingcommunity action projects focused on teen alcoholissues, creating original videos that focus on alterna-tives to drinking, community response to teen drink-ing, and dramatizations of the negative consequencesof drinking; and learning about the state legislativeprocess. Challenges: One challenge in implementing the program is creating a community partnership thatembraces the program's goals. In Minnesota, staffused media messages to help create a partnershipwithin the community; articles in newspapers andschool newsletters helped publicize the program.24 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportMinnesota staff conducted a community leader survey to assess what changes the community would support.Another obstacle can be obtaining agreement fromthe schools to participate, particularly consideringpotential shifts in school leadership and administra-tion. A nonlegal binding agreement was used inMinnesota communities to keep schools on board. Costs and Funding Sources: The complete Project Northland curriculum for one school costs$549, plus $150 for each set of sixth grade workbooks(one set includes 30 workbooks; individual books canalso be purchased). T raining sessions (which last twoto three days) are held in various sites throughout thecountry and cost $1,500 per day. Additional costsinclude salaries for part-time program coordinators.Project Northland was developed, implemented, andevaluated in Minnesota through a five-year grantfrom the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism. Program Results: Project Northland successfully prevents youth substance abuse. While the primaryfocus of the program is on alcohol, it has impactedtobacco and marijuana use as well. A study comparingProject Northland youths with similar noninvolvedyoungsters found that participating youths were: n30 percent less likely to drink in the pastweek; n20 percent less likely to drink in the pastmonth; n20 percent less likely to smoke regularly; and n15 percent less likely to use marijuana. The second phase of the program was completed in 1999, and evaluation of its effectiveness in prevent-ing teen alcohol use is currently underway. The program has also indirectly contributed to the passage of five alcohol-related city ordinances,including the establishment of responsible beverageserver training, stricter requirements for the renewaland granting of liquor licenses, and limitations onliquor establishment operating hours. ProjectNorthland received an \"A\" in Making the Grade: A Guide to School Drug Prevention Programs and has been identified as a Promising Program by the Centerfor the Study and Prevention of Violence at theUniversity of Colorado.Troy Community Coalition for the Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse,Troy, Michigan Program Type: Empowering Communities. Target Audience: Youths, their families, and communities. Years in Operation: 1985-present. Program Goals: To reduce underage drinking by edu- cating youths, their parents, and the community.Contact Information: Mary Ann Solberg, Director, 248-740-0431. Description: The T roy Community Coalition formed when the town began to experience anincrease in youth alcohol abuse in the mid-1980s. Toaddress the problem, the school district created athree-pronged approach: implement a new health andpeer pressure resistance program, develop a parentgroup, and create a community program. This com-munity program developed into the T roy CommunityCoalition for the Prevention of Drug and AlcoholAbuse. After operating on a small budget for aboutone year, the coalition won a $1.3 million grant fromthe Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. The coalition follows a cradle-to-grave strategy, implementing programs for all sectors of the commu-nity ranging from pre-schoolers to senior citizens. Thecoalition works with schools, parent groups, thepolice department, the court system, and the citycommission, among others. For example, the coali-tion offers a parenting class to help parents talk withtheir children about alcohol, encourages the police tomake sure bars and store do not sell alcohol tominors, and successfully advocated legislation requir-ing alcohol to be safeguarded, because youths werestealing alcohol from grocery store shelves. In addi-tion, the coalition trains pediatricians to work withparents to help them understand the problems associ-ated with underage drinking. Through a decade of programming, the coalition has identified several key elements of success: nPublic officials are vital to the work ofcoalitions; nCoalition programs must match or exceedcommunity perceptions of quality;Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbusePrevention An OJP Issues & Practices Report 25nCreative methods must be used to recruit, retain, and recognize volunteers; and nCoalitions must be funded, at least in part,locally. Creative use of data and outcomesattracts this funding. Challenges: A major obstacle to the coalition's work in T roy is denial among residents that there arealcohol and other drug problems in the community.The coalition conducts public awareness campaigns toeducate the public and demonstrate existing prob-lems. Data collection is a vital activity for informingthe creation of programs. The coalition monitorsadult and school surveys, emergency room data,police data, etc., to make sure the community's needsare being addressed and met. For example, the coali-tion observed an increase in alcohol abuse amongnewly retired senior citizens and created a senior vol-unteer bureau to address this problem. Another challenge is maintaining vital relation- ships with partners in public and private sectorsdespite constantly changing leadership. Continuedpublic education is needed to explain the mission ofthe coalition, the problems in the community, andhow partnerships can help solve these problems. Thecoalition must constantly educate new leaders andvolunteers to maintain and enhance these linkages,which are vital to the success of the coalition. Forexample, the linkage with the police department alertsthe coalition to emerging drug problems so it candevelop appropriate programming. Costs and Funding Sources: The coalition oper- ates on a $300,000 annual budget, which includesfour full-time staff and one part-time employee, andreceives funding from the city government (it is alineitem in the annual city budget). The schooldistrict supplies office space and other services, while corporate donations, small foundation grants, individ-ual donors, and fundraisers make up the remainingbudget. T roy staff believe that all fundraisers, in addi-tion to collecting money, should send significant pre-vention messages as well. For example, an annualcelebrity dinner sponsored by local corporations andattended by adults and children is alcohol-free. Program Results: The coalition's efforts to reduce teenage drinking resulted in significant reduc-tions between 1991 and 1998: n12th-grade students who reported consumingalcohol in the past month decreased from 62.1percent to 53.3 percent; and neighth-grade students who reported consum-ing alcohol during the past month decreasedfrom 26.3 percent to 17.4 percent. In addition, the coalition has been successful in changing community norms. For example, when theNational Football League wanted to host a youthcompetition in T roy sponsored by Budweiser, thecounty commission (which works closely with thecommunity coalition) declined the offer unless a newsponsor was found. The next year, the NFL resubmit-ted a proposal with a new sponsor. Another coalitionaccomplishment is receiving significant communityfunding. Since its inception, the coalition has workedto establish win-win relationships with businesses andorganizations who in turn support the coalition. Forexample, the coalition assisted one of its corporatesponsors in the development of an anti-drunk drivingpromotion. The coalition's work has also promptedvarious public policy changes that have strengthenedthe community's resistance to alcohol and other drugabuse. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 27Treatment Substance abuse treatment is the most cost-effective way to reduce addiction, improve the health of drug abusers, and relieve the growing burden of drug-relatedhealth care costs. With treatment, addicts can get off drugs, get jobs, and becomeproductive members of society. Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is similar toother chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, in that successful treatmentrequires permanent behavior change. As with all chronic illnesses, relapse is a possibil-ity, and failure to comply with treatment weakens the chances for successful recovery. An untreated addict can cost society an estimated $43,200 annually, compared with an average $16,000 for a year of residential care or $1,500 for an outpatientprogram. 34A 1994 California study (CALDATA) found that $1 invested in alcohol and other drug treatment saved taxpayers $7 in future costs.35The federal govern- ment's 1997 National T reatment Improvement Evaluation Study evaluated the effec-tiveness of treatment services for 5,000 clients in publicly funded programs. T reatingthese low-income clients saved society an average of $9,000 per client, compared to$3,000 spent on treatment. The study found a 3 to 1 ratio of benefits to costs. 36 Services offered by substance abuse treatment programs vary, as do the modali- ties, staff, and target populations. The four most common types of substance abusetreatment are 37: nOutpatient methadone programs \u2014provide methadone to reduce cravings for heroin. Counseling, vocational training, and case management are often usedto stabilize patient functioning; nLong-term residential programs \u2014offer drug-free treatment in a residential com- munity of counselors and recovering addicts. Patients generally stay in theprograms a year or more; nShort-term inpatient programs \u2014keep patients up to 30 days. Most of these programs focus on medical stabilization, abstinence, and lifestyle changes.Staff are primarily medical professionals and trained counselors; and nOutpatient drug-free programs \u2014use a wide range of approaches, including problem-solving groups, specialized therapies, cognitive-behavioral therapy,and 12-step programs. Studies of successful drug treatment programs have identified certain elements that enhance effectiveness. Length of time in treatment, intensity of treatment, andaftercare are key factors in helping addicts stay clean. According to extensive nationalstudies of tens of thousands of addicts, one-third of those who stay in treatmentlonger than three months are still drug-free one year later. The recovery rate jumps totwo-thirds when treatment lasts a year or longer. 38 The National Institute on Drug Abuse has identified 13 principles of effective treatment that are described in Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research- Based Guide (1999). These principles are as follows:28 An OJP Issues & Practices Report28 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportnNo single treatment is appropriate for all individuals; nT reatment needs to be readily available; nEffective treatment attends to multiple needsof the individual (such as medical, psychologi-cal, social, vocational, and legal problems); nT reatment and services plans must be assessedcontinually and modified as necessary toensure that the plan meets the individual'schanging needs; nRemaining in treatment for an adequate periodof time is critical for treatment effectiveness; nCounseling (individual and/or group) andother behavioral therapies are critical compo-nents of effective treatment; nMedications are an important element oftreatment for many patients, especially whencombined with counseling and other behav-ioral therapies; nAddicted or drug-abusing individuals withcoexisting mental disorders should have bothdisorders treated in an integrated way; nMedical detoxification is merely the first stageof addiction treatment and by itself does littleto change long-term drug use; nT reatment does not need to be voluntary to beeffective; nPossible drug use during treatment must bemonitored continuously; nT reatment programs should provide assess-ments for HIV/AIDS and other infectious dis-eases, and counseling to help patients modifyor change behaviors that place them or othersat risk of infection; and nRecovery from drug addiction is a long-termprocess and frequently requires multipleepisodes of treatment. Although treatment has proven effective, programs are still scarce. The National Academy of Sciences'Institute of Medicine estimates that programs are avail-able for only one quarter of the almost six millionpeople needing treatment. 39The federal government estimates that the need for substance abuse treatmentin the United States will grow 57 percent over the next 20 years.40The shift to managed health care among both public and privately funded treatment providershas reduced the availability of long-term substanceabuse treatment. Instead, coverage is provided only forshort-term interventions. Failure to provide adequate,appropriate treatment services reduces success rates andcontributes to public skepticism about investing intreatment programs. This chapter discusses various promising treat- ment approaches involving families, communities,and the criminal justice system. Effective strategiesinclude treating parents with their children, rehabili-tating criminal offenders, addressing the unique needsof adolescents, and connecting with the communityto serve hard-to-reach clients. The programs describedbelow may serve as examples to other communitiestrying to develop strategies to meet their own needs. I. Family-Based Treatment T reatment for a parent means prevention for a child. Children whose parents receive substance abusetreatment have lower health care costs than childrenof parents who do not receive treatment. 41In addi- tion, children of untreated addicts are at significant-ly higher risk of abusing substances themselves.Providing treatment services to addicts and theirchildren helps break the inter-generational cycle ofsubstance abuse. However, treatment has historicallybeen largely inaccessible to pregnant addicts and par-ents without access to transportation, child care, andaffordable services. Pregnant addicts have a particularly difficult time getting treatment, in large part because most treat-ment models were originally designed for maleaddicts. The 1997 Uniform Facility Data Set foundthat only 20 percent of treatment facilities surveyedoffered programs for pregnant or postpartum women;7.2 percent provided prenatal care, 4.8 percentoffered perinatal care, and 10.2 percent offeredchild care. 42Lack of specialized treatment options translates into greatly increased health and socialcosts. According to a 1995 study in Washington state,Medicaid expenses during the first two years of lifefor an infant born to an untreated substance-abusingwoman were 1.4 times higher than those incurred forPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseT reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 29infants born to treated substance-abusing women.43 The difference in dollar terms amounted to $1,800 per infant. Other deterrents for pregnant addicts are the risks of prosecution and of losing their children. Anincreasing number of states are prosecuting womenunder criminal laws for using drugs during pregnancy.For example, several women have been jailed underSouth Carolina's child-endangerment law, which tar-gets women who use illegal drugs while pregnant. TheU.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the state's right toprosecute these women in 1998, is now consideringwhether a South Carolina public hospital is violatingpregnant women's constitutional rights by testingthem for crack cocaine use. Public clinics are generallyrequired to report a pregnant woman to child welfareagencies if her urine tests are drug-positive. 44As a result, many pregnant drug users regard prenatal careas a potential legal trap and choose to forgo it. Recentstudies show that prenatal care substantially improvesa baby's health, even if the mother continues to usedrugs during pregnancy. 45 Women account for almost one-third of the total number of substance abusers in treatment.46The Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration's 1998 Services Research OutcomesStudy, which surveyed several thousand addicts fiveyears after their discharge from treatment, found thatwomen responded better to treatment than men.Women reported almost twice as great a reduction inillicit drug use after treatment than men did. 47The 1997 National T reatment Improvement EvaluationStudy also found that women addicts showed markedimprovement in the year following treatment. 48 Among women in the treated group, arrests declinedby two-thirds, while drug use dropped by almosthalf. 49 Certain aspects of women's lives are particularly important in addressing their treatment needs.Children are a central reality in the lives of mostwomen. Unless programs provide help with children,women often cannot participate. Several treatmentoutcome studies have found that women who havetheir children with them during residential treatmentare less likely to drop out and are more successful aftertreatment than women whose children are not withthem during treatment. 50,51,52Moreover, having chil- dren accompany mothers in both nonresidential andresidential treatment provides an opportunity to teach women parenting skills in a safe therapeutic setting. Sexual abuse, domestic violence, and depression are widespread among women addicts; these problemsmust be addressed in order to prevent relapse. Re-search indicates that women-only programs tend tobe more effective than coed, primarily becausewomen feel more comfortable talking to other womenabout their experiences. 53Programs should offer access to comprehensive services, such as family planning,physical and mental health care, job training, parent-ing, and family building skills. This model departsfrom traditional drug treatment, which concentratesalmost exclusively on addressing addictive behaviorrather than the constellation of other problems thatoften contribute to addiction in women. Despite the challenges, new treatment programs for pregnant, postpartum, and parenting substanceabusers have begun to target high-risk families, pro-viding treatment as well as parent training and jobreadiness skills. An emerging trend is to combine pre-natal care with drug treatment to protect unbornbabies from exposure to drugs and to prepare preg-nant women for parenthood. The Center forAddiction and Pregnancy in Baltimore found thatinfants of untreated women were more than twice aslikely (26 percent) to require neonatal intensive careunit (NICU) hospitalization than infants of treatmentpatients (10 percent). Taxpayers save nearly $5,000per child in NICU costs. 54 Families in crisis often lack the ability to support each other. Some treatment programs are workingwith addicts and their families to enhance chances forrecovery and family stability. For example, La Bodegade la Familia, a treatment facility in New York Cityserving families with a relative in the criminal justicesystem, incorporates family members and in-homevisits into the treatment process. La Bodega requiresthat substance abusers have a family member willingto participate in the treatment program to assist casemanagers in developing an action plan for the addictand the family. Since children often suffer because ofthe substance abuse or incarceration of a parent orsibling, family-based interventions are an effectiveway to integrate prevention and treatment. By involving the family in the treatment process, addicts need not be distracted by the risks of losingPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 30 An OJP Issues & Practices Reporttheir children, and at the same time their families serve as support networks in treatment and recovery.Consequently, strengthening family relationships is amajor objective for the following family-based treat-ment programs. Center for Addiction and Pregnancy, Baltimore, Maryland Program Type: Family-Based T reatment. Target Audience: in Operation: 1991-present. Program Goals: To provide multiple types of medical services to substance-abusing women and their families.Contact Information: Center for Addiction and Pregnancy, 410-550-3020; Dr. Lauren Jansson,410-550-3415. Description: The Center for Addiction and Pregnancy (CAP) offers a comprehensive, multidisci-plinary treatment program for substance-abusingwomen and their families. The program, establishedin 1991, is housed in one wing of the Johns HopkinsBayview Medical Center. The CAP program com-bines substance abuse/mental health treatment, pedi-atrics, obstetrics/gynecology, family planning, andnursing. CAP's main goals are to reduce the number and severity of obstetric complications, including HIVinfection; to deliver healthier infants to mothers whono longer abuse drugs or alcohol; to provide effectivefamily planning services acceptable to the patient; andto ensure initial and long-term pediatric assessmentsand care to the infants and siblings of programpatients. Upon admission, women are placed into res-idential care for seven days, during which they receiveeight hours of interdisciplinary, individual, and groupcounseling per day. After this one-week residentialstay, the women are transferred to an outpatientprogram, where they attend six and a half hours ofprogramming each day. As women progress, they gothrough three levels of treatment that lessen in inten-sity in accordance with their progress. Ancillary ser-vices, including methadone maintenance, psychiatrictherapy, and specialized services for HIV-positivewomen are offered when necessary.Prenatal assessment and care are provided by nurse midwives and an obstetrician, and infants aredelivered on the medical center campus. Pediatric careconsists of routine child health care maintenance, aswell as developmental screenings every three monthsand formal psychological assessments at six, 12, and24 months. A structured parenting program providesindividual and group training to all mothers, especial-ly those identified as having exceptional parentingneeds. A children's service coordinator conducts pedi-atric outreach and in-home assessments as well asoverall case management for CAP children and theirsiblings. Participants, primarily from Baltimore, are pre- dominantly African American. The majority ofwomen have less than a high school education, live inpoverty, are single, and have an average of three chil-dren. CAP admits between 35 and 40 women permonth and performs approximately 200 deliveriesannually. Challenges: A challenge to implementing the CAP program was integrating the many disciplinesinvolved. Having all staff members work togetherwithout a particular hierarchy encouraged effectiveworking relationships and facilitated the free flow ofinformation, allowing staff to learn about disciplinesoutside of their expertise. One of the major obstacles currently facing the CAP program is the cost restrictions of managed care.Although the program historically could provide long-term intensive services, women are now much morelimited in their time in the program and access tospecial services. To address this problem, the programis seeking to provide longer-term services throughfoundation grants and state funds. In addition, theprogram is working with managed care companies toaddress the lack of services. Another programmatic challenge is retaining women in treatment. A significant number of womenentering the program drop out quickly. CAP is work-ing on ways to make treatment more user-friendly,such as offering vouchers and hiring treatment advo-cates. The program also provides transportation andchild care to help reduce barriers to treatment.T reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 31Costs and Funding Sources: The total expendi- tures of the program are $3.7 million annually,including salaries for CAP's 37 full-time employees.Funding for the program comes from managed carecompanies and Medicaid. Program Results: A cost-effectiveness study of CAP conducted by researchers at Johns HopkinsUniversity, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,and the Maryland State Alcohol and Drug AbuseAdministration found that providing treatment ser-vices to pregnant women significantly reduced thecosts of medical care for their infants. The evaluationcompared two groups of pregnant drug-abusingwomen\u2014100 who received treatment, and 46 whodid not. Drug use of mothers at time of delivery wasmeasured using urinalysis. The outcomes were asfollows: nThe total neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)costs for infants born to mothers who did notreceive substance abuse treatment totaled$12,183, significantly more than the $900 inNICU costs for the treated women's infants; nFactoring in the $6,639 in costs to provideaddiction treatment services to mothers, totalcost savings of the program were $4,644 permother-infant pair; nInfants born to treated women averaged lessthan one day in NICU, compared with morethan ten days for control group infants; nWomen in treatment were significantly less like-ly to use illicit drugs at the time of deliverythan women who did not participate in treat-ment (37 percent and 63 percent, respectively). nInfants of treated women had a mean birthweight approximately 400 grams heavier and agestational period approximately three weekslonger than the infants whose mothers did notget treatment for drug abuse. The cost-effectiveness study won the 1999 Hazelden Foundation Dan Anderson award, whichhonors clinical research endeavors seeking to improvetreatment services.La Bodega de la Familia, New York, New York Program Type: Family-Based T reatment. Target Audience: Families of drug users. Years in Operation: 1996-present. Program Goals: Provide services to families of drug users to increase the likelihood of drug users remain-ing in treatment.Contact Information: Carol Shapiro, Program Director, 212-982-2335. Description: La Bodega de la Familia, begun in 1996, is an alcohol and other drug treatment programfocusing on families of drug users. The theory behindLa Bodega is that a substance abuser will be more suc-cessful in treatment if supported by their family. LaBodega serves a population of 60,000 in a 56-blockarea of Manhattan's Lower East Side, referred to bylocals as Loisaida. Loisaida was chosen as the programsite by the Vera Institute of Justice because the com-munity has high levels of drug use and related crime(the building housing La Bodega was formerly the siteof a drug market), but also has many churches andhealth clinics providing crucial support to drug usersand their families. The Lower East Side is 33 percentHispanic (largely Puerto Rican), 30 percent Asian, 29percent white, and 8 percent African American.Forty-four percent of the children live in poverty. At La Bodega, case managers help family mem- bers of addicts develop a plan to keep their relatives intreatment. Field counselors offer 24-hour support tofamilies in drug-related emergencies, such as encoun-ters with police or relapse; follow-up on client refer-rals; and act as advocates in law enforcement settings.The program also provides walk-in support and pre-vention services for all neighborhood residents,including clients who no longer need intensive familycase management. Ongoing prevention servicesinclude support groups for young mothers, victimsof family violence, and community members return-ing home after incarceration. The bilingual staff at LaBodega helps families deal with substance abuse-related problems, such as domestic violence, child32 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportabuse, and neglect, HIV/AIDS, and truancy. Programs designed to end the generational cycle ofdrug abuse and criminal activity among youthsinclude mural painting projects, back-to-school nights,and poetry, writing, and photography workshops. On average, La Bodega maintains a caseload of 90 families. To date, La Bodega has served over 1,400individuals. Sixty percent of the families required cri-sis intervention support, 50 percent reported multi-generational substance abuse, 35 percent reportedmultigenerational involvement with the criminal jus-tice system, and 28 percent had histories of domesticviolence. La Bodega is led by two advisory boards, one national and one local. The Community AdvisoryBoard, consisting of service providers, governmentpartners, and community residents, provides expertiseon treatment, helps facilitate referrals, and helpsclients resolve medical, financial, and legal problems.The National Advisory Board consists of family thera-pists, judges, academics, doctors, and law enforce-ment officials who help guide the staff of La Bodegaand put them in touch with other experts across thecountry. Challenges: One of the greatest obstacles in start- ing La Bodega was getting law enforcement andhealth organizations to shift their focus from the indi-vidual to the family. T reatment programs often focusexclusively on the drug user, and law enforcementagencies on the offender. But as La Bodega developed,local agencies saw the wisdom in utilizing the familyas a natural resource. Law enforcement officials real-ized that the program increases public safety becausethe family is the first to know when one of its mem-bers relapses into drug abuse and becomes a possibledanger to the community. In addition, clients of LaBodega are more likely to contact police when danger,such as domestic violence, arises because they have ahealthy relationship with authorities. As an exampleof confidence in La Bodega's services, the New YorkDivision of Parole has assigned four parole officers towork full-time with caseloads comprised solely of LaBodega participants. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget of La Bodega de la Familia is $1.2 million, whichincludes staff salaries, walk-in support services, and24-hour support services. Funding comes from both city and state organizations, including the New YorkCity Department of Mental Health and the New YorkState Department of Parole. For communities interested in implementing a similar program, La Bodega staff recommend addinga family component to an already existing organiza-tion. In New York clients are already receiving treat-ment services funded by the New York Division ofParole; La Bodega incorporates families into the treat-ment to make it more successful. Other programnecessities include a local advisory board consisting ofcriminal justice and health officials and program par-ticipants, a neutral program space within the commu-nity being served, a project coordinator, and onefamily case manager for every 25 families. Program Results: The Vera Institute is currently conducting an evaluation of La Bodega which will becompleted in the spring of 2001. The evaluation willcollect quantitative data from 100 families served byLa Bodega and 100 control families. Funding for theevaluation is being provided by the National Instituteof Justice and the Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels,Robert Wood Johnson, and Jacob and VealeriaLangeloth foundations. Preliminary results on the qualitative aspect of the evaluation are promising. Parole officers involved withthe program are pleased that their relationship with LaBodega allows them to follow up on parolees' treat-ment progress and say they enjoy the opportunity tofocus on the social service aspects of their job. Addictsreport that they are more motivated to succeed intreatment when family members are involved becausethey do not want to disappoint them. T reatmentclients say it is easier to deceive a parole officer, whomthey might see only once a week, about their drug usethan family members they see every day. In 2000, La Bodega plans to incorporate under the umbrella of Family Justice Inc. to provide trainingand technical assistance to criminal justice and treat-ment agencies nationwide. The training will focus onincorporating families into all aspects of substanceabuse treatment. La Bodega is already offering train-ing and technical assistance to national drug courtsand to New York State parole and probation staff.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbusePAR Village: Integrated Addiction and Mental Health Delivery Systems, Largo,Florida Program Type: Family-Based T reatment. Provide gender-specific Information: Debra Dahl, Clinical Director, 727-538-7245. Description: PAR Village is a fully integrated substance abuse and mental health treatment facilitynear Tampa, Florida, that has been providing gender-focused rehabilitation and treatment to chemicallydependent women and their children since 1989.Although PAR Village accepts a wide variety ofwomen and children, its three target populations arewomen who are pregnant, injection drug users, orHIV positive. While some women voluntarily enterthe program, most are referred by the FloridaDepartment of Corrections or the Department ofChildren and Families. Women at PAR Village receive a customized treatment regimen that includes substance abuse class-es, physical rehabilitation, spirituality courses, educa-tional and vocational training, anger managementworkshops, life skills and parenting classes, and careercounseling. Unlike most family-based programs, PARVillage also provides comprehensive services to thechildren of addicted mothers from birth to age 10,including physical therapy, pediatric counseling,speech pathology, Head Start, and occupational coun-seling, among others. A staff of 30 provides services to about 100 women and 60 children each year. Each PAR Villagecase manager, or \"primary counselor,\" is assigned anaverage caseload of ten clients. Primary counselorscoordinate treatment individually for their clients,manage customized treatment regimens, and coordi-nate activities with outside treatment specialists, doc-tors, foster care and social workers, and correctionsdepartment officials. Staff also collaborate with localsocial service agencies and referral sources to ensurethat clients without health insurance can receive need-ed medication.During the course of treatment, women must pass through four stages tailored to their capabilities.Each level has distinct goals, and advancement ismarked by an increase in the level of client responsi-bility. Before a client graduates to the next treatmentstage, progress is evaluated by the professional staffand by the client's peers at PAR Village. Families inthe program reside in ten on-site homes for 16-18months. This home environment, as opposed to dor-mitory style living, provides a more natural atmos-phere for treatment and allows the professional staffto work around the clock with the families. Challenges: PAR Village's family-based strategy was challenged at the outset by foster care workerswho thought that a drug treatment facility was aninappropriate living environment for young children.PAR's good track record persuaded opponents to per-mit the strategy to be tested. Family-based treatmenthas proved to be a successful method of attractingwomen to the program by alleviating the fear of beingseparated from their children and eliminating theneed to find interim child care during the rehabilita-tion process. PAR Village also works with an associa-tion of judges and child welfare officials in Tampa toensure that recovering mothers are not separated fromtheir children as long as they are receiving treatment. Funding has been a persistent problem for PAR Village. After initial grants from the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Center forSubstance Abuse T reatment (CSAT), funding declinedsignificantly. While enough funding was secured tomaintain quality services, the diversity of new fundingsources has led to increased paperwork for the pro-gram's counselors. As a result, staff turnover is rela-tively high. Consequently, PAR Village is attemptingto streamline its administrative procedures to reducethe amount of paperwork assigned to its primarycounselors. Costs and Funding Sources: PAR Village's annu- al budget is $1.6 million. This includes staff salaries,operational costs of the facilities, and administrativecosts. Funding comes from several sources, includingthe Florida Departments of Corrections and Childrenand Families, and the federal Department of Housingand Urban Development. In addition, support comesfrom Head Start, the United Way, Medicaid, andTemporary Assistance for Needy Families. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 33T reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 3334 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 34 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportPAR Village benefits from some special advan- tages that would ordinarily increase overhead costs forany community looking to replicate the program. Theten houses at the facility were donated, as were thevehicles used to transport clients. The 16-acre tract ofland where the facility is situated was provided by alocal resident. Furthermore, many of PAR Village'stherapists and counselors volunteer their services. Program Results: A five-year evaluation of PAR Village, conducted by the University of SouthernFlorida and PAR's own in-house research center,found that six months completing treatment: nNearly two-thirds (64.7 percent) of clients aredrug-free, and 88 percent are arrest-free; n95 percent of clients attain the educational/vocational skills necessary for employment,and more than one-third (35 percent) areemployed; and n73 percent of clients attain custody of theirchildren. PAR Village has been recognized by CSAT and NIDA as a model treatment program. II. Rehabilitating Criminal Offenders Alcohol and other drug problems are the com- mon denominator for most offenders in the criminaljustice system. Drug offenders constitute a rising pro-portion of offenders in U.S. prisons. According to theBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), between 1980 and1996 the number of drug offenders in state prisonsskyrocketed from 19,000 to nearly 240,000. In feder-al prisons during this time, the number grew from4,900 to over 55,000. 55,56According to the National Institute of Justice's Arrestee Drug Abuse MonitoringProgram (ADAM), which tracks drug use amongarrestees in 34 cities, the percentage of men testingpositive for drugs ranges from 42.5 in Anchorage to78.7 in Philadelphia. Among women, percentagesrange from 33.3 in Laredo to 82.1 in New YorkCity. 57According to BJS, four in ten violent offenders were under the influence of alcohol when they com-mitted their crimes. 58Despite the growing numbers of substance abusers in the criminal justice system, treatmentremains scarce. The percentage of inmates whoreported being treated for drug abuse dropped signifi-cantly between 1991 and 1997. One in ten state pris-oners reported receiving treatment in 1997, downfrom one in four in 1991, according to BJS data. 59 Without treatment, three in four offenders are rear-rested within three years, continuing the costly cycleof addiction and crime. Providing treatment tooffenders is a less expensive alternative than incarcer-ating them for future illicit drug and alcohol-relatedcrimes. The most expensive drug treatment programscost about $10,430 per year for each offender, com-pared to $20,142 per year for incarceration. 60 The major contributors to relapse among addic- tion treatment patients are low socioeconomic status,co-occurring psychiatric conditions, and lack of fami-ly or other social supports. Often, criminal offendershave multiple risk factors for relapse, making long-term abstinence even more difficult to achieve.However, treatment even for this population hasresulted in maintained abstinence for some, and sig-nificantly reduced drug use for others, which in turnlead to reduced crime and social costs. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the therapeutic community treatment modelhas been found to be quite effective in reducing druguse and criminal recidivism. 61Therapeutic communi- ties are intensive, long-term, residential treatmentprograms. Program participants are segregated fromthe general prison population so that the \"prisonculture\" does not overwhelm progress toward recov-ery. T reatment gains can be lost if inmates arereturned to the general prison population after treat-ment. Moreover, relapse and criminal recidivism aresignificantly lower if the offender continues treatmentafter returning to the community. A 1996 18-monthfollow-up study of prisoners in Delaware State Prisonfound that inmates who participated in a therapeuticcommunity and continued treatment in a work-release program and aftercare were significantly morelikely to remain drug free than those not treated (76percent versus 19 percent). 62The effects were still visi- ble after three years, with one-third of treated offend-ers remaining drug-free, compared to 5 percent of thecomparison group. 63T reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 35An OJP Issues & Practices Report 35Women are the fastest-growing population in jails and prisons, largely due to drug offenses andcrimes committed to support addiction, like theft andprostitution. Increased use of mandatory minimumsentencing laws for drug offenses has contributed tothe explosive growth of the nation's prison popula-tion. According to the Center for Substance AbuseT reatment, mandated sentencing without the paralleldevelopment of treatment services has had a particu-larly devastating impact on women in prisons. 64In 1997, 79,600 women were serving sentences in feder-al and state prisons, six times the number incarceratedin 1980. 65More than two-thirds of the women inmates in federal prisons have been incarcerated fordrug offenses. 66 The criminal justice system is an important treat- ment entry point which can interrupt and shorten acareer of drug use. The criminal justice system refersdrug offenders into treatment in a variety of ways, suchas diverting nonviolent offenders and stipulating treat-ment as a condition of probation or pretrial release.There are also specialized courts (to be discussed ingreater detail under Alternatives to Incarceration) thathandle drug cases and mandate treatment for partici-pants. According to the National Institute on DrugAbuse, individuals in court-mandated treatment staylonger and perform as well as or better than those whoparticipate in treatment voluntarily. 67The threat of criminal sanctions can be a strong motivator to stay intreatment. Providing treatment to addicted offenders requires collaboration between criminal justice andtreatment systems, which have traditionally operatedwith different goals. Criminal justice and treatmentpersonnel must work together to develop services thatrespond to offenders' overlapping criminal and drugproblems. Such collaborations include client screen-ing, placement, testing, monitoring, and supervision,and the systematic use of sanctions and rewards.Cross-training helps familiarize staff from both systems with each other's philosophy, approach, language, goals, and objectives, and fosters an envi-ronment of mutual respect. The following examples highlight the kinds of programs that show promise for wide replication.Delaware KEY/CREST, Wilmington, Delaware Program Type: Rehabilitating Criminal Offenders. Target Audience: Substance-abusing offenders in Delaware prisons.Years in Operation: 1988-present. Program Goals: Reduce drug use and criminal recidivism.Contact Information: Sandra Buell, Regional Director for KEY/CREST, Spectrum Behavioral Services, 302-325-9500. Kathy English, Delaware Department ofCorrections, 302-739-5601. Description: Alcohol- and other drug-addicted offenders in four Delaware prisons have access to theKEY/CREST program, where they receive substanceabuse treatment in a therapeutic community settingwhile in prison, followed by work-release and after-care services in the community. The KEY program, developed in 1988, provides treatment to inmates in the last 12 to 18 months oftheir incarceration. Offenders learn to change thebehaviors that led them to drug use. Clients arehoused in the therapeutic community setting, sepa-rate from other inmates, and they spend seven days aweek focusing on treatment. To avoid distraction, par-ticipants do not have access to television or tele-phones during the day. T reatment includes individualcounseling, group therapy, educational seminars, HIVeducation, family and parenting education, and 12-step programs. Clients are also encouraged to partici-pate in GED and vocational programs offered by theprison. KEY counselors work with 20 clients at anygiven time. Other staff include a program director, aclinical supervisor, and an administrative assistant. Upon leaving the correctional facilities, KEY participants enter one of three CREST OutreachCenters, which operate work-release programs basedon a therapeutic community model. Developed in1992 as a National Institute on Drug Abuse demon-stration project, CREST is designed to help inmatesmake a smooth transition into society. Residents ofCREST receive six months of intensive substanceabuse treatment presented in two phases. During thefirst three-month phase, clients adapt to life outsideof prison by learning job skills, visiting their familiesand communities, attending AA meetings, and con- tinuing their substance abuse treatment with a strongfocus on relapse prevention. During the next phase,clients work full time in the community but return tothe facility in the evenings. They also take part incommunity service activities as a form of restitutionto the community. After completing CREST, clients go through a six-month aftercare program during which theyreturn to CREST weekly for group sessions, drugtesting, and counseling. At any given time there areapproximately 572 clients in the four KEY programs,328 in the three CREST programs, and an additional350 clients in aftercare. The Delaware Department ofCorrections contracts with Spectrum BehavioralServices to run all three components of the program. Challenges: One of the challenges to implement- ing KEY/CREST was convincing those in the correc-tions field that it was beneficial and cost effective totreat substance-abusing criminal offenders. Many peo-ple in the criminal justice field did not believe that itwas possible to change an offender into a law-abidingcitizen. Changing people's perceptions so that theywould not view the treatment program as merely an\"easy way out\" for offenders required extensive train-ing of the correctional staff. Soon after the programbegan, correctional officers observed that offenders inthe therapeutic communities were less violent thanoffenders in the general prison population. Getting offenders into treatment is an ongoing challenge for KEY/CREST. Some offenders do notbelieve they need treatment and are unwilling to takepart in the rigorous therapeutic community. Delawareprisons have increased the number of participants intreatment by sanctioning offenders who choose not toparticipate and offering incentives to those who do.Offenders who are identified as needing treatment,but are unwilling to participate, are not consideredfor early release (early release is a result of good timecredits and other behavioral incentives). Costs and Funding Sources: KEY/CREST pro- grams are funded through the Delaware Departmentof Corrections. The programs receive approximately$4 million per year from the state, funding treatmentfor approximately 13,000 inmates yearly. It is estimat-ed that treatment costs are $7.50-$8.00 per day foreach offender in the program (this is for treatmentPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse only and does not include food and other services that all inmates receive). Program Results: An evaluation of the CREST program by researchers at the University of Delawareshowed promising results. The evaluation included279 people divided into four groups: CRESTdropouts, CREST graduates without aftercare,CREST graduates with aftercare, and a control groupof offenders with substance abuse problems assignedto a traditional work-release program with little alco-hol and other drug treatment. Three years after releasefrom prison: n69 percent of inmates completing CREST andaftercare remained arrest-free, compared to 55percent of those completing CREST only, 28percent of CREST dropouts, and 29 percentof the control group. n35 percent of inmates completing CREST andaftercare remained drug-free, compared to 27percent who completed CREST, 17 percentwho dropped out, and 5 percent of the com-parison group. Forever Free, Frontera, California Program Type: Rehabilitating Criminal Offenders. Target Audience: Substance-abusing women in California prisons.Years in Operation: 1991-present. Program Goals: Provide alcohol and other drug treat- ment to incarcerated women and encourage them tocontinue treatment after their release.Contact Information: The Department of Corrections Office of Substance Abuse Programs, ContractManager, 916-327-3707, or David Conn at MentalHealth Systems Inc., 619-689-2633. Description: Since 1991, Forever Free has been providing substance abuse treatment to inmates at theCalifornia Institute for Women (CIW) in Frontera.Developed through a partnership between theCalifornia Department of Corrections and theDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Programs, ForeverFree has provided approximately 4,000 femaleinmates with substance abuse treatment. 36 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportthis problem, CIW tries to engage women in the pro- gram as soon as they enter prison. Women who areserving only a few months in prison are also allowedinto the program if they agree to enter a residentialtreatment facility upon their release. Costs and Funding Sources: The total budget for the program during FY 1999/2000 was approxi-mately $1.6 million. Nearly half of the budget,$739,000, is for post-release community treatmentservices. The remaining amount includes programstaff, staff training, and in-prison treatment. TheDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Programs also setsaside community treatment beds for Forever Free par-ticipants at no cost. Program Results: The California Department of Corrections contracted with an evaluator to examinethe impact of Forever Free on program participantswho left prison in 1995 and 1996. The evaluationcompared four groups of women: all women whoentered the program, women who dropped out of theprogram, women who received only the in-prisonprogram, and women who continued to receive treat-ment after being paroled. Program retention duringthese years was high; 94.8 percent of women complet-ed the program. Women who completed the in-prisonprogram and at least three months of communitytreatment fared the best. T welve months after parole: nOnly 9 percent of women receiving 120 days or more of community treatment were re-incarcerated; and n38 percent of women who dropped out of theprogram and 39 percent of the in-prison onlygroup had returned to custody versus 32 per-cent of women receiving continuing care. T wenty-four months after parole: nOnly 25 percent of women receiving more than 120 days of treatment after being paroledwere returned to custody after two years; and n60 percent of program drop-outs were reincar-cerated, compared to 48 percent of the contin-uing care group. Despite changes in staff and prison management, Forever Free has sustained effective programming forMost women who participate in Forever Free do so voluntarily. When offenders enter the prison sys-tem, they are screened for substance abuse. If they arefound to have an alcohol or other drug problem andmeet the criteria for entering the program (such asadequate length of stay in prison and no violent his-tory), prison officials suggest they volunteer. Somewomen are involuntarily placed in the program byprison officials. Participants in Forever Free are housed separately from other inmates in a 240-bed facility. They spendfour hours a day at prison work assignments, such ascooking or grounds work, and four hours a day intreatment. There are two treatment tracks, one lastingfour months and the other six. T rack placementdepends on length of incarceration. Women who aresentenced to more than six months may remain inForever Free for the duration of their sentence. The State Department of Corrections contracts with Mental Health Systems Inc. to run the treatmentprogram. Forever Free utilizes a behavioral changeapproach, and treatment includes counseling, relapseprevention, problem solving, re-socialization, 12-stepgroups, and case management. Women's issues, suchas dependency, physical and sexual abuse, and copingwith the stress of motherhood are also addressed.Prior to parole, transition plans are developed for pro-gram participants which detail their arrangements foremployment, housing, and further treatment. Clientsare encouraged to voluntarily enter community resi-dential substance abuse treatment, funded by thestate, upon parole. The State Department ofCorrections contracts with community treatmentproviders, who reserve a number of beds for ForeverFree clients at a reasonable cost. Thirty percent of program participants are African American, 23 percent are Hispanic, and 44percent are white. The average age of clients is 35.Forever Free serves approximately 720 clients per yearand has a staff of 17, including 13 counselors, onesupervising counselor, one transition counselor, anadministrative assistant, and a project director. Challenges: The biggest obstacle for Forever Free is finding qualified inmates. Because most inmates inCIW are serving short terms for lesser offenses such asparole violation, they often do not remain in prisonlong enough to receive successful treatment.

Movementthrough the phases depends on the individual client'sprogress; there is no specified duration for any phase.After completion of the program, some offendersserve as role models for program participants andassist in facilitating group activities. Upon prison release, New Vision participants enter a community aftercare program that helps themreintegrate into society. Offenders are paroled to athree-month residential work-release program, whichis followed by up to 12 months of outpatient counsel-ing. Participants meet with their parole officers regu-larly, undergo monthly urine tests, and have frequentcontact with case managers to review progress andany problems. New Vision staff consist of a program director, two administrative staff, a family therapist, a trainingcoordinator, and 26 counselors. There is one coun-selor for every 20 clients. The program also utilizesvolunteer interns from local colleges and universities. Challenges: The biggest obstacle to creating New Vision was convincing therapists, who had beentrained to work within a different model of treatment,to try the therapeutic community model. To convincethem, program developers used evidence of other suc-cessful in-prison therapeutic communities. Anotherproblem was achieving cooperation between the treat-ment and correctional staff, which was addressedthrough cross-training, allowing staff to learn moreabout the treatment model and to appreciate the vari-ous roles in the in-prison treatment design. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget for New Vision is $1.4 million. Program funding isprovided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justiceand the Texas Department of Substance AbuseT reatment. In order to replicate the program, qualifiedstaff would be required, including a program director,administrative staff, and a counselor to client ratio of1:20. Staff training would also be a significant cost. Program Results: A 1997 three-year follow-up study of 394 New Vision participants was conductedby researchers at Texas Christian University.Recidivism rates were examined for three groups ofoffenders: prison treatment and aftercare, aftercaredropout, and an untreated comparison group. Oneof the major findings of the evaluation was that almost ten years. A major accomplishment of the pro- gram is that 50 percent of participants agree to entera residential treatment program upon release fromprison. New Vision Therapeutic Community, Kyle, Texas Program Type: Rehabilitating Criminal Offenders. Target Audience: Substance-abusing prison inmates in Texas.Years in Operation: 1992-present. Program Goals: Provide substance abuse treatment and other services to inmates to help them succeed afterprison.Contact Information: Shirlee Livingston, Program Director, 512-268-0264. Description: New Vision, begun in 1992, was the first in-prison therapeutic community in Texas.Currently, the program is offered in four Texas pris-ons and has been replicated in Oklahoma and NewMexico. The primary goal of the program is to pro-vide residents with the skills necessary to live as pro-ductive members of society after their release fromprison. In order to be considered for the treatmentprogram, offenders must be assessed as having a sub-stance abuse problem, be in the last nine to 12months of their sentence, and need only medium orless security. New Vision serves 520 clients in its pro-gram (approximately 750 offenders per year). New Vision provides clients with educational sem- inars and lectures, therapeutic groups, individual andgroup counseling, and 12-step meetings. Counseling isalso offered to offenders and their families onSaturdays and Sundays. The program consists of threephases: orientation, main treatment, and re-entry.During orientation, offenders are introduced to thetherapeutic community and learn the rules and poli-cies of the program. They also become familiar withthe concepts of substance abuse, the addictionprocess, and relapse. During the main treatment phase of the pro- gram, participants begin to identify the problemscontributing to their addiction, accept responsibilityfor their addiction, and formulate long- and short-term recovery goals. During the last phase, re-entry,clients and counselors design relapse prevention andPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 38 An OJP Issues & Practices Report38 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportT reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 39completion of the New Vision aftercare component is a critical factor in maintaining treatment success. Therecidivism rates were as follows: nprison treatment and aftercare 25 percent naftercare dropout 64 percent nuntreated 42 percent The study further divided the subjects by severi- ty. High-severity offenders had more serious criminaland drug-related problems and were viewed as morelikely to be reincarcerated. However, offenders com-pleting treatment and aftercare had significantly lowerrecidivism rates than dropouts and untreated offend-ers. Recidivism rates for the high- and low-severityoffenders were as follows: High-severity nprison treatment and aftercare 26 naftercare dropout percent nuntreated 52 percent Low-severity nprison treatment and aftercare 22 percent naftercare dropout 52 percent nuntreated 29 percent III. Assessing and Treating Adolescents The number of adolescents in alcohol and other drug abuse treatment programs increased by morethan a third between 1992 and 1997; however, youngpeople continue to be greatly underserved. 68Accord- ing to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse(1999), of an estimated one million youths ages 12 to17 assessed as drug dependent, only 175,000 hadreceived treatment. 69Since most substance abuse treat- ment is designed for adult addicts, appropriate servic-es for adolescents can be hard to find. According tothe federal Center for Substance Abuse T reatment(CSAT), less than one percent of the more than 6,700publicly funded treatment programs nationwide aredesigned exclusively for adolescents. 70Adolescent users differ from adult users in many ways. Young teens begin with experimentation andoccasional use, while adults have often experienced adecade or more of addiction and have developedsevere problems, such as job loss, criminal histories,and medical complications. The types of drugs abusedalso tend to vary with age. Marijuana and alcohol arethe most prevalent among treatment clients under age18, while opiates and cocaine are associated with old-er clients. Adolescents also have unique treatmentneeds. Teen treatment models tend to be less con-frontational than treatment for adults. Concurrentmental illness, legal problems, educational needs, fam-ily and community environment, and emotional,intellectual, and physical development must all beconsidered in planning effective youth treatment. T reatment for adolescents should incorporate a wide range of social services, provide aftercare servicesto reinforce progress, and encourage family involve-ment. Teaching parents the skills to support theirchildren through treatment can enhance family stabil-ity and increase chances for success. Learning toappropriately monitor their children and identifywarning signs of relapse enables parents to participatein their children's recovery. Teen treatment programs should consider youths' ethnicity and gender when designing services. Norms,values, and health beliefs may differ across cultures,and these factors can have a significant impact ontreatment. Gender-related factors also affect an ado-lescent's involvement in treatment. For example, ado-lescent females may require more attention withregard to problems such as sexual abuse. Most adolescent treatment that does exist is aimed at youths with serious drug habits; relativelyfew are designed to help teens who are just beginningto develop problems. As a result, these teens are oftenreferred to programs focused on severely troubledaddicts, which may exacerbate rather than reducetheir drug use. Different levels of pathology requiredifferent treatment environments; not all programsare equally effective for young people. Early interven-tion offered through a school-based student assistanceprogram, for example, can substantially reduce drink-ing and marijuana use before more intensive servicesare needed and is far less costly than making treat-ment available only after teens develop an addiction,drop out of school, or commit crimes. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 39While programs designed for adolescents are still scarce, the following examples highlight how commu-nities are utilizing successful approaches to treatyoung people. The Bridge, Columbia, South Carolina Program Type: Assessing and T reating Juveniles. Target Audience: Juveniles recently released from prison or inpatient substance abuse treatment.Years in Operation: 1994-present. Program Goals: Provide aftercare services to youths to assist them in making the transition from institution-alization to the community.Contact Information: Katherine Yandle Thornton, Coordinator of Juvenile Justice Services, SouthCarolina Department of Alcohol and Other DrugAbuse Services, 803-734-4184. Description: The Bridge, begun in 1994 as a Center for Substance Abuse T reatment demonstrationproject, is a family-centered program designed to pre-vent juveniles from returning to prison or inpatientsubstance abuse treatment. The program is sponsoredby the South Carolina Department of Alcohol andOther Drug Services and is recognized as a promisingapproach to juvenile alcohol and other drug treatmentby the American Probation and Parole Associationand the Office of Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention. The program is offered in seven countiesin the state. The goal of The Bridge is to improve alcohol and other drug treatment outcomes for adolescents leav-ing, or in danger of entering, residential treatment orjuvenile justice facilities. The program strives toreduce alcohol and other drug use, juvenile offending,dropping out of school, high-risk sexual activity, andviolent behavior. Clients are 80 percent male and 48percent African American. Participants, on average,are between 15 and 16 years old, have more thanthree delinquency referrals, and a family incomeunder $15,000. Criminal behavior has occurred inmore than half the families, and the majority ofclients' households are headed by a single mother.Nearly three-quarters of the clients are referred by theDepartment of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), with most ofthe remainder being referred by inpatient alcohol andother drug treatment facilities. The program servesapproximately 240 clients annually.In addition to developing more youth-specific treatment approaches, it is important to screen youngpeople to identify those most likely to need treat-ment, such as teens who exhibit warning signs ofabuse, including substantial behavioral changes, sig-nificant changes in academic performance, traumainjuries, and contact with the juvenile justice or childwelfare systems. Homeless and runaway teens in shel-ters and all teens who receive mental health assess-ments should be screened for addiction treatmentneeds. According to the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration, adolescents withsevere emotional and behavioral problems are signifi-cantly more likely to have substance abuse problemsthan other adolescents. Involvement in the juvenile justice system is an important consideration when developing appropriatesubstance abuse treatment for teens. According toCSAT, programs designed for this population shouldbe holistic and include juvenile justice, substanceabuse treatment, schools, community-based organiza-tions, and other providers of health and social servicesin one plan. Case management is critical to coordi-nate services for these children and to act as the cen-tral monitoring and tracking source for each child. CSAT identifies essential elements to treating juvenile offenders in Strategies for Integrating Substance Abuse Treatment and the Juvenile Justice System(1999). 71They include: nFocusing treatment on risk factors associatedwith criminal behavior, such as antisocial atti-tudes and peers, rather than on risk factorsthat are not particularly associated with crimi-nal behavior, such as self-esteem; nConcentrating more intensive services onthose who are at risk of re-offending; and nOffering comprehensive treatment thataddresses all related behaviors, especially theneed for academic and vocational educationand work skills training. Since juveniles placed in detention facilities are unlikely to receive the special programs necessary fortreatment or reintegration into society, alternativeplacements have increased dramatically in recentyears. Options include intensive community supervi-sion, day treatment, evening and weekend programs,and tutoring.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 40 An OJP Issues & Practices Report40 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportMinimum program start-up expenses include staff development and salaries, wrap-around services,and client incentives. Program staff include one casemanager for every 22 to 25 youths, a part-timeadministrator, and a project director to supervise theprogram. In South Carolina, the Department ofAlcohol and Other Drug Services assigns one of itsstaff as program director in each county to TheBridge at no cost. Wrap-around services cost approxi-mately $1,100 per youth annually. In South Carolina,The Bridge staff from across the state meet once amonth for training and meetings, which helps booststaff morale. Client incentives can include tee-shirts,hats, or any other items which might encourageyouth to continue in the program. Program Results: The Bridge contracts with an independent evaluator who monitors the progress ofclients and reports on trends. Results of the ongoingevaluation are promising: nReduced Recidivism: One year after program discharge, only 19 percent of program partici-pants (including those who did not completethe program) have been reincarcerated, andonly 16 percent have been readmitted to inpa-tient treatment programs. Only 10 percent ofyouths completing the program have beenreincarcerated. nIncreased Abstinence: At time of graduation, 78 percent of the clients are abstinent and anadditional 11 percent have reduced their levelof use. Among program drop-outs, 27 percentare abstinent and another 22 percent havereduced their level of use. nImproved Vocational and EducationalPerformance: Since the program began, 85 per- cent of program graduates versus 64 percent ofprogram drop-outs have completed highschool; 71 percent of graduates are successfullyemployed versus 30 percent of drop-outs. nReduced Costs to State: Since 1994, the pro- gram has saved the state $800,000 in incarcer-ation costs alone. (This number was derivedby comparing one-year recidivism rates of TheBridge clients, 18.7 percent, versus averagejuvenile recidivism rates, 40 percent.)Since making the transition from institutional settings into the community can be difficult foryouths and their families, The Bridge offers gradual\"step-down\" services. The program consists of threephases: intensive assessment, intensive care manage-ment, and continuing care. First, program staff assessthe youngsters through interviews, home visits, andinteragency communication about the family's historyand needs. Based on the four- to six-week assessmentperiod, a treatment plan is developed. Next, the clientreceives four to six weeks of intensive case manage-ment during which the case manager maintains dailycontact with the adolescent, the family, and any agen-cies involved in the case. Clients receive intensiveservices, including alcohol and other drug treatmentand home-based support. Services are also availablefor family members to help them improve their par-enting skills and to create a healthy home environ-ment for their child. Once clients achieve abstinenceand improve areas, such as school performance andfamily relations, they are moved to continuing care.Continuing care lasts up to seven months and pro-vides clients with less intensive treatment and services.At the culmination of continuing care, a formal grad-uation is held. Challenges: The greatest obstacle to implement- ing The Bridge was convincing the DJJ that youthalcohol and other drug use is a major problem. TheBridge staff succeeded in doing this by providingbackground information and education about thescope of the problem. In the past two years TheBridge has seen a decline in the educational success ofthe clients they serve, due in part to new zero toler-ance policies at schools which often target youthswith substance abuse problems. Another factor is thatThe Bridge serves more older clients (17 years old)than when the program began, who are at higher riskfor dropping out of school. Program staff are workingwith school officials to help keep The Bridge clientsenrolled in school. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget of The Bridge is $714,845, which includes costs ofpersonnel, evaluation, wrap-around services such asdrug testing and transportation, staff training, andclient incentives. The program receives $300,000from the South Carolina Department of Alcohol andOther Drug Services and $418,845 from matchingfederal block grant funds.

Services are provided based onspecific needs of each juvenile and family. The Network employs seven full-time staff and coordinates services for approximately 600 juvenileoffenders per year. The Network is directed by a localcoordinating committee composed of 40 representa-tives of member organizations. Challenges: Because the Network is the creation of many established organizations, it was a challengeto create an appropriate forum for discussion and collaborative problem solving. The Network's leadagency, the Denver Juvenile Court, linked it to asmaller, previously existing network to help guide theprocess during the start-up phase. A second challenge was the need to integrate progressive, results-oriented thinking into establishedsystems. The Network responded by analyzing eachorganization and system, identifying similar philoso-phies and ideals, and building linkages based on thesecommon elements. The Network then coordinated aseries of staff training sessions to familiarize the mem-ber organizations with new methodologies. Cost and Funding Sources: The Network's origi- nal 1995 CSAT grant was $1 million. The annualbudget for the Network is $676,000 and includesstaff, facilities, equipment, evaluation costs, MISdevelopment, and administrative costs. The averagecost per client is $2,126, which covers the servicesthey receive from assessment through program termi-nation. In addition to the CSAT grant, the Networkreceives financial support from federal block grants,the City and County of Denver, various state alcoholand other drug abuse programs, the Denver PublicSchool System, and the Rose Foundation. Program Results: In 1999 the Network contract- ed with Human Resources Consortium, a privateconsulting firm, to evaluate the effectiveness of theprogram.

Program Goals: Coordinate alcohol and other drug treatment agencies serving juveniles.Contact Information: Jennifer Mankey, Project Director, 303-893-6898. Description: A major obstacle to treating youths in the juvenile justice system is the fragmented sys-tems designed for these children. To address thisproblem, the Denver Juvenile Justice IntegratedT reatment Network was created to provide seamlessand comprehensive substance abuse services to juve-nile offenders from initial contact through parole.The Network coordinates services among more than100 participating agencies, including state and localjuvenile justice and law enforcement agencies, welfareand social services providers, substance abuse andmental health organizations, public schools and uni-versities, and community coalitions. With funds fromthe Center for Substance Abuse T reatment (CSAT),the Denver Juvenile Court created the Network in1995. Network services include screening, assessment, referral, case management, treatment and rehabilita-tion, family advocacy, and health services for offendersages 10 to 21. In the five years since its develop-ment, the Network has helped to standardize servicesamong its participating member organizations. Amanagement information system (MIS) facilitates thesharing of information between agencies. A stream-lined network of providers enables more comprehen-sive assessment and screening procedures, which helpsensure that a juvenile's multiple needs are met. As aresult, issues of gender and culture are being regularlyaddressed in treatment, as is family advocacy. Each point of entry in the juvenile justice system performs a preliminary substance use screen to identi-fy the degree of substance abuse. Referrals from boththe juvenile justice system and social services are sentto one central point for referral. Case managers, whoare certified alcohol and other drug abuse counselors,and staff from some participating agencies conductPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 42 An OJP Issues & Practices Report42 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportaddicts in treatment, reduce substance abuse, and improve other areas of social functioning. For substance abusers with multiple needs, case managers help link clients with appropriate services.According to the Center for Substance Abuse T reat-ment (CSAT), case management enhances treatmentsuccess by retaining clients in treatment and ensuringtheir needs are met. CSAT identifies the functions ofa case manager in Comprehensive Case Management for Substance Abuse Treatment: Treatment ImprovementProtocol 27 (1998) 73: nProvide the client a single point of contact for multiple health and social services systems; nAdvocate for the client; nBe flexible, community-based, and client-oriented; and nAssist the client with needs generally thoughtto be outside the realm of substance abusetreatment. Addiction, as science has revealed, is a chronic, recurring disease that requires lifelong management.Clients often need help remaining abstinent followingtreatment, particularly when a recovering addict re-enters the community and faces old temptations.Providing aftercare services, such as group or individ-ual counseling, 12-step meetings, relapse prevention,vocational training and employment, primary andmental health care, and parenting/family skills train-ing can prevent or delay relapse. Case management isoften used to coordinate services. Attempts to treat homeless substance abusers tend to be ineffective due to the multiple risk factors thatoften accompany homelessness, such as co-occurringmental disorders. Recruitment of these addicts intotreatment programs also poses a challenge, and forthose who do enter treatment, dropout rates are high.There are a few innovative approaches however, show-ing promise for treating this group. National Instituteon Drug Abuse-sponsored programs in New YorkCity and Birmingham, Alabama, address patientrecruitment and retention problems by coordinatingefforts with homeless shelters and social service agen-cies. They move patients from highly structured inter-ventions to more flexible treatment as patientsprogress toward self-sufficiency by living with peers,nPositive family relationships improved from 24percent to 40 percent; and nAbility to respect and follow the law grewfrom 20 percent to 47 percent. A 1998 survey of key decision makers in partici- pating member agencies involved in the Networkfound an overwhelming majority surveyed (95 per-cent) reported the Network had a positive impact oninformation sharing; 84 percent reported theNetwork improved services to juveniles. The Denver Juvenile Justice Integrated T reatment Network has been recognized by Harvard'sJohn F . Kennedy School of Government as \"an out-standing innovation in government.\" The RobertWood Johnson Foundation is funding replicationprojects based on the Denver model in communitiesnationwide. IV. Connecting with the Community Substance abuse treatment often encompasses more than treating addiction; it also involves helpingclients prevent relapse when treatment ends. Voca-tional and educational training, and access to healthcare and other social services, are provided by manytreatment programs to help prepare their clients forlife in the community when the structure and super-vision of treatment are no longer there to supportthem. In addition to helping treatment participantsre-enter society, some programs serve another vitalfunction in the community by reaching out to theunderserved (such as homeless addicts and those athigh-risk for HIV) to engage them in treatment. During the past decade the gap between treat- ment clients' needs for support services and the avail-ability of those services has grown. According to a1995 analysis of outpatient treatment conducted bythe Research T riangle Institute in Raleigh, NorthCarolina, 60 percent of the clients did not receivesupport services in 1993, compared with 18 percentin 1981. 72This decline reflected a substantial reduc- tion in federal support for treatment-related servicesnationwide.

Target Audience: Homeless alcohol and other drug addicts.Years in Operation: 1991-present. Program Goals: Provide services to the homeless and help them design long-term goals.Contact Information: Dr. Cecelia McNamara, Project Director/Investigator, 205-934-8960. Description: In 1991 the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) jointly funded aproject in Birmingham to study effective addictiontreatments for people who are homeless. Since then,researchers from the University of Alabama atBirmingham in partnership with BirminghamHealthcare for the Homeless have been developingand testing successful treatment models for homelesscrack cocaine abusers through NIDA grants. The Birmingham program involves homeless clients in six hours of treatment a day, five days aweek, over a two-month period. Clients receivepsycho-educational and behavioral group therapy,individual counseling, and assessment by a psycholo-gist or post-doctoral fellow. Clients set long-termgoals to address their problems with drug abuse,housing, employment, mental illness, and social/recreational activity. Clients meet with counselorsweekly to set short-term objectives which are designedto help achieve the long-term goals. Weekly sessionsare held in which clients rate their own progress aswell as that of other clients. T ransportation to and from treatment and lunch are provided. Day treatment is followed by tenmonths of aftercare (once-a-week group sessions)and individual counseling as needed. The programemploys a tracker who assists with follow-up and goesto shelters, crack houses, and abandoned buildings tobring clients back to treatment.paying rent, and working. In Birmingham clients par- ticipate in \"contingency management\" programs thatmake access to housing and employment contingenton staying clean. Program evaluation found partici-pants in the contingency management programremained abstinent from drugs substantially longerthan other patients. HIV prevention is an increasingly critical part of drug treatment. Drug use is now the major risk factorin new cases of AIDS, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis inthe United States. 74Alcohol abuse may also increase an individual's risk of exposure to HIV by decreasingthe likelihood of condom use. 75Drug injectors who do not enter treatment are up to six times more likelyto become infected with HIV than injectors whoparticipate in treatment. 76T reatment presents disease prevention opportunities, including screening, coun-seling, and referral for additional services. Needle exchange programs designed to stop the transmission of HIV and hepatitis among injectiondrug users are controversial. Critics believe they pro-mote illegal drug use. However, the U.S. GeneralAccounting Office and the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention have found that needleexchange programs do not increase drug use and areeffective in reducing the spread of HIV and hepatitisB. 77According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Sixth Triennial Report to Congress (1999), com- prehensive programs that include needle exchange,community-based outreach, and drug treatmentremain the most cost-effective approaches to avertingnew HIV infections. 78 Alcoholics and other drug addicts often have sig- nificant difficulty staying clean when they re-enter thesame community that fostered their substance abuse.Programs that help train people for jobs, help themfind employment and housing, and link them withother social services can facilitate the transition. Inaddition, some people in the community are in need oftreatment services but, due to a lack of access or moti-vation, are not receiving them. Community outreach iscritically important in engaging these individuals intreatment. The following examples highlight how treat-ment programs are connecting with communities.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 44 An OJP Issues & Practices Report44 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportA unique treatment component of Healthcare for the Homeless is the use of contingency rules, whichmake housing and work dependent on drug-free liv-ing. Housing is provided after clients have severalconsecutive negative drug screens. To remain in hous-ing, participants must remain drug-free. Upon testingpositive, participants are immediately placed in a shel-ter until they again demonstrate abstinence throughtwo consecutive clean tests. Clients can participate infour months of a work program, where they receivevocational training in construction (refurbishinghousing for other homeless people in the program) oreducational training. The program has 2.5 full-time substance abuse counselors, a housing manager, a recreation therapist,a vocational counselor, and various personnel involvedin job training, administration, transportation, orother aspects of the program. Counselors haveapproximately seven to ten individual clients in daytreatment at any given time and up to 60 clients inaftercare. Challenges: The first major obstacle was arranging to cooperate with the housing authority administrationin time to meet deadlines and provide necessary docu-mentation for a collaborative study. In the secondphase of the program, a challenge was getting psychia-trists to prescribe medications for cocaine-abusingclients. Most of these clients are now sent to a clinicrun by the Salvation Army. Staff turnover and theproblem of finding homes suitable for rehabilitationare also pressing issues. Obstacles have been overcomethrough perseverance by the clinical and researchteams who have forged alliances within the localcommunity. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget has not been calculated because research-specific costscomprise such a substantial part of the budget.However, treatment costs have been calculated. Inthe first phase of treatment (including enhanced daytreatment for two months), cost per client was$3,177; during the second phase (which includedabstinent contingent work and housing for fourmonths), cost per client was $3,476; during the thirdphase (including counseling as needed, weekly after-care groups, and drug testing for six months), costper client was $599. Total program cost for one yearwas $7,212 per client.Major costs to implement the program include administration, facility fees, salaries, cost of day treat-ment (counseling, food, transportation), urine moni-toring ($684/client), housing purchases, materials andtools (a total of $80,000 for two houses annually),and stipends for clients in the vocational program($2,307/client). Program Results: Outcomes have been measured in two different studies conducted by researchers atthe University of Alabama at Birmingham. In the firststudy, the enhanced homeless treatment package(DT+) was compared with usual care (UC), whichconsisted of weekly individual and group counselingsessions and case management for work and housingreferrals. Overall, greater reductions were found inDT+ than UC for alcohol use (self-report), cocaineuse (measured by urine toxicology), and days home-less at two, six, and 12 month follow-ups. In the second study the enhanced treatment package (DT+) was compared to day treatment alone(DT). Consecutive weeks of abstinence as measuredby urine toxicology were significantly greater for DT+during the first six months of treatment (at sixmonths, DT+ averaged 9.1 consecutive weeks cleanversus DT at 3.99 weeks). Days housed were also sig-nificantly higher in DT+. In addition, the secondstudy demonstrated reductions in AIDS risk behav-iors as a result of day treatment (number of differentsex partners decreased from 7.5 at baseline to 2.3 postday treatment, and the number of times trading sexfor crack decreased from 6.6 at baseline to 0.11 postday treatment).

Program Goals: Provide treatment, job training, and other social services through a self sufficient program.Contact Information: Larry Fehr, Senior Vice President, 206-322-6645, ext. 211. Description: Pioneer Human Services (PHS) has provided job training to ex-offenders and substanceabusers since 1962. The nonprofit organization serves An OJP Issues & Practices Report 45T reatment An OJP Issues & Practices Report 45over 6,000 people each year in its employment/ training, treatment, community corrections, andresidential facilities. Since the program began, PHShas served more than 50,000 clients. In 1999, PHSclients were 34 percent female, 49 percent white, and30 percent African American. The program employs1,100 staff members, and 70 percent of the $55 mil-lion annual operating budget is financed by the pro-gram's industrial activities. The first phase of PHS programming is provided by its community corrections and behavioral healthdivisions. Behavioral health offers residential and out-patient alcohol and other drug, mental health, andcase management services to clients living in PHSsubstance-free transitional residences, including a153-bed chemical dependency facility (PioneerCenter North) and over 600 units of low-incomehousing. T reatment services vary depending on theneeds of the client. Pioneer Center North, for exam-ple, serves severe alcohol and other drug addicts whohave been involuntarily assigned to the program bycivil courts. In 1999, 2,638 people were served bybehavioral health. Community corrections operatessix correctional residences for adults and juvenileswith a total of 239 beds. Four of the residences arework-release residential facilities for men and women,and two are for juvenile male offenders sentenced todetention by the courts. In 1999, a total of 1,360were served by the community corrections division. Clients from the community corrections and behavioral health divisions are recruited for the sec-ond phase of PHS, the employment and training pro-grams. In 1999 about 80 percent of PHS enterprisesemployees were recruited from PHS-run correctionsand treatment programs. Clients receive training inone of the businesses operated by PHS, which includetwo food service businesses, two food distributioncompanies, a printing company, a real estate manage-ment office, two manufacturing plants, and a consult-ing service. The businesses serve such firms as Hasbro,Starbucks, Nintendo, and Microsoft. After receivingjob training from PHS, which lasts from three weeksto 18 months depending on the degree of specializa-tion required, clients participate in a graduation cere-mony. After graduating, clients can opt to remainwith PHS or find employment elsewhere in the community.Challenges: The greatest obstacle to implementing the program was getting staff from different fields towork together, social service workers being client-focused and business managers tending to look more at profits. Since PHS is both a business and a social ser-vice agency, all staff members had to modify their out-look. The collaboration has paid off, and provision ofsocial services have improved, because like a business,PHS now focuses on obtaining results. PHS collectsdata to measure its effectiveness in helping clients.Among the 200 monthly outcome indicators measuredare improved cognitive skills, decreased risk of sub-stance abuse, and successful transition into the com-munity. The business personnel have also benefitted bylearning to focus on the personal health of the clientsin addition to the financial health of the company. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget for Pioneer Human Services is $55 million, whichcovers all services, including its business enterprises,educational and treatment programs, housing, andstaff costs. Seventy percent of the budget comes fromthe revenues of its business operations. The remaindercomes from contracts with federal, state, and localagencies. Pioneer Consulting Services (PCS) was recently created to help nonprofit organizations explore entre-preneurial options and develop systems for measuringtheir outcomes. The cost is $800 per day in consult-ing fees; however, this price varies depending onwhether PCS provides a one-time consultation orongoing services. Program Results: A case study of PHS, funded by the Ford and Annie E. Casey Foundations andconducted by researchers at the University ofWashington, was completed in January 2000. Thestudy found that PHS clients had lower recidivismrates compared to ex-offenders in another workrelease program (6.4 percent versus 15.4 percent). Inaddition, with funding from the Ford Foundation,PHS recently initiated a longitudinal study of pro-gram graduates in the community. One of the pri-mary findings is that one year after release from PHSjob training, 96.6 percent of clients are employed. In addition, according to internal program data, PHS graduates pass workplace drug tests morePromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 46 An OJP Issues & Practices Report46 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportthe general workforce in 1998.79PHS programs have been featured in articles in Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, andForbes.frequently than the general public.

Illicit drug and alcohol-related crime includes a broad range of illegalactivity\u2014possession or sale of illicit drugs, crimes to obtain money to buy drugs, driv-ing under the influence of alcohol, underage drinking, and crimes such as child abuseand domestic violence resulting from illicit drug and alcohol abuse. The myriad crimi-nal offenses related to substance abuse require various approaches, and criminal justicepersonnel\u2014from police officers to corrections personnel to judges\u2014are well-positionedto affect the amount of alcohol- and other drug-related crime in communities. Law enforcement efforts are often dependent on local factors, such as personnel and financial resources, populations served, and the nature of drug problems. Despitedifferences in community characteristics many police agencies focus significantresources on local drug problems. The following section details some of the differentstrategies used by law enforcement and criminal justice agencies to address illicit drugand alcohol abuse, and related crime: community policing, problem-oriented polic-ing, reducing drug availability, and alternatives to incarceration. Often, these strate-gies overlap. In addition to these four strategies, alcohol-related approaches arediscussed in depth. Drug enforcement has evolved over the decades. T raditionally, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies had focused primarily on wholesale drug activity,often using specialized narcotics units. The introduction of crack cocaine in the mid-1980s led local police to focus more on retail street sales. In addition, since the late1980s, many communities have mobilized grassroots groups to respond to local ille-gal drug and alcohol problems; these community coalitions can serve as valuable part-ners for law enforcement agencies. In many jurisdictions, police partner with andmake referrals to various social, health, and legal agencies. By linking law enforce-ment with social services, police improve the overall quality of their responses. Law enforcement officers working with community residents to reduce illicit drug and alcohol-related crime and improve quality of life is a growing trend in citiesand towns nationwide. Community policing evolved out of foot patrol experimentsin the 1980s. Putting officers back on the beat has helped them become regular fix-tures in communities and increases police legitimacy in the eyes of residents. Police departments are now training landlords and community leaders to imple- ment problem-solving techniques to deter drug use on their properties and withintheir neighborhoods. Close relationships with community agencies can help policeidentify and refer individuals in need of substance abuse services. Working with thecommunity is a central tenet of problem-oriented policing, which trains the officer toassess why crimes occur in certain areas, to identify circumstances contributing tothose crimes, and to decide how to best solve crime problems. Police tactics are crucial to reducing the availability of illicit drugs and alcohol. Targeting of hot spots of criminal activity by the police can make the buying and sell-ing of illegal drugs more risky, thereby decreasing trafficking and related crime.50 An OJP Issues & Practices Report50 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportConfronting establishments that sell alcohol to minors minimizes underage drinking and the prob-lems that often accompany it, such as driving underthe influence and delinquency. Probation and paroleofficers can reduce drug use and criminal recidivismby referring offenders with substance abuse problemsto treatment. Corrections officials can reduce theavailability of drugs in prison through programs thattest and sanction prisoners for drug use. Judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys can take advantage of alternatives to incarceration pro-grams that combine criminal sanctions and accounta-bility with substance abuse treatment. Drug courtsenable judges to use their sentencing power to getsubstance-abusing offenders into treatment, while stillholding them accountable for their crimes. This chapter discusses various promising law enforcement approaches that may help other commu-nities develop strategies to meet their specific needs.Whatever law enforcement approaches are used in acommunity, the need to evaluate their effectiveness iscritical to furthering knowledge of what works. I. Community Policing Community policing involves police officers and private citizens working together to reduce crime anddisorder and restore community cohesion. The centralfigure in this strategy is the community police officer,whose mission is to maintain direct contact with thecitizens of a small, defined area. This officer serves asliaison between the community and the police. TheDepartment of Justice's Weed and Seed program, forexample, requires that each local site have a commu-nity policing initiative to link the \"weeding out\" ofdrugs and crime with the \"seeding in\" of communityprevention, treatment, and other anti-crime tactics.Community policing has become a popular approachto fighting drug-related crime and bolsters traditionalpolice anti-drug tactics. Policing reforms in the 1920s, while helping to professionalize law enforcement, also distanced thepolice from the community. Government-sponsoredreports on the causes of the urban riots of the 1960sfound that police had lost touch with minority groupresidents, both by changing from foot patrols to carsand by taking a more legalistic approach to lawenforcement. Police were urged to increase their dailycontact with citizens in everyday settings rather than just responding to emergencies. As a result, the com-munity policing model has flourished under thetheory that increasing the quantity and quality ofpolice-citizen contact reduces crime. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforce- ment Act of 1994\u2014popularly known as the \"CrimeAct\"\u2014authorized $8.8 billion over six years for grantsto local policing agencies to add 100,000 officers andto promote community policing in innovative ways.To implement the law, Attorney General Janet Renocreated the Office of Community Oriented PolicingServices (COPS) within the U.S. Department ofJustice to put additional police officers on the streetsusing community policing strategies. For more infor-mation on community policing initiatives, visit theCOPS website at www.usdoj.gov/cops. According to the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Community Policing Consortium's Understand- ing Community Policing: A Framework for Action,community policing consists of two core components:community partnership and problem solving. 80The police become an integral part of community culture,and the community assists in defining future lawenforcement priorities and in allocating resources. InGeorgetown, Texas, for example, the police depart-ment has collaborated with community residents,social service organizations, and city agencies toresolve 80 percent of all illegal drug and alcohol prob-lems they encounter. 81The rise of community coali- tions addressing substance abuse and related crimesince the 1980s has created increased opportunitiesfor citizen and police collaboration. By working with community groups and being more familiar with their concerns and problems,police can be more responsive to the needs and fearsof the community and increase their cultural sensitivi-ty. Publishing drug-related materials and deliveringlaw enforcement messages to immigrant communitiesin their primary (and sometimes only) language canhelp resolve public distrust of the police, which runsdeep in certain locations and cultures. Communityrelations efforts are essential to community policingto forge bonds with community members and legit-imize police efforts. Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising 82 discusses the strong correlation between the perceived legitimacy of policeand citizen willingness to obey the law. Furthermore,Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseLaw Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 51establishing and maintaining mutual trust will give the police greater access to information that can leadto the prevention and solution of crimes. The second component of community policing\u2014problem solving (described in depth under Problem-Oriented Policing)\u2014involves identify-ing neighborhood crime problems, understandingwhy the problems occur, developing and implement-ing long-term solutions, and determining the solu-tions' impact on the problems. The success of community policing has led to innovations in forging partnerships with communitiesto prevent and solve problems. For example, theMidtown Community Court in New York City is thefirst criminal court in the country with on-site socialservices, such as counseling, health care, education,and substance abuse treatment. The sentencingprocess is viewed as an opportunity to solve rootproblems by requiring offenders to perform commu-nity service and providing them with needed socialservices. Court counselors also work with police offi-cers on patrol to identify and find treatment forhomeless individuals and alcoholics and other drugaddicts before their behavior leads to arrest. The following examples demonstrate how com- munity policing is addressing illicit drug and alcohol-related crime in neighborhoods nationwide. Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy, Chicago, Illinois Program Type: Community Policing. Target Audience: All residents of Chicago. Years in Operation: 1993-present. Program Goals: For the police and the community to work together to reduce crime and increase publicsafety.Contact Information: Barbara McDonald, Assistant Deputy Superintendent, Chicago Police Department,312-745-6071. Description: The Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS) has changed the way law enforce-ment agencies in Chicago operate by bringing police,the community, and city agencies together to identifyand solve neighborhood crime problems. During the30 years prior to the program, steady increases inarrests had produced a backlog of court cases. However, crime rates were not dropping, and citizens'fear of crime was increasing. CAPS was created tomake a lasting impact on crime by partnering policewith community groups to solve neighborhood crimeproblems. The strategy began in five of Chicago'spolice districts in April 1993; by the end of 1994 ithad been introduced in the remaining 20 districts. In19 of the 25 districts, community assessments founddrugs to be the main cause of concern among citizens.Since 1993, more than 2,000 new police officers havebeen hired for CAPS. CAPS uses a number of activities to fight crime, including beat meetings, beat officers, and rapidresponse officers. Officers are assigned to one ofChicago's 279 police beats for at least one year, allow-ing them to get to know the community and itsparticular crime problems. The system also permitscommunity members to work directly with their beatofficers to solve crime problems. Teams of rapidresponse officers have been set up to answer many ofthe emergency calls so beat officers have more time towork with residents. The police department has added new technolo- gy to support the CAPS program. A computerizedcrime analysis system called ICAM allows policeofficers to analyze and map crime hot spots andcross-reference the data with information about thecommunity, such as number of bars and sites of aban-doned buildings. Police share the ICAM informationwith the community to increase public safety andawareness. The department has also developed anadvanced 9-1-1 center and increased the use ofcellular phones and pagers to support beat officers. Community members can get involved in CAPS by attending monthly beat meetings, where residentsidentify and prioritize neighborhood crime problemsand discuss ways to solve them. During 1995 and1996, the police department held CAPS orientationprograms throughout the city to increase public aware-ness of the program. The program is also promotedthrough television, posters, signs, and newsletters. CAPS has established a special protocol with a number of city agencies to prioritize requests for ser-vices that have an impact on crime and public safety.By the end of 1995, more than 90 percent of the60,000 requests for city services, including improvedPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 52 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportstreet lighting and trash pick-up, had been responded to. Police officers also help community members trackcourt cases that are of major concern to the commu-nity. Through this process, citizens have created sup-port networks for crime victims and witnesses. The success of CAPS is most striking in the Englewood district. Englewood was chosen as an orig-inal CAPS district because it is a disenfranchisedneighborhood where 99 percent of residents are black,36 percent live below the poverty line, and 31 percentof families are single mother households. In 1993,community residents cited street drug dealing, gangviolence, abandoned buildings, and trash as \"bigproblems\" in their neighborhood. In 1994, after theimplementation of CAPS, the percentage of residentsciting these issues as big problems decreased dramati-cally. Residents citing street drug dealing as a bigproblem decreased from 63 to 49 percent, gang vio-lence from 41 to 35 percent, abandoned buildingsfrom 45 to 28 percent, and trash from 38 percent to24 percent. Challenges: One of the challenges to implement- ing the program was skepticism about a new approach.Police officers felt that they were not able to make animpact on drug-related crime and were not sure that anew policing strategy would make a difference. Oncethe program was implemented, however, officers real-ized that they were able to address some of the largercommunity problems, such as poor coordinationbetween law enforcement and city agencies, rather thanspend all of their time answering emergency calls.Another challenge was getting assistance from the com-munity. The police department spent money on mar-keting to educate citizens about the CAPS program,explain what police needed from them, and help thecommunities set realistic expectations. Costs and Funding Sources: Since this program involved a total restructuring of the Chicago PoliceDepartment, all department funds and resources wentinto the program. The annual budget of the depart-ment is just under $1 billion. Chicago adapted theCAPS program to meet the needs of its police depart-ment without incurring additional costs. A smallercity or town could replicate a similar communitypolicing strategy using existing resources. Program Results: A consortium of four Chicago- area universities\u2014Northwestern, DePaul, Loyola, andthe University of Illinois at Chicago\u2014is conducting an ongoing evaluation of the CAPS program. Theevaluation is being funded by the Illinois CriminalJustice Information Authority, the National Instituteof Justice, and the MacArthur Foundation. The mostrecent evaluation report, published in May 1999,showed promising results. nSince 1996, citizen awareness of CAPS hasgrown from 53 percent to 79 percent; nAttendance at beat community meetingsincreased to 69,700 in 1998 from 59,200 in1995; and nAttendance at beat community meetings ishigher among residents in low-income areas. Although it is impossible to draw a direct link between CAPS and reduction of crime in Chicago,statistics show that crime has decreased dramaticallysince the program was introduced. Since 1992, theyear before CAPS began, violent crime has decreased38 percent, and property crime has decreased 27 per-cent. It is important to note that crime decreased incities nationwide in the 1990s. Weed and Seed, Stowe Village, Hartford, Connecticut Program Type: Community Policing. Target Audience: Residents of Stowe Village, a high drug and crime area in Hartford.Years in Operation: 1995-Present. Program Goals: To work with the community to reduce drugs and crime and increase community leadership.Contact Information: Sergeant Gordon Jones, 860- 527-7300, ext. 5585. For general information onWeed and Seed, contact the Executive Office forWeed and Seed, 202-616-1152,www.ojp.usdoj.gov/eows/. Description: Stowe Village, a public housing development in Hartford with substantial gang anddrug activity, became a Weed and Seed target area in1995. The Weed and Seed program, administered bythe Executive Office for Weed and Seed within theDepartment of Justice, aims to \"weed\" out drugs andcrime in targeted areas and \"seed\" in communityprograms. Currently, over 230 communities areLaw Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 53implementing the Weed and Seed strategy nation- wide. Community policing initiatives are required ateach Weed and Seed site to serve as a link betweenthe police and the community, and have greatly con-tributed to making the Weed and Seed program inStowe Village a success. Community police officers in Hartford, called Community Service Officers (CSOs), are not responsi-ble for responding to emergency calls and can thereforedevote the vast majority of their time to problem solv-ing. The goal of CSOs is to enhance police-communityrelations and to improve citizen satisfaction with thedelivery of police services. Prior to the implementationof Weed and Seed in Hartford, there was only oneCommunity Service Officer assigned to the NortheastNeighborhood, a large area that includes Stowe Village.The new program enabled additional communitypolicing coverage, which resulted in a CSO beingassigned specifically to Stowe Village. The Stowe Village CSO focuses on building bet- ter community relations, organizing communityactivities, and participating in school and communityprograms. For example, in 1996, the CSO helpedorganize an annual police summer youth academy.T wenty-four Stowe Village youths, ages 11 to 13, par-ticipated in the program. They learned what police doon the job and went on field trips with the StoweVillage CSO and two other community officers. TheCSO has also trained residents to become communityleaders through the Building Captain program.Applicants from the 23 apartment buildings in StoweVillage were chosen and trained to serve as BuildingCaptains who report illegal activities to the police andprovide information to residents. The CSO works within the broader enforcement activities supported by Weed and Seed funding. TheHartford Police Department has overall responsibilityfor weeding activities and has utilized a variety ofdepartment resources, including the patrol division,the vice and narcotics division, the CSO unit, themounted patrol unit, and the traffic enforcementunit. The vice and narcotics division conducted aseries of surveillance and undercover buy operations,with the goal of identifying and obtaining warrantson as many drug sellers in Stowe Village as possible.Following this effort, high visibility patrol operationswere implemented, which involves assigning special-ized police units on an as-needed basis. Vehicular barriers were installed to discourage drive-up drug purchases. Weed and Seed tactics also include usingprosecutorial review to target drug sellers and pur-chasers, particularly those with significant seriousfelony records. The success of Stowe Village has prompted the department to use its remaining Weed and Seed fund-ing to target services to the entire NortheastNeighborhood. T wo additional Community ServiceOfficers and two additional patrol units have beenassigned to the neighborhood. Challenges: The biggest challenge to community policing efforts in Stowe Village was overcomingcommunity distrust of police. To address the prob-lem, the Community Service Officer assigned toStowe Village made no arrests within the communityfor two years. Instead, the officer focused on gettingto know the residents, going to community functions,and helping residents access services establishedthrough the seeding process. The officer also workedat the elementary school in Stowe Village, getting toknow the children and their parents. All enforcementwork was left to beat officers in the area. As a result,the community service officer was able to forge posi-tive relationships with area residents. Another constant challenge is getting people involved in community activities and communicatingwith the police. Giving Stowe Village residents anincentive helped overcome the obstacle. BuildingCaptains are given free basic phone service so theycan call the police to report illegal behavior, and theyreceive a $100 rent credit each month. According tothe evaluators of the program, buildings withCaptains are much cleaner and more orderly thanthose without Captains. Although financial incentiveswere required to recruit Building Captains, they are abenefit to the community. Costs and Funding Sources: The Hartford Weed and Seed program was funded through federal grantsfrom the Executive Office for Weed and Seed totaling$1.8 million between fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year1998. In addition, Hartford received nearly $1 mil-lion in asset forfeiture funds from the Department ofJustice. As part of the weeding funds, the departmentreceived between $100,000 and $180,000 annually(totaling over $750,000) to support its enforcementefforts. As of June 2000, the program is funded by54 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportgrant money left over from the first five years. The city plans to apply for new funds when this reserve isdepleted. Program Results: The Hartford site is one of eight included in the National Weed and Seed evalua-tion funded by the National Institute of Justice.According to evaluation data, crime in Stowe Villagedropped 25.9 percent from 1994 to 1995 (the firstyear of Weed and Seed) and an additional 27.1 per-cent from 1995 to 1996. In the area surroundingStowe Village, crime also dropped substantially: 21.4percent and 36.6 percent in the first two years ofWeed and Seed, suggesting that crime was not dis-placed to other areas in the Northeast Neighborhood.Crime rates in Stowe Village continue to remainbelow their original levels. Surveys of Stowe Village residents were conduct- ed as part of the national evaluation. The Institute forSocial Analysis conducted one survey in 1995, andAbt Associates conducted another in 1997. Majorfindings from the two surveys include: nIn 1997, 21 percent of respondents indicatedthat drug use is \"not a problem at all\" or \"asmall problem,\" up from 12 percent in 1995; nIn 1997, 68 percent of respondents indicatedthat the police were doing a \"very good job\" ora \"good job\" of controlling the use and sale ofdrugs, up from 55 percent in 1995; nIn 1997, 79 percent of respondents indicatedthat the police were doing a \"very good job\" ora \"good job\" in responding to communityconcerns, up from 51 percent in 1995; and nIn 1997, 55 percent of respondents indicatedthat Stowe Village had become a better placeto live over the preceding two years, up from45 percent in 1995. II. Problem-Oriented Policing Problem-oriented policing compels officers to think creatively to find solutions to persistent crimeproblems within a community. Problem-orientedpolice are trained to uncover patterns of crime, toidentify solutions, and to find the resources needed to address the problems. The focus shifts away from thelimited perspective offered by crime statistics tobroader questions about the root causes of crime:Why in this location? Why this behavior? Whatimpact is being made on people and the environ-ment? According to Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising , the basic theory behind problem-oriented policing is that the moreaccurately police can identify and minimize causes ofspecific crime patterns, the less crime will exist. 83 In the late 1970s, Herman Goldstein, a University of Washington law professor, published anarticle, \"Improving Policing: A Problem-OrientedApproach,\" in which he asserted that many seeminglyseparate crime incidents actually stemmed from com-mon underlying conditions and were part of a broad-er pattern. 84Under a more traditional model of policing, success might be measured by the number ofarrests made at a drug location; however, using aproblem-solving approach, police measure effective-ness as shutting down the operation. Arrest is onlyone of several strategies, and all strategies are assessedby how effectively drug crime is reduced. If one strat-egy is ineffective, then alternatives are tried. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), in Problem-Oriented Drug Enforcement: A community-based approach for effective policing , defines a problem as something that concerns or causes harm to citizens,not just the police; it is a group or pattern of crimes,cases, calls, or incidents. 85Responding to a problem means more than providing a quick fix; it means deal-ing with the underlying conditions that create theproblem. Problems must be analyzed thoroughly sothat solutions can be specifically tailored to addressthem. According to the Community PolicingConsortium's Community Problem Solving training module (1997), problem solving is best defined by itsparts 86: nIdentifying neighborhood crime problems; nUnderstanding the rise tothese problems; nDeveloping and implementing long-termsolutions tailored to the problems; and nDetermining the solutions' impact on theproblems.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseOne problem-solving model developed by Goldstein and used by various police departments isSARA: Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment.Scanning consists of searching for patterns or persist-ent problems in the community to enable officers tofocus their efforts on concentrations of crime.Identification of crime problems can come from avariety of sources, including officer observations, citi-zens' surveys, community meetings, information fromother agencies, and analysis of crime statistics. Analysis, often the most difficult step in the process, facilitates a greater understanding of the tar-geted problem, which in turn leads to the develop-ment of effective solutions. Questions include: Whatconditions or events precede or accompany the prob-lem? What are the problem's consequences? Howoften does the problem occur? Based on the answersto these and other questions, a hypothesis is formedabout why the problem occurs. For example, if con-venience store robberies are a problem in a particularneighborhood, police might examine what the storesbeing robbed have in common. The next step is todefine a tentative goal, identify resources that may beof assistance in solving the problem, and identifywhat procedures, policies, or rules have been estab-lished to address the problem. Developing a response to the problem involves identifying various solutions and choosing the mostfeasible. Officers decide what needs to be done beforeimplementing the plan and who will be responsiblefor preliminary actions. Stating specific goals of theplan and identifying data sources during the responsephase facilitates the assessment phase, which examinesthe outcomes of the plan and identifies any changesto be made. Using the example of the conveniencestore robberies, if several of the stores had bushes thathid robbers from view, officers might respond by ask-ing the property owner to trim back the hedges. An important element of problem-oriented polic- ing is working with various community groups tosolve problems. Police face two separate challenges:dealing with the immediate situation, and working toestablish long-term community safety. Law enforce-ment is a necessary tool in the short term, but policealso need to help the community identify underlyingproblems and solutions. Some problem-orientedpolice departments have developed resource bookslisting agencies, contact persons, descriptions ofservices, criteria for participation, and costs of ser- vices. Other police departments routinely invite outside agencies to inform officers about services and to offer tips on how to access them. Problem-oriented policing often works in tandem with community policing. A police officer may realizethat drug sales in a certain locale are facilitated by anearby building with lax management, many vacantrooms, and conveniently placed pay phones. Had theneighborhood been equipped with a communitypolicing officer, the building's role in encouragingdrug activity might have been pointed out by neigh-bors long before arrests were necessary. The following programs highlight how law enforcement organizations are effectively usingproblem-oriented policing to address drug-relatedcrime. Landlord Training Program, Portland, Oregon Program Type: Problem-Oriented Policing. Target Audience: Landlords. Years in Operation: 1989-present. Program Goals: To teach landlords how to reduce drug-related problems in rental properties.Contact Information: John Campbell, Campbell Delong Resources, Inc., 503-221-2005. Description: Launched in 1989 by Campbell Delong Resources, the Portland Landlord T rainingProgram has trained over 8,500 landlords to recognizedrug activity in their rental properties. More than 80jurisdictions in 20 states have adopted elements of thePortland program, which has been recognized as anInnovation in State and Local Government by theKennedy School of Government at HarvardUniversity. Developed with input from landlords, attorneys, tenant advocates, and police officers, the programteaches landlords effective property management toreduce drug activity. Landlords learn simple steps theycan take to reduce drugs and crime on their property.Police teach landlords how to screen rental applicants,make their property less conducive to crime, create afeeling of community within their buildings, andwork with police officers to solve problems. The needfor the program is great; an average of 27 percent of An OJP Issues & Practices Report 55Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 5556 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 56 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportlandlords attending the training between 1989 and 1992 reported recent drug activity on their property. There are three main components to the pro- gram: a training manual, marketing and outreach,and the training itself. The training manual isdesigned to be user-friendly and can be adapted toreflect tenant/landlord laws in specific communities.Marketing and outreach is critical; the more landlordstrained, the greater the benefit to the community. ThePortland Chief of Police sent letters to landlords inhigh-crime neighborhoods, attracting over 7,000landlords to the program between 1989 and 1995.Word of mouth and local media attention are alsoimportant marketing tools. A manual for police officers interested in starting a similar program is available through CampbellDelong Resources, Inc. (see contact informationabove). The guide discusses important implementa-tion issues, including finding competent staff, devel-oping a local training manual, and designing andmarketing the training. Successful program replicationrequires six basic elements: an appropriate trainer, aprogram tailored to the needs of the community, acomplete understanding of landlords' needs and con-cerns, partnerships with both tenant and landlordadvocates, a focus on immediate solutions to illegalactivity (as opposed to discussing how laws should bechanged), and effective marketing. Challenges: One of the major challenges to implementing the program was defining the roles ofthe people involved. Landlords initially felt that anycriminal activity taking place on their property wasthe responsibility of the police and were reluctant toget involved. When landlords learned that they wereresponsible for crime on their property and that theycould take action against problem tenants, they werewilling to partner with police. Costs and Funding Sources: Initially, the pro- gram was funded through a grant from the Bureau ofJustice Assistance. The program is now funded by thecity's Office of Planning and Development Review. Itis estimated that each training session costs approxi-mately $1,300, which includes logistics and trainertime. Program marketing is an additional cost. The Landlord T raining Program is designed to be replicated, and communities seeking to implementtheir own programs have many options. Large cities often want to tailor the national manual to their ownneeds and policies, which can take up to six monthsand requires a full-time staff person. Large cities alsoneed a part-time program director and multiple train-ers. Fifteen to 20 training sessions are conducted dur-ing the first two years, with approximately five held ineach of the following years. Programmers in smallcities can order the national manual and participate instate or national training sessions. Small cities usuallyconduct one or two training sessions per year.Landlord training programs are often funded by theOffice of Community Oriented Policing Serviceswithin the Department of Justice. Program Results: In 1992, Campbell Delong Resources conducted a follow-up study of the 1,512landlords who attended the program in 1991. Thesurvey found that 91 percent of the landlordschanged the way they managed their property afterthe training. The most common actions taken by thelandlords were: nMore frequent and careful inspections of theproperty (71 percent) (they visited the sitemore often and were more aware of what signsof drug activity to look for); nImprovements to the visibility of the property,such as trimming back overgrown hedges (71percent); and nPurchasing updated rental forms to match thecurrent landlord tenant law. The survey also found that 220 landlords had to deal with drug problems on their property after thetraining; 95 percent of them said that what theylearned in the training helped them address the prob-lems. Results of post-training questionnaires given tothe 3,335 landlords who attended training sessionsbetween 1989 and 1993 indicate that the programwas useful: n78 percent of the landlords said that theywould definitely change the way they managetheir property as a result of the training; and n80 percent of the landlords felt that the train-ing was worthwhile.Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 57An OJP Issues & Practices Report 57Mario's Market, Delray Beach, Florida Program Type: Problem-Oriented Policing. Target Audience: Drug buyers and sellers and other perpetrators of crime in the vicinity of Mario'sMarket.Years in Operation: 1993-1995. Program Goals: To work with the community to solve drug and crime problems at Mario's Market,a local convenience store, and the surrounding area.Contact Information: Sergeant Javaro Sims, Delray Beach Police Department, 561-243-7888. Description: T wo community police officers working in an eight-man foot patrol in Delray Beach,Florida, recognized that Mario's Market, a local con-venience store, was generating a substantial number ofservice calls and criminal activity in the area. The offi-cers, utilizing a problem-oriented policing approach,examined the store and the surrounding area to iden-tify contributors to illegal activity. Contributing fac-tors included the layout of the property (the marketwas open on all sides, and a T-shaped alley in backprovided easy entry and escape for buyers and sellersof drugs), poor lighting, and a drug house locatedbehind the store. Upon completion of the assessment, the two offi- cers invited the other officers on their beat, the chiefof police, the local fire chief, the property owners andproprietors, and supervisors from other public agen-cies to a meeting to discuss possible solutions to theproblem. The officers presented an itemized list ofwhat they wanted to accomplish at Mario's Marketand what assistance they required. Before beginningtheir work, the officers knew they needed communitycooperation, which they got by appealing to commu-nity leaders early in the process. The officers employed a wide variety of tactics to solve the problem at Mario's Market. They started anuisance abatement case against the owners of thedrug house, and the dealers were eventually evicted.The officers put up a chain-link fence to deter deal-ers, and barriers to stop cars from entering and exitingthe alley. They installed a fake video camera (donatedby a local TV-repair company), and enlisted the helpof probationers on community-service detail to fix upthe parking lot. Delineating parking spaces helpedeliminate the drive-through nature of the drug market,and establishing handicap parking spaces in the front of the store meant drug buyers were subject to a $240fine if they parked there. Challenges: A major challenge in Delray Beach was bridging the gap between the community and thepolice. The store proprietors were hesitant to help thepolice because they were afraid of retaliation from thedrug dealers. When the police increased their presencein the area, the proprietors' fear was alleviated andthey cooperated with police. To further engage theproprietors, the police painted the store to make itmore attractive. Enhancing the store's appearanceattracted more law-abiding customers. A second challenge was enlisting the help of city departments and private organizations. Officers per-sonally met with supervisors of specified agencies andexplained what they wanted to do and how it wouldbenefit the community. This approach, in addition tothe initial meeting with community leaders, broughtpeople on board to assist the officers. One privateorganization, Florida Power and Light, agreed toinstall bullet-resistant lights on the property for free.The owners pay $18 a month for each light to coverthe additional electric costs. Costs and Funding Sources: Police overtime costs were the largest community expenditure. Mostof the materials the officers used to enhance the prop-erty were donated by community organizations. Inaddition, the increased police involvement encour-aged the owners of the property to spend their ownmoney on renovation. Program Results: The officers' work contributed to a reduction in calls for service on the block frommore than 100 in 1994 to fewer than ten in 1995.Additionally, there were no robberies on the propertyin 1995. The project helped institutionalize problem-oriented policing in the area by proving to both thecommunity members and law enforcement officersthat resources can be effectively pooled to solve specif-ic neighborhood crime problems. III. Reducing Drug Availability Drug problems vary widely among cities, towns, and neighborhoods. As a result, anti-drug tactics usedby local law enforcement agencies differ depending oncommunity need. According to the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), there are over 17,000 stateand local law enforcement agencies engaged in almost160 different anti-drug tactics. PERF's 1996 report,Police Antidrug T actics: New Approaches and Applica-tions, lists a wide range of activities, including police observation of drug sales in plain view, directedpatrols that concentrate police presence in areas ofheavy drug activity, undercover operations, regulatorycode enforcement, community-based programs, andanti-drug efforts targeting locations, individuals, andevents. Police have long known that there are \"hot spots\" in many communities that generate a large number ofcalls for service. Research confirms this view. It is esti-mated that 10 percent of locations generate about 60percent of crimes. 87The presence of uniformed offi- cers at these locations tends to deter the activities ofwould-be offenders; it also guarantees immediateresponse to problems. By concentrating law enforce-ment resources in specific locations for several hours aday, hot spot strategies disrupt retail drug sales with-out necessarily increasing arrests. Charleston, SouthCarolina, has adopted a hot spot strategy thatincludes stationing police at the busiest drug marketsand photographing drug buyers. Police can reducedrug transactions by increasing the risk to buyers andsellers. A federally administered program designed to address hot spots of drug activity is the High IntensityDrug T rafficking Area (HIDTA) program. The Officeof National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) directsfunds to areas within the United States which exhibitserious drug trafficking problems. Law enforcementorganizations within HIDTAs assess these problemsand design specific initiatives to reduce or eliminatethe production, manufacture, transportation, distribu-tion, and chronic use of illegal drugs. Since 1990,31 areas within the country have been designated asHIDTAs. The key priorities of the program are toassess regional drug threats; develop and fund effortsthat combat drug trafficking threats; facilitate coordi-nation among federal, state and local efforts; andimprove the effectiveness of drug control efforts toreduce or eliminate the harmful impact of drugtrafficking. Effectively enforcing local regulatory codes can reduce drug activity. Nuisance abatement programs,Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse for example, target rental properties that are hot spots of drug activity. Police threaten court action to seizeproperty unless owners take action to curtail drugdealing. In Oakland, California, a nuisance abatementproject has produced significant reductions in arrests,field contacts, and citizen calls. Another local effort that reduces drug activity in high crime areas, particularly when used as an ancil-lary activity to increased police crackdowns, is alteringtraffic patterns. By changing the flow of traffic, policecan make it difficult for drug dealers to use routesthat permit easy access to drive-by purchases. Streetclosures used in a Los Angeles neighborhood with ahigh level of drug activity and shootings reducedhomicides by 65 percent. 88 Technological advances in law enforcement enhance police ability to identify hot spots of drugactivity. The National Institute of Justice's DrugMarket Analysis Project (DMAP), for example, usescomputer technology to map drug activity, whichimproves police departments' ability to analyze theircrime and drug problems. One DMAP experiment inJersey City, New Jersey, found consistent and strongeffects on emergency calls for service in the targetedarea with little displacement of drug activity to thesurrounding area. The data, presented in Policing Drug Hot Spots, suggests that the benefits of tighter control also spread to areas around the hot spots. 89 Forming task forces to combat high rates of drug- related crime is a popular option for many communi-ties, often in concert with the federal government. TheDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) administersseveral programs designed to help localities addressdrugs and crime. The Mobile Enforcement Team(MET) program, created by DEA in 1995, is designedto help local law enforcement combat violent drugorganizations in their neighborhoods. Over 200deployments have been completed nationwide. DEAalso supports the State and Local Task Force Program,which provides a federal presence in sparsely populatedareas. Such programs combine federal funds andexpertise with local officers' investigative talents anddetailed knowledge of their own jurisdictions. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Program is another federal program that hasbeen working with local law enforcement agenciesfighting major drug trafficking organizations since 58 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportdesigned to rid prisons of illicit drugs by combining interdiction methods, drug testing, and drug treat-ment. In 1997, the Pennsylvania Department ofCorrections opened the state's first substance abusetreatment prison. All offenders entering the Pennsylvania prison system undergo a substance abuse assessment; onaverage, 92 percent of inmates are identified as need-ing treatment. All of Pennsylvania's 24 prisons offerdrug treatment, and seven have therapeutic commu-nities. The prisons also have highly sensitive drugdetection equipment that can identify drugs smuggledin by visitors, personnel, or through the mail. In1998, 734 of the 22,074 visitors were found to bepossessing drugs. A new phone system allows staff torandomly monitor inmates' conversations for evidenceof drug smuggling or use. Drug-sniffing dogs searchcells for evidence of drugs or weapons. In 1998 thedogs were responsible for 137 drug and 23 weaponconfiscations. Using software developed by the department, corrections officers randomly select inmates to be test-ed for drugs each day. Those who test positive facemandatory punishment and must undergo drug treat-ment. Corrections officers also conduct drug tests onprisoners in treatment or with previous disciplinaryproblems. Both urinalysis (which detects drug use inthe previous 48-hours) and hair analysis (which candetect use in the previous three months) are used. In1999, Pennsylvania correctional officers conducted148,444 random and targeted drug tests. In additionto selecting prisoners for testing, the software alsoserves as a database to track the results of all drugtests. Challenges: One of the greatest challenges to implementing the Drug Interdiction Program wastraining prison staff in how to use the new computersoftware. Although all corrections staff knew how totest inmates for drugs, many did not have a great dealof experience with computers and all were unfamiliarwith the new software. To educate prison staff, thedepartment held two statewide training sessions. Costs and Funding Sources: All components of the program are funded through the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Corrections. In 1999, the total cost ofthe program was $500,140 which covered staffsalaries and operating costs. Start-up expenses for the1982. Nine federal agencies participate in the pro- gram, including the DEA, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service, theU.S. Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms. State and local law enforce-ment officers can be deputized as federal officers forthe duration of a task force investigation, and localagencies are eligible for reimbursement for certainexpenses incurred during the program. Anotheroption for states and localities is the FBI Safe StreetsGang Task Force, which addresses gang-related vio-lence and drug trafficking by initiating investigationsof violent street gangs; for example, the New OrleansGang Task Force increased the percentage of murdercases solved in the city from 58 percent in 1998 to 65percent in 1999. Along with domestic anti-drug tactics, interna- tional efforts target illegal drugs entering the country.These efforts include cooperative efforts with othernations in building their institutions, attacking illegaldrug production, interdicting drug shipments in bothsource and transit countries, and dismantling multina-tional drug trafficking organizations. Technologicaladvances are key to reducing drug flow into the coun-try. For example, the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy is examining the use of computer mapping tostudy how drugs flow from source countries. The following are examples of how community law enforcement efforts are successfully reducing theavailability of illicit drugs. Drug Interdiction Program, the State of Pennsylvania Program Type: Reducing Drug Availability. Target Audience: Prison inmates using illicit drugs. Years in Operation: 1996-present. Program Goals: To reduce drug use among prison inmates and enhance inmate and staff safety.Contact Information: Major Daniel Nagy, Chief of Security, Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections,717-730-5012. Description: In response to increases in drug overdoses and violence among inmates, the DrugInterdiction Program was implemented in allPennsylvania prisons in 1996. The program, launchedby the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, is An OJP Issues & Practices Report 59Law EnforcementContact Information: Drug Enforcement tion, Office of Domestic Operations, MobileEnforcement Section, 202-307-8799. Description: The Mobile Enforcement Team (MET) program was implemented in 1995 inresponse to increased drug-related violent crime inlocal communities. At the request of local lawenforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA) deploys special agents to work hand-in-handwith local law enforcement to identify major sourcesof drug-related crime; to collect, analyze, and sharedata; to cultivate investigations; to arrest offenders; toseize assets; and to support state, local, and federalprosecutors. Key West, Florida, is one of over 200MET deployment sites implemented nationwide sincethe DEA developed the program. The Key West MET deployment, which lasted from June 1999 to December 1999, was requested bythe chief of police. The Key West Police Departmentwas having difficulty infiltrating drug trafficking net-works due to limited staff, lack of financial resources,and the \"closeness\" of the community, which made itdifficult for police officers to work undercover. A vio-lent group of drug traffickers formed an alliance(known as TROCHE/ALSTON) to control the crackand heroin market in the Bahama Village section ofKey West. The Miami MET used technical equipment, sur- veillance tactics and undercover penetration to gatherevidence on members of the TROCHE/ALSTONorganizations. The tactics led to the indictment of 65drug distributors and helped MET uncover the pri-mary sources of crack cocaine. A total of 56 officersfrom the DEA, U.S. Customs Service, and the KeyWest Police Department took part in the operation. The project concluded on December 9, 1999, with the arrest of 65 individuals and the seizure ofapproximately four kilograms of cocaine, three kilo-grams of crack cocaine, 20 pounds of marijuana, sev-en ounces of heroin, 50 LSD tablets, and 50 ecstasytablets. In addition, approximately $70,000 infirearms were seized. The drug operation had beenthe largest ever in Key West, which is renowned forits long history of drug smuggling.program would vary depending on how comprehen- sively the program is replicated and might includecosts for drug screening equipment, phone equip-ment, and computer equipment. Program Results: The National Institute of Justice evaluated the interdiction program in five pris-ons representing a cross-section of all prisons in thestate and including both male and female inmates. 90 Urinalysis and hair tests were conducted on 917inmates in 1996, prior to implementation of the pro-gram; 1,031 inmates were tested in 1998. Tests wereconducted only on inmates who had been in prisonfor at least three months to ensure that any indicateddrug use occurred after entering prison. Results of theevaluation showed a dramatic reduction in drug use. nPositive hair tests for marijuana dropped from9.3 percent to 0.8 percent, tests positive forcocaine dropped from 2.3 percent to 1.2 per-cent, and tests positive for opiates droppedfrom 0.8 percent to 0.6 percent. Hair testspositive for any drug dropped from 10.6 per-cent to 2.3 percent. nPositive urinalysis tests for marijuana droppedfrom 2.0 percent to 1.6 percent; cocainedropped from 0.1 percent to zero, and opiatesrose slightly, from 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent.Positive urinalysis tests for any drug droppedfrom 3.4 percent to 2.2 percent. In addition to decreasing drug use in the prisons, violence declined as well. The department found thatinmate-on-inmate assaults dropped 20.2 percentbetween 1995 and 1998 (from 534 to 426). Inmate-on-staff assaults decreased 20.8 percent during thesame time period, from 869 to 688. Mobile Enforcement Team (MET) Deployment, Key West, Florida Program Type: Reducing Drug Availability.

Program Goals: Deploy MET Special Agents nation- wide to combat violent drug crimes and drug-relatedgang activity.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 60 An OJP Issues & Practices Report60 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportLaw Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 61Challenges: One of the challenges for communi- ties requesting MET assistance, including Key West,is the lack of state and local manpower and fundingto fight violent drug traffickers on their own. In someinstances the community is so small that local policeare well-known and undercover tactics, such as sur-veillance, cannot be used. DEA meets these challengesthrough the MET program. Costs and Funding Sources: For fiscal year 2000, Congress appropriated $8 million to DEA foroperation of the MET program. Outcomes Measures: DEA agencies track the results of MET operations. As of April 30, 2000, the262 MET deployments had achieved the followingresults: $14,984,433 Arrests: 10,128 (includes 52 arrests for murder) Recently, with financial assistance from the Bureau of Justice Assistance and technical assistancefrom the National Crime Prevention Council, theDEA piloted MET-II, which provides training incommunity mobilization and drug demand reductionto leaders from MET communities. In fiscal year1999 there were three regional training sessionsinvolving 40 MET communities in 23 states. Eachcommunity sent a team of up to five individuals thatincluded elected officials, judges, law enforcementofficers, city and school administrators, communityactivists, and representatives of the business and faithcommunities. The purpose of the training sessions is to prevent a re-emergence of drug-related violent crime in the targetcommunities. The training stresses the importance of asystemwide approach to preventing drug use and traf-ficking, encourages community leaders to committhemselves to implementing strategies that enhancepublic safety, and equips leaders to fulfill these commit-ments by teaching them techniques for planning,organizing, and evaluating prevention programs.According to surveys of participants after the training sessions, 89 percent stated that they were sat-isfied with the workshops and benefitted from them.At least four MET-II training sessions were plannedfor 2000. North Hills Block Project, Citywide Nuisance Abatement Program, LosAngeles, California Program Type: Reducing Drug Availability. Target Audience: Residents of North Hills, a neighbor- hood with severe drug-related crime problems.Years in Operation: 1997-2000. Program Goals: Reduce drug-related crime problems in North Hills and increase quality of life among residents.Contact Information: Mary Clare Molidor, Assistant City Attorney, Director of Nuisance Abatement,310-575-8552. Description: Launched in early 1997, the Citywide Nuisance Abatement Program (CNAP) isa multiagency task force that targets Los Angelesneighborhoods with histories of pervasive narcoticsactivity. Participating agencies include the Los AngelesPolice Department, City Attorney's Office, HousingDepartment, Department of Building and Safety, andPlanning Department. CNAP's Neighborhood BlockProjects combine enforcement, enhancement, andoutreach efforts to revitalize communities. The NorthHills Block Project covers the portion of the SanFernando Valley once considered by police as themost concentrated area of narcotics sales in the cityof Los Angeles. The first step in the North Hills Block Project was to conduct a needs assessment survey in whichresidents identified drug and gang activity as the com-munity's most urgent problems. CNAP's enforcementteam in North Hills was created using a multiagencyapproach to community policing, and included repre-sentatives from city, county, state, and federal agen-cies. In order to reduce flagrant street sales ofnarcotics in the area, officers conducted numerousearly morning buy/bust and reverse or sting opera-tions. A prosecutor from the city attorney's officeworked closely with local narcotics detectives toensure that narcotics arrests were reviewed, and totrain the officers regarding new drug-related laws. In An OJP Issues & Practices Report 61Another challenge is familiarizing prosecution and police personnel with using civil remedies, suchas abatement, to respond to criminal acts. It is criticalto get a commitment from local prosecutors to usecivil abatement remedies and from the police depart-ment to train officers on how to use abatement. Costs and Funding Sources: The CNAP pro- gram, including all of the integrated services and per-sonnel from various agencies, costs approximately $9million annually. The core nuisance abatement pro-gram costs $3.8 million. Although the budget is quitelarge, program staff say smaller municipalities canoperate a similar program for much less money bytapping into already existing governmental and pri-vate resources. A critical cost is money to hire a com-munity resource specialist, at an average cost of$50,000 to $60,000 per year. These specialists workwithin a particular neighborhood to combineresources and act as a liaison between residents, busi-nesses, governmental agencies, and other interestedparties. The North Hills specialist has a backgroundin grassroots community organizing and is responsiblefor door-to-door surveys, meeting planning and set-up, and keeping participants in the communityimpact team on task. CNAP activities are funded bythe City of Los Angeles' General Fund. In addition,the city directs funds from federal block grants to theproject, including the Edward Byrne Formula GrantProgram and the Community Development BlockGrant. Program Results: The success of the North Hills Block Project is being measured by progress in bothenforcement of the laws and enhancement of thecommunity. Enforcement: nCrime statistics show crimes (robbery, burgla- ry, rape, assault, and grand theft auto) in theBlock Project Area from July throughSeptember of 1999 were 27 percent lowerthan for the same three-month period in1997, just prior to the beginning of the proj-ect (186 crimes compared to 254 crimes); nGang-related crime in the Devonshire area(most of which originates in the North Hillsarea) decreased 39 percent from February1999 to February 2000; andaddition to undercover operations, prosecutors, narcotics officers, and code inspectors employed site-specific narcotics abatement strategies. A gang abate-ment lawsuit was filed which led to an injunctionagainst 24 street gang members named in the lawsuit. The enhancement team in North Hills formed a community impact team (CIT) broken down intofive subcommittees: the North Hills BusinessOrganizing Committee, the Neighborhood WatchCommittee, the Community Outreach Committee,the Sepulveda Park West Committee, and the NorthHills Beautification Committee. A public park forneighborhood soccer leagues is being built, streetsand alleys have been re-paved, increased street lightingplans have been proposed, a plan to divert drug-related traffic from the area has been successfullyimplemented, and residents have access to a publishedlist of city resources and community contacts. Results from the community needs assessment identified a lack of communication among communi-ty groups already operating in North Hills. CNAP'soutreach team worked to bring these organizationstogether to respond to community needs. A monthlycalendar of events was developed, which was translat-ed to serve the predominantly Spanish-speaking com-munity. CIT members publicized local events andtrained new leaders in the community. As a result,Familias Unidas, a nonprofit, community-basedorganization, was formed in the project area to servefamilies. Currently, CNAP is preparing to expand the pro- gram into other neighborhoods. However, personnelwill remain available to assist local law enforcementand community members. For example, abatementprosecutors will continue to handle site-specific nar-cotics abatement, and a community resource specialistwill be available for residents and agencies seekingassistance. In addition, CNAP will include NorthHills in its Kid Watch L.A. Program, which focuseson ensuring the safe transit of school childrenthrough high crime areas using local neighborhoodvolunteers. Challenges: The major challenge to implement- ing CNAP was in organizing agencies that had neverworked together before and were unfamiliar with oneanother's goals and responsibilities. CNAP resolvedthis problem by creating the Community ImpactTeam (CIT).Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 62 An OJP Issues & Practices Report62 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportcontrol of their own recovery and to hold them accountable for failure to comply with treatment. Communities often create alternatives to incar- ceration programs by determining their specific needs.What types of cases are most prevalent? Whichoffenders return to the system repeatedly? Some programs target first-time offenders, while others con-centrate on repeat offenders. Programs can serve offenders who may not have committed a drug offense but have an addictionproblem. Program developers must consider whattreatment strategies, incentives, and sanctions will bemost effective for the types of offenders that the pro-gram targets. Alternative to incarceration programs differ depending on the stage in the justice system wherethe intervention occurs. Different models include: 93 nDiversion/deferred prosecution model \u2014for first-time offenders who enter the programprior to prosecution. Charges may be reducedor dropped altogether if participants meet therequirements of the program; nPlea model \u2014before entering the program, defendants enter a guilty plea which can bestricken from their record upon successfulcompletion of the program; nPost-adjudication \u2014used mainly for repeat offenders who face increasingly severe penal-ties. While prosecutors may be unwilling todefer prosecution for these offenders, they willconsider more lenient sentencing if partici-pants plead guilty and undergo treatment pri-or to sentencing; and nCombination model \u2014used by programs that handle many different types of cases, includingfirst-time and habitual offenders. Such pro-grams often use different models to meet theneeds of a particular case. One innovative alternative to incarceration is drug court. Drug courts place nonviolent, drug-abusing offenders into intensive court-supervisedtreatment instead of prison. Instead of a traditionaladversarial courtroom scenario (the defense versus theprosecution), everyone works together to develop apositive outcome for the offender. Judges interactnOver 40 separate locations were investigatedfor nuisance abatement during the project;only three remain open, and investigations ofthese locations are still pending. According to a survey of area residents one year after implementation of the North Hills BlockProject, the enforcement activity improved the life ofthe community. For the first time in years, peoplecould walk to the grocery store without beingapproached by gang members or drug dealers. Enhancement: nIn 1999 the percentage of school children re- enrolling for the next term at a North Hillselementary school was nearly 60 percent, upfrom 30 percent in 1997; and nThe vacancy rate in area apartment complexesdropped from 50 percent in 1997 to 5 percentin 1999. IV. Alternatives to Incarceration Drug offenses are the primary cause of case over- load in all parts of the criminal justice system. Thirtypercent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federalprisoners are sentenced for drug law violations. Atleast half of drug offenders sentenced to probation instate courts are rearrested for felony offenses withinthree years; a third are rearrested for drug offenses. 91 Drug-abusing offenders are more likely than othercriminals to become repeat offenders. Fifty-one per-cent of parolees who abuse drugs, regardless of theiroffense, return to prison within three years of release,compared to 40 percent of all parolees. 92 Alternatives to incarceration are designed to stop the revolving door of drug abuse and crime byusing the coercive power of the court to engage drug-abusing offenders in treatment. The criminal justiceand substance abuse treatment systems work togetherto provide offenders with the services they need whilestill holding them accountable for their crimes.Compliance with alternatives to incarceration pro-grams is generally based on measurable performancegoals, such as completion of treatment phases andabstinence. Programs often provide clear choices,sanctions, and incentives to help individuals take An OJP Issues & Practices Report 63Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 63the drug treatment community. Some drug offenders are diverted out of the criminal justice system andinto community-based supervision, others receivetreatment as part of probation, and still others enterinto transitional services when they leave a correction-al institution. All treatment and rehabilitation servicesare provided in concert with criminal justice sanc-tions. There are over 200 TASC programs operatingthroughout the United States. Many communities are using alternatives to incarceration to break the cycle of drug abuse andcrime. The following examples highlight several ofthese efforts. Alternative Incarceration Program, the State of Connecticut Program Type: Alternatives to Incarceration. Target Audience: All offenders who are not a threat to the community, including many drug offenders.Years in Operation: 1990-present. Program Goals: Provide alternatives to incarcerating offenders while protecting the safety of the community.Contact Information: William Carbone, Director, Court Support Services Division, 860-563-1332. Description: Connecticut's Alternative Incarceration Program (AIP), begun in 1990, provides alternativesto incarceration for offenders who are not considereddangerous to society. The program was initiated inresponse to Connecticut's skyrocketing prison con-struction expenditures; between 1985 and 1990, thestate spent over $1 billion building prisons. In 1990the newly created Office of Alternative Sanctions(OAS) (now the Court Support Services Division ofthe State Judicial Branch) was assigned the task of cre-ating alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offend-ers. As of 1999, 165,280 offenders had beenprocessed through AIP . The program's capacity isapproximately 4,500 adult and 700 juvenile offendersat any one time. The Alternative Incarceration Program was designed to give judges an array of alternatives toincarceration when sentencing an offender. Judges canchoose from eight programs that provide various ser-vices, including substance abuse treatment. Offendersare sentenced to programs depending on the circum-stances and the severity of their crime. Individualcontinually with participants, increasing offender accountability. Extensive studies show that, on aver-age, drug courts reduce recidivism by two-thirdsamong those who \"graduate,\" requiring a fraction ofthe cost of incarceration. 94The first drug court began in Miami in 1989, and as of June 2000, 440 drugcourts have been implemented nationwide and anadditional 279 are in the planning stages. Informationon drug court programs nationwide can be found onthe Drug Courts Program Office website atwww.ojp.usdoj.gov/dcpo/. The National Association of Drug Court Professionals has developed a manual explaining theten key elements of successful drug courts 95: nIntegrate alcohol and drug treatment serviceswith justice system case processing; nUse a nonadversarial approach in which prose-cution and promote publicsafety while protecting participants' dueprocess rights; nIdentify eligible participants early for immedi-ate referral the program; nProvide access to a continuum of treatmentand rehabilitation services; nMonitor abstinence by frequent drug testing; nCoordinate court and treatment responses tocompliance or lack of compliance, includingcontingency contracts that involve participantsin their own sanctions and incentives; nRequire ongoing judicial interaction with drugcourt participants; nMonitor and evaluate achievement of programgoals and program effectiveness; nPromote effective programs through interdisci-plinary education of planning teams; and nForge partnerships among drug courts, publicagencies, and community-based organizations. Another program that employs the coercive pow- er of the criminal justice system to get individualsinto treatment is TASC, T reatment Accountability forSafer Communities. TASC, created in the 1970s bythe Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, pro-vides a bridge between the criminal justice system andPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 64 An OJP Issues & Practices Report64 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportnCost saving: The average annual cost for an offender in the program is $7,000 per year, ver-sus $25,000 for incarceration. In 1998 it wasestimated that it would have cost $525 millionin prison construction costs and an additional$94 million in operating costs to imprison the150,000 offenders in the program. A three-year longitudinal study by the Justice Education Center, Inc. completed in 1996, foundthat program participants were less likely to commitcrimes than offenders who had been in prison. nThree years after release, offenders in aDepartment of Corrections comparison groupwere rearrested for drug offenses at three timesthe rate of AIP participants. nThree years after release, there were two felonyarrests of program clients for every threeamong the comparison group. Multnomah County S.T.O.P. Drug Diversion Program, Multnomah County,Oregon Program Type: Alternatives to Incarceration. Target Audience: People charged with their first drug offense.Years in Operation: 1991-present. Program Goals: To reduce recidivism and substance abuse among drug offenders through a treatment andsanctions program.Contact Information: Opportunity-Progress (STOP) Drug DiversionProgram was launched in 1991 to reduce the backlogof cases in the Multnomah County court system andto provide needed treatment for first-time drugoffenders. The program serves between 400 and 500clients per year. Since the program began, 1,750 peo-ple have graduated, and 65 drug-free babies have beenborn to program clients. To be eligible for STOP , offenders must be charged with drug possession and cannot have anymanufacturing or distribution charges. Defendantschoose to participate in the program and can with-draw within the first 14 days with no penalty. Beforeservices are provided by over 100 private, nonprofit organizations throughout the state. Offenders enter AIP at either the pretrial or post- conviction stage of criminal processing. Offendersheld in pretrial detention are assessed by bail commis-sioners who, based on the needs of the offenders andtheir likelihood of rearrest, recommend an appropri-ate alternative sanction program to the judge.Offenders entering the program at the postconvictionstage are assessed by probation officers who workdirectly with individual AIPs to ensure that offendersare channeled to appropriate programs. The officersalso help guide judges in offender placement. Comm-unity safety is considered each time an offender is rec-ommended for a program. Offenders successfully completing AIP , which can last from four months to two years, do not serveprison time. However, offenders who are dismissedfrom the program for any reason must complete theirprison sentence. Challenges: Connecticut faced many obstacles in implementing AIP . The program had to overcomepublic fear of placing offenders in the community.Careful placement of offenders in programs with theappropriate amount of supervision, along with thelow recidivism rates of program participants, helpedalleviate these fears. Another problem was that manycommunities did not want an AIP program housed intheir neighborhood. The state overcame this byrequiring offenders to complete community servicehours in the neighborhood where their program waslocated. In 1996 alone, more than 7,000 offendersparticipated in community service projects, providing250,000 hours of work valued at $1.3 million. Costs and Funding Sources: The 2000 budget for the program is $55 million, $30 million of whichis for adult programs and $25 million for juveniles.All of the funds are provided by the state. Program Results: Connecticut's Alternative Incarceration Program has proven successful on manylevels. The legislation establishing the programincluded a five-year \"sunset clause\" stating that anumber of goals had to be met or the program wouldbe canceled. In 1994, based on the positive results ofthe program, the legislature unanimously passed a billto continue AIP indefinitely with no further sunsetclauses.Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 65An OJP Issues & Practices Report 65Department of Community Corrections by the Northwest Professional Consortium. The evaluationexamined arrests of STOP participants within twoyears after leaving the program and compared themwith arrests of offenders who were eligible for the pro-gram but did not participate. The evaluation foundthat program participants had fewer arrests than non-participants and that the amount of time spent in theprogram had a positive effect on arrest rates. T woyears after leaving the program: nProgram participants (graduates and nongrad-uates) had 61 percent fewer total arrests thanthe comparison group; program graduates had76 percent fewer arrests than the comparisongroup. nProgram participants (graduates and nongrad-uates) had 64 percent fewer felony arrests thanthe comparison group; graduates had 80 per-cent fewer felony arrests than the comparisongroup clients. nProgram participants (graduates and nongrad-uates) had 72 percent fewer drug arrests thanthe comparison group; program graduates had85 percent fewer drug-related arrests than thecomparison group. It was estimated that STOP saved Oregon tax- payers $23,235 in avoided costs per program partici-pant in the first two years after completing the program. The majority of cost savings are to theMultnomah County Criminal Justice System at$5,629 per client. Drug Treatment Alternative-to-Prison, Brooklyn, New York Program Type: Alternatives to Incarceration. Target Audience: Criminal offenders with substance abuse problems.Years in Operation: 1990-present. Program Goals: To divert drug-using criminal offend- ers to treatment while protecting community safety.Contact Information: Anne Swern, Deputy District Attorney, 718-250-3939. Description: In 1990, Brooklyn became the first community in the country to have a prosecutorialprogram providing alternatives to incarceration forentering the program, offenders agree to give up their right to contest the charges against them. If they failthe treatment program, their cases are tried solely onthe police reports which shortens case processing timeto less than one minute. Charges are dropped for alloffenders who successfully complete STOP . Approxi-mately 46 percent of the offenders who enter the pro-gram graduate. Substance abuse treatment is provided by InAct Inc., a private agency. At the beginning of the pro-gram clients are required to attend group and individ-ual therapy each weekday and later once or twice perweek. Clients also go to court once a month and aregiven random urinalysis tests. The frequency of uri-nalysis and drug court appearances depend on howwell the client is doing in treatment; clients who arehaving problems are tested and appear in court morefrequently than those who have clean drug screeningsand are doing well in treatment. InAct Inc. also offerseducational and employment services and treatmentfor clients with mental health problems. Offenderswho do not comply with the treatment program aresanctioned with jail time or work camp. Clients areusually enrolled in the program between one year to18 months. Challenges: One of the challenges to implement- ing the Portland program, which is common amongdrug courts, was deciding whether the judge or thetreatment provider would have the authority to termi-nate clients from the program. A consensus wasreached in Portland that the judge should have thisauthority because the offenders, while involved intreatment, are under the jurisdiction of the criminaljustice system. Resolving that issue enabled the courtand the treatment providers to work together to bestserve the clients. Costs and Funding Sources: The annual budget of STOP averages $1.2 million and covers only thecost of treatment. There are no costs for salariesbecause duties of probation officers, district attorneys,the drug court judge, and staff are recalculated toinclude the drug court. Funding for STOP comesfrom a federal block grant and through the CountyDepartment of Community Justice. Program Results: An evaluation of STOP , pub- lished in 1998, was funded by the State JusticeInstitute and conducted for the Multnomah CountyPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 66 An OJP Issues & Practices Report66 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportdrug offenders. Drug T reatment Alternative-to-Prison (DTAP), as the program is called, diverts prison-bound felony offenders to drug treatment. TheDistrict Attorney's office is primarily responsible forscreening offenders, referring them to treatment andcontracting with treatment providers. As of March2000, 1,136 defendants had been accepted into theprogram. Of this group, 439 successfully completedthe program and had their charges dismissed; 235clients were still in treatment. Federal legislation iscurrently being drafted to provide funds to communi-ties replicating DTAP . DTAP began under the premise that offenders were better prepared to resist drugs and crime if theyreceived treatment rather than more costly prisontime. The program targets drug-addicted defendantsarrested for nonviolent felony offenses who have atleast one prior felony conviction and face a mandato-ry prison sentence under New York State's Second-Felony Offender Law. Defendants enter a guilty pleaand receive a deferred sentence. After 15 to 24months in treatment, successful graduates have theircharges dismissed. The program used a deferred pros-ecution model (offender does not have to enter aplea) up until 1998, when the program was changedto increase retention rates. DTAP uses a graduatedsystem of rewards and sanctions which allows clientsto make a few mistakes before being sent to prison tocomplete their full sentence. An assistant district attorney screens all potential DTAP clients; those who meet program eligibility cri-teria are further screened by T reatment Alternatives toStreet Crime (TASC), a drug assessment and referralorganization. DTAP and TASC personnel worktogether to find the most appropriate treatment facili-ties for participating offenders, and the judge presid-ing over the case allows the defendant to entertreatment rather than prison. If the defendant is onprobation or parole, the New York City Departmentof Probation and the New York State Division ofParole must approve as well. Of the 132 defendantsaccepted into treatment in 1999, the average age was36, 61 percent were employed, 30 percent werereceiving public assistance, 53 percent reported thatheroin was their drug of choice, and 38 percentreported crack or cocaine. TASC also performs case management and monitors defendants' treatment progress. Clients aretreated in a therapeutic community, consisting of three treatment phases: orientation, during whichclients examine their beliefs about addiction and theirown patterns of behavior; primary treatment, whichinvolves individual, group, and family counseling; andre-entry, where clients focus on relapse prevention andadjusting to independent living. Participants alsoreceive vocational training and assistance in securinghousing when returning to the community. In order to assure public safety in the event of treatment failure, the district attorney's enforcementteam collects contact information on each client inDTAP to ensure that they can be located andreturned to custody if they leave the treatment pro-gram. The team has a record of returning 97 percentof clients to court in a median time of nine days. Challenges: The greatest challenge in implement- ing DTAP was convincing the treatment communitythat it would be beneficial for them to work withcriminal justice clients. T reatment providers fearedthat partnering with the criminal justice systemwould compromise their ability to protect and advo-cate for their clients, assure the safety of treatmentstaff, and maintain records of success with criminaloffenders. However, treatment providers soon realizedthat the threat of criminal sanctions produced bettertreatment results for criminal justice clients. Aftercriminal justice and treatment personnel understoodeach other's responsibilities and goals, they workedwell together. Another challenge was ensuring that DTAP par- ticipants were referred to the most appropriate treat-ment programs, and that DTAP personnel could keeptrack of their progress in treatment. To solve thisproblem, the TASC systems were integrated to helpDTAP refer and follow up on clients. Costs and Funding Sources: To replicate DTAP would cost approximately $270,000 annually, notincluding the cost of treatment. In New York, treat-ment costs are covered by the state, with 40 percentcoming from public assistance, 40 percent from theOffice of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, and theremainder from private sources. DTAP costs $18,000-$21,000 per year per client (compared to more than$60,000 per year for incarceration). DTAP costswould be lower in communities where services andsalaries are not as expensive as in New York. An OJP Issues & Practices Report 67Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 67Program Results: DTAP has proven successful on many levels. As of October 15, 1999: nRetention Rates \u2014The one-year retention rate for clients was 66 percent overall and had risento 74 percent since January 1998, when theprogram shifted from a deferred prosecutionmodel to a deferred sentencing model; nEmployment \u201492 percent of employable graduates were currently working, whereasonly 26 percent were employed upon arrest. Inaddition, a study of 117 graduates found thatthree-year recidivism was 33 percent amongthose who were unemployed, but 13 per-cent among those employed; nRecidivism \u2014The three-year reincarceration rate for program graduates was less than halfof the rate for the control group rate (23 per-cent compared to 47 percent); and nCost Saving \u2014The 439 successful DTAP clients saved $16.1 million in corrections,health care, public assistance, and recidivismcosts. DTAP is currently being evaluated by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuseat Columbia University. The $2 million evaluation isbeing funded by the National Institute on DrugAbuse, and preliminary results are promising. A sixmonth follow-up found that drug use declined morefor offenders in DTAP than for offenders in prison.Heroin use declined 71 percent among program par-ticipants versus 62 percent among the control group;similar declines were found for cocaine (85 percentversus 27 percent), crack (96 percent versus 51 per-cent), and marijuana (83 percent versus 69 percent). V. Alcohol-Related Approaches Alcohol, more than any other drug, is associated with high rates of criminal activity. According to theBureau of Justice Statistics, nearly four in ten violentoffenders report having committed their crimes underthe influence of alcohol, and about four in ten fatalmotor vehicle accidents are alcohol-related. 96In addi- tion, national surveys indicate that ten million youngpeople under the age of 21 drink alcohol at least oncea month. 97Underage drinkers often get alcohol from adults, who sell or provide it illegally. Law enforcementhas a large role to play in reducing alcohol-relatedproblems. Police officers are vital in identifying andarresting drunk drivers. Efforts by police to solvealcohol-related problems in communities improvesquality of life and reduces crime. One in ten arrests made in 1997 was for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). 98Large num- bers of DUI arrests stem from proactive approaches toarresting drunk drivers, such as checkpoints, whichconcentrate police resources at key times in high-riskplaces. According to Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, the greater the effort police put into proactive arrests, the greater their abil-ity to reduce drunk driving. 99Unfortunately, the time required to process a DUI arrest is often a deterrent tomore enforcement. The Impaired Driver EnforcementUnit (IDEU), developed by the National HighwayT raffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is designed toreduce the time a patrol officer spends processing aDUI arrest. Once an officer determines that a driveris impaired, an IDEU van responds to the call andhelps officers complete the booking process. InPhoenix, Arizona, which has six such vans in service,the time required to complete the arrest and bookingprocess decreased from over three hours to just onehour. Repeat DUI offenders pose a significant threat to the community. Innovative approaches targeting thesehigh-risk drivers are gaining popularity. Ignition inter-lock, for example, which connects a breathalyzer tothe car ignition, is an alternative to long-term licenserevocation. DUI probationers must blow into thedevice before starting their vehicles; if they have beendrinking, their ignitions will not operate. In HancockCounty, Indiana, almost all repeat DUI offenders hadthe device in their cars by 1993. Between 1990 and1995, DUI arrests in the county dropped 40 percent,and law enforcement officers attributed the decline toignition interlock. Another example is DUI court,which combines criminal sanctions with treatment toreduce DUI recidivism among drunk drivers withmultiple arrests. According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future study, conducted by researchers at the University ofMichigan, nearly 90 percent of tenth graders in theUnited States think alcohol is easy to get. 100IncreasedPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse 68 An OJP Issues & Practices Report68 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportsuch as street corner drinking. Police in Portland, Oregon worked with residents and local merchants toban oversized bottles of beer and malt liquor in anarea experiencing problems that stemmed from streetdrinking. Detoxification holds (which are indicatorsof heavy drinking) and drinking-in-public incidentswere both cut in half in Portland between 1993 and1996. While crimes such as driving under the influence are directly linked to alcohol consumption, the role ofalcohol in other crimes, such as domestic violence, isless obvious. More than two-thirds of domestic vio-lence victims report that the offender had been drink-ing prior to the offense. 103Police officers can be trained to identify the role of alcohol in a domesticviolence incident and to respond accordingly. Beingfamiliar with treatment options in the communitycan help police officers deal effectively with victimsand assailants. The following are successful examples of the vari- ous law enforcement initiatives that are underway toreduce alcohol-related crime in communities. DWI/Drug Court Program, Bernalillo, New Mexico Program Type: Alcohol-Related Approach. Target Audience: Nonviolent convicted of in Operation: 1997-present. Program Goals: To reduce recidivism of persons charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).Contact Information: Mark Pickle, Program Director, 505-841-8184. Description: In Bernalillo County, New Mexico, 5,000 people are arrested annually for driving whileintoxicated (DWI). In an effort to reduce the numberof arrests, Judge Michael Kavanaugh opened aDWI/Drug Court Program in July 1997. Eligibleoffenders go before a judge who combines criminalpenalties with court-mandated treatment in an effortto break the cycle of DWI recidivism. Since it opened,327 offenders have participated in the program, and128 have graduated. Nonviolent offenders convicted of at least three, but not more than five, DWIs are eligible for thelaw enforcement, including the use of sting opera- tions targeting alcohol merchants and underage buy-ers, is essential in reducing underage access to alcohol.For example, the Denver Police Department's compli-ance check program, aimed at package beer outlets,reported that sales to underage buyers decreased fromnearly 60 percent of attempts at the program's start to26 percent after two waves of compliance checks. 101 When targeting merchants, police officers often employ youths to attempt illegal sales, while otherpolice crackdowns on underage drinking target thedrinkers instead. Cops in Shops is one such programwhich has police officers posing as retail clerks.Offending youths are issued citations and, in someprograms, are required to attend educational sessionson the consequences of alcohol use. Police depart-ments often notify the media prior to implementing aCops in Shops program in an effort to deter underagebuyers. In many instances, police officers work with resi- dents to address alcohol-related issues that are causingproblems in communities. In response to residentcomplaints about a neighborhood bar in Hayward,California, for example, police officers met with resi-dents, mediated between the owner and residents,trained the bar's security staff to handle problems bet-ter, educated residents about civil court options, andworked with the Alcohol Beverage Control Board.After the police intervention, calls for service in thearea decreased from an average of 20 per month tojust one or two. Working with alcohol servers and retailers is another way for law enforcement to create partner-ships within the community. In North Carolina, forexample, Alcohol Law Enforcement officers conducta statewide B.A.R.S. (Be a Responsible Server) pro-gram, which educates licensed establishments andtheir employees about responsible sales of alcohol andchecking for proper identification. In addition to bars and taverns, stores licensed to sell alcohol for off-premises consumption can createproblems. A 1999 study of alcohol outlets in NewOrleans found a 2 percent increase in the homiciderate for every 10 percent increase in the density ofsuch establishments. 102Alcohol outlet density has also been associated with increased motor vehicle acci-dents and other problems that degrade neighborhoods, An OJP Issues & Practices Report 69Law Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 6970 An OJP Issues & Practices Reportprogram. Although almost all\u201498 percent\u2014of the participants are DWI offenders, the court also acceptsother types of offenders who are addicted to alcoholor other drugs. The court is a postconviction, presen-tence voluntary program; offenders must be convictedbefore they enter the program. Program participantsare supervised by DWI/Drug Court probation offi-cers, receive mandatory alcohol and other drug treat-ment, comply with random drug testing, completecommunity service, attend victim impact panels, andappear regularly before the judge. The judge isresponsible for imposing sanctions on clients as wellas rewarding them when they comply with the pro-gram. Clients often develop a positive relationshipwith the judge, wanting to succeed in part to pleasehim. Defendants who violate conditions of the pro- gram face sanctions, which include a mandatoryappearance before the judge and either a reductionin \"points\" (a certain number are needed to progressthrough treatment) or jail time. Upon completionof the treatment program, offenders are sentenced.They receive the mandatory minimum sentence, butinstead of serving time in jail they may enter an alter-native program in which they are allowed to work butmust remain at home during nonworking hours. Participants receive an average of 24 weeks of treatment, which includes counseling and 12-stepmeetings. During the treatment phase of the program,clients regularly appear before the drug court judgeand meet with the probation officer. Urinalysis is usedto detect alcohol and other drug use. Education andjob training are also provided. During 12 weeks ofaftercare, clients meet with a probation officer weekly,attend at least one counseling session per week, attend12-step meetings and receive random urinalysis andbreathalyzer testing. Program participants are requiredto pay for their treatment on a sliding scale. Taking advantage of recent technological advances, Bernalillo is working with BI Inc. of Boulder, Colorado,to monitor repeat DWI offenders at home usingremote breathalyzer units. These units are installed inthe mouthpieces of standard telephone systems andtransmit test information over telephone lines to amonitoring station. At random times during the dayor evening, a preprogrammed computer can call theremote unit and lead the offender through animpromptu breath test. The unit is very accurateand is nearly impossible to circumvent. Typically, a judge will order a unit installed in a repeat offender'shome for approximately six weeks. Bernalillo current-ly operates five of these units. Challenges: One of the challenges in implement- ing the Bernalillo DWI/Drug Court was convincingparticipants that they would benefit from the treat-ment program. Most other drug courts operate at thefelony level, and judges have the power to dismiss cas-es when clients successfully complete treatment. InBernalillo, however, offenders convicted of their thirdDWI arrest must serve a minimum sentence whetheror not they enter a treatment program. In order tomake the program worthwhile for clients, the courtguarantees that those who successfully complete theprogram will receive no more than the mandatorysentence, will be allowed to serve their sentence athome while remaining employed, and will not be puton probation after the minimum amount of time isserved. A second challenge was convincing the public defender's office that the program was beneficial to itsclients. At first, public defenders were wary about rec-ommending the program to their clients because theywould not get credit for their time in treatment ifthey failed the program. A few months after the pro-gram began, however, it was clear that clients werebenefitting from it. Costs and Funding Sources: Cost per client is approximately $2,400, which covers treatment andadministrative costs. Funding comes from local, state,and federal sources as well as clients' co-pays (average$1,500-$1,800 per month for all clients). Costs forreplicating the program would include treatment costsand the costs of paying a program director, one paroleofficer for every 30 clients, and a judge working a fewhours per week. Program Results: According to internal data from the DWI court, statistics for the 128 clientsgraduating the program between July 1997 andMarch 2000 are promising. nOnly 9 percent of program graduates havebeen rearrested for DWI, compared to the 35to 40 percent average recidivism ratefor DWI offenders sentenced to traditionalprobation; andPromising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseLaw Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 71nThe program's retention rate is 82 percent. The DWI/Drug Court is in the process of con- tracting with the University of New Mexico to con-duct a two-year follow up study of programparticipants. Checkpoint Tennessee, The State of Tennessee Program Type: Alcohol-Related Approach. Target Audience: Drivers with blood alcohol levels exceeding the legal limit.Years in Operation: 1994-present. Program Goals: To implement a statewide sobriety checkpoint in an effort to reduce alcohol-relatedcrashes and fatalities.Contact Information: T rooper Tim Dover, Tennessee Highway Patrol, 615-741-0065. Description: In March 1994, the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) partnered with the NationalHighway T raffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA)to conduct and evaluate a statewide sobriety check-point program that uses random testing to determinewhether a driver has been drinking. Between April 1,1994, and March 31, 1995, a total of 882 check-points were conducted, compared to a previous annu-al average of ten to 15. A total of 144,299 driverspassed through these checkpoints, resulting in 773arrests for driving under the influence and an addi-tional 201 arrests for other drug violations. One ofthe goals of Checkpoint Tennessee is to deter peoplefrom driving while intoxicated, and all checkpointsare advertised ahead of time. During the first year of the program there were checkpoints in at least four counties every weekend,and in all counties on five weekends. Every Mondaymorning, all eight THP districts were required to sub-mit reports of activity at checkpoints conducted theprevious weekend. The reports were tabulated by theTHP planning and resources section and used tomonitor implementation of the program and to pro-vide information for news releases. One of the goals of the program is to ensure that states wishing to replicate the model can do so withlittle outside help. Toward this end, NHTSA fundsare used only for equipment and evaluation; thecheckpoints are staffed by reassigning Tennessee Highway Patrol officers. Each checkpoint is requiredto have a minimum of four uniformed officers forreasons of safety and visibility. The TennesseeHighway Patrol invites officers from local depart-ments in the region of each checkpoint to participate.In each of the eight THP districts, four officers weretrained to operate vans outfitted with alcohol detec-tion equipment, such as breathalyzers and passivealcohol sensors (flashlights which can detect the smellof alcohol). Publicity is an important aspect of Checkpoint Tennessee. The program is covered on television andadvertised on billboards statewide. Press releasesannounce checkpoints and detail the number of carspassing through checkpoints and the number ofdrunk drivers arrested. Surveys administered in driverlicense renewal offices throughout Tennessee before,during, and after the first year of the program foundthat 90 percent of citizens supported the use ofcheckpoints. Based on the success of the Tennessee program, NHTSA awarded grants of $1 million to Tennessee,Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Georgia to con-duct a 30-month program, beginning in the summerof 2000, aimed at reducing drunk driving fatalitiesusing checkpoints, saturation patrols, and increasedpublic awareness. NHTSA will evaluate the results ofthe programs, and a best practices manual will be writ-ten to guide other states in replicating the program. Challenges: There were significant logistical chal- lenges in implementing Checkpoint Tennessee, sinceall of the checkpoints had to be scheduled one year inadvance. Another logistical difficulty was getting per-sonnel and equipment to each checkpoint; four spe-cially equipped vans had to be shared by eight THPdistricts. After a few checkpoints were conducted andthe program became routine, personnel and equip-ment challenges were overcome. Costs and Funding Sources: The total cost of the two-year demonstration project was $927,594.The state provided $475,339 for police salaries, pub-licity costs, and other program expenses. The fundsused for the salaries were reallocated TennesseeHighway Patrol funds rather than new funding.NHTSA funding covered educational materials,equipment, and the program evaluation. Of the72 An OJP Issues & Practices ReportNHTSA funding, $350,000 was for equipment, including the vans, passive alcohol sensors, generatorsto run the equipment at the checkpoints, mobilelighting to illuminate the checkpoint area, and roadsigns alerting drivers to the presence of the check-point. Once the equipment has been purchased, thecosts are primarily for staff salaries. Many larger com-munities already have the equipment necessary toconduct checkpoints, which would substantiallyreduce program costs. Program Results: Results from the NHTSA eval- uation are promising. During the first year of the pro-gram, drunk-driving fatal crashes were reduced by20.4 percent, a reduction of nine fatal crashes permonth. This reduction was sustained for at least 21months after completion of the formal program.Another important measure of success is that theTennessee Highway Patrol has continued to conductcheckpoints more often than before the programbegan. In 1999 there were 287 checkpoints, com-pared to the usual ten to 15 conducted annually. Secret Shopper, The State of North Carolina Program Type: Alcohol-Related Approach. Target Audience: Establishments with liquor licenses. Years in Operation: 1999-present. Program Goals: Reduce alcohol sales to minors. Contact Information: Angela Hayes, North Carolina Alcohol Law Enforcement, 919-733-4060. Description: In 1999, North Carolina Alcohol Law Enforcement (ALE) initiated Secret Shopperwith funding from the Combating UnderageDrinking Program, a grant program of the Officeof Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention(OJJDP). Secret Shopper is a statewide programdesigned to reduce underage alcohol sales by employ-ing young people who have been trained by police toattempt to purchase alcohol illegally from retailers.The need for the program was great. According to the1997 North Carolina Youth Risk Behavior Survey,two-thirds of high school students said it was easy topurchase alcohol from stores. During 1999, youthsemployed by ALE visited 1,000 Alcohol BeverageControl (ABC) licensed outlets. ALE has received asecond OJJDP grant and will conduct 4,100 SecretShopper visits in 2000.During the first phase of the program, conducted in March 1999, youths were sent into 500 randomlyselected businesses while ALE agents waited outside.If merchants were willing to make the sale, minorshanded them fake money along with a flier statingthat if the money had been real the merchant wouldhave been arrested by the agents waiting outside. Theprogram is designed to foster a working relationshipbetween retailers and the police. Merchants whorefused to sell to minors were given a certificate ofappreciation from the chief of police, along with abutton reading \"I survived Secret Shopper.\" The second phase of the program was conducted in October and November of 1999. All of the retailerswho sold to minors in the first phase were revisited,along with randomly selected sites which did not selland some randomly selected new sites, a total of 500businesses. All merchants visited by Secret Shopper are invit- ed to participate in the B.A.R.S. (Be A ResponsibleServer) educational program. B.A.R.S. teaches mer-chants how to sell alcohol responsibly by checkingidentification and recognizing fake IDs. ALE agentsreinforce the state's alcohol laws and introduce mer-chants to any new laws. Although the program hasnot been evaluated, results from the Secret Shopperprogram show that merchants who attend B.A.R.S.are less likely to sell alcohol to minors. Along with conducting 1,000 Secret Shopper vis- its, ALE used the OJJDP grant to educate local lawenforcement agencies throughout the state in threetraining sessions. Participating officers received copiesof a training video and manual on how to conductcompliance checks. Copies of the video and manualwere also mailed to all law enforcement agencies thatdid not attend. The second OJJDP grant will allow ALE to conduct 4,100 additional visits; 2,600 of these visitswill be in the ten counties with the highest rates ofalcohol-related youth crime and traffic crashes. Theremainder of the visits will be randomly dispersedthroughout the state. All local law enforcement offi-cials, not just ALE agents, will be invited to partici-pate in the program and will receive a fee for each sitevisit they conduct. Unlike visits conducted under thefirst grant, law enforcement officials will have theoption of arresting merchants who sell alcohol tominors. Visits are scheduled to begin in August 2000.Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance AbuseLaw Enforcement An OJP Issues & Practices Report 73Challenges: The main implementation challenge of Secret Shopper was targeting a random sample ofbusinesses. In order to do a random sample, all estab-lishments randomly selected should be visited.However, some of the establishments randomly select-ed (topless bars and establishments with a history ofviolence) were unsafe for youths and were thereforeexcluded from the program. Costs and Funding Sources: Secret Shopper was funded with a $168,250 grant from OJJDP . This cov-ered all costs of the project, including overtime payfor ALE agents and hourly wages for the youth work-ers ($5.55). Additional costs included printing thetraining manual and purchasing a color printer toproduce the fliers handed to merchants. For a com-munity looking to implement a similar program,costs would be minimal. Local law enforcement canconduct the site visits, and the only costs are youths' wages and any rewards for merchants who refuse tosell to minors. Program Results: According to ALE data, the program showed that both the Secret Shopper pro-gram and the B.A.R.S. program significantly con-tributed to reduced alcohol sales to minors. Duringthe first phase of the program, 26 percent of the busi-nesses visited sold alcohol to minors. During the sec-ond phase of the program, of the establishments whooriginally sold to minors: n29 percent of those who did not attendB.A.R.S. sold to minors a second time; and nOnly 16 percent of those who attendedB.A.R.S. sold to minors a second time.An OJP Issues & Practices Report 75Conclusion Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse describes the most effective preven- tion, treatment, and law enforcement strategies. Programs that incorporate elementsof these strategies are included to demonstrate how some communities are combatingsubstance abuse and related problems. The report is designed to give community resi-dents and local policy makers tools for constructing approaches best suited to meettheir goals. An essential component of effective local programming is collaboration among various sectors of the community. Prevention, treatment, and law enforcement sys-tems, personnel, and resources are all part of the continuum of care vital to the suc-cess of anti-drug strategies, and they can work together to respond to the costs ofsubstance abuse. Community leaders from schools, family groups, social services,police, probation, the courts, and others are more effective working together thanworking alone. To combat substance abuse and related crime, it is also important for communi- ties to spend their often limited resources implementing programs that have shownpromise. The growing emphasis on \"what works\" requires that communities learnfrom each other and implement program models with track records of success. Theprograms in the report can be modified to fit the needs and resources of a specificcommunity. When a program model is replicated, it must be evaluated to ensure it isworking in the new community. Incorporating an evaluation plan into programdevelopment is critical. Evidence that a program works is also essential when appeal-ing for public and private funding. Communities looking to implement promising anti-drug approaches should first assess their greatest areas of need. For example, increases in youth alcohol, tobacco,and other drug use may call for a greater focus on prevention and treatment, whileviolent drug-trafficking may require heightened law enforcement activities.Determining gaps in services currently provided is an essential step. The local healthdepartment, police department, other state and local agencies, and citizens should allbe involved in assessing community need. Promising Strategies to Reduce Substance Abuse provides communities with infor- mation on what approaches are effectively reducing substance abuse and related prob-lems nationwide and is intended to assist them in determining how strategies andprograms can address their specific needs.An OJP Issues & Practices Report 77Endnotes 1.
