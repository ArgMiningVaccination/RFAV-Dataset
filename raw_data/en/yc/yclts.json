First, the remarkable diversity and complexity of these diseases require highly innovative treatment solutions. Second, the current societal pressures to transform healthcare delivery necessitate the creation of novel therapeutic approaches that maximize healthcare safety, efficacy and value. These unique and interdependent challenges suggest the need for entirely new methods of delivering neuroscience healthcare services - methods that allow for the provision of advanced, high-quality, patient-centered care across the broad continuum of neurological and neurosurgical conditions. At Atrium Health, our Neurosciences Institute was designed to provide precisely this type of essential, transformational care. This is an exciting time for our program. The national growth in neuroscience research has created unprecedented opportunities for our researchers and clinicians to improve the health and well-being of the patients we serve. The vast clinical support and information technology assets at Atrium Health provide us with unique abilities to measurably improve quality and intelligently transform the delivery of neuroscience services. In short, the goal of Neurosciences Institute is to be a vanguard in the quality reformation that is sweeping modern healthcare. We appreciate this opportunity to introduce you to our people and programs of expertise. Please do not hesitate to contact us directly if we can provide you with additional information. Anthony L.

We transform those challenges into effective solutions through technical sophistication and comprehensive care. We are committed to providing technically advanced, comprehensive, personalized care to all of our patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. We are able to achieve this goal by virtue of our large clinical volumes, our relationship with numerous world- class cancer specialists at Levine Cancer Institute (LCI), our nurse navigator program, our clinical and translational research programs, and our team of surgical neuro-oncologists, who collectively have among the highest level of experience removing complex brain tumors of any center in the country. Advanced treatments to facilitate brain tumor care As a major brain tumor center, Neurosciences Institute, in close collaboration with LCI, has significant experience in leading-edge therapies. Examples include: Clinical trials. Our surgical and non-surgical clinical trials, including quality and patient-centered outcomes research, are designed to make the greatest impact on advancing clinical practice. Numerous advanced clinical trials are available to patients with both primary and metastatic brain cancers. Minimally invasive and skull base techniques. These advanced surgical techniques allow for less invasive, more focused and more effective tumor removal. Examples include: \u009fTransnasal endoscopic and supraorbital \"eyebrow\" approaches, along with other methods of accessing the cranial cavity through minimally invasive approaches, give our neurosurgeons improved access to deep-seated tumors and cause less disruption and damage to blood vessels, nerves and other vital tissues. \u009fAdvanced image guidance and computer simulation of essential brain pathways facilitate treatment planning and provide real-time feedback to improve patient safety and reduce complications. New computer simulations allow us to see beyond the surface of the surgical field to view essential deep-seated structures and pathways in the brain, thus facilitating removal of lesions while preserving critical neurological functions. \u009fHigh-field intraoperative MRI will soon allow our surgeons to image tumors and surrounding neural tissues in real time, further enhancing our capability to perform safe, effective brain tumor resections. Combination therapies. We are a leading national center in the development of novel combination therapies involving radiosurgery (focused radiation therapy) and traditional surgical techniques. Comprehensive care and cutting-edge research that redefine clinical practice The many complexities of brain cancer require a sophisticated, coordinated care team. Along with our own specialists in neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neuropathology, neurology, physiatry and neuro- psychology, we work closely with the nationally recognized medical and radiation oncologists of LCI to offer the latest front-line and experimental chemotherapy and immunotherapy regimens. In addition, our growing nurse navigator program provides a seamless, supportive experience for our patients and families, helping them transition to post-acute and community-based care.As part of our comprehensive approach to brain tumor care, we are committed to not only delivering cutting-edge therapies but also continually and cooperatively advancing the science of care. For example, Anthony Asher, MD, (Neurosciences Institute) and Stuart Burri, MD, (LCI) helped lead a 10-year national landmark study (recently published in The Journal of the American Medical Association ) providing definitive evidence that most patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy and should ideally be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life. In large part due to this research, the shift to more focused therapies for brain metastases is gaining ground, and this tumor surgeries PER YEAR Dr. Anthony Asher performing a right frontal craniotomy.500+trend has been supported by ongoing clinical research at our institution. In our mission to develop the best treatment solutions for patients, we work closely with major cooperative groups such as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and other academic institutions in investigating new treatment opportunities, such as immune potentiation (i.e., boosting the immune system to help combat cancer). This program is a collaboration between Atrium Health's Levine Cancer Institute and Neurosciences Institute. 5 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 6Comprehensive Spine Spine disorders are among the most common causes of pain and disability in society. We are committed to providing our patients with the most advanced treatment options available. From the most complex spinal deformities to emergency spinal trauma, our dedicated specialists stand at the forefront of advanced care. We continue to expand therapeutic options in spinal surgery - particularly in the realm of minimally invasive spine surgery - with the goal of hastening clinical recovery and helping more patients achieve a better quality of life. Our spine care program represents an exciting collaborative effort between Neurosciences Institute and the newly formed Atrium Health Musculoskeletal Institute, bringing together all major providers of spine services to advance the quality, safety and value of care. Advancing minimally invasive surgical options We specialize in adopting, creating and applying the growing number of minimally invasive techniques designed to significantly reduce pain and recovery times for patients. Tim Adamson, MD, a faculty surgeon at Neurosciences Institute, pioneered the cervical microendoscopic discectomy procedure, using a tubular retractor system and endoscope to safely visualize and remove damaged material to decompress the cervical spine. We have also developed novel minimally invasive surgical techniques for cervical and lumbar fusion procedures. Unparalleled expertise across procedures and conditions With 25+ neurosurgeons and 9 orthopedic spine surgeons highly skilled at performing a full range of standard and cutting-edge spinal procedures, our hospitals and specialty centers are well positioned to deliver national caliber care. In addition to minimally invasive procedures, we specialize in treating: Spinal tumors (including interventional angiography) Degenerative spine disorders for older patients whose conditions may have previously been considered inoperable Revision surgery for patients who had unsuccessful results in other care settings Complicated spinal trauma Spinal deformities, including scoliosis and kyphosis Advancing the science of spine care Our longstanding commitment to surgical research and large patient volumes enables our faculty to offer innovative clinical trials at four of our hospitals. Our surgeons participate in investigator-initiated and industry- sponsored trials. Domagoj Coric, MD, chairman of neurological surgery at Carolinas Medical Center, chief of neurosurgery at Neurosciences Institute, and chief of the spine care program at Musculoskeletal Institute, is a leading innovator in the development of new technologies for cervical and lumbar spine disc replacement. He also leads other important studies including investigations of biological solutions for spinal cord injury and disc repair. Improving spine care safety and value We are a leading center in defining, measuring and promoting safe and effective treatment alternatives for spine care. Our surgeons have helped to create the largest national clinical registry of spinal procedures, and we have partnered with groups across the country to develop methods to apply the insights gained from clinical registries to continually improve care. We have adopted advanced real-time imaging and robotic technologies to promote safer, less-invasive surgical procedures. Additionally, we are committed to comprehensive spine care solutions, which means that we strive to offer the best therapies for specific patients and clinical problems - reserving surgery for those instances when more conservative care solutions have been exhausted. In fact, our extensive experience allows us to avoid surgery whenever possible; more than half of the patients we evaluate are offered and benefit from non-surgical treatments.Leading surgical volumes in the Carolinas 2,750 inpatient spinal surgeries in 2017 Adult only (Truven, HPM, SC Office of Research and Statistics, internal data)Treatments performed Artificial disc implantation (lumbar, cervical) Instrumented spinal fusions Anterior discectomy and fusion Anterior and posterior spinal instrumentation Anterior odontoid screw fixation C1-C2 transarticular screw fixation and fusion Pedicle screw fixation Posterior lumbar interbody fusion Adult and surgery Dr. Domagoj Coric performing a posterior lumbar fusion.

Our highly specialized neurosurgeons - combined with our experienced nursing and ancillary team - provide individualized care for the most complex cranial and spine patients. Neurotrauma Surgery From traumatic brain injury to spinal cord injury, we provide comprehensive care for large volumes of traumatic neurologic injuries. We offer the region's only Level I trauma center, including a designated neurosurgical intensive care unit that serves both adults and pediatric patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Following surgery, we seamlessly transition patients to our trauma rehabilitation services, providing early intervention to traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury patients.Functional Neurosurgery We treat all chronic neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, movement disorders and pain, with the goal of restoring neurological function. We offer advanced surgical options to alleviate epilepsy, including lobe resection, lesionectomy, Corpus callosotomy, functional nerve stimulation and responsive neurostimulation device implantation. We are one of the most experienced centers in the mid-Atlantic region for treating trigeminal neuralgia (TN). We offer all major radiosurgery, microvascular decompression and percutaneous rhyzolysis. Skull Base Surgery We use innovative minimally invasive procedures to remove benign and malignant tumors close to the base of the skull, including those in the nose, sinuses, eyes and pituitary. Accessing the skull base through the nasal passages and incisions above the eyebrow results in decreased recovery time for patients and less disruption and damage to blood vessels, nerves and other tissue, and usually requires much smaller incisions. Pediatric Neurosurgery Levine Children's Hospital's pediatric neurology and neurosurgery program, named one of the nation's best by U.S. News & World Report , offers advanced care across the continuum. With the largest team of pediatric neurosurgeons on the East Coast outside of Boston, we care for the full range of pediatric neurosurgical disorders, including brain tumors, spasticity, movement disorders, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, craniosynostosis, head injuries and spina bifida, as well as other cranial malformations and spinal deformities.Neurosurgery by the Numbers Neurovascular Surgery Neurovascular surgery is now making treatment possible for a variety of life-threatening vascular diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, carotid stenosis and stroke. Using minimally invasive procedures, we can treat these conditions without opening the skull, neck or back, resulting in potentially shorter hospital stays, fewer possible complications, less pain and a quicker recovery period. 439 CASES 130 CASES 1,76 0 CASES220 CASES 9 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 10Comprehensive Cerebrovascular Care From emergent interventions for acute stroke patients to the latest aneurysm treatments, we deliver the highest quality cerebrovascular care available. For the full range of cerebrovascular disease, our expert interdisciplinary teams are committed to the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of the most complex cases. Our stroke program includes a Comprehensive Stroke Center and five other hospitals certified as Advanced Primary Stroke Centers by The Joint Commission. Within this advanced system of care, we treat more stroke patients than any other program in the Carolinas, offering the experience and resources to provide lifesaving care around the clock. Advanced stroke care, delivered faster Carolinas Stroke Network connects hospitals across the region, offering accelerated treatment for patients suffering from an acute stroke. From the moment patients arrive, they receive comprehensive and individualized treatment plans, using the latest CT brain imaging techniques to identify the best patients for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or intra-arterial (IA) treatment. At Carolinas Medical Center and Carolinas HealthCare System NorthEast, we offer 24/7 access to IA treatment for complex large vessel occlusion strokes, performing 150+ IA mechanical thrombectomy cases per year. Our Comprehensive Stroke Center at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte treats some of the highest volumes of hemorrhagic strokes in the country. In 2017, our telestroke program became the largest in the region, providing advanced stroke services to 20+ facilities across the Carolinas. Using state-of-the- art, interactive telemedicine capabilities allows our stroke experts immediate access to patients to coordinate rapid bedside assessment and treatment - no matter where patients are seen in our network. This cutting-edge approach has helped patients receive the critical treatment they need as much as 17 percent faster than our previous approach. Rehabilitation that makes a difference Positive long-term outcomes for stroke patients depend not just on acute care but also on effective rehabilitation. As one of the largest and most comprehensive stroke rehabilitation programs in the Southeast, we dedicate state-of-the- art resources to helping our patients recover faster. Our experienced teams - including board- certified physicians, physical and occupational therapists, certified rehabilitation registered nurses and neuropsychologists - are pursuing first-in-the-world therapeutic approaches, such as the implantation of neuro- stimulation devices to control hemiplegic shoulder pain. Our capabilities have helped us become the first multisite stroke rehabilitation program to earn certification from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Advanced aneurysm therapies We are leading the way in endovascular neurosurgery in the Carolinas, as more complex cerebral aneurysms are treated with minimally invasive catheter-based techniques. Using coil microcatheter-delivered, flow-diverting stents and other new methods, our neurosurgeons are highly experienced in treating cerebral aneurysms. This includes those that are anatomically inaccessible to traditional surgical approaches and those with complex three-dimensional geometry. Our cerebrovascular surgeons have achieved some of the best patient outcome rates in the country, helping to send aneurysm patients home sooner and with higher levels of functional capacity.Conditions treated Acute ischemic strokes Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) Moyamoya disease 3,400+ stroke patients treated per year MOST IN THE CAROLINAS 22 facilities in our Telestroke Network that provide stroke care across the CarolinasDr. Jonathan Clemente reviewing neuroimaging. 11 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 12Epilepsy Every patient with epilepsy is different. So is our approach to treatment. Helping patients gain control of their seizures can take any number of forms including medication, diet therapy, surgery and/or device implantation. We're proud to offer a truly comprehensive epilepsy program experienced in providing the full range of treatment modalities for adults and children. From initial assessment to long- term management, our epilepsy care team is here to provide the highest level of individualized care. Identifying the source of seizures with precision Developing the right treatment plan starts with a rigorous assessment that pinpoints the source of seizures. We offer a state-of-the-art neurodiagnostic laboratory, which is among the few accredited in the state of North Carolina, and epilepsy monitoring units that have achieved top accreditation from the National Association of Epilepsy Centers. Carolinas Medical Center is a Level IV epilepsy center, and Carolinas HealthCare System NorthEast is a Level III epilepsy center for both adult and pediatric epilepsy. Beginning with our First Seizure Clinic, our team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists and neuro- psychologists performs an extensive evaluation, employing EEG, 3T MRI brain imaging with 3D volumetric post-process software and functional MRI, PET and SPECT scans, as well as advanced software for seizure-focus localization, tracking and trending.Putting the best technologies to work Our diagnostic and treatment options include some of the latest technologies available: Intracranial monitoring with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and subdural electrodes Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT procedure) Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems to deliver electrical stimulation that terminates seizures before symptoms can begin Brain mapping, including speech and sensorimotor mapping Foramen ovale electrode recording Dietary therapy Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) implantation and programming In conjunction with Levine Children's Hospital, we offer pediatric patients surgical and non-surgical therapies, including ketogenic dietary plans. 6,472 epilepsy/seizure inpatients (2017) 29% annual growth in epilepsy surgeries (2016) 1 OF ONLY 2 US centers with Joint Commission Disease-Specific Care Certification in Inpatient Epilepsy Surgical options MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy incorporate state-of-the-art intraoperative navigation, enabling minimally invasive epilepsy surgery. The navigation system is beneficial for all types of cranial intervention requiring surgical planning based on pre-operative data, precise location of the patient's anatomy, and accurate positioning and handling of instruments. This device assists the surgeon with a wide variety of medical indications and surgical interventions, such as biopsies, electrode implantation for functional procedures (stimulation of the cerebral cortex, deep brain stimulation), open skull surgical procedures requiring a navigation device, endoscopic interventions and any other \"keyhole\" procedures. In addition, the tele-epilepsy network provides remote EEG and continuous 24-hour EEG monitoring and reading services for facilities throughout Atrium Health, providing patients access to advanced expertise in diagnosis and treatment of seizures. 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Admissions Continuous EEG Monitoring 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Bringing Innovation to the Region 13 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 14Multiple Sclerosis As the treatment options for Multiple Sclerosis evolve, we seek out the most promising medical advances to bring hope to our patients.

Led by internationally recognized experts, our comprehensive Carolinas Neuromuscular/ALS/MDA Center offers the latest in diagnostic assessments and therapeutic options. We are also leading the way - through our research and advocacy - in the development and deployment of lifesaving treatments that will shape the future standard of care. Groundbreaking clinical research Founded nearly 20 years ago, our center has been at the forefront of translational research and therapy development for neuromuscular diseases, particularly for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In collaboration with the Northeast ALS (NEALS) and Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) consortia, our ALS program: Played a key role in the development of two major FDA-approved therapies for ALS: riluzole and dextromethorphan/quinidine Conducted the largest single-site study for ALS in the world and the largest ALS study related to swallowing Helped to clarify several aspects of ALS care, including: \u009fBenefits of exercise \u009fApplicability of certain walking tests to diagnosis \u009fRelationship between balance and spasticity as controlled by a particular defect in the nervous system Is nationally recognized for our physician leadership and expertise Through advocacy, helped fast-track FDA approval for breakthrough treatments in the US, including edaravone, which had already been available in Japan In addition, our McColl-Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Research focuses on developing novel therapies - including gene and antisense therapies - for degenerative neuromuscular disorders, such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Expertise from diagnosis to treatment Our interdisciplinary team of specialists helps our patients maintain their independence through slowing disease progression. In addition to the latest pharmacological treatments, we offer a team approach to treatment with physical, occupational, speech, nutritional and respiratory therapies, and have dedicated ALS, expedited ventilator, spinal muscular atrophy and neurotoxicology clinics. We offer our patients some of the highest levels of respiratory support, resulting in better outcomes and improved quality of life. From electromyography to nerve conduction studies, we are highly experienced in the full range of neurodiagnostic services and can accurately determine the cause of a patient's symptoms - whether that is ALS, an ALS mimic, an underlying cancer or an autoimmune disease. We are currently exploring different phenotypes of ALS - and the different therapy protocols required to treat them. Conditions treated Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Dysimmune neuropathies Muscular dystrophy Motor neuropathies Myasthenia gravisWe received the first Disease-Specific Care Certification in ALS by The Joint Commission. 11 clinical trials & registries 548 patients enrolledOnly ALS-MDA Center in the Carolinas designated by the Muscular Dystrophy Association 18 17 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders We continue to redefine what is possible for a wide range of movement disorders. For 10+ years, the experts at our Parkinson's disease and movement disorders program have offered specialized care for the most disabling cases. Our experience in innovative medical management and surgical interventions, combined with our commitment to quality and a holistic view of patient care, earned our center the first in the nation Disease-Specific Care Certification in Parkinson's disease from The Joint Commission. Advancing deep brain stimulation As the only provider of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in the Charlotte area, we are incorporating new approaches and technologies that can improve the quality of life, outcomes and experience for our patients with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, such as essential tremor and dystonia. Our specialists utilize a patient-customized frameless stereotactic device that reduces operating time and increases the accuracy of electrode placement.

As one of the largest providers of its kind in the Southeast, Carolinas Rehabilitation offers specialized resources and technology to give our patients the best chance of recovery. Across inpatient and outpatient settings, our comprehensive care has earned accreditation by CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) for 12 of our programs - the most of any rehabilitation center in North Carolina. Specialized therapy for major neurological conditions Our team of board-certified rehabilitation specialists aim to restore the highest possible level of functioning, treating virtually any type of neurological condition, including: Stroke. From being the first institution in the world to implant a neurostimulation device for the treatment of post-stroke shoulder pain to serving as one of 29 assessment sites in the United States studying stem cell implantations, our stroke program leads the way in state-of-the-art care. We were one of the first facilities in the nation to apply for and receive CARF certification in stroke. Our intensive inpatient therapy (up to three hours per day) leads to 69 percent of stroke patients being sent home rather than to skilled nursing facilities. Brain injury. As a TBI Model System follow-up site, we provide high-quality treatment and conduct research aimed at helping patients with traumatic brain injury. Serving local communities, the Brain Injury Association of North Carolina (BIANC) Charlotte Resource Office at Carolinas Rehabilitation promotes awareness and education about TBI throughout Charlotte. Spinal cord injury. No other regional facility offers more advanced spinal cord injury services, including an innovative outpatient day program to help patients deal with challenges associated with wellness, health literacy and vocational training. A full suite of neurorehabilitation services With five inpatient facilities and 20+ outpatient facilities, we provide neurorehabilitation for adults and children, including the only pediatric inpatient rehab facility in the region. In addition to physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and audiologic rehabilitation, we also offer services specifically designed for patients suffering from neurological symptoms, including: Robot-assisted gait training to improve guidance, strength and circulation - particularly for spinal cord injury patients - using Lokomat\u00ae and ReWalk technologies Better Balance Program to help patients who have fallen recently or are unsteady on their feet Neuropsychology to assess a patient's thinking skills, behavior and emotional functioning Wheelchair seating clinic to provide specialized evaluations for complex or custom medical equipment Raising the standards for quality Our commitment to quality extends beyond clinical care. We created the EQUADRSM (Exchanged Quality Data for Rehabilitation) network to help inpatient rehabilitation facilities drive quality improvement by sharing best practices. As the first patient safety organization (PSO) designated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality specifically for inpatient rehabilitation settings, Carolinas Rehabilitation is helping to improve quality and patient safety across 19 states in areas such as prevention of falls. 12 CARF- accredited programs including brain injury, spinal cord injury and strokeMore Patients with Complex Conditions Inpatient rehabilitation volumes in 2016 (2016 eRehab) ~1,000 stroke patients 437 brain injury patients 272 spinal cord injury patients Dr. William Bockenek, neurorehabilitation expert, working with his patient. 21 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 22Quality and Patient Outcomes We're truly listening to the patient voice to improve the safety and value of healthcare.Clinical Neurology Research Study by study, we're building the foundation for what's possible in neuroscience care. Improving patient health and creating a better patient experience begin with fully understanding care from the standpoint of all healthcare stakeholders. At Neurosciences Institute, we are using patient care data, including patient-reported outcomes, to objectively measure the safety, value and quality of the care we provide to help advance our clinical performance. This embrace of continuous improvement has led us to spearhead national quality initiatives as well as our own efforts to revolutionize modern healthcare. A national model for quality improvement Our commitment to the quality movement extends far beyond our walls. Anthony Asher, MD, director and chief of clinical operations for Neurosciences Institute, and Matthew McGirt, MD, Neurosciences Institute faculty member and nationally respected spine surgeon, co-founded the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD), a continuous national clinical registry for neurosurgical procedures and practice patterns. Over the past six years, the QOD has helped the neurosurgical profession redefine quality care for spinal surgery with new initiatives planned in brain tumor, cerebrovascular care and stereotactic radiosurgery. The QOD is now in place in 140+ medical centers nationwide - with ongoing collaborations involving international quality stakeholders, such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). In this way, the QOD is helping to transform the course of modern neurosurgical care. Beyond participating in national registries like the QOD, we have begun our own longitudinal database of stroke outcomes led by Andrew Asimos, MD, medical director of Carolinas Stroke Network - with some of the largest numbers of enrolled patients in the country. In addition, we have made significant investments in data collection platforms and staffing to ensure our quality science competencies continue to improve. Weaving quality into our clinical practice Prospective, systematic tracking of practice patterns and patient outcomes at Neurosciences Institute has made quality assessment a keystone of our mission. However, clinical data collection, while necessary for quality improvement, cannot advance that objective as an isolated activity. In that regard, we have made a commitment to intelligently apply that data in every aspect of our daily activities. In other words, continuous quality improvement is now a routine aspect of patient care. Our objective at Neurosciences Institute is not only to provide quality leadership within Atrium Health, but also to help advance patient- centered, value-based care on a national basis - changing the healthcare equation to benefit patients and providers alike. Because so many neurological disorders are still incurable, we remain steadfast in pursuing treatments that offer patients new levels of hope. Our broad research program is closely integrated with our clinical work, providing patients access to advanced diagnostics, rigorous clinical care and emerging treatment options before they become widely available. Changing the therapeutic landscape With 12 neurology clinics, a large patient population and a team of committed researchers, we have been involved in dozens of groundbreaking investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored clinical trials over the past 20 years. Recent highlights include: Alzheimer's disease. The TOMMORROW Study, a large international trial with 50 sites, aims to uncover whether a biomarker combining age and gene variants can predict a person's disease risk. The study is led locally by Robert Mitchell, MD, medical director of neurology at Neurosciences Institute. Multiple sclerosis. We participated in the Phase 3 Oratorio OLE trial for ocrelizumab, which led to its being the first drug approved for progressive multiple sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Overcoming recruitment challenges posed by rare disease studies, our MediciNova trial has enrolled 70 patients with ALS to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ibudilast. We have also enrolled 400+ patients in the MDA registry for patients with ALS, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular dystrophy.56% rise in active trials in 2016 23 Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute 24Our Educational Mission Neurosciences Institute is committed to shaping the future of neuroscience care through our educational mission. This mission is carried out in three primary areas: 26Educating a New Generation of Surgeons Our clinical experts amplify their positive impact on patient care through training the next generation of surgical leaders. The Neurological Surgery Residency Program at Carolinas Medical Center is a nationally recognized program designed to educate neurosurgeons dedicated to clinical innovation, medical education and neuroscience research. Our faculty's research is routinely published in major journals and presented at national and international scientific forums.
