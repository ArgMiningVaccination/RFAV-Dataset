The foundational concept for energy healing is that humans have an invisible body of \"life force energy\". This life force energy can be improved through the healer's hands either physically on or above the body, to restore and redirect someone back to optimal flow. This creates an elevated emotional state and an increase in general wellbeing. Studies have shown it is effective in reducing stress levels and healing from physical injuries.
