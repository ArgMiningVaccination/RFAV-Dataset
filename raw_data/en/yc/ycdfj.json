About one -tenth of Arizona is forested, one -fourth is woodland, one-fourth is grassland, and the rest is desert shrub. Elevations above 6,000 to 7, 000 feet host forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa ), topped in the highest areas From 4,500 to 7, 500 feet in the northern half of the state, pi\u00f1on pine (Pinus spp .) and chaparral grow between 4,000 and 6,0 00 feet in the central mountains. Plains grasses cover about one -third of the Colorado Plateau, and Sonoran or desert grass lands carpet the higher elevations of the basins. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) trees and shrubs have invaded many historical grasslands in the south ern part of Arizona . Cacti grow throughout the state, with the greatest varie ty below 2,000 feet . Foothills in the Tucson -Phoenix area carry giant saguaro cacti (Carnegia gigantea ) of the Sonoran Desert, matched in areas of the northwest Basin and Range Province by d ramatic stands of Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia ). Shrubs dominate the lowest portions (Artemesia tridentata bush (Larrea tridentata ) in the Basin and Range. Land ownership within Arizona is also quite diverse. Federal and state agencies and Native American Tribes manage the majority of lands with only a small portion (13%) being privat ely owned. The Forest Action Plan (F AP) is truly reflective of this diverse land base and draws on the strong relationships with many organizations and agencies. This collaborative \"all lands\" approach for the FAP is critical for successful near -term and long -term positive outcomes on the la ndscape. The development of the FAP was prompted by federal legisla tive requirements. The amended Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as the Farm Bill) added new requirements for the states to identify priority forest landsca pe areas (i.e., a statewide assessment of forest resources) and highlight work needed to address national, region al, and state forest management priorities (i.e., a statewide forest resource strategy). States were required to comp lete a Forest Action Plan in order to qua lify for funds under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act (CFAA). The CFAA funds are provided to states through the State and Private Forestry (S&PF) program of the USDA Forest Service. Currently, A rizona receives several million dollars annually to protect communities at risk from wildfire, assist private for est landowners, promote sound forest practices, and assist communities with their urban forests. Most of the CFAA funding rece ived by the Arizon a Department of Forestry and Fire Mana gement (DFFM ) is provided as grants to local organizati ons that provide matching funds and additional planning and implementation resources. The combination of stat e and local efforts, along with coordination and collaboration with federal, tribal and othe r lan d management agencies, provides substantial leveraging of CFAA funds to benefit Arizona forests , woodlands, and citizens. The responsibility for developing the Forest Action Plan be longs to the State Forester and DFFM. The State Forester appointed a task group with diverse representation to work with agency staff to develop the final Arizona Forest Resource Assessment and Arizona Forest Resource Strategy , and both documents were completed in June 2010. pg. 5 The Farm Bill requires states to review their F orest Action Plans every 5 years . In 2015, DFFM created the Status Report and Addendum in which the implementation of Arizona's Forest Action Plan since 2010 was summarized. The State and Private Forestry Board introduced new \"National Priorities\" and required that they be included in state Forest Action Plans . As such, an Addendum was made to the Forest Action Plan, which provided an overview of the implementation summarized by the three National Priorities. This document, the 2020 FAP, is the 10-year update to the original Forest Action Plans completed in 2010. While the 2010 Assessment and Strategy focused on forests and woodlands e xclusively, the FAP take s an \"all lands\" approach and expand its scope to include the entirety of the state of Arizona. This approach has allowed for more collaboration, which lead to a better evaluation of Ar izona's natural resources , threats to those resources and strategies to address these threats. As described in the Assessment Methodology and Outreach section, the 2020 update included and stakeholder review and edit. However, even though the FAP has cha nged and expanded some of the original ideas of the 2 010 Forest Action Plan, it stays true to the basic principles identified early in the process: 1. Build upon a strong collaborative foundation 2. Use and leverage existing work to the fullest extent possible 3. Develop a strong framework for future work Overview of Issues The 2020 FAP, like the 2010 FAP organized the critical resource issues in to eight major categories: 1. People and Landscapes 2. Ecosystem Health 3. Water 4. Air 5. Fire 6. Economics 7. Climate Change 8. Culture As issues were identified, evaluated and classified, it became clear there were three overarching needs that cut across all of the issues: 1. Funding to accomplish land management activities 2. Developing the capacity to c ollaboratively accomplish land management goals 3. Educating the public about natural resource management. It is clear that various aspects of funding, capacity and education must be considered as strategies are developed and implemented and priority/focus areas addressed. Purposes and U ses The FAP puts forth a broad array of issues, goals, and necessary actions. In short, it attempt s to address key factors that natural resources affect as w ell as key factors that affect natural resources. It also addresses the three national th emes outli ned in the Farm Bill: 1. Conserve working forestlands, 2. Protect forests from harm, 3. Enhance public benefits from trees and forests. The FAP provides the following information as a foundation: An analy sis of present and future conditions, trends, and threats on all ownerships in the state using publicly available information. pg. 6 Identification of natural resource related threats, benefits, and services consistent with the Farm Bill national themes. An analysis of how to incorporat e existing statewide pl ans, including Wildlife Action P lans and Community Wildfire Protection P lans, and planning for existing State Forestry programs and initiatives. Outlines long -term coordinated approaches for addressing resource issues and opportuniti es in priority landscapes. Describes how the state proposes to invest federal funding and other resources to address state, regional, and national management priorities. Identifies key partners and stakeholders for future program, agency, and partner coord ination. Incorporates existing statewide plans including the State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) and Community Wildfire Protection P lans (CWPP), and Discusses the resources necessary for implementation. It is intended that the plan be implemented using a \"Shared \" approach whereby projects and programs are effectively implemented across multiple ownerships and jurisdictions. Given the themes and broad components, the FAP lends itself to a wide variety of applications that go beyond the state level . Conclusion Natural resources in Arizona, regardless of ownership, are national treasures and it is impossible to measure their values with dollars and cents. They provide a variety of critical ecosystem goods and services. However, the demands and press ures on our forests , woodlands, etc. are increasing in Arizona and nationwide , presenting challenges . The FAP will provide steps that will assist a variety of partners and stakeholders in: 1. Taking actions that will better address priority issues 2. Receiving funding based on a broadly supported, effectively designed approach es 3. Improving communication, collaborati on, and leveraging of resources 4. Successfully implementing projects, programs, and initiatives across landscapes involving multiple ownerships 5. Enhancing th e capacity of Arizona's landscapes to provide life -giving ecosystem services and products such as clean water, clean air, recreational experiences, traditi onal and non -traditional natural products, and quality habitat for wildlife. pg. 7 2.0 Introduction and Background Introduction The natural resources of Arizona are an invaluable asset vital to all the sta te's citizens. Arizona is more than the typical image of saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert. It is a land of diverse landscapes and dive rse forests. There is a n array of trees from the cottonwood -willow riparian forests and mesquite bosques hugging river courses to subalpine firs cloaking the tallest mountain peaks to paloverdes shading urban communities. To many, it comes as a surprise to learn Arizona has more than 19 million acres of forestlands . These forests provide substantial benefits of \"ecosystem services\" to the people of Arizona. Many of these goods and services are traditionally viewed as free benefits from nature to society. One of many examples of such an \"ecosystem servi ce\" is clean drinking water. According to the National Academies of Sciences , forests in the United States provide two -thirds of the nation's drinking water. This is an extremely critical function in an arid state undergoing rapid population growth. In 20 17, the Arizona census recorded over 7 million people and population projections suggest that this number will reach 12 million by 2050. Other ecosystem services provided by forests include wildlife habitats, clean air, recreation, and renewable energy. The management of lands within Arizona is very diverse. Federal and state agencies along with Native American Tribes manage most of Arizona's lands. Only a small portion is owned privately. Different federal agencies have responsibility for specific lands including the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service , US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation . The Bureau of Indian Affairs assists certain tribes with the managem ent of tri bal lands. There are also areas under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense (e.g., Fort Huachuca in Cochise County) . These multiple ownerships can create substantial complexi ty when trying to address natural resource issues on a larger scale that affect lands under different ownerships o r jurisdictions in the same region of the state. Thus, it is critical to develop and draw upon strong relationships with many organizations and agencies for any statewide assessment or strategy to be truly reflective o f this diverse land base. C ollaboration will be critical to both the short -term and l ong-term success of land management activities in our state . Collaborative processes are all the more crucial since v ast areas of the 20 million acres of Arizona's land is unhealthy and vulnerable to unnatural fire due to a ccumulated fuels and ongoing drought. In 2002, the catastrophic Rodeo -Chediski Fire burned 470,000 acres, destroyed mor e than 400 homes, and threatene d many others. C ontainment and suppression costs exceeded $50 million as well as other immeasurable costs of rebuilding t he communities and restoring ecosystems that were destroyed. With the suppression first mentality of land managers over the past 100 ye ars future wildfires of this scale and severity are just as if not even more likely to occur. The challenge of addressing these threats is compounded by Arizona's rapidly inc reasing population and limited state and municipal budgets. This stark reality h elps to further emphasize the need to set funding priorities according to which landscapes and ecosystems are most critical. It also brings to light again the importance of collaboration with agenc ies, organizations, and citizens . Such approaches are being emphasized across all sectors of government and funding in the United States. It is our intent that we make the best use of limited dollars to meet the greatest needs f or Arizona's citizens and natural resources through the implementation of the strategie s in this document . Arizona will be better positioned to improve funding, demonstrate results and achieve priority outcomes. pg. 8 Background Farm Bill and Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act Commonly referred to as the Farm Bill, the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 was enacted on June 19, 2008. This leg islation amended the Cooperative Forestry Ass istance Act of 1978 and required each state to complete a statewide forest resource assessment and a statewide forest resource strategy to receive, or con tinue to receive, federal funds under the Cooperative Forestry Ass istance Act (CFAA). The CFAA funds are provided to states through the State and Private Forestry (S&PF) section of the USDA Forest Service (USFS). Currently, Arizona receives several millio n dollars annually to protect communities from wildfire, assist private forest landowners, promote healthy forest practices, and assist communities with their urban forests. Most CFAA funding received by the Arizo na Department of Forestry and Fire Manageme nt (DFFM ) is passed through to local organizations by way of grants that require matching funds and additional implementation resources. The combination of state and local efforts along with coordination and collaboration with federal, tribal, and other la nd management agencies provides substantial leveraging of these fun ds to benefit Arizona natural resources and citizens. To receive CFAA funding, the 2008 legislation also requires that states focus on landscape -level outcomes to achieve national private forest conservation priorities. These priorities, which are a result of the \"redesign\" effort within the S&PF section of t he USFS, include: Conserve working forest landscapes Protect forests from threats Enhance public benefits from trees and forests The amended CFAA of 2008 also requires states to identify priority forest landscape areas and highlight work needed to ad dress national, regional, and state forest management priorities. Federal Guidance The National Association of State Foresters (NASF) and US Forest Service S&PF collaborated to provide specific guidance to states beyond what was provided in legislation. Their guidance identifies the following minimum requirements for the Resource Assessment: Provide an analysis of present and future forest conditions, trends, and threats on all ownerships in the state using publicly available information. Identify fores t-related threats, benefits, and services consistent with the S&PF Redesign national themes. Delineate priority rural and urban forest landscape areas to be addressed by the state forest resource strategy. Work with neighboring states and governments to identify any multi -state areas that are a regional priority. Incorporate existing statewide plans, including Wildlife Action plans and Community Wildfire Protection P lans, and address existing S&PF program planning requirements. Forest Resource Strate gy, Annual Reporting, and Updates pg. 9 The Strategy was developed as a separate companion document to this Assessment and, where possible, complemented other state and federal agency assessment and planning work. Both the Assessment and the Strategy for Arizon a were completed in 2010. The Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management (DFFM), beginning in 2011, required reporting of accomplishments . Reporting included info rmation about activities of DFFM as well as activities of other agencies and organizations working toward common forest resource objectives and outcomes. The 2008 Farm Bill requires states to update their Forest Action Plan every five years or as required by th e Secretary of Agricultu re. DFFM completed the required update of the Arizona Forest Action Plan in 2015. The document summarized the implementation of the Arizona Forest Action Plan since the plans ' development in 2010 . The update also supplied an overview of the implementation that was required by the three National Priorities section . The 2015 Forest Action Plan update, titled: 2015 Status Report and Addendum, was a report on the 2010 Arizona Forest Resource Assessment and Strategy and not an actual update of the Forest Action Plan. However , the 2015 Addendum satisfied the requirements of the 2008 Farm Bill a nd a full update of the plan was required by 2020. This update , The Arizona Forest Action Plan (FAP ), was completed in 2018 an d expanded the scope beyond forests to all lands capes in Arizona. The Strategy and Assessment from the 2010 Forest Action have now been combined in the FAP. pg. 10 3.0 Assessment Methodology and Outreach Though some of the methodologies have changed the basic principles identified for the original Arizona Natural Resource Assessment, still govern how the assessment portion of the FAP was prepared: 1. Build upon a strong collaborative foundation. The management of lands within Arizona is very diverse. Federal and state agencies along with Native Ameri can Tribes manage most Arizona land s (83%) . Only a small portion is privately owned . For any assessment or strategy to be truly reflective of this diverse land base, it must take an \"all -lands\" approach. It is imperative to continue to develop and draw upon strong relationships with many or ganizations and agencies. Collaboration is critical to both the short -term and l ong-term success of land management . 2. Use and leverage existing work to the fullest extent possible. Substantial assessment and planning work has already been completed in Arizona by many federal and state agencies, non - governmental organizations, academic institutions, and collaborative groups . This existing work should be relied on wherever possible, and not duplicated. 3. Develop a strong framework for future work. The short -term requirements for development of the Assessment will be met, but more importantly, these documents need to be flexib le enough to continue to be refined and develop ed over time. As additional resources are applied and new information developed, the Assessment and Strategy will be refined and strengthened. A strong framework for this future work is critical. 3.1 Issue Work Groups Eight (8) issue work groups were assembled for each of the resource issues ide ntified in the previous Forest Action Plans. These issue work groups were led by one or more Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management staff to update the 2010 Forest Action Plan Assessment and Strategy with the above principles in mind. The composition of many existing collaborative organizations were leveraged to keep the size of the groups manageable. Representation was sought from all of the largest land management agencies and organizations, statewide council s and collaborative groups, the statewide academic community, and non -governmental organizations in order to build a strong collaborative plan. Each work group in the 2020 update provided comments to their specific resource issue in the Forest Action Plan and collaborated to complete updates or retain sections as is. Work groups met monthly to discuss each resource issue and the related goals and objectives from the 2010 plan. An online platform (Base camp) was used to communicate with stakeholders and record plan revisions. The groups included representation from these key agencies: Arizona Commerce Authority - The Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) is the leading economic development organization with a streamlined mission to grow and strengthen Arizona's economy. The ACA uses a threepronged approach to advance the overall economy: recruit, grow, create - recruit outofstate companies to expand their operations in Arizona; work with existing companie s to grow their business in Arizona and beyond; and collaborate with entrepreneurs and companies large and small to create new jobs and businesses in targeted industries. Arizona Department of Environmental Quality - ADEQ is a separate, cabinetlevel agenc y that directs all of Arizona's environmental protection programs. ADEQ's mission is to protect and enhance public health and the environment in Arizona. The department does this by overseeing the state's environmental laws and authorized federal programs to prevent pollution of the air, water, and land, and to ensure cleanup of such pollution when it occurs. ADEQ's goal is to lead Arizona and the nation in protecting and enhancing the environment and improving the quality pg. 11 of life for the people of our sta te. The agency helps Arizonans respect the balance between the natural world and the people who depend on it for sustenance, prosperity and a fulfilling quality of life. Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management - Responsible for implementation of cooperative forestry programs as well as wildland fire suppression and management on approximately 22 million acres of state and private land ou tside incorporated communities . The agency provides services for fire prevention, urban and community forestry, forest stewardship, forest health, utilization and marketing, and has a wide v ariety of grants available. DFFM works closely with the US Forest Service and other partners to implement a variety of cooperative forestry and fire management programs authoriz ed under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act. Arizona Department of Transportation - The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) is a multimodal transportation agency serving one of the fastestgrowing areas of the country. ADOT is responsible f or planning, building and operating a complex highway system in addition to building and maintaining bridges and the Grand Canyon Airport. A major component of the organization is the Motor Vehicle Division, which provides title, registration and driverli cense services to the public throughout the state of Arizona. The people, who purchase fuel, drive or own private and commercial vehicles, or use transportation services fund ADOT. To build and operate the state's transportation systems, individuals and bu sinesses invest money through fuel taxes, motorcarrier fees and vehicle title, registration and license fees. Arizona Game and Fish Department - The mission of the Arizona Game and Fish Department is to conserve Arizona's diverse wildlife resources and ma nage for safe, compatible outdoor recreation opportunities for current and future generations.

The Southwestern Region is 20.6 million acres. There are six national forests in Arizona, 5 national forests and a national grassland in New Mexico, and one national grassland each in Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. Th e region ranges in elevation from 1,600 feet above sea level and an annual rainfall of 8 inches in Arizona's lower Sonoran Desert to 13,171foot high Wheeler Peak and over 35 inches of precipitation a year in northern New Mexico. USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service - A federal agency providing both technical and financial assistance to private and tribal landowners for the conservation of natural resources and the environment. The conservation delivery system is a collaborative effort with Arizon a's 41 Natural Resource Conservation D istricts (NRCDs) . Participation of NRCS staff on the issue groups , along with other direct communications, reinforced the important link with the State Technical Advisory Committee (an NRCS lead organization that provi des recommendations to carry out conservation provisions of the Farm Bill). USDI Bureau of Land Management - A federal multiple -use agency that administers 12.2 million surface acres of public land (five national monuments, three national conservation ar eas, two national historic trails, a portion of a national scenic trail, 47 wilderness areas and two wilderness study areas), and another 17.5 million subsurface (mineral) acres within the state. The BLM balances recreational, commercial, scientific, and c ultural interests while striving for long -term protection of renewable and nonrenewable resources, including range, timber, minerals, recreation, watersheds, fish and wildlife, wilderness, wild horses and burros, and natural, scenic, scientific, and cultur al values. Direction for management of public land administered by the BLM can be found in approved land use plans. USDI Fish and Wildlife Service - The Arizona Ecological Services Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service works with public and privat e partners to protect federally listed endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, freshwater fish, and wildlife habitat in Arizona. The Service implements all facets of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), including listing, recovery, and delisting o f native flora and fauna. It also works with the various land management agencies to ensure that their projects are in compliance with the ESA. Western Forestry Leadership Coalition - The Western Forestry Leadership Coalition represents a unique partnershi p between the Council of Western State Foresters and federal government forestry leaders. The Coalition is comprised of 34 members from across the federal and state agencies of the west. pg. 15 4.0 Incorporation of Other Plans State and federal agencies, non -profit organizations, academic institutions, and collaborative groups have completed considerable analysis and planning work to address natural resource issues in Arizona. A large portion of the FAP is built upon these earli er activities. The following information provides an overview about many of the documents that were published and relied upon in the development of the FAP. The Farm Bill legislation requires integration of several of these documents. However, many Arizon a efforts go beyond the national norms and it is important that these works be incorporated. Likewise, since there are many planning efforts still ongoing, this list will likely grow substantially with time. 4.1 Existing Arizona Planning Arizona Departme nt of Forestry and Fire Management Strategic Plan This guiding document lays out the goals for the next five -year period to better serve our Arizona communities and ensure the safety of the public. The mission of the plan is to manage and reduce fire risk to protect Arizona's people, communities, and wildland areas. Secondly, the plan aims to champion the health of Arizona's natural resources while providing service through strategic implementation of cooperative natural resources and fire assistance progra ms, development and support of statewide fire policies, and coordination of resources across all -lands and jurisdictions. There are seven goals identified in the strategic plan: Educate Public and Cooperators, Strong Forest Industry, Healthy Forests, Woodl ands and Watersheds, Fire and Hazard Safe Communities - Wildlands, Fire and Hazard Safe Communities - All Hazard, Fire and Hazard Safe Communities - Structural, and Organizational Excellence and Efficiency. Arizona Urban & Community Forestry Plan As the g uiding document for Arizona's Urban & Community Forestry (UCF) Program, this plan describes goals, objectives, and actions for a five -year period in the areas of education, public awareness, volunteerism, technical assistance, a nd financial assistance. T his five -year plan is an important guiding document for review of program accomplishments and enables Arizona to receive Federal funding for UCF program efforts. The plan also describes the advisory relationship between the Arizona Community Tree Council and the State Forester in supp ort of the DFFM 's Urban & Community Forestry Program. Community Wildfire Protection Plans The Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 authorized the creation of community wildfire protection plans (CWPP). Loca l stakeholders write CWPPs that include an evaluation of local conditions and risks from fire, and development of a plan to address all aspects of community protection and wildfire mitigation. A strategic plan as well as an action plan, the CWPP generates a broad operating fr amework for landowners and resource managers within the area and identifies community protection priorities. A combination of fuel management, FireWise standards, and appropriate wildfire suppression response across ownerships within and adjacent to at -risk communities will reduce threats to life and property, protect values -at-risk, and create a safe context for the use of fire in subsequent ecosystem restoration efforts. Site -specific planning and implementation remains the responsibility of each owner/ma nagement agency, generally operating within the guidelines developed by a CWPP. More than 27 CWPPs or equivalent plans have been developed and approved throughout Arizona. pg. 16 Forest Legacy Program Assessment of Need Developed for DFFM by The Nature Conserv ancy of Arizona, the Forest Legacy Program Assessment of Need (AON) outlines the Forest Legacy Program in Arizona and includes eligibility criteria, project selection guidelines, and a definition of priority areas. The original AON was developed in 2005, r eviewed in 2016, and updated in 2020 to remain consistent with the 2017 Forest Legacy Program Implementation Guidelines. The Forest Legacy Program is a USDA Forest Service program delivered through the DFFM for identifying and protecting environmentally important forest areas from conversion to non -forest uses through the acquisition of conservation easements. The AON is in this Assessment by reference and is included in the appendices. National Forest Stewardship Program Standards and Guidelines The pur pose of this document is to \"encourage the long -term stewardship of important State and private forest landscapes, by assisting landowners to more actively manage their forest and related resources.\" A major component of this program is a spatial analys is of forest resource management threats and opportunities, used to delineate priority areas for delivering State & Private Forestry programs. The Forest Stewardship important forest resource areas map created for these priority areas were included in the 201 0 Assessment , thus any updated versions will be as well. State Wildlife Action Plan The Arizona Game and Fish Department updated the State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP), in 2012 . This diverse and comprehensive planning effort included outreach and coordination, landscape - focused and species -focused conservation planning, identification of Species and Habitats of Greatest Conservation Need, assessment of stressors and threats to wildlife and their habitats, prioritization of conservation strategies a nd actions, and a prescription detailing the need for monitoring and adaptive management. The SWAP will be reviewed and revised /updated within a 10-year timeframe. pg. 17 5.0 Arizona Conditions and Trends 5.1 Overview of Arizona 's Forests Arizona 's forests range from riparia n gallery forests along low desert rivers to sub -alpine and montane forests above 9,000 feet in elevation1. Forests cover roughly 27% of the state and occupy 19.4 million acres. These forests are comprised of 37 species of coniferous and hardwood trees. The majorit y of forestland is located north of the Mogollon Rim with several distinct areas scattered throughout the rest of the state. Juniper and pinyon -juniper woodlands are the most abundant forest type in Arizona, occupying approximately 14.8 million acres, or 20.3% of the state. The rarest and most significant in ecological terms is riparian forest, which occupies less than one -half of 1% o f Arizona's land. Pre-European Settlement Vegetation and Climate Today's for ests reflect a long series of climatic and corresponding vegetative change s in Arizona. A paleoecological study in the Potato Lake area of the southern Colorado Plateau (approximately 7,300 feet in elevation) suggests dramatic changes occurred in the area' s bio ta during the last 35,000 years2. From 35,000 to 21,000 years before present (B.P.), it appears the area was dominated by mixed conifer species, suggesting the climate was cooler a nd wetter than it is today. The years 21,000 to 10,400 B.P. were likely the regions coldest period glaciation, Engelmann spruce ( Picea engelmannii ) formed almost pure growing as low as 8,200 feet. Today, this spruce is generally located above 10,800 feet. During this period, average temperatures were several degrees cooler than they are today. The transition into the Pleistocene -Holocene Epoch, and the end of the last glacial period resulted in a major restructuring of southern Colorado Plateau vegetation. On Utah's Markagunt Plateau, species com mon in today's mixed - conifer forests moved upslope to their current elevation range. A warmer, drier climate likely resulted in the widespread establishment of ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) across mid -elevations of the area. elevations between 5,200 and 6,900 feet, pinyon -juniper woodlands dominated. In the period that followed (8,000 to 4,000 B.P.), pinyon -juniper woodlands migrated into the area and warm desert grasses replaced cold desert species . In lower elevation regions of the Colorado Plateau, studies from the Chaco Canyon and San Juan Basins in New Mexico and Arizona showed canyons were dominated by mixed conifer forests and mesa tops were cold desert steppe3. Fire In Southwest ern forests, lightning -caused and human -caused fires could burn f or several months and cover thousands of acres, burning until extinguished by r ain or depletion of fuel4. Dendrochronology research suggests most Southwest forest stands, excluding spruce -fir, burned every 2 to 30 years as low - 1 O'Brien, R.A. 2002. Arizona's Forest Resources, 1999.

Havi ng greater moisture, yet heavier fuel loads, spruce -fir forests burned less frequently, approximately every 35 to 150 years or more, but at higher intensities5. Although Native American cultures used fire for a variety of purposes, lightning ignitions duri ng periods of high fire hazard were sufficient to produ ce frequent fires6. Historic Conditions Environmental conditions as well as ecological processes above and below groun d influenced the pattern of vegetation distribution . Ponderosa pine forests in the early nineteenth century were predominantly open with a diverse community of trees, shrubs, and perennial grasse s and forbs7. Historic ponderosa pine forests are referred to as open and park -like with abundant herbaceous understory, although descriptions and pictures of dense stands have al so been documented8. Records and archaeological reconstruction of historic ponderosa pine forest conditions suggest individual , clumped, or stringers of ponderosa pine in various sizes an understory grass -herbaceous matrix9 characterized the vegetation . The development of fire -dependent vegetation coupled with the climate conditions that existed several centuries prior to 1848 reinforced a frequent -fire regime of low -intensity burns . Frequent surface fires, disease, insects, and other regulating mechanisms maintained the balance and resilience of ponderosa pine forests in Arizona. Conditions in historic mixed conifer forests were variable and depended on burn history. Characteristics of a mixed conifer forest in the early 1900's are described as follows: Because spruce -fir forests were largely unaffected by logging, livestock grazin g or fire suppression, their historic conditions are fairly w ell known10. Spruce -fir forests were susceptible to major disturbances (i.e., fire and insect outbreak) but disturbance occurred relatively infrequently, typically with 100 or more years between m ajor events11. 5 Abolt, R.A.P. 1997.

The y describe most mature Douglas fir (as well as white fir and blue spruce) as \"deteriorating;\" they probably mean these trees were decayed, had poor crown form, broken tops, and hollow bases typical of repeatedly fire -damaged trees. Lang and Stewart also no te that Douglas -fir regeneration was \"healthy and vigorous;\" and often dense stands of pole -sized trees covered large areas, especially on more mesic sites and under aspen.\" pg. 19 Riparian areas in Arizona once formed continuous corridors of lush vegetation stretching for hundreds of miles. They extended from the montane headwaters of rivers and streams down to river corridors across low-elevation deserts. Many plant species in riparian communities depend on seasonal flooding for seed trans portation and establishment, high groundwater levels for saturated soils , and dense vegetation for ecosystem health. Riparian communities provided resources necessary for early human settlements, as well as permanent wildlife habitat and migratory routes for birds and mammals. Post -European Settlement The arrival of Europeans had a devastating effect on Native American populations, and produced significant environmental changes including; livestock grazing, logging and mining , dams and irrigation, and the introduction of diseases affecting wildlife. The period following the Mexican -American War of 1848 marked a significant transition from Mexican to American sovereignty in the Southwest and a time of rapid settlement. With increased settlement came domestic livestock. In fact, by 1890, more than 1.5 million head of cattle were in t he Southwest12. By the early 1900s, grazing pressure from cattle and sheep had reached the timbered mountains, resulting in loss of vegetative co ver and increased erosion. After a peak in the numbers of cattle and sheep in Arizona around the time of World War I, liv estock numbers decline d following a severe drought in the 1950s . Today, livestock numbers are in line with the carrying capacity of the land, and many ranches are stocked conservatively. In some areas, h istoric fire regimes have changed because livestock removed much of the fine fuel needed to carry surface fires and be cause fire suppression was instituted due to the growing number of inhabitants who vie wed fire as a threat. However, ultimately, the frequency and size of fires was altered by a combination of factors - road and trail establishment, fragmentation of forest continuity, increased ignition sources, suppression of fires, and altered fuel loads. Fire suppression and exclusion began altering plant community structure an d fire regimes in the early 1900s13. During the last century, the combination of past fire suppression and subsequent f uel accumulation has led to an increase in the frequency of large and intense fires, such as those experienced in the last several decades in the Southwest. Some forecasts indicate a warming climate will lead to at least a doubling of annual area burned in Arizona by the late twenty -first century14. With the arrival of railroads in the Southwest, new industries appeared, human population gre w, natural resource use accelerated, and a commercial economy replaced the subsistence economy. Some other concurrent changes included altered land use and ownership patterns, depletion of forage by domestic livestock, degradation of woodland and riparian areas, and changes in wildlife h abitat15. Arizona has continued a rapid growth tre nd, further stressing natural ecosystems and resources. Small - scale logging for local -use shifted to larger efforts around the 1870s with constructio n of the railroad and 12 Baker, R.D., R.S. ell, V.H. Treat, and H.C. Dethloff. 1988.

During these early years, a large volume of trees (70-80% in some cases ) nee ded to be remov ed from the forests to make railroad op eration s feasible16. Later, when trucks became availa ble, lighter cuts could be made typically from 30% to 60% of the availabl e wood volume17. With time, logging methods have been variable with some practices being more sustainable than others. Removal of large, quality trees (i.e., high grading) has resulted in dense stands of second - growth trees, thus reducing understory herbaceous cover and increasing fire dang er. The transcontinental railroad also provided increased opportunities for tourism. Arizona's mild climate, striking archaeological ruins, and majestic scenery all led to a tremendous increase in recreation during the mid - to late -1900s. Arizona became a favorite destination for hunting, fishing, sightseeing, and bird watching. Preservation and conservation of forests and other natural communities became a focal point for citizens and public land managers. Higher visitation to remote areas and forest comm unities led to overuse and exploitation of resources, introduction of non -native plants and animals, increased human - caused fires, and unauthorized use of motorized vehicles. Climat e change is another factor that has altered the stat e's forests. Recent stu dies indicate a warming climate has changed forest fire regimes, and is projected to continue to increase the frequency, size, and s easonal length of forest fires18, thereby shifting the dominance and abundance of plant species across Arizona and the West. Additionally, t hese and other interrelated chan ges throughout Arizona have altered the hydrologic function of most watersheds. Soil compaction, road construction, and reduced ground cover have led to increased erosion and flooding, often resulting in deep , incised channels referred to as gullies . Water diversions and impoundments of larger rivers have significantly modified channel dynamics, and altered habitat and vegetation establishment within the reservoirs and downstream riparian areas. To address bank stabilization and other soil stability problems, species not native to ecosystems of the Southwest, such as salt cedar ( Tamarix spp.), were introduced to help address these problems and provide bank protection . Many of these introdu ced species are now co nsidered invasive, and continue to have detrimental effects on ecosystem processes. Current Forest Types and Distribution Despite all these problems and concerns, the conditions and diversity of Arizona's forests remains impressive. Some of southern Arizona's forested landscapes have reached international importance because of their outstanding biological diversity. They are part of the \"Madrean Archipelago,\" which Conservation International has recently added to its list of world biodiversity hotspots (B iodiversity Hotspots). Their significant biological diversity stems from a convergence of subtropical and temperate climatic zones, which create forest refugia and corridors for many unique animals, including the jaguar onca ) and thick -billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha Forest Inventory and Program (FIA) classifies forestlands into two general categorie s\u2014 timberland or woodland based on levels of tree stocking. Timberland is forestland where tree spe cies traditionally used for industrial roundwood products, such as ponderosa pine and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzie sii), make up at least 10% of the stocking. Only 20% of Arizona's forestland meet s 16 Schubert, G.H. 1974. Silviculture of southwestern ponderosa pine: the status of our knowle dge. Research Paper RM-123.

The remaining portion is woodland, whi ch indicates forestland where timber species are not present at the minimum 10% stocking level. Woodland tree species, such as pinyon and juniper, are used primarily for fuelwood, fence posts, and, in some cases, Christmas trees (e.g. pinyon pine) . Forestl ands are further differentiated into forest types and are often identified by the predominant tree species. Beyond these traditional forest definitions are Arizona's urban and community f orests \u2014a rapidly expanding landscape of trees and vegetation which pr ovides healthier, more livable urban environments. Vegetation communities have been described using a variety of classifications and different geographical scales. Because planning and management objectives differ, the framework selected to identify ecological units is different, as are the resultant classifications. Most forestlands in Arizona are within the Arizona/New Mexico Mountains or Plateau Ecoregions20. Southwestern ecosystems are further grouped into life zones21, which are characterized by biotic community types and can be cross -referenc ed to the biotic communities . 19 O'Brien, R.A. 2002.

Acreages of traditional forest types Class Acres Aspen enough data exists to quantify the types and species of vegetation that make up Arizona's urban forests pg. 22 Arizona Forests and Woodlands Aspen pg. 23 Trembling or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides ) ranges in occurrence from small discontinuous patches of tens to hundreds of acres to large, contiguous stands of thousands of acres) at elevations ranging from 5,500 feet to 11,500 feet. Aspen is a seral species in several coniferous habitat types, including spruce -fir and mixed conifer habitat types and mesic ponderosa pine forest, and in montane grasslands with fire exclusion or after heavy livestock grazing. Aspen can originate on scree slopes or active talus, where it forms small stands that are relatively persistent. Aspen can also occur as a stable or persistent forest type, but this type is most common in Utah and Colorado. Aspen occurs throughout North America, with greater abundance in the northern Rocky Mountain States and Ca nadian provinces, for which there is a rich literature. However, fewer studies have been published for aspen as it occurs in the Southwest. Aspen is very important from a biodiversity standpoint, either supporting many species of birds and mammals directly as forage, indirectly through the vast insect community it supports , or through the provision of structural habitat or nesting sites. Some consider asp en second only to riparian stands in biodiversity value (Smith 2006a). Mixed Conifer Forests Varietie s of conifer species are dominant at higher elevations in mountainous regions (above approximately 7,800 ft.). At elevations between 7,800 and 10,200 ft., forests are domin ated by Douglas - fir, ponderosa pine present the lower end of those elevations. The spruce -fir forest is Abies lasiocarpa ) in cooler regions and areas receiving more than 25 inches of annual precipitation. Other species present in mixed conifer forests include corkbark fir ( A. lasiocarpa var aspen. The mildest climate in Arizona is found in mixed conifer forests, with average annual precipitation from 14 to 30 inches, with as much as 44 inches a t higher elevations . More than half of the precipitation falls as snow and mean annual temperatur e ranges from 41 to 47 degrees fare height22. Pine -Oak Pine -oak is made up of two principal types: pine -oak forests where oaks are common or co -dominant in mixed conifer or ponderosa forests at higher elevations, and evergr een oak woodlands where oaks dominate with a mix of con ifers. This latter type occurs at mid to higher elevations (2,900 to 9,500 ft.) throughout forested areas of Arizona. The pine -oak forest type is found as patches or broad bands of mostly Gambel oak ( Q. gambelii ) throughout the mixed conifer and ponderosa forest types. Evergreen (Madrean) oak woodland is prominent in southeastern Arizona and generally includes a diversity of evergreen oak species as well as conifers. Most of the se woodlands are found in the \"sky islands\" of southeastern Arizona at elevations from 3,900 t o 8,800 feet. They typically occupy the life zone above the desert shrub and grassland commu nities and below the conif erous forest . At lower elevations, oak woodlands are typically open with bunch grasses as the major understory component. At higher elevat ions, they are denser forests with oak and pine species intermixed. In Arizona, a variety of oak species --Emory oak ( Q. emoryi ), Arizona white oak Q. rugosa ) grow at higher elevations in conjunction with Madrean pi ne species, such as Apache pine (Pinus 22 USDA 2004b. Ecological Site Descriptions, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Ari zona. Accessed 2004. pg. 24 engelmannii ), Chihuahua pine ( ). Arizona cypress, endemic to woodlands , is confined mainly to north -facing canyon slopes and drainages. If there is sufficient moisture, epiphytic bromeliads ( Tillandsia recurvata ) can be found on tree the common understory grasses include muhlys commonly found in the under story of many of these forests (Brown 199 4). The abundance of species from the interior chaparral community such as point leaf (Vauquelinia california ) can be occasional or frequent within the Madrean oak woodland. These and other indicative plants of chaparral are typically prominent on thin eroded soils, limestone, and near the eastern and northe rn range of the Madrean oak woodlands (Brown 1994). Annual precipitation in pine -oak ranges from 16 to 30 inches at the higher elevations. There is both snow and rain with winter -summer precipitation ratios about equal23. Snow seldom persists more than fe w days at the lowest elevations. Pinyon -Juniper Pinyon -juniper woodlands constitute the largest forest type in Arizona. These coniferous woodlands exist in a gradient of juniper -dominated -dominated woodlands with pinyon pine and junip er present throughout the range. They are found at elevations ranging from approximately 4,500 to 7,500 feet . Pinyon pine is the most common species in the complex with other pines including border pinyon ( Pinus lia). Juniper species are typically found at lower elevations than pinyons and at sites with dee per soils24. One -seed ( Juniperus below the Mogollon Rim. Other juniper species in Arizona include Rocky Mountain juniper ( ) and Utah juniper and alligator juniper ( J. deppeana ) in central and southern Arizona, although it is also associated with Madrean oak woodla nds 25. Understory vegetation is dependent primarily on rainfall and soil type. Herbaceous vegetation is the main understory component consisting of cool - and warm -season grasses including several of the and others provide the necessary forage for livestock and wildlife. Important shrubs in th e understory include cliffrose (Cowania mexicana ), ). Annual precipitation in the pinyon -juniper communities varies from 12 to 24 inches with occasional snow precipitation. With a few exceptions the topography of the pinyon -juniper woodlands are ge ntly rolling hills with slopes not likely to exceed 25% (USDA 2004a). 23 USDA 2004b.

Biotic Communities of the Southwestern United States a nd Northern Mexico. Salt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Press. pg. 25 Ponderosa Ponderosa pine is the most widely distributed pine in North America, extending from British Columbia, Canada to northern Mexico. Throughout its range, ponderosa pine can be f ound at elevations from near sea level to about 9,500 ft. Most ponderosa pine forest occurs in large contig uous patches throughout Arizona at elevations ranging from 5,500 feet to 8,500 feet. These relatively warm, dry forests are dominated by ponderosa pi ne, pinyon pine ( P. edulis, P. discolor junipers, and several oaks. Numerous grasses, Arizona squirrel tail and mountain muhly ( Muhlenbergia montana ), and a few shrubs make for a diverse ground cover. Ponderosa pine forest is typically bou nded at the upper elevation by mixed conifer forest and at the lower elevation by grassland, pinyon -juniper forest, or chaparral, although extensive intergrading of species may occur at ecotone s (boundaries along gradients of slope, elevation, aspect, and moisture ). Climatological data indicate that ponderosa pine forests occupy a wide moisture and temperature gradient, with annual precipitation ranging from 20 to 35 inches, and mean annual air temperatures ranging from 41\u00b0F to 52\u00b0F, which allows for a growing season of approximately 180 days (Smith 2006b). Riparian Forest Arizona's riparian ecosystems range from sea level to 10,000 feet. Riparian forests exist as a component of the forests and woodlands previously described, as well as within other ve getation communities at lower elevations, including semi -desert grasslands and the Mojave and Sonoran Desert. The vegetation found along river and stream riparian corridors depends on the availability of surface and ground water throughout the year, especi ally during the growing season. Some riparian forests are sustained by regulated water releases from upstream reservoirs. Factors such as elevation gradient, upland community, soil type and pr ecipitation make riparian forests highly variable in terms of the number and types of species. At the higher elevations, typical species species, ch as white fir and blue spruce. The understory is comprised of various shrubs, such elevations, a mixture of deciduous broadleaf spe cies, such velutina ), dominate the forest canopy. Many riparian forests at mid - to lower ele vations have been invaded by introduced salt cedar / tamarisk. Mesquite (Prosopis spp .) woodlands or bosques occupy many of the upper stream terraces at lower elevations. The climatic characteristics of riparian ecosystems exhibit a wide range of condition s due to large elevation differences and distributions of associated mountain ranges, highlands, and desert valleys. Riparian ecosystem topography can vary from narrow, deep, steep -walled canyon bottoms, to intermediately exposed sites with at least one te rrace or bench, to exposed, wide alluvial valleys with meandering streams. Urban and Community Forests While not traditionally considered a forest type, Arizona's u rban forests are comprised of trees and vegetation in urban areas that have a special relationship to people. Not enough data has been collected to quantify the types and species of vegetation that make up the urban forest, however, they are typically composed of a mix of native and exotic (introduced) tree species. In southern Arizona, native species include paloverde, ir onwood, and mesquite trees, with exotic s such as eucalyptus and various pines. Northern Arizona native trees are predominately ponderosa and pinyon -pine, oak and juniper, with pg. 26 several introduced species that can handle the cooler climate --elms, poplars, and spruce. It is important to note that several species planted for landscaping purposes can escape their original planting sites and invade other areas, with Russian olive ( being prime examples. The urban forest includes urban parks, street side trees, landscaped boulevards, public gardens, washes and wetlands, greenways, and nat ure preserves. However, since the majority of trees making up the urban forest are located on private property, urban forests are much larger than just these public tree components. 5.2 Arizona Ecoregions and Landscapes Ecoregions in the FAP are based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through analysis of the patterns and composition of biotic and abiotic factors that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity26. These factors include geology, physiography, vegeta tion, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level. Arizona ecoregions were derived from the Environmental Protection Age ncy (EPA)/Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) clas sification system27, which was derived from Omernik's framework . The EPA is using ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with its regional offices, state resource manag ement agencies, and other federal agencies to refine ecoregions, define sub regions , and locate sets of reference sites. Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management across jurisdictional boundaries, ecoregions denote area s within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. 26 Omernik, James M., 1995.

Potential natural vegetation in this region is predominantly creosote bush, as compared to the mostly saltbush -greasewood and Great Basin sagebrush of the ecoregion to the north, and creosote bush -bur sage with large patches of paloverde -cactus shrub and saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Basin and Range to the south. Most of this region is federally owned and managed by the BLM . Heavy use of off -road vehicles and motorcycles in some areas has caused severe wind and water erosion problems. Grazing is authorized on some State and Federal lands in the southern desert. ARIZONA/NEW MEXICO PLATEAU The Arizona/New Mexico Plateau represents a large transitional region between the semiarid grasslands and low relief tablelands of the Southwestern Tablelands ecoregion in the east, the drier shrublands and woodland covered higher relief tablelands of the Colorado Plateau in the north, and the lower, hotter, less vegetated Mojave Basin and Range in the west and Chihuahuan Deserts in the south. Higher, more forest covered, m ountainous ecoregions border the region on the northeast and southwest. Local relief in the region varies from a few feet on plains and mesa tops to well over 1,000 ft. along tableland side slopes. ARIZONA/NEW MEXICO MOUNTAINS The Arizona/New Mexico Mou ntains are distinguished from neighboring mountainous ecoregions by their lower elevations and an associated vegetation indicative of drier, warmer environments, which is also due in part to the region's more southerly location. Forests of spruce, fir, and Douglas fir , that are common in the Southern Rockies and the Uinta and Wasatch Mountains, are only found in a few high elevation parts of this region. Chaparral is common on the lower elevations, pinyon -juniper and oak woodlands are found on lower and mid dle elevations, and the higher elevations are mostly covered with open to dense ponderosa pine forests. CHIHUAHUAN DESERTS This desert ecoregion extends from the Madrean Archipelago in southeastern Arizona to the Edwards Plateau in south -central Texas. The region comprises broad basins and valleys bordered by sloping alluvial fans and terraces. Isolated mesas and mountains are located in the central and western parts of the region. Vegetative cover is predominantly arid -adapted grass es and shrub s, excep t on the higher mountains where oak -juniper woodlands occur. MADREAN ARCHIPELAGO Also known as the Sky Islands in the United States, this is a region of basins and ranges with medium to high local relief, typically 3,500 to 5,000 feet. Native vegetatio n in the region is mostly grama -tobosa - shrub steppe in the basins and oak -juniper woodlands on the ranges, except at higher elevations where ponderosa pine is predominant. The region has ecological significance as both a barrier and bridge between two majo r cordilleras of North America, the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Madre Occidental. pg. 28 SONORAN BASIN AND RANGE Similar to the Mojave Basin and Range to the north, this ecoregion contains scattered low mountains and has large trac ts of federally owned land, some of which is used for military training. However, the Sonoran Basin and Range is slightly hotter than the Mojave and contains large areas of palo verde -cactus shrub and giant saguaro cactus, whereas the potential natural vegetation in the Mojave is lar gely creosote bush. 5.3 Overview of Arizona's Grasslands Around the world, grassland ecosystems have great social, economic, and ecological value. Grasslands in Arizona have changed considerably o ver the last 130 years. 31% of the state's former grasslands are in good condition with native perennial grasses and low shrub cover 34% are shrub -invaded but have the potential to be restored 26% have crossed a threshold where former grasslands have transitioned to shrub land 9% are now dominated by exot ic species 4% have low shrub cover but also little to no perennial grass This data may underestimate the extent of grassland change, particularly for grasslands imbedded within pinyon -juniper woodland and ponderosa pine forest due to tree encroachment fro m long -term fire suppression. Arizona's grasslands are part of a large and diverse network of grasslands found throughout the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Semi -desert grasslands in central and southeastern Arizona extend into New Mexico and Sonor a, Mexico. Grasslands in n orthern Arizona share similarities with those found in the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Finally, high elevation grasslands, those in alpine areas and meadows interspersed within conifer fores ts, are found throughout most of the mountain ranges of northern Arizona and New Mexico. The grasslands in Arizona are g enerally found in semiarid climates with cold, dry winters and warm to hot summers with higher rainfall. Rainfall is seasonal with the majority of precipitation occurring during the summer with the arrival of monsoons. Since rainfall is seasonal across most of Arizona, many if not all of the grasslands experience seasonal drought. In some grassland areas, the total precipitation would be enough to support trees if it were more evenly distributed throughout the year. In many grasslands, fires is the key factor in the exclusion of trees and shrubs. Grassland Decline Human effects on grasslands are extensive. Fire suppression has led to th e invasion of many grasslan ds by woody plants, mainly juniper and mesquite in Arizona. D rought has also had major effects. Vegetation change in grasslands has been extensive and drama tic. Native grasslands with low shrub cover now occupy only 2 million a cres or 15.4% of former grassland. Roughly, three -quarters of this high -quality native grassland, or 1.4 mi llion acres, occurs in the U.S. (13.7% of current and former U.S. grassland). Shrub encroa chment has occurred on over 9.2 million acres or 70.7% of c urrent and former grasslands. Approxim ately 3.8 million acres of this is restorable back to native grassland using brush management coupled with grazing rest and pre scribed burns (29.2% of current and former grassland). However, shrub cover has exceeded a threshold p roducing a type conversion from grassland to shrub land on over 4.1 million acres o r 36% of the historic extent of grasslands in the ecoregion28. 28 Gori, D.F., and C.A.F. Enquist. 2003. An Assessment of the Spatial Extent and Condition of Grasslands in Central and Southern Arizona, Southwestern New Mexico and Northern Mexico. Prepared by The Nature Conservancy, Arizona Chapter. 28 pp. pg. 29 Interactions between droug ht and the introduction lovegrass (Erag rostis lehmanniana ) have contributed to the decrease in grassland productivity in Arizona. The clumped growth form of the native perennial bunch grasses provides open spaces that allow the establishment of invading plants. This along with the fact that nat ive grasses do poorly under drought and/or heavy grazing have played a role in non -native plants gaining a foothold29. However, changes in grassland composition and structure have not occurred uniformly across the region and t heir extent and distribution a re poorly understood at a regional scale. Moreover, these changes are dynamic and ongoing. This means land managers across Arizona still have time to assess and characterize the exte nt of the vegetation changes in grasslands and to identify the best remain ing native grasslands and restorable grasslands to manage grassland decline. The map below depicts 12 different classes of grasslands and whe re they occur across Arizona. The map comes from the Nature Conservancy, where they have a full explanation of each of the different classes. 29 Gurevitch. J., et. al., 2006. The Ecology of Plants. Sinauer Associates Inc. Chapter 18: Biomes. Pg. 435. pg. 30 pg. 31 5.4 Overview of Arizona's Deserts The state of Arizona is home to f our deserts: the Mojave Desert, Great Basin Desert, Chihuahuan Desert, and Sonoran Desert. The Mojave Desert covers a small portion of the northwest corner of th e state and is characterized by a rainy winter season with hard freezes. Vegetation in the Mojave Desert consists o f creosote bush ( Larrea trident ata), ), arborescent yuc ca, grasses, and annual flowers that bloom during wet years. The Great Basin Desert is located in the northernmost region of the state and is known for its very cold winters. Vegetation lies dormant during the cold winters, limiting plant growth to the summer season. The vegetation consists of low, small -leafed shrubs. There are no trees or cacti in the Great Basin Desert, and the environment is often dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentat ae). The Chihuahuan Desert is located in the southeastern corner of the state at a higher elevation than the other three deserts. The vegetation consists low shrubs, succulents, small cacti, grasses, and few trees. Precipitation is predominantly in the summer, but winter rain at the northern end of the desert can cause a springtime bloom of annual flowers. The Sonoran Desert is the largest desert in Arizo na and encompasses m ost of the southern half of the state. The Sonoran Desert also houses the majority of the state's human population, along with over 2,000 plant species and nearly 550 species of vert ebrates. Mild winters allow for trees, grasses, cacti, shrubs, and wildflowers to persist and stay in season year round30. Some of the key plant species Precipitation in two of these desert s com es at one time period during the year. The Mojave Desert receives almost all of its rain in the winter, while the Chihuahuan Desert receives mainly summer rains. The Sonoran Desert is unique among the other deserts as it has two periods of rainfall (also k nown as bimodal) , a winter and a summer rainy season, with very dry autumn and spring seasons separating them. As a result, the Sonoran is the greenest of Arizona's deserts, with the highest standing biomass and productivity, and is one of the most florist ically diverse31. Desert Impacts The deserts across Arizona are important areas for agriculture and seasonal livestock grazing , and they are becoming increasingly important for recreation as well. For most of human history and prehistory, human populations in deserts have been very low and centered on perennial river systems. In the last 70 plus years , however, the re has been rapid growth in Ph oenix and Tucson, which in turn has had some negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystems. The growth of the urban population centers strain water resources , whether it b e ground water or surface water. G razing, by bo th livestock and wild burros and horses , has effects in many deserts. Heavy grazing disturbs the soil and increases the opportunity for invas ive plants to take hold . Annual invasive serious threats to the Great Basin Desert and Sonoran Desert, respectively. These species have established at such levels that they fuel wi ldfires in areas that traditionally did not burn. Further, buffelgrass ( Pennisetum ciliare ) is another invasive grass - a perennial bunchgrass - that has fueled wildfires in the Sonoran Desert in and around Tucson, damaging or in some cases destroying sagu aros and other desert plants not adapted to fire.

Beca use the vegetation hold s the soil in place, the loss of veget ation through human activities leads to soil loss and erosion by wind and water. These impacts are challenging to address, but merit consideration in the context of Arizona's desert landscapes . pg. 33 6.0 Critical Natural Resource Issues for Arizona Overview The first Assessment's Task Group came up with seven critical issues, which pertain to the forests of Arizona; this list has since been expanded to eight critical issues and now pertains to all landscapes in Arizona, not just forest s. Critical Issues: 1. People and Landscapes 2. Ecosystem Health 3. Water 4. Air 5. Fire 6. Economics 7. Climate Change 8. Culture The following pages explore these eight critical issues in more detail. Each issue discussion includes a brief description and overview, a description of threats/benefits and key elements, and work to identify relevant areas of the state to focus implementation resources and future investigations. In creating the original Assessment , the groups discovered concerns that affected each of the critical issues. These concerns were: Funding to accomplish forest management activities Building capacity to collaboratively accomplish forest management goals, an d Educating the public and decision makers about forest management. It was clear as strategies were developed and implemented various aspects of funding, capacity, and education must be cons idered because each of the critical issue discussions touched on these issues in one way or another. Funding encompasses several sub -issues: government funding for project planning, design, and implementation; private investment to develop industries that can offset treatment and management costs; valuation of ecosystem services; and balancing of current investm ents with future cost savings (i.e., investment in fuel reduction treatments now compared to wildfire suppression costs later). Capacity refers to the combined resources and ability of various entities cooperating to accomplish restoration and management at the landscape scale. Projects will necessarily have to increase in scale, from thousands to tens and hundreds -of-thousands of acres, and move to new and innovative approaches . Of course, funding is required to create, maintain or expand capacity, but in creased capacity must be specifically addressed and integrated into overall activities. Education of the public and decision makers is necessary to assure their support for the kinds of actions required to address each critical resource issue. Kno wledge, understanding, and involvement by diverse participants is required for appropriate ecosystem management and restoration to move forward. Without an educated public, support may be tentative, litigation is more likely, and funding may be diverted to other priorities. pg. 34 6.1 People and Landscapes Critical Issue Description Arizona's population has grown for decades at a tremendous rate, and expectations are for continued growth through mid -century and beyond. This expansion brings people into e ver-closer proximity with Arizona's natural resources such as forest s, woodlands, and riparian areas, allowing them to garner a broad ar ray of benefits from these areas , yet at the same time affecting th ese ecosystems in many ways. What were once remote wildl ands with occasional visitors are becoming backyards and crowded playgrounds to expanding suburban neighborhoods. People migrating from urban areas often begin to face new challe nges such as fire, smoke, access, water supply, and land use issues. At t he same time, distant metropolitan areas continue to increase demand for some of the most precious natural resource commodities. Introduction People have been int eracting with the landscape and natural resources for thousands of years. These landscapes provide significant ecosys tem goods and services to society. The vegetation contained in these areas build s soils through decomposition of biomass and protect them from erosion with basal and canopy cover. W atersheds in more productive areas provide two -thirds of the drinking water in the United States32 and they absorb 10% of the carbon dioxide that Americans emit each year33. They shelter fish and wildlife, and offer aesthetic beauty and spiri tual renewal for people. Natural landscapes bolster our economy thr ough recreation and tourism, through the creation of green jobs, and through the production of renewable wood products and energy. These wild areas are part of our cultural heritage as Americans. They are a national treasure to be protected and preserved f or generations to come. Benefits, Threats, and Impacts Benefits Forests, woodlands, and riparian areas are important economically for jobs and rural economies. Urban and community forests form the green infrastructure system on which many communities depen d for aesthetics and shade . Improving forest health while reducing risk due to insects, disease and catastrophic wildfire, will enhance c onditions with respect to traditional, cultural, and historical values. Threats and Impacts Increased pressures from a rapidly expanding population -Arizona's population has doubled during the past 25 years to more than seven million p eople . Conversion of rural land to urban and suburban uses --development and sprawl. 32 NRC, 2008.

N orthern Institute of Applied Carbon Science, USDA Forest Service -Northern Research Station. pg. 35 Recreation pressures on public lands will increase as pri vate and state trust lands are developed. As opportunities for recreation are reduced on these lands due to Arizona's rapidly expanding population, public lands will be relied upon more heavily to provide recreation opportunities. Land ownership patterns a re changing towards infrastructure and industry . Deforestation -type impacts occur through loss of forests to stand -replacing fire, land development, and other forested land use changes. Globally, it is estimated that almost 20 percent of human -caused carbon emissions are from deforestation. Key Elements Population In 2017, more than seven million people lived in Arizona. Projections indicate t hat the population will be greater than 10 mi llion by 2030 and nearly 16 million by 2050. Arizona has typically ranked first or second nationally in rate of population growth in recent years --between 4 -5% annually for th e past decade. Certain ethnic groups have also increased as a percentage of the o verall population. As one example, the Hispanic population has grown from 20 percent to 25 percent of the overall total since 1940. Other groups have decreased --the Native American population has decli ned from 11 percent in 1940 to 4 percent in 2017 . There have also been population changes relative to age during recent decades. Many Arizona counties have had increases in population of people who are 65 and older. It is important to assess the current and future impact s of population growth on resources suc h as water, wildlife and forest/woodland cover, as well as to develop information about future recreation trends and impacts. Conserve Working Forests: Forest Conversion, Development, and Sprawl Most of Arizona's population growth and associated development is occurring in suburban and rural areas that surround existing cities --areas previously characterized by forest, desert, and agricultural land. This trend in Arizona mirrors urbanization throughout the country where forests are being permanently converte d to non -forest uses at a rate of 1 million acres per year. Nationally, 262 million private forested acres belong to families and individuals (i.e. Non -industrial private forests) . Many of these landowners lack the technical or financial resources to mana ge their lands in a way that society can fully benefit. While management planning helps families make a long -term commitment to the land, estimates suggest that only 3% of family forest owners have a written resource management plan. Working forests are al so important economically for jobs and rural economies. Changing Demographics and Values Our country has shifted from being primarily rural to being nearly 80 percent urban and suburban dwellers, with the areas of greatest growth in the West and the coasta l South. The nature of forestland ownership is also changing. The average age of forest landowners is increasing while the size of their forested parcels is rapidly decreasing. Ninety percent of landowners own fewer than 50 acres , with half of those owning 9 acres or less. People in the United States have mixed feelings about the value they place on forests. Some desire to use forests with unlimited access or for maximum profit, while others seek to conserve and protect forests to the highest degree practi cable. pg. 36 Historical and Cultural Values of Forests and Sites within Forests Although special places are inherently difficult to identify and categorize, all lands whether they are tribal, federal, state or private have many identifiable places that are consi dered special by various cultures, groups, and individuals. Take for example areas where families have been hunting/fishing for generations. It is difficult to identify these areas unless you are the individual or group that uses these areas. Recreation Statistics show that virtually every recreational activity is on the rise on Arizona public lands, including those described as unmanaged activities. Largely driven by population growth and available transportation and access, many experts view this situation as a significant threat for national forests specifically, and for forests in general. There is concern that increased demand cannot be met due to limited recreation facilities, and infrastructure. Experience provides evidence t hat unmanaged recreation is causing damage to resources that can be costly to mitigate. Increasin g problems with invasive plants and animals may be partially attributed to recreational activity. Recreation pressures are extremely high on forested lands around Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP). For example, nearly 150 trailheads on the Kaibab National Forest are in close proxim ity to GCNP. Roughly, 97% of the visitors to the Kaibab N ational Forest are Caucasian. Hispanics make up most of the remaining balance of those who provided ethnicity information in one study . Approximately 6% of the visitors are international. Communities Issues of concern for communities include water availability, recreation, wildfire protection, access for fuelwood gathering and other uses, smoke management, protection of wildlife and habitat, aesthetics, cultural resources, a nd many others. Wildland -urban interface areas (WUI) create complex relationships for surrounding forests and communities. Such relationships not only affect fuel management and wild Arizona St ate Parks & Trails Accreditation Arizona State Parks and Trails has become the first state park system in the country to achieve accreditation from the Commission for the Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA) for best practices in operation and service. CAPRA accreditation is the only national accreditation for park and recreation agencies, and is a measure of an agency's overall quality of operations, managem ent, and service to the public. Agency staff played an integral role in reviewing, improving, and implementing policies, procedures, and plans that support the agency's mission and deliver high -quality experiences to visitors. The public benefits f rom accreditation by knowing the agency is adhering to best practices in the field of parks , facilities, and programs. It also demonstrates to partners and potential funders that the agency operates under such standards. pg. 37 land fire management by government agencies, they also may influence how the agency manages vegetation with forest restoration treatments. Communities include those of both place and interest. Communities include cities and towns that may affect or be affected by a forested area and any stakeholders with an interest in a forested area whether consumptive or passive. Some communities have expr essed concerns that national forest land ownership prevents development. The U.S. Forest Service has developed an Open Space Strategy that provides broad concepts for working cooperatively with communities to address open space and development potential issues. Land exchanges are one option to address this issue. As population s increase , community needs usually result in increased need for forest access, transportation routes , and utility corridors. These needs can contribute to forest fragmentation. Urban and Community Forestry Jim Skiera, International Society of Arboriculture executive director, said, \"We often think of planting trees in a rural setting, overlooking that more than 80% of the population live in our cities, where additional trees can prov ide the greatest benefit.\" Urban and community forests are critical components of the human living infrastructure and people/forest connection. This forest type is a dynamic resource that provides environmental services such as improving air quality, mitig ating heat , improving storm water capture , controlling erosion, and improving soils. Trees and other vegetative biodiversity provide corridors for wildlife and people. They cool cities (counteracting the urban heat island effect) and communities, save ener gy, affect environmental health issues, Glendale Desert Food Forest Part regenerative landscape part outdoor c lassroom, the Glendale Desert Food Forest connects residents to the Sonoran Desert's array of water wise edible plants. The city of Glendale Water Services Department packed this one of a kind amenity with over 100 edible plants. The use of plants with alt ernating fruiting seasons ensures year round food for people and wildlife. This hardy demonstration project consists entirely of low water use plants and survives off rainfall and minimal supplemental irrigation. The Desert Food Forest is an ideal setting for ongoing public education and outreach activities. Free classes on sustainable landscaping and growing desert edibles are led by local garden experts. The \"Taste Your yard\" programs encourage people to sample desert foods, such as agave syrup, prickly p ear candy and pomegranate juice. Visitors can also take self -guided garden tours to delve deeper into planting their own food forests. This Public -private partnership was funded through an Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management grant and invol ved several partners, including the Glendale Public Library, Linking Edible Arizona Forests Network, Maricopa County Master Gardener program, and Trees Matter. Together, we are promoting water conservation, supporting local food production and spreading th e message, \"Have you yard and eat it, too!\" pg. 38 reduce noise pollution, strengthen social cohesion, leverage community revitalization, and add economic value. Urban and community forests broadly include urban parks, street trees, landscaped boulevards, neighborho od parks, urban private land, commercial sites, schools and higher education facilities, public gardens, river corridors and promenades, greenways, wetlands, nature preserves, natural areas, shelter belts of trees and working trees at industrial brown fiel d sites. They add form, structure, beauty, and breathing room to the urban design and provide places to recreate, opportunities to improve social connections, complement smart growth, and create a more walkable community. Moreover, t hey create environmenta l education opportunities for populations that do not have access to rural forests. The current condition of urban and community forests of Arizona is of immediate concern because the percentage of urban forest cover (total vegetation covering the ground) in major metropolitan areas like Phoenix is low compared to regional standards (Tree and Shade Master Plan). Challenges to maintain these forests are: Limited urban forestry staff trees not being replanted at the same rate as they are being lost or removed low overall urban shade canopies out of date and inadequate tree standards in zoning ordinances; limited irrigation water resources educational prog rams eliminated or underfunded poor planting, mainten ance, and irrigation practices limited communi ty and business partnerships incomplete tre e inventory or GIS location information regulatory hurdles that create disi ncentives for structural shade limited understanding by the general pu blic of the importance of trees Grazing/Rangeland Values Federal and state trust lands have provided an important econo mic base for communities in areas where agricultural activities are important and where available private land for grazing and rangeland use is limited. Grazing leases and allotments on rural lands, includ ing those of the national forests, a re often a key component of ranching operations . National forests account for approximately 15% of all lands in Arizona and in some counties, the percentage is higher. State and federal programs are now being used to assist landowners as well as grazing and agricultural lessees of state trust or federal lands. Assistance is provided to implement conservatio n-based management activities using livestock and crop production practices that provide wildlife habitat or other public benefits and preserve open space. Some examples are the NRCS Environmental Quality I ncentives Program (EQIP) and the Arizona Department of Agriculture's Livestock and Crop Conservation Grant Program. Under provisions of the 2008 Farm Bill, EQIP has also become a primary source of funding for forestry work on nonindustrial private forestlands. There has generally been a decrease of grazing activity on Arizona national forests during the last 20 years. Some national forests have had decreases in the n umber of active grazing allotments or permittees. One forest that has maintained a stable number of allotments and permittees had a decrease in the number pg. 39 of cattle permitted to graze. According to the U.S. Forest Service, some of the reductions are attrib utable to prolonged drought and monitoring data showing a decline in rangeland conditions . Education Surveys and research indicate there is strong support for natural resource conservation education. Respondents believe that the goals of developing volunt eer programs to improve forests and grasslands, and maintain trails and recreation facilities are important. In general, there is strong support for providing greater information to the public in the form of education on proper recreation use, the environm ental impacts of different uses, and the economic value derived from developing and preserving natural resources. Collaboration between groups for information sharing purposes is also considered an impor tant goal. However, programs and funding can quickly be exhausted. Information and tools that engage the general population and decision makers in stewardship of our forest and related resources will be critical. Other Considerations/ Related Issues Wood for houses, furniture, paper, and other products: Nine ty-two (92) percent of all trees harvested in the United States come from private forests Loss of markets for forest products: More than 330 wood processing mills have closed nationwide since 1997 and more than 158,000 jobs have been lost. Forest ecosystem s contribute to the social and economic sustainability of local communities by providing place s for recreation . However, we must consider that increasing numbers of people hiking, camping, and recreating within an area of limited size and resources may aff ect the ability of forest ecosys tems to sustain such use . Industries , such as mining, logging, and grazing may continue to affect ecological s tructure and function , which, in turn, will affect the sustainability of future social and economic endeavors. Resources - Existing and Needed Existing Resources: DFFM staff and consulting foresters assist privat e landowners, federal agencies, and municipalities. Statewide and local non -governmental conservation organizations provide active engagement at the state and community level. State universities and institutes provide science -based support and other resources. Local Natural Resource Conservation Districts (NRCDs) provide technical assistance to land owners and the identification of local resource concerns a nd opportunities . Committees and councils (e.g., Arizona Forest Stewardship Committee, Governors Forest Health Council, and Arizona Community Tree Council) help direct across broad areas . Resource Needs: Appropriate human resources within the DFFM, such as a Tribal Liaison position. Involvement and support from community leaders. Better information and education on the costs and benefits of ecosystem management activities including prescribed and natural fires; forest restoration; marketable value for the n umerous pg. 40 benefits that forested lands provide, such as clean water, wildlife habitat, aesthetics, and recreation. Economic data on the value of ecosystem services (need data to show the valuation of these services in Arizona so they can be included in land management planning decisions). Data and accurate information on the economic benefits of forest -based recreation and tourism. Key Partners/Stakeholders Many of the partners and stakeholders have a potential role in supporting implementation of this strat egy. A few stand out as being critical to success: Arizona Community Tree Council Arizona Forest Stewardship Council Environmental and conservation non -governmental organizations Recreation associations and groups County supervisors, managers, planning and zoning committees Municipal mayors, council members, managers, planning and zoning commissions Developers, builders and related associations State universities USDA Forest Service Community Forestry Committee Arizona State Parks National Park Service Four Forest Restoration Initiative Priority Areas Focus areas for the People and Forest s issue are identified and mapped below. These focus areas were used as the initial priority areas for this issue. Additional c riteria that were used to refine priority areas, or identify additional priority areas, include: Areas with high recreational value and use. Areas of wildland/urban interface (WUI) or forested areas with high development potential. Forest landscapes impact ed by the socio -economic threats to working forests, such as the loss of private forest lands to residential, commercial, and industrial development.

Dramatic signals of unraveling ecosystems include large, uncharacteristic crown fires; effects of prolonged drought; excessive fuel buildup; vegetative loss from insects and tree pathogens; and widespread decreases in the biodiversity of both plants and animals. Evidence -based research indicates that some Arizona ecosystems are very different from historic conditions. Key indicators include changes in nutrient cycling, decr eases in species diversity, invasion by exotic species, declining watershed functio n, and disruption of natural fire regimes. It is essential we accurately identify the reasons for decline in the health of ecosystems and respond appropriately. Introduction Ecosystems provide necessary habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, as we ll as critical goods and services to the public. Nevertheless, evidence of declining ecosystem health is clear across Arizona. Uncharacteristic fire behavior, disease and insect outbreaks, and declining biodiversity are among the most noticeable effects. S cience -based strategies are essential for restoring ecological integrity so the goods and services these ecosystems provide are sustained into the future. Stakeholder engagement and collaboration are critical element s to effectively address Arizona's Fore st ecosystems at a landscape level as well ast he ability to attract a wide group of active stakeholder engagement that can work collaboratively to set priorities, secure funding, build social support and establish treatment objectives . Key Elements Ecosy stem functions must be accurately identified to allow science -based strategies to be implemented at an accelerated pace on a landscape scale. Defining and assessing the health of complex ecosystems is not easy. Ecosystem health issues result ing from human activity, are brought to light because of human concerns, and are addressed through human intervention. We need to ensure ecological components of ecosystems are resilient to disturbances, including human activities and climate variability34. Ecosystem res toration must be based on sound science. This requires an understanding of how ecosystems function, how they support human use, and how policy and management affect the environment35. Indicators of healthy ecosystems inclu de: 1) biological diversity, 2) bio tic integrity and resilience , and 3) natural disturbances (e.g., seasonal flooding in riparian areas) . These indicators accurately reflect the biological and physical aspects of a healthy ecosystem that in turn supports the human dimensions (needs and uses ) of a functional ecosystem. Natural disturbances, such as; fire, wind damage, flooding, and insect and disease kills within the ecosystem are indicators of a healthy ecosystem. Natural disturbance processes allow for the shifting of a plant communities s tructure and age across the landscape. Ecotone shifts are influenced at both the 34 Apache -Sitgreaves FLMP, pg. 12.

The presence of a mosaic of plant communities and the variety within them provides resilience to disturbances36. Ecological conditions for habitat quality, distribution, and abundance contribute to self -sustaining populations of plants and animals that are interrelated and properly distributed . Appropriate conditions provide for the life history needs, distribution, and natural population fluctuations of the species within the carrying capacity of the landscape37.

Currently under revision. 37 Id. 1 pg. 47 Wildf ire Fire research has shown fire regimes vary widely across ecosystems in Arizona. Prior to European settlement, fire (especially as influen ced by climate) had the largest single impact in shaping the ecology of the Southwest. It continues to day to be the greatest force controlling ecosystems. Historically, both lightning and human -caused fire would burn until ex tinguished by rain or until it ran out of fuel --typically when they reached an area that had recently burned. Fires could burn for months and cover thousands of acres38. As a result, most forest stands burned every 2 to 30 years as low intensity, area -wide fires. Pre - settl ement mixed con ifer forest may have burned as frequently as ponderosa pine forest39. With greater moisture levels and heavier fuel loads, spruce -fir forests burned much less frequently but at high, stand - replacing intensity40. 38 Swetnam, T.W. and C.H. Baisan. 1996.

The Initiative's primary objective is to assure that the science -based and socially acceptable agreements forged over the pas t several years result in implementation of long -term, landscape -scale forest restoration as soon as possible. The 4FRI vision is to undertake, across approximately 2.4 million acres of ponderosa pine forest, landscape -scale restoration that will support resilien t and diverse forest ecosystems, populations of native plants and animals, reduced destructive wildfire threat, and sustainable forest products industries . 500,000 acres are currently \"NEPA -cleared\" for mechanical thinning and another estimated 450 ,000 to 900,000 acres are expected to be available in the future through the current Rim Country Environmental Impact Statement. pg. 48 Historic fire regimes changed dramatically with the coming of Euro -American settlers. Livestock removed much of the grassy fuels that carried frequent, surface fires, and roads and trails broke up the continuity of fuels and further contributed to reductions in fire frequency and size41. Fire suppression and reduction in the harvest of woody vegetation has contributed to the b uildup of flammable materials. Fire suppression permits tree and shrub encroachment into openings and, as a result, dramatic reductions in the size of forest and mountain meadows. Disruption of natural fire regimes has also decreased plant diversity acros s much of Arizona. Establishment of young plants in older stands provides a ladder fuel that carries ground level fire up into the canopy. With more stand -replacing fires, average stand age is reduced and the diversity inherent in old, mature stands is oft en lost. Logging creates heavy fuels in the form of remaining limbs, treetops , and cull logs. In most areas however, these fuels have been removed by various treatments; slash disposal (pile burning or chipping), biomass utilization, prescribed fire, or fi rewood collection. Those areas with the greatest fire hazard are the ones with the greatest fuel accumulati ons, such as stands never treated or logged without subsequent slash treatment. Due to heavy fuel accumulations and climate change, today's fires are often more intense and more difficult to contain. The overall number of fires has been increasing across the state, with larger, more damaging fires also increasing. The number of fires burning more than 10 acres in size has increased each decade since t he 1930s. The average size of fires since the 1970s has ranged from 14 to 16 acres per fire, double the average size of fires in earlier decades. The size of fires in the last ten years have ranged from several hundred acres to surpassing 500,000 acre s in size (e.g., Wallow Fire), burning at the landscape scale. The interaction of fire and climate are well documented, and the Southwest is expected to continue to trend toward a substantially warmer, drier climate than has been recorded42. This climate trend w ill continue to increase the length of fire seasons further beyond the summer months43, and increase the frequency, size, and severity of forest fires44. The Coronado National Forest adopted a strategy for restoring fire -adapted ecosystems at a large scale (i.e., hundreds of thousands of acres). This strategy, called FireScape (developed 2006 with individual district plans created up to 2020 ), involves multiple partners across land ownership boundaries, using the best scientific information available, and str eamlining environmental compliance processes. It will eventually be applied to each of the 12 major mountain ranges within the Coronado National Forest . The Huachuca FireScape project, which covers 400,000 acres in the Huachuca and Whetstone mountains, was recently approved and implementation has begun . Additional FireScape projects are underway in the Ch Dragoon, W.W. and M.M. Moore. 1994. Southwestern ponderosa forest structure: changes since EuroAmerican settlement.

These species co\u00adevolved with their hosts as members of dynamic, interacting communities. Through their ability to cause widespread tree mortality, defo liation, decay or deformity, some of these species achieved significant ecological importance as disturbance agents. Along with fire, these agents are among the more important regulators of plant density, composition, and structure. Landscape conditions, i n turn, affect the distribution and reproduction of insects and pathogens. Directly and indirectly, these species interact with other members of the ecological community influencing various ecosystem processes, providing food and creating habitat for other organisms, affecting nutrient cycling, and influencing fire behavior. The species of primary interest in Arizona include bark beetles (Ips spp.), several species of defoliating insects, dwarf and root decay fungi. Bark beetles and defoliators are usually present in low populations, but they will periodically increase to outbreak levels. Although populations of dwarf mistletoe and root decay fungi fluctuate, their rates of change are much slow er. These species, however, are very persistent and occur annually rather than sporadically. Significant impacts to more common species of trees and woody plants have been seen in recent years, primarily from insects and diseases related to drought. In so me instances, thousands of acres of select species, such as pinyon pine, have been killed. Introduc tion of invasive plant species Invasive plant species continue to pose a challenge in ecosystems across Arizona. Control of infestations can be expensive a nd difficult, but the ecological c onsequences of no action are serious. The expansion of invasive plant populations is affe cting our ability to restore native plant communities and re -establish desired conditions. If invasive plants are not kept in che ck, long -term negative effects to ecosystems can occur. The ecological effects include replacement of native plant species and a reduction in ground cover, which leads to loss of biodiversity, forage for livestock and wildlife , habitat, scenic quality, and soil productivity. A recent invasive species survey in northern Arizona by the U.S. Forest Service and others det ermined that weed populations continue to spread affecting several forests . Goals identified for national forests in Arizona include the follo wing: Prevent any new noxious or invasive plant species from becoming established using the approach of early detection and rapid response . Contain or control the spread of known invasive plant species and eradicate species that are the most invasive and p ose the greatest threat to biological diversity and watershed condition. Incorporate measures to control invasive plant species into project planning, implementation, and monitoring. Changes in forest diversity and s tructure : Plant succession and disturba nce are now recognized as closely connected processes that together determine vegetation dynamics. Changes in the structure of many forests in Arizona are represented by pg. 50 a substantial increase in small -diameter trees (less than 16 inches DBH), an increase in medium -sized trees (16 to 24 inches DBH), and a decrease in the number of trees greater than 24 inches DBH. Probably the largest ef fect on forest health in ponderosa pine stands is due to the increase in the density of small trees. This effect is expre ssed in several ways: Increased tree density reduces the abundance and diversity of understory plants. An increase in ladder fuels so large crown fires are now more common. Increased tree density reduces tree vigor resulting in susceptibility to bark beetles. Dense stands provide suitable conditions for rapid spread and intensification of dwarf mistletoe. Increased tree density results in lower water yields, which affects riparian areas and watersheds. In addition to increased density, ponde rosa pine f orests are becoming uniform, with the loss of horizontal and vertical structural diversity and species composition. Changes in Wildlife Diversity Wildlife di versity and population health are directly linked to the quality of available habitat (food, water , cover and space) . There are more than 150 species listed in the State Wildlife Action Plan45 that are dependent on forest habitats for a portion of their life cycle, and changes outlined all have an impact on the viability of these species. The reduced h ealth of Arizona forests has adversely affected habitat quality for wildlife in several ways: The exclusion of low -intensity fire from frequent -fire systems such as ponderosa pine has created more homogenous stands that lack the mature/old -growth tree com ponent important t o many wildlife species and reduced productivity of browse and herbaceous understo ry plants that provide wildlife food sources. High -elevation wet meadows and aspen stands have been encroached by conifers. Flood events, ash flows, and sil tation following unnaturally large and intense wildfires have impaired or severely damaged aquatic habitats for native and sport fish. Critical habitats for federally listed species, such as the Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida ), have been c onsumed or are at increased risk from damage by wildfire. Fire suppression in grasslands and the woodland -grassland ecotone has allowed widespread expansion of woody sp ecies such as juniper and mesquite , decreasing habitat quality for pronghorn (Antilocarp a americana ) and other grassland -obligate species. Needs for improving wildlife habitat conditions include: Creating diverse stand conditions that reflect historical ranges of variability for different forest types. Creation and/or improvement of habitat q uality, distribution, and abundance to support nativ e wildlife and the recovery or stabilization of federally listed plant and animal species 45 https://www.azgfd.com/PortalImages/files/wildlife/2012 -2022_Arizon a_State_Wildlife_Action_Plan.pdf , Arizona Game and Fish Department 5000 West Carefree Highway Phoenix, Arizona 85086 -5000, May 2012 pg. 51 Prioritization of threatened and endangered species, sensitive species, emphasis species, and comprehensive plan g oals--in that order --whenever conflicts between wildlife species exist when designing structural and nonstructural improvements Strategic habitat improvement including: 1) prescribed burning, 2) seeding and planting of desirable browse and herbaceous forag e species, 3) maintenance and development of wildlife water sources; 4) prevention and control of invasive plants, and 5) restoration of aquatic systems, springs, high -elevation wet meadows, and other key habitats. Inventory of riparian and aquatic habita ts as well as key plant species requiring protection Provide improved and protected habitat for key fish and wildlife species that rely on forest and riparian communities; implement goals of the SWAP and other wildlife management strategies Provide three levels of habitat management for the Mexican spotted owl --protected, restricted, and other forest and woodland types --to achieve a diversity of owl habitat conditions across the landscape Within Mexican spotted owl pro tected and restricted ar eas, Mexican spotted owl standards and guidelines take precedence over the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis ) standards and guidelines on federal forest land because they are more restrictive and lead to greater species diversity Cooperation with AZGFD on control of aquatic invasive plants and undesirable fish species and stocking to meet management goals for native and sport fish. Construction of barriers to protect key riparian areas from excessive livestock grazing impacts Provide and maintain devel oped water sources like rainfall catchments for wildlife in locations where natural sources are insufficient. Where fences are needed, install or upgrade to wildlife -friendly designs that facilitate habitat connectivity and reduce injuries/ mortalities. Wh ere app ropriate, remove fences no longer needed for livestock operations or other purposes. Human Needs and Uses In Arizona, trees and forests provide several public benefits that contribute significantly to our quality of life. These benefits often are referred to as ecosystem services and can be defined as \"the life -support and life -enhancing services of natural ecosystems\" . Primary among these services are clean and abundant drinking water, habitat to support native biodiv ersity, wood products, fuel and renewable energy, carbon sequestration, and diverse recreational and scenic opportunities. In urban an d community settings, vegetation serve s as green infrastructure that improves air and water quality; reduces energy needs; buffers noise pollution; provides food, cover, and travel corridors for wildlife; and offers opportunities for relaxation and respite. As the human pop ulation has increased , so has use and demands on forested lands. This increased use has generated threats and impacts that adverse ly affect ecosystem health. Primary contributors to ecosystem decline are conversion of forestland to other uses, dr amatic increase in off -highway vehicle use impacts, and the onset of human -caused wildfires. Forested areas are highly desirable for home s ites or new subdivisions. With this conversion comes a loss of productive forests, increased wildfire risk to property as more homes are \"in the woods,\" and pressure to reduce or eliminate appropriate management activities on adjacent lands (e.g., prescrib ed burns and concerns about smoke) . Forest fragmentation is another result of urbanization. Also important are those pg. 52 areas converted from one housing density to a significantly higher density as this may lead to loss of tree canopy and the benefits to ecos ystem function. The increase in off -road vehicles (ORV) can lead to adverse impacts and degradation of all ecosystem components. Such use has increased erosion, soil compaction, spread of invasive plants, and damage to archaeological/ cultural sites, distur bance to wildlife, destruction of wildlife habitat, and risks to watershed function. Managing the areas where impact is greatest will help alleviate these impacts. Ecos ystem Integrity and Resilience Policies for ecological restoration are informed by peer -reviewed science on the quantitative side and by ethics on the qualitative side. Science by itself is inevitably value laden, and the legislative framework that established and governs our public -lands --including the legislation --is based on so -called \"ci tizen choices\"46. Properly designed restoration treatments wi ll begin to develop the social capital needed to create and maintain sustai nable livelihoods in Arizona's ecosystems, which are deemed a priority. Restoration projects will necessitate creating jobs inclu de prescribed burning , reforestation and planting of understory vegetation, controlling invasive species, establishing a variety of appropriate -sized industries utilizing wood fiber, and other managem ent activities conducive to restoration goals an d objectives. Such activities can help build social capital, which will enable not only sustainable jobs and industries, but also the sustainability of ecosystem functions, and restoration decisions that are science -based and effectively placed to treat fo rested ecosystems at the landscape scale. Collaborative Engagement with Stakeholders Diverse forest ecosystems of Arizona extend beyond jurisdiction al boundaries and require a collaborative approach and stakeholder engagement to affect positive change at a scale that can address ecosystem health. Engagement and support of existing large scale, multijurisdictional projects and groups provide a path to supporting ecosystem health and resilience at scale. Other Considerations/ Related Issues Functioning and s ustainable ecosystems contribute to sustainable economies by facilitating an infrastructure for treating, utilizing, and monitoring ecosystem components. Only through rigorous scientific evaluation can ecosystem management actions be identified, and an ada ptive management and evaluation methodology determined and implemented. Applying adaptive management in ecosystem management and restoration measures include \"learning by doing\", implementing the best science in a timely strategy, and moving forward at the landscape scale. Recognizing that unnatural crown fires and other symptoms of ecosystem stress are signals that these ecosystems are at risk, we must act and act quickly. 46 Sagoff, M. 1988. The Economy of the Earth: Philosophy, Law, and the Environment. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pg. 53 Ecosystem restoration efforts should follow a holistic, systematic approach, charact erized by clear -thinking, local collaboration, and solid knowledge, both of the biophysical system and of the socio -political system47. Resources - Existing and Needed Existing Resources Use existing agency plans and assessments to determine natural resource management options. Strong collaborative support for focused management practices across landscapes, such as forest restoration, fuel reduction, wildlife habitat and population management, and treatments to control exotic pests and invasive plants . When appropriate and funding is available, use potential outside sources (i.e. consultants, organizations, others) for ecosystem evaluation and other task s to help accelerate treatments in priority areas. Prioritize engagement with existing collaborative like the 4FRI Stakeholders Group, the Fort Huachuca Sentinel Land Scape, The Bill Williams Mountain Restoration effort, and the Prescott Joint Chiefs Restoration Partnership . Resource Needs Develop and implement effective training, education, and outreac h programs to inform landowners, government officials, and the public about the benefits of resilient ecosystems. Develop and use the well -educated cadre of forest management professionals in Arizona to address forest threats across all lands in the state. Provide adequate levels of funding to vegetation management and fuel treatments. Develop and implement collaborative action plans to address needs o f unique, high -priority ecosystems including: riparian areas, urban and community forests, deserts, grassla nds, and areas threatened with type co nversion by invasive plants. Integrate federal, state, university, and other diagnostic/research resources to support surveillance and detection efforts focused on delineating priority treatment areas and identifying science -based treatment needs. Reduce hazardous fuels and stand densities of unsustainable, post -settlement vegetation. Develop and implement integrated landscape -scale restoration, community protection, wildlife habitat and population management, and fire management strategies for forests across jurisdictional boundaries. Federal and state land management agencies should collaboratively develop an integrated process to design and strategically place treatments to increase efficiency, maximize benefits, and limit the negative impacts of wildfire. Adequately restore forest structures through mechanical or prescribed fire treatments to ensure landscapes are compatible with frequent -fire regimes. Implement forest management activities that will allow for reestab lishment of frequent, low severity fire as a key process in ecosystems, including increased use of prescribed fire following 47 Covington, W.

Develop funding mechanisms for the successful implementation of all aspects o f ecosystem restoration activities and education projects. Key Partners/Stakeholders Many of the partners and stakeholders listed have a potential role in supporting implementation of this strategy. A few entities stand out as being critical to success: Collaborative organizations involved with ecological restoration Universities, research organizations, NGOs, local government officials USDA Forest Service (USFS) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Salt River Project (SRP) Arizona Public Service (APS) Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management (DFFM) Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) Arizona State Land Department (ASLD) Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) National Park Servi ce (NPS) National Forest Foundation (NFF) Four Forest Restoration Initiative Stakeholders Group (4FRI SHG) Natural Resources Working Group (NRWG) Prescott Joint Chiefs Restoration Partnership Fort Huachuca Sentinel Landscape We will continue to work with t hese and other stakeholders in the areas identified in this section to accelerate treatments that restore ecosystem health. pg. 55 Fort Huachuca Sentinel Landscape Fort Huachuca Sentinel Landscape is a diverse coalition of federal agencies, state and local gove rnments, NGOs, and private landowners that leverage their resources to protect natural and working lands. Fort Huachuca is home to the premier restricted military airspace for unmanned aircraft system training in the western U.S. A unique natural landscape around Fort Huachuca creates an electromagnetically quiet area for the Buffalo Soldier Electronic Test Range and restricted air space. The purpose of the Sentinel Landscape is to advance conservation initiatives, bolster local agricultural economies, and promote development that is compatible with Fort Huachuca's national defense and training mission. Local, state, and federal partners are working to conserve ecosystems in Cochise, Pima and Santa Cruz counties. Conservation opportunities include cooperati ve projects that improve water quality and quantity, range and forest conditions, wildlife habitat, and the status of rare species. Additionally, funding, outreach, and technical assistance will help maintain working forests that enhance vital sources of w ater for the entire region. The Sentinel Landscapes Partnership agencies will continue to support the Fort Huachuca Sentinel Landscape with ongoing technical assistance and funding through the NRCS -Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, support for bu ffer lands through DOD's Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Program, and other efforts at improving the availability and quality of surface and groundwater. Together, they are ensuring that Fort Huachuca, private landowners, and enda ngered species can continue to call southeastern Arizona home. pg. 56 Focus Areas and Priority Landscapes Focu s areas for Ecosystem Health are identified and mapped below. The following considerations were used to refine priority area designations: Priority will be given to working with existing landscape scale collaborative efforts. Most ecosystems in Arizona are experiencing critical levels of habitat decline; some ecosystems have been heavily impacted from events such as stand -replacing wildfire. H igh pr iority should be given to ecosystem above 6,000 ft. elevation with considerable risk of stand replacing fire potential and in areas that provide watershed function to support diverse ecosystem healt h. Critical ecosystems at elevations above 4,000 feet tha t are at risk must be prioritized using strong science based on ecological restoration principles. This will enable critical ecosystems to receive priority treatment. Ecosystems below 3,000 feet must also be evaluated using the best available science to en able proper treatment prioritization and management. Protecting aspen stands and riparian habitat a nd promoting their regeneration through natural disturbances. Management of forest -dependent wildlife and game species (elk, deer, etc.) that provide abunda nt opportunities for wildlife -associated recreation. Enhance or restore populations of reduced or extirpated species. Landscapes with characteristics conducive to unnaturally large and intense crown fire must receive priority consideration for treatment. Forest Stewardship Priority Areas (2019): Priority areas for DFFM's Forest Stewardship landowner assistance program. Forest Stewardship priority areas are landscapes considered to be of high program potential or priority. These priority areas are focused i n no more than 50% of total eligible forest stewardship acres in AZ. High priority areas consist of the 4FRI footprint, Bill Williams Mountain, Prescott Joint Chiefs, and the Sentinel Landscape. pg. 57 Arizona Forest Stewardship Priority Areas pg. 58 Invasive Plant Treatment Prioritization: Data gathered by DFFM to assess the Arizona landscape and identify invasive plant treatment priority areas based on management criteria. Fire Regime Condition Class: LANDFIRE Dataset - FRCC class 3 areas. A fire regime condition class (FRCC) is a classification of the amount of departure from the natural regime and is broken into five classes. Speci es of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) : This map represents a richness index for the SGCN as defined in Arizona's S tate Wildlife Action Plan . The model includes the number of Tier 1a and Tier 1b species (classified by vu lnerability scores ) accordin g to the following formula: Score = (Tier 1a \u00d7 2) + Tier1b. Resulting scores were rescaled from 1 - 10. Higher model scores indicate the potential for greater species richness in any area. Unfragmented Areas: The Unfragmented Areas map is based on the existence of large, contiguous landmasses that are not fragmented by barriers, the diversity of vegetation types within those land masses, and the importance of those areas to the overall availability of any particular vegetation type within the state. pg. 59 Goals, Objectives, and Actions The Strategy Team identified two (2) goals, eight (8) objectives and thirty -five (35) actions to address the Ecosystem Health issue. The goals are general in nature because they must be applicable in most ecosystems statewide. Objectives provide a clear as sessment of measurable outcomes focused on restoring or maintaining the health, resiliency, and sustainability of forest ecosystems. To ensure accurate assessment of ecosystem health has been determined, land managers must first evaluate historic trends t o determine the natural range of variability, establish and monitor reference conditions, determine appropriate treatment prescriptions, and work to mitigate potential factors or influences (wildfire, insect s and disease s, invasive species, etc.) that may preclude successful management decisions. Effective monitoring and adaptive management strategies are essential to ensure ecosystems -at-risk can be restored. Specific actions in achieving healthy, resilient, and sustainable ecosystems include the followin g goals : 1. Continue to develop strong collaborative support for focused management practices across integrated landscapes, such as forest restoration, fuel reduction, wildlife habitat and population management, urban community management, and treatments to c ontrol exotic pests and invasive plants 2. Protect, conserve, and enhance wildlife and fish habitat; improve habitat for selected species 3. Identify and conserve unique and high -priority ecosystems and landscapes 4. Identify and monitor threats to forests and ecos ystem health 5. Protect forests and other high priority ecosystems from fragmentation and conversion to non - forest uses 6. Restore forests, deserts, and grasslands impacted by disrupted fire regimes, forest pest outbreaks, land management practices/uses, and inv asive species 7. Protect watershed functions that support ecosystem services 8. Restore frequent -fire regimes as part of forest restoration measures 9.

According to the Census Bureau, Arizona grew at the natio n's fifth -fastest rate in 2017, topping seven million residents for the first time. Water is a limited resource in Arizona, and drought is among the issues challeng ing our ability to balance water demands for agriculture, industry, and an expanding population. Less snowpack, e arlier spring runoff and re duced watershed yield during the last several d ecades exacerbate this issue. An understanding of the occurrences, distribution, and movement of water is essential in agriculture, forestry, botany, soil science, geology, ecology, and geomorphology. In short, water is one of the most crucial elements of the physical environment. Impa cts on the quantity, quality, and distribution of Arizona's water supplies due to a changing climate are likely to be significant. The frequency of drought is projected to increase in the Southwest by the end of the century. There is also an increased chan ce of intense precipitation and flooding events during the monsoon season in Arizona due to greater water -holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere48. Groundwater use will increase in areas where surface water supplies decline. Communities are likely to tap aquifers to a greater degree to augment supplies, and declining precipitation will reduce aquifer recharge rates. Combined with increased demand due to population increases, higher crop demands, and lower soil moisture increased aquifer drawdown is likely to occur. With multiple potential threats to water quality and quantity in Arizona's future, it 48 \"Adapting Governance to Climate Change: Managing Uncertainty Through a Learning Infrastructure\", Camacho, 59 Emory L.J. 1, 6n.9 (2009) Palominas Water Recharge Project Water replenishment effort s in Cochise County are resulting in groundwater levels are rising near two recharge facilities along the upper San Pedro River. The facilities came online in 2002 and 2014 and combine to recharge almost 1 billion gallons of water back into the aquifer each year. Thanks to this success t he Cochise Conservation and Recharge Network - whose partners include the Conservancy, Cochise C ounty, the cities of Sierra Vista and Bisbee, and the Hereford Natural Resource Conservation District \u2014 plans to launch another project at Horseshoe Draw in 2018. That project will also recharge storm water and prevent destructive flooding and erosion down stream . Given extended drought, increasing the amount of water stored in the underground aquifer is a \"no regrets\" strategy for both local communities and the San Pedro River. pg. 63 is extremely important that land managers focus limited resources on actions that derive the most benefit , including vegetation treatments; conservation and ed ucati on; and management and policy. Benefits, Threats, and Impacts Benefits More than seven million people live in Arizona, many of whom depen d on water sources generated by runoff from precipitation on Arizona's watersheds . Crop production on Arizona's o ne million acres of cropland requir es a dependable supply of irrigation water . Arizona's aquatic ecosystems and riparian areas along streams and rivers are home to significant and diverse wildlife species, some of which are listed as endangered or threate ned species. In fact, riparian ecosystems are considered an endangered ecosystem type. Groundwater plays a critical role in main taining the health of riparian areas by sustaining stream and river base flows. Threats Persistent drought Climate change resu lting in variable precipitation and warming temperatures Overstocked forest and woodlands Expanding development and creation of impervious surfaces that leads to accelerated runoff Uncharacteristic wildfire and subsequent flooding Impacts Drought decreases availability of wa ter for agriculture, and industrial and municipal users. Climate change is causing variable precipitation resulting in reduced snow pack, lower runoff, and decreased flows in drainage basins. Many forest stands are overly dense and therefore co mpeting for already scarce water resources. Development of previously natural areas with impervious surfaces can negatively impact water quality and limit groundwater recharge. Uncharacteristic wildfire changes the landscape by removing natur al vegetation and making the soil impervious to water (i.e., hydrophobic soils). This results in flooding and soil erosion that reduces the stability of the watershed. Key Elements Climate and Water Precipitation is typically both greater and more dependable in Arizona's upper elevations, where most of our forests occur. pg. 64 Forested lands in Arizona contribute nearly 90% of the total streamflow in the state, much of which comes during spring snowmelt49. Ponderosa pine forests are the source for a substantial portion of the state's water. For example, while occupying only 20% of the total land surface of the Salt and Verde River basins, ponderosa pine fo rests account for almost 50% of the total water yield50. Forestlands also contribute additional, albeit unknown quantities of groundwater recharge. In much of Arizona's woodlands and coniferous forests, the number of trees per acre and the canopy cover have both increased to the point where very little herbaceous ground cover remains. Much of the precipitation is intercepted by the dense canopy (evaporating back to the atmosphere) or runs off bare soil. Water Yield Studies conducted in the Beaver Creek and C astle Creek watersheds show that selective forest treatments in ponderosa pine can increase water yield. o Untreated watersheds showed average annual water yield ranging from 2.7 -5.0 inches per acre (0.225 to 0.417 acre -feet). 49 \"Water yield improvement by vegetation management: focus on Arizona \"., Ffolliot t et. al., 1975, Prepared for Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, Contract/Grant no.: US For. Ser. 16/257/CA, OWRT 14 -31- 0001 -3803. School of renewable Natural Resources, University of Arizona, Tucson AZ. Ca. 1000 p. 50 \" Recovering rainfall \", Barr, G.W. 1956 , Technical Report. Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ Drought Contingency Planning Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed historic legislation ratifying Arizona's Drought Contingency Plan (DCP) on Jan. 31, 2019. The legislation allows Ar izona to join six other western states and Mexico in signing an inter -state water agreement and spells out ways Arizona will contribute to conserving more water from the Colorado River. Since July 28, 2018, 40 stakeholders (DCP Steering committee) represen ting diverse interests from across Arizona have worked to develop what is known as the Intrastate Drought Contingency Plan. The plan balances water reductions in the state to ensure no one user takes the entire burden. Two bills that enable Arizona to rati fy the Drought Contingency Plan are: One that authorizes ADWR Director Tom Buschatzke to sign onto the interstate Drought Contingency Plan on behalf of Arizona. The other allows for certain water stakeholders within Arizona to make agreements on water usag e rights and provides $30 million for Lake Mead conservation, $2 million for ground water conservation and $9 million for Pinal County agriculture infrastructure projects. pg. 65 o Clearing forests increased annu al yield by about 0.1 -0.2 acre -feet. o Thinning of ponderosa pine resulted in annual water yield gains of 0.61 to 1 inch per acre (0.051 to 0.083 acre -feet). Water yield gains from forest treatments in the Beaver Creek watersheds persisted for about six year s on both cleared and thinned forested watersheds, after which gains were negligible due to new vegetation growth. o Areas with a northern exposure or on a deeper soil profile will generally provide increased water yields for a longer time than south -facing slopes or sites with shallow soils. o Increased water yields from forest treatments might be sustained using fire to manage understory vegetation. However, scientific trials have not been conducted to test this hypothesis in the Southwest. Treated pinyon -juniper show smaller increases in water yield because they have relatively low runoff efficiency (proportion of annual precipitation converted to measurable streamflow). Average annual water yield from untreated pinyon juniper does not exceed 1 inch per acre (0.083 acre -feet). By contrast, water yield from untreated ponderosa pine is 3 to 5 times higher51 per acres. It is important to note the total untreated area of pinyon -juniper woodlands is 5 times more than the total area of ponderosa forests and could pro duce the same total water yield if treated. Increased snowpack water equivalent, which results in enhanced soil moisture and water yield, is one potential benefit of forest thinning. There are greater accumulations of snow in openings than in adjacent forest. This is partly due to snow interception by tree branches and subsequent evaporative losses (sublimation). Small openings (60 -160 feet in diameter) are optimal for snow accumulation compared to large openings (greater than 160 feet in diameter) where s un and wind exposure cause gre ater evaporation52. Soils, Erosion, and Sedimentation Soil compaction by logging equipment is a potential impact of mechanical forest management activities. Soil compaction could reduce water -holding capacity of the soil as wel l as infiltration rates , thereby increasing overland flow and surface erosion. If Best Management Practices (BMPs) are not followed, or suitability of equipment for various soil types, slope, and aspect is not considered during project planning and impleme ntation, these impacts can be exacerbated. Lack of consistent use of BMPs to reduce erosion and sediment discharge can have downstream impacts for fish and wildlife, water treatment costs, aesthetics, reservoir storage capacity, and possibly flood flows due to deposited sediment and debris blocking channels. o Soil's infiltration rate and ability to store nutrients and water is decreased by erosion. o Biotic productivity and hydrologic function are also impacted if soil health is not protected. Road construction and maintenance for forest management and recreational activities can be significant sources of sediment in upland watersheds. If the location and design of roads is not carefully considered, impacts as well as the potential for obliteration are increased. 51 \"Water yield improvement by vegetation management: focus on Arizona \"., Ffolliot t et. al., 1975, Prepared for Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station, Contract/Grant no.: US For .

Ffolliot 1975 pg. 66 Aquatic Systems/Riparian Areas Managing Arizona's forested riparian zones to optimize growth of native trees , shrubs and understory plants provide better protection against erosion for stream channels and stream banks. Water quality is enh anced by reduction of sediment and the improved ability o f the riparian area to act as a natural bio -filter nutrient rich sediment . Where appro priate, reduction of non -native invasive riparian plants ( e.g., salt cedar [ Tamarix spp.] and Russian olive [ Elaeagnus angustifolia ] among others) will improve the ability of Arizona's riparian forests to deliver water for downstream uses. Many of Arizona's forested riparian areas are impaired and no longer functioning properly (as determined by Proper Functioning Condition). Rather than protecting the water quali ty of streams , stream banks and channels are contributing to sedimentation and reduced water quality . This is resulting from changes in their geomorphology and other issues . In some area s, invasive riparian species ( e.g., salt cedar) domina te and impede deliv ery of water to downstream users.

Water quality and quantity is affected by conditions and activities on every acre in the state. However, there are regions of the state where management activities will most effectively address our critical resource issues. These regions are called foc us areas and priority landscapes. The process of landscape prioritization for water began w ith the identification of streams and lakes that are impaired based on the ADEQ Water Assessment. Next, the Outstanding Waters of Arizona were identified to provide a comparison with impaired areas. Then Riparian areas were over -laid on top of the groundwater basins. Finally, all 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) were identified along with the public land ownerships across the state.

Clean air, often taken for granted, is threatened by many factors; industrial and auto mobile emissions, dust from uncovered/tilled soil, smoke from increasing wildfire o ccurrence, and forest pile burning and prescribed fire activities. Th ese changes in air quality have resulted in wi despread impacts across Arizona. Introduction Air pollution has been a persistent problem since the Industrial age with much of it being traced to the use of fossil fuels to genera te energy. Even when not used for energy generation, hydrocarbons contribute to air pollution through the release of vapors from solvents, paints, and gasoline. One of the problems with air pollution is not only the diversity of its sources but also the fa ct that it is made up of so many pollutants which include; carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, ozone, and lead. Arizona's vegetation serves to maintain and enhance air quality in several ways. Trees modify the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide (providing a sink for carbon) and producing oxygen, and they clear the air by filtering dust, ash, pollen, and smoke (especially in urban areas). They also intercept wind, provide shade, and moderate air temperature. Conversely, plant life contributes to reduced air quality when smoke is produced by wildfires and other land management activities, especially prescribed burning. However, the air pollution issu es we are experiencing now cannot be solved just by increasing vegetation . Ozone Ozone is the prime ingredient of smog in our cities and industrial areas. When routinely inhaled even low levels of ozone can cause severe respiratory problems including asthma, temporary respiratory diseases, and temporary decreases in lung capa city. Even moderately exercising healthy adults can experience 15 - 20% reduction in lung function. Recent studies have indicated that repeated exposure to elevated levels of ozone over a period of time can result in permanent structural damage53. Those who a re most at risk to ozone are people who preform moderate activity during the summer months (i.e. outdoor workers). Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM) is the term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Particles are classified into two groups PM 10 (larger than 2.5 micrometers) and PM 2.5 (smaller than 2.5 micro meters). Though PM 10 has been linked to health impacts, PM 2.5 can cause significant health 53 \"Human Exposure Modeling - Air Pollutants Exposure Model \", Environmental Protection Agency, 2015, https://www.epa.gov/fera/human -exposure -modeling -air-pollutants -exposure -model Air quality affects every living thing in Arizona. As one of life's most crucial elements, air plays a critical role in sustaining Arizona's natural resources, its people and their quality of life. This element is substantially influenced by Arizona's urban and rural ecosystems. pg. 73 problems including; premature death, acute respiratory symptoms, aggravated asthma, bronchitis, and decreased lung function54. People who live in the Phoenix area are especially at risk due to several contributing factors and should heed public health warnings concerning air quality which is in part due to the number of people adjacent and the activities they perform. Benefits, Threats, and Impacts It is vital for the long -term health of all living thin gs that the lands in Arizona be managed to positively affect air quality. Benefits Clean air results in decreased numbers of respiratory illnesses. Through lowering cases of respiratory disorders linked to dirty air, clean air aids in lowering medical care costs. One acre of forested land absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen every day, which is enough to meet the annual needs of 18 people. Urban plant life reduces the impact of the urban heat island effect and lessen its impact on local weather patterns. Threats and Impacts Negative effects on huma n health such as asthma and other respiratory diseases Vegetation die -off in rural and urban areas due to air pollution. Limited visibility due to smoke or smog. Acid deposition resulting in the degradation of aquatic systems, vegetation, and cultural reso urces (stone work). Key Elements Climate and Air In many Arizona ecosystem s there is a lack of ground cover and low soil moisture, and more so as temperatures increase. These factors contribute to wind erosi on and airborne soil 54 \"Human Exposure Modeling - Air Pollutants Exposure Model \", Environmental Protection Agency, 2010, https://www.epa.gov/fera/human -exposure -modeling -air-pollutants -exposure -model Air Monitoring Network The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality conducts ambient air quality monitoring throughout Arizona. Environmental parameters measured in this monitoring network include criteria pollutants (lead, ozone, particulate matter \u2014 PM10 and PM2.5, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide) as well as air toxins. Air quality monitoring networks operate in urban and rural areas throughout Arizona. They provide local air quality conditions to the public and help identify the causes of air pollution. The networks are composed of individual monitoring sites that collect ambient air quality data in a variety of settings. The results determine if public health standards are met and allow scientists to assess the effects of pollution on public health and welfare . pg. 74 particles. Vegetation help s cleanse the air by intercepting airborne particles and absorbing pollutants. Quality of life in desert metropol itan areas like Phoenix is degraded by the heat island effect. ln these urban areas, a preponderance of concrete and asphalt absorbs and holds he at, thus dramatically increasing air temperatures in contrast to nearby rural areas. This heating and related drying can alter weather patterns, resulting in a more arid climate. Urban trees and forests lessen the heat island effect by cooling the air thro ugh shade and transpiration, reducing air temperatures by as much as 15 degrees and utility bills by 15 -50%. The evaporation from a single large tree can produce the cooling effect of 10 room -size air conditioners operating 20 hours a day . Smoke Uncharacteristic wildfires have become common in Arizona's coniferous forests, creat ing a situation where forests may have become a generator of greenhouse gas and other pollutants rather than a sink for carbon storage. When naturally ignited wildfires are managed for specific resource benefit objectives, operations result in a healthier ecosystem, which in the end will produce lower emissions than would occur with an uncharacteristically severe wildfire. Constraints from public intolerance of smoke and air quality restrictions may limit the application of prescribed fire to mainta in and s ustain Arizona's fire- adapted ecosystems. Best Management Practice s (BMPs) Smoke management should be an important consideration when planning all prescribed burns. Smoke can obstruct visibility, which in turn can affect the safety of the personnel conduc ting the fire, public safety on roadways, and the recreational value of areas. Smoke can also impact public health, along with the public's reaction to prescribed burning in general. The main goals of smoke management are to reduce emissions from a fire, as well as identifying and listing smoke sensitive area s around the burn unit and what wind direction and dispersion conditions will be needed to reduce smoke impacts. This will in turn improve the dispersion of smoke, and make sure smoke plumes do not affe ct smoke -sensitive areas. Burn when weather conditions are likely to produce the best dispersion: AZ Smoke Manag ement Program The Arizona Department of Environmental Qualities' (ADEQ) Air Quality Division implements a Smoke Management Plan that works toward a reduction in smoke impacts due to prescribed/controlled burning of nonagricultural fuels with particular regard to heavy forest fuels. All state lands, parks and forests, as well as any federally managed lands in Arizona, are under the jurisdiction of ADEQ in matters relating to air pollution from prescribed burning. ADEQ's Web site contains up -to-date inform ation on prescribed fire approvals, contact information, smoke advisories, and general information about smoke: www.azdeq.gov/environ/air/smoke/fires.html pg. 75 Burn when atmospheric conditions are best for rapid smoke dispersal; this is normally after the morning inversion layer has broken and before the evening inve rsion layer forms. Consider air pollution regulations and do not burn during pollution alerts, stagnant conditions, or ozone alert days. Consider down -drainage smoke flow, especially in complex terrain where downslope winds prevail at nighttime under light wind conditions. Burn when fuel conditions are likely to produce the least amount of smoke : Burn with proper fuel moisture conditions. Use test fires prior to burning to confirm fuel conditions and smoke behavior before igniting the entire unit. Estimate the amount of smoke the fuels will produce. o Fuel type will make a difference in emission rates; fuels that have high moisture contents, high concentration of oils, or large fuel particle size will have higher rates of smoke emissions. Utilize suitable ignition techniques for smoke management: Consider burning using backfires to reduce the amount of smoke produced. Use mass ignition techniques to create greater amounts of heat, which will create more lift for the smoke column. Conduct post -burn mop -up to reduce nuisance smoke: Outline what actions will be taken after the burn to reduce residual smoke. If residual smoke problems from logs, brush piles, snags or stumps may occur , take steps to keep them from burning. If post -burn smoke could be a problem, be sure to monitor the burn unit and have personnel in place to suppress any fuels that begin to smolder. Reduce the amount of fuels to reduce smoke emissions: Use periodic maintenance -type prescribed burns that follow historic natural fire return intervals. Perform hand or mechanized thinning of vegetation before attempting a prescribed burn. Reduce the impact of smoke on people: Notify all people that could possibly be affected downwind, such as nearby residents, adjacent landowners, fire departm ents, and local fire control offices. Infor m smoke sensitive persons how to avoid smoke exposure. Mop -up along roads as soon as possible and pay special at tention where smoke can travel downslope or down drainage. Use appropriate signage to inform the pub lic about areas where smoke will impact them, such as highways, secondary roads, trails and campgrounds. Initiate public education or public relations efforts prior to conducting burns. Atmospheric Carbon pg. 76 Carbon is sequestered in the biomass of vegetation, which prevents its release into the earth's atmosphere. Over time however, biomass will decay releasing carbon but due to Arizona's dry climate this occurs at a rather slow rate. Large, high intensity wildfires release massive quantities of carbon and other particulates into the atmosphere. Natural resource management and burning of hazard ous fuels have smaller, more controlled releases of carbon than uncharacteristically severe wildfires. These smaller releases are offset in part by vegetative response s and resource benefits. Dust Since the start of 2008, most exceedances of the PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the nonattainment area s of Arizona have been related to high wind events. High win d events, along with othe r meteorologica l conditions lead ing to the generation of dust can be predicted through meteorological forecasts. Dust particles are very small and can be easily inhaled. They can enter the respiratory system and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections, and ag gravate cardio -pulmonary disease. Even short -term exposure to dust can cause wheezing, asthma attacks and allergic reactions, and may cause increases in hospital adm issions and emergency room visits for heart and lung related diseases. Dust emissions can cause significant environmental impacts as well as health effects. When dust from wind erosion or human activity deposits out of the air, it may impact vegetation, adversely affect nearby soils and waterways, and cause damage to cultural resources. Wi nd erosion can result in the loss of valuable top soil, reduce crop yields, and stunt plant growth. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), studies have linked particulate matter exposure to health problems and environmental impacts suc h as: Health Impacts: o Irritation of the airways, coughin g, and difficulty breathing reducing lung function and lung cancer o Aggravated asthma and chronic bronchitis o Irregular heartbeat and increases in heart attacks Environmental Impacts: h aze and reduced visibility o Reduced levels of nutrients in soil s Best management practices (BMP's) for controlling dust emissions to prevent or mitigate impacts to air quality and sourc es occurring within Arizona are listed below . The objective of the dus t cont rol measures are to reduce dust emissions from human activities and to prevent those emissions from impacting others. BMP's 1. Minimize disturbed area: plan the project or activity so that the minimum amount of disturbed soil or surface area is exposed to wind or vehicle traffic at any one time. 2. Reduce vehicle speeds: establish a maximum speed limit or install traffic calming devic es to reduce speeds to mitigate off -property transport of dust entrained by vehicles. pg. 77 3. Minimize drop height: Drivers and op erators shall unload truck beds and loader or excavator buckets slowly, and minimize drop height of materials to the lowest height possible, including screening operations. 4. High winds restriction: temporarily halt work activities during high wind events greater than 30 mph if operations would result in off -property transport. 5. Restrict access: restrict access to the work area to only authorized vehicles and personnel. Additional BMP's 1. Wet suppression: apply water to disturbed soil surfaces, backfill mater ials, screenings, and other dust generating operations as necessary and appropriate considering current weather conditions, and prevent water used for dust control from entering any public right -of-way, storm water drainage facility, or watercourse. 2. Wind barrier: construct a fence or other type of wind barrier to prevent wind erosion of top soils. 3. Vegetation: plant vegetation appropriate for retaining soils or creating a windbreak . 4. Surface roughening: stabilize an active construction area during per iods of inactivity or when vegetation cannot be immediately established. 5. Cover: install cover materials during periods of inactivity and properly anchor the cover. 6. Soil retention: stabilize disturbed or exposed soil surface areas that will be inactive for more than 30 days or while vegetation is being established.

Key Partners/Stakeholders Many of the partners and stakeholders listed have a potential role in supporting implementation of this strategy. A few entities stand out as being critical to succ ess: Arizona Department of Environmental Quality University of Arizona Bureau of L and Management National Forest Service pg. 78 Arizona State Land Department Natural Resource Conservation Service The Nature Conservancy Bureau of Indian Affairs Focus Areas Focus areas for Air were created by prioritizing HUC 8 watersheds that contained Class 1 areas, PM10 concerns, or Ozone concerns. The rational behind choosing these layers to determine priority is that they are one, the national standard, and two, if peopl e know where there are air quality issues they are more likely to take preventative measures. Shade tree prioritization mapping was also used to determine priority areas since the main goal of this type of mapping is to improve air quality through increase d biomass in urban areas. A color gradient was used based on how many of these concerns a watershed contained. Also displayed are Arizona airsheds however, they have no impact on which watersheds were prioritized . PM10 and Class 1 Areas : PM10 is a classification for inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller. Class 1 federal lands include areas such as national parks, national wilderness areas, and national monuments. These areas are granted special air quality protections under Section 162(a) of the federal Clean Air Act. Ozone: Ozone nonattainment area s are area s considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1 970. pg. 79 Airsheds: An airshed is a part of the atmosphere that behaves in a coherent way with respect to the dispersion of emissions. pg. 80 pg. 81 Goals, Objectives, and Actions The Strategy Team identified two (2) goals, five (5) objectives, and nineteen (19) actions for Air.

Current trends show increasing, severity, and occurrence of wildland fires and increasing costs for fighting and managing these fires. Although natural f ire is necessary in many vegetation types, it can occur as desirable fire, undesirable fire, or as a managed tool for achieving and sustaining desired ecological conditions. We know fire is a key p rocess in many ecosystems and reestablishing natural fire regimes where appropriate is an ongoing challenge. At the same time, protecting the safety of cit izens and other important values --communities, infrastructure, and habitat for imperiled species --is a critical concern. A fundamental challenge facing Arizona is maximizing the many benefits of fire while reducing its significant costs. Introduction Many ecosystems in Arizona are dependent on a relatively frequent fire return interval for their existence - -usually 5 -30 years. However, many ecosystems and fire regimes have be en altered from a natural condition due to urban encroachment, invasive plants, gra zing, logging, and decades of fire exclusion. These conditions also affect the use of prescribed fire as a management tool. Climate change research poses a further threat with increased drought and longer, warmer summers lengthening fire seasons. Climatic change suggests a greater number of intense, resistant to control fires that will likely place communities and landscapes at greater risk. A foundational principle in the issue of fire is not if Arizona will bur n, but when . Key Elements Fire is an essential natural process that provi des maintenance of ecosystem health while creating significant threats to values at the same time. Wildland wildfires cost land management agencies hundreds of millions of dollars per year for suppression. However, f ire is also used extensively as a cost - efficient resource management tool through the application of prescribed burning or through utilizing wildfire for resource benefit. A wildfire is in an unplanned ignition or prescribed fire that is declared a wildfi re managed for one o r mo re objectives that can be change d as the fire spreads across the la ndscape. Objectives are influenced by changes in fuels, weather, topography; varying social understanding and tolerance; and involvement of other governmental jurisd ictions having different missions and objectives. Initial attack on human -caused wildfire will be to suppress the fire at the lowest cost with the fewest negative consequences with respect to firefighter and public safety. However, managers will use a deci sion support process to guide and document wildfire management decisions. The process will provide situational assessment, analyze hazards and risk, define implementation actions, and document decisions and rationale for those decisions. A key element in the fire equation is smoke. Smoke from wildland fires contributes significant amounts of particulates and gasses into the atmosphere . While smoke from wildfires may not always be manageable, fire managers should try to use smoke management objectives whene ver possible in fire management support documents. S moke management for all prescribed burning events is a primary factor in determining how much, when, and where such fire is allowed. Smoke can affect the local environment as pg. 84 well as transporting to dist ant communities. In addition to temporarily reducing air quality, prescribed burning may also decrease visibility and negatively affect sensitive populations with respiratory conditions or certain health concerns. Given the knowledge that there are signifi cant diffe rences in the amount and duration of emissions from wildfires and prescribed burns , land managers would prefer to create smoke under optimum conditions to maximize dispersal and minimize impacts. Land managers are constantly assessing the potential for high intensity fire and planning how to manage it. By implemen ting appropriate steps to lessen the fuel hazard around communities and other values at risk, they reduce the threat. By developing and Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPP) , local governments have been doing their part to reduce risk, and prepare citizens and infrastructure. Many citizens have also protected private property by adopting fire mitigation building principles and creat ing defensible space around their homes. Because we have chosen to live and recreate in fire -dependent ecosystems, preparation and protection at all levels is essential. Benefits, Threats, and Impacts Wildfire : An unplanned, unwanted wildland fire includin g unauthorized human -caused fires, escaped wildland fire use events, escaped prescribed fire projects, and all other wildland fires where the objective is to put the fire out. Benefits Restores fire to its natural role in fire dependent ecosystems Brings i mprovements to ecosystem health Reduce risks to communities (e.g., loss of life, property and infrastructure damage, damage to economically viable natural resources) Promotes diversity of fire -dependent species Creates partnerships among federal and state agencies, tribal governments, fire departments, communities, and landowners Reduces accumulation of vegetation and litter that can inhibit plant growth Mayer Fuel Break In 2015, State Forestry and Fire installed a 270 -acre fuel break west of Mayer. The project consisted of manipulating the fuel stand and removing as much vegetation as possible to change a potential fire's behavior. In 2017, the Goodwin fire, originating in the Prescott National For est, burned roughly 20,000 acres south of Prescott. Due to fire intensity and high winds, the Goodwin fire was on track burn through Mayer before the fuel break installed in 2015 halted its advance. The fuel break allowed the fire to stop itself before mov ing into Mayer, thus it changed its course and headed away from the community. Fuels reduction projects, like the one in Mayer help reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, allow firefighters to manage suppression efforts more efficiently, and save lives . pg. 85 Stimulates growth and reproduction of some plants, while sustaining and maintaining wildlife habitat fo r some animals Contribute s to integrated management of resources (wildland fire use for resource benefit when used/coordinated with planned mechanical treatments) and potential reduction in restoration treatment costs Threats and Impacts Potential for loss of life Property and infrastructure loss and damage Negative impacts to resource values Damage to ecosystem function, health, and diversity Increasing costs of suppression and management of wildfires Loss and/or damage to wildlife habitat Loss of recreati on opportunities and values Negative impacts to local economies, cultural/heritage sites, watersheds, and air quality Loss of old -growth vegetation for wildlife habitat Prescribed Fire : Any fire intentionally ignited following management actions in accorda nce with applicable laws, policies, and regulations to meet specific objectives. Benefits Hazardous fuel reduction lowers the risk of major life -threatening wildfire and reduces the threat of substantial economic losses of resources and infrastructure. Prepares areas for the seeding or planting process and encourages natural regeneration by exposing mineral soil. Lessens the need for mechanical thinning which has a higher cost and more negative impact on soils. Controls the spread of disease by eliminat ing infected trees and parasites. Improves wildlife habitat by increasing browse and br owse quality, opening areas for feeding and travel corridors, and stimulates vegetative ground cover. Improves rangeland s by releasing dormant, standing veget ation resu lting in increased nutritive value of subsequent re -growth. Restores and maintains biological communities through reintroduction of fire . Threats and Impacts Air quality impacts to communities from smoke and emissions Risk of escape with the potential for negative impacts to communities and natural resources Impacts to vegetative structure that may preclude management goals and objectives from being met Costs of implementation (less reduced/displaced management costs) Prescribed Fire Best Management Practi ces BMPs for Planning and Burning pg. 86 Burn according to specific site and weather conditions to achieve the desired results while protecting water quality. Retain a light duff layer on the soil surface to allow water to slow and absorb into the ground, whil e still meeting the goals of the prescribed burn. Keep high intensity burns out of stream management zones ( SMZ ) unless suitable measures are used to e nsure protection of water quality. When conditions allow, use natural or existing barriers such as roads, canals, utility rights -of-way, streams, lakes, or wetlands to minimize the need for new fireline construction. The type and location of firebreaks or fire lines should be clearly noted on the burn plan and/or map. BMPs for Firelin e Construction Construct firelines only as deep and/or wide as necessary to contain the prescribed fire. Minimize using soil disturbing tractor -plow firelines if conditions allow. Construct firelines in a way that minimizes erosion and prevents runoff from directly entering waterbodies by installing and maintaining water bars, se diment traps, turnouts, or other appropriate methods. When site conditions or burning techniques are suitable, construct firelines along the contour and avoid straight uphill/ downhill placement. Fireline slope should be kept to 25 percent or less if possible. Try to keep constructed firelines out of SMZs, marshes or other environmentally sensitive areas. If a constructed fireline is needed in these areas, avoid using heavy equipment. BMPs for Fireline Maintenance Maintain erosion control structures to control runoff on firelines. Provide adequate cross -drainage where needed to avoid damming surface runoff. Minimize accelerated erosion into waterbodies and stabilize those ar eas that pose a risk to water quality. Clear streams and ditches of debris that was pushed in by fire equipment. Revegetate and/or stabilize firelines that pose a risk of accelerated erosion to waterbodies. BMPs for Wildfire Control Expose no more groun d surface than is necessary to control the fire. Protect surface waters such as streams, rivers and other waterbodies from polluted or pg. 87 sediment -rich runoff. Minimize soil disturbance along streambanks and within SMZs or riparian buffers. Avoid crossing streams with heavy equipment unless necessary. Keep fire -retardant chemicals out of SMZs, riparian buffers or waterbodies as conditions allow. Clean and mai ntain firefighting equipment away from SMZs, riparian buffers or waterbodies. If water retention areas are constructed, they should be returned to their pre -existing grade or hydrology as close as possible after they are no longer needed. Stabilize and /or retire firelines and access trails or roads created to control the wildfire. Consider installing suitable water (runoff) diver sions . Establish groundcover, re -vegetate or stabilize areas that are a considerable risk of accelerated erosion. Resource Needs Fiscal Allocation Agency budgets need to be stabilized to allow land management agencies to be proactive in approaching fire planning and treatments. Enhance interagency Joint Powe rs Agreement for transferring funds for non - suppression (fuels managem ent, prescribed fire, prevention, education/outreach, and public information) activities. Personnel/Response More personnel and resources to work across all land ownerships. More personnel and resources to provide adequate wildfire management response. Training/Outreach Additional training opportunities for wildland firefighters. Continued support for the Arizona Wildfire and Incident Management Academy. Improve the awareness and education of private property owners that the combustibility of their prope rty is th eir responsibility; more private property owners should be provided site -specific recommendations on reducing combustibility. Science and Research Continuing support of research for the benefits and costs of managed wildfire and prescribed fire e ffects. Fuels Management Development of additional industrial capacity to utilize biomass from treatment areas. Smoke and poor air quality from all fires must be addressed by working with ADEQ to stay within the state's identified requirements. pg. 88 Continue t o accomplish fuel reduction work in high priority fuel and fire hazard areas. Establish and maintain fire -safe zones around critical infrastructure. Fire Use Manage natural ignitions and/or planned ignitions to help restore n atural habitat diversity and other resource benefits. Key Partners and Stakeholders Many of the partners and st akeholders listed below have a potential role in supporting implementation of this strategy. A few entities stand out as being critical to success: Organizations like the Ponderosa Fire Advisory Council, and Rural Communities Fire Management Partnership Fire departments, fire districts, and fire management organiz ations Arizona I nteragency Coordination Group (AICG) All federal agencies involved in fire management - USDA Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, US Fish and Wildlife Service. All state agencies involv ed in fire - ADEQ, DFFM, State Land Department, and th e Game and Fish Department . Focus Areas Focus landscapes for the Fi re issue were developed from Four (4) primary data sets: 1) Wildfire Risk as developed in the Wildland Wide Assessment, 2) Identified Comm unities at Risk , 3) Community Wildfire Protection Plans , and 4) Cross -Boundary Fireshed analysis. Areas of highest wildfire risk were used to create the Focus Area map. We identified the different HUC 10s across the state where wildfire risk was highest and created a gradient showing which HUCs had the most risk. The gradient runs from 2,000 acres of high wildfire risk per HUC to 110,000 acres of high wildfire risk per HUC. Cross -Boundary Fire Risk Using advanced modeling tools, we can now understand cross -boundary fire risk issues across a \"fireshed\" \u2014the area of fire risk around a community or other point of value \u2014 including the contributions that individual land parcels make to community wildfire risk. We can map firesheds around communities and other values to locate hotspots of fire transmission. In the Western United States, for example, scientists have mapped the core firesheds that are respons ible for some 80 percent of the potential future community exposure from wildfires ignited on the National Forest System . Core firesheds (orange) that potentially transmit fire to the exposed communities (blue) adjacent to national forests. These core firesheds account for 80 percent of the total potential fire from the National Forest System to communities in the Western United States. pg. 89 Community Wi ldfire Protection Plans: More than 30 CWPPs have been complete d within Arizona. This data is m aintained by the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management (DFFM). Wildfire Risk: The Arizona Wildfire Risk Asses sment Portal (AzWRAP) identifies areas of high and medium risk by incorporating his torical fire occurance, fire regime condition class, and fuels type. AzWRAP can be found online at arizonawildfirerisk.com Communities at Risk : DFFM has identified over 400 communities across Arizona that are at risk from wildfire. The communities identified on the map are at medium or high risk. Cross -Boundary Fireshed: Analysis provides a framework for assessing cross -boundary wildfire exposure using FSim simulation outputs to (1) estimate c ross-boundary wildfire (2) quantify structure exposure to Arizona communities; (3) map sources of community wildfire exposure (firesheds); (4) characterize firesheds in terms of management opportunity and fuels; and (5) prioritize communities based on integration of exposure and fireshed characteristics. Results identified the top 10 firesheds in Arizona. pg. 90 pg. 91 Goal, Objectives, and Actions The Strategy Team identified f our (4) goals, ten (10) objectives, and forty -one (41) actions for the Fire issue.

Historically, forests have provided an abundance of natural resources --forage for cattle a nd sheep; trees for lumber, firewood, mine timbers and railroad ties; game for consumption; and water for irrigation and municipal uses. Forests have sustained a timber industry fueling a century of rural development. Although tourism, watershed protection , and evolving forest man agement goals have provided new challenges for rural and state economies, the importance of forests to Arizona's economy has not changed. Forests remain the economic and aesthetic foundation of many rural communities. Today, Arizon ans demand more goods and services from our forests than ever before and balancing these demands presents ongoing management challenges as we strive to ensure long -term forest sustainability. *When referencing forests, we also include woodlands, grassland s, and riparian areas. Introduction Arizona forests sustained a timber industry that helped support a century of rural development. In the 1990s, changes in economic conditions, environmental concerns, an overall reduction of large trees, and a shift to recyc led paper caused a sharp decline in the logging industry (Figure 1 and Table 1) . The current low value of non -commercial timber has challenged government agencies on how to have these low v alue products removed from the f orest. Select areas can still support timber sale contracts, while other areas have agencies pay loggers for thinning small -diameter trees and removing woody biomass ( providing hazardous fuel reduction of non -merchantable materials ). Additionally, many other treatments conducted for r estoration and fuels purposes within a timber sale area add costs , which outweigh the value of the wood products removed. Figure 1.

Tourism, second home development, watershed protection, and evolving fores t management goals have provided new challenges and opportunities for local and reg ional economies. The primary importance of forests to Arizona's economy is shifting from logging and resource extraction to amenity based values. Forests remain the economic and aesthetic foundation of many rural communities , especially along the Mogollon Rim. Declining ecosystem health has adversely affected economic conditions, primarily from threats associated with wildland fire activity, insect and disease activity, and forest fragmentation on private lands.

Operating Sawmills in Arizona, 1996 -201255 With continued population growth across the state, our reliance on healthy, sustainable forests is even more critical. Today, Arizonans demand more goods and services from our forests than ever before and balancing these demands and associated impacts presents ongoing ma nagement challenges as we strive to ensure long -term forest sustainability. The importance of developing infrastructure, sustained employment opportunities and markets for the by -products of forest restoration is critical in maintaining forest -based econom ic sustainability. There are also opportunities to solve other statewide issues, such as increasing energy needs, through development of wood -to-energy facilities. Figure 4.

Industry -supported, landscape -level treatments to maintain healthy forest conditions while sustaining and promoting economic benefits support of a rura l green economy (ecosystem services). 3. Development of local industry to provide reliable local markets for forest biomass. 4. Private land management and the sale of private in holdings for development. Presently, there is inadequate logging and wood -processi ng infrastructure and markets to support an economically feasible, large -scale forest restoration effort. Although , some efforts have been made to initiate larger -scale management [the White Mountain Stewardship Integrated Resource Service Contract (WMSIRS C) Project57 and the Four Forest Restoration Initiative Integrated Resource Service Contract (4FRI 56 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Journal of Forestry, ($) Year pg. 98 IRSC) ], there is a need to understand the effe ctiveness of these projects, expand successful efforts , and improve the ability to accomplish more restoration . The historical forest products industry in northern Arizona was based on large -tree logging for timber and small tree/pre -commercial thinning for pulp. The permanent closure of large -log sawmills in northern Arizona (Southwest Forest Industries in Eagar, S tone Container sawmill in Flagstaff, Kaibab Industries in Fredonia and Payson) combined with the pulp mill in Snowflake switching exclusively to recycle d pulp in the mid -1990s made the market for forest logs to decline precipitously. Som e small -scale indus tries remained , including firewood, p osts and poles, pallets, vigas, specialty lumber, and the like. Remaining industries and a few new ones processed what little wood was being cut and removed by a small number of logging operations. In the early 2000's there was the deve lopment of woody biomass manufacturing facilities in eastern Arizona. A 27MW biomass fueled e lectrical generating station built in Snowflake could utilize whole -tree chips generated from logging slash and grassland restoration projects. A s part of the White Mountain Stewardship Project, a residential wood pellet manufacturing plant in Show Low was commissioned to utilize whitewood chips from small diameter ponderosa pine trees that were debarked in the forest. Acres of Timber Sales Sold by the US Forest Service 2005 -201758 Since 2005, 75% of acres awarded by the Forest Service in Arizona were contracts that the Forest Service sold, with 25% sales that the Forest Service had to subsidize t he removal of forest products. The majority of the a cres that have been subsidized are associated with the White Mountain stewardship contract. By the mid -2000s, several operations (Southwest Forest Products, High Desert Investment) began bidding on timber sales again in the Western Mogollon Rim area , and the White Mountain Stewardship Contract revitalized several operations in the eastern Mogollon Rim area . However, the recession of 2007 -2010 58 Source: US Forest Service TIM database, query ran February 26, 2018 Acres Sold by Fiscal Year (October-1 to September 30) Forest/Sold or Paid 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 TOTAL % by 132,438 90% FS paid 0 4,930 2,300 1,200 0 0 0 0 220 0 0 0 6,837 15,487 10% Coronado 27 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 186 0 11,500 0 11,713 100% FS sold 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 186 0 0 0 186 2% FS paid 27 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11,500 0 paid 0 0 0 0 9,500 0 0 0 0 0 paid 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 FS paid 0 0 0 0 0 11,000 0 0 952 0 0 0 0 11,952 26% affected most operations and demonstrated how a diverse business cluster of forest -based enterprises is needed to offset fluctuations in market conditions. Currently, successful industry efforts are centered in the White Mountains, with Tri -Star Logging and Novo -BioPower creating a restoration based industry (Novo -Star) that combines saw timber products with biomass removal that is centered around a biomass fueled electrical generating station. The value -added concept displayed by Novo -Star is a model that illustrates how mult iple manufacturing processes are necessary to incentivize investment in low value products. Also illustrated at the Novo -Star facility is how public policy through the Arizona Corporation Commission's Renewable Energy Portfolio can support forest restoration by allowing utility companies to purchase renewable e nergy from a variety of sources. Additionally Forest Energy, LLC; the offtake partner for the White Mountain Stewardship Project continues to operate in the White Mountains. The fiber source for Forest Energy, LLC has diversified and now i ncludes sawmill waste from sawmills in the area and a mix of fiber from the National Forest System and tribal lands. Restoration of forests altered by fire suppression, commercial logging, past grazing practices , mining, road building, insects and diseases , invasive species, and intensive recreation is a high priority on all forestland in Arizona. Of particular concern is the inability of forests altered by these factors to withstand otherwise natural disturbances such as fire, flooding, and insect outbreak s. There is a great need to restore self - maintaining, resilient ecosystems within the forested lan dscape. To accomplish this there is a need to create opportunities for an innovative sustainable industry that will facilitate economically feasible forest re storation efforts and provide economic support to communities and counties. Key to this is the identification of appropriate landscapes that would be most beneficial to development of industry. Such economic development could also partially underwrite cost s to federal agencies for ramping up landscape -scale restoration. Restored forested landscapes can serve as major attraction s for a variety of amenity based services and recreation, hunting, tourism, scenic backdrops for residential homes --all of which con tribute substantially to the economic vitality of Arizona. Amenity -based services include provisioning services such as food, water, timber, and fiber; regulating services that affect climate, flood, disease, wastes, and water quality; Novo BioPower Novo BioPower is a renewable energy company engaged in biomass power generation utilizing wood waste as a primary fuel source. Novo Biopower operates a 27 megawatt biomass power plant located in Snowflake, Arizona, approximately 180 miles Northeast of Phoe nix. The Novo Plant has two long -term power purchase agreements in place with Arizona Public Services (APS) and Salt River Project (SRP), Arizona's two largest electric utilities. The power plant is a key component to the 4FRI effort due to it processing m uch of the biomass coming off the project area. pg. 100 cultural services th at provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soils formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling. Note that the benefits of ecosystem services are not always directly tied to the forest or woodland landscape . In the case of water quality, the beneficial users are sometimes hundreds of miles downstream in the lar ge metropolitan areas of Phoenix . The economic value of these \"ecosystem services\" is considerable and may outweigh values associated with resource e xtraction by a factor of 100:159. Figure 6. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) associated with Forestry, Fishing, and Related Activities (NAICS 113, NAICS 114 ), 1997 - 201560 A current lack of industry poses a barrier to accomplishing economically viable treatment of these landscapes. Without treatment , these landscapes are at elevated risk for unnatural, stand replacing fires and other ecosystem health risks. Ecosystem services emanate as a co ntinual flow of economic value from healthy forests. If healthy forests are reduced, degraded, or irreversibly damaged , the flow of ecosystem services is diminished. This reduction of ecosyste m services can limit the economies of communities and businesses depend ing on the se services. Key to this is the identification of specific landscapes that contribute to the economic well-being of local communities and/or regional entities. Ecosystem services provided by forested lands also i ncludes private lands and their management as an integral p art. The contributions from private property are often viewed as free benefits to socie ty. Consequently, their beneficial contributions are often overlooked in public, corporate, and individual decision -making . When foreste d lands are undervalued, they can be susceptible to development 59 \" Economic Reasons for Conserving Wild Nature \", Science's Compass Review, Balmford et al., 2002, http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/297/5583/950.full.pdf 60 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

As these working forest in -holdings are removed from the contiguous forested landscape, that landscape becomes more fragmented. Impacts go beyond the private land. Consequences include the loss of public benefits or the marginalization of those benefits provided by contiguous forested landscapes. In addition to residential, commercial, and industrial development on what was forested land, and their asso ciated influence as a new wildland urban interface, there is the expansion of utility infrastructure and transportation networks into forests . The National Forest Foundation (NFF) announced recently that it submitted an innovative carbon offset methodology to the American Carbon Registry for approval. Once approved, the proposed methodology will allow for the generation of verified carbon offsets from forest restoration projects on National Forest lands in the southwestern U.S. This methodology is the first of its kind and will help advance forest restoration activities aimed at reducing the risk of high severity fires in the region. Using the methodology, investors will be able to financially support forest restoration activities, such as those planned unde r northern Arizona's Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), in exchange for verified carbon offsets61. Forested regions are desirable places to live and Arizona's population grew by nearly 40% from 2010 to 201562. The impact of this rapid growth shows up on the landscape as urbanization --conversion of rural open space to urban use by the sale of private land parcels to accommodate development.

There can be a short -term economic boost from reconstruction efforts, fire suppression and restoration jobs. However, there is an offsetti ng cost to taxpayers, insurance companies, business es and property owners. There is a long -term economic impact associated with loss of the forest environment. Water & Air Quality - Economic impacts of water and air quality cannot be overstated. The ecosys tem services of healthy watersheds and the delivery of water from forests and woodlands is a driver of economies hundreds of miles from their location. People - Discussion of this issue includes recreation and urban forestry. However, there is also a need to address the impacts and benefits of individuals who depend on forestlands for a living (i.e., ranchers, outfitter/guides, land management agency personnel, etc.). Ecosystem Health - Landscapes threatened with d eclining ecosystem health are also areas wh ere industry needs and amenity values are linked. Climate Change - As climate change influences forests, there will be correspon ding changes to economic issues and opportunities. 63 Combrink, Thomas; Cothran, Cheryl; Fox, Wayne; Peterson, Jeff; Snider, Gary. 2013.

The climate across these landscapes has experienced wide swings in temperature and precipitation for thousands of years. A naturally variable climate has given rise to changes in fire frequency, wide variation in flood and drought severity, and has influenced Native American population shifts throughout the region. While climate has always been variable, rapid climate change crea tes cascading effects that are alter ing Arizona's landscapes . Recent drought conditions due to natural variability and increasing temperatures tied to rising levels or greenhouse gasses have decreased vegetative productivity, reduced water availability, caused a shift in established vegetation/wildlife ranges, and contributed to some of the largest wildfires in Arizona's history. Though there could also be some positive impacts of climat e change, the ecological changes projected to occur will be predominately negative. Virtually all natural resources in Arizona will be affected by climate change ; in this report, we will focus on six factors , which are broadly represented across Arizona's diverse landscapes. Fire behavior/severity Water availability Wildlife habitat Vegetative p roductivity Ecological c hanges (conversion of vegetation types and relationships) Carbon sequestration 1. Fire behavior/severity An increasingly hot and dry Arizona has already resulted in the lengthening of the fire season. From 1973 to 2013 the fire season across the planet has increased by 19%64; in the American West, this increase averaged more than 84 days longer in 2003 -2012, compared to the period 1973 -198265. This increase has also affected the number, severity, and siz e of wildfires. More fuel is available for burning due to over a hundred years of fire suppression by land managem ent agencies. Once ignited large fuel loads are resulting in very large and intense fires, which have important implications for communities, ecosystems, and air quality and fire suppression expenditures66. These unnaturally severe fires change the la ndscape drastically, imperil lives and property, and cost a lot to suppress. Land managers in Arizona have taken several different approaches to address the issue of fire behavior and severity. One of these tools is the reduction of fuel loads through various fuels treatments. Generally, 64 \"Climate -induced variations in global wildfire danger from 1979 to 2013 \", Jolly et.al., Nature Communications 6, Article number: 7537 (2015), doi: 10.1038/ncomms8537 65 \"Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring \", Anthony LeRoy Westerling , The Royal Society Publishing, Published 23 May 2016.DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2015.0178 66 \"Climate change presents incr eased potential for very large fires in the contiguous United States\", R. Barbero et. Al., International Journal of Wildland Fire 2015, 24, 892 -899 http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF15083 pg. 111 this results in the reduction of fuels on th e ground as well as ladder fuels ( lower limbs and branches). These treatments may also require selectively thinning out dense stands of younger trees and protecting mature -sized trees. Fuels reduction can be accomplished using prescribed fire, biological m ethods (i.e. grazing) , and mechanical and/or chemical treatments to remove or modify fuels. Of these methods, prescribed fire is the one with the highest potential , and the lowest cost per acre . With proper design and implementation , prescribed fire can re duce hazardous fuels, minimize invasive plants and disease, improve habitat, recycle nutrients, and promote beneficial post -fire vegetation growth. Land managers can also take an indirect approach to fuels treatments through programs like FireWise and th e Commu nity Wildfire Protection Plan program . The FireWise progr am teaches people how to live with wildfire by making their homes and property fire resistant. Community programs often have three basic parts; collaboratively developed plans by local and sta te partners; prioritizing areas for fuels reduction; and specific recommendations that homeowners and communities can take to reduce threats to structures from wildfires. These approaches work with people to help them understand and implement steps they ca n take to create a more fire -resilient landscape. 2. Water availability Global climate models project more dry days and drier soils in the future, for much of the Southwest. Along with projected warming and increased evapotranspiration, this likely means dr oughts will become more severe67. Research findi ngs based on high emissions scenarios, suggest long -term droughts will become more common by the second half of this century, and future droughts will be much more severe than those previously recorded will . Intensified Colorado River drought conditions are not fully due to changes in precipitation, but in part to warming, which is resulting in reduced snowpack and soil moisture, and increased evapotranspiration. Efforts to restore Arizona's forests through th inning (e.g., 4FRI) have the potential to increase water availability and partially offset the increased evaporative demands from a warmer climate. Forest thinning may increase soil water input and ground water recharge through reduced evapotranspiration a nd canopy interception -sublimation. Restored forests are expected to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires that can leave sizable portions of the landscape in a more erodible state with reduced water infiltration capacities. Stream restoration ef forts (e.g., Canyon Creek Restoration -Arizona Game and Fish Department) can re -connect streams to adjacent wetlands, increasing the water retained in Arizona's high elevation forests. A reduced volume of snowpack is also an issue with some studies predi cting wester n mountain ranges will have less by 210068. This trend could have dire consequences because many areas depend heavily on snowpack for their year -round water supply. This is not to say there will no longer be any snow during the winter months but that it will melt off earlier in spring and may not be avai lable in summer when relied upon. Many have viewed the problem of melting snowpack as inevitable and unavoidable but there are some possibilities for coping with snow shortages. Some land managers have begun restoring watersheds 67 \"Future Climate: Projected Extremes\", G. Garfin et. al., 126 -147, A repo rt by the Southwest Climate Alliance., Washington, DC: Island Press, 2013. 68 \"Adapting to Climate Change: Envirnomental Law in a Warmer World\", Matthew Zinn, 34 Ecology L.Q. 61, 67 -68 (2007). pg. 112 to store water and reduce the risk of flooding69. Meadows and wetlands act as natural water reservoirs and allow the more gradual release of water during dry summer months. Cloud seeding is another option that some local gov ernments have been attemptin g to increase snowpack. However, its efficacy and unintended side effect s in a changing climate are uncertain. 3. Wildlife habitat The effects of climate change on native animal populations and their habitats are expected to take many forms. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated with \"high confidence\" that \"Under all ... climate change scenarios for the second half of the 21st century: (1) community composition will change as a result of decreases in the abundan ces of some species and increases in others; and (2) the seasonal activity of many species will change differentially, disrupting life cycles and interactions between species. Composition and seasonal change will both alter ecosystem function.\" In addition , \"Many species will be unable to move fast enough during the 21st century to track suitable climates under mid - and high - range rates of climate change70.\" Of course, migration of species is only feasible if suitable habitat is both available and accessible . As the IPCC notes, many species will be unable to migrate due to landscape habitat fragmentation, loss of suitable habitat, lack of mobility, or because they already live at the highest available elevation. Other changes we are likely to see include: changes in the timing of breeding seasons and migrations; disassembly of current ecosystems and biological communities, and formation of new ones; and altered occurrence of wildlife disease pathogens and invasive species. In general, climate change will e xacerbate many existing stressors on ecosystems and hinder many species' ability to adapt. The complexity and uncertainty associated with climate change pose an unprecedented challenge to wildlife management agencies and organizations in planning for and a ddressing impacts to wi ldlife. T he Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies71 (AFWA), recommends using an adaptive management approach to deal with climate impacts. AFWA's recommended adaptive approach involves assessing existing conservation actions for t heir effectiveness under both current and future climates. Further, in the national climate change strategy the USFWS discusses adaptation as planned, science -based management actions that can help to reduce the impacts of climate change on fish, wildlife, and their habitats72. Examples of existing conservation actions include: connecting landscapes and aquatic systems to allow for wildlife movement relocating species to more suitable habitat (assisted migration) reducing pressures fro m non -climate change s tressors Taboada, Terrestrial and inland water systems.

However, land managers must recognize that la ck of staff and financial resources severely limits what agencies can accomplish alone. Hence, collaboration with partners to undertake various aspects of the work is critical and highly recommended. For example, while land management agencies have perhaps the greatest ability to maintain landscape connectivity, restore and protect natural habitats, protect water sources, and monitor natural environments, their efforts are maximized when informed by input from state fish and wildlife management agencies and other stakeholders. Wildlife agencies monitor the status of wildlife populations and their habitats, track t he health and viability of populations, research specific aspects of wildlife interactions and their relationships to habitat, conduct habitat pro tection and restoration projects, hold refuge p opulations of select species, and actively manage wildl ife, thro ugh translocations or predator management, when necessary. Together these agencies work to reduce non - climate change stressors, reduce the sprea d and introduction of non - native or invasive species, enhance recovery of federally listed species, and keep common species common. The collective goal of these actions is to make wildlife populations as resilient as possible to the variety of envi ronmenta l changes they may encounter in the future. 4. Vegetation Productivity The warmer temperatures expected with climate change and the potential for more extreme heat will impact future vegetation productivity. Flowering is one of the more temperature sensitive phenological events for plants , and increasing temperatures are already affecting pollination and flower production. Warmer temperatures during plant reproduction in many cases reduces yield by as much as 8090 percent from normal temperature ranges73. Thi s decrease in productivity could create problems that managers do not have experience dealing with. Though the issue of decreased vegetative productivity is daunting, th ere are strategies already used by la nd managers to mitigate these impacts. These inclu de; reintroduction of native species; lowering stocking levels; introducing ground cover species to reduce runoff and sedimentation; and minimizing pest species. Recognition that vegetation may become less productive than it once was will require major ad justments from land managers. Managers should consider lower stocking levels (livestock, wildlife, timber, and crops) to balance production with potential future climate scenarios. Vegetati on will likely begin flowering and seeding earlier in the year, so managers need to consider this as they adjust their management activities. One of the strategies land managers can implement in the face of climate change is to restore the land back to its natural structure. In the forested area s of Arizona, this would lead to the selective removal of 73 \"Temperature extremes: Effect on plant growth and development\", Hatfield et. al., Weather and Climate Extremes, Volume 10, Part A, December 2015, Pages 4 -10. pg. 114 small trees in \"dog hair thickets\" to create a more spacious, open forest where trees are not overly compet ing with one another for limited resources. In rangelands and desert grassland ecosystems, restoration management may result in the removal of juni per, mesquite and other woody brush species along with reseeding native grass species where appropriate. The Southwest's climate is projected to become w armer and drier , so plant species that may have thrived in certain habitats may no longer do so. For this reason, another strategy that managers can employ is to increase the us e of drought or heat tolerant plant species when reseeding after disturbances. Drought and temperature tolerance is important because it l owers the amount of water plants need to grow and does not limit the plants' productivity in extreme temperature events. Climate change has already \"very likely increased the size and number of wildfires, insect outbreaks, and tree mortality i n the Southwest and will continue to do so\"74. These fires along with extreme weather events and invasive insects are causing massive disturbances across Arizona. In anticipation of an increasingly warmer, drier climate, managers need to improve ecosystem r esiliency and adaptability to disturbances. Increasing tree spacing will mitigate crown fire being transmitted through the over story limiting the fire's negative impact on the landscape. This, in turn, will limit flooding that often occurs after large fir es. Overall, the best strategy going forward will be to manage plant communities for anticipated changes, minimize disturbance, and restore vegetation with coming climate change in mind. 5. Ecological changes (conversion of vegetation types) Accelerating cl imate change is already causing significant shifts in the ranges of plants and animals75. Species , when facing drier and warmer conditions are shi fting their ranges to track more favorable conditions, often poleward and to higher elevations. In the Southwes t, though many species may be able to adapt by doing this, species at higher elevations (including those living in sky islands ) will face significant challenges. Geography often limits movement in these ecosystems because there simply is nowhere to go. In Southwest forests, rates of ecosystem change due to climate impacts are projected to become more dramatic over the course of the 21st century.76. Conversio n of current vegetation ty pes to other kinds further comp licates issues that are present on the landsc ape (i.e. increased fire activity, reduced water availability, and changing wildlife habitat). To avoid the worst negative impacts of climate change , land managers, should: Increase ecosystem resiliency through paying careful attention to the structure, f unction, and composition of each ecosystem so key adjustments (e.g. thinning, burning, removing invasive species, improving stand diversity) can be made when needed77. This level of understanding may allow land managers to notice when ecosystems begin to ch ange, allowing them to act bef ore these changes fully take hold. 74 \"Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(A) OF the CAA\", US. EPA., Dec 2009, 75 \"A Globally Coherent Fingerprint of Climate Change Across Natural Systems\", Camille Parmesan & Gary Yohe, Nature 421 (January 2, 2003) 76 \"Climate change vulnerability assessment of forests in the Southwest, USA\", James Thorne, et al., Climatic Change (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584 -017- \"Resilience and Stability of Systems\", C.S. Holling, 4 Ann. Rev. Ecology & Systematics 1 -23, 1973 pg. 115 Embark on restoration efforts with the key focus on allowing for evolutionary development of ecosystems under climate change. This means adjusting how restoration has currently been applied in Arizona. Instead of attempting to shift ecosystems back to historical structures, composition, and ranges of natural variability , managers need to take climate change into account and create small habitat clusters of better adapted species across the landscape, letting them link up on their own78. This approach allows nature to establish the level of complexity of each site with less human intervention. Increase habitat connectivity so wildlife are more cap able of moving and shifting their permanent and seasonal habitats, to areas more similar in temperature/precipitation to their historical ranges. Landscape connectivity as a climate change adaptation strategy is being pursued in several regions across the nation and we can clearly see the benefits of connecting landscapes for improving ecosystem resiliency . Though assisted migratio n is a controversial approach in conservation, climate change presents challenges to species and ecosystems that have not been encountered before79. The speed of observed changes due to climate change in species habitat and life cycles is forcing changes in conservation biology thinking and practice. Many species cannot shift habitat ranges fast enough to deal with current and future rates of climate change, so lan d managers should begin to experiment with pilot approaches to assist migration to avoid species decline and possible extinction. 6. Carbon sequestration Although carbon sequestration is one of the main tools in climate mitigation efforts, decreased vegetati on productivity, will lessen the amount of carbon being sequestered. The increase in severe fire activity and fire season length will likely send more carbon into the atmosphere. Ecological changes may result in more carbon being sequestered in the short t erm (i.e. conver sion of grasslands to woody brush ). However, this initial boost is likely to decrease over time. A warmer climate is expected to change how vegetation is distributed across Arizona; a major driver of this will be the increased extent and severity of disturbances80. This will in turn lead to lower amount of carbon sequestered by Arizona's forest and woodland ecosystems. Adverse effects are likely to be greatest in \"areas where resource endowments are the poorest and the ability of land managers to respond and adapt is most limited81.\" However, some land managers may benefit from a warmer climate and/or longer growing season, which will also reduce the amount of carbon not sequestered due to potential disturbances. Adjusting to new conditions will depend on experience, funding, and vegetation type. Specific adjustments may include: Planning for and aiding transitions to new conditions and habitats; 78 \"Habitat Re -Creation Strategies for Promoting Adaptati on of Species to Climate Change\", Jenny Hodgson, Conservation Letters, 2011 79 \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Thomas Kuhn, 1962 80 \"National Forests, in Adaption Options for Climate -Sensitive Ecosystems and Resources\", Joyce et al., 2008, US Clim ate Change Science Program, SAP 4.4 81 \"The Ghost Park\", Paul Solotaroff, Men's J, 2010, Glacier National Park in Peril. pg. 116 Creating diversity by introducing new species over a range of environme nts; Enhancing genetic diversity; Using information about past and probable future conditions to inform activities; Managing to connect landscapes; Managing disturbed areas to restore ecological processes rather than pre -disturbance conditions and; Anticip ating rather than reacting to weather -related events. The key to maintaining or improving the current level of carbon sequestration in Arizona is achieving sustainability. Land managers need reduce the risks presented by climate change through sound planni ng, decision -making , and management. These, along with cooperation, will be critical to adapting to the changing climate; adaptation will require ongoing, adaptive learning and management. Climate Change Mitigation Managers and citizens can take several a ctions on the landscape to mitigate climate change. There are steps that can be taken to help ecosystems adapt to a changing climate. In forested ecosystems, management actions that encourage healthy, resilient forests can help avoid the loss of carbon due to unnaturally severe wildfires. Use of mechanical thinning and controlled burning have been shown to reduce fire risk and net carbon released by wildfires82. Thinning and burning treatment can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by as much as 98%83. The ove rall carbon balance of a managed forest is sensitive to the eventual outcome of how the wood pro ducts are utilized, with longer -lived wood products providing the longest carbon storage benefit. Even wood harvested and burned immediately for production of electricity has a carbon benefit if the energy replaced by biomass burning would otherwise come from fossil fuels. Some of the carbon released to the Earth's atmosphere from burning of biomass and fossil fuels can be offset by land management practices tha t encourage carbon sequestration in vegetation and soils . The USDA's Agricultural Research Service estimates that 20 million metric tons of carbon is currently sequestered each year in U.S. farm and grazing land soils. This estimate indicates that U.S. fa rms and ranches are indeed a net carbon sink, sequestering carbon in the soil and keeping it out of the atmosphere. USDA and State Department personnel estimate an additional 180 million metric tons annually could be stored in farm and range land acres. Th is would account for 12% to 14% of the total U.S. emissions of carbon according to the State Department. Transformation of free-floating atmospheric carbon to fixed -state carbon stored in landscapes can be achieved through the following methods: Tree plan tings Soil organic matter (decaying and decayed plant remains which hold carbon) Perennial grass plantings 82 \"The effects of a thinning treatment on carbon stocks in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest .\" Finkral and Evans, Forest Management 255: -2750. 83 \"Carbon protection and fire risk reduction: toward a full accounting of forest carbon offsets \", Hurteau, Mathew D., G. W. Koch, and B.A. Hungate. 2008, Front. Ecol. Environ. 6, DOI : 10.1890/070187. pg. 117 Underground traps, including large bodies of water and organic soil Landowners can receive credits in exchange for planting perennial vegetation on their land, which results in elevated levels of carbon sequestration. These credits are then sold on the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) for cash payments. Carbon credits encompass two ideas: 1. The prevention and/or reduction of carbon emissions produced by human activities is kept from reaching the atmosphere by capturing and diverting them to secure storage. Methane digesters or conservation farming practices are ex amples to reduce to amount of carbon released into th e atmosphere. 2. The removal of carbon from the atmosphere by various means such as agroforestry or perennial grasses and securely storing it in biomass and soil organic matter. Once a carbon credit carrie s a market value and is legally equivalent to documented emissions reductions, two further issues arise; additionality and permanence: Additionality refers to the certainty that some ecological offset results in new carbon fixation, rather than simply subsidizing \"business as usual.\" Demonstrating additionality requires a baseline against which new carbon stores can be measured. Natural regeneration o f abandoned farmland, for instance, could be used to offset continued fossil fuel emissions, undercutting greenhouse gas reduction goals. Scenario for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions in the Electricity Sector Major shifts in how electricity is produced can lead to large reductions in heat -trapping gas emissions. Shown is an illustrative scenario in which different energy combinations could, by 2050, achieve an 80% reduction of heat -trapping gas emissions from 1990 levels in the electricity sector in the Southwest. For each state, that mix varies, with the circle representing the average hourly generation in megawatts (the number above each circle) from 10 potential energy sources. CCS refers to carbon capture and storage. pg. 118 Permanence is an issue because reduced emissions from a power plant or vehicle are permanent. For ecological offsets, permanence is complicated by the dynamic nature of ecosystems. Carbon stores ebb and flow with normal disturbance regimes, sometimes unpredictably i n the case of fire, insect outbreak, or wind throw from severe storms . Other Considerations Urban Areas - Some of America's local governments have been at the forefront of the movement to address climate change. Citizens are demanding action, and continu ed leadership from local governments is essential to solving the issue. More than 40% of emissions come from commercial and residential buildings. Local governments are best suited to improve building codes, foster community -scale renewable energy, and create programs and incentives to increase efficiency. Local governments can promote the deployment of green infrastructure that reduces carbon emissi ons including community forest , green roofs, and parks and open space. Trees and landscaping are tools for re ducing energy consumption . The Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center The Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (SW CASC) was establ ished in 2011 to provide objective scientific information, tools, and techniques that land, water, wildlife, and cultural resource managers and other interested parties can apply to anticipate, monitor, and adapt to climate change impacts in the southweste rn United States. The goals of SW CASC are: -To foster and support the highest quality climate and biological sciences research by connecting the scientific strengths of the USGS with those of the SWCASC partner institutions. -To coordinate and collaborat e with users and other providers of climate information to ensure that the research pursued by scientists results in tools, techniques, models, and actionable information to facilitate robust decision -making by resource managers, policy makers, and other stakeholders. -To build enduring relationships with stakeholders that enable meaningful collaboration, clear communication, and effective translation of scientific results. pg. 119 Key Partners/Stakeholders Many partners and stakeholders can play roles in supporting implementation of this strategy. A few entities are especially important: Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) Arizona Game & Fish Department (A ZGFD) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Forest Service National Park Service (NPS) Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Arizona Universities The Nature Conservancy Resour ces - Existing and Needed Existing Resources Agencies have mandates to incorporate climate change into their plans and activities. Resource Needs Develop assessment tools, guidelines, and benchmarks for determining what constitutes healthy or desirable ec osystems .

Methods to evaluate the impa cts of climate change on ecosystems, and their response. Outreach programs to increase public awareness of climate change and its implications. Conduct monitoring for benchmark establishment and assessment of observed change. pg. 120 Focus Areas An assessment developed by The Nature Conservancy84 was used to determine the Climate Change Focus Areas. Their assessme nt used a categorization approach frequently used in conservation planning85 to group temperature change and conservation importance into four classes of vulnerability. C lasses were delineated above (high) and below (low) the 50th percentile. 84 Robles, M.D. and C.E. Enquist. In Review. Managing changing landscapes in the Southwest United States .

During this time, the lands in Arizona have provided human cultures with a variety of resources including shelter, building materials, wild game, water, seasonal fruits and seeds, ceremonial plants, medicines, minerals and land f or farming and livestock grazing, and source of spiritual significance . Human interaction with, and de pendence upon, the land will continue to be i nfluenced by the values, practices, and understandings of diverse social groups. Whi le there are many shared concepts, values, and practices across social groups, there are also distinct differences requirin g balance , compromise, and cooperation among competing interests. While challenging, the consideration of an array of cultural values in the management of our lands represents a more holistic and profitable approach , improving interaction a nd collaboration amo ng parties. Introduction Anthropologist Edward Tylor defined culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society\"86. Similarly, the Merriam -Web ster Dictionary (2010) defines culture as; a) \"the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations\", and b) \"the customary beliefs, social forms, and m aterial traits of a racial, religious, or social group.\" Restoration and sustainable management of our ecosystems go beyond integrating the best available biophysical science into planning activities. They necessitate an acknowledgment that humans are inextricably conne cted to the natural world and a system of values. Moreover, humans have perceptions associated with the land that vary across the landscape and a diversity of cultural groups. W hen a cult ural group develops a social attachment to a specific location (i.e., a sense of place), they are more likely to have an opinion on and concern for ecological management in that area. \"Landscapes are the symbolic environments created by human acts of conferring meaning to nature and the environment, of giving the environment definition and form from a particular angle of vision and through a special filter of values and beliefs. Every landscape is a symbolic environment. These landscapes reflect out self -definitions that are grounded in culture ... any physica l place has the potential to embody multiple landscapes, each of which is grounded in cultural definitions of those who encounter that place. Every river is more than just a one river. Every rock i s more than just one rock.87\" It is import ant to recognize variability across cultural norms, individual practice, and g roup action . Many groups (e.g., Native American, Hispanic, Asian, African American, and Pacific Islander) should be considered and engaged when developing land management policies and activities. No single analysis can provide a comprehensive review of all variables associated with the formation and expression of cultural attributes. 86 Tylor, 1874. Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom. Vol. 1. 87 Greider, T. and L. Garkovich. 1994. Landscapes: The social construction of nature and the environment. Rural S ociology. 59(1):1, \u00c824. pg. 127 Key Elements Human interaction with Arizona's landscapes will continue t o be influenced by a variety of values, norms, and understandings held by diverse cultural groups. Arizona's demographic constitution is continually changing. While some social traits crosscut cultural groups, land managers must recognize and consider social differences that require a balanced appr oach. Land managers need to develop comprehensive strategies to address the demands of a growing population and changing demographics. Land managing agencies develop and maintain unique relationships with various cultural groups (e.g., Native American tribes, Hispanic communities ), each of which may desire access to managed lands for contemporary and traditional use. Different parties may have dissimilar rights, responsibilities , and r elationships, calling for a nuanced approach to land management. Many of the Southwest's Native American Communities maintain traditional and contemporary ties to areas across Arizona. This document provides: o An opportunity to work collaboratively in developing and implementing a regional approach involving tribes that is incl usive of tribal culture and their traditional and reservation lands. o An opportunity for tribes who consult and interact with othe r natural resource agencies to identify important landscapes and crucial issues. o An opportunity to provide consistency in plann ing information and coordination while involving tribes in the process. Information on cultural resources and surveys is maintained electronically on the AZSITE database, by federal land managing agencies, and at Tribal cultural resources management office s, but they do bot distribute this information. They recommend individual consultation with appropriate groups prior to beginning any ground disturbing activity. The National Park Service Bulletin No. 38 provides guidance for identifying and evaluating traditional cultural properties. This effort should only be conducted in close collaboration with the traditional cultures of the area . Benefits, Threats, and Impacts Integration of cultural values into the management of Arizona's natural resources is key to creating and maintaining healthy ecosystems. Failure to acknowledge and consider traditional cultural values can threaten or harm both relationships and resources. Examples include: Reduction in communication and increase in misunderstanding. Obstacles in meeting management goals, objectives, and proposed activities. Imbalanced access for cultural groups and the greater public. Increased tension between stakeholders. Reduction in agency credibility and collaboration. Improper or unsustainable u se of resources. Missed opportunities for broader and more accurate interpretation. Introduction of legal consequences and civil liability. pg. 128 Demographic Patterns and Trends With Arizona's changing demographics, it is essential that land managers understan d how various communities and social groups interact with the lands under their care. Arizona's 2017 population was estimated t o be more than 7 million. This represents a 9.8 percent increase from 2010. As of 2017, the largest census defined group in Arizo na is Caucasians (54.9 percent ) and the fastest growing group is Hispanic/Latino (31.4 percent ). Native American populations currently comprise about 5.3 percent of Arizona 's total population. Although indigenous populations are increasing, their represent ative proportion is consistently outpaced and shrinking88. The development of management policies and practices to address diverse cultural needs also requires acknowledging other demographic variables, such as age and gender, which intersect with culture. In 2017, individuals under the age of 18 represented 23.3 percent of Arizona's population while those 65 years and older represented 17.1 percent. Arizona is shiftin g to an older population more rapidly than as estimated in the early 2000's. Past and Pre sent Land Use Trends in Arizona Duri ng the Late Pleistocene, beginning roughly 12 ,000 years ago, the Southwest was much cooler and wetter than it is today. Tribes of nomadic hunter -gatherers, known as Paleo -Indians, occupie d the region. Around 9,500 years ago, the environment changed and people adapted by expanding their resource base and changing into a lifestyle archaeologists call the Archaic. Approximately 2,000 years ago, sedentary cultures arose and agricultural crops, such as maize, beans, and squash became increasingly important to the Native American diet . Spanish arrival in the Southwest during the sixteenth century initiated further dramatic change. Led first by Coronado, they explored the region, encountering , trading, and feuding with Native Am erican tribes, such as the Zuni and Hopi. This was followed by two centuries of Spanish rule, which introduced new concepts to the area such as Christianity, taxes, and exotic goods (e.g., horses, metal knives, and livestock). Eventually, Spanish rule of t he Southwest wa s replaced by Mexican rule . To encourage settlement, both the Spanish and Mexican governments provided large land assignments (grants of land) to potential settlers, wh ich contrasted Native Am erican perspectives of a shared use of the landsc ape89. The arrival of Anglo -Americans to the Southwest and Arizona in the late 1800s resulted in a third infusion to the existing Native American and Spanish -American cultural groups. \"Beneath the three major cultural groups existed a diverse subcultural p attern, with each subgroup maintaining a remarkable degree of integrity exemplified by language, religion, art, and occupation .\"90 After the Civil War, railroad routes were constructed extensively across the Southwest. The railroad facilitated the establish ment of industries such as mining, ranching, farming, and timber harvesting91.\" For decades, these sectors provided the foundation for employment upon which the state's predominantly 88 United States Census Bureau , Quick Facts: Arizona, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/az/PST045217 89 Baker, Robert, Maxwell, R., Treat, V., & Det hloff, H. 1998.

Cattle grazed open ranges of the fores ts ... estimated at 172,000 head in 1880, increased to over 1.5 million by 1890\"93. These industries contributed to the development of specif ic values and lifestyles of people living off the land94. \"The legacies of Spanish, Mexican, Indian, mining, and cattle eras are not just romanticism or myth but social and cultural patterns that are very much alive and real. Since World War II, a new dimen sion has been superimposed on the older social and economic patterns. Arizona and New Mexico have developed modern urban centers where high -tech and high -style dwell in strangely comfortable juxtaposition with the pueblo, the herding village, the mining to wn, and the wilderness\"95. It was clear, however, that unregulated use of the Southwest's natural resources was resulting in degraded ecosystems. In 1891, Congress authorized President Harrison , under the Creative Act of 1891, to designate areas of the pub lic domain as forest reserves to preserve timber and protect watersheds, eventually becoming national forests96. The creation of reserves and subsequent national forests did not end the mismanagement of ecosystems. On the contrary, balancing the numerous de mands for publicly owned federal and private lands continues to be an uphill struggle, including issues such as management of wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, and research areas; keeping track of land boundaries; and controlling the use of na tural resou rces, such as forage, timber, mineral, wildlife , water, and soil. Of equal importance and just as challenging for land managers has been the role of private lands and their relationship with public lands. One specific challenge from the past was \"those who owned private lands controlled the use of much of the adjoining public lands by their presence and their actions. For example, in northern Arizona, the exclusive possession of small scattered parcels of land with springs and wells on them effectually prov ided control of large tracts of adjacent dry land\"97. Today, however, studies are showing that extrac tive uses on our publ ic lands are in decline and being replaced by non -consumptive uses, such as recreation, tourism, service related industries, and restor ation98. While this trend is generally common across the state of Arizona, there are still numerous exceptions. For example, uranium mining, while controversial, continues to be important to the economic and social framework of the Kaibab National Forest a nd surrounding communities99. Livestock grazing continues across many of Arizona's ecosystems and ownership boundaries. However, the number of permitted allotments on federal land has been in decline across the state. The Coronado National Forest indicates, \"socially, a critical mass of ranches is needed to support the infrastructure, markets, and human relationships that keep ranch culture and industry alive. The future of this industry may lie in conservation ranching, carbon sequestration and emerging dem ands for grass -fed beef and locally produced food\"100. Finally, it should be recognized that many individuals who worked as natural resource land managers have been Caucasian. As a result, much of the policy, management, and use of our natural resources have been 92 Coconino National Forest, 2008. Economic and Social Sustainability Assessment.

Today, land management agencies have recognized the need to structure their workforce to more effectively address the varied cul tural uses and values of forests . As we move into the future, we mus t continue to create more opportunities for incorporating the values and beliefs of a changing population into the managem ent of our public lands whether as a moral imperative or as directives . Native Americans Arizona is home to 21 federally recognized Native American tribes/nations. Collectively, they own approximately 33,716 square miles of land, which is more than one -fourth of Arizona's land mass102. Native American s are recognized U.S. citizens and entitled to all of the legal ri ghts and protections guaranteed by the Constitution. Additionally, federally recognized tribes are granted legal status by the U.S. Government as sovereign dependent nations. Federal legislation has also provided the tribes with government -to-government relationship status; ri ghts for fishing, hunting, water use, and gaming operations; and protection of religious freedom, cultural resources, and sacred sites. Examples of legislation author izing these rights are; National Environmental Policy Act, National Indian Forest Resource s Management Act, Tribal Forest Protection Act, and Archeological Resources Protection Act. While many of Arizona's tribes sh are similar perspectives on forest -related issues, they also have unique beliefs and values. There are also times when tribal valu es and beliefs can differ from traditional western perspectives . \"Traditional tribal values typically do not make a distinction between what is secular and what is religious. Those values ar e intertwined as a foundation of their culture and beliefs. Traditionalists perceive all actions and events as inter -related and believe that individuals have personal responsibilities to perpetuate all life and the harmony of the universe. Many places and sites on the Forest are considered \"traditional cultural pr operties\" that are formally recognized as physical manifestations of the values and beliefs that give tribal people their identity as a people. These special places are a living cultural landscape that are tes taments to the tribal histories, values, and be liefs that must be sustained if their cultures a re to survive into the future.103\" \"The power of the supernatural is inherent in all of nature including mountains, plants, and animals, all of which are interdependent. Reciprocity regulates the persisting rel ationships between humans and all other beings. Sacred places may be places of prayer, places to collect material for ceremonies, places to gather medicine are places to carry out other privileg ed, sensitive, or confidential activities, which cannot be sho red with the uninitiated. Visual aspects may in themselves be sacred. The responsibility to respect these sacred places is inhe rent in tribal belief systems.104\" \"The concept of sacredness tends to conjure up thoughts of religion in the non -Indian, western m ind. The term \"religion,\" however, does not have the same meaning as in the non -Indian world; it has been adopted and used because it is the closest word we (the non-Indian, western, dominant society) have that Indian people can use when they try to explai n to us their relationship with the land.105\" 101 Johnson, Cassandra and English, D.B.K. 2007.

Cultural Landscapes as a Methodology for Understanding Natural Resource Management Impacts in the Western United States. Journal of Conservation Ecology. 7 (1): 12. http://www.consecol.org/vol7/iss1/art12 pg. 131 Land managers and other stakeholders interested in working with tribes must develop an accurate understanding of and respect for tribal protocols and culture. It is equally important to continuously involve tribe s in \"planning, implementing and monitoring \" activities affecting natural resources they have identified a s a concern106. At a 2004 forum hosted by the Coronado National For est, tribal representatives requested more traditional knowledge be integrated into forest decision and planning processes more often , that greater attention is paid to privacy issues associated with cul tural resources, and that resource issues of m utual concern be addressed through greater collaboration107. Other topics identified by tribes as important forest issues include, but are not limited to: Access to federal lands to gather traditional materials . Impact to special places because of Arizona's growing population . Resto ration and maintenance of native plants used by the various tribes Communication between the tribes and land managers regarding agency jurisdiction, per mitting, and policy. Advance notification about forest management activities, such as thinning and burning. Hispanics The Office of Managem ent and Budget defines Hispanic and Latino individuals \"as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race\"108. Hispanics are the l argest and fastest -growing demographic group in the United States and Arizona109. As a result, new demands are placed on resources and land managers to acknowledge, accommodate , and incorporate a wider range of values and activities110. A recent report by the USFS Pacific Northwest Research Station indicated, \"ethnic minorities have little awareness of the recreation opportunities available to them on public lands. Few understand the differences between the many federal, state, and local areas and managing agencies. Better information is needed to facilitate gr eater participation by these groups. Efforts such as multilingual materials and reaching out through community groups are necessary to deliver the needed information to the minority populations111.\" Research from federal land management agencies in Arizona suggests adoption of the foll owing strategies to help meet the needs of both land managers and the greater Hispanic community : Include f acilities that can accommodate larger family groups.

The Intersection of Cultural Resources and Forest Resources A primary management activity in Arizona that continues to gain momentum is the restoration of overstocked stands of ponderosa pine that are at risk for crown fires. The restoration proces s requires the use of mechanical equipment to harvest small - diameter trees as well the application of prescribed fire to restore key ecosystem processes. An ongoing challenge for forest managers is establishing an understanding of and support for restorati on-based activities a mong various cultural groups. For example, research indicates that many individuals understand and support the use of fire to maintain ecosystem health , yet are still concerned about the smoke generated from prescribed or natural fire s112. Another example involves homeowners who live near forests and object to forest restoration activities113. As restoration treatments grow in frequency and scale, land managers will have to engage a more diverse group of stakeholders . Arizona's growing pop ulation has brought more people into outlying, forest - adjacent areas, where they live in close proximity to longtime residents. Differences in values, perceptions, and lifestyle s can be a source of tension. For example, a study funded by the Prescott Natio nal Forest found that \"Newer residents were perceived not to appreciate issues about water, fire 112 Bowie, James. 2009. City of Flagstaff Citizen Survey. http://www.flagstaff.az.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=9188 113 Id. 110 . City of Flagstaff Open Space Program Picture Canyon Natural and Cultural Preserve is 478 acres of land sheltering nearly 800 petroglyphs, Northern Sinagua habitation sites, and other cul turally significant artifacts. In 2012, the City of Flagstaff obtained Picture Canyon from State Trust land expressly to set it aside as designated open space for educational and recreational purposes. The city of Flagstaff's Open Space Program has worked with local partners to restore the natural and cultural integrity of the Preserve, host volunteer events, education the public about the impo rtance of the ar ea, and provide ou tdoor recreational . Accomplishments include restoring the riparian habitat of the Rio de Flag, refurbish or decommission trails, roads and a bridge, launch a Site Steward program at the Preserve, install interpretive signs, and provide g uided tours . The award recognizes T he City of Flagstaff's Open Space Program received a Government Agency award for providing and supporting volunteer efforts, partnerships and public education programming to preserve the archaeological, historical, and n atural resources at Picture Canyon Natural and Cultural Preserve. pg. 133 susceptibility, and other environmental characteristics. Others were perceived to lack a land ethic that was often taught as part of the experience of growing up in these rural communities.\" Some individuals, groups, and corporations are concern ed about dwindling availability of land for new development. For example, a focus group study conducted by the Prescott National Forest revealed that \"Some citizens in lo cal communities have expressed concerns to the PNF for retaining National Forest lands within or adjacent to their communities to prevent development and retain open space. Verde Valley citizens want to retain the view sheds around their area as unchanged.\" 114 Shifting demographics changes can contribute to social divisions based on personal connections to the landscape. While one person sees the forest as a place of peaceful reflection, another may come from a tradition of hu nting. For example, \"Many newer migrants and visitors place higher importance on aesthetic values and recreation while potentially lacking the historical and cultural connection to a working landscape characteristic of f armers, ranchers, and loggers\". A nd \" ... there exists a deep historical conflict among competing values that has resulted in an 'us against them' orientation where farmers, ranchers, loggers and miners view themselves as under siege from the new urban driven environmentalists.115\" Focus Area s and Priority Landscapes Land managers need to develop comprehensive strategies to address the demands of growing population, demographic changes , and socially defined competition for access to forest and other ecosystems . This includes the recognition a nd acknowledgment of various forest users and uses, values and perceptions , socio -economic interactions, as well as developing increased coll aboration among various stakeholders . \"We must continue to understand what people care about and why, as well as ho w forests are viewed, valued, and being used by a changing public...forests and parks should be managed for all Americans to learn about, appreciate, and enjoy the natural environment and cultural resources. It is essential to remain relevant to current an d future generations and encourage everyone to appreciate and support these wild places\". Cultural Resources Issue Assessment A primary management activity in Arizona that continues to be problematic is the challenge of balancing ecosystem health goals an d objectives with the protection of archaeological resources. Fairley explains, \"Archaeological resources are a particularly vulnerable part of the story because they are embedded in the very land that is threatened by wildfires and expanding residential a nd commercial uses116 \". Not only do these resources help us understand past cultural uses and perspectives of the landscape, but they also 114 Prescott National Forest, 2008. Economic and Social Sustainability Assessment.

Island Press. pg. 134 serve as important physical and spiritual landmarks for many Native American tribes and other cultural groups. Cultur al resources can be defined as physical evidence or place of past human activity: site, object, landscape, structure; or a site, structure, landscape, object or natural feature of significance to a group of people traditionally associated with it. Types of cultu ral resources in Arizona include : Arch aeological resources: The remains of past human activity and records documenting the scientific analysis of these remains. Historic structures: Material assembl ages that extend the limits of human capability. Cultural landscapes: Settings we have created in the natural world. Ethnographic resources: Sites, structures, landscapes, objects or natural features of significance to a traditionally associated group of people. Background Cultural resource management (CRM) can trace its beginning to the environment/conservation movement in the 1960s and 1970s.117 In 1966, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) was passed so cultural resources would be protected from damage caused by the actions of federal agencies. Because of the NHPA, the State of Arizona established the State Historic Preservation Act (SHPA) in 1982 to protect cultural resources from the activities of state agencies. During this time, the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating \"growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.\"118 Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the Antiquities Act, but it was not until the 1970s when the Nationa l Park Service coined the term \"cultural resources\" . This term came in to more popular usage in 1974 after the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.119 Following these conferences, the National Park Service defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being: \"Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture...[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.\"120 Vegetation Treatments and Prescribed Fire Best Practices for Cultural Resour ces Management 117 Hutchings, Rich and Marina La Salle. 2012.

Doing Archaeology: A Cultural Resource Managemen t Perspective. Left Coast Press, https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8sw0798v pg. 135 Fire-sensitive Sites A review of available literature on the effe cts on fire on cultural resources indicates that there are two categories of fire -sensitive sites. T he first consists of sites known to be vulnerable to the effects of even low-temperature fires and/or light fuel loads, such as sites that contain organic materials, exposed wooden architecture, etc. The second group in cludes sites that have been considered less risk for fire effects in most situations, including prehistoric and historic sites with deeply buried cultural deposits; prehistoric and historic a rtifact scatters; and prehistoric and historic sites with non -flammable surface features. However, depending on field condition s, especially fuel loading, as well as specific site characteristics and expected fire behavior, these other site types may be fire -sensitive in certain fuels reduction projects. Known Fire -Sensitive Site Types in Arizona: Historic sites with standing, or down wooden structures or other flammable features or artifacts. Rock art sites (depending on rock type, exposure, fuel type, and fuel loading) Cliff dwellings Prehistoric sites with flammable architectural elements and other flammable features or artifacts Prehistoric sites with exposed building stone of soft or porous material such as volcanic tuff Culturally modified trees, including aspen art and peeled/scarred trees Certain traditional cultural properties (based on consultation with tribes) Other Project -Specific Fire -Sensitive Sites: Other sites, based on local field conditions a nd Forest -specific concerns Sites based on consultation with Tribal representatives Sites based on consultation with SHPO staff Sites based on consultation with fire management staff, fire behavior specialists or fire effects researchers Agency cultural resource specialists will use site assessment and monitoring data, and will consult with fire management staff, to identify known and other project -specific fire -sensitive sites for individual project areas. Fire -sensitive sites officially determined not e ligible for the National Register of Historic Cultural Resource PA The Arizona Association of Conservation Districts (AACD) and the BLM are facilit ating a working group to create a Cultural Resource Programmatic Agreement to identify common sense programmatic approaches that will ensure timely and cost -effective implementation of critical conservation work, while preserving Arizona's rich history and traditions, and our important cultural resources. This AACD effort, with the support of Arizona's State Historic Preservation Officer, and funding support from the BLM, will bring together key agricultural producers, state and field level agency staff, NE PA specialists, tribal representatives, and archeologists to help identify issues and solutions. pg. 136 Places do not require protection under Section 106. There may be other reasons for protecting the site; those are not explored in this document. Standard Protection Measures Various combinations of the followi ng protection measures may be employed by agency personnel to protect sites within fuels reduction projects. Agency personnel should also consult with SHPO to ensure that projects comply with State laws such as the Arizona State Historic Preservation Act . Prescribed b urning Protect fire -sensitive sites: Exclude from project area Hand line Black line Wet line Foam retardant Structural fire shelter Remove heavy fuels from site by hand thinning Prevent in -situ heavy fuels that cannot be removed from ignition (e.g., flush -cut & bury stumps) Implement same protective measures for future maintenance burns Remove vegetation and tree limbs near petroglyph or pictograph sites Protect selected other sites (option) Allow burning over sites without fire sensitive fea tures or materials: No slash piles within site boundaries No ignition points within site boundaries No staging of equipment within site boundaries Allow construction of safety zones and additional lines in 100% of surveyed areas, with archaeological monito ring to ensure recorded sites are avoided. Thinning No thinni ng within site boundaries -or- allow thinning within site boundaries, provided: Cutting is accomplished using hand tools only Large diameter trees are felled away from all features Thinned materi al is hand carried outside site boundary No use of mechanized equipment within site boundaries No staging of equipment within site boundaries Fuelwood s ales No fuelwood cutting or vehicles within site boundaries -or- Allow fuelwood cutting within sites, bu t do not allow vehicles within site boundaries Allow fuelwood cutting in areas of continuous, low -density scatters, with post -project monitoring Post-treatment Protection Measures pg. 137 In some cases, cultu ral resources may be impacted indirect ly because of ve getation treatments and prescribed fire. Examples may include increased sheet erosion, which may displace artifacts or damage site features. Vegetation treatments may also increase the chances of cultural resources sustaining human impacts due to exposure of artifacts and site features. Cultural resources are particularly vulnerable to erosion during the first monsoon event after treatment. Various combinations of the following protection measures may be employed to minimize indirect effects. Agency cultural specialist may conduct post -treatment site visits to assess potential of indirect effect s. Agency cultural specialist may consider protecting sites from sheet erosion by: Cross -falling trees upslope from a cultural resource Application of mulch and re -seeding with native grasses and forbs Installation of geo -textile cloth along arroyo and drainage edges (e.g. , when a site is situated along the edge of an arroyo, the geotextile cloth can prevent the wall of the drainage being blown out during the first monsoonal event, which usually contains the greatest hydraulic forces). Agency cultural sp ecialist may consider protecting sites from human -sustained impacts by: Restricting access by installing physical barriers (natural existing materials are best, such as strategically placed boulders) Temporary closure of roads and trails until the treatmen t area is reclaimed by natural vegetation (which reduces exposure) Signage Periodic monitoring Periodic law enforcement patrol Benefits, Threats, and Impacts Benefits Historic and archaeological properties are tangible reminders of the people and events t hat molded our state. Archaeological sites hold the clues to 12,000 years of culture, land use, settlement, and exploration. Historic buildings provide character and a sense of continuity for our communities. Arizona's unique historic and archeological res ources attract tourists from all over the world. Threats Expanding population. Road building. Recreation. Vandalism and artifact looting. Natural Resource Management (fence building, fuels treatments, logging) Any ground disturbing activities. Impacts pg. 138 Loss of prehistoric and/or historic properties. Destruction of archeological/sacred sites. Gentrification of culturally significant areas. Loss of individual connection to past ancestors. Resources -Existing and Needed Existing Resources Tribal governments have staff that can help define and address this issue. Federal and State land management agencies have existing staff dedicated to the management of cultural resources. Arizona State Histor ic Preservation Office (SHPO) Governor's Office on Tribal Relation s Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Chicanos Por La Causa Resource Needs Data from multiple entities about management needs and strategies to address and preserve those culturally significant values associated with forested landscapes across the state. Better information and education from multiple entities about the various cultural values and their relationships with forest and other land management activities. Key Partners & Stakeholders Many of the partners and stakeholders listed below have a potential r ole in supporting implementation of this strategy. A few entities stand out as being critical to success: Tribal governments within Arizona Key state agencies (e.g ., State Historic Preservation Offi ce, Governor's Office on Tribal Relations ) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Priority Areas Criteria used to define priority areas, or identify additional priority areas, include: Areas within Tribal boundaries (reservations). Currently known and to be discovered cultural sites (includes State Historic Preservation Office and State Museum process). Landscapes where various cultural groups indicate a specific attachment or desire to be consulted on management issues and actions Areas defined by the mapping of Terrestrial Ecoregions Level Ill -Arizona, whe re scientific information indicates high priority ecosystems pg. 139 pg. 140 Goals, Objectives, and Actions The Strategy Team identified two (2) goals, five (5) objectives, and thirteen (13) action items for Culture. The goals were designed to: Improve communication b etween all land management agencies, tribes, and other cultural groups Develop effective collaborative mechanisms for sharing resources, priorities, policies, and management strategies. The objectives are designed to: Build trust, communication networks, a nd pr oblem -solving strategies among land management agencies and cultural groups Improve and develop a broader understanding of various cultures' perspectives as they relate to natural resource issues and land management decisions Educate people involved in land management activities about the role and importance of cultural perspectives in the planning and decision -making process Where appropriate, share data and implementation strategies to leverage successful outcomes Improve information sharing about a vailable resources to address the needs of Native American tribes /nations and other cultural groups in Arizona. pg. 141 Goal 1: Improved communication between all land management agencies, indigenous tribes, and other cultural groups about varying perspectives and beliefs related to forests, trees, and other natural resources. Objective 1: Build trust, communication networks, and problem -solving strategies between land management agencies, communities, and stakeholders about the diverse cultural perspectives of forest users and Indigenous Tribes, Develop adequate tribal liaison staffing within the state and federal natural resource agencies to facilitate the ability to address the cultural perspectives associated with the management and protection o f forest resources. Facilitate the development of appropriately structured work groups to share information and develop strategies to identify, protect and address cultural issues associated with forested lands and their management. Develop a monitoring sy stem to ascertain the effectiveness of strategies developed above. Utilize adaptive management to ensure forest management policy and planning integrates the needs of the state's changing demographics. Objective 2: Improve broader understanding of various cultural perspectives as they relate to forest resources, fire management, and other natural resource issues. Encourage and facilitate improved information sharing by indigenous tribes and diverse cultural groups to inform others about varying natural resource perspectives. Expand research on how various cultural groups perceive and interact with the state's forests, trees, and other natural resources , including the urban forest environment . Objective 3: Educate the public, government officials, and co mmunity leaders about the role and importance of cultural perspectives in restoration, sustainable forest and wood products businesses, fire management, and community protection needs and responsibilities. Develop and implement an education program for lo cal, state and federal government decision makers, schools, and others about the importance of culture in the forested environment , including the urban forest environment . Identify appropriate human and fiscal resources to effectively accomplish public out reach. Goal 2: Effective collaboration mechanisms for sharing of information about resources, priorities, policies, and management strategies between Tribes and non -Tribal organizations. Objective 1: Where appropriate, share data and implementation strate gies to leverage successful outcomes on tribal and adjacent lands with similar management objectives. Enhance collaborative approaches to collection and sharing of data, utilizing existing planning models, leveraging funding sources, and sharing implementation opportunities. Recognize or encourage BIA and Tribal management plans and implementation strategies that take an all -lands or collaborative approach. Promote development of management plans that are sensitive to culturally significant areas, traditional uses and accessibility to diverse groups (public lands, lands with conservation easements, etc.) Recognize and communicate tribal implementation of NEPA processes when undertaking forestland management and integrated resource planning. Objective 2: Improve information sharing about available resources to address needs of indigenous tribes and other Cultural groups in Arizona. Coordinate collaborative outreach efforts to share information about federal and state resources and programs av ailable to tribes and varying cultural groups. Evaluate the need for non -traditional materials and other strategies to improve communication and message delivery. pg. 142 7.0 Arizona Priority Areas Specific resource i ssues for Arizona were identified and explored in section 6 above. Several crosscutting statewide themes were identified and eight issue maps were developed to id entify focus areas for the eight specific topics. These focus area maps are a starting point. They will be used to help communicate possible implications of issues and actions, as an aid in developing needed strategies, and as a tool to identify synergistic opportuniti es to leverage resources. These maps were revised for this update and will continue to be updated over time as better i nformation is gathered and evaluated. pg. 143 8.0 Collaboration Across Landscapes For deca des, land managers in Arizona have worked in collaboration to reduce impacts to natural resources and improve conditions across the state. When the 2008 Farm Bill asked the states to assess forest conditions and develop strategies to address impacts and threats , we found it was only natural to make it a collaborative effort. With the expansion of the sco pe of this update to all lands, we broaden this collaborative effort to include even more entities . This comes at an ideal time since other agencies, federal and state, are embarking on similar collaborative efforts. Take for example t he 2014 Farm Bill ; it gave the Forest Serv ice tools to get more work done on the ground (e.g. the Good Neighbor Autho rity or GNA ). As of June 2018, the Forest Service has signed 163 GNA agreements on 59 n ational forests in 25 States to complete a variety of restoration activ ities. The 2018 omnibus bill further expanded the GNA and other authoriti es, enabling more work across boundaries. The National Resource Conservation S ervice (NRCS) also has a program to foster collaboration across ownership boundaries called the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). The RCPP brings together a wide array of local and nat ional partners, including Native American tribes /nations , nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, private industry, conservation districts, water districts, universities and many others to complete conservatio n activities in selected priority areas. The RCPP is a platform for partners to engage with organizations that, while they may share common resource stewardship goals, may not have e xperience w orking with farmers, ranchers, and landowners in a given community. So far, more than 2,000 partners are engaged in locally led conservation efforts through the RCPP. The Arizona Conservat ion Partnership (ACP) is comprised of 12 sta te and federal agencies collaborating over a multitude of issues. ACP provides a framework for accomplishing landscape scale conservation work using a collaborative approach that will maintain, restore and enhance Arizona's economic and environmental quality of life. The partnership will provide leadership, and encourage collaboration, information sharing and coordinated action for the benefit of Arizona's citizens and visitors. The group's main goal is to help local organizations get funding for projects by bringing them into contact with different agencies . A steady increase in collaboration capac ity and recent breakthroughs in science, mapping, and tec hnology are providing new tools for planning investments to reduce threats and improve conditions. T hese new authorities and advances in technology will be implemented by: Working to set priorities and co -manage risk across broad landscapes. The most effective approach to management is shared stewardship of the environment, shared ownership of the chall enges presented, and a shared commitment to meeting those challenges. As the scale of natural resource issues grows the scale of coordinated planning needs to expand accordingly. We envision each agency taking a leading role in co nvening stakeholders to di scuss issues affecting the environment. The FAP can provide guidelines for coordinating activities across jurisdictional boundaries. Using new tools to conduct targeted investment planning. Advances in remote se nsing, information science, simulation tools, and mapping technolo gies have enabled scientists to complete new national resource assessments. Based on the assessments, researchers have developed tools for evaluating risk and making land management investments at scales where pg. 144 the payoffs are highest. These tools for scenario investment planning give stakeholders the science -based capacity to find opportunities f or lasting improvements in land conditions by making the corresponding targeted investments. Focusing our work on broad outcomes. Outputs are v aluable indicators of program accomplishments, but outputs alone do not tell us whether we have achieved large -scale outcomes. We envision joining partners and stakeholders to identify desired outcomes and the key performance indicators for measuring them. Capitalizing on the authorities created by recent legislatio n. The 2018 omnibus bill gave DFFM new authorities to help expedite work, including new categorical exclusions, expanded GNA, and 20-year stewardship contracting. We will use every authority we have to get more work done on the ground. Using all available tools for active management. We will use every authority and tool we have to do more work on the ground, including timber sales, mechanical fuel reduction treatments, and carefully managed fire, working with partners and stakeholders to choose the right tools. All this collaboration is part of a conceptual framework f or making strategic investments across landscapes for outcomes desired by a ll. Through sha red work, state and federal agencies along with local organizations have unprecedented opportunities to co -manage risk and a chieve positive outcomes at the most appropriate scales. The key is wo rking together to convene stakeholders for pla nning at landsca pe scales. The partners can use scenario in vestment planning as a tool for assessing risk, evaluating the tradeoffs, and m anaging risk through targeted investments in areas with the highest pay offs. We envision outcomes that include resilient landscapes, flourishing communities, and fewer wasted resources . Success will depend on taking a co-learning and co -designing appr oach together with partners and stakeholders. As envisioned in this document, we hope to help partners interconnect all conservation inter ests in to a network for sustaining Arizona's natural resources into the fut ure. We believe every agency has a role to play in helping partners and stakehold ers come together to co -manage risk, use new tools to better target investments, focus on outcomes a t the right scale, an d recalibrate our land management system so it works better for people, both now and for generations to come. pg. 145 9.0 National Priorities The diversity of Arizona forests range from riparian gallery forest in the low elevation deserts to sub -alpine and montane forests above 9000 feet in elevation. This diversity of Arizona 's landscape presents many natural resource management challenges. The fact that Arizona's forestlands cover approximately 27% of the State and are mostly managed by Fede ral, Tribal, and State entities presents the additional challenge for Arizona's Department of Forestry and Fire Management to deal with threats from insects and disease, urbanization, invasive species , and wildfire. It is ext remel y important that we work together to conserve, enhance and pr otect our forests and the FAP provide s a foundation for this not only on forestlands bu t on all lands within Arizona. To further this effort t he US Forest Service and State Foresters developed three (3) national priorities and 11 o bjectives . This section highlights the priorities and objectives and examines how Arizona is integrating them i nto the FAP. National Priorities and Objectives: 1. Conserve Working Forest Landscapes 1.1 Identify and conserve high priority forest ecosystems and landscapes. 1.2 Actively and sustainably, manage forests. 2. Protect Forests from Harm 2.1 Restore fireadapted lands and reduce risk of wildfire impacts. 2.2 Identify, manage, and reduce threats to forest and ecosystem health. 3. Enhance Public Benefits from Trees and Forests 3.1 Protect and enhance water quality and quantity. 3.2 Improve air quality and conserve energy. 3.3 Assist co mmunities in planning for and reducing forest health risks. 3.4 Maintain and enhance the economic benefits and values of trees and forests. 3.5 Protect, conserve, and enhance wildlife and fish habitat. 3.6 Connect people to trees and forests, and engage them in environmental stewardship activities. 3.7 Manage trees and forests to mitigate and adapt to global climate change. Conserve Conserving working forests and sustainable ecosystems . Fire, insects, disease and invasive plants all act as impo rtant disturbance agents in Arizona ecosystems. Fire suppression has altered the occurrence, severity and intensity of fire. This may have contributed to increased insect and disease activity in certain forest types. No xious weeds and invasive plants are spreading at an ala rming rate, displacing native species and disrupting the normal function of ecosystems. National Objectives Measures Identify and conserve high priority forest ecosystems and landscapes # of stewardship (and practice) plans developed # of acres surveyed , treated, monitored # of prioritization maps developed Actively and sustainably, manage forests # of GNA agreements entered into # of grants awarded to partners # of technical assists to landowners pg. 146 Protect Reducing threats to Arizona 's forestlands from wildfires, in vasive species and forest pests. In addition to lives and property, Arizona wild fires threaten the forests and consequently the many benefits they provide. Proper land management can drastically decrease the risk of loss in the event of a wildfire. While prescribed fire is one example of a mana gement tool , many people do not realize the benefits of fire . Additionally, with the increasing number of people moving to the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) risks for catastrophic wildfire damage al so increase. Research tells us that most of these people are unaware of their increased wildfire risks. Continued work to educate the public (which includes property owners, land managers, city planners, etc.) on wildfire risk mitigation an d defensible spa ce practices is needed. Enhance Improving the hea lth and productivity of Arizona's natural resources. Forests provide sustainable supplies of clean water to the majority of our citizens. Maintaining healthy forest watersheds and riparian forests in rural areas and protecting forest cover in developing areas are essential to ensuring safe and available wate r. Climate variability, increased drought frequency and changes in precipitation patterns demand increased awareness and management of our natural resources to - protect drinking water sources, sustain stream flows, protect aquatic wildlife species and re duce sedimentation and water treatment costs.

The FAP constitutes a road map for diverse stakeholders to collaboratively address issues and opportunities across Arizona. In the process to complete the FAP, strong and productive relationships have been forged. These working relationships constitute the foundation upon which the successful implementation of the FAP will occur. 10.2 Future Actions A diverse collaborative body representing the jurisdiction s, users, and interested parties in the landscapes across Arizona assisted in the developed the FAP. Given the impressive outcomes of this collaborative effort, the State Forester is committed to sust aining and building upon this effort going forward . A ke y goal will be to expand the collaborative engagement of all interested and affected entities, but especially agencies (including U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Arizona State agencies, and all Tribal agencies) and organizations having jurisdictional and management responsibilities of natural resources within the state. Plans are being formulated for the group s to continue meeting periodically to shepherd the implementation, monitoring, r eporting, and adaptation of the FAP. The group s will be charged to solicit specific actions of all partners and stakeholders, to incorporate new information, and to complete the goals, objectives, and actions. While the legislative mandate in the 2008 Fa rm Bill is a formal revision at five -year intervals or as required by the Se cretary of Agriculture, we consider these to be dy namic and living documents where implementation will be monitored, assessed, reported, and adapted on a continuing basis. As indic ated by the results of monitoring and assessment, the FAP will continue to be revised to address evolving issues and opportunities. pg. 149 Appendix A -1: Glossary Additionality Refers to the certainty that a carbon offset results in new carbon fixation, rather than simply subsidizing \"business as usual\" .

Since the origi nal AON, DFFM has become a separate entity from the Arizona State Land Department. Input for the 2005 AON was done in conjunction with the Arizona State Land Department, Arizona Forest Stewardship Committee, and U.S. Forest Service, Region 3 National Forest System . This report is submitted to the U.S. Forest Service as a review and amendment to Arizona's Forest Legacy Assessment of Need . Among the am endments to the 2005 AON are : 1. Updating of project eligibility to remain consistent with the 2017 Forest Legacy Program Implementation Guidelines. 2. Revising of the Maps to better identify Forest Legacy Areas 3. Acknowledgement of changes in species listing on Federal Threatened and Endangered species lists 4. Update on wood fiber processing capacity in Arizona, across the identified Forest Legacy Areas 5. Updates to the listing of Land Trust organizations in Arizona 6. Removal of Appendix E. List of all of the U.S. Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service's listed endangered (E), threatened (T), candidate (C) or of special concern (SC) species, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) sensitive species (S), the United States Forest Service's (USFS) sensitive species (S), as well as Arizona Game and Fish Department's Wildlife of Special Concern in Arizona (WSC) species t hat exist within private forest land by county. 7. Removal of Appendix I. Economic data, forest descriptions and demographics by County Besides document formatting and required updates , no significant changes have been made to the AON. 2 Arizona's Forest Resources The diversity of Arizona's forests range from semi -arid riparian gallery forests to sub -alpine and montane forests, spanning roughly 27% of the state and covering an area of 19.4 million acres. These forests are comprised of conifers and hardwo ods with approximately 35 tree species and range in elevation from approximately 300 to 3,700 meters . The majority of forest land is located above the Mogollon Rim with discrete patches in southeastern Arizona's mountain islands. Pinyon -juniper and pure ju niper woodlands are the most abundant forest type in Arizona, occupying approximately 14.8 million acres or 20.3% of the state. The rarest and most significant in ecological terms is riparian forest, which occupies less than one- half a percent of Arizona's land. While timber production has historically been and the primary function and most consumptive use of Arizona's forests, forest land serves other anthropogenic purposes such as recreation, tourism, mining, and grazing. More importantly, forest lands co ntribute to the overall functioning of ecosystems by playing a vital role in cycling water and nutrients, filtering pollutants, discharging oxygen, and providing habitat for humans and biological diversity, alike. Trends in Forest Land Conversion Explosi ve population and economic growth over the last 35 years have resulted in major changes for Arizona. From 1970 to 2000 Arizona's population grew by 3.37 million a 188% increase. Growth has increased even more dramatically in the last four years with the cu rrent population estimated at 5.44 million, making Arizona the second fastest growing state in the United States. Some impacts of this rapid population growth include ranch and forest land conversion to low -density development, increase demands on forest resources, fragmentation by roads and fences, and interruption or degradation of ecological services. In economic terms, net income from farming and ranching dropped from $565 million in 1970 to $377 million in 2000, while the services and professional ind ustry which includes construction, real estate and trade,increased 48% during the same time period. Arizona's Forest Legacy Program The primary goals for the Arizona Forest Legacy Program are: (1) protect important private forest from conversion to non -forest such as development and ex -urban growth; (2) maintain the ecological integrity of Arizona's forests with the purpose of protecting watershed functions, such as ground water recharge, as well as protect native plant and wildlife habitat; and (3) mainta in forest integrity in order to protect cultural, public and economic values associated with traditional forest uses such as timber harvest, livestock ranching, and recreational opportunities. To reach these goals several program objectives have been ident ified: 3 o Reduce forest fragmentation through protection of ecologically and publicly important private forest land by focusing on large forested blocks. o Maintain watershed functions and protect water supply by protecting forests in the upper watershed and streams. o Protect wide ranging, rare, threatened, and/or endangered plant and wildlife habitat. o Protect important historical and cultural sites. o Promote forest stewardship through partnerships. Arizona's Forest Legacy Areas Private forest land identified i n the Assessment of Need for inclusion in a Forest Legacy Area under the Forest Legacy Program must meet the following minimum criteria: o Environmentally important forest areas, which include areas important for scenic, recreational, riparian, ecological, cultural, or traditional forest uses, and o Threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. For the purposes of the Arizona Forest Legacy Program, forest land is defined as: o Lands stocked with at least 10% tree cover of any size ( at maturity, the trees must be greater than 8 feet in height). Ten percent stocked, when viewed from a vertical direction, equates to an aerial canopy cover of leaves and branches of 25% or greater. o The minimum area for classification is 1 acre, owned by an individual or by an organiz ed group of individuals. In accordance with the Forest Legacy Program Guidelines, the definitions of 'threats of conversion' and 'important forests' are further clarified. To this end, threatened forests are defined as any forest at risk of conversion to non-forest uses by roads and/or human developments. Important forests are defined as those forests that include one or more of the following values: o Riparian Areas o Scenic resources o Fish and wildlife habitat and corridors o Public recreation opportunities o Known threatened and endangered species o Known cultural resources o Timber, and other forest commodities o Other ecological values Using the above definitions of forest, threatened forests, and important forests, it was deter mined that all non -industrial private forest within Arizona are threatened and important and therefore eligible for 4 inclusion in the Forest Legacy Program . County boundaries were selected to delineate the Forest Legacy Areas, resulting in 15 Forest Legacy Are as for Arizona. Prioritization Process Four criteria were selected for use in the prioritization process for evaluating competing Forest Legacy Program projects. The criteria listed in priority order are: 1) The significance of ecological, public, and/or eco nomic values on the property 2) The viability and importance of the site to other forest lands 3) Immediacy of threats to the site 4) Local support and presence of partners and/or matching funding To aid the prioritization process for identifying environmentally important forests at risk of non -forest conversion, three spatially explicit data sets were created to identify areas of high public and ecological value as well as areas of road and development t hreats within private forest lands. The public value spatial layer evaluates private forest lands in the context of values that the general public may place on public lands and cultural resources. The two key components of public value are (1) presence of or proximity to areas with cultural and historical resources, and (2) proximity to public recreation opportunities. The ecological value spatial information was created to assess private forest land in the context of threatened, endangered, and common spec ies locations and habitat requirements, as well as to evaluate their importance to ecological functioning of an area and overall biodiversity of the region. Finally, the development threat spatial layer represents the degree to which an area has been impac ted by human development as well as identifies the boundaries of that impact. This spatial layer was a combination of road impacts and current housing density. Field verification of these spatial layers was conducted for two weeks in April 2004, and was t argeted to areas where public value , ecological value , and development threat intersected. During field reconnaissance approximately 2,400 miles, 25 conservation areas, 6 National Forests, and 18 riparian areas were visited along with representatives from each of the four forest types and development threats. Based upon the spatial analyses and field assessment, recommendations for private forest land priorities are as follows: o Areas classified as having rural housing density or only road impact near Presc ott, Flagstaff, Heber to Show Low along highway 260, Sonoita, Elgin, Green Valley, and Kingman should be prioritized for Forest Legacy Program funds due to their imminent conversion by development. o Riparian forest along perennial water represents a small proportion of the total forest in Arizona, yet a disproportionately high number of species depend on them. Riparian forests are some of the most biologically diverse and rich communities in Arizona. Given their dwindling extent and high value, these areas should be a top priority. 5 Figure 1. Map of Forest Legacy Areas 6 Section 1 I. Forest Legacy Program in Arizona In 2003, Arizona expressed interest in participating in the U.S. Forest Service Forest Legacy Program. The Forest Lega cy Program was authorized under Section 1217 of Title XII of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (P.L. 101 -624:104 stat.3359; 16 U.S.C. 2103c), also referred to as the 1990 Farm Bill amended the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act (CF AA) of 1978, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 2101 et. seq.). The CFAA provides authority for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to provide financial, technical, educational, and related assistance to states, communities, and private forest landowners. Th e 1990 Farm Bill further directs the Secretary to establish the Forest Legacy Program (FLP) to protect environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. In 2003, Congress appropriated $68.3 million towards 42 Fore st Legacy projects, bringing the total number of projects funded by the FLP to 179. The purpose of the FLP is to identify and protect environmentally important forest areas that are threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. The FLP seeks to promote fore st land protection and other conservation opportunities on non -industrial privately -owned forests. Additional benefits include the protection of important scenic, cultural, and recreational resources; preservation of traditional forest uses such as timber management, grazing, and hunting; and conservation of riparian areas, wildlife habitat, and other precious ecological values. Appropriated funds are used to administer the program and support conservation easements on both purchased and donated lands and i nterests in lands meeting the purposes of the FLP program. The FLP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of willing sellers and willing buyers. In order to partic ipate in the FLP, DFFM submits this AON documenting the need for a FLP in Arizo na, establishing eligibility criteria, setting selection guidelines, and identifying priority areas. Areas identified for consideration under the FLP meet the minimum criteria based upon the FLP purpose and guidelines (USDA 2003a). The minimum criteria for establishing Forest Legacy Areas are as follows: o Environmentally important forest areas, which include areas important for scenic, recreational, riparian, ecological, cultural, or traditional forest uses, and are o Threatened by conversion to non -forest us es. Only non -industrial private forest is considered for participation in the FLP administered by the DFFM . Non -industrial private forest (NIPF) is defined as: o Lands with existing tree cover and other lands including crop land, pasture land, surface -mine d lands, and non -stocked forest lands that are scheduled for conversion to tree cover. Further clarifications for NIPF as defined by Arizona's Forest Stewardship Committee (AFSC) include: o \"...lands with existing tree cover...\" are defined as lands stocked with at least 10% tree cover of any size (At maturity, the trees must be \"tree form\" which is defined as greater than eight (8) feet 7 in height). o Ten percent stocked, when viewed from a v ertical direction, equates to an aerial canopy cover of leaves and branches of 25% or greater (NRI 1997). o The minimum area for classification as NIPF is 1 acre, owned by an individual or by an organized group of individuals. Strips of trees must have a cro wn width of at least 120 feet except for windbreaks, which must have a crown width of at least 60 feet at maturity. There is no minimum width requirement for riparian forest land. o Unimproved roads and trails, streams, and clearings in forest areas are classified as NIPF if less than 120 feet wide. o \"...other lands including crop land, pasture land, surface -mined lands, and non -stocked forest lands that are scheduled for conversion to tree cover\" are eligible only if the trees that are naturally regenerat ed or planted are capable of survival without supplemental irrigation once they are established. Established is defined as three years after they are planted. In order to assure program -wide success, each p roject budget will include a minimum nonfederal contribution of 25%. The nonfederal cost -share may consist of: (1) the value of land, or interest in land, dedicated to the FLP that is not paid for by the Federal government; (2) nonfederal costs associated with program implementation; and (3) other nonfede ral costs associated with a grant or other agreement that meets FLP purpose (USDA 2003a). II. Arizona's Forests and Woodlands A. Historical Perspective Pre-European Settlement Climate In order to place forests of today in context, a brief discussion of th e history regarding Arizona's forests is presented. A paleoecological study in the Potato Lake area (approximately 2220 m in elevation) of the southern Colorado Plateau suggested that dramatic changes have occurred in the area's biota over the last 35,000 years (Anderson 1993, Anderson et al. 2000). From 35,000 to 21,000 years before present (B.P.) it appeared that the area was dominated by mixed conifer species suggesting the climate was cooler and wetter than it is today. Between 21,000 to 10,400 B.P., li kely the coldest Engelmann spruce ( Picea engelmannii) formed almost pure stands, growing as low as 2,500 meters. Today, spruce is generally located above 3300 meters. The transition into the Pleistocene - Holocene and end of the glaciation period resulted in a major reorganization of southern Colorado Plateau vegetation. On Utah's Markagunt Plateau, species common to today's mixed -conifer forests moved upslope to their elevation range of present -day. The warmer climate likely resulted in the widespread establishment of ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) across the mid -elevations of the area. At elevations between 1,600 and 2,100 m, pinyon -juniper woodlands dominated. In the period that followed (8,000 to 8 4,000 B.P.) pinyon -junipe r woodlands migrated into the area and cold deserts were replaced by warm desert grasses. In lower elevation regions of the Colorado Plateau, studies from the Chaco Canyon and San Juan Basins in Arizona (8,000 B.P.) showed that canyons were dominated by mi xed conifer forests and the mesa tops were cold desert steppe (Betancourt et al. 1993) Fire In the Southwestern forests, lightening and human -caused fires could burn for several months and covered thousands of acres, burning until extinguished by rain or d epletion of fuel (Swetnam 1990, Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Dendrochology research suggests that most Southwest forest stands, excluding spruce -fir, burned every 2 to 30 years as low -intensity fires. Having greater moisture yet heavier fuel loads, spruce -fir forests burned less frequently, on the order of every 35 to 150 years or more, but at higher intensities (Abolt 1997, Grissino -Mayer et al. 1995, and Veblen et al. 1994). Although native cultures used fire for a variety of purposes, lightening ignitions d uring periods of high fire hazard were sufficient to produce frequent fires (Schroeder and Buck 1970, Swetnam and Baisan 1996). Demographics and Forest Resources Humans have been an integral component of Arizona's forest ecosystems for more than 10,000 yea rs although precise regional population estimates do not exist (Dean et al. 1994). Archaeological records from around 300 B.P. indicate human populations were developing more permanent settlements and shifting to greater reliance on domesticated plants (De an et al. 1994). Impacts on forest resources were thought to have been minimal until around the 11th century when farming, fuelwood cutting, and hunting greatly increased around the larger settlements (Dahms and Geils 1997). The arrival of Europeans had a devastating impact on the native populations as well as regional environmental impacts such as intensive irrigation and introduction of diseases that threatened wildlife. The prehistoric uses of timber resources were fuel, tools, and construction and were mainly used locally due to technology and transportation limitations. For these reasons the woodlands and riparian forests near areas of population growth were most affected (Dahms and Geils 1997). For example, along the Middle Rio Grande Valley, the ripar ian bosque had been essentially eliminated by Puebloan and Hispanic farmers before 1848 (Abert 1848a, Wozniak 1987). It was not until the 19th century with the introduction of commercial logging, mining, and railroads that the upper elevation forests were impacted. Historic Forest Conditions In the early 19th century, dense woodlands could be found, but forests were predominately open with a diverse community of trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses and forbs (Abert 1848a, 1848b). The pattern of tree distrib ution is influenced by ecosystem condition as well as processes above and below ground. Historic ponderosa pine forests are often referred to as open and park -like with abundant herbaceous understory although descriptions and pictures of dense stands have also been documented (see Woolsey 1911, Covington and Moore 1994). Records and archaeological reconstruction of historic forest conditions 9 suggest that the vegetation was characterized by individual, clumped, or stringers of ponderosa pine in various sizes with an understory grass -herbaceous matrix (Dahms and Geils 1997). The development of fire-dependent vegetation coupled with the typical climate of several centuries prior to 1848 reinforced a frequent fire regime of low -intensity burns (Covington and Moo re 1994). Frequent surface fires, disease, insects, and other regulating mechanisms kept the ponderosa pine forest in balance. Conditions of historic mixed conifer forests are variable and depend on time since and severity of the most recent burn. Historic al conditions of mixed conifer forest as reported in An Assessment of Forest Health in the Southwest (Dahms and Geils 1997) describe the following: \"Lang and Stewart1 describe the mixed conifer forest on the North Kaibab Plateau (Colorado Plateau Province) in 1909. They describe most mature Douglas fir (as well as white fir and blue spruce) as \"deteriorating\"; they probably mean these trees were decayed, had poor crown form, broken tops, and hollow bases typical of repeatedly fire -damaged trees. Lang and St ewart also note that Douglas - fir regeneration was \"healthy and vigorous\"; and often dense stands of pole -sized trees covered large areas, especially on more mesic sites and under aspen.\" Because historic spruce -fir forests had little impact from logging, g razing, or fire suppression, their historic conditions are fairly well known (Dahms and Geils 1997). Spruce -fir forests were susceptible to major disturbances (i.e. fire and insect outbreak) but they occurred relatively infrequently with 100+ years between major events (Baker and Veblen 1990, Schmid and Frye 1977, Veblen et al. 1994). Riparian forests once formed continuous corridors of lush vegetation covering hundreds of miles and are also found as components of montane communities. They stretch from the headwaters of rivers and streams down to the lower elevation deserts. Many species in the riparian communities depend on flooding for seed transportation and establishment. Riparian communities provided resources necessary for early human settlements as we ll as permanent wildlife habitat and migratory routes for birds and mammals. Post -European Settlement The period following the Mexican -American War of 1848 marks a significant transition from Hispanic to American sovereignty in the Southwest and a time of rapid settlement. With the increasing settlers came cattle herds; by 1890, more than 1.5 million head of cattle were in the Southwest (Baker et al. 1988). By the early 1900s, livestock grazing pressures had reached the mountainous and timbered areas result ing in vegetation cover loss and increased erosion. Since the peak in the numbers of cattle and sheep in Arizona, around the time of World War I, livestock numbers have been declining (Dahms and Geils 1997). 1 An unpublished report titled Reconnaissance of the Kaibab National Forest, unpublished survey report circa 1910 on file Williams, AZ: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Kaibab National Forest. 10 Historic fire regime was dramatically changed be cause livestock removed much of the fine fuel needed to carry surface fires and fire suppression increased because of the growing number of inhabitants who viewed fire as a threat. Ultimately, the frequency and size of fires were altered by roads and trail s, fragmented forest continuity, the suppression of fire, and low fuel loads. Fire exclusion began altering forest structure and fire regime in the early 1900s (Covington and Moore 1994). Over the last century, the combination of fire suppression and fuel accumulation has led to the occurrence of large a nd intense fires such as experienced in the last several decades in the Southwest. With the arrival of the railroad to the Southwest, new industries appeared, human population grew, natural resource exploita tion accelerated, and the commercial economy replaced the subsistence economy. Some other concurrent changes included altered land use patterns, depletion of forage for livestock, degradation of riparian areas, and changes in forest communities and wildlif e habitat (Bahre 1991, DeBuys 1985). Arizona has continued to grow since this time, further stressing natural systems and resources. Small scale logging for local -use shifted to larger efforts around the 1870s with the construction of the railroad and harv esting of railroad ties. During these early years, large volumes (70 -80%) needed to be removed from the forests to make the operation feasible (Schubert 1974). Later, when trucks were available lighter cuts could be made - typically 30 to 60% of the availa ble volume (Myers and Martin 1963). Over time, harvesting methods have been variable with some practices more sustainable than others. Removal of the 'large quality' trees have resulted in some dense stands of younger trees thus reducing understory herbace ous cover and increasing fire danger. The transcontinental railroad also provided increased opportunities for tourism. Arizona's mild climate, striking archaeological ruins, and majestic scenery all led to a tremendous increase in recreation during the mid to late 1900s. Arizona became a favorite destination for hunting, fishing, sightseeing, and bird watching. Preservation and conservation of forests and other natural communities became a focal point for public land managers. Higher visitation to wildernes s areas and forest communities led to the overuse and exploitation of resources, introduction of non -native plants, increased human -caused fires, and unauthorized use of motorized vehicles. These and other interrelated widespread changes in Arizona have a lso altered the hydrologic regime of most every watershed. Soil compaction, road construction, and reduced ground cover have led to increased erosion and flooding, often resulting in deeply cut incised channels. Water diversions and impoundments on the lar ger rivers have significantly modified channel dynamics and altered native habitat and vegetation establishment. To address bank stabilization and other ecological problems, species not native to the ecosystems of the Southwest, like salt cedar ( Tamarix spp.) were introduced to help \"solve\" these issues. Some of these introduced species are quite aggressive, competing with native plants for resources and are currently having detrimental impacts on ecosystem processes. B. Forest Types and Distribution The d iversity of Arizona's forests range from semi -arid riparian gallery forests to subalpine and montane forests, spanning roughly 27% of the state and covering an area of 19.4 million acres (O'Brien 2002). 11 Several of these forested communities have internatio nal importance because of their outstanding biological diversity and are part of the greater geographic region referred to as the Madrean Archipelago, which has recently been added to Conservation International's list of the world's hotspots for biodiversi ty (Andrew Smith, personal communication). The great biological diversity stems from the convergence of subtropical and temperate climate zones that create forest corridors for many migratory animals. In the most general sense the USDA Forest Inventory an d Analysis Program classifies forest lands into two major categories - timberland or woodland - based on levels of stocking. Timberland is forest land with tree species such as ponderosa pine products, that make up at least 10% of the stocking. Only 20% of Arizona's forest land meets this definition (O'Brien 2002). The remaining portion is woodland, comprising all other forest lands where timber species are not present at the minimum stocking level. Woodland tree species such as pinyon ( P. edulis ) used primarily for fuelwood, fence posts and in some cases, Christmas trees. Forest lands are further differentiated into forest t ypes and are often identified by the predominant tree species. Throughout time, vegetation communities have been described using a variety of classifications and at different geographical scales. Because planning and management objectives differ, the fram ework to identify ecological units is different, as are the resultant classifications. Most of the forest lands in Arizona are within the Arizona - New Mexico Mountains Semi -Desert - Open Woodland - Coniferous Forest - Alpine Meadow Province (Bailey et al. 1994). Southwestern ecosystems are grouped into life zones (Carleton et al. 1991) which are characterized by biotic community types and can be cross -referenced to the biotic communities described by Brown and Lowe (1977, 1980) and Brown (1994). For Arizon a's Assessment of Need purposes, forest lands have been aggregated into four major forest community types - mixed conifer forests, pinyon -juniper woodlands, riparian forests, and Madrean oak woodlands. It is important to note that forest statistics can va ry depending on the source of the information, sampling method, accuracy of the data, and the definition of forest land. Therefore, the Arizona AON will report state -wide figures based on information obtained from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Pr ogram and documented in Arizona's Forest Resources, 1999 (O'Brien 2002). While all county level and forest type (conifer, pinyon -juniper woodland, Madrean oak woodland, and riparian forest) figures are based on our spatial analyses. The discrepancy in data reporting is because the geospatial data to accompany the FIA report was not available at the time the AON was developed, therefore, Arizona GAP vegetation data (1998) was used as the primary source in our spatial analyses for identifying forest lands in Arizona. Appendix A identifies the aggregation of the forest vegetation types that comprise the mixed conifer forests, pinyon -juniper woodlands, riparian forests, and Madrean oak woodlands and crosswalks them with biotic communities (Brown 1994). Identific ation of riparian forest was enhanced with spatial data from the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD 1994). Again, county level and forest type statistics will be based on the information generated from spatial analyses using the combined GAP and AZGFD vegetation data. For a complete list of geospatial information used in developing the AON see Appendix B. 12 Figure 2. Thousands of acres by forest type in Arizona (based on GAP vegetation and AZGDF data) Arizona forests are comprised of conifers and hardwoods with thirty -seven tree species (Appendix C) ranging in elevation from approximately 300 to 3,700 m. The majority of forest land is located above the Mogollon Rim with discrete patches in southeastern Arizona's mountain i slands (Figure 1). Pinyon -juniper and pure juniper woodlands are the most abundant forest type in Arizona, occupying approximately 14.8 million acres or 20.3% of the state (Chart 2). The rarest and most significant in ecological terms is riparian forest, o ccupying less than one -half a percent of the land in Arizona. Ground water pumping and conversion to non -forest uses currently threaten the riparian forests and habitat they support. 5,022.9 1,349.514,816.9 of Acres Forest Type13 Figure 3. Forest Cover Types 14 Mixed Conifer Forests In Arizona, ponderosa pine forests comprise the largest portion of the mixed conifer forest, approximately 86%. Ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) is the most widely distributed pine in North America, extending from British Columbia, Canada to Durang o, Mexico. Throughout its range, ponderosa pine can be found at elevations from sea level to about 2,750 m. In Arizona, most of the ponderosa pine forest is between 1650 and 2,760 m. At slightly higher elevations (above approximately 2400 m) a variety of c onifer species are present. At elevations between 2,400 and 3,100 m forests are dominated by Douglas -fir (Pseudotsuga (Picea pungens ).In the cooler regions and areas receiving more than 63 5 mm of annual precipitation, the spruce -fir forest is ( Abies lasiocarp). Other species that are present in mixed conifer forests include corkbark fir ( A. lasioc arpa tremulodies ). Aspens occur in small, transient patches in mixed conifer forests and because t hey are shade intolerant, they eventually succumb to competition as conifers close the canopy. The mildest climate in Arizona is found in mixed conifer forests, with average annual precipitation from 430 to 760 mm (USDA 2004b) and as high as 1100 mm in the higher elevations (USDA 2004a). More than half of the precipitation falls as snow and the mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 8 degrees Celsius (USDA 2004b). Madrean Oak Woodland Evergreen oak woodland, characterized by wet summers and mild winters , extends from the Sierra Madre of Mexico into southeastern Arizona and Southwestern New Mexico and ranges in elevation from 880 to 2,300 m (Brown 1994) and up to the top of Mount Graham at 3,260 m (USDA 2004b). The Madrean oak woodlands in Arizona general ly include evergreen oak species as well as conifer species. Most of the woodlands are found primarily in \"sky islands\" of southeastern Arizona at an elevation gradient (1,200 to 2,700 m) above the desert shrub and grassland communities at low elevations b ut below the coniferous forests at the higher elevations. At the lower elevations, the woodlands are typically open with bunch grasses as the major understory component. At the higher elevations they are denser forests with oak and pine species intermixed. Madrean oak woodland's northern range is in central Arizona where it occurs above or within the drier interior chaparral, and below and along drainages within the drier and cold tolerant Great Basin conifer woodland (Brown 1994). 15 Figure 4. Madrean Oak Woodland In Arizona, a variety of oak species such as Emory oak ( Quercus emoryi ), Arizona white oak (Q. rugosa ) are found at higher elevations in conjunction with Madrean pine species such as Apache pine (Pinus engelmannii ), Chihuahua pine ( P. Arizona pine ( P. arizonica ). Arizona cypress, endemic to the woodlands, is confined mainly to north -facing canyon slopes and drainages. If there is sufficient moisture, epiphytic bromeliads ( Tillandsia recurvata ) can be found on tree the common understory grasses include muhlys commonly found in the understory of many of these forests (Brown 1994). The abundance of scrub land species from the interior chaparral community such can be occasional or frequent within the Madrean oak woodland. These and other indicative plants of chaparral are typically prominent on thin eroded soils, limestone, and near the e astern and northern range of the Madrean oak woodlands (Brown 1994). Annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 750 mm at the higher elevations. There is both snow and rain precipitation with winter -summer ratios about equal (USDA 2004b). Snow seldom persist s more than few days at the lowest elevations. 16 Pinyon -Juniper Woodlands Pinyon -juniper woodlands constitute the largest forest type in Arizona, both on public and private land. These coniferous woodlands exist in a gradient of juniper dominated woodlands t o pinyon dominated woodlands with pinyon pines and junipers present throughout the range. Specifically, they are found at elevations ranging from approximately 1,370 to 2,300 m (USDA 2004a). Pinyon ( Pinus edulis) is the most common species in the complex w ith other pines including border pinyon ( P. discolor ) and californarium subspp. fallax ). Juniper species are typically found at lower elevations than pinyons and at sites with deeper soils (Dahms and One -seed jun juniper below the Mogollon Rim. Other juniper species that are found in Arizona include Rocky Mountain juniper ( J. scopulorum ) and Utah juniper and alligator juniper ( J. deppeana ) in southern Arizona which is also associated with Madrean oak woodlands (Brown 1994, Gottfried 1992). Figure 5. Pinyon -Juniper Woodlands Understory vegetation is dependent primarily upon rainfall and soil type. Herbaceo us vegetation is the main understory component consisting of cool and warm season grasses and forbs such as several of other grasses provide the necessary forage for livestock and wildlife. Important shrubs in the understory include cliffrose ( mahogany (Cercopcarpus spp.). Annual precipitation varies from 300 to 600 mm with occasional snow precipitation. With a few exceptions the topography of the pinyon -juniper woodlands are gently rolling hills will slopes not likely to exceed 25% (USDA 2 004a). 17 Riparian Forest Arizona's riparian ecosystems range from sea level to 3,050 m. Riparian forests exist as a component of the forest and woodlands previously discussed in addition to other vegetation communities at lower elevations like the semi -dese rt grasslands and Sonoran desert. The vegetation found along riparian corridors is dependent upon availability of water throughout the year or at least during the growing season. Some riparian forests are sustained by regulated water from dam release or re servoirs. Figure 6. Riparian Forest Due to elevation gradient, upland community, soil type, and precipitation, riparian vegetation is highly variable. At the higher elevations, typical overstory of occur along with montane coniferous species, white fir and blue spruce. The understory is comprised of various shrubs such -leaf alder ( virens ). In the mid - to lower elevations, a mixture of deciduous broadleaf species such as Arizona sycamore Fraxinus velutina) dominate the forest canopy. Many of the riparian forests at the mid to lower elevation have been taken over or are in part invaded by introduced tamarisk many of the upper terraces at lower elevations. The climatic characteristics of riparian ecosystems exhibit a wide range of conditions due to large elevation differences and distributions of associated mountain ran ges, highlands, and desert valleys. Riparian ecosystem topography can vary from narrow, deep, steep -walled canyon bottoms, to intermediately exposed sites with at least one terrace or bench, to exposed, wide valleys with meandering streams. C. Forest Landowners The majority of forest lands (42%) are administered b y USDA Forest Service, 6% by DFFM , 10% are private, 31% are tribal and the rema ining 10% are other public . Ownership of the riparian forests and 18 pinyon -juniper woodlands are almost equa lly divided between public and private whereas the mixed conifer forest and Madrean oak woodlands are primarily in public ownership. Arizona does not report any industrial private forests (IPF) which are forest lands owned by timber - industry corporations. Non-industrial private forests (NIPF), which are held by individuals or private corporations, account for 10% of the state's timber and woodlands. The NIPF land is primarily used by landowners for cattle ranching. Based on state, organization, and agency records, it is difficult to quantify the number of private forest landowners in Arizona. It can be inferred based on Arizona's growing population and demand for development that a reduction in private forest land acres has occurred over the last half centu ry. Additional information regarding trends in forest land can be found in the Forest Land Conversion section below. D. Timber and Wood Products Today, Arizona's forest lands comprise an estimated 19.4 million acres with an estimated 1.8 million acres, or 9%, reserved from utilization for wood products (O'Brien 2002). Reserved forests have been set aside as wilderness areas, National Parks and Monuments, and other similar areas. Timber management is permitted on the remaining 17.6 million acres of non -rese rved forest lands of which all state and private forest lands are considered. The earliest Southwest forest inventory was conducted by Woolsey in 1910, however, these and other early inventories were not comprehensive of the southwest thus it is difficult to make comparisons in acreage, densities or productivity prior to the 1950s when the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service began conducting inventories. An inventory of tree density conducted in mixed conifer forests in Arizona and New Mexico fo und 20.8 trees/acre in 1962 and 93.6 trees/acre in 1985/1987. These changes coincided with an increase in mixed conifer forests and a decrease in ponderosa pine and aspen forests (Johnson 1994). However, having more trees is not necessarily good from a nat ural resource manager's perspective. As forests grow more dense and homogenous, forest fire characteristics change as does wildlife habitat. With fire largely eliminated from western forests in the last century and harvests far below growth levels, these f ire-adapted ecosystems have become at risk to stand replacing fires as well as forests dominated by vegetation in the mid -succession stages (Johnson et al. 2000). Because of the importance of wood products in the economy, the FIA Program of the Forest Serv ice provides additional summary information for 3.6 million acres of non -reserved timberland in Arizona (O'Brien 2002). The FIA includes statistics on biomass, volume, and growth of forest land, which is necessary to consider when discussing harvest, remov al, and mortality. As an example of forest growth and removal (timber harvest) figures for the Intermountain West (includes Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming), Figure 7 depicts the decreasing trend in removals while net growth continues to increase. While these figures are not readily available for Arizona, the trend is similar. The fol lowing discussion includes additional details that are Arizona specific. 19 Figure 7. National Forest Net Growth and Removals, Interior West - 1952 -1997 . Reproduced with permission from M. Johnson. 2000. US Forest Service To give an idea of Arizona's overall stand structure, 71% of the forest area is characterized as sawtimber, which are large tree stands with at least 10% stocking of live trees in which more than half of the stocking is from live trees with a diameter 127 mm (5.0 in ches) or greater (O'Brien 2002). Relatively few stands (4%) are composed of saplings and seedlings. This pattern is consistent across land ownership. For both public and private forest lands, the pinyon -juniper woodlands is the greatest contributor to sawt imber. When considering timberland and woodland collectively, most stand characteristics are skewed toward the dominant forest type - pinyon -juniper (see O'Brien 2002). Current timber product information is also collected by the FIA Units. For Arizona, t he total volume of roundwood produced for 2002 is 12.6 million cubic feet of which 8.0 million cubic feet is from private land (this figure includes tribal forest lands) (USDA 2002). One third of Arizona's timberland, is dominated by ponderosa pine sawtimb er stands and is NIPF (this figure includes tribal lands). Ponderosa pine accounts for 76% of the total sawtimber volume as well as a majority of the poletimber and sapling/seedling stand types. Tree removals were primarily for timber products (92%) with t he remainder split between fuelwood and logging residue. Sawlogs accounted for the largest component (69%) of the growing stock removed, followed by pulpwood (22%). The remainder is categorized as miscellaneous wood products (O'Brien 2002). Other lands, pr imarily Indian Tribal Trust lands, supplied 59% of the volume removed and National Forests contributed 41%. Although ponderosa pine contributed to over 84% of the volume, overall, each individual species such as Douglas -fir, true fir, and spruce contribute d proportionally to its share of the total inventory. E. Insect Impacts Numerous species of insects, fungi, and parasitic plants have co -evolved with trees of Southwestern forests. However, trees that are closer together tend to be more susceptible to di sease and insect attack 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,600 1952 1962 1977 1987 1991 1997Million Cubic Feet YearNet Growth Removal20 than trees more widely spaced (Sartwell and Steven 1975). Some of these species have the ability to cause widespread tree mortality, defoliation, decay, or deformity thus acting as natural disturbance agents. These agents along with fire are some of the most important regulators of forest condition. In turn, forest condition affects the distribution and reproduction of forest insects and pathogens (Dahms and Geils 1997). In Arizona, the species of particular interest include the num erous species of bark beetles Arceuthobium ), and root decay fungi. Bark beetles are generally host specific and are present usually in low numbers but will periodically increase to outbreak levels. Rapid tree mort ality is the result of successful bark beetle attacks unless the damage is restricted to only a portion of the bole (Stark 1982). Western spruce budworm ) are the two main de foliating insects in Arizona. Spruce and fir trees are the principle host for western spruce budworms and can become completely defoliated when outbreaks persist for several years (Linnane 1986). The western tent caterpillar feeds on Aspen foliage and can result in extensive defoliation, growth loss, top kill, or mortality (Jones et al. 1985). Moreover, research has demonstrated that bark beetles, mountain pine beetle, Douglas -fir beetle, spruce budworm, and dwarf mistletoe are pests that tend to increase i n denser forests (see Johnson 1994). III. Arizona's Forest Resources (non -timber) Timber production has historically been and likely will always be the primary function and definitively the most consumptive use of Arizona's forests. However, forest land serves other anthropogenic purposes such as recreation, tourism, mining, and grazing. Perhaps more importantly, forest lands contribute to the overall functioning of ecosystems by playing a vital role in the watershed. Arizona's forest lands, often surroun ded by semi -arid landscapes, provide critical habitat to a suite of forest obligate wildlife. A. Recreational, Cultural, and Scenic Resources Recreation and tourism use of forest lands has been steadily increasing for many western states, Arizona in parti cular. Recreation is one of the primary uses of Arizona's forests, offering opportunities such as sightseeing, hiking, cross country skiing, bird watching, hunting, horse -back riding, and fishing. Most any place in Arizona (non -tribal areas) is within 8 km of land open to the public for a variety of recreational activities. There are over 3.8 million acres designated as wilderness within Arizona (a portion of this would be classified by the U.S. Forest Service as reserved forest land) and several thousand m ore acres managed specifically for resource protection (i.e., Area of Critical Environmental Concern, National Conservation Areas). Not only do the forests draw many out of town visitors, many Arizonians use the forests for cool retreats in the summer. Th e Arizona State Parks recently released data showing that two -thirds of Arizonians consider themselves trail users. Millions of out -of-state visitors also use Arizona's trails each year. In April 21 2004, Arizona Senators McCain and Kyle, introduced the Arizo na Trail Feasibility Study Act. This bill would authorize the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to conduct a joint study to determine the feasibility of designating the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic or National Historic Trail. The trail covers 7 90 miles of public lands, mountains, canyons, deserts, forests, historic sites, and communities. The Trail begins at the Coronado National Memorial on the U.S. -Mexico border and ends in the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Strip District on the Utah bor der. The corridor for the Arizona Trail encompasses the wide range of ecological diversity in the state, and incorporates a host of existing trails into one continuous trail. The Southwest is an area rich is history and culture. Hundreds of landmarks thro ughout Arizona document the lives and traditions of Native Americans including some of the larger tribes such as the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni. Once a part of Mexico, Arizona has many roots in Hispanic cultures and descendents. In the more recent past, histor ical records and artifacts from the pioneer days, gold rush, and dust bowl are documented throughout the state. Cultural resources have been recorded through systematic surveys by the Arizona State Museum, the State Historic Preservation Office and others. Other resources have been recorded without a formal or recorded survey. These resources can encompass such ite ms ranging in magnitude from a bone fragment, pottery shard, or bead to a well, wall foundation, or village. Cultural resources are recorded in a multitude of ways across the landscape. Details to the specific location and resource content is confidential. As one might expect, there is a greater likelihood that archeological artifacts will be found near (historic) permanent water sources. Based on information provided by the Arizona State Museum (ASM), the number of acres where cultural resources have been identified forest lands is provided in Table 1). Table 1. Number of acres of known cultural resources on private forest lands (ASM 2004) Forest Type Forest Acres with Cultural Resources Mixed Conifer Forest 3,298,616 Madrean 307,377 Visual resources include scenic roads, wild and scenic rivers, and national parks, forests, and trails. These select designations focus on not only the actual feature themselves but also include thousands of acres in the viewshed2 of these scenic roads. Arizona Department of Transportation reports 22 designated parkway, s cenic, or historic roads. Just under half of these special designation roads pass through forest lands. Outstanding examples include the Kaibab Plateau -North Rim Parkway which begins at Jacob Lake and traverses thorough pine, fir, and aspen forests or the Historic Route 66 which tells a tale of an emerging state and nation. The White Mountain Scenic Road passes through dense ponderosa pine 2 The landscape which can be seen from the vanta ge of a particular viewpoint. 22 forested mountains, stretching across the Mogollon Rim while the Dry Creek Scenic Road offers spectacular panoramic vie ws of Red Rock Country. Streams in the desert Southwest and the riparian communities they support are a unique and important resource in Arizona. Although there are only a few free -flowing rivers remaining in Arizona, many stretches support mixed deciduous and cottonwood -willow gallery forests, offering a distinct contrast to the surrounding uplands. These relic communities are adapted to early Tertiary climates and have retreated to pockets where the warm temperate climate persists together with suitable w ater regimes. Even though 980 miles of river segments have been identified as suitable for wild and scenic river designation in the last decade, only the Verde River, designated in 1984, has been officially named a scenic river area (22.2 miles classified as wild and 18.3 miles as scenic). In addition to the scenic beauty of these lush areas, rivers and lakes (primarily manmade) they provide ample recreation activities such as rafting, kayaking, tubing, jet skiing, boating, and fishing. B. Geologic Feature s and Mineral Resources Arizona has some of the most impressive and striking geologic landscapes. From the Basin and Range Province in southern Arizona, up the Mogollon Rim to the mountainous Central Highlands, and across the Colorado Plateau Province in t he north, 2 billion years of geologic events are evident. In each province, geology has played the dominant role in the character and structure of mountains, canyons, valleys, and cliffs. In the Basin and Range Province, desert valleys are surrounded by mo untain ranges of different structural patterns and rock composition. Several \"mountain -building episodes\" occurred through cracking and jointing, and crushing and upward thrusting as a result of continents colliding (Chronic 1983). The Central Highlands, a diagonal swath through the middle of the state is a transition zone between the southern and western Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau provinces and exhibits features of both. Ranges in the Central Highlands are typically clustered, narrow, shallow , with few basins. The Colorado Plateau resembles a layering of flat -topped strata separated by cliffs and steep slopes. The geological history of Arizona is described over four eras, the Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic History, in several e xcellent resources (see Chronic 1983, Smiley et al. 1984, Nations and Stump 1996). Common sedimentary rocks of Arizona include sandstone, shale, conglomerate, limestone and caliche; common igneous rocks include granite, monzonite, basalt, andesite, dacite, marble, quartzite, greenstone, gneiss, and schist. The Colorado Plateau reveals a coherent geological history of 600 million years and more. The Grand Canyon through which the Colorado River runs, is t he most popular and famous geological feature in the Colorado Plateau. Others include Sunset Crater, Painted Desert, Kaibab Plateau, Marble Canyon, and the Vermilion Cliffs. One of the most distinctive features of the Central Highlands is the Mogollon Rim. Other interesting geological features include Oak Creek Canyon, Verde Valley, Superstition Mountains, and the Salt River Canyon. The Basin and Range Province is were most of the copper mining occurs. Some noteworthy geological features in this province in clude Sand Tank Mountains, Dos Cabezas Mountains, Chiricahua 23 Mountains, the lower Colorado River floodplain, Black Mountains, San Pedro River Valley, Hualapai Mountains, and Katchners caverns (Chronic 1983). Mining in Arizona began in earnest during the 1 870s and 1880s. Arizona led the nation in value of non - fuel minerals produced for many years, primarily because of the abundance of copper and copper -related minerals (AZGS 2004). About 65% of the nation's copper is mined in Arizona. While copper mining dominates the mineral output, precious metals (gold and silver) contributed 2% of the state's total mineral production (Goerold 1989). In 1998, Arizona produced $3.03 million worth of energy and mineral commodities (Phillips et al. 2000). The mining industry in Arizona is dominated by the following five companies: ASARCO, AZCO, Cambior, Grupo Mexico, and Phelps Dodge. Other metallic commodities produced, listed in order of decreasing value, include gold, silver, molybdenum, and lead. Non -metallic (industrial or construction related) minerals produced include sand and gravel, crushed stone, clay, cement, gypsum, lime, perlite, pumice, and salt. Arizona's turquoise, peridot, petrified wood, azurite, and malachite are world -famous (AZGS 2004). Arizona produces en ergy resources such as coal and small quantities of petroleum and natural gas. Uranium output is extracted from several underground mines near the rims of the Grand Canyon. There are also several thousand thermal springs and wells throughout the state with a higher concentration south of the 20oC ground -water isotherm (Witcher et al. 1982). C. Arizona's woodlands -- pinyon -juniper, juniper, Madrean oak, and mesquite are considered rangelands. All forest and woodland commun ities were historically or are currently used for grazing (Conner et al. 1990). Grazing occurs on private land as well as public land under a fee permit system. Cattle are the primary livestock grazers but sheep, goats, horses, and burros are also found in smaller herd sizes throughout the state. The woodlands are primarily used for grazing during the winter and cattle are moved to higher mixed conifer forests during the summer. Numerous studies have documented the impact of grazing in riparian areas (see Kauffman et al. 1983, Elmore and Kauffman 1994, and Ohmart 1996) thus, a concerted effort has been made to reduce the number of livestock and the time in which cattle graze in these fragile habitats. D. Watershed Resources Arizona's forest lands, whether it is in large landscapes across the Mogollon Rim or in the isolated mountain islands of Southeastern Arizona, are of critical importance to the economy, wildlife, and watershed. As the population of Arizona increases, the demand for water also increases. Over the last several decades, water has become the most significant and fragile resource in Arizona. 24 Figure 8. Watershed, stream, and river map 25 Most of the streams in Arizona have their headwaters in mixed conifer forests and are often perennial; watershed management of this forest type is essential to numerous economical and ecological resources. Lower in elevation, particularly in the Madrean oak and pinyon -juniper woodlands, there are few perennial streams, most flow only du ring snow melt and following heavy monsoon rains as groundwater in the woodlands is typically deep and in limited supply (USDA 2004b). The Southeastern Arizona watersheds of the oak woodland are important for municipal and domestic water for communities su ch as Safford and Tombstone (USDA 2004b). Much of the runoff from the oak woodlands around the Mogollon Rim contributes to the Salt and Verde Rivers, which supply much of the Phoenix basin. The Arizona Watershed Program (AWP) is a joint initiative and rese arch network for public agencies and private groups interested in obtaining more water for future economic growth while maintaining the state's watersheds in good condition. The primary focus of the AWP is to work with the USDA Forest Service, their cooper ators, and others to obtain and extrapolate research findings on water yield improvement to large -scale watershed management practices designed to increase water yields by manipulating vegetative cover. This collaborative program was the focus of watershed research in Arizona through the 1960s, 1970s, and into the early 1980s (USDA 2004a). E. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Wildlife communities tended to be more diverse prior to European settlement (Covington et al. 1994). Changes in community structure and compo sition as well as size have lead to some species bieng extripated, others have declined, and some have even increased. Species that prefer open forests such as Grace's row (Spizella passerina ) may have declined (Finch et al. 1977). From information provided by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, 391 federal and state threatened and endangered species and agency sensitive species have been identified on private forestl ands. Of the threatened, endangered, and sensitive species, there are 230 plants, 131 vertebrates, and 40 invertebrates. Thirty -two different endangered species occur on private forest land, 14 threatened, and 10 species are proposed as candidates for list ing. Cochise County has the highest diversity and number of occurrences of these special status species and Yuma County the lowest. Mixed Conifer Forest The more open canopies in woodland, ponderosa pine, and mixed conifer forests favor wildlife species such as deer, bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ), songbirds, and small rodents. Game animals occurring in mixed conifer forest include elk ( Cervus elphus gentilis atricapillus ) prefer forests with more closed canopies; others such as the Mexican spotted owl ( Sirix occidentalis lucida ) prefer habitats with vertical structure, as provided in steep canyons or tall, diverse forests. Other birds on upper elevation forests include bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus The listing of Mexican spotted owl and other threatened species such as the Northern Goshawk, curtailed timber harvesting in the early 1990s. 26 Madrean Oak Woodland In Arizona, the principle habitat for white of the Madrean oak woodland include yellow -nosed cotton and pronghorn antelope ( Antilocapra americana ) -- depend on the understory grasslands of this forest type for forage. Small mammals characteristic of the pinyon -juniper woodland include several species of fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus ). The open spaces between trees makes excellent hunting areas for numerous raptors like the Cooper's hawk jamaicensis ). Only a few bird species are closely associated with the pinyon -juniper woodland they Forest Perennial sources of water in the semi -arid Southwest are vital to Arizona's biological richness. In Arizona and New Mexico, over 65% of the animals depend on riparian habitats during all or part of their life cycles (Dahms a nd Geils 1997). Some riparian obligate species ( canadensis ), leopard frogs (Rana spp.), and cat ( Bassariscus astutus ), and deer use protective cover of riparian forests as mig ratory corridors. Several species of bats, particularly myotises, inhabit riparian forests. Most of Arizona's native fish depend on the overstory canopy to keep water temperatures and dissolved oxygen optimal. Some common native fish include several specie s of dace ( Rhinichthys spp.), suckers in species of chub ( Gila spp.). Arizona Partners In Flight reports that approximately 238 of the more than 500 species of birds found in Arizona are neotropical migrants ( AZGFD 2004). While not all bird migrants in Arizona use riparian corridors as migratory routes, this is the predominate pathway for some of the more illusive species like the Southwestern such as hummingbirds, swallows, warblers, and orioles. F. Forest Soils and Productivity Volcanic basalt and cinders are the most common soil parent materials in Arizona (57%), although sedimentary soils (43%) are also found throughout Arizona's forests. The topography of Arizona's forests 27 are characterized by extensive flat, rolling mesas, intermixed with steeper, mountainous terrain, and a diversity of slope and aspect combinations (USDA 2004a). Mixed Conifer Forest Mollic Eutoboralfs are the most extensive soils in mixed conifer forests. These soils are moderately deep to deep, stony to cindery, vary in origin, well drained, and have textures ranging from loam to clay (USDA 2004b). The deep soil materials allow for deep water penetrati on and storage. The physical properties of the soil, and thus its moisture -retaining capacity, play an important role in the development of ponderosa pine, possibly more than the chemistry of the soil itself (USDA 2004a). Increased water at a site and high water tables associated with springs tends to increase site productivity regardless of the soil type and landform (USDA 2004a). Madrean Oak Woodland Ustolls, ustalfs, and aqualfs are the common soils in the Madrean oak woodland mesic temperature regime. The Ustolls can be very shallow to moderately deep, have a medium to fine texture, and be gravelly and cobbly. Ustalfs tend to be deep, fine textured and range in percent composition of gravel. Aqualfs are also deep but very gravelly and fine textured (USD A 2004b). Pinyon - Juniper Woodland The soils in the pinyon -juniper woodlands are mostly Haplustalfs and Argiustolls with a smaller portion covered by Haplustolls (USDA 2004b). Soils are derived from basalt, limestone, and sandstone parent material and va ry in texture, depth, and mineralogy (USDA 2004a). Riparian Forest The surrounding uplands, parent material, and soils influence the riparian soils. At the higher elevations riparian soils generally consist of consolidated or unconsolidated alluvial sediments from parent materials of the surrounding uplands. Soil depths are variable and depend upon stream gradient, topographic setting, and parent materials. Soils on the flood plains at lower elevations consist of recent depositions, tend to be uniform within horizontal strata, and exhibit little development (USDA 2004a). IV. Forest Trends and Threats The USDA Forest Service has been providing figures for forest area since 1953 with estimates back to 1630, which are based on partial inventories, or est imates from surveyors' data (see Smith et al. 2001 p. 65 for further details on forest area information resources). It is important to note that the figures reported here are based on gross estimates and make comparisons over time difficult because of the variety of sampling design and intensity, and survey standards and definitions used over time. In 1938, an estimated 20.1 million acres of total forest area were reported by the U.S. Congress and in 1997, the USDA Forest Service estimated 19.4 million acre s; a loss of 3.4% in forest land (USDA 2003b). An estimated 1.3 28 million acres of private timberland was reported in 1953 (36.4% of all timberland in 1953) and by 2002, the area declined by 18.2% to 1.1 million acres. This loss far exceeds the loss of 2.6% in total timberland for all owners (USDA 2003b). During this same time period (1953 -2002), the net volume of all growing stock on private timberland grew from 148 to 1,941 million cubic feet, an increase of over 1,200% (USDA 2003b). When comparing this to the increase of 29.7% in net volume of growing stock for all land owners, it becomes evident that forest land is being cleared for timber products and most likely development. In the 2002 -2003 Annual Report, the ASLD documents over 4 million acres in sta te forest land. These lands are managed to maximize and sustain income but also to enhance wildlife, watershed, range and open space values. The ASLD also provides technical, educational, and financial support to private landowners in the management of the ir forest lands. Arizona participates in several of the cooperative forestry programs and assisted 1,112 landowners during the 2002 -2003 fiscal year bringing the total acres of private forest with cooperative forestry management plans to 1,136,800 (ASLD 20 03). The National Association of State Foresters summarizes information for all state and private forests across the United States. Arizona's forestry funding support for 2002 was a fraction of the other four -corner states, totaling under $4 million dollar s compared to 25.6 million average for the other three states (NASF 2002). In Arizona, like most other western states, fire control, prevention, and management are the largest expenditures for forestry programs. A. Demographics Increasing population and e conomic growth over the last 35 years has had, and will continue to have consequences for natural ecosystems in Arizona. Unless profound efforts are made to conserve lands of strategic importance to biodiversity and environmental sustainability rather than plowing them under for housing and paving them over for commercial development projects, the wild and scenic landscapes that support wildlife and the human spirit will cease to exist. From 1970 to 2000 Arizona's population grew by 3,370,362 people, a 188 % increase (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). That growth has increased even more dramatically in the last four years with the current population now estimated at 5,435,675 people, making Arizona the second fastest growing state in the U.S. behind Nevada. Based on current rates of population growth, Arizona's projected population for 2050 is 11.2 million people; see Figure 9 (U.S. Census Bureau 2000). 29 Figure 9. Actual and projected percent population growth relative to 1980, by county (1980 - 2050)* B. Changes in the Economy and Forest Land Conversion A report by the American Farmland Trust, Strategic Ranchland in the Rocky Mountain West Mapping the Threats to Prime Ranchland in Seven Western States, found that over 1.3 million acres of Arizona's best ranchland is at risk of being converted to low -density development in the next 20 years (AFT 2004). This land is not only economically important to Arizon a, but is ecologically and culturally important as well. Net income from farming and ranching dropped from $565 million in 1970 to $377 million in 2000 - a decrease of 33% ( Figure 10). Compared to other industry sectors, the farming and agriculture industry has had a net loss of new income between 1970 and 2000 while the services and professional industry which includes construction, real estate and trade has increased new income during this same time period by 48% ( Figure 11). And while all other segments of Arizona's economy have been booming, the farm sector has lost nearly 5,000 jobs in the last 30 years. -1000100200300400500 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050Percent Yuma30 Figure Labor earnings fr om farming and ranching in Arizona; 1970 -2000. Source: Headwaters Economics, Economic Profile System Furthermore, due to a variety of circumstances including drought, fire suppression, climate change, and falling beef prices, ranching as a livelihood has b een declining in the latter half of the 20th century. For these reasons and others such as overgrazing, many publicly owned, privately leased grazing allotments are not being re -issued. Consequently, many ranchers are selling their land to others who often subdivide the land into smaller parcels for development. Agriculture has a long history in Arizona. In fact, cattle, cotton, and citrus make up three of the \"Five C's\" that have long been considered the driving force behind Arizona's economy. As the top industry in Arizona, agriculture (which includes ranching and forestry) produces over 18% of the nation's lettuce crop; in fact agriculture and related industries contribute over $4.5 billion dollars to state reserves (AFT 2004). Despite these impressive n umbers, however, some of the best agricultural lands in Arizona are being lost to unplanned sprawling development. Due to drought and falling prices for beef, many Arizona farmers have begun to sell their water rights and irrigated land to nearby communiti es, especially as land and water sales are becoming more profitable than agriculture itself. A similar pattern is reflected in the higher elevation forestlands. The Grand Canyon State faces many problems typical of states with a successful economy: an infl ux of new citizens building primary and secondary homes in and near fast growing cities like Phoenix and Tucson. As urban areas grow and sprawl, city dwellers seek cooler forest elevations for reprieve from the desert heat as well as for the recreational o pportunities. Many of these second homes are built upon subdivided forest land parcels, offering low -density rural development with roads and fences fragmenting the landscape. In the American Farmland Trust report, Strategic Ranchland in the Rocky Mountain West Mapping the Threats to Prime Ranchland in Seven Western States (2004), Pinal County was identified as 1 of 25 counties in the seven western Rocky Mountain States with strategic ranchlands most at risk. 600,000800,0001,000,0001,200,0001,400,0001,600,0001,800,0002,000,000Millions of Dollars Year31 Figure 11. Labor earn ings by industry sector; 1970 -2000. Source: Headwaters Economics, Economic Profile System Private forest land near smaller communities found at higher elevations are also quickly being subdivided, sold, and developed. Open space in the White Mountains and Verde Valley are selling at a premium price. From Century 21 listings in the White Mountains, land is ranging in price from $10,000 to $30,000 per acre. Residential building permits for the City of Show Low were 174 in 2001 compared to the surrounding town s of Snowflake with 46 permits and Pinetop -Lakeside with 56 permits (White Mountain Regional Development Corporation 2004). In the Prescott area, construction of new single -family homes has been steadily increasing; in 1996 there were 241 permits granted a nd by 2002, that number increased to 636 permits issued (City Data.com 2004). Similar trends are occurring in Prescott Valley and Chino Valley. Information from these sources also indicates that the average cost of new single -family homes has more than dou bled over this six -year time frame. Based upon site visits and real estate searches, areas around Heber and Overgaard are actively growing but because these towns are unincorporated, accessing building permit records was not feasible. Other small towns suc h as Sonoita and Elgin are also growing by converting open space into low -density housing yet approximate figures are not available. 05,000,00010,000,00015,000,00020,000,00025,000,00030,000,00035,000,00040,000,00045,000,000Millions of Dollars Year Farm Mining Construction Manufacturing Transportation and public utilities Wholesale Trade Retail Trade Finance, insurance, and real estate Services32 C. Resources Most Vulnerable Many natural and cultural resources are at risk of degradation, destruction, or elimination. Some of the resources most vulnerable to forest conversion or fragmentation include forest obligate animals and their vegetation community habitats, ecosystem processes such as decomposition and infiltration, and archeological sites in riparian forests. N umerous other ecological and economical resources in private forestland are also susceptible to damage or depletion once conversion of forest land to non -traditional forest uses commences. Regular economic and environmental analyses point to the diminishme nt of Arizona's natural resources and scenic lands: \"The State of the Environment for 2002 published by the Sierra Club reports that development consumes one acre an hour in Maricopa County and one acre every two hours in Pima County. As we continue this p ace of conversion of land from natural habitat to the built environment we threaten the natural resources we value\" - Arizona Open Land Trust \"The American West is undergoing rapid land use change, especially on the 170,000 square miles of grazed grasslan ds and woodlands in private ownership. These lands, rather than the higher elevation public lands managed by federal agencies, hold most of the biodiversity of our region. And yet, as they are rapidly developed and fragmented, their value as large intact w ildlands is being immeasurably diminished. A recent study of land subdivision and habitat fragmentation in northern Arizona - commissioned by the Arizona Cattle Growers' Association - reveals just how much is currently being lost. Since 1959, 2.2 million a cres of private lands in northern Arizona along the I - 40 corridor have been platted or sold.\" - Center for Sustainable Environments, Northern Arizona University V. Protection of Arizona's Forest Lands A. Protected Forest Land in Arizona Almost half (46%) of Arizona's forest land is managed by the Department of Agriculture or Interior and has some level of natural resource conservation. The Gap Analysis Program (available online at http://www.gap.udaho.edu/ handbook ) assigns a management status category to the land units irrespective of land ownership. The ranking system consists of four categories (Scott et al. 1993) that relate to the strength of designation with respect to maintenance of biodiversity values: Status 1 : An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state with in which disturbance events (of 33 natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management. Status 2: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandat ed management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive uses or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities, including suppression of natural disturbance. Status 3: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover for the majority of the area, but subject to extractive uses of either a broad, low -intensity type ( e.g., logging) or localized intense type ( e.g., mining). It also confers protecti on to federally listed endangered and threatened species throughout the area. Status 4: There are no known public or private institutional mandates or legally recognized easements or deed restrictions held by the managing entity to prevent conversion of na tural habitat types to anthropogenic habitat types. The area generally allows conversion to unnatural land cover throughout. Based on a spatial analyses of the Arizona Gap management status, 2.3 million acres of forestlands are identified as offering prote ction status. As a forest type, pinyon -juniper woodlands represent 69.3% of the acres with protection status of Gap 1 and 2. Within any given forest type, Madrean oak woodlands has the largest percent of total forest land in protection status Gap 1 and 2 ( 19.9%), and mixed conifer forest has the smallest (7.6%) amount of land afforded Gap protection status 1 and 2. In Arizona, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) identified over 8.1 million acres of forest habitat for conservation during their ecoregional assessme nts. Of this forest habitat identified, 23% (1.85 million acres) have Gap status 1 or 2. Of this selected forest habitat, 9.0% is in private ownership. B. Conservation Easements in Arizona Numerous conservation easements are held by a variety of land tru st organizations, local, state, and federal agencies, and other interested parties concerned with preservation of open space and natural ecosystems. Through various means, land trusts have conserved over 3.2 million acres in the United States (Land Trust A lliance 1998). While each entity holding conservation easements may have information regarding the total number of acres conserved, there is no statewide clearinghouse of such information nor would this information be partitioned according to the forest ty pes identified within the AON, thus, only a few examples are provided below. According to the latest records for The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Arizona chapter, 42,000 acres of private land have conservation easements held by TNC. The Malpai Borderlands Gr oup holds conservation easements on 75,000 acres of private land in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Grand Canyon Trust holds conservation easements on 12,500 acres, primarily in northern Arizona. While the Trust for Public Land is active in Arizona, they work primarily with 34 local land trusts, which in turn hold the conservation easements. Thirteen percent of Arizona is State Trust Lands and information regarding conservation easements on this land is not available. Land trusts are nonprof it organizations, as described in 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that protect land by working with landowners who wish to donate or sell fee title or conservation easements to maintain conservation values associated with the land (USDA 2003a). The following are some of the land trusts and conservation organizations working individually and collectively to preserve land for the protection and sustainability of Arizona's rich bio -diversity, wildlife habitats, scenic and recreational areas, and ec onomic diversification: Arizona Open Land Trust 1915 E Arizona Open Land Trust (AOLT) protects Southern Arizona's vanishing western landscapes and wildlife habitat by acquiring and managing sensitive lands, and supporting their mission through appropriate legislation, public education, and outreach. The trust operates in Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties Black Mount ain Conservancy PO Box 7192 Cave Creek, AZ 85327 -7192 Phone: (480) 575 -5835 Founded: 2000 www.blkmtnconservancy.org The Black Mountain Conservancy is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) volunteer organization dedic ated to preserving, in perpetuity, the undeveloped land on and around Black Mountain. The vision of the Conservancy is to protect, preserve, and restore for the public benefit, a unique mountain for current and future generations. Cascabel Hermitage Associ ation 6146 N 212 -2473 www.cascabelhermitage.org The Cascabel Hermitage Association (CHA) acquires and holds real property in trust under the Saguaro - Junipe r Covenant, makes the land available for solitary meditation, and holds conservation easements. It 35 thereby provides a Sonoran desert wildlands habitat for fully interfaith solitary contemplation, as well as other solitary educational and creative activitie s that require sustained concentration and stillness. Central Arizona Land Trust PO Box www.centralazlandtrust.org The Central Arizona Land Trust is a private, non -profit organization established in 1989. They seek to preserve ranchlands, open space and the scenic and wildlife values of central Arizona in partnership with landowners who wish to protect their land in pe rpetuity. Desert Foothills Land Trust PO Box 4861 85327 -4861 Phone: (480) 488 -6131 Founded: 1991 www.dflt.org The Desert Foothills Land Trust was established to protect and preserve the unique and s ensitive land areas of the Sonoran desert foothills containing the Carefree, Cave Creek, New River and far North Scottsdale communities. As a non -profit, volunteer organization, the Trust protects land through gift, purchase, bequest, and conservation eas ement for the edification and enjoyment of current and future generations. The Trust works to ensure the survival of the unique plant and wildlife of the fragile Sonoran desert. Diablo Trust PO Diablo Trust, a not -for-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation, is an Arizona Land Management Team and National Reinventing Government Laboratory. Covering 426,000 acres of mixed ownership property, the Trust began in 1993 when two long -time Arizona ranches, the Bar -T-Bar and the Flying M Ranch, asked people for ideas to assist them in the protection of open spaces and healthy habitats. Today the Trust provides a forum for the comm unity to actively participate in a land stewardship process. Additionally, the ranch lands provide \"hands -on\" proving grounds for new, collaborative land management ideas. 36 Grand Canyon Trust -Flagstaff - Headquarters 2601 N.

Eligibility Criteria for Forest Legacy Areas According to the FLP Implementation guidelines, \" Eligibility Criteria are a set of factors developed by the State lead agency, in consultation with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee (S FSCC), to evaluate geographic areas to determine if they contain significant environmental values to be considered an 'important forest area' and contain 'threats' of conversion to be eligible as a Forest Legacy Area\" (USDA 2003a, p. 4). In accordance with these guidelines, TNC, in conjunction with the AFSC, clarified several definitions used in the FLP guidelines in order to tailor the program to Arizona's forest needs. The first definition is what constitutes a fores t (for definition see Section I, Forest Legacy Program in Arizona). The last two definitions deal with defining 'threats' of conversion as well as 'important forest areas' for private forest land. Threatened forests are defined as any forest at risk of con version to non -forest use by roads and/or human developments. Important forests are defined as those forests that include one or more of the following values: o Riparian areas o Fish and wildlife habitat and corridors o Known threatened and endangered species o Timber, and other forest commodities o Scenic resources o Public recreation opportunities o Known cultural resources o Other ecological values. II. Arizona's Forest Legacy Areas Using the above definitions of forest, threatened forest, and important forest, along with map layers showing areas with high environmental values, public values and development threats we propose three Forest Legacy Areas (FLA) for Arizona. The selection of these FLAs take into account that there are extensive areas of the state, that are not suitable by virtue of their ownership or their ecological condition. For example, Indian reservations and trust lands are protected through the trust relationship bet ween the U.S. Department of Interior and the tribe. The extensive heart of the Sonoran Desert in southwestern Arizona is largely in public ownership or is within an Indian reservation or does not meet other criteria and thus is not included. The three For est Legacy Areas proposed are the Arizona Strip, Arizona Highlands and Sky Islands. Arizona Strip: This FLA includes pinyon -juniper woodlands that are part of the larger, intact natural landscape of the Colorado Plateau. It is generally defined as the area north of the Grand Canyon National Park and the Kaibab National Forest, and west of the Navajo Indian Reservation. Subunits of the FLA are Mohave and Coconino counties. 42 Arizona Highlands: This FLA covers the most extensively forested region of the state. It includes the ponderosa pine forests of the Mogollon Plateau, the mixed conifer and high elevation riparian systems of the White Mountains, the forested mountains of west -central Arizona, and important riparian forests along central Arizona rivers such a s the Verde, Salt, Little Colorado, Blue and Bill Williams. Forest types include conifer, pinyon juniper and riparian. The area is roughly bounded on the north by the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, Grand Canyon Nationa l Park and the Navajo Indian Reservation and on the south by La Paz County, Maricopa, Pinal and Gila Counties. Private lands within the Tonto National Forest, and the southern portion of Apache Sitgreaves National Forest are included. Subunits of this FLA Yavapai, Apache and Greenlee counties. Sky Islands: Southeast Arizona is characterized by basin and range topography and it contains some of the state's most diverse forest habitats including mixed conifer, pin yon juniper, madrean oak woodlands and riparian. Its proximity to subtropical Mexican forests accounts for the area's high biological diversity, with many forest species reaching their northernmost limits. Important riparian forest systems include the San Pedro, Santa Cruz, and Gila Rivers and many of their tributaries and headwater areas. The FLA includes the eastern portions of Pinal and Pima counties, Gila County south of Tonto National Forest, Graham County south of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservat ion, Greenlee County south of the Apache/Sitgreaves national Forest, and all of Santa Cruz County and Cochise County. Within these three areas, all private forestlands that meet the four basic eligibility criteria are eligible for FLP participation. Indivi dual proposals for protecting properties with FLP funding would be ranked according to the Forest Value and Threat Criteria Prioritization Process (Table 2). A. Projec t Eligibility Criteria A proposed projects eligibility to be included in the FLP include the minimum requirements below: It is within, or partially within, a designated FLA; The pa rcel must be private or tribal non -trust allotment land and at least 5 acre s in size ; It has a minimum of 75 percent forestland or a documented plan that includes sufficient landowner capacity to reforest to at least 75 percent forestland; It can be managed consistent with the purpose for which it was acquired by the FLP; The lan downer is willing to sell or donate the interest in perpetuity and acknowledges that the conservation easement will be held by a government entity if Federal funds are used for the acquisition ; The landowner must be a willing participant and agree to have a Landowner Forest Stewardship Plan (LFSP) written for the property ; The pa rcel must be an environmentally important forest area and must be threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. Once a project is judged to be eligible it will be scored and ranked i n accordance with the criteria and weighting factors summarized in the evaluation form that follows. Six overarching criteria were selected 43 for use in the prioritization process for evaluating competing FLP projects. The criteria listed in priority order a re: Ecological and Environmental values, Site viability and importance to other forestlands, Threat immediacy, Contribution to larger conservation strategy, Public values, Local support and presence of partners and/or matching funding. The criteria can be ranked by assessing a variety of factors that contribute to each of the criteria. These factors are found in the Forest Value and Threat Criteria Prioritization Process table (Table 2). Table 2. Forest Value and Threat Criteria Prio ritization Process Forest Value Criteria Weight (3,2,1) Score (1-5) Weighted Score (Weight x Score) Conversion Threat Criteria Weight (3,2,1) Score (1-5) Weighted Score (Weight x Score) Riparian Forest Example 3 4 12 Riparian Forest 3 Immediacy 3 Forest Condition 2 Road Impact 1 Threatened, Endangered, Rare, Sensitive Species 3 Housing Density 2 Critical Habitat 2 Subdivision Platted Contribution to other Conservation Program 2 Censu Block Change 2 Protected Area Inholding 2 Property for Sale 3 Watershed/Aquifer Recharge 3 Total Threat of Conversion 11 Movement Corridor 2 Total Environment and Ecological Values 19 Large Block (>100 ac.) 3 Proximity of Protected Land (>1,000 ac.) 2 Readiness 3 Time Limitations 2 Affordability (Per acre Cost) 2 Total Site Visibility Value 12 Local Support 3 Matching Funds 3 Other Conservation Planning or Partners 3 Total Project Support 9 Scenic 2 Recreation 2 Cultural 2 Economic 2 Total Public Values 8 Total Weighted Score 44 Weighting factors are rated 1, 2, and 3 with 3 being the highest priority. Weighting totals reflect the relative importance of each of the evaluation categories. For example, the environmental and ecological value total weight of 19 gives the highest of the six categories. The weighting factors given above are provision al and may be modified as they are tested. Where spatial data layers are available, criteria will be mapped in FLAs and compounded in a composite map that shows areas with a color coding system. For example properties that lie in a designated conservation area which also incorporates public values are reflected in the colorcoding of the FLA maps, as are those forests that lie in TNC conservation areas. Some map layers are not at present incorporated into the composite maps but these may be developed as the program matures and the rating criteria adjusted to reflect this improved knowledge. Criteria lacking in spatial data layers will be evaluated according to guidelines developed by the Forest Stewardship Committee as part of the individual project evaluatio n process. Weightings will be reviewed and revised as necessary by the Forest Stewardship Committee. For example, critical habitat designations for threatened or endangered species are evolving as new species are listed or designations take place. Likewise the presence or absence of threatened, endangered or sensitive species on a property may also be fluid and open to new information being brought to the ranking process. To assess a particular property's over -all ranking for FLP funding, priority will be given to areas of high forest value first regardless of the degree of threat. Threat criteria will play a secondary role in assessing over -all project ranking as illustrated by the following matrix: High Value High Threat Priority 1 High Threat Low Value Priority 3 High Value Low Threat Priority 2 Low Value Low Threat Priority 4 Environmental and Ecological Factors Environmental or ecological factors to be assessed about a proposal include: presence of riparian forest; forest condition; presence of threatened, endangered or sensitive species; critical habitat designated for listed species; designated conservation are a; watershed or aquifer recharge area or wildlife movement corridor. Priority will be given to riparian forest and examples of other high quality forest types. Forest values also include the presence of priority wildlife such as threatened, endangered, sen sitive, and species of concern as well as designated critical habitat for listed species. The presence of wildlife movement corridors where documented is also a significant value. Other special attributes that would influence 45 ranking include forestlands ov erlying water supply aquifers or contribution to watershed conditions. Building upon previous conservation planning efforts will be advantageous thus, giving higher priority to those projects that are within a pre -existing local, regional, or global conser vation plan. Examples include: at a 48 local scale, areas that fall within the Pima County Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan; at a regional scale, areas within The Nature Conservancy's ecoregionally based portfolio of conservation areas; and at a global sca le areas within the globally recognized biodiversity hotspot of the Madrean Archipelago. The viability and importance of the site to other forest lands Large blocks of land have higher ecological integrity due to their ability to maintain ecosystem level processes such as hydrologic cycling and natural fire regimes. They can also offer greater social and economic benefits due to their size. For these reasons, priority will be given to those private parcels that add to existing protected lands, such as count y parks, state parks, national forests, national parks, wilderness areas, and/or other public land managed for natural resources. Likewise, priority will be given to properties which grouped together become a large intact forest block compared to smaller i solated parcels of forest land. Local support and presence of partners and/or matching funding (Project Support) With Arizona's increasing population and the recent boom in ex -urban development there are many areas of private forest at risk of development . Given the limited funds of the FLP, it is important to leverage funds and encourage support offered through local partnerships. To this end, higher priority will be ascribed to those projects that demonstrate local support and/or provide matching funds. Immediacy of threats to the site (Threat Immediacy) The immediacy of road and development threat to a site is a key factor in determining overall priority level. Areas that are under imminent threat of development and possess high ecological, public, or economic values will receive higher priority. However, ecological value can decrease while the threat (and cost) of private forestland increases with increasing proximity to existing developments. Thus, it is important to give priority to projects with high ecological, public, or economic value that can be protected within the timeline of the FLP process. Such projects should be carefully evaluated to determine the feasibility of success. This strategy provides protection to properties with the greatest ecolo gical, public, and economic value at the lowest price. Public values Public values include scenic and recreational benefits provided by the site, as well as the presence of cultural resources such as archaeological or historic sites. The importance of the private forest to the local economy through local timber harvest, ranching, and traditional forest uses is also a public value. B. Goals and Objectives of Arizona's FLP The main goals for the Arizona FLP are (1) protect important private forest from conversion to non -forest uses through development and ex -urban growth; (2) maintain the ecological integrity of Arizona's forests 46 with the purpose to protect watershed functio ns for instance ground water recharge, as well as protect native plant and wildlife habitat; and (3) maintain forest integrity in order to protect cultural and public values within the forests in addition to economic values associated with traditional fore st uses such as timber harvest, livestock ranching, and recreational opportunities. To reach these goals several program objectives have been identified: o Reduce forest fragmentation through protection of ecologically and publicly important private forest l and by focusing on large forested blocks o Maintain watershed functions and protect water supply by protecting forests in the upper watersheds, along ephemeral streams, around springs, and the entire length of perennial reaches o Protect wide ranging, rare, t hreatened, and/or endangered plant and wildlife habitat o Protect important historical and cultural sites o Promote forest stewardship through working together with private, federal, and state land managers to achieve these goals III. Assessment of Need Infor mation Gathering Processing A. Spatial Information and Analysis To aide the prioritization process for identifying environmentally important forests at risk of non -forest conversion, three spatially explicit data sets were used to identify areas of high p ublic and ecological value as well as areas of road and development threats within private forest lands. These data sets were a result of spatial analyses using a Geographic Information System (ArcView 3.3). The forest types were delineated using GAP veget ation (1998) and riparian vegetation information from the Arizona Game an d Fish Department (AZGFD 1994) . Land ownership information was acquired from the Arizona Land Resource Information System (Figure 8, ALRIS 1998). The public value spatial layer was i ntended to evaluate private forestlands in context of values that the general public may place on public lands and cultural resources. The two key components of public value are described as (1) presence of or proximity to areas with cultural and historica l sites and (2) proximity to public recreation opportunities. Cultural importance was based on information from the Arizona State Museum, which identified acres of cultural resources by township/section map units. Areas within 8 km of public land with recr eation opportunities (i.e., parks, wilderness areas, National Forests, and BLM land) were also defined as having public value. The combination of culturally and recreationally important areas within private forestlands is referred to as public values and i s shown. The environmental value spatial information was based on over six years of planning effort by The Nature Conservancy to identify areas for conservation in Arizona. The network of conservation areas in each of the five ecoregions that converge in Arizona identify and represent the diversity of species, communities, and ecological systems within an ecoregion including but not limited to forest resources. The conservation 47 portfolio was created to capture the context of threatened, endangered, and co mmon species locations and habitat requirements (including wildlife corridors), as well as to evaluate their importance to ecological functioning of an area, and overall biodiversity of the region. This spatial data was then used to select and display private forest holdings that occur within the portfolio of conservation sites. Thus the supporting mapping does not display the conservation portfolio per se but identifies private forests that occur within the portfolio. The development threat spatial lay er shows areas that have been heavily impacted by human development. This spatial layer was a combination of 1) road impacts, based on road size (i.e., interstate, dirt road) and their ecological impacts (Theobold 2003, Figure 8); 2) estimated current hous ing density, based on aerial photography (from 1994 to present) from which areas with structures were identified as rural, mixed, or urban. [Mike Fisher, with the Bureau of Land Management, created this digital information to assist land management agencie s in natural resource planning.]; 3) Mohave County assessor data (Mohave County GIS Department); 4) Coconino County subdivision data (Coconino County GIS Department); and 5) Pima County assessor data (Pima County GIS Department). Table 3. Description of road buffer widths used in the Threats of Development layer Road Description Total Buffer Width (m) Primary: limited access or interstate highway 1000 Primary: other U.S. or State highway 500 Secondary: state and county 200 Local 200 Vehicular: four -wheel drive 30 Given that the information used to create the public, ecological, and threat spatial layers was obtained from various sources using a variety of survey methods, were collected and recorded using different spatial scales, with unknown accuracy, it was important to field verify those aspects of the data that were feasible. To this end, a sample of private forest lands were visited to check the accuracy of GAP vegetation and Arizona Game and Fish Department riparian v egetation. In addition, housing density was assessed and its relationship to biotic integrity was qualitatively determined. Other spatial data analyzed and incorporated in the Assessment of Need included locations (skewed up to five miles) of threatened, e ndangered, and sensitive species and other species of special concern on private forest lands. This information was provided by the Arizona Game and Fish Department and under agreement will remain confidential. Exact species locations and maps of these spe cies are not provided in the AON. The Arizona Forest Health program, a collaborative project of the US Forest Service and University of Arizona Cooperative Extension, provided spatial data of insect damage to Arizona's forests. 48 B. Field Validation Field v erification was conducted for two weeks in April 2004, and was targeted to areas where public value , ecological value , and development threat intersected. Over the course of our trips, approximately 2,400 miles, 25 conservation areas, 7 National Forests, a nd 18 riparian areas were visited along with several representatives from each of the four forest types and the different types of development threats. Regarding the vegetation spatial information, observations from the field assessment suggest the followi ng: mixed conifer forests were identified accurately most often, with pinyon -juniper woodlands fairly accurate as well. The accuracy of riparian forests was highly variable, either riparian forests were not identified or they were misidentified as another vegetation type. With additional information such as presence of perennial water or native fish used in conjunction with the vegetation layer, the accuracy of identifying riparian forests increased substantially. Finally, Madrean oak woodlands appeared to be the least well identified vegetation community, often misidentified as mesquite or unidentified all together. Field observations of the development threats revealed this layer to be fairly accurate in terms of properly identifying housing density and ro ad size. Assessment of the impact of the housing density on biotic integrity suggested that areas with mixed or urban housing density are too heavily impacted in their present state to be of significant conservation value. Either singularly or in combinati on, rural housing density or road impacted areas still had relatively intact forest communities. We also noted that rural areas near booming communities appeared to be at the highest risk for development. Based on field validation and observations, maps c ontained within the AON should be used as a general guide for assisting in prioritizing private forest lands, public values, ecological values, and development threats, not a definitive map of their locations. Recommendations for priorities are as follows: Riparian forest along perennial water represents a small proportion of the total forest in Arizona, yet a disproportionately high number of species depend on them. Riparian forests are some of the most biologically diverse and rich communities in Arizona. Given their dwindling extent and high value, these areas should be the top priority. Areas classified as having rural housing density or only road impact near Kingman, Prescott, Chino Valley, Flagstaff, Heber to Show Low along Highway 260, Sonoita, Elgin, and Green Valley should be prioritized for Forest Legacy Program funds due to their imminent conversion by development. 49 IV. Arizona's Forest Legacy Area Descriptions Each FLA is summarized as follows: a general description of the area with key land ma nagers and rivers identified; a brief description of the vegetation communities contained within the FLA; a list of species with special status on private forest lands; discussion of the ecological and public values; and a tally of acres threatened by deve lopment. Each FLA description also contains an overview of the growth and development patterns within the particular FLA. All of the tables and figures presented in this section are courtesy of the Sonoran Institute's Economic Profile System (Sonoran Insti tute 2000). The descriptive information for each county was adapted from the Arizona Department of Commerce county profiles (2003). Finally, there is a description of the Forest Legacy Program priority goals and objectives for each FLA. The goals and objec tives are not intended to be an exhaustive list but rather they represent items in need of conservation based upon spatial analyses and field assessments. During the development of the Assessment of Need, the contractor worked in conjunction with the ASLD, the AFSC, the US Forest Service and others. The public review process and comments are provided in further detail and outlined in Section 3; see Public Review and Comments. While the ecological and public values vary for each FLA, the strategies for prote ction and conservation are the same for all counties. They are as follows: 1) Implementation of a conservation easement program that focuses on protecting priority forest land. 2) Leverage other funding sources for forest land protection and conservation easemen ts. 3) Hold forest land conservation easement conference in an effort to identify conservation partners, become aware of priorities of other organizations and individuals, and to build upon on -going forest land protection efforts. 4) Establish conservation part nerships in order to facilitate easement acquisition. 5) Develop site specific forest stewardship plans. Similarly, the public benefits derived from identifying these FLAs are also the same for each FLA and they are as follows: 1) Protection of watershed and wa ter quality and quantity for human use. 2) Protection of valuable plant and wildlife habitat. 3) Protection of traditional forest uses (timber harvest, livestock ranching, and recreation) and cultures. 4) Protection of scenic landscapes and aesthetics. 5) Reduction of wildland -urban interface issues 50 A. Arizona Strip Forest Legacy Area The Arizona Strip FLA consists of the portions of Mohave and Coconino counties located north of Grand Canyon National Park, Lake Mead National Recreation Area and Kaibab National Forest. The predominant forest and woodland ownership in the Arizona Strip is Bureau of Land Management land with 1,158,313 acres followed by Arizona state trust lands with 71,210 acres and then by privately owned land with 59,651 acres. Vegetation Pattern s Vegetation within the Arizona Strip FLA is a mixture of Mohave Desert scrub on its western edge, Great Basin grasslands bordering the pinyon -juniper woodlands that occur over much of the areas. The pinyon - juniper woodlands cover about 1,276,912 acres in the FLA with 1,145,839 acres occurring on Bureau of Land Management. There are approximately 71,125 acres of pinyon -juniper on Arizona State trust lands and 58,706 acres on private land. About 7,572 acres of mixed conifer forest and 4,902 acres of riparian forest occur on Bureau of Land Management. On private lands there is about 935 acres of riparian forest. Ecological and public values are associated with the extensive area of BLM Forestland and the private forest inholdings. These areas are used for recr eation and also support other public values such as cultural resources. There is a concentration of ecological values associated with the Virgin River riparian area and also in the north central portion of the FLA. See Map 5. Appendix E provides complete information on occurrences of federally listed species, sensitive species and species of concern by county. Growth and Development Patterns The Arizona Strip is separated from the remainder of the state by the Grand Canyon and is remote. Population growth that is occurring in Mohave County and in Coconino County is occurring around the population centers of Kingman, Flagstaff and Sedona with little growth pressure occurring in most of the Arizona Strip FLA. A growth corridor and pressure for development doe s exist along the I -15 corridor and the Virgin River between St. George and Las Vegas. The locations of private forests also coincide with increased levels of road construction and these areas also have public values due to their proximity and integration with public lands. See Map 6. For a more complete discussion of Coconino and Mohave county resource values and demographics please see Appendix I which contains information on forest resources, land tenure, threats assessment for all Arizona Counties. Goal and Objectives 1) Protect riparian forest values along the Virgin River and associated use by riparian obligate species such as the federally listed Southwestern Willow Flycatcher and native fish species. 2) Protect traditional forest uses, recreational and ran ching uses by focusing attention on privately owned pinyon -juniper woodlands in the north central portion of the FLA. 3) Prevent fragmentation of public pinyon -juniper woodlands and creation of WUI issues by protecting private woodlands from unplanned develop ment. 51 Figure 12. Arizona Stip Forest Legacy Area B. Arizona Highlands Forest Legacy Area General Description The Arizona Highlands FLA encompasses a swath that traverses the central highlands of Arizona from Nevada to New Mexico . It captures portions of the Arizona -New Mexico Mountains, Colorado Plateau, Apache Highlands and the Mohave Desert ecoregions. Elevations range from 482 feet at Lake Havasu City, Arizona on the Colorado River in western Mohave County to 12,643 feet at Hu mphrey's Peak north of Flagstaff in Coconino County. The FLA consists of the Mohave County south of Grand Canyon National Park; all of Yavapai County; Coconino County south of Grand Canyon National Park; northeastern portions of Maricopa and Pinal Coun ties; Gila County, except for its extreme southern corner; Navajo County located south of the Navajo Indian Reservation and North of the White Mountains Apache Indian Reservation; Apache County south of the Navajo Indian Reservation; and that portion of Gr eenlee County that contains the Apache/Sitgreaves National Forest. The predominant ownership in the Arizona Highlands FLA is Federal with Bureau of Land Management ownership totaling 3,426,572 acres most of which is located in Mohave County. USDA Forest Se rvice ownership totaling 8,846,457 acres in Yavapai County, southern Coconino County, western Gila County, 52 eastern Maricopa County, the southern parts of Apache and Navajo Counties and all of Greenlee County in the FLA. The remaining portion of the FLA is a mix of state trust lands with 3,776,256 acres and private lands with 6,382,323 acres. The state trust lands and private lands often occur in a checkerboard pattern and thus their fates are closely related. Vegetation Patterns The extreme variations of altitude, precipitation, soil types and terrain contribute to exceptional diversity and interspersion of habitat types. In general, the pattern follows elevation zones with Mohave desert scrub in the low western portion of the FLA ranging up through Great Basin grasslands as elevation increases moving to the east. As elevations continue to increase the pinyon -juniper woodlands become predominant. Moving further to the east in Yavapai County and western Coconino County the vegetation types shift to chaparral in the southern lower elevations with a transition to Great Basin grasslands and then to pinyon -juniper woodlands and finally mixed conifer forests as elevation increases. This same pattern continues across southern Coconino, Navajo and Apache Counties. T he mixed conifer forest being the predominant forest type with fringes of pinyon -juniper woodlands to the north grading out into Great Basin grasslands along the I 40 corridor and north into the Navajo Reservation. There are a total of 10,382,804 forested acres in the Arizona Highlands FLA. Federal, state and local agencies own and manage 7,886,239 acres and 2,480,878 acres are in private ownership. There are a total of 3,030,794 acres of mixed conifer forest, 123,543 acres of madrean oak woodland, 7,005,53 6 acres of pinyon -juniper woodland and 222,931 acres of riparian forest. Private lands contain 134,434 acres or 4.4% of the mixed conifer, 16,937 acres or 13.7% of the madrean oak woodland, 2,254,401 or 32% the pinyon -juniper woodlands and 75,106 acres or 33.7% of the riparian forest. Interspersed with the upland deserts, grasslands and forests are the major rivers of the Arizona Highlands and their tributary streams. These include the Bill Williams and Santa Maria rivers in Southern Mohave County, Verde River, Salt River, Black, Blue, White, Little Colorado and Aqua Fria Rivers as well as their numerous tributaries. These rivers support extensive riparian forests and these are of exceptional value due to the great diversity of wildlife that depend on riparian forests in Arizona. The forests of the Arizona Highlands FLA support raptors such as Mexican spotted owl, American peregrine falcon, ferruginous hawk, northern goshawk, osprey, American bald eagle, and black hawk. Southwestern willow flycatcher , Yuma clapper rail is federally listed endangered riparian obligate species and Western yellow -billed cuckoo is a candidate species for listing. Aquatic species include the federally listed razorback sucker, Gila topminnow, loach minnow and spikedace, as well as lowland and Chiricahua leopard frogs. Growth and Development Patterns The Arizona Highlands contains some of the most rapidly growing areas in the state. Since 1970 Mohave and Yavapai counties have grown by 130 thousand or 494% and 131 thousand or 350% respectively. Although some of the growth in Mohave County occurred in the Arizona Strip FLA along the I -15 corridor, most occurred in the vicinity of Kingman and Bullhead City. These growth rates for Mohave and Yavapai 53 counties exceeded that of the state average growth rate. During the same period Coconino County grew by 67 thousand or 137% and Navajo County grew by 50 thousand or 103%. Although this rate of growth was slower than the state average it exceeded the national average. Apache County grew by 36 thousand, a 111% increase and Gila County by 21 thousand, a 74% increase during the period. Although Maricopa and Pinal counties were very rapidly growing counties the portions of these counties that lie within the Arizona Highlands are predominantl y within the Tonto National Forest. Greenlee County is the only county that lost population since 1970, losing approximately 1,900 people or 18% of its population. Within the FLA, growth is occurring around Kingman and Bullhead City in the west, around P rescott, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley and Paulden and along the Highway 69 corridor between Cordes Junction and Prescott in Yavapai County. In Coconino county growth is focused around Flagstaff and adjacent to the boundaries of the Coconino National Fores t. Sedona is also a growth center. In the eastern portion of the FLA the greatest growth is occurring in the White Mountain communities of Heber, Showlow, Pinetop - Lakeside, Greer, and Springerville. These areas are experiencing boom conditions for real est ate sales and values and are popular spots for retirement and recreational second homes. It is paradoxical that while the White Mountains area is considered in this document to be a high priority for program attention, land exchange proponents are seeking the disposition of national forestland for development purposes through land exchanges adjacent to communities such as Showlow. Throughout much of the Arizona Highlands the rapid pace of development and the pattern of development are contributing to a seri ous and growing set of wildland -urban interface issues. Flagstaff and the White Mountain Communities are essentially large growing inholdings within the National Forests and their vulnerability to fire is increasingly obvious every fire season. The propose d Forest Legacy Program can be used to offset this vulnerability to some extent by providing protected private areas as a buffer between the public forest and developed cities, towns and residential areas. Another disturbing pattern of development is becom ing common in the Arizona Highlands Forest Legacy Area. That is the rapid conversion of large ranches to forty -acre subdivisions. This has become a favored development strategy by land investors and speculators because it requires a minimal investment in development infrastructure and long term involvement in the outcomes of the development. The value of the initial investment increases substantially due to the reduction of parcel size with a related increase in per acre value. This type of speculation also takes advantage of the checkerboard pattern of state trust land and private land that exists across most of the Arizona Highlands. Arizona law allows each of the forty -acre parcels to be split five times without application of any subdivision requirements . The land use pattern being created on the private lands thus will contribute to a growing crisis in wildland -urban interface management conflicts. This development pattern carried to its logical end will restrict management through the use of natural pro cesses, such as fire on much of the 1,421,977 acres of state trust forests and woodlands in the FLA. Goals and Objectives 1. Protect private riparian forests and associated public values such as recreation, watershed and aquifer functions, and ecological valu es such as breeding bird and native fish habitat and other 54 wildlife use along perennial and near perennial streams. Of particular significance are the Bill Williams and its tributaries, the Verde River and its tributaries, Salt River and tributaries and th e Little Colorado and its tributaries. 2. Reduce fragmentation of publicly owned pinyon -juniper forests and retain management options by protecting private forests that are interspersed throughout the FLA. 3. Sustain traditional pinyon -juniper forest uses such a s gathering of firewood, fence posts, and pinyon nuts, as well as hunting, birdwatching and other recreational uses by protecting the vast pinyon -juniper woodlands that occur throughout much of the FLA. 4. Reduce fragmentation of the National Forests by prote cting private inholdings and private forests located in areas adjacent to National Forest boundaries through the use of conservation easements. 5. Manage wildland -urban interface issues by protecting key private forestlands from development adjacent to Nation al Forest boundaries. 6. Maintain the highest quality natural areas by protecting private forest and woodlands within Nature Conservancy designated conservation areas. 7. Maintain wildlife movement corridors between the mixed conifer forest of the high elevation s, across the mid elevation pinyon -juniper to large functional grassland units by focusing attention on undeveloped private lands along known wildlife corridors. 55 Figure 13. Arizona Highlands Forest Legacy Area C. Sky Islands For est Legacy Area General Description The Sky Islands FLA consists of the southeastern portion of Pinal County; the eastern half of Pima county; all of Santa Cruz county and Cochise County; as well as the extreme southern corner of Gila County; Graham County south of the San Carlos Apache Reservation; and Greenlee County south of the Apache/Sitgreaves National Forest. The FLA contains the Coronado National Forest, which occurs as eleven distinct districts, which total 1,647,324 acres. Bureau of Land Managemen t holdings are concentrated in a band across the northern edge of the FLA although scattered holdings occur elsewhere such as along the San Pedro River and east of the San Pedro River. BLM holdings total 1,831,745 acres within the Sky Islands FLA. The Ariz ona State Land Department is the largest landowner and manager in the FLA with 4,055,529 acres and private lands comprise the second largest ownership at 3,656,575 acres. Vegetation Patterns The Sky Islands FLA contains portions of two ecoregions. The Son oran Desert Ecoregion covers the western half of the FLA and the Apache Highlands covers the eastern half of the area. The Sonoran Desert transitions into the semi -desert grasslands and madrean oak woodlands of the Apache highlands as elevations increase t o the south and east. At the higher elevations of the Sky Islands, mixed conifer forests grade up into spruce -fir forest on mountain peaks. The mixed conifer forest transitions to madrean oak woodland as elevation drops. The forested mountains and foothil ls are connected across the basins by semi -desert grasslands or Sonoran desert scrub at lower elevations. The basin bottoms are traversed by streams such as the San Pedro and Santa Cruz Rivers that flow from southeast to the northwest where they join with the Gila River that runs from east to west along the northern edge of the Sky Islands FLA. Associated with these rivers are the cottonwood willow riparian gallery forests and the mesquite bosques (forests) that cover the riparian terraces along many of the stream systems. Forested areas within the FLA total 1,377,458 acres or about 37.7% of the total area of the FLA. Mixed conifer comprises 137,515 acres of which 2,727 acres are in private ownership. Madrean oak woodland is the most extensive forest type wi th 1,114,908 acres of which 99,637 acres or about 8.9 % in private ownership. Pinyon -juniper is the least extensive with 29,814 acres in total of which 7,727 acres or about 25.9% in private ownership. Riparian forest comprises 95,221 acres of which 46,038 or about 48% in private ownership. Much of the Sky Islands FLA is part of a greater geographical region referred to as the Madrean Archipelago which was recently added to Conservation International's list of the world's hotspots for biological diversity (Andrew Smith personal communication). The mixed conifer forests are vital habitat for animals such as the Mount Graham red squirrel and Pinaleno Mountain snail. This FLA's forestlands are home to a large array of species ranging from the endangered 56 to the M exican spotted owl to the Southwestern willow flycatcher. Several species of bats and hummingbirds migrate through this area while some animals, like the tropical kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus) and jaguar reach their northern limits in these forests. Fe derally listed endangered plant species such Kearney's blue star and Huachuca water umber (Lilaeopsis schaffneriana, var. recurvata) are also found here. The riparian gallery forests along perennial water or near perennial stream reach es are vital to a large number of aquatic species such as the Sonoran and desert suckers, Apache trout the Chir icahua and lowland leopard frogs. These forests are vital as habitat for many riparian obligate bird species such as the federally listed endangered southwestern willow flycatcher as well as a host of other riparian obligate birds such as the Western yello w-billed cuckoo, yellow warbler, summer tanager, black hawk, gray hawk, and zone -tailed hawk. In Pinal County there are 61 species that are threatened, endangered, sensitive or of special concern. In Cochise county there are 153 species that are threatened , endangered, sensitive or of special concern. Santa Cruz County has 121 species that are threatened, endangered, sensitive or of special concern. In Pima County there are 99 species that are threatened, endangered, sensitive or of special concern. Likewis e in Greenlee County there are 44 species at risk or of concern, Graham County has 69 such species and Pinal County there are 61 species at risk or of concern. Ecological and public values are concentrated around the riparian areas and at the North end of the Chiricahua Mountains and in eastern Greenlee County associated with the Gila River and the San Francisco River. There is also a cluster of ecological and public values private forest that occurs on the West side of the Mule Mountains in the Upper San P edro basin. Growth and Development Patterns Growth in the Sky Islands FLA is of special concern due to the increasing effects of population expansion on scarce water resources and their related effects on stream and riparian systems. Growth has been increa sing around population centers such as Tucson, Benson, Sierra Vista and Casa Grande. Large master planned developments arise on the landscape seemingly overnight and create satellite communities that become growth centers on their own and displace native f orest and woodlands. Although an enormous amount of growth has occurred and still continues in the desert lands around Tucson there is an increasing amount of suburban development in the higher elevations of Southeast Arizona. This growth is being fueled b y the economic factors such as Fort Huachuca in the San Pedro Basin (the largest single employer in Southern Arizona) and by the favorable climate that is drawing retirees in increasing numbers. The highest value lands and the most desirable lands for deve lopment are the madrean oak woodlands that surround the protected Sky Islands. In the Sky Islands FLA the Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Gila rivers and their tributaries are greatly threatened or impacted to some degree by urbanization. Most of the Santa Cruz River downstream of Santa Cruz County was lost as a fully functioning system from the 1940's. It is now essentially a dry riverbed with the 57 remaining riparian values throughout the reach in Pima and Pinal counties dependent on the discharges of effluent f rom Pima County's wastewater treatment plant. In Santa Cruz County the Santa Cruz River retains its riparian forest in the headwaters in the San Rafael Valley because the valley has been spared development thusfar. In the reach downstream of Nogales to Tub ac effluent discharges from the International Wastewater Treatment plant just north of the Mexico Border contribute significant flows to the river. The upper San Pedro River in Cochise County is under threat from rapid urbanization in the Sierra Vista subw atershed. The lower San Pedro in northern Cochise County, Pima and Pinal counties has been substantially impacted by excessive water use related to agricultural irrigation and mining withdrawals. In the San Pedro River basin, programs are underway to prote ct groundwater and surface flows and considerable progress has been made in protecting riparian forestlands through acquisition of fee title ownership and conservation easements by Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, The Nature Conservancy, P ima County and others. However, much work remains to be done. Goals and Objectives 1. Prevent fragmentation of riparian corridors and protect to the greatest extent possible riparian and aquatic wildlife habitat. 2. Protect wildlife movement corridors between th e mixed conifer forests in Forest Service hands through the privately owned madrean oak woodlands to protect the forest connections with the grasslands and riparian forests. 3. Protect aquifer recharge areas and important watersheds through the use of conserv ation easements to limit development on private forestlands. SECTION 3 Project Development Process The Arizona Forest Legacy program is proposed to be implemented following the eight step process described in the Project Development Process that follows. Arizona Forest Legacy Program Project Development Process Step 1: Distribute Request for Proposals (RFP) ............................................ ................................ January 15th A request will be put out to land trusts, county & municipal governments, and other interested parties announcing the program, providing general information including eligibility criteria, and publicizing the application deadline of May 1st. Step 2: Application Period ........................... ......................................... ..................... January 15th to April 15th Applications will be accepted throughout this period. Preliminary assessment of eligibility may be done during this time as a prerequisite to the project evaluation period. 58 Step 3: Project Application Review & Evaluation ......... ................................ ............. April 15th to May 15th The Forest Legacy Sub committee of the Arizona Forest Stewardship Committee (AFSC) will review, rate, and rank applications during this time. Their findings and recommendations will then be presented to the AFSC for consideration and approval action. Step 4: AFSC Application R eview & Prioritization ......... .................................................. May 15th to June 1st The AFSC will consider the findings and recommendations of the Forest Legacy Subcommittee, and take action to approve, disapprove, or table applications. Afinal ranking of projects will be made at this meeting. Step 5: Notification of Applicants ........................... .......................................... ................. June 1st to June 15th Applicants will be notified of the status of their project applications. Top -ranked applicants will be encouraged to \"partner up\" with a conservation organization to assist in the gathering of baseline information for their parcel, and to begin due diligence work. Step 6: Obtain Landowner Options ............ ........................................ .................. August 1st to September 1st The state FLP Coordinator will work to obtain an option(s) from the highest ranked one-to-three applicants. Granting of an option by the landowner will be a determining factor in final selection for submission to the Forest Legacy Information System (FLIS) . Step 7: State Project Prioritization & Submission ................................ ...September 1st to September 15th Following the collection of additional information on parcel characteristics, eligibility, and the resolution of landowner options, the AFSC will do a final prioritization of up to three (3) parcels for entry into the (FLIS). Step 8: Submission of Application(s) to USFS Region ................................... ....October 1st to October 15th One-to-three priority applications are forwarded to the Southwestern Regional Office of the USDA Forest Service for funding consideration. Landowner(s) whose applications have been forwarded to the Forest Service will be notified and subsequently kept informed. Section 4 Public Review and Comments The public review process consisted of a detailed review by the Arizona State Forest Stewardship Committee (AFSC), as well as several other formal and informal outreach and communication venues. The primary vehicle for review was through the AFSC which is composed of 25 members representing the following entities: Arizona Association of Conservation Districts, Arizona Cooperative Extension, Arizona Department of Agriculture, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, Arizona Department of Transportation, Arizona Game and Fish Department, Arizona State L and Department, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Four Corners Sustainable Forests Partnership, The Nature Conservancy, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Northern Arizona University, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Sierra Club, University of Arizona, USDA Farm Services Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and private land owners. AFSC's role is to function in a supporting and advisory capacity, 59 providing assistance and recommendations to the State Forester regarding the development, implementation, monitoring, and updating of the Forestland Enhancement Program State Priority Plan and the State Forest Stewardship Plan. Similarly, the AFSC acted in an advisory capacity, providing recommendations and support during the A ON development and commenting on earlier drafts of the AON. There are many benefits in using the AFSC as the primary sounding board for the AON process; one is that the diversity of committee members representing various affiliations provides an opportunit y to reach an even broader audience. The represented organizations each have a unique set of clientele and networking avenues. As a AFSC member, each participant represents a constituency and acts on their behalf. It was through these existing channels of communication and framework that the AON and the FLP was presented to an extensive audience. More specifically, on March 24th 2004 the AFSC was presented with information about the Forest Legacy Program and the Assessment of Need to be developed for Arizona. Some of the presentation and discussion topics included: the eligibility criteria, FLA boundaries, project evaluation crit eria, and the spatial data sets used to be used in generating information for the AON. Committee members provided valuable feedback that was considered during the AON development process and incorporated into the AON. One such comment resulted in a more li beral definition of forest lands. Other suggestions included comments on the project evaluation criteria such as maintenance of wildlife corridors, identifying critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, and weighting traditional uses more high ly in the project selection criteria process. Earlier drafts of the AON were made available to all members of the AFSC and comments were received from four members. In general, the comments were editorial in nature with requests for clarification on some timber statistics and historical information. There were no incongruities with the approach, direction, or tone of the document. The AFSC feedback was carefully considered and as appropriate, incorporated into the final AON document. Other outreach activi ties included contacting the Region 3 Forest Service Public Affairs Media Officer to create awareness that Arizona would be participating in the FLP in the near future. To this end each of the six National Forest supervisors and seven of the Forest Service land resource personnel in Arizona were contacted to provide input on environmentally important private forests that were contained within or adjacent to the Forest boundaries (Appendix G). Responses were received from the Tonto and Apache - Sitgreaves Nati onal Forests. This information was incorporated into the FLA within which they occurred. Other regional Forest Service personnel also provided comments and suggestions. Informal public outreach also occurred with many different agencies and organizations d uring the course of compiling information and preparing the AON. Through conversations, agencies and organizations were informed about the FLP in Arizona. The following are some of the entities contacted: the Arizona Department of Commerce, Arizona Game an d Fish Department, various divisions in the State Land Department such as Land Information, Title and Transfer and Natural Resources, Trust for Public Land, Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona Cooperative Extension's Arizona Forest Health Program, National Park Service Rivers, Trails & Conservation Assistance, Sonoran Institute, and Bureau of Land Management. The Nature Conservancy's Arizona chapter featured an article about the upcoming Forest 60 Legacy Program in their donor newsletter (distributed t o 3,300 members) and in their spring newsletter (distributed to 25,000 members). See Appendix H as an example of one such article. While an appropriate public outreach effort was undertaken, continual efforts will be engaged to disseminate and receive inf ormation to and from the public. The hope that the Forest Legacy Program is just the beginning of a positive dialogue with all agencies, organization, and individuals interested in forest land in Arizona. 61 Literature Cit ed Abert, J.W. 1848a.

Letter sent to Arizona National Forest supervisors, sent via email March 12, 200 4 Dear Forest Supervisor: The Arizona State Land Department has expressed interested in participating in the federal Forest Legacy Program (FLP). The FLP was established in 1990 by the U.S. Forest Service to protect environmentally sensitive forestlands. This federal program partne rs the Forest Service with the state lead agency [Arizona State Land Department] to provide funding to states to assist them in securing conservation easements on private forestlands threatened with conversion to non -forest uses. There are currently 33 sta tes and territories active in the FLP and the 2003 budget appropriations were $68 million, earmarked for 43 projects. This entirely voluntary program was designed to encourage the protection of privately owned forestlands. For more information visit the FL P web site at: http://www.fs.fed.us/spf/coop/programs/loa/flp.shtml To participate in the FLP, a state needs to develop an Assessment of Need (AON) in consultation with the State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committee. The Nature Conservancy was awarded the contract to prepare the Arizona Assessment of Need by the Arizona State Land Department. The AON must document the State's need for a Forest Legacy Program, establish eligibility criteria, set guidelines, and identify priority areas for protection. Su ch areas must, at a minimum, meet the following criteria: Environmentally important forest areas, which include areas important for scenic, recreational, riparian, ecological, cultural, or traditional forest uses, and be Threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. Due to the short time frame of this project (30 June 2004), we are requesting your assistance to identify priority forestlands. Specifically, we are interested in learning about existing in -holdings and adjacent forestlands that are currently threatened by conversion to non -forest uses. We are also interested in information regarding whether conservation easements already exist or if the USFS is planning on purchasing certain parcels; such information would be helpful in our analysis. Any infor mation you could share would be appreciated, however, spatially explicit information would be most useful. We hope to have this information gathered by the end of March so we can include is information in the Assessment of Need. Please feel free to contact us. We will follow - up this email with a phone call during the week of March 29th. Thank you for your assistance in the Forest Legacy Program. Sincerely, The Nature Conservancy, Arizona Chapter Heather Schussman, Fire Science Specialist, 520 -622-3861 x3440 "}
