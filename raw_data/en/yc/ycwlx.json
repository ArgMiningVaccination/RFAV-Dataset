A key component of making better decisions is having the right information - ideally a pathogen diagnosis for every case, and high quality, accessible cow records. You will discuss how to obtain information, interrupt what it means, and how to do the best you can with what you've got. Topics will include treatment protocol design, antibiotic selection for pathogen-based and blanket treatment, treatment duration, treatment failure and alternative management strategies for cows that don't get antibiotics. You will also touch on selective dry cow therapy as the next frontier in antibiotic stewardship. Attendees will select one of the following working groups and submit a draft protocol to work through with the group: - Pathogen-based treatment of mild/moderate clinical mastitis - Blanket treatment of mild/moderate clinical mastitis - Selective dry cow therapy In addition, each group will work through a series of case scenarios, thinking about how their protocols would be applied or adapted to fit the scenario. Working groups will submit a list of key take-aways or important considerations on protocol design, to be shared later with the entire group. Pre-webinar work Listen to Episode 59 and Episode 60-Clinical Mastitis Treatment with DVM, to discuss treatment of non-severe clinical mastitis, best practices for producers, how to apply her research in the field and her mastitis celebrity status.

Participants will learn from one another about different approaches, successes, and failures, and develop key take-aways to share with larger group. 3:00-3:10 pm-Break 3:10-3:40 pm-Using DC305 to Make Better Decisions Having the right information at the right time is critical to making the right decisions about mastitis therapy.
