Financial Po licy The state's financial policy, contrasting the relationships between expenditures and revenues from all sources that are estimated for the ensuing fiscal year with the corresponding figures for the latest completed fiscal year and the fiscal year in pro gress; and a budget summary; 2. State Appropriations and Taxes, Excluding Dedicated Funds Appropriations and tax estimates from general state tax sources, excluding appropriations from dedicated tax sources; this is the so-called \"State Taxpayers Budget\"; 3. Detailed Budget Estimates Estimates of expenditures and revenues, including all funding sources; program statements and performance measures; statement of the state's bonded indebtedness, detailing redemption requirements until retirement, the net and gross debt of the state, and condition of the sinking fund; and 4. Appropriations Bill and Other Budget Bills The General Appropriations Bill, whereby the General Assembly gives legal sanction to the financial plan it adopts. Upon passage, this bill appropriates by agency and fund the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. The revenues by which these expend itures are financed also are d etailed in this bill. In addition, other bills required to give legal sanction to the financial plan must be filed.Parts one, two, and three are included in the Budget Document. The format of the Budget Document is reviewed annually for clarity and content. Part four, the Appropriations Bill and other budget legislation, such as the Bond Authorization Bill, are separate documents. The first section of the Budget Document, entitled \"Budget Overview,\" is a brief summary of the total budget. The roles of the various branches of government in the budget process are described in \"The Budget Process\" narrative, located near the end of the \"Budget Overview\" section. The General A ssembly, or Legislative Branch, makes the laws; the Judicial Branch interprets these laws; while the Executive Branch, headed by the Governor, has the Co nstitutional duty to administer and execute d uties and functions that have been enacted into law by the General A ssembly. The \"Budget Process\" explanation is followed by a subsection entitled \"Basis of Budgeting and Accounting,\" which explains how the Budget is presented and some of the mysteries of accounting. Following this preface is a series of charts and schedules that summarize the Budget. The total state budget and the General Fund budget are represented by pie charts that detail each major tax and each functional area for the recommended budget. Tennessee's current tax structure has the majority of its tax revenue coming from the sales tax, the largest portion of which funds educ ation. The overview schedules clarify and detail the e xpenditures, revenue sources, and personnel requirements of state government. A new chart, following the pie charts and two total state budget charts, explains base budget reductions from discretionary state appropriations. This is a departmental summary of the General Fund impact of the base reductions; a separate budget document supplement volume explains the reductions byThe Budget Document program. The discretionary appropriations exclude appropriations from dedicated taxes that are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific programs (explained in the \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section.) Discretionary appropriations also exclude certain programs held harmless because of the nature of the program or because of state or federal requirements, such as the Basic Education Program, mental retardation programs, most of the Families First program, most of children's services, and most of the TennCare (or Medicaid) program. There are several total budget schedules comparing pr ograms by funding source and showing how those funds are derived. In these comparison charts, the 2003-2004 estimates for the Cities and Counties Fund (state-shared taxes) and Department of Transportation appropriations reflect a recommended base budget reduction, with the funds being redirected to the General Fund. Therefore, the 2003-2004 Cities and Counties Fund and Department of Transportation appropriations are lower than the tax estimates for the Cities and Counties Fund and Highway Fund in the \"State Revenues\" tax distribution charts. Also included are tables that list, by department, the improv ements proposed for the next fiscal year. There are two charts that provide the total fund ba lance available, indicating the appropriation requirements and the General Fund and Education Fund revenues and reserves available to meet that need. These two charts are titled \"General Fund and Education Fund, Comparison of Appropriation Requirements and State Revenues\" for the current year and next (or recommended budget) year. These charts show how the budget is balanced against General Fund and Education Fund tax revenues for the two fiscal years. Due to its unique funding source, the Department of Transportation is highlighted separately with its detailed funding requir ements. All agencies and departments are included in the summary comparison schedules by program and funding source. Other schedules provide detail on the supplemental appropriations required to maintain programs in the current fiscal year, the Constitutional spending limitation requirement, and a su mmary of personnel and funding for all state agencies and higher education instit utions. Following the \"Budget Overview\" summary schedules is a statement of the Administration's priorities, followed by a history of major programs. A \"Tennessee Characteristics\" section includes demographic and physical statistics on the state. The \"Economic Overview\" narrative discusses the relative trends and impacts of Tennessee's economy on state revenues. The Budget Document also includes an historical analysis of the effect on the state budget of federal aid trends and fe derally mandated costs. The section entitled \"State Tax Revenues\" lists the various sources of revenue, the collecting agencies, and the statutory appo rtionment among the various funds: the General Fund, Education Fund, Highway Fund, Sinking (or Debt Service) Fund, and Cities and Counties Fund. A comparison of collections by fiscal year is presented on the remaining pages of that section. Included in the \"Financial Statements\" section are the comparative balance sheets for the General Fund, Education Fund, and Highway Fund as of June 30 for the two prior years. This schedule is followed by the expenditures and requirements of the Debt Service Fund for the previous, current, and subsequent fiscal years. A Debt Service Fund comparative balance sheet also is included. The status of the various authorized and unissued bonds is given in a schedule of bonds and appropriations made for capital purposes in lieu of bond issuance. The statement of bonded indebtedness pre sents the retirement schedule for the state's bonded debt. The cost of outstanding bonds is reflected as principal and interest. The proposed capital outlay for the ensuing fiscal year is included within the \"Capital Outlay Program\" section. Specific projects are shown for each departmentThe Budget Document impacted, with the statewide capital maintenance effort included among the items for the Department of Finance and Administration. Whether from current funds of the general fund, the sale of general obligation bonds, or from other sources, the proposed funding for each project is indicated. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds, federal revenues, and other departmental revenues; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. Except for the \"State Taxpayers Budget\" and a chart summarizing base budget reductions from a discretionary base, all of the other summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document that deal with appropriations include appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees. The major portion of the Budget Document is \"Program Statements by Functional Area.\" For presentation in the Budget Document, departments and agencies with related missions, programs, goals, and objectives are grouped, resulting in sixfunctional areas. This enables legislators, policy-makers, and citizens to have a be tter concept of the magnitude and costs of services provided through the various functional areas of state government. At the beginning of each functional presentation is an introduction to the associated agencies, followed by a list of the improv ement items that are recommended for that area of state government. The improvement list is followed by tables that show the total expenditures, fun ding sources, and personnel of each functional area. The activities and responsibilities of the departments and agencies are explained through narrative descriptions of each program. Following this narrative, fiscal and personnel data are provided for the last completed year, the current year, and the next year. The next-year estimates include the level of funding and number of positions for the recommended base budget, program improvements, and the total recommended. At the end of each functional area program statement is a table of performance measures and program information, covering the three years for which funding is displayed. The final section of the document provides a glossary of terms and an index to permit easy reference to specific departments or pr ograms.Summary Statements and ChartsTotal State Budget Where Your State Tax Dollar Comes From Gasoline Taxes 9\u00a2Motor Vehicle 3\u00a2Sales Tax 59\u00a2 Insurance & Banking 4\u00a2 Franchise & Excise 11\u00a2 Gross Receipts & Privilege 5\u00a2 Income & Inheritance 2\u00a2All Other Taxes 5\u00a2Tobacco, Beer, & Alcoholic Beverages 2\u00a2 Where Your State Tax Dollar Goes Business & Economic Development 1\u00a2 Cities & Counties 7\u00a2Resources & Regulation 3\u00a2Education 40\u00a2 Health & Social Services 31\u00a2 General Government 2\u00a2Law, Safety & Correction 9\u00a2Transportation 7\u00a2 Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004General Fund Budget Where Your State Tax Dollar Comes From Franchise & Excise 11\u00a2Insurance & Banking 5\u00a2All Other Taxes 6\u00a2Tobacco, Beer & Alcoholic Beverages 2\u00a2 Sales Tax 68\u00a2 Income & Inheritance 3\u00a2Gross Receipts & Privilege 5\u00a2 Where Your State Tax Dollar Goes General Government 2\u00a2Health & Social Services 36\u00a2Business & Economic Development 1\u00a2Education 47\u00a2 Resources & Regulation 3\u00a2 Law, Safety & Correction 11\u00a2 Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004Actual Estimated Recommended Act. vs. Est.

In developing a balanced budget amidst these challenging and unpleasant realities, fiscal priorities are based on four basic criteria. Balance a budget without raising taxes. Invest in the future of Tennessee by protecting K-12 education. Ensure that state government continues to provide core, essential services. Increase efficiency and seize the opportunity to show that we can do more with less. A balanced budget is a good start, but it is just a beginning. This budget reflects the sacrifices by Tennesseans who understand that we need to make tough choices and hard decisions to address this budget crisis. In the months and years ahead, together with the General Assembly and the people of Tennessee, this Administration can achieve significant progress in the areas of education, economic opportunity, the environment, children's issues, safe and healthy communities and a more responsive and responsible government. A few of these priorities which the Administration has begun to address are: Balanced Budget - Governor Bredesen believes it is his responsibility as Governor to introduce a balanced budget. In doing so, Governor Bredesen will continue to apply a hands-on approach to management and to allow a more open approach to the budget process. Ethics in Government - Citizens should feel confident in their government and assured that public officials will approach their jobs in a highly ethical manner. In signing his first Executive Orders, Governor Bredesen created new ethics policies for Executive Branch appointees that verify conflicts of interests and disclose outside sources of income, hold department commissioners accountable by requiring them to certify the ethical conduct of their departments, and establish an ethics committee to serve as a watchdog entity over the Executive Branch. Protecting Education and Addressing Teacher Pay - K-12 education is an investment in Tennessee's future. Governor Bredesen will continue to protect the full funding of the Basic Education Program. In addition, $26.7 million is recommended in this budget as the first step in addressing the Tennessee Supreme Court ruling. Governor Bredesen also formalized a Task Force on Teacher Pay to recommend a comprehensive solution to teacher salary equity and overall teacher pay. Jobs Cabinet - Governor Bredesen believes creating more and better job opportunities is a key to improving life in Tennessee. Tennessee must diversify in order to compete in a rapidly changing economy. The creation of the Jobs Cabinet will coordinate efforts at the highest levels of state government to create better-paying, higher-skilled jobs for working Tennesseans. Children - Every child deserves to grow up healthy and happy. Governor Bredesen wants the state to work with families, agencies and foster parents to help protect children. Governor Bredesen is committed to creating a Children's Cabinet to encourage better cooperation between agencies responsible for children's welfare. Statewide Imagination Library Initiative - Governor Bredesen wants to ensure that every child reads at grade level by the end of the third grade. Successful early childhood reading initiatives have been proven to make a significant impact on a child's ability to learn. Governor Bredesen is committed to expanding Dolly Parton's Imagination Library program statewide through a public-private partnership. This program allows every child from birth to the start of kindergarten to receive a book per month. Safety and Homeland Security - Safe communities are vital to the health and well being of all Tennesseans. Governor Bredesen is proposing the elimination of the statute of limitations for rape and sex crimes committed against children. Governor Bredesen also understands that homeland security must be our first priority and has elevated the Office of Homeland Security to be treated as a cabinet-level post. TennCare - TennCare is a good initiative that must be fundamentally fixed. It is crucial to get TennCare back on track while still ensuring that people who need appropriate medical coverage receive it. Addressing eligibility, aligning benefits with the state's ability to pay, and toughening regulation of managed care organizations will all be critical reform efforts necessary for the survival of the program.Tennessee Program History Children Children's Services Social services to children are consolidated in the Department of Children's Services. The department's goals are to: Provide appropriate care for children in custody close to home and return them to their families or provide for permanency of care in a timely manner; Work with communities to provide prevention and intervention services to protect children, strengthen families and supervise youthful offenders; Increase community involvement, local decision-making and accountability for funding and services; and Create an effective management and delivery system to ensure services are provided in a timely and cost effective manner. Improvement of Health and Behavioral Health Services \u2014 The Department of Children's Services (DCS) wants all children in custody to have timely medical and dental screenings and appropriate medical treatment; this EPSDT (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment) is part of the medical intervention given to all children entering custody. EPSDT screenings are the \"gateway\" to preventive careand referrals for appropriate care and treatment. The department added regional health units comprised of a Children's Services TennCare representative, a nurse practitioner or nurse, and a part-time psychologist. In addition, a medical services director was hired. Between January 1999 and June 2002, EPSDT completion rates improved from 50% to 94%, and dental screenings increased from 43% to 87%. Review of Foster Care and Adoption Programs \u2014 The Department of Children's Services worked closely with the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) in an extensive review of Tennessee's foster care and adoption programs. CWLA helped the department to assess the current status of these programs and to develop strategies for change based upon the review. Based on recommendations by the CWLA, legislation was passed and implemented to improve services to children in foster care. CWLA developed a three-year plan to help the department implement the results of the review. The CWLA plan is completely funded in the current year. Additional funds are recommended in 2003-2004 to continue child welfare improvements, addressing issues settled by the state and plaintiffs in the Brain A . lawsuit agreement. System-wide reform efforts were underway when Children's Rights, Inc., in May 2000, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of children in foster care and adoption services in Tennessee. The department participated in a mediation process with the plaintiffs' attorneys and signed the Brian A. settlement agreement in July 2001, which is guiding the department through a four and one-half year reform plan. The settlement agreement stipulates outcomes and performance indicators that must be met for successful resolution of the lawsuit. It appointed an independent monitor to assess the department's compliance with required actions and meeting of performance levels. In addition, it created a five member Technical Advisory Committee, funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, to advise DCS on child welfare policy, management, and practice issues. Funds were provided in FY 2002- 2003 to reduce foster care caseloads and were provided in 2002-2003 and are recommended in 2003-2004 to decrease supervisor-to-case manager ratios for units managing custodial cases, meet increases in demand for adoption assistance, and enhance permanent custodial placement through the creation of Permanency Support units in each region. Twelve educational specialists and 12 educational attorneys were hired to represent and advocate for educational resources for children in custody or at risk of entering custody. Plans were formulated for children in less intensive facilities and group homes to be reintroduced into local school system settings. Additional resources were also provided to expand efforts to recruit new foster and adoptive homes. The department expanded its Training division to provide enhanced pre-service training to all new staff and improved in-service training to all continuing staff and supervisors. The division began providing pre-service training for case managers in their own regions, rather than centrally, in order to accommodate staff more easily and to provide training more efficiently. DCS created an internal Quality Assurance division to work closely with the Brian A. monitor in evaluating the effectiveness of casework practice and systemic improvements. A Compliance division was developed to ensure compliance with the settlement agreement by coordinating the department's improvements with the monitor, Technical Advisory Committee and the plaintiffs' attorneys.Increased Focus on Adoption \u2014 Critical to the department's mission, and a major goal, is the timeliness of achieving a child's permanency through adoption. The department has a strong mandate to move children to permanency more quickly, whether that is return of the child to his or her natural home or to an adoptive placement. In order to improve the current adoption system, the department is working closely with providers, the courts, and child advocates to expand recruitment of adoptive homes and to remove legal and administrative barriers that have hampered adoptive placements. This strategy will help to increase the number of adoptive placements and to shorten the time children are in state custody. Between FY 1998-1999 and FY 2001-2002 the number of annual finalized adoptions completed increased from 382 to 922. More Concentration on Independent Living \u2014 The department provides independent living services to all foster care youth, ages 14 and above. An Independent Living assessment is conducted on all youth beginning at the age of 14 to assist in planning to meet individual needs, and independent living goals are addressed on all permanency plans for youth from that age. These services are designed to give youth the necessary skills to become productive citizens. Youth are taught skills to assist them in employment, decision-making, problem solving, housing, transportation, education, literacy, and knowledge of community resources. Youths may also continue to receive support, including Independent Living services on a voluntary basis, past age 18 years and up to 21 years, if they are in custody on their 18th birthday and if they are participating in an educational or job training plan. Youths who age out of care at 18 and elect no longer to receive services voluntarily are able to receive periodic assistance and support from the department. Each of the 12 geographic regions of the department has an Independent Living consultant provided through a contract with the University of Tennessee College of Social Work, Office of Research and Public Service.These consultants work directly with youths in Independent Living Skills development groups. The consultants also work with educational resources to meet individual needs, as well as are developing community-based resources and networking with communities to highlight and to meet the needs of the communities' youths. These consultants have direct contact with DCS and agency staff to assist them in developing skills and awareness to meet the range of needs of youth in care. The implementation of the federal 1999 Chafee Foster Care Independence Act has increased the funds available to assist youths leaving care and has increased the focus on meeting the needs of this significant population of children in custody in Tennessee. Improving Child Abuse Prevention and Detection \u2014 All newly employed Child Protective Services staff and selected law enforcement child protection investigative team members have received training in advanced investigation techniques. The department has strengthened its ability to assist local efforts through the stationing of Child Protective Services staff in Child Advocacy Centers in Sullivan, Hamilton, Montgomery, Knox, Davidson, Robertson, Lawrence, Madison, Tipton, Henderson, and Shelby counties. The department has worked with the General Assembly to pass legislation establishing seven forensic child interviewer positions located in Child Advocacy Centers in each grand division of the state. The department received funds to complete implementation of a centralized intake system for receiving and responding to child abuse reports in the FY 2002-2003 budget. Implementing the Family Support Services Program \u2014 One goal of the Department of Children's Services is to provide community prevention and intervention services to keep our children and communities safe. To achieve this goal, DCS has developed a non-custodial Family Support Services (FSS) program. The community-based FSS program provides targeted case management and purchased services to families and children to prevent orsolve problems that would ultimately result in the child being placed in the custody of the state. The FSS program allows clients access to a full continuum of services without going from agency to agency. The Family Support Services program was expanded statewide in FY 2001- 2002 and is expected to serve over 2,900 children and their families. Continuing the Successful Family Crisis Intervention Program (FCIP) \u2014 The Family Crisis Intervention Program (FCIP) serves unruly children who have committed an offense that would not be illegal for an adult; this child could be a truant, a runaway, or be beyond the control of the parent. By law, if the department is unsuccessful in helping the family resolve their issues with the child, this program may certify to the court that further intervention is warranted, including, but not limited to, commitment to state custody. The FCIP program relies on crisis intervention techniques to help families resolve their issues with the child. Services are short term, typically 30 days or less. FCIP received over 7,000 referrals in FY 2001-2002 with a success rate of 96% in preventing the breakup of families and the placement of children into state custody. TN KIDS Information Management System \u2014 Tennessee has implemented a new child welfare information management system called TN KIDS. This system provides front line case managers, supervisors and management with the information and tools to retrieve data and information essential to tracking, managing, and planning services for all children under our care. In order to assure the availability of information needed by staff, TN KIDS has been developed with extensive input and involvement of all levels of departmental staff. Eligibility determination, contracts, and fiscal modules are being developed and added to the system. Outcome-Based Contracting \u2014 The Department of Children's Services has improved contracting with service providers by focusing on desired outcomes. All agencies under contract with the department now haveoutcome measures for tracking success, services, and the matching of contract agency activities with the goals of the Department of Children's Services. By reporting and tracking outcome expectations, providers and the department can evaluate programs, impact of services, and coordinate needs and goals. Juvenile Facilities \u2014 Specialized treatment programs are being developed to address treatment needs of youth committed to the department's four secure youth development centers. A violent offender program was implemented at Taft Youth Development Center. Sexual offender treatment programs are being implemented in each of the four youthdevelopment centers. Alcohol and drug treatment programs will also be enhanced. Relative Caregiver Program \u2014 As the result of legislation passed by the Tennessee General Assembly, a two-year pilot Relative Caregiver Program was started in FY 2000-2001. This program developed out of recognition that abused or neglected children, or children whose parents are unable to provide for them, are best served if cared for by other suitable family members instead of being placed in foster care with unrelated caregivers. The pilot program was established in three sites covering 16 counties. The pilot was extended for two additional years in the FY 2002-2003 budget. Educ ation K-12 Education In 1992, the state made a significant commitment to improve K-12 public education. The funding formula established by the 1992 Education Improvement Act is called the B asic Education Program (BEP). The BEP provides funds to local school systems based on their student membership and costs of certain educational components shared with the community's relative ability to fund education. Educational components are divided into two categories: classroom and non-classroom. Classroom components include items such as teachers, instructional equipment, supplies and materials, and textbooks. Non-classroom components include such items as transportation, superintendents, construction, and maintenance and operations. Classroom components are funded 75% by the state and non-classroom components are funded 50% by the state. Since 1991-92, over $1.3 billion in new recurring funds will have been invested in the BEP as of 2003-2004. The proposed 2003-2004 budget recommends an additional $26.7 million for teacher salary equalization. In the past, the State has provided $12.3 million in recurring funds for teacher salary equalization. The totalrecommended in this budget for salary equalization is $39 million. The new $26.7 million addresses the Constitutional issue decided by the Tennessee Supreme Court. This will provide initial funding to the lowest paying local education agencies, raising all local education systems to a minimum $37,000 teacher salary average. An estimated 17,161 teachers in 75 school systems will receive a salary increase. $5.9 million of these funds will be dedicated to holding harmless those school systems not receiving additional teacher salary equalization funds under this appropriation. According to the Department of Education's 21st Century Schools Report Card, between 1991-92 and 2001-2002, average expenditures per student grew from $3,732 to $6,349, an i ncrease of 70%. St udent enrollment in Tennessee's schools has grown by 8.7% in the same time period. Higher EducationOperating Expenditures per Student $3,732$6,066$6,349 1991-1992 2000-2001 2001-2002 Fiscal Year Higher Education Tennessee is competing against other states in the Southeast and the nation that have recognized the importance of a quality higher education system. In regional and national comparisons, Tennessee's colleges and universities do not rank among the top tier schools. The quality of the faculty and the facilities must be raised to higher levels, and a commitment must be made to increasing educational attainment of the citizens of Tennessee. The state must encourage more people to earn a post-secondary degree. Only 19.6 percent of Tennesseans over the age of 25 have a college degree, compared with the national average of 24.4 percent and the southern average of 22.4 percent. A college education is important to the individual, as well as society, because of the difference in income realized through education. According to 2000 census data, a person with a bachelor's degree has an average annual income of $51,644, compared with $27,975 for a person with a high school diploma. The difference in income will result in financial benefits to society through increased spending in the economy and through increased revenues to the state. Additionally, a better educated workforce will help in recruiting industry, as companies require highly skilled workers who can be used in today's high-tech economy. Spending on higher education can be viewed as an investment with solid returns to the individual, the business community, and the state. Although funds have not been available to implement many of the recommendations of the 1999 report of the Council on Excellence in Higher Education, the goals suggested in the report remain sound. As the state budget picture improves in the future, higher education needs of Tennesseans should be addressed. According to the 1999 report of the council, Tennessee has few students with high SAT scores who apply to in-state universities. That report raised concerns that Tennessee's brightest students do not see the higher education opportunity in our statethat they desire. Were it not for our private colleges and universities, Tennessee would be a net exporter of college-bound students. In its report, the Council on Excellence in Higher Education presented a blueprint for making Tennessee's public higher education system among the nations very best. The report included five broad recommendations to improve the state's higher education system: Define and adopt a modern system-wide mission; Establish goals and performance targets in keeping with the mission; Authorize the Tennessee Higher Education Commission to ensure that programs, institutions, and operating components are aligned with the goals; Strategically increase funding and link allocated revenues to performance goals; and Enhance governing authority and reorganize the governing board appointment process. While acknowledging the goals of the Council on Excellence in Higher Education, one also can recognize many of the common-sense recommendations of the later plan of action suggested by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC). Given the austere funding situation and the limited prospect for additional support in the near future, higher education cannot continue to operate on the basis of business as usual. While the goal of providing access for all Tennesseans remains constant, the responsibility remains to provide the highest quality educational product to the taxpayers of Tennessee. The THEC plan of action attempts to balance this tension and provides assurance that institutions will continue to offer the highest quality education possible, while constantly seeking to operateefficiently and making the best use of technology. The plan of action represents an effort on behalf of Tennessee higher education to address a variety of policy concerns, given conditions of fiscal austerity. The following policy options represent several of the core components of the plan: The development of specific enrollment ranges for funding purposes at the four- year institutions; Increased admissions standards for universities; Removal of state appropriations for remedial coursework and a reduction in appropriations for developmental instruction at the state's four-year institutions; Creation of a more stringent review process for new academic programs; Limiting expenditures of student fees and state appropriations for intercollegiate athletics; Revision of the funding formula; Termination of several associates programs at the university level; and Implementation of a variety of initiatives that will allow higher education to better serve its accountability mission. Economic Opportunity Economic Development Leading companies from around the world are discovering the advantages of doing business in Tennessee. With our prime geographic location, skilled workforce, outstanding transportation network and pro-business environment, Tennessee has earned a solid reputation as a premier business location. From the automotive industry to technology development, to printing and publishing, to warehousing and distribution, our diverse business base speaks volumes as to the wealth of economic and lifestyle advantages and opportunities that, quite simply, help companies build better products more efficiently in Tennessee. Tennessee's bright business climate, along with quality of life and cultural diversity, offers companies more options than ever. According to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Tennessee is ranked among the top ten states in the nation for number of jobs linked to foreign investment and ranked eleventh in the nation in manufacturing jobs. Tennessee is the employment leader in automotive manufacturing in the Southeast region with 16,200 employees, which represents 30 percent of the Southeast region's total automotive manufacturing employees. Tennessee remains committed to enhancing community quality of life and increasing family income by creating better-paying, higher-skilled job opportunities with a future. The state engages in the following activities to accomplish these goals:Tennessee Business Services \u2014 Tennessee Business Services (TBS) provides the assistance communities and employers need to attract, maintain, and increase jobs in Tennessee. TBS works with a network of organizations statewide to help assure the success of existing business and to encourage their expansion. Business development activities include: A statewide manufacturing resource network to help manufacturers solve problems and become more competitive through the Manufacturing Means Jobs initiative; Offering engineering, technical and training assistance to manufacturers through the Tennessee Manufacturing Extension Partnership; Small Business Services works to assure the success of small businesses statewide through its small business information guide and assistance programs; The department partners with the Tennessee Small Business Development Center network to provide entrepreneurs and small business owners with easily accessible counselors in 14 center locations statewide to assist them in starting and growing their small businesses; and The Office of Minority Business Enterprise facilitates the resources needed in assisting minority businesses in growth and business development. Marketing & Recruiting \u2014 Enhancing Tennessee's image as a premier business location is the primary focus of the marketing team. International business promotion and recruitment are emphasized, as well as strategic conferencing and direct target marketing to high-growth industries and companies. Additional activities include: Providing prospects with a general or prospect-specific packet with information on taxes, transportation systems, labor statistics and environmental regulations; Recommending available facilities or industrial sites to prospects; International recruitment; and The Tennessee Industrial Infrastructure Program (TIIP) works with communities and regions to provide industrial infrastructure support on issues like water, sewer and rail sidings. TIIP serves as an incentive in the process of encouraging private sector firms to locate or expand their financial investments in Tennessee. Community Development \u2014 Community Development works with Tennessee communities to prepare and compete for economic development and to improve community quality of life. The Three-Star Program helps communities take full advantage of economic development opportunities, preserve existing employment, create new jobs and increase family income. The Energy Division promotes economic growth by helping businesses and government organizations improve energy efficiency. The Local Planning Assistance program provides technical assistance to help local governments strengthen their planning and community development efforts. Tourist Development \u2014 The travel and tourism industry is an important factor in Tennessee's economy. Domestic and international travelers to Tennessee annually spend nearly $10.4 billion. As a result of spending by travelers, tourism provides jobs for over 176,000 Tennesseans, and tax revenues for state and local governments totaling over $855 million.Approximately 35.7 million people visited Tennessee in 2002, making Tennessee one of the nation's most popular destinations. Because of the jobs and tax revenues produced by tourism, national and regional competition for tourism continues to be high. In order to increase its share of tourist dollars, Tennessee must aggressively market and promote the state's assets. Some of the Department of Tourist Development's marketing programs include national broadcast and print advertising campaigns and direct sales programs targeted at group tour companies, travel agents, and inte rnational tour operators. In addition, the department makes co-op advertising projects available to the tourism industry, develops rural and heritage tourism opportunities through promotion programs, promotes Tennessee to the media and national travel press, and develops Tennessee publications which are distributed to customers. The department also operates the state's 13 welcome centers, which provide literature, information and reservations to the millions of travelers who visit Te nnessee. Families First Families First is Tennessee's version of the federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. The program emphasizes personal responsibi lity, work requirements, time limits for assistance, and education and job training. Families First also provides its participants child care, transportation, increased coordination with child support enforcement, and transitional benefits. Personal Responsibility \u2014 The foundation of Families First rests on the individualized Personal Responsibility Plan. This plan, developed between the participant and the caseworker, ou tlines the steps towards self- reliance: Failure to participate in work activities and reach the goals specified in the plan can r educe or eliminate benefits; Teen parents must stay in school and live at home with parents or anotherresponsible adult; and Parents must ensure all eligible children attend school, infants and youth must be immunized, and children's health checks must be current. Work Requirements \u2014 Work builds self-esteem and independence from welfare assistance. While working, participants will also gain experience for greater responsibilities and career advancement: Non-exempt participants will be required to work or engage in work-related trai ning or education 40 hours a week; Those who are unable to find a job must engage in employment or career counseling, community service, or job readiness classes. Education and Job Training \u2014 While many Families First participants currently have some combination of education and work experience, many need job training classes to enhance their employability: Education and job-related training counts as part of a participant's 40-hour work requirement; Participants testing below a 9th grade functional literacy level can enroll in 20 hours a week of adult basic education and be e xempted from additional work and time limits until they reach the 9th grade level. Support Services \u2014 Certain support services are provided to those individuals who work or participate in education, employment training, counseling, or treatment services. These services include: Transportation (including a First Wheels Vehicle interest free loan for qualified individuals); Child Care; Dental and Optical Assistance; Uniforms and other clothes needed for work or training; and Other supportive services necessary for work or training. Time Limited Benefits \u2014 Limits on benefits have been established as a means of encoura ging participants to work towards self- sufficiency. Benefits for non-exempt participants are limited to 18 months at any one time, which may not be consecutive, and to five years over the course of a lifetime. Exemptions to this requirement include disabled caregivers; caregivers ages 60 and over; caregivers assisting disabled family members; families who do not have an adult included in the grant amount; individuals functioning under 9th grade level who attend basic education classes; and parents who are not able to secure child care, transportation, or training that is needed to comply with Families First. Family Services Counseling \u2014 Individuals who have significant barriers to obtaining employment may qualify for family services counseling assessments and services while on cash assistance and for 12 months after leaving the program. These services cover: Mental Health issues; Drug and alcohol problems; Learning disabilities; Domestic violence issues; and Children's health and behavior issues. Transitional Benefits \u2014 In order for families to sustain self-sufficiency, many benefits will be extended beyond the period of cash assistance. Availability of these benefits can be up to 18 months after full employment begins and can include: Child care; Transitional Medicaid; Food Stamps; Family Services counseling; First Wheels vehicle loans; and Transportation. Child Support Enforcement \u2014 Many of the families enrolled in Families First would not need assistance if child su pport payments were made. Families First expects partic ipants to: Identify the father of dependent children; Help find the absent parent and establish paternity. In addition to these efforts, Tennessee has also passed the license revocation law, implemented the Tennessee Child Support Enforcement Computer System (TCSES), and utilized the internet in location of delinquent parents. Child Care \u2014 The Department of Human Services' initiatives in child care have focused on three central issues: quality, affordability, and availability. The \"Star-Quality\" system includes the annual mandatory and voluntary rated licensing programs for licensed child care agencies. Centers, group, and family child care homes are evaluated on a number of quality measures and may receive 1, 2, or 3 star ratings indicating higher levels of quality achieved. The Tennessee Early Childhood Training Alliance (TECTA) is a statewide education and training service offered throughout Tennessee Board of Regents institutions. No- or low- cost training is available to child care providers to assist them in meeting licensing standards and further enhancing their professional development. Infant and Toddler Model Sites is an initiative to develop family homes and centers around the state as models for training and for applying a nationally- recognized program for enhancing the development of infants and toddlers. The department continues to support over 56,000 child enrollments monthly for low- income, working families through its Child Care Certificate (Subsidy) Program. Reimbursement rates to participating providers are based on prevailing market rates. Program Outcomes \u2014 The average monthly welfare caseload for FY 2001-2002 was 63,156 families, down by 28,343 cases (from 91,499 in August, 1996). As of December 2002, Families First participants were involved in the following activ ities: Employed 13.3% Adult Education 8.6% Work preparation or Job skill training 42.1% Exempt caretaker 21.2% Child only care 25.9% Family Service Counseling 5.2% While some families will continue to experience personal and financial setbacks which require assistance, Families First helps ensure that their need is temporary and that families quickly return to st ability and self- reliance. Public Health TennCare On July 1, 2002, Tennessee reached a new five-year agreement with the federal government to continue TennCare, which began in 1994. The two primary TennCare products are TennCare Medicaid and TennCare Standard. TennCare Medicaid is a continuation of the federal Medicaid program. TennCare Standard is similar to a commercial HMO package and is available to certain low-income uninsured persons and medically eligible citizens. TennCare Partners \u2014 In July 1996, mental health services were merged into a managed care system called TennCare Partners. This new system utilizes two behavioral health organizations ( BHOs) to manage mental health services similar to the TennCare MCOs. They serve all enrollees of the TennCare Program and the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities priority population. These services include: Psychiatric and substance abuse inpatient treatment; Outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment; Psychiatric pharmacy services; Transportation to covered mental health services; and Other specialized mental health treatment, such as case management and crisis services. Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities \u2014 The Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities is currently implementing a major initiative called the Creating Homes Initiative. Through thisinitiative the department is working to create safe, affordable, appropriate, and quality housing for Tennesseans with mental illness. This initiative is built on partnership with key Tennessee community leaders representing consumer, family member, mental health, community social service provider, landlord, realtor, faith-based, nonprofit, bank, government, foundation, mental health, and housing agency sectors. Specifically this landmark initiative proposes to do the following in partnership with the previously mentioned key leaders: Create new and improved permanent housing options for Tennesseans with mental illness; Aggressively and strategically seek out and collaborate with potential untapped funding entities to leverage state dollarsand funnel housing funds to local communities; Achieve greater parity in the availability of safe, affordable, and appropriate housing for people with mental illness, as compared with the population at large; Reduce the recidivism rate of persons diagnosed with a mental illness who are in our criminal justice system because of the lack of community housing and support systems; and Reduce the rate of unnecessary stays in hospital beds in regional mental health institutes that are directly attributable to inadequate, available housing. Homeland Security In response to the events of September 11, 2001, Tennessee has established the Office of Homeland Security. Funds have been provided to various departments for water supply protection, bomb and arson investigations, military equipment, emergency management, biological and other local health services, food and agricultural protection, criminal intelligence analysis and investigation, additional trooper equipment and operational costs, and additional security of state property and mail. The Homeland Security Office is responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy to secure the State of Tennessee from terrorist threats and attacks. The office interacts with the federal Departmentof Homeland Security and coordinates state homeland security actions through the state Homeland Security Council in order to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all Tennesseans. The General Assembly enacted the \"Terrorism Prevention and Response Act of 2002\". The Act defines and classifies specific terrorist related criminal offenses, establishes the appropriate jurisdiction for terrorist related criminal offenses, and details procedures for investigating terrorist related activities.Natural Resources The Environment Tennessee continues to be a leader in innovative approaches to protecting the environment and conserving natural resources in the Southeast. Water Quality - Siltation is the largest cause of water quality impairment in Tennessee streams. TDEC has launched a pilot program to train developers, contractors, road builders, and others involved in land disturbance on the best practices for preventing erosion and water pollution. The department also launched a new emphasis on preserving small streams, which are vital to overall water quality, flood control and wildlife. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved 70 total maximum daily load (TMDL) studies by TDEC. TMDLs provide the foundation for reducing specific pollutants in individual streams. TDEC continues to help communities across the state improve their wastewater treatment services. Tennessee awarded over $23 million in 2002 to local governments from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Drinking Water - Tennessee is training water system personnel on a number of new rules that became effective in January, 2002. These include interim enhanced surface water treatment requirements, revisions to the lead and copper rule and new disinfection byproduct standards. The state awarded more than $22 million in funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund in 2002 to improve local drinking water treatment facilities. Special assistance has been given to water suppliers to ensure the safety of water treatment facilities and their infrastructure following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Natural Areas and Scenic Rivers - Tennessee now has 66 designated State Natural Areas covering more than 100,000 acres. Twenty-nineof those areas have been added since 1994, with more under consideration. Four new State Natural Areas were established and five existing areas were expanded in 2002. Natural Areas protect the habitat of rare and endangered plants and animals. Natural areas also provide opportunities for outdoor recreation such as nature photography, study and hiking. T he Scenic Rivers program has a pilot, voluntary land preservation effort along the newly designated Duck Scenic River in Maury County. TDEC is responsible for a total of 13 designated State Scenic Rivers. Water Supply - The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) is implementing the Inter-Basin Water Transfer Act of 2000. This law addresses increasing demands for water and protects supply for downstream users. Air Quality - Tennessee is preparing to meet stricter new standards for ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter. An ozone forecasting program based on the new ozone standard has begun in Kingsport, Knoxville, Nashville, and Memphis to give citizens advance warning should ozone reach unhealthy levels. Tennessee has worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority to get a plan in place for significant early reductions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide at several fossil-fuel plants across the state. Additionally, Tennessee is working with Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina to develop a joint multi-pollutant air strategy to reduce power plant emissions and to develop innovative regional transportation and energy plans to improve air quality in the region. Solid and Hazardous Waste - In 2002, TDEC conducted 412 inspections of permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposalfacilities, and hazardous waste generators. Staff reviewed approximately 3,503 annual reports from hazardous waste facilities to ensure proper management of hazardous waste from \"the cradle to the grave.\" TDEC directed investigations and cleanup activities at 273 brownfields, contaminated drycleaners, and inactive hazardous substance sites. Responsible parties reported spending $16.1 million to treat and dispose of 15,250 tons of contaminated soil. TDEC also worked with approximately 300 other contaminated sites and received over 400 notifications of spills and releases. TDEC's emergency response contractor cleaned up abandoned hazardous materials at 12 sites. Strong Enforcement for Polluters - TDEC continues to move swiftly against those who break environmental laws. In calendar year 2002, TDEC issued 832 enforcement orders assessing over $6.3 million in penalties. Radiological Health - TDEC is implementing a major change in its program for x-ray inspections performed by outside consultants, known as registered inspectors. This is the first major change since the program began in 1982. The changes will improve the timeliness of correction of violations noted by the inspectors and will improve the efficiency of inspection planning overall. Homeland Security - TDEC is coordinating internally and with other state, local and federal agencies to ensure Tennesseans are protected from any threats to our air, land and water from terrorism. Conservation State Parks - Tennessee State Parks are open. State parks are a favorite destination for familiesand conferences alike, drawing over 30 million people each year. To enhance revenue at resort parks, TDEC is improving the State Parks web site, which received over 450,000 hits per month in 2002. The improvements will help make the most of this effective and inexpensive marketing tool. To help support park maintenance and operations, the department is collecting access fees at 23 state parks. The department collected $579,251 in access fees in the last fiscal year. Recreation Education - The Parks and Recreation Technical Advisory Services (PARTAS) established regional offices in East, Middle, and West Tennessee to better serve local governments. PARTAS provides technical assistance and education to professionals across the state, while setting the benchmark for safety and trends in parks and recreation. In cooperation with the Council on Greenways and Trails, TDEC completed the Tennessee Greenways & Trails Plan . The plan identifies and addresses critical issues related to the development of a statewide greenway and trail system. Geology and Archaeology - TDEC s taff investigated more than 50 geologic hazards and responded to nearly 350 other geologic information requests in the last fiscal year. The State Oil and Gas Board issued 140 oil and gas well permits. Staff performed 550 site inspections, issued seven citations, and plugged 130 wells. TDEC maintains records on 20,000 known archaeological sites and all previous studies in Tennessee. Using this information, division staff works with federal, state and local governments and private developers to find innovative ways to protect and preserve archaeological sites.1990 2001 Total Population 4,877,203 5,740,021 1990 2000 Percent of Population by Age Group Under Age 5 7.0% 6.6% Age 5 to 17 18.1% 18.0% Age 18 to 24 10.9% 9.6% Age 25 to 64 51.4% 53.4% Age 65 and Older 12.6% 12.4% Median Age 33.5 35.9 Percent of Population by Race White 83.0% 80.2% Black or African American 16.0% 16.4% American Indian and Alaska Native 0.2% 0.3% Asian and Pacific Islander 0.7% 1.0% Other 0.2% 2.1% Hispanic Population (Percent of Total Population) 0.7% 2.2% 1996 2001 Per Capita Income2 Tennessee's Per Capita Income $22,022 $26,988 U.

The Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee prepared this summary of current economic conditions and expectations for short-term economic growth in Tennessee and the nation. For additional information, see the most recent edition of \"An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee.\" Economic conditions have an important influence on revenue performance and service delivery needs, thus affecting both sides of the state budget. The recent downturn and the subsequent slow economic expansion have highlighted the way the economy affects state budgets, particularly revenues. Most states now are trying to close budget gaps for the current fiscal year and develop budgets for 2003-04 that reflect only modest improvement in economic conditions. For more information on recent economic conditions and the outlook for the nation and the state, see the most recent issue of An Economic Report to the Governor of the State of Tennessee . Recent Economic Conditions - A \"jobless recovery\" is the term analysts use to describe current post-recession economic activity in the U.S. While inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is expected to have advanced 2.4 percent in 2002, jobs fell at a 0.9 percent pace. On a year- over-year basis the national economy shed jobs in each month of the last year. While it is no surprise that the manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the losses, the 5.5 percent loss in jobs for the year as a whole is quite significant. It is particularly discouraging that the rate of job decay in manufacturing increased from the third to the final quarter of 2002. Low inventories outside of the automobile sector offer some hope for increased production and lower rates of job decay over the near term. Manufacturing is not the only sector to experience setbacks for the year. Mining, construction, transportation, public utilities and thefederal government sectors also saw jobs decline. The absence of stronger job growth is attributed to declining exports and growing imports, and the failure of business investment to show sharp resurgence following the recession. The situation in Tennessee largely mirrors the nation. Inflation-adjusted personal income--the broadest and most timely measure of overall economic activity in the state--grew 2.2 percent in 2002 versus 1.6 percent for the nation. At the same time the state saw total nonagricultural jobs shrivel by 0.2 percent and jobs in the manufacturing sector contract by 2.6 percent. Like the nation, Tennessee lost jobs in each month of 2002. In December the state posted a 4.7 percent unemployment rate while the national rate of unemployment came in at 6.0 percent. So while the state economy has struggled in recent periods, it has generally outperformed its national counterpart. Short-term Economic Outlook - The outlook today is quite similar to the outlook that prevailed in early 2002: everyone is anxiously awaiting a catalyst that will surface and jumpstart the economy. One potentially important catalyst is business fixed investment, which was viewed as the national economy's best hope for a return to stronger growth last year. But overall investment remained in the red through the third quarter of 2002 pulled down by sharp contractions in transportation equipment and structures investment. While investment in structures is expected to continue to struggle, overall investment is expected to record a gain of 7.0 percent by the second quarter of 2003, thus helping to bring overall investment up to 4.8 percent for the year. If consumer confidence remains strong and a prolonged war with Iraq can be avoided, U.S. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product should register 3.1 percent growth for the year. Payroll employment should expand 0.7 percent in 2003 while job losses in manufacturing will be cut nearly in half. The state economy is expected to show slow and steady improvement into 2004. Inflation- adjusted personal income for 2003 is projected togrow 2.7 percent. Growth for the 2003-04 fiscal year is forecast at 4.3 percent reflecting steady improvement in economic conditions as the economy moves through 2004. State labor markets are expected to show marked improvement over the performance of the last couple of years. Totalnonagricultural jobs are expected to be up 0.7 percent for calendar year 2003 or 1.4 percent for the upcoming fiscal year. Manufacturing will enjoy only modest improvement with expectations calling for a 1 .1 percent rate of job loss for the calendar year.

If the state were still receiving 27 cents of every budgeted dollar as federal aid, an additional $595.7 million would be available in federal funds. In constant (2003-2004) dollars, federal aid has increased by 64.1 percent, or $1.2 billion, from 1979-80 to 2003-2004 for state programs other than Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC grants. Figure 1 and Table 1 show the constant (2003-2004) dollar trend in federal aid in the state budget since 1979-80 for all programs,including transportation. Amounts for fiscal years 1979-80 through 2001-2002 are based on actual federal aid collections; amounts for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 are based on estimates included in the recommended state budget. Current dollars have been converted to real (co nstant) dollars using the gross domestic product implicit price deflator, as reported by the Un iversity of Tennessee, Center for Business and Economic Research. The decline in federal aid in the early 1980s (Figure 1) reflects the elimination of federal revenue sharing for states, new federal restrictions on eligibility for the TANF/AFDC pr ogram, and the con- solidation of several federal grant programs into block grants at reduced levels. From 1988-89 to 2003-2004, all the programs other than TANF/AFDC and Food Stamps have had real growth. This r eflects congre ssional decisions in the late 1980s to relax the earlier federal deficit-control statutes, which had r estrained the growth of dome stic discretionary programs during the 1980s. As shown in Figure 1, not until 1992-93 does \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Medicaid, TANF/AFDC grants, and Food Stamps, return to the real-dollar level available to the state in 1979-80. Reflecting recent domestic1980 82 84 86 88 1990 92 94 96 98 2000 02 04TANF/AFDCFood StampsMedicaidAll OtherTotal0123456Figure 1 Federal Aid Trend in State Programs FY 1980 through FY 2004 in Billions of Constant (2003-2004) Dollarsinitiatives, the growth rate for this federal aid category has begun to increase, in spite of federal budget-balancing efforts. In 2003-2004, \"all other\" federal aid, excluding Food Stamps, Medicaid, and TANF/AFDC, shows a constant dollar increase compared with the year before. This is mainly because of an increase for education and social services programs. Over the 24-year period, Medicaid, the major federal entitlement pr ogram in the state budget, has had real growth well above the rate of inflation. Although total federal aid has increased in constant dollars by 173.5 percent from 1979-80 to 2003-2004, the 708.6 percent real growth in the Medicaid program is accompanied by real growth of only 68.9 percent in federal aid for all other state programs, excluding Food Stamps and TANF/AFDC. A constant dollar increase of 20.1 percent in federal aid for the Food Stamps program since 1979-80 is related to Tennessee's recent increased caseload. The TANF/AFDC grants had a constant dollar decrease of 6.5 percent. Over the 24- year period, as shown in T able 1, real growth for all federal aid to state programs hasaveraged 4.3 percent per year. This growth above the rate of inflation has been led by the 9.1 percent annual-average real growth in the Medicaid program. TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.3 percent, while Food Stamps increased by 0.8 percent and all other federal aid increased by 2.2 percent on an annual-average basis. Over the last 15 years of the period, from 1988-89 through 2003-2004, real growth in total federal aid has increased above the longer-term growth rates. Total federal aid to state pr ograms has grown at a 15- year annual-average rate of 6.7 percent. Real growth in this period has averaged 9.5 percent per year for Med icaid and 2.9 percent per year in Food Stamps, while TANF/AFDC decreased by 0.2%. All other federal aid has grown at a real-dollar rate of 5.1 percent per year. The high growth rates in the Medicaid program in the late 1980s and early 1990s had begun to moderate, possibly because of managed care and the economy. However, the growth rate for Medicaid increased slightly in FY 2003-2004, perhaps as a result of the recent policy changes in the TennCare program. The federal Medicaid match rate Figure 2 Existing Federal Mandates State Cost Since FY 1987 Chart 93 95 97 99 01 03 Fiscal YearTable 1 Comparison of Federal Aid in State Budget, Actual 1979-80 through Estimated 2003-2004 In Millions of Constant (2003-2004) Dollars Increase Annual will increase for the fourth year on October 1, 2003. Medicaid accounts for 76 percent of the state mandate cost. The longer-term federal fun ding for mandated Medicaid expansions is accompanied by significant state costs, which are identified in detail below. While federal aid as a percentage of discretionary program funding has declined in the state budget since 1979-80, federal legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s has imposed increasingly costly mandates on state government. By fiscal year 2003-2004, when existing federal mandates will have been fully implemented, provisions imposed since 1986-87 will cost $295.4 million per year in recurring state appr opriations from General Fund tax sources. The cumulative state cost in 2001-2002 was $323.1 million and in 2002-2003 is $295.2 million. Fi gure 2 illustrates the annual recurring state cost, from General Fund tax sources, of new federal mandates beginning in fiscal year 1986-87. Costly major Medicaid mandates imposed since 1986-87 (Figure 3) are expanded ser vices under the 1988 catastrophic health care law; coverage of children aged one through 18 under 1989 and 1990 laws; payment of prem iums and deductibles for poor Medicare clients under a 1990 law; increase in the minimum wage for the nursing home program under a 1989 law; increases in the state Medicaid match rate as personal income increases; e xpansion of Medicaid eligibility under the 1988 federal welfare reform law; and drug purchasing reform under a 1990 law. Other Medicaid mandates include the 1988 nursing home reform initiative and the expansion of the child disability standard under the 1990 \"Zebley\" court ruling on supplemental security income regulations. Major federal mandates i mposed in other programs since fiscal year 1986-87 (Figure 4) include expansion of AFDC eligibility and support services u nder the 1988 federal welfare reform law; exemption from the sales tax of food stamps and supplemental foods for women, infants, andchildren; increases in the state match rate for the former AFDC pr ogram; intervention services for handicapped infants and toddlers in the K-12 education system; extensions of federal social security and Medicare payroll taxes under the 1990 federal budget act; national standards under the commercial drivers license law; and other items of lesser fiscal i mpact affecting several state agencies. For purposes of this analysis, the term \"federal mandates\" is limited to provisions of federal law or regulation which require state government implementation, without option to the state. This includes mandatory new pr ograms, changes in existing federal programs, and increases in state financial participation in jointly funded federal programs resulting from decreases in federal match rates.

Within the Department of Finance and Administration, the Division of Budget is responsible for budget development. Preparation, deliberation, and execution of the budget is a continual process throughout the year. This process regularly involves the Legislative and Executive branches, with occasional counsel from the Judicial Branch. The following chart indicates the participants in the budgetary process and an approximate time schedule. Function Participants Schedule Planning and Budget Division July Estimation Departments and Agencies August September Preparation of Budget Division October the Budget November December * January Legislative General Assembly * February-May Deliberation Budget Execution Budget Division June-July Legislative Committees Departments and Agencies *Note: The law requires the Governor to submit the Budget to the General Assembly prior to February 1, except at the beginning of a gubernatorial term, when the deadline is prior to March 1; unless, in either case, the General Assembly by Joint Resolution authorizes a later date. Planning and Estimation Immediately after a new fiscal year begins each July, the staff of the Division of Budget begins making plans for the budget that will be considered by the General Assembly for the subsequent fiscal year. These plans include designing and updating the forms and instructions used by departments and agencies in presenting their budget requests to the Division of Budget.These electronic forms and instructions are distributed to the agencies in August. The deadline for completion and transmission of the budget requests is the first of October. During this preparation period, the staff of the Division of Budget meets as needed with agencies' fiscal and program personnel to answer questions and provide assistance in developing their budget requests. In addition to projecting expenditure levels, estimates of the major revenue sources, such as the sales, franchise, excise and gasoline taxes, are prepared for both the current and next fiscal years. The revenue estimates are prepared by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration after receiving advice from the State Funding Board, as required by TCA section 9-4- 5202. All revenue estimates, including estimates for licenses and fees, are part of the budget review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Governor, and their staffs. Preparation of the Budget Chapter 33 of the Public Acts of 1937 granted the Governor the authority and duty to develop and submit to the General Assembly a recommended budget. The law directs the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to prepare the budget in accordance with the Governor's directives. After the receipt of agency budget requests, analysts with the Division of Budget begin the process of balancing expenditures against estimated revenues. Within this constraint, funds must be provided for Administration initiatives of high priority, activities mandated by state or federal statute, and the day-to-day operation of state government. Instructions for the agency budget requests include the submission of two levels of requests: (a) a base request, which accommodates the continuation of current services, and (b) an improvement request,The Budget Process which includes funds to implement mandated requirements, compensate for revenue reductions, initiate new programs, or enhance the base level due to increased costs of providing current services. Following analysis of the requests by the Division of Budget, detailed recom- mendations are made to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. Meetings are convened with commissioners and directors of the departments and agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Admin- istration. A consensus is sought with the agencies as to the appropriate funding level for the upcoming year. After these meetings are completed, the Budget Division staff makes any revisions that have been agreed upon and presents the estimates to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration for his and the Governor's consideration. The Governor and the commissioner review the recommendations resulting from these hearings and consider necessary alterations to fit within the scope of the Administration's initiatives and estimated revenues. The Governor may choose to conduct meetings or budget hearings with agency heads and may direct them to submit plans for further adjustments to their budgets. After gubernatorial decisions have been finalized, the staff of the Division of Budget prepares the Budget Document for printing. Meanwhile, work begins on the Governor's Budget Message. The Budget must be presented to the General Assembly prior to February 1, or prior to March 1 when a newly elected Governor takes office, unless the General Assembly by joint resolution allows submission on a later date. At the time the Budget Document and Budget Message are presented, the appropriation process is initiated. The Appropriations Bill, prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, is introduced and referred to the Finance, Ways, and Means committees of both houses of the Legislature. The various standing committees of the houses may review those parts of the AppropriationsBill that fall within their purviews. The departments often are invited to testify before these committees on issues relating to their budgets. After these committees report their reviews, the Finance, Ways and Means committees begin hearings on the budget in its entirety. Again, the departments may testify, and the Commissioner of Finance and Administration is invited to discuss the budget recommendations. Considerations made by the committees include the fiscal impacts caused by other legislation introduced by the members of both houses, recommendations of other legislative committees, and Appropriations Bill amendments filed by members of the Legislature. The Finance, Ways and Means committees of each house report out the Appropriations Bill with any amendments they recommend. The Appropriations Bill then is sent to Calendar committees of each house to be scheduled for floor action. The Senate and House of Representatives must pass the same Appropriations Bill in the same form for it to be enacted into law. Approval of the General Appropriations Bill usually occurs during the last week of the legislative session. In signing the bill into law, the Governor may line-item veto or reduce specific appropriations. Or, he could veto the entire bill; but this rarely would be done. Any veto may be over-ridden by a majority of the elected members, each house acting separately. Tennessee has a tradition of enacting a single General Appropriations Act each year. Budget Execution When passage of the Appropriations Bill is complete and is signed or enacted into law, the execution of the act begins. Two important concepts are involved: (a) the preparation of work programs and (b) the development of allotment controls. Invariably, there are changes to the Budget Document presented by the Governor to the General Assembly. TheseThe Budget Process changes are made by amending the Appropriations Act during the adoption process. Analysts of the Division of Budget and fiscal personnel in the departments and agencies have the responsibility of reconciling the approved Appropriations Act with the Budget Document. This may involve increases or decreases to the agency allotments. The Division of Budget establishes an annual allotment for each agency and division using the reconciled Appropriations Act. This annual allotment, called the official work program, is provided to the Division of Accounts as a means of spending control. The agencies and divisions spend against these allotments during the fiscal year. Budget execution is a process that continues throughout the fiscal year. In addition to the daily review of numerous operational and personnel transaction requests, the budget analysts must ensure that the legislative intent of the Appropriations Act is being followed by the various departments and agencies. Further legislative review and control is maintained through the Fiscal Review Committee, other oversight committees, and the Finance, Ways and Means committees. In addition to the review of agency activities by these bodies, the Finance, Ways and Means committees must be informed of any new or expanded programs resulting from unanticipated departmental revenues. These revenues usually are new federal grants, but also may be other departmental revenues. When notice of unexpected revenue is received by an agency, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, if he wants to approve the program expansion, may submit an expansion report to the chairmen of the finance committees for acknowledgement. Upon the chairmen's acknowledgement of the expansion report, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration may allot the additional departmental revenue to implement the proposed or expanded program. Agencies may not expand programs or implement new programs on their ownauthority. This expansion procedure is not used to increase allotments funded from state tax revenue sources. No appropriations from state tax sources may be increased except pursuant to appropriations made by law. A transfer of appropriations between allotments for purposes other than those for which they were appropriated may not occur without the approval of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and a committee comprised of the Speakers of the House and the Senate and the Comptroller of the Treasury. Throughout the fiscal year, the Budget Division staff reviews the status of the various allotments and advises the Commissioner of Finance and Admin- istration of any problems. At the end of the fiscal year, the Division of Budget has the responsibility of executing revisions to the annual allotments as a function of the accounts closing process. Audit and Review Post-audit and review also are functions that continue throughout the fiscal year. Post-audit is a responsibility of the Comptroller of the Treasury, an official elected by the General Assembly. The Division of State Audit, within the Comptroller's Office, has the duty of conducting, supervising, and monitoring the audits of all state departments and agencies. Intermediate care facilities receiving Medicaid funds also are within the purview of this division, and state grants to other entities also are subject to audit. In addition, program audits are performed to determine whether agencies are functioning efficiently. The General Assembly also participates in a continuing review throughout the fiscal year. The Fiscal Review Committee, a bipartisan committee comprised of members from both houses, meets regularly when the General Assembly is not in session. Following a set agenda, members of this committee review audit reports and departmental personnel respond to inquiries about activities and programs under theThe Budget Process department's jurisdiction. In addition, legislative oversight committees conduct extensive review in areas of special interest, such as correctional issues and children's services. Joint legislative committees and subcommittees occasionally are appointed for in-depth study of specific areas. Governmental Accountability: Performance-Based Budgeting and Strategic Planning : Looking Forward to 2004-2005 Chapter 875 of the Public Acts of 2002 enacted the Governmental Accountability Act. This law alters the budget law to require strategic planning and to begin the phase-in of performance-based budgeting in fiscal year 2004-2005. Although Executive Branch departments and some smaller agencies have developed strategic plans for years, all agencies now will be required by law to do so, beginning a year before being phased in to performance-based budgeting. By July 1 each year, Executive Branch agencies, including higher education, will submit strategic plans to the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, who may require modifications. He must consolidate approved plans and submit them to the Governor and General Assembly by September 1 each year, beginning in 2003 for the performance-based agencies. The Judicial Branch, Comptroller of Treasury, State Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attorney General and Reporter, and Legislative Branch are not subject to strategic plan review by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. They must submit plans separately to the General Assembly and Governor by September 1. The General Assembly retains final approval authority for agency strategic plan and performance measures through the general appropriations act. In addition to setting forth program objectives, strategic plans must include performance measures and standards for each program, partly defined as a budgetary unit. Under this law, instructions for development of strategic plans and performance measures will be issued toExecutive Branch agencies by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, who under other law also issues budget instructions to all agencies. In 2002, at the direction of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, a strategic planning function, previously free-standing in the department, was transferred into the Division of Budget. In these ways -- by definition of programs as budgetary units, by common authority to issue planning and budget instructions, and by inclusion of the strategic planning unit in the central executive Budget Office -- planning and budgeting in the Executive Branch now are closely linked. Performance-based budget requests must be submitted by three agencies for fiscal year 2004-2005. The first three agencies designated by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration are the departments of Revenue, Safety, and Environment and Conservation. All other Executive Branch agencies must be phased in to performance-based budgeting by fiscal year 2011-2012, on a schedule to be determined by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The recommended Budget Document must include a program statement and performance measures. The Governmental Accountability Act requires the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to report annually, for agencies subject to performance-based budgeting, on compliance with strategic plans and performance measures. The report must be made to the Governor and the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees. The Governmental Accountability Commission -- comprised of the Comptroller of the Treasury, Executive Director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and the Director of the Office of Legislative Budget Analysis -- must comment in writing to the Senate and House Finance committees on the commissioner's performance report. The Accountability Commission also may make recommendations to the FinanceThe Budget Process Committees on the strategic plan and actual performance of agencies subject to performance-based budgeting, on the reasonableness of recommended performance measures and standards, and on any other matter regarding strategic planning and program performance. The performance report and commission comments must be made at a time to allow consideration of the reports while the Appropriations Bill is being considered by the Finance committees. Also under the Governmental Accountability Act, as well as under other law, each state agency is subject to performance review by the Comptroller of the Treasury.As enacted in 2002, the Governmental Accountability Act continues the Tennessee tradition of strong Executive management of the line agencies, begun with the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1923, and strong Executive budget development and budget execution responsibility, begun with the budget law of 1937. At the same time, the 2002 Act continues the prerogative of the General Assembly to alter agency plans and Executive recommendations through the Appropriations Act and to alter policy and exert oversight through the Legislative and performance review processes.State of Tennessee Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Budgeting Basis The annual budget of the State of Tennessee is prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting with several exceptions, principally the effect of encumbrance and highway construction contractual obligations. Unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of each fiscal year, with the encumbered appropriations being carried forward to the next year. Most revenue collection estimates are presented on a modified accrual basis, consistent with the basis of accounting explained below. The law requires the Governor to present his proposed budget to the General Assembly annually. The General Assembly enacts the budget through passage of a general appropriations act. This act appropriates funds at the program level. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the budget, in the form of the Appropriations Act, becomes the state's financial plan for the coming year. Budgetary control is maintained at the program level by the individual departments and agencies, acting in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Administration. The latter has a Division of Budget and a Division of Accounts to execute budgetary controls. The Budget Document details the separation between payroll and operational funds by program. Any movement of funds between the payroll and operational funds requires approval and a revision to the budget by the Budget Division on behalf of the Commissioner of Finance and Administration and the Governor. Other budget revisions during the year, reflecting program changes or intradepartmental transfers of an administrative nature, require certain executive and legislative branch approval, pursuant to law. This is discussed in detail in the \"Budget Process\" subsection. With proper legal authority, the Division of Budget, acting on behalf of the Governorand Commissioner of Finance and Administration, may execute allotment (or budget) revisions. The line agencies may not make these revisions themselves. In Tennessee, as in other states, appropriation of funds is a legislative power, not an executive power. No expenditures may be made, and no allotments increased, except pursuant to appropriations made by law. For Budget Document purposes, all funds are classified as General Fund except for the Department of Transportation (Transportation, or Highway, Fund), Capital Outlay (Capital Projects Fund), Facilities Revolving Fund, Debt Service (or Sinking) Fund, and Cities and Counties - State Shared Taxes (Local Government Fund). The Education Trust Fund, for which state tax revenues are estimated separately, is included in the General Fund in the presentation of the Budget Overview, although a separate fund balance statement for this fund is included in the \"Financial Statements\" section of the Budget Document. The presentation of all the operating budgets within the General Fund in the Budget Document, except for Transportation, is done for ease of budget presentation and understanding. In the Budget, revenue estimates for Special Revenue, Internal Service, and Enterprise Fund programs, funded by dedicated revenues, are included in the state tax revenue and departmental revenue estimates in the General Fund, as are those programs' expenditures. Special Revenue Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Wildlife Resources Agency Boating Safety Wetlands Acquisition Fund Wetlands Compensation Fund Tennessee Regulatory Authority Criminal Injuries CompensationBasis of Budgeting and Accounting Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund Grain Indemnity Fund Certified Cotton Growers' Organization Fund Agricultural Regulatory Fund Local Parks Acquisition Fund State Lands Acquisition Fund Used Oil Collection Program Tennessee Dry Cleaners Environmental Response Fund Abandoned Lands Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Fund Underground Storage Tank Solid Waste Assistance Environmental Protection Fund Sex Offender Treatment Program Small and Minority-owned Telecommunications Program Job Skills Fund 911 Emergency Communications Fund Real Estate Education and Recovery Fund Auctioneer Education and Recovery Fund Motorcycle Rider Education Driver Education C.I.D. Anti-Theft Unit Board of Professional Responsibility Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program Continuing Legal Representation Internal Service Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Capitol Print Shop Claims Award Fund TRICOR Office of Information Resources Division of Accounts Postal Services Motor Vehicle Management Printing Purchasing Records Management Central Stores Food Services Program Enterprise Fund programs reflected in the General Fund in the Budget Document are: Tennessee Housing Development AgencyProperty Utilization Child Care Facilities Fund Client Protection Fund In the \"Budget Overview,\" Education Trust Fund programs are presented in the General Fund, although the tax apportionments for the Education Fund are separately estimated. This, again, is done for ease of presentation and understanding of the budget. It also is done because the taxes earmarked and apportioned to the Education Fund are less than the Education appropriations, requiring General Fund tax support for Education programs. The programs in the Education Trust Fund are: (1) Department of Education (K- 12); (2) Higher Education, including state appropriations for the University of Tennessee, the State University and Community College System (Board of Regents), and the Foreign Language Institute; and (3) all funding sources for programs of the Higher Education Commission and the Student Assistance Corporation. In the Budget Document, certain institutional revenues for the two university systems are estimated. These include unrestricted educational and general revenues (E&G), and auxiliary enterprise funds. Examples of unrestricted E&G funds are student tuition and fees; unrestricted state, federal, local, and private gifts, grants, and contracts; local appropriations; and sales and services related to academic programs. Restricted funds are not reflected in the Budget Document. Although presenting the operating budgets in this consolidated fashion makes the budget easier to understand, the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) does deal with all of the Special Revenue and other funds as separate from the General Fund. The Division of Accounts provides that document to the General Assembly and the public.Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Accounting Basis (From Division of Accounts, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report) The financial statements of the State of Tennessee are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These principles require that the financial statements present the primary government and its component units, or the entities for which the government is considered to be financially accountable. Component units are discretely presented in a separate column in the government-wide financial statements to emphasize legal separation from the primary government. In the government-wide financial statements, the financial activities of the state are reported as governmental or business-type activities. The government- wide financial statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. In the fund financial statements, the state's major governmental funds include: General Fund - used to account for all financial transactions not required to be accounted for in other funds; Education Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with programs involving the Department of Education and Higher Education. Funding is provided primarily from the dedicated sales and services taxes and federal monies received from the U.S. Department of Education. Highway Fund - used to account for revenues and expenditures associated with the Department of Transportation. Funding is provided from dedicated highway user taxes and funds received from the various federal transportation agencies.The state's non-major governmental funds , reported in a single column, include: Special Revenue Fund - used to account for specific revenues earmarked to finance particular or restricted programs and activities; Debt Service Fund - used to account for the payment of principal and interest on general long-term debt; Capital Projects Fund - used to account for the acquisition or construction of all major governmental capital facilities; and, Permanent Funds - used to account for legally restricted funds where only earnings, not principal, can be spent. All of the governmental funds are accounted for on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this basis, revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are typically recorded only when payment is due. Sales taxes, petroleum and vehicular related taxes and fees, and gross receipt taxes are considered to be available if received in the first 60 days of the new fiscal year. Federal grants, departmental services, and interest associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be available if received in twelve months. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the State. Encumbrance accounting is utilized for budgetary control purposes in governmental fund types. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end are reported as reservations of fund balance for subsequent year expenditure. The state's proprietary fund financial statements include:Basis of Budgeting and Accounting Enterprise Funds - used to account for the operations of self-sustaining state agencies providing goods or services to the general public on a user-charge basis. Two of these funds are considered major funds - Sewage Treatment Loan Fund and Employment Security Fund. Non-major funds are reported in a single column. Internal Service Funds - used to account for services provided to other departments or agencies of the state or other governments, on a cost reimbursement basis. These funds are reported in a single column. The proprietary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. The state's fiduciary funds financial statements include: Pension Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- administered retirement system; Investment Trust Fund - used to account for the activities of the state- sponsored external investment pool; Private-Purpose Trust Funds - used to report trust arrangements under which the principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments; and, Agency Funds - used to account for amounts held in custody of others. Fiduciary fund types are used to account for resources legally held in trust. The fiduciary funds are accounted for on the accrual basis of accounting. Discretely presented component units include: Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) Community Services Agencies Tennessee Certified Cotton Growers OrganizationTennessee Housing Development Agency Tennessee Local Development Authority Tennessee State Veterans Homes Board Child Care Facilities Corporation Tennessee State School Bond Authority Tennessee Board of Regents University of Tennessee Board of Trustees. Accounting Changes Effective July 1, 2001 The financial statements for the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2002 are presented with an unprecedented number of accounting changes as a result of standards promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The changes include GASB Statements 33, 34, 35 and 38. GASB Statement 33 establishes accounting and financial reporting for non- exchange transactions involving financial or capital resources. GASB Statement 34 provides for a new set of financial statements for the state as a whole on the accrual basis of accounting (Government-wide Statements), a new financial narrative entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis as required supplementary information, and considerable changes to fund financial statements which continue to be required on a modified accrual basis of accounting. Additional note disclosure requirements are also imposed. GASB Statement 35, an amendment of GASB Statement 34, requires colleges and universities to report as a business-type activity using enterprise fund accounting in accordance with provisions of GASB 34. GASB Statement 38 modifies, establishes and rescinds certain financial statement disclosure requirements. The primary change is to require additional disclosure of the details of receivables, payables, and transfers.State Revenues Table of Contents State Tax Revenues ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...A-65 State Funding Revenue Estimates ................................ ................................ ........... ................................ ...............................

A-113State of Tennessee State Tax Revenues Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2003-2004 The revenues necessary to finance state government are collected from a variety of sources. The primary source of funding for state expenditures is appropriation from general revenues. General revenues are proceeds from taxes, licenses, fees, fines, forfeitures, and other imposts laid specifically by law. The revenue estimating process generally starts twelve months before a fiscal year begins. Revenue collections are tracked on a monthly basis, and this information, along with specific long-run forecasts of individual sectors of the economy, is used to form the basis for the next fiscal year's estimated revenue collections. Preliminary estimates are supplied to the Department of Finance and Administration in mid- summer by the Department of Revenue and the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research. Tax estimates are recalculated in October and November and refined in December and January for inclusion in the Governor's Budget Document. Sales tax estimates are based on estimated retail sales activity, which is provided by the Center for Business and Economic Research. Corporate excise tax estimates are made as late as possible in the year to take advantage of the latest available corporate profit forecasts for the nation and the October state tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue, which provide information useful in projecting quarterly estimated corporate tax payments through the next year. Estimates for selective excise taxes are commonly based on long-run consumption trends for the selectively-taxed items: cigarettes, gasoline, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Long-run trend analysis is also used as a basis for projecting corporate excise and franchise tax collections and Tennessee Valley Authority in lieu of tax payments. Motor vehicle fuel (primarily diesel fuel) taxes and motor vehicle registration fees areestimated conservatively, given their sensitivity to business cycles (especially the truck-related components of both taxes). The revenue estimating process in Tennessee incorporates the \"Good Practices in Revenue Estimating\" endorsed by the National Association of State Budget Officers and the Federation of Tax Administrators. This requires the use of national and state economic forecasts, development of an official revenue estimate, monitoring and monthly reporting on revenue collections, and revision of estimates when appropriate. Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) 9-4-5104, 5105, 5106, and 5202 specify the manner in which tax revenue estimates are prepared and transmitted to the General Assembly in the Budget Document. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration prepares revenue estimates based on advice from economists, his own staff, the Department of Revenue, and the State Funding Board. The Funding Board, which is composed of the Governor, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the Comptroller, the State Treasurer, and the Secretary of State, is assisted in preparing its range of revenue growth estimates by economists from the state's universities, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff of the Department of Finance and Administration, Department of Revenue, and of the Treasurer's Office. The Funding Board prepares and recommends a range of revenue growth estimates using the information provided by the economists, the executive director of the Fiscal Review Committee, and staff. The Funding Board's review and recommendations concern only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue. The growth estimates provide a basis for the tax revenue estimates that are used in preparing the budget. However, recommendation of revenue estimates in the Budget is the responsibility of the Governor and Commissioner of Finance and Administration. The State Funding Board's most recent letternotifying the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees of its revenue growth estimates is included in the following subsection entitled \"State Funding Board, Range of Tax Revenue Estimates.\" This letter states the economic assumptions affecting the Funding Board's recommendations. A more detailed economic overview is presented in the \"Budget Overview\" section of the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the Budget Document are shown in a following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" These taxes include not only the taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes), but also those collected and deposited to the General Fund by some other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. In the revenue estimate charts, the latter are shown by collecting agency and are subtotaled as \"other state revenue.\" Following the chart comparing taxes for the three fiscal years, three charts are included to show the collections distributed by fund. The funds on the distribution charts, for Budget Document presentation, are General Fund, Education (Trust) Fund, Highway (Transportation) Fund, Debt Service Fund, and Cities and Counties (Local Government Fund). (For information about the inclusion of certain Special Revenue Fund taxes and fees in the General Fund estimates, see the \"Budget Overview\" subsection entitled \"Basis of Budgeting and Accounting.\") Following the four tax revenue estimate charts is a chart detailing the revenues of regulatory boards, with the collections and estimates listed by board. This is a supporting schedule to the \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues\" charts, on which single lines for regulatory board fees appear. In addition to the general revenues detailed in this section, other revenues are collected by departments, institutions, and agencies and are appropriated directly to them. These are calleddepartmental revenues. In the Budget Document, these departmental revenues are estimated by program and are shown as federal revenue, other revenue (or, sometimes, current services and other revenue), and tuition and fees. The term \"other revenue\" includes interdepartmental revenue, current services revenue, non-governmental revenue, and revenue from cities and counties. These various departmental revenues consist of earnings and charges for goods and services; student tuition and fees in the higher education system; and donations, contributions, and grants- in-aid from the federal government, political subdivisions, foundations, corporations, and individuals. In a few cases, the other departmental revenues also include reserves from revolving funds or from the unencumbered balance and capital outlay (major maintenance) reserves, in instances in which specific legal authority to carry such funds forward exists. The departmental revenues are reflected in each department's budget as operating revenue. Information presented in the subsection entitled \"Revenue Sources and Basis of Apportionment\" outlines the general tax revenues by collecting agency, along with TCA citations on the rate and source of the revenue and the basis of apportionment among funds and agencies, based on current law. The tax revenue estimates proposed in this Budget are provided in the following subsection entitled \"Comparison Statement of State Revenues.\" The distribution of taxes among the funds on these charts is as provided by law as it existed last year for 2001-2002 actual revenue and as it exists currently for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 estimates. However, this Budget recommends that the distributions to the Highway Fund and Cities and Counties (state-shared taxes) Fund be reduced by 9 percent and redirected to the General Fund. Following that subsection is a subsection detailing so-called tax expenditures, which reports on major tax exemptions provided by law.State Funding Board Range of Tax Revenue EstimatesCOMPARISON OF ESTIMATED STATE TAX REVENUE FOR Attachment 1 FISCAL YEAR 2002-2003 (Accrual - Basis Estimates) DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE 2001-2002 07/01/2002 % CHANGE 12/11/2002 % CHANGE 12/11/2002 % CHANGE 12/11/2002 % CHANGE 12/11/2002 % CHANGE 12/11/2002 % CHANGE ACTUAL BUDGETED OVER 01-02 ESTIMATE OVER 01-02 ESTIMATE OVER 01-02 ESTIMATE OVER 01-02 ESTIMATE OVER 01-02 ESTIMATE OVER 01-02 SOURCE OF REVENUE COLLECTIONS ESTIMATE(1) ACTUAL DR.

Vendors compensation for collection of the sales tax was repealed, effective July 1, 2000, by Public Acts of 2000, chapter 983. Thus, no report is made on vendors compensation. Tax Exemptions It is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue lost for each of the tax exemptions found in the Tennessee code. For example, since 1947, the list of non-profit institutions that are exempt from the sales tax has grown dramatically. Such institutions are allowed tobuy tangible goods and certain services tax free. Retailers and sellers require proof of exemption and keep records of exempt sales; but tax returns filed with the Department of Revenue do not show detailed statistics on exempt sales by type of exempt entity. Such data is only available in the records of the thousands of individual retailers and vendors who sell directly to the public. Therefore, the tax exemptions listed in the present report consist only of those that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The fiscal impact of Tennessee's major tax exemptions is presented in tabular form in Tables 1-A and 1-B. Estimates of revenue loss are provided for FY 2003-2004. Table 1-A presents revenue foregone on services not currently taxed. These services represent activities that were not included in the original tax base. Table 1-B presents revenue foregone due to specific exemptions in the existing sales tax law. For each item in this table, the exemption is briefly described and the specific authorization of the Tennessee code is cited. It is difficult to estimate the true cost of tax exemptions for two reasons. First, each exemption is considered separately, without regard to how it overlaps with other provisions of the tax code. Summing tax exemptions may result in double-counting in cases where exemptions overlap. Secondly, the estimates of revenue loss provided in the tables do not generally take into account the impact of a change in a particular tax provision on taxpayer behavior which impacts other taxes (the estimates do not reflect secondary or feedback effects).Service/Product Area Exempted StateLocal* Administrative & Support Services $246,800,000$84,500,000Collection Agencies & Credit Bureaus 20,000,000 6,900,000 Employment Services 135,700,000 46,500,000 Investigation & Security Services 27,600,000 9,400,000 Mail, Document Reproduction, & Call Centers 14,700,000 5,000,000 Services to Buildings & Dwellings 48,800,000 16,700,000 Construction Services $603,000,000 $206,700,000 Building, Developing, & General Contracting 209,100,000 71,700,000 Heavy Construction 53,700,000 18,400,000 Special Trade Services (for-profit) 12,500,000 4,300,000 Educational Services (non-profit) 1,900,000 600,000 Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate $194,800,000 $66,800,000 Investment Banking, Securities Brokerage, & Related Services 68,500,000 23,500,000 Insurance Agents & Related Services 50,700,000 17,400,000 Real Estate Agents & Brokers 75,600,000 25,900,000 Health Care & Social Services (For-profit) $604,000,000 $207,200,000 & Dentists 39,100,000 13,400,000 Hospitals 83,600,000 28,700,000 Nursing & Residential Care Facilities 95,000,000 32,600,000 Outpatient Care Centers 24,600,000 8,400,000 Medical and Diagnostic Laboratories 17,700,000 6,100,000 Other Selected Health Services 7,700,000 2,700,000 Social & Community Services 18,100,000 6,200,000 Health Care & Social Services (Non-profit) $362,900,000 $124,500,000 Hospitals 303,200,000 103,900,000 Nursing & Residential Care Facilities 18,800,000 6,500,000 Outpatient Care Centers 20,600,000 7,100,000 Other Selected Health Services 4,000,000 1,400,000 Social & Community Services 16,300,000 5,600,000 Information Services $50,000,000 $17,200,000 Data Processing Services 12,600,000 4,300,000 Movie Production & Sound Recording Studios 8,300,000 2,900,000 Cable T.V.

It was created by the 45th General Assembly through passage of Public Chapter 126, Public Acts of 1887, codified as Title 9, Chapter 9, Section 101 of the Tennessee Code. By statute, the state's full faith and credit, as well as specific tax revenues are pledged for the payment of principal and interest on state bonds. Additionally, the law covenants that such pledged revenues shall not be less than 150 percent of the amount necessary to service the state's outstanding debt and any debt proposed to be issued. Adequate safeguards are therefore embodied in law against the issuance of excessive debt, and the state's current and future debt service requirements are well below the established legal limits. Over the years, Tennessee has consistently maintained a relatively low debt burden. This has been accomplished through the use of sound, prudent, and conservative debt management practices adopted by the executive and legislative branches of government, with concurrence of the State Funding Board. Such practices include funding of the state's capital program with surplus cash, cancellation of bond authorizations in lieu of issuing debt, creating and maintaining an adequate \"Rainy Day Fund\" to offset unanticipated revenue shortfalls, and the adoption of state statutes to control the issuance of excessive debt. This consistent and conservative approach to the management of our debt earned the state triple bond ratings from the nation's leading credit rating agencies. However, our inability to solve the structural deficit that exists in the state's tax system and the continuing use of non-recurring funds to fund recurring expenses caused the three rating agencies to downgrade the state's bond ratings in 2001. As of July 19, 2002, the ratings on the state's general obligation debt are : Fitch AA for long term debt; Standard and Poor's Corporation (S&P) AA with a negative outlook for long term debt and A-1+ for Commercial Paper; and Moody's Investor Service Aa2negative outlook and P-1 for Commercial Paper. The state still enjoys a low debt burden, and access to the capital markets remains strong. However, the end result of lower credit ratings will be higher interest rates and increased debt service expense as the state issues future debt in order to fund its capital needs. During fiscal year 2001-2002 the state sold $164 million in general obligation bonds. At least one additional general obligation bond sale is anticipated prior to the close of this fiscal period. As of June 30, 2002, Tennessee's total general obligation bonded indebtedness was $969,660,000 excluding the Facilities Revolving Fund. This debt was issued entirely for institutional and building construction. The second session of the 102nd General Assembly approved new authorizations in the amount of $127,265,000. Of this amount, institutional and building bonds accounted for $35.6 million, the Facilities Revolving Fund $3.1 million, and highway bonds $77.0 million. The practice of using the state's cash flow to finance road projects in lieu of issuing debt has been one of the key factors in Tennessee's ability to secure and retain very high bond ratings. Consistent with this long-standing policy, the Funding Board, within the last 12 months has cancelled $77.0 million in highway bond authorizations and $7.6 million in institutional and building construction bonds. The increase in bond authorization coupled with the Funding Board's action on bond cancellations reduced the category of authorized but unissued bonds to $1,133,717,000, which includes $641,500,000 million in highway authorizations, $332,822,000 in capital construction bonds, and $93,511,600 in Facility Revolving Fund bonds. The 2003-2004 proposed budget recommends the authorization of an additional $74 million in highway construction bonds, $44 million in institutional and building bonds, and $6.6 million in federal funds to finance capital projects.Debt Service Fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Requirements July 1, 2001 -

A-144State of Tennessee Capital Budget Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004 The Capital Budget process begins with the receipt of departmental and agency capital maintenance and project requests. The various agencies and departments annually submit their capital requests in priority order to the Depar t- ment of Finance and Administration, Division of Budget. Upon receipt of the capital budget requests, three phases of review are undertaken by the Division of Capital Projects and Real Property Management and the Division of Budget. The initial phase allows for an understanding of the need by the Capital Projects and Real Property Management and Budget review teams. Phase two is built upon the technical requirements of the capital request, involving on-site visits by the review teams. The final phase involves financial review. The projects are analyzed for funding requirements and consistency with program goals and are reviewed within projected avai l- ability of funds in the budget for the requested fiscal year. If funds are deemed to be insuff i- cient, individual projects may be deferred to be included in future budgets or rejected. The Administration intends for the needs of departmental programs to be the impetus for all capital outlay requirements. Facilities funded through the capital budget process should su p- port program and service requirements. Ther e- fore, funding of projects is analyzed on priority of fiscal support for individual existing and new programs. The goal is to find the best mix of new capital outlay and facility maintenance in order to sustain and implement programs and services. The management of facilities should be flexible enough to adjust to changing programs through renovation of existing assets. Attempts are made to minimize operational costs and f u- ture capital expenditures through better design and more flexible layouts, as has been done in the state's new prisons. In the event that a cap i- tal project creates the need for additional oper a-tional funding, those funds are considered in the development of the budget in the year when the new space is expected to be occupied. Improvements to real property funded by public or private funds must be approved by the State Building Commission. The State Building Commission is composed of seven ex-officio members: the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, the Commi s- sioner of Finance and Administration, the Trea s- urer, and the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives. The State Building Commi s- sion, in addition to supervising improvements to real property, oversees leases by state agencies and the demolition of structures located on state property. The capital items presented in this document as recommendations to the General Assembly consist of projects meeting the requirements and policy guidelines of the State Building Commi s- sion. The capital project recommendations are itemized by department. Capital maintenance projects are defined as major, non-routine repairs, and replacements unrelated to new construction that cost $100,000 or more. Maintenance projects costing less than this amount are considered to be major maint e- nance items that are addressed within the d e- partments' operational budget major maint e- nance programs. Capital maintenance projects include items that appreciably extend the life of the facility, such as alterations to rectify code deficiencies, modifica tions to improve utility systems, repaving , roof repairs, exterior fencing and lighting, and repair projects that restore a facility to its former con dition and do not result in changes in facility use. Funding for these projects is included in the amount allocated to the Department of Finance and Administration, and projects are selected for completion accor d- ing to the review process ou tlined above. Capital outlay projects are defined as those providing new facilities or materially extendingCapital Budget the useful life and improving or changing the function of an existing facility. These projects include facility renovation, new construction, new utility or service systems, land with or without buildings, appurtenances, site improv e- ments or permanent betterments, and initial equipment to furnish and operate a new or i m- proved facility which require the assistance of a design profe ssional or cost $100,000 or more. For fiscal year 2003-2004, the capital proj- ects budget proposal recommends a total of $70,232,000 divided between capital outlays and capital maintenance requests. Capital Maintenance \u2014 Capital maintenance projects are recommended at a level of $49,692,000. State bond authorization is re c- ommended in the amount of $17,330,000 in 20 year bonds and $14,335,000 in 10 year bonds. Federal and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. These projects focus on mai n- taining current facilities, primarily through r e- pair and renovation of roofing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Funding is also included to bring state facilities in line with federal sta n- dards for underground storage tanks, asbestos, and citizens with disabilities. The Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tenne s- see are also funded for modifications to assist in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Capital Outlay \u2014 Capital outlays recommended for this fiscal year total $20,540,000. Of this total, $8,570,000 in 20 year bonds and $3,765,000 in 10 year bonds are requested. Fe d- eral and other sources equal the remainder of the total amount. Projects from dedicated sources of revenue are also recommended for the Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Wildlife R e- sources Agency. Facilities Revolving Fund \u2014 Capital projects and maintenance for the Facilities Revolving Fund is recommended at a funding level of $9,515,000. Facilities Revolving Fund capital projects are listed in the Facilities RevolvingFund section, which follows the Capital Projects section of this document. Operating Costs \u2014 Included within this section is an estimate of the first year operating costs resulting from proposed new construction. Di f- ferences in operating costs can be the result of efficiencies from better designs and energy sy s- tems or program requirements. Renovation pro j- ects, which do not have an impact on operating efficiencies, are considered to be cost neutral. Only those projects which have been determined to have increases or decreases in operating costs from the current budget have been included in the schedule. New Bond Authorizations \u2014 Capital maint e- nance, capital outlay and Facilities Revolving Fund requests will require new bond authoriz a- tions totaling $44,000,000. The chart below compares the bond authorizations recommended with those approved by the General Assembly during the past several years. BOND AUTHORIZATIONS RECOMMENDED VS.

2004 The Facilities Revolving Fund (FRF) was established in 1988 to provide efficient management of the state office and warehousing facilities. State agencies are charged a fair market rate for the space they occupy. These revenues, along with any necessary current services revenue and reserve funds constitute the operating funds for FRF. The fund pays for facilities management costs of state owned and leased office and warehouse space. These costs include debt service on buildings financed with bonds, routine and major maintenance, relocation expenses and furniture for state agencies, and payments for leased office space notowned by the state but occupied by state agencies. While FRF is administered by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration, the departments of General Services and Finance and Administration manage the daily operations of the fund. General Services operates, maintains, and manages FRF facilities. Finance and Administration constructs and renovates facilities through its Division of Capital Projects and Real Property Management with approval of the State Building Commission. The division also assigns space to agencies, handles lease acquisitions, and provides relocation services and furniture to agencies. The Department of General Services maintains the daily upkeep of FRF facilities through Operational Maintenance. Items such as contracts for janitorial and security services are funded through this allotment.

A-16 1 State Taxpayers Budget, Distribution of Estimated Revenue by Fund, Fiscal Year 2003-2004 .............. A-162State of Tennessee State Taxpayers Budget The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" section is included to distinguish between state appropriations from general state taxes and appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees, which are narrowly levied and earmarked for specific purposes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes the dedicated funds; it reports only appropriations from general state tax sources, along with estimates of the general taxes. The \"State Taxpayers Budget\" excludes appropriations from dedicated tax and fee sources, all federal revenues, and all other departmental revenues. This section begins with a departmental summary of state appropriations from general tax sources. The chart entitled \"Tennessee Taxpayer Budget, Departmental Summary of State Appropriations,\" includes this departmental summary information and a grand total for the State Taxpayers Budget appropriations. The chart then shows a single line-item for appropriations from dedicated state tax sources and a grand total state appropriation for the Budget Document, which reconciles to the total state appropriations in the remainder of the Budget Document. Following the departmental summary of state appropriations is a summary of appropriations from dedicated taxes and fees. This schedule summarizes the various departmental appropriations from dedicated state sources that are excluded from the State Taxpayers Budget. Examples of appropriations from dedicated state sources are the appropriations to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) from hunting and fishing license fees and from real estate transfer taxes supporting the Wetlands Acquisition Fund, administered by TWRA, and appropriations to regulatory agencies from fees imposed on health professions, other professions, banks, and environment- impacting industries. The third schedule in this section is amore detailed breakdown of the state appropriations from general tax sources. \"State Taxpayers Budget, State Appropriations by Program,\" itemizes these appropriations by program. As with the departmental summary, this schedule includes a single line item for appropriations from dedicated sources to balance to the total state appropriations elsewhere in the Budget Document. The tax revenue estimates recommended in the State Taxpayers Budget follow the appropriations by program. The chart entitled \"State Taxpayers Budget, Comparison Statement of State Revenues, \" includes taxes collected by the Department of Revenue (the major taxes) as well as those collected and deposited to the General Fund by other line agencies in conjunction with carrying out their programs. This chart excludes taxes and fees collected and deposited in the General Fund which are earmarked or dedicated for specific use. Distributions of taxes by fund for last year, the current year, and next year are on the following three charts. In the appropriation comparison charts, the 2003-2004 estimates for the Cities and Counties Fund (state-shared taxes) and Department of Transportation appropriations reflect a recommended base budget reduction, with the funds being redirected to the General Fund. Therefore, the 2003-2004 Cities and Counties Fund and Department of Transportation appropriations are lower than the tax estimates for the Cities and Counties Fund and Highway Fund in the \"State Revenues\" tax distribution charts. Except for the \"State Taxpayers Budget\" and a chart summarizing base budget reductions from a discretionary base, all of the other summary charts and program statements in this Budget Document that deal with appropriations include appropriations from all state sources, both general taxes and dedicated taxes and fees.State Taxpayers Budget Departmental Summary of State Appropriations * Fiscal Years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004 Actual Expenditures Estimated Recommended 2001-2002 * 2002-2003 2003-2004 General Fund and Education Fund 301 Legislature 25,584,100$ 29,563,100 $ 27,405,800 $ 302 Court System 70,280,800 303 Attorney General and Reporter 13,016,300 304 District Attorneys General Conference Secretary of State Public Defenders Conference Comptroller of the Treasury 39,405,000 Office of the 1,061,300 309 Treasury 5,090,600 4,510,300 Affairs 2,390,200 2,676,000 Labor and Workforce Development 12,486,200 19,034,100 Health and Developmental 143,040,800 353 Emergency and Contingency Fund - 819,300 819,300 355 State Building Commission Services 246,288,300 232,360,000 Capital Outlay ** 27,913,000 - Facilities Revolving Fund 113,800 321,600 321,600 Cities and Counties - State Shared Taxes 650,202,000 656,800,000 613,600,000 Grand Total State Taxpayers Budget 9,064,663,100$ Dedicated Tax Sources - Appropriation 212,551,900$ 255,679,900$ 261,860,600$ Grand Total State Appropriation - Budget Document 9,277,215,000$ 9,565,920,000$ 9,785,998,700$ * FY 2001-2002 is actual expenditures from appropriations, except as noted.

B-124State of Tennessee Education Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004 B-85his functional area is responsible for the educational efforts of the state, from pre-school and K-12 through all levels of higher education. The Department of Education coordinates the educational programs of the local public school systems that operate Tennessee's kinder garten, elementary, secondary, and vocational schools. The department also operates the four special schools: Tennessee School for the Blind, Tennessee School for the Deaf, West Tennessee School for the Deaf, and Alvin C. York Agricultural Institute. With assistance from the Department of Education, the State Board of Education formulates the policies, standards, and guidelines governing K-12 public education. The department is responsible for implementing these policies, standards, and guidelines. Higher education is governed by two independent systems: the University of Tennessee System and the State University and Community College System, more commonly known as the Tennessee Board of Regents System. The University of Tennessee is a statewide system with three major campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Martin, and a number of specialized units. The Board of Regents System delivers higher education and vocational training through a network of independent state universities, community colleges, technical institutes, technical community colleges, and technology centers. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) provides coordination, communication, policy analysis, and financial recommendations for both systems. The Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation administers student financial aid programs.Improvement Highlights K-12 Education An improvement of $26.7 million is recommended to provide funding for teacher salary equalization. These funds are recommended in order to address the Constitutional issue decided by the Tennessee Supreme Court. The funds will provide initial funding to the lowest paying local education agencies, raising all local education systems to a minimum $37,000 teacher salary average. An estimated 17,161 teachers in 75 school systems will receive a salary increase. $5.9 million of these funds will be dedicated to holding harmless those school systems not receiving additional teacher salary equalization funds under this appropriation. The budget also includes $84.2 million to maintain full funding of the Basic Education Program (BEP). This includes $33.8 million for formula growth; $16.3 million to annualize the teacher salary increases effective January 1, 2003; $25.8 million to annualize the January 1, 2003, group health insurance increase; and $8.3 million for the January 1, 2004, group health insurance increase. An improvement of $236,900 is also included for teacher training and experience salary adjustments at the state's four special schools. Higher Education Recommended in this budget is $500,000 to continue implementation of the Geier desegregation settlement agreement. These funds, in addition to the $10,765,000 recommended in the base budget, fully fund the anticipated expenditures in fiscal year 2003-2004. Major elements of the planB-86include appropriations for the Tennessee State University (TSU) Endowment for Educational Excellence; creation of new, high-demand academic programs at TSU; statewide recruitment and retention initiatives for African American students, faculty, and administrators, including scholarships, pre- doctoral fellowships, visiting professorships, pre-university summer programs, and minority financial aid; recruitment of other-race andnon-traditional students to TSU; and other academic programs at several University of Tennessee and Board of Regents institutions.

Implementation of the agreement will result in final resolution of the lawsuit that was filed in 1968. The settlement agreement is designed to \"create an educational system that enhances increased enrollment of African American students at the predominately white institutions and that likewise enhances the enrollment of white students at the state's predominately black institution,\" which is Tennessee State University (TSU) in Nashville. The agreement also is intended \"to increase the presence of other-race faculty, staff, and administrators on the campuses of the state's colleges and universities.\" Except for one 10-year funding commitment, the plan is to be implemented over five years from January 4, 2001. The agreement sets forth commitments for higher education in middle Tennessee, statewide issues in both university systems, and implementation. Major ingredients of the plan require annual appropriations for a TSU Endowment for Educational Excellence over 10 years; capital improvements and revitalization of the TSU Avon Williams Downtown Campus; consideration of merger of the Nashville School of Law with TSU; creation of new, high-demand academic programs at TSU as an alternative to the law school merger; statewide recruitment and retention initiatives for African American students, faculty, and administrators, including scholarships, pre-doctoral fellowships, visiting professorships, pre-Higher Education B-106university summer programs, and minority financial aid; and recruitment of other-race and non- traditional students to TSU. The first appropriation for the state's commitment to this settlement agreement was made in the 2001 General Appropriations Act, and administrative initiatives began in the last half of fiscal year 2000-2001. Major program initiative spending began in fiscal year 2001-2002 and continues in the current year and next year.

................................ General Public Defenders B-249State of Tennessee Law, Safety, and Correction Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004 B-195he agencies and departments which comprise this functional group are responsible for the interpretation and enforcement of the state's laws. The judicial branch of state government strives to ensure the proper administration of justice within the state and consists of the following agencies : The Court System Attorney General and Reporter District Attorneys General Conference District Public Defenders Conference Office of the Post-Conviction Defender. The public's welfare and safety are protected through confinement and control of the state's convicted adult criminal offenders. These activities are executed in the executive branch of government by the following agencies: Department of Correction Board of Probation and Parole Tennessee Corrections Institute Tennessee Rehabilitative Initiative in Correction (TRICOR). The state agencies responsible for regulation and enforcement of the law make up the remainder of the functional group. Law and order, public safety, and security are maintained through the efforts of the following agencies: Military Department Department of Safety Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Alcoholic Beverage Commission.Improvement Highlights Court System Funding of the state judges' statutory pay raise is included in the recommended budget. These salary increases are linked to the Consumer Price Index and are required by TCA 8-23-103. As a Constitutional matter, these raises must be funded during the judges' term in office. The cost of a 1.6 percent salary increase is $370,900. Also, included in the recommended budget is $4 million to provide for increased costs of indigent criminal defense and $300,000 for increased costs of the guardian ad litem program for dependent, neglected, and abused children. District Attorneys and Public Defenders An improvement of $238,600, including $208,200 from state appropriations, is recommended to annualize the fiscal year 2002-2003 step raises for assistant district attorneys and criminal investigators, based on years of service and experience. Also, the budget recommends $139,800 to annualize the fiscal year 2002-2003 step raises for assistant public defenders and criminal investigators. The raises were funded in 2002-2003 from the month of eligibility and must be annualized in the succeeding year. TCA 8-7-201, 8-7-226, 8-7-230, and 8- 14-207 required the step raises for 2002-2003. For 2003-2004, step raises are not recommended, because salary increases for other state employees are not funded. The Administration is proposing legislation to suspend the step raises for 2003-2004. Post-Conviction Defender Due to a decline of federal habeas corpus casework, the recommended budget includes $204,600 from state appropriations to fund operational requirements that are no longerB-196federally reimbursable. For the time being, the caseload has shifted to non-reimbursable issues. Department of Correction An improvement of $5 million is recommended to provide funding for an increase in the number of felons housed in local jails. Improvement funding of $14.8 million from state appropriations is recommended for two contract-monitoring positions and operational expenditures required for 1,536 inmates at the Whiteville correctional facility, under a second prison service contract with Hardeman County. The first Hardeman County incarceration agreement and the South Central Correctional Center agreement provide for inflationary increases. Improvement funding of $1.5 million is recommended for the inflationary increase of these prison service agreements. An improvement of $560,000 is recommended to provide funding for 13 nurse positions in order to eliminate the long-term overlap of two staff in one position. These positions are required in order to meet staffing standards in the geriatric unit of the Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility. Military Department To strengthen the homeland security functions of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, an improvement of $1.1 million, including $816,800 from state appropriations, is recommended. This will provide funding for one support position, emergency response equipment, andnetworked computer equipment for emergency services coordinators. The budget includes an improvement of $241,800, including $93,000 from state funds, for eight positions required to perform safety inspections and provide routine maintenance for Army and Air National Guard facilities. Department of Safety To strengthen the homeland security functions of the department, an improvement of $4.6 million is recommended. This will provide funding for security systems at driver's license stations, Highway Patrol regional offices, impound lots, and commercial vehicle weigh stations. Also, the improvement will provide funding for the replacement of one irreparable helicopter and four emergency power generators. In addition, this funding will replace one dispatch console and provide four microwave radio links to improve radio communications. The budget includes an improvement of $490,600 to provide funding for eight positions and operational expenditures required to comply with state regulations regarding the inspection of vehicles used to transport children to and from day-care facilities. An improvement of $4.1 million, from dedicated motor vehicle registration fees, is recommended to provide funding for the start- up costs of the new Titling and Registration System (TRUST).

Judicial power is vested in the various levels of courts that compose the state's court system. The court system can be grouped into the following functional areas: The Supreme Court Intermediate Appellate Courts Trial Courts Courts of limited jurisdiction Court services and support. The Supreme Court is composed of five justices; each is elected to an eight-year term. The workload of the court consists of cases appealed from lower courts. Cases may be further appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court only on grounds of federal constitutionality. Supreme Court decisions act to resolve controversies arising out of Tennessee law and to establish guidelines for the lower courts to use in future decisions. The Intermediate Appellate Courts are composed of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Court of Appeals hears appeals only in civil cases from the lower courts. The Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction to hear most felony and misdemeanor appeals from general trial courts as well as post-conviction petitions. The state's trial courts include Chancery, Criminal, Circuit and Probate Courts. Chancery Courts are the traditional equity courts used when common law and/or statutory law proves in adequate for cases. Circuit Courts, which sometimes overlap with the Chancery Courts, have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. Criminal Courts have jurisdiction over criminal cases and hearing misdemeanor appeals from lower courts. Probate Courts primarily have jurisdiction over probate of wills and administration of estates. Courts of limited jurisdiction are funded locally and include General Sessions, Juvenile and Municipal Courts. Jurisdiction of General Sessions Courts vary from county to county based on state laws and private acts; they hear civil, criminal, and juvenile cases, except in counties where the legislature has established separate Juvenile Courts. Municipal Courts have jurisdiction in cases involving violations of city ordinances.

Labor and Workforce Development ................................ ................................ ........ B-297State of Tennessee Resources and Regulation Recommended Budget, Fiscal Year 2003 - 2004 B-255he Resources and Regulation functional group includes eight agencies that promote and protect the state's natural, historical, and cultural resources and its consumers and workers. Three departments promote consumer protection and safety in the work place: Department of Commerce and Insurance Department of Financial Institutions Department of Labor and Workforce Development. These departments regulate and promote education in businesses and occupations to ensure professionalism and consumer safety; regulate insurance, commercial banking, and money-lending industries to ensure soundness and protect the interests of depositors and policy-holders; and regulate the work-place to ensure worker health and safety, fair wages, and compensation for work-related injuries. Three agencies promote and protect cultural and historical resources: Tennessee Arts Commission Tennessee State Museum Tennessee Historical Commission. Together, these agencies promote interest, education, and participation in the arts through financial support to artists and supporters of the arts; protect and preserve artifacts that are significant to our natural and cultural history; and promote the preservation of and public access to historical sites across the state through purchase and financial support. The following two agencies promote and ensure the conservation of Tennessee's agricultural, environmental, and natural resources:Department of Environment and Conservation Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. These agencies promote preservation of the state's environmental resources, protection from hazardous waste and radiation exposure, and reclamation of abandoned lands; promote recreation on public and private lands, including the state's geological, archaeological, and park resources; protect and conserve all species of wildlife native to the state; administer hunting and boating safety laws; enforce the litter control laws; stabilize river banks; and maintain drainage patterns to conserve agricultural land in West Tennessee. Improvement Highlights Department of Environment and Conservation The budget provides 26 new positions and operational costs, funded at $1.3 million from the Environmental Protection Fund, for compliance with requirements of the federal Clean Air and Clean Water acts. A regulatory fee-funded improvement of $293,200 is recommended for additional attorneys and an investigator position to handle increased workloads related to environmental regulations. Federally-funded improvements are recommended in the amounts of $107,600 for the lead-based paint program and $108,700 for the administration of water and wastewater infrastructure projects. Also inclu ded in the budget is a $500,000 state appropriation for maintenance projects of the West Tennessee River Basin Authority.B-256Wildlife Resources Agency The recommended budget provides $335,300 from Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency funds for annualization of the statutory salary increases given in 2002-2003. A statutory salary increase for wildlife personnel is not recommended for fiscal year 2003-2004, because a salary increase for other state employees is not funded in this budget. Department of Commerce and Insurance The Administration recommends $250,000 from program fees for increased audits and inspections in the state manufactured housing inspection program.Also recommended is $205,900 for the state's E-911 Emergency Communications Board, funded from dedicated taxes. This will provide three positions to strengthen auditing, to monitor and evaluate related state and federal legislation, and to improve public information about the program. The following graph depicts the manner in which funds are divided among the departments within the functional group. Funding mixes within each department vary, as some are exclusively state funded, while others represent state, federal, and other sources of funding.

This tradition continues today as the department helps expand markets for farm and forest products through promotions and industry development activities. TDA provides an array of valuable consumer services from food safety and product quality assurance to pesticide regulation and environmental monitoring. Forestry services include landowner assistance, wildfire suppression, and state forest management. Water quality programs encourage and promote wise stewardship of our natural resources. The department's mission is performed within the following four major areas: Administration and Grants Market Development Regulatory Services Forestry.

The division also monitors grant-based programs in the areas of soil conservation and water quality, pesticide pollution and abatement, commodity distribution assistance to eligible recipients, forestry incentives, and volunteer fire department assistance. Overseeing the distribution of donated surplus USDA food is also an important function of this area. The department cooperates with the National Agricultural Statistics Service to collect, analyze, and publish reliable data for producers and decision makers in agriculture. TDA administers programs to help reduce soil erosion on Tennessee farms and forestlands and to improve water quality. Through the Agricultural Resources Conservation Fund, cost-share grants are provided to farmers and other landowners who install best management practices to achieve these goals. The Tennessee Grain Indemnity Fund protects grain producers against the financial failure of a commodity dealer or warehouseman. The program is funded from interest income and grain producers' self-imposed assessments. Funds deposited in the Certified Cotton Growers Organizational Fund are used for the Boll Weevil Eradication Program. The purpose of this program is to destroy, suppress, and eradicate boll weevils. Administration also provides staff support and data management services for the Tennessee Tobacco Farmers Certifying Board.
