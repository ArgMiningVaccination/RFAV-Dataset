She found that helping her clients adapt to a healthier diet quickly led to massive improvements in their health and empowerment in the face of illness. This discovery led Pasquale to found [Urban Remedy](https://urbanremedy.com/), an organic food company that provides ready-to-eat meals, juices, cleanses, and snacks. I saw Pasquale speak recently at Create & Cultivate San Francisco and Futurewell, an incredible sustainability meets wellness summit organized by entrepreneurs Lily Riesenfeld and Meg Adelman. I spoke with Pasquale after the panels about her journey to founding Urban Remedy, how she's overcome major roadblocks along the way, and her advice for entrepreneurs. Here are highlights from our conversation: Hayley Leibson: What was your background before starting Urban Remedy? Neka Pasquale: My background is in traditional Chinese medicine. I had an acupuncture practice for over 11 years. In Chinese medicine, food is a huge part of the medicine. I loved studying all of the medicinal properties of food when I was in acupuncture school. After I was practicing for a couple years, I started to incorporate more food as medicine with my patients. I was seeing a lot of people that had chronic inflammatory issues, prediabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. People would say to me, \"I don't know what you're doing, but I've tried every drug, every specialist, and I'm still living in pain. I don't feel good.\" I would provide acupuncture, herbal therapy and supplements. I would always write out an anti-inflammatory diet recommendation and people who followed it would start feeling better. Leibson: How did you get the idea for Urban Remedy? What inspired you to create the company? Pasquale: People would come to me and say they're pre-diabetic and I would say, \"Let's get you on a low glycemic diet and eliminate sugar and processed foods.\" The real turning point for me was after I started doing retreats. I started taking my patients away for about three or four days and we had all live raw food, juices, and followed a lot of detoxification principles. I did my first retreat around 2006. People would say, \"This is the first time I feel energized. My head is clear and I feel better.\" That was really inspiring for me to see how quickly you can actually change your health. It was a way to empower people to take health into their own hands. Leibson: You went through an accelerator program in LA. How was that experience? Pasquale: I worked with a friend to write a business plan to raise $100,000 in order to build out my own little kitchen. My friend was talking to somebody in Los Angeles from [Science Inc.](https://www.science-inc.com/), an incubator out of LA. It was a very serendipitous thing. They were like, \"Oh my God, we love this space. We love what you're doing, and we want to give you a million dollars.\" At that point, I thought, \"Oh my God a million dollars. I thought that was the answer to all my problems. We could have a space!\" It's been an interesting journey since then because once I was six months pregnant with my son, I stopped my acupuncture practice because I was just so tired and needed a break. Then I was just doing Urban Remedy and ended up getting this funding. Leibson: Tell me about your early days building Urban Remedy. What was it like going from zero to one? Pasquale: I never planned to start a cleansing detox food business. It just happened out of my passion for helping people get well through food. I really believe that food is one of the most foundational pieces of our health. Eventually I thought, \"I love doing this so much, I'm going to just do it on the side.\" I started working out of a small commercial kitchen making stuff and hired a few employees. I put up a website here in Marin County where I live so that people could place orders. This was before anybody was doing juicing around here. This was right around the time that Guilt started\u2014a really high-end online shopping platform. They called me and asked if I wanted to sell a juice through them. I said yes, and it sold out within two minutes. That's when everything got kind of crazy because I didn't realize what I was getting myself into. I still had a full acupuncture practice and just became pregnant with my son. I built my first location which was a tiny kitchen in San Rafael. That was a whole experience because I had no background in finance or anything like that. So I was doing procurement, HR, making recipes, figuring out how to work with contractors\u2014it was a total insane time of my life. Then a publisher called me and asked if I would write a book so I was also writing a book at the same time. I also got divorced around that time. It was just total mayhem and crazy chaos. Leibson: Where is Urban Remedy now? Pasquale: That first year we were doing a lot of online sales, and now we have 17 brick and mortar stores. We have our own little kiosks in Whole Foods, and we're in other high-end markets. We're also in hospitals. We just launched in New York a couple months ago so that's super exciting for us. I never dreamed we would be in New York. Leibson: How did you deal with obstacles while building Urban Remedy? Pasquale: I always had a drive and passion for what I was doing. I knew what I was doing was what I was meant to be doing. There were a lot of obstacles along the way. For example, I hired somebody and they ended up being terrible, not doing their job, and stealing money. There were so many little things that would happen, but I always thought to myself, \"Okay, there are these roadblocks happening. I've got to get through these roadblocks. I used every single one as a learning experience instead of trying to fight everything all the time and becoming frustrated.\" At the beginning of Urban Remedy, I was going to partner with a really famous raw food chef and we signed the lease on the first place together. Last minute she pulled out. I remember thinking, \"Oh my God, now I'm going to have to do this alone. If I fail or if this doesn't work\u2014then it's all me. I was so scared to take this leap. I needed to come up with all this money and do all of these things. So you have to push through that and let go and think, 'Well if I don't try, I'll never know.'\" Leibson: Any additional advice for founders? Pasquale: If you're creating a business because you want to make a lot of money, or you're doing something because you think it's a cool trend, that's okay. However, there's a difference when you're doing something that you're really passionate about\u2014when you're living your truth and you feel like it's what you're meant to be doing. "}
