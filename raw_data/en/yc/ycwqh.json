I see something far more serious. Be. Cautious.", "sitename": "Vital Animal\u00ae \u00a7 The Natural Path", "date": "2013-12-15", "cleaned_text": "You Want to Detox a Vaccination? Think Again. I was inspired by a Facebook post that I was recently tagged in: A friend is being forced to take the MMR vaccine at work. What can he do in order to detox from it? He'll loose his hospital job if he does not take it. Suggestions? First, being forced to take a vaccination is just plain wrong, by any institution anywhere. But that's the subject of a very different blog post, under the heading of basic human rights. More significant for now is the word \"detox.\" It's a common idea: vaccines have mercury and heavy metals in them quite often, and if we could just detoxify the body receiving the vaccination, that body would be restored to normal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Something far more insidious happens when we subject someone, be they a person, dog, cat, horse, ferret, what ever the species, to a vaccine jab. We are setting up a state of chronic disease, often a close variation of the disease we are hoping to avoid, in the patient who gets vaccinated. This chronic disease can last for years if not life, and can set up the animal or person for a life of misery, forced to respond to this new disease. The overall term for this disease is vaccinosis, and it can take many forms. History Speaks. Loudly. Interestingly, this disease was recognized long before heavy metals were used in vaccines. The term goes back to one Dr. J. Compton Burnett, a British physician who was a critical observer of illness, practicing medicine in Britain in the late 1800's. His book, Vaccinosis and Its Cure by Thuja was published in 1884. It's a very small but potent book that [you can find on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2XbsA7n). Well worth your time and the few bucks it costs. In his book, Dr. Burnett wrote about his patients who were made ill, often extremely ill, after they received vaccination for smallpox, the first vaccine widely used in the world. Again, no heavy metals were in it. His many case examples include: - a dying baby (whose wet nurse was recently vaccinated, not him!) - skin eruptions - neuralgia (her pain was at the back of her eyes) of 20 years duration (!) who came to him, \"in utter despair.\" - chronic headache of nine years duration - chronic colds and headaches of three months duration - spinal pain (\"bent forward, could scarcely walk\") - chronic ringworm, whose cure was \"barred\" by vaccinosis An interesting side point Dr. Burnett observed was this: the vaccinated patients who were most ill were the ones that \"didn't take.\" In those days, cow pox vaccine was given by injection, and it was considered successful when an eruption of pustules was the outcome. The understanding was these folks would be immune to small pox, a close relative of cow pox. Those who were so vaccinated but failed to make the pustules were deemed to be non-responders, who \"didn't take,\" i.e. mount a reaction to the injected foreign material. My Patients Don't Get Sick After Vaccination \u2014 Dr. WhiteCoat Oh Really? How Long Did You Watch? Now think for a moment: how many animals get vaccinated and show no illness what so ever immediately afterwards? No fever, no loss of appetite, no skin itch, no odd behavior. But then, a few weeks to a month later, they start to itch or convulse or have ear infections, aggression, ADD, etc. I think this is the norm, and why short sighted views on vaccination deem it \"safe.\" When illness follows, it's often long enough after vaccination that the event is forgotten or negated as being causative. Until the questions are directed to \"when did this illness begin?\" A British vet discovered, by asking this very question of his clients, that 75% of his respondents answered that their dogs [started itching about a month after their vaccines](https://vitalanimal.com/vaccination-safety/). What's This Vaccinosis Look Like? Dr. Richard Pitcairn, the vet who taught many of us homeopathy, wrote about the relationship between vaccination and the chronic disease it induces [here](http://www.drpitcairn.com/lectures-and-talks/new-look-at-vaccines/), in a paper presented at the [AHVMA](https://www.ahvma.org/) conference in 1993. It's a remarkable treatise on how dogs vaccinated against distemper or rabies often develop chronic symptoms of either or both diseases. Here's his chart showing the natural symptoms of canine distemper compared to what we commonly see as symptoms in chronically ill dogs. Here's a chart comparing the symptoms of rabies to the common behaviors we see in dogs who are chronically unwell. Cats vaccinated against feline distemper develop similar chronic disease to what a prolonged case of panleukopenia would look like, if it were \"stretched out\" into a chronic form. That chart is in the paper referenced above. So, Should You \"Detox\" That Vaccine, Then? Detoxing heavy metals post vaccination may help, but you can surmise it won't help to a great extent, as vaccinosis is clearly much deeper than intoxication. Nor will vaccinosis be addressed by any type of bodily cleanse. It's an energetic disturbance. While Dr. Burnett found thuja to be extremely helpful in vaccinated patients, thuja is, like most of homeopathy, rarely a \"one size fits all\" remedy. We have a group of remedies known as \"vaccinosis remedies,\" including silica, sulphur, mezereum, apis, sarsaparilla, etc. Curing the vaccinosis state, like curing any chronic disease state, takes careful recognition of the patient's symptoms, indicating how he is not well, and matching that ill state to a remedy capable of causing such a state, if it were taken in crude doses repeatedly. Those who've joined our [Vital Animal Alpha](https://vitalanimal.com/join-alpha/) group, will recognize this language from the live lessons we've had (saved in video & audio files for your review when you join Alpha. Care to learn animal homeopathy with us?). We don't look for a \"parvo remedy,\" we look for a remedy that matches the state of illness your animal is portraying by observing his symptoms. What Can You Do for Your Already Vaccinated Animal? The best idea is to get on board with a [veterinary homeopath](https://theavh.org/) of your choosing and get the chronic illness cured, once and for all. It'll be a process, but a very rewarding one. (Special note: if you don't have a mostly homeopathic practitioner near you, it doesn't matter. Search for one who works by telephone. I've got a video to guide you on this on my [Recommended Resources](http://vitalanimal.com/recommended-resources/) page.) Here's an example from this week's cases. Loma, a 3 year old Shepherd/Pit Bull cross, came up from Houston, and was immediately noted to have a very coarse coat, as well as a history of urinary tract disease and a profound dislike of getting wet. Her guardian's words the day after I treated her: \"Loma's coat is SOFT literally overnight and she is peeing no problem (taking her off the herbs so we see the real scoop). I did a few doubletakes/feels of her coat and it is just RICH and soft. How in the world did one dose of Thuja affect her coat in hours?? What does that indicate other than the right remedy? is her vitality coming up that fast?\" Yes. And it indicates that a significant part of Loma's illness was due to being vaccinated. How many times had she been vaccinated? TWICE in her life. Next, with your homeopath's help, get off the vaccination merry go round. \"Once and done\" is the way to go, not repeating those shots annually or every three years, which clearly [does not even work](https://vitalanimal.com/vaccination-efficacy/). It'll also help to [boost your vaccinated animal's immunity](https://vitalanimal.com/immunity-left-to-chance-fails/). It's the immune system that's usually at the heart of vaccinosis. Allergies, ear infections, hypothyroidism, tumors \u2014 these all reflect immune problems. Search this site in the box in the right column of any article for the word \"vaccination\" so you can really be a wise consumer and prevent vaccinosis as much as possible. And, learn from Loma's case: it doesn't take lots of vaccinations to get unwell. Dr. Burnett saw this, too. One or two vaccines could undo a patient's health for a very long time. Updated: You can now ALSO detox! I originally wrote this material before I met Dr. Scott Treadway, natural formulator extraordinaire. We met in the newly formed Vital Pet Health, where I advise now. Scott has a long history of working with detox for people and he formulated an amazing supplement for VPH called [Vital Animal Detox](https://vitalanimal.com/go/vad/). I liked the sounds of it, but I probably wouldn't have been completely sold on it until Scott gave me a human version to try. When I was on it daily for only about 4-5 days, my whole body felt significantly different! - Less stiff on waking every morning - Clearer in my vision (less floaters? less foggy) - More able to think clearly - My digestion seems much more \"settled\" and efficient (great stools!) - Somehow, there's just more energy. (Is that because my sleep is better or I'm just carrying around less crud? I don't know, but I'm liking it!) So, while I still highly recommend getting that deep healing that only a professional veterinary homeopath can offer, I'm now recommending ALSO using a daily detox. Vaccines are a toxic mess (aluminum, mercury, antibiotics, preservatives, etc.) and our world is inundated with foreign chemicals. Vital Animal Detox is 100% natural and free of all man-made chemicals. Thanks. Dr. Treadway! Photo courtesy of "}
