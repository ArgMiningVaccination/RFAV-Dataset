Our C-section recovery guide will help you prepare for side effects, scar care, and everything in between. By Alesandra Dubin Updated on July 26, 2023 Medically reviewed by Lulu Zhao, M.D. About one-third of all babies are born via Cesarean section in the United States today, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet a C-section delivery\u2014and the recovery that follows\u2014is not covered in much depth in many childbirth classes, if at all. As parents can attest, it's not easy to recover from a C-section with a newborn while also dealing with postpartum body changes. That's why we rounded up a week-by-week C-section recovery timeline with milestones and guidelines you should know. We also give C-section aftercare tips to promote speedy healing. Keep in mind that while everyone has a different Cesarean experience, most people fully recover in about six weeks. C-Section Recovery Timeline You'll start feeling better in the days after a C-section procedure, but complete recovery takes several weeks. Here's what you can expect. Day of the C-Section Immediately after surgery, you'll move to a post-operative area (if your birthing location has one) where you'll remain under observation, with hospital staff monitoring things like bleeding (from your vagina and incision), blood pressure, and temperature. An IV will deliver fluids and a catheter will help empty your bladder, as the effects of anesthesia will not have worn off yet to enable you to urinate on your own. At this point, you still won't have sensation in your lower body because of the anesthesia, and you may feel a bit shaky and woozy if you received pain medicine in your IV. The good news: Barring complications, you'll be able to hold (and nurse, if you choose) your baby right away. If there aren't any complications, your medical team will continue monitoring you for a few hours as your anesthesia wears off. You can start to eat, but will be encouraged to progress slowly from ice chips to liquids (think broth and juice) before moving to solids. Following your surgery, nurses will massage your uterus to encourage it to contract and shrink to its normal size. (Sadly, this isn't as soothing and spa-like as it sounds.) Depending on the hospital, you might encouraged to get out of your bed, if possible, on the same day. Yes, you just had major abdominal surgery, but the activity will help speed up your C-section healing. All You Need To Know About Having a C-Section Getty Images / Westend61 One Day After C-Section C-section pain typically spikes 18 hours after delivery. \"That's when the pain medication you were given with your spinal anesthesia wears off,\" says San Diego perinatologist Sean Daneshmand, MD. At that point, you'll be given an oral narcotic\u2014or you may have \"patient-controlled analgesia,\" in which pain medication is delivered through your IV on your own schedule. If your urinary catheter is not out yet, medical staff will remove it the day after your C-section. After this, you will be encouraged to get out of your bed, as this will help your bowels start moving quicker and prevent gravity-related swelling from building up in your legs. Don't hesitate to ask for assistance as you've just had major abdominal surgery! You might be given a blood thinner (usually a subcutaneous shot called Lovenox) to prevent blood clots after surgery. Two Days After C-Section \"After the first day, we recommend increasing activity as rapidly as possible, but do recognize that this may cause C-section pain,\" says Aaron B. Caughey, MD, a former member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) committee on obstetrics practice. \"Increased physical activity helps with circulation, improves bowel function, and will get you back to baseline sooner.\" The Different Reasons for Planned and Emergency C-Sections You also can shower within a day of your surgery, and doing so helps reduce the risk of infection. Don't scrub your incision, but let the soapy water run over it. (Your bandages will be removed 24-48 hours after surgery and might replaced with small sticky bandages called Steri-Strips; it's fine if these get wet.) Dry the area by gently patting it or using a blow-dryer set on cool. Prefer to take a bath after a C-section? Unfortunately, submerging yourself in water is only safe once the incision has healed, which is generally seven to 10 days after surgery. At this point in your C-section recovery timeline, you'll be wearing a pad for postpartum vaginal bleeding, which may last several weeks following delivery. (Yes, even after a C-section!) This totally normal discharge is called lochia, and it's a combination of leftover blood, mucus, and uterine tissue. By this point, if not earlier, you're likely eating solid food. Swelling after a C-section is completely normal, and gas pains can be excruciating. They should pass within a week, once your bowels are moving normally again (abdominal surgery causes them to \"shut down\" temporarily, so pooping after a C-section might not come easy). In the meantime, taking anti-gas medication and a stool softener will help\u2014and so will walking around. If you can't walk long distances yet, ask your nurse if you can rock in the glider in your room; sometimes the rocking motion can help relieve built-up gas too. Also, use of an abdominal binder can with post-op pain and may enable you to move around better. Your physician might recommend taking simethicone tablets (such as Gas-X), which can help alleviate gas and bloating. C-Section Scar Care: Your Guide to Helping It Heal How Long Will I Stay in the Hospital After a C-Section? People who give birth vaginally might stay in the hospital for one or two days, but those who had a C-section typically stay two to four days, barring any complications. After this, your C-section recovery timeline will continue at home. Four Days After C-Section Although parents who give birth vaginally generally stay in the hospital for one or two days, with a C-section, you may stay two to four days. Of course, the length of your hospital stay will be dependent on your insurance coverage and barring any complications. Before you leave, your doctor will remove your staples if you have them (sutures will dissolve on their own). You'll be advised on caring for your incision; keeping the wound clean and undisturbed is your best course. \"There have not been any good scientific studies demonstrating that any of the over-the-counter preparations are better than just proper wound care,\" says Rajiv B. Gala, MD, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' young physician at large. You'll also be instructed not to lift anything heavier than your baby, and to avoid anything in the vagina, including penetrative sex (both partnered or solo), menstrual products, and douche products (which should generally be avoided regardless) until after your six-week check-up. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends not placing anything in the vagina for a few weeks to prevent infection. Driving right after a C-section is a no-no in certain situations, and so is taking the stairs if it's uncomfortable. You might recruit a partner to move your essentials downstairs if you have a multi-story home\u2014or, at the very least, limit your trips so that you climb stairs only when it's essential. What Are the Signs of Infection After a C-Section? Week Two of C-Section Recovery You'll see your doctor again for a postpartum check-up to examine your incision, which should not show excessive swelling after C-section, redness, or signs of infection. (If you see these signs, or are running a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, call your doctor.) Discuss any concerns you have, and ask for an update on recommendations regarding activity. Although you're only two weeks out from a major abdominal surgery, you should expect to feel tremendously better by this stage. But keep in mind that you'll feel C-section pain and cramping for several weeks. \"Whether you delivered vaginally or by C-section, it takes six weeks for the uterus to contract to its normal size,\" says Dr. Daneshmand. Resting a heating pad or hot-water bottle on your belly can help\u2014and so can over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen. You can still expect to look pregnant at this stage (and much longer, for many people) due to laxity of the abdominal wall. Pregnancy After C-Section: How Long to Wait for Conception Week Four of C-Section Recovery At this point during your C-section healing journey, you'll be moving more swiftly and comfortably, taking longer walks, and noticing your bleeding taper off. But keep your expectations in check. \"Don't compare your recovery to someone else's because our recoveries vary as much as our genetics, and comparisons will only frustrate those who take a bit longer to recover,\" says Shawn Tassone, MD, an Austin, Texas-based OB-GYN and author of the books Hands Off My Belly! and Spiritual Pregnancy. \"Listen to your body, and if things hurt, slow down; if you feel tired, rest as much as you can. And it's OK to take the pain medications prescribed to you by your provider.\" Week Six of C-Section Recovery Good news: Your initial primary healing is done. \"Full recovery from an uncomplicated Cesarean section can range between four and six weeks,\" says Dr. Gala, who notes, \"The healthier you are before surgery, the quicker the recovery.\" How Many C-Sections Is 'Too Many'? At this point, Dr. Tassone says, most of your sutures, if you had them, will have been about 50% absorbed, your uterus will be back down to its normal size, and you'll be free to have penetrative sex. \"Some people may still have pain if they're bumped along the incision, but for the most part the wound is perfectly healed at this point, and you can resume all normal activities,\" he says. Of course, there is still a lot of healing that goes on in your body in the postpartum stage, so be sure to take it easy, rest often, and listen to your body as you adjust to your new life as a parent. And as a general rule of thumb, if at any point in the postpartum process you start to feel worse, not better, call your doctor. You should never suffer in silence, and help is always a phone call away. Tips for C-Section Recovery While you may be eager to jump into your new parenting role, keep in mind that you just had major abdominal surgery. These tips can help you feel better faster. Listen to your doctor's orders. Your health care provider will inform you about C-section recovery tips, which generally include the following: Don't take a bath or go swimming until your incision has healed (about seven to 10 days after surgery) Keep the C-section incision clean and undisturbed Don't lift anything heavier than your baby until after your six-week check-up Avoid putting anything in the vagina (including menstrual products and penetrative sex) until you get your doctor's go-ahead Don't drive until you get the green light (usually when you're feeling better and off of prescription medications, about two to three weeks after surgery) Avoid stairs if they're uncomfortable Choose comfortable breastfeeding positions Take pain medication. Ask your provider about the best way to reduce C-section pain. They might give you a prescription painkiller or suggest over-the-counter options. Stool softeners, lidocaine patches (for your incision), heating pads, and ice can also help. Eat nutritious foods. Not only does a healthy diet fuel your body, it also prevents a common C-section complication: constipation. What's more, if you're breastfeeding, eating right will ensure your newborn is getting nutrients too. Try light physical activity. After a C-section surgery, walking is important to prevent blood clots, and it also promotes quicker recovery. Ask your doctor about incorporating walking into your week-by-week C-section recovery plan. Avoid lifting weights or doing other strenuous activities.Ask for help. Recruit your partner, friends, and family members to help with household responsibilities (like laundry and cooking) while you recover. You can also hire someone to assist you. Limit visitors. Everyone wants to visit your newborn, but it's completely fine to limit visitors while you focus on recovery. Why Doctors Perform C-Sections for Babies in Breech When to Call the Doctor On rare occasions, people can experience complications after a C-section. If you have the following symptoms, or any other worrisome health concerns, contact your provider right away (don't wait for your next postpartum check-up): The incision is warm, red, oozing, or swollen (this could signal infection)Painful urinationHeavy vaginal bleeding that doesn't let up Abdominal pain that's new or worseningPain that's not relieved by medicationFever higher than 100.4 degrees FahrenheitPain, tenderness, warmth, or swelling in one leg, particularly the calf muscle (this can signal a blood clot)Difficulty breathing or chest painSwelling in the hands, eyes, or faceSudden weight gainVision changesFour-smelling vaginal dischargeBody achesSwelling and redness of a breastFeelings of sadness, depression, or wanting to harm yourself or your newborn Was this page helpful?
