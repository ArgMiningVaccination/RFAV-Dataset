When administered in time, these drugs can work miracles, dissolving life-threatening blockages and reducing the incidence of stroke-related disability in up to half of all cases. Patients suffering from hemorrhagic strokes caused by broken arteries that bleed into the brain must have emergency surgery to survive. Delaying care. Despite the urgency of treatment, more than half of all stroke patients don't seek help until hours\u2014and sometimes days\u2014have passed. One of the reasons they postpone care is that they're unfamiliar with the warning signs of a brain attack (see box below). \"Because stroke symptoms may come and go over a period of hours before hitting with full intensity, many stroke victims delay getting help,\" says Jain. Meanwhile, 1.9 million cells are dying each minute in the area of the brain affected by the stroke. \"The rapid destruction of brain cells creates a short treatment window when patients arrive in the emergency room,\" says Dr. Steven Cramer, a UC Irvine Healthcare stroke neurologist. In an effort to speed up the care of stroke patients, Cramer led the effort to establish a system of stroke-neurology receiving centers in Orange County. \"The network ensures that stroke patients are transported by EMTs and paramedics to hospitals equipped and staffed 24 hours a day to provide the most advanced treatment,\" says Cramer. To qualify as a stroke-neurology receiving center, hospitals must have a dedicated medical director and round-the-clock emergency physicians, neurologists, neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists. They must also be equipped and staffed for MRI and CT testing at all times. UC Irvine Medical Center was among the first of six hospitals designated by the Orange County Health Agency as a stroke-neurology receiving center\u2014and the first Joint Commission-certified Primary Stroke Center in the area. \"We treat a stroke with the same urgency as a heart attack,\" says neurologist Dr. Lama Al-Khoury, the newest addition to the stroke team. Once the patient is stabilized, the stroke team conducts an evaluation, including brain scans. Emergency surgery is performed for hemorrhagic stroke patients. Clot-busting drugs are administered to ischemic stroke patients if their symptoms began within the three-hour time limit. Extending the timeline. Whenever possible, the UC Irvine stroke team uses new approaches to extend the treatment timeline, including the direct application of medication to the clot through a catheter. \"This increases the treatment window for clot-busting drugs to six hours,\" says Jain. A catheter-based device called the Merci Retriever \u00ae is sometimes used to remove blood clots from the brains of patients. Another tool called the Penumbra System \u00ae may also be used to break up and suction away stubborn clots through a catheter. But all the technology in the world won't help if people don't seek immediate care when they suspect a stroke in themselves or others. \"Don't wait for symptoms to improve or worsen,\" says Jain. \"Call 911 immediately.\" For information on the UC Irvine Stroke & Cerebrovascular Center, visit www.ucihealth.com/stroke.STROKE FACTS Timing. It often determines whether a stroke victim will resume a normal life, suffer serious disabilities\u2014or survive. STROKE SIGNS Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Brief loss of consciousness Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause 2 Twenty feet long, it extends from the mouth to the anus and includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, liver, pancreas and bile ducts. Each plays a distinct role in digestion, making the gastrointestinal (GI) system one of the most intricate in the body. It's also among the most vulnerable to cancer. A consolidated attack. \"Each year, 20 percent of all newly diagnosed cancers involve some type of gastrointestinal malignancy,\" says Dr. Kenneth Chang, director of the H.H. Chao Comprehensive Digestive Disease Center (CDDC) at University of California, Irvine Medical Center. \"Each of these cancers is complex and unique, requiring highly specialized care.\" Interfacing with the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, the CDDC embodies the team approach to treatment, drawing together highly trained physicians from a multitude of disciplines. From diagnosis through treatment, all combine their expertise to ensure an integrated treatment plan specifically tailored for each patient. The result is a vigorous, consolidated attack on the disease. This spirit of teamwork has fostered an environment in which innovation is encouraged. This has resulted in the development of new ways to diagnose and treat GI cancers, including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) . EUS involves the use of a slender tube equipped to emit soundwaves and tipped with a light and video camera. The tube is introduced through the mouth or rectum and guided along the GI tract to detect cancer and other abnormalities. \"EUS is a kinder and gentler diagnostic method than exploratory surgery, which was the norm only a few years ago,\" says Chang, who pioneered the use of this method for diagnostic and treatment purposes. \"During EUS, cell samples can be taken, saving patients the additional stress of having a surgical biopsy at a later time.\" Easier treatments. CDDC doctors have also championed several nonsurgical methods to treat GI cancer. Among them is photodynamic therapy, a procedure that combines a light-sensitive drug with laser energy to destroy cancer cells in targeted areas of the esophagus. Another treatment is radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This method uses an electric current to treat Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition that can result from long-term acid reflux. RFA is also effective against tumors in the liver. An additional treatment for liver cancer involves radioactive microspheres\u2014 tiny plastic beads\u2014that are delivered through a catheter to the blood supplying the tumor. The result is radiotherapy that's much more precise than radiation from an external source. A single incision. Several minimally invasive methods for the surgical treatment of GI cancers have also been developed by CDDC specialists. Dr. David Imagawa, a UC Irvine Healthcare hepatobiliary and pancreas surgeon was among the first in the world to use laparoscopic techniques to operate on patients with pancreatic cancer. Additionally, leading-edge approaches for colorectal cancer have been developed at UC Irvine Medical Center, helping to usher in an era of scarless surgery. These same approaches have transformed the way surgery for gallbladder cancer is performed. \"Today, we can operate on the gallbladder and stomach through a single, tiny incision hidden in the belly button,\" says Dr. Ninh Nguyen, a gastrointestinal surgeon. A nationally acknowledged expert in minimally invasive surgery, Nguyen played a leading role in this long-awaited breakthrough. Radiation and chemotherapy\u2014both strengths of UC Irvine Medical Center\u2014often precede or follow surgery. UC Irvine Healthcare also participates in dozens of clinical trials. \"This offers patients access to cancer-fighting drugs before they're available elsewhere,\" says Chang. \"Our focus is providing the comprehensive, leading-edge care patients need, even if they're suffering from rare or difficult-to-treat forms of gastrointestinal cancer.\" For a referral to a UC Irvine Healthcare gastrointestinal specialist, call 888.717.GIMD.Gastrointestinal Cancer The gastrointestinal system is a marvel of construction. www.ucihealth.comTwenty percent of all newly diagnosed cancers affect the gastrointestinal system. 3 Fighting Colorectal Cancer Toll free 877.UCI.DOCSThe bad news is that about 57,000 people are expected to die this year from the disease, which is one of the most preventable of all cancers. \"This type of malignancy typically begins as a small, benign growth in the lining of the colon,\" says Dr. Steven Mills, a UC Irvine Healthcare colorectal surgeon. Over a period of five to 10 years these growths, called polyps, can become cancerous. A colonoscopy\u2014a procedure that uses a lighted, flexible tube to examine the inner lining of the rectum and colon\u2014can detect polyps. \"These growths can be removed simply and painlessly during the exam, stopping cancer in its tracks.\" The gold standard. For people who aren't tested, however, colorectal polyps may develop for years until they become malignant. At this point, the key to survival is highly specialized surgical treatment, often supplemented by radiation and chemotherapy. Specialists at the H.H. Chao Comprehensive Digestive Disease Center at University of California, Irvine Medical Center are nationally recognized experts in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Particularly challenging are cancers affecting the rectum. The gold standard for rectal cancer surgery is a procedure known as total mesorectal excision (TME). Until recently, this operation was always performed using conventional methods. But now Mills and colleague Dr. Michael Stamos are among only a small number of colorectal surgeons in the United States with enough experience to perform TME using minimally invasive techniques. \"For patients, a laparoscopic (minimally invasive) TME results in less blood loss, decreased pain, a shorter hospitalization and a faster return to normal activities,\" says Mills. T echnically challenging. Considered one of the most technically challenging operations performed for any type of cancer, laparoscopic TME requires superb surgical skills. Not only must surgeons work within the tight confines of the pelvic bones, but they also must avoid the tiny nerves governing sexual, bladder and bowel functions that are also located in this cramped space. During the procedure, the surgeon removes the cancerous portion of the rectum, as well as involved lymph nodes and blood vessels. \"Special care is given to preserving the anal sphincter\u2014the ring of muscles that governs bowel control,\" says Mills. \"If the sphincter is damaged, it can lead to a permanent colostomy.\" This life-altering procedure involves a surgical opening in the abdomen that allows waste to pass out of the body into a bag. \"Advanced techniques are used to protect pelvic nerves, resulting in a high preservation rate for bowel, urinary and sexual function,\" says Mills. \"TME reduces the recurrence of local rectal cancer to under 10 percent.\" At UC Irvine Medical Center, about 40 percent of cases involving the partial or complete removal of the colon and affected lymph nodes are now performed through a single, small incision hidden deep within the navel, making the procedure virtually scarless. The new approach has a significant learning curve and requires extensive experience. For this reason, it is only available at select medical institutions across the United States. Radiation and chemotherapy also play critical roles in the care of colorectal patients. Individuals with this disease have ready access to a team of nationally renowned experts housed at the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"Quality of life is a major focus of the colorectal program,\" says Mills. \"From diagnosis through treatment, our goal is to achieve a high cure rate. At the same time, we want to attain outcomes that provide our patients with a good body image so they can look forward with confidence to the rest of their lives.\" For referral to a UC Irvine Healthcare colorectal surgeon, call 888.717.GIMD.The good news is that deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States are dropping about 2 percent annually. Treatment for colorectal cancer requires superb surgical skills and many years of experience. 4 Each new office, each new setting can be an anxiety-provoking experience, adding immeasurably to an already trying situation. The new Cardiovascular Center at University of California, Irvine Medical Center is designed to make the diagnosis and treatment of heart and blood vessel disease a kinder and gentler experience for patients and their families. \"The new facility is a 'one-stop' destination for people with even the most complex conditions,\" says Dr. Jagat Narula, co-director of the Cardiovascular Center and world-renowned cardiac imaging expert. The center houses a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, vascular surgeons and others. They work side by side to provide optimal patient care. High-risk patients. The team is further strengthened by ready access to the most modern methods available for the diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions. This includes a number of leading-edge, noninvasive imaging tests such as 64-slice 3-D echocardiography, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography (PET scans). Also available is infrared optical imaging, a sophisticated invasive test to assess heart health. \"As a university-based hospital, UC Irvine Medical Center treats a high percentage of patients with complex cardiovascular conditions, including extensive coronary artery disease, serious valve disorders, rhythm disturbances, vascular problems and advanced heart failure,\" says cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Milliken, co-director of the Cardiovascular Center. By locating a full range of cardiovascular services in a consolidated area, communication among the center's integrated team of specialists is streamlined. This helps doctors address each patient's needs in a comprehensive manner\u2014one of the many reasons that UC Irvine Medical Center surpasses national standards in the treatment of high-risk cardiac surgery patients. Milliken and other UC Irvine Healthcare cardiothoracic surgeons perform coronary bypass surgery and other procedures in state-of-the-art operating rooms at UC Irvine Douglas Hospital, just steps away from the Cardiovascular Center. Angioplasty, stenting and a host of other interventional procedures are performed in two adjacent state-of-the-art cardiac catheterization labs. Peripheral vascular disease is also a major focus of the new center. \"The health of the peripheral circulatory system and the heart is closely related since both involve the same disease processes,\" says vascular surgeon Dr. Roy Fujitani, Cardiovascular Center co-director. Hardening of the arteries can lead to leg pain during physical activity, gangrene and wounds that won't heal. Other problems such as carotid artery disease and aortic aneurysms\u2014potentially life-threatening bulges in the wall of the body's major blood vessel\u2014are also common vascular problems that often go undiagnosed. A full range of testing for vascular conditions is available at the new center, including noninvasive ultrasonography and 3-D interactive imaging. Treatment may involve one or more therapies such as medication, minimally invasive procedures and conventional surgery. An ideal environment. \"By bringing together experts in all areas of cardiovascular care, the combined experience of the individuals on the team becomes greater than the sum of its parts,\" says Narula. \"This creates an ideal environment in which cardiovascular patients can receive highly integrated, state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment services.\" For more information on the UC Irvine Cardiovascular Center, visit www.ucihealth.com/heart.

Mark Vuchinich, a UC Irvine Healthcare obstetrician-gynecologist. \"Furthermore, nine out of 10 women have repeat cesareans, even though a successful VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) is safer for most women than a planned C-section, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\" or ACOG. To counteract this trend, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has set a goal of increasing the VBAC rate to 63 percent. \"VBAC offers women many benefits, including more active involvement in the birth, immediate bonding with the baby and a shorter hospital stay,\" says Vuchinich. \"The incidence of serious blood loss or infection is also reduced, leading to a faster recovery.\" Safety first. With all these advantages, why has the number of cesarean patients who opt for VBAC declined from more than 28 percent in 1996 to about 9 percent today? The most influential factor has been the revised VBAC safety guidelines issued by ACOG in 1999. The organization stated that doctors, operating room staff and anesthesiologists had to be available immediately to perform an emergency C-section if a VBAC patient's \"trial of labor\" resulted in fetal distress or a problem for the mother. \"According to ACOG, many hospitals determined they couldn't meet these guidelines and stopped offering VBAC,\" says Vuchinich, who points out that few hospitals in Orange County routinely provide this birth option. At University of California, Irvine Medical Center, an obstetrician is available 24 hours a day to monitor each VBAC patient and fetus. If a problem is noted in either, the hospital is equipped and staffed to perform a C-section without delay. This is made possible by the round-the-clock presence of anesthesiologists, neonatologists and other key personnel. \"One of the concerns when considering VBAC is the possibility of uterine rupture, which occurs in about 0.7 percent of patients,\" says Vuchinich. For this reason, he doesn't recommend VBAC for women who have had two or more cesareans. What determines if a woman is a good candidate for VBAC? \"Most important is the type of cesarean incision she had,\" says Vuchinich. \"Low transverse incisions\u2014those made sideways across the lower part of the uterus\u2014ensure the greatest success.\" Previous vaginal deliveries also contribute to the potential success of VBAC. Further, the current pregnancy should be progressing normally, and the baby should be in a head-down position and not excessively large. In addition, any factors contributing to the previous C-section should not be present, and labor should start spontaneously. Larger families. \"Women who want to have a larger family can especially benefit from VBAC,\" says Vuchinich. \"The more cesareans a woman has, the greater the risk of developing placenta acreta, a condition in which there's an abnormally deep attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall.\" This is an obstetrical emergency that not only puts the fetus at risk, but also can result in a hysterectomy to stop placenta-related bleeding. Even though patients are carefully screened, it's still difficult to know if they will be able to give birth vaginally until labor begins. \"Every birth is different, and the labor and delivery process has many variables,\" says Vuchinich. For this reason, it's understood that a \"trial of labor\"\u2014experiencing contractions long enough to determine if vaginal birth is a safe option\u2014is a necessary step in the VBAC experience. \"Even though it's impossible to guarantee that a previous C-section patient will be able to deliver vaginally, there are so many benefits with VBAC that many women feel it's well worth the effort. At UC Irvine Medical Center, most women attempting VBAC experience a successful vaginal delivery.\" For a referral to a physician specializing in VBAC, call 714.456.2911.Once a cesarean, always a cesarean. For many years, this was the rule of thumb for women who had C-sections. VBAC offers women many benefits, including an active involvement in their baby's birth. 6 Seniors: Ask the Doctor Staying Active Regular physical activity is important for seniors\u2014winter or summer. But what should you do if you haven't exercised in a while and want to get back on track? Join us as Dr. Shahira Khoury, a UC Irvine Healthcare physical medicine and rehabilitation physician, discusses the importance of exercise for seniors and strategies to keep moving. Why is exercise important for seniors? Studies show that regular physical activity reduces the risks for heart attack, blood vessel disease, stroke, diabetes, depression, obesity, osteoporosis and dementia. The improved strength and stamina resulting from frequent physical activity can also lead to greater independence for seniors. In fact, if exercise were available in pill form, it would be considered a wonder drug. How can I keep active during the winter? If you're already exercising regularly, mall walking or swimming in an indoor pool are great ways to stay active during the winter months. Exercise classes offered at community centers and gyms are also a good choice. People can also reap the benefits of exercise through everyday activities such as playing with their grandchildren, doing housework and climbing stairs. If I haven't exercised in a while, how can I begin again? Start by talking with your doctor. Once cleared for exercise, you should set realistic goals and plan a time each day to exercise. It's essential to select an activity that's not only enjoyable and affordable, but also realistic and safe. For example, people with knee problems shouldn't jog, but they can usually walk at a safe pace, even if they need a walker or cane. No matter what you choose, it's important to concentrate not on your limitations, but on your abilities. And remember\u2014more is not always better. Start at a pace you can handle and increase your program in small increments. What preparations are necessary? You should select shoes that offer proper support for the activity you've chosen and wear safety equipment such as a helmet if you're riding a bike. You should also use sunscreen even in the winter and be sure your diet is healthy. It all goes hand in hand. What's more important\u2014 aerobics, strength training or stretching? Each plays an important role in keeping people fit. Aerobic exercise, including walking and swimming, increases cardiovascular function. Strength training builds muscles and improves bone mass and balance through the use of weights, machines, resistance bands and the weight of your own body. Stretching increases flexibility and alleviates stiffness. Yoga and Pilates are good stretching activities. They also help protect the back by strengthening core muscles. Can people with mobility problems exercise? Yes. There's a type of exercise for almost everyone, no matter how frail or inactive a person may be. People with limited ability may have to proceed more carefully than others\u2014and work with a personal trainer or specialized physical therapist\u2014but they can still reap the rewards of exercise.

A pioneer in the use of laparoscopic operations, Nguyen performs gallbladder, appendix and bariatric (weight-loss) procedures using LESS methods. As a result, patients experience reduced pain and a faster recovery while avoiding visible postoperative scarring. They also have a decreased risk for postoperative hernias because there are fewer incisions. Scar-free surgery. \"Surgeons are constantly seeking the least invasive and most effective method to help patients,\" says Dr. Michael Stamos, a UC Irvine Healthcare colon and rectal surgeon who is also a leader in LESS methods. He and Nguyen are two of only a few surgeons in the United States schooled in the challenging methods involved in this approach. Using LESS techniques, Stamos pioneered the no-visible-scar colectomy, which entails removal of all or part of the large intestine (colon). The procedure requires one tiny incision inside the belly button through which the operation takes place. Another 2- to 3-inch incision is made below the bikini line to remove the organ and is camouflaged by natural body contours. Later, there's virtually no visible trace that surgery was performed. \"When conventional surgical methods are used, this procedure requires a large abdominal incision,\" says Stamos. \"Even a traditional minimally invasive colectomy involves three or four small visible incisions.\" UC Irvine Medical Center is one of the only hospitals in the United States to offer no-visible-scar colectomies. \"LESS is an important step toward scar-free and pain-free surgery\u2014our ultimate goal,\" says Stamos. What accounts for this major step forward? \"LESS was made possible by the development of new surgical scopes that are extremely flexible and adaptable,\" says Stamos. Called \"articulatable\" scopes, they're outfitted with a flexible-tip camera. When the device is inserted into an incision in the belly button, it enables surgeons to see high-quality images and fine details in the surgical field. The instrument's flexibility also allows doctors to view the area from multiple angles in three-dimensional perspective. \"We're able to change the direction of our view easily, as well as look around corners and behind structures,\" says Stamos. \"Once the scope and other necessary instruments are introduced through the belly button, surgery proceeds inside the patient the same as if a large incision were made.\" \"LESS is considered remarkable for many reasons, including the fact it's a bridge to surgery that will involve no incisions whatsoever,\" says Nguyen. This huge transformation, which is taking place right now, involves a method called NOTES, or natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. \"With NOTES, a flexible endoscope is placed through one of the body's natural openings such as the mouth, anus, vagina, or urethra to access the area that needs surgery,\" says Nguyen. This revolutionary approach has many benefits, including complete elimination of wound infection and internal scar tissue, as well as external scarring. Furthermore, because no external incision is involved, NOTES potentially can be used in settings where sterile operating rooms are not available, such as battlefields and third-world country environments. A long-awaited development. \"Progress has been hampered by the slow development of surgical instruments for NOTES procedures, but headway is steadily being made in this area,\" says Stamos. He and Nguyen predict that NOTES procedures will be widely available within 10 years. \"This is a long-awaited development and it will change the way surgery is done forever,\" says Stamos. For a referral to a minimally invasive digestive disease surgeon, call 888.717.GIMD.There's a surgical revolution taking place\u2014and it promises to benefit millions of people worldwide. LESS is an important step toward scar-free and pain-free surgery\u2014 the ultimate goal of surgeons.8 OnE P ATIEnT' S STORY Mary Munday, a generous supporter of UC Irvine's Department of Ophthalmology, remembers the turmoil she experienced decades ago when her mother's eyesight began vanishing.

Indeed, Munday's brother and sister later developed the condition. To protect her sight, in the 1970s Munday began making the long commute from her Orange County home to UCLA's renowned Jules Stein Eye Institute for semiannual eye exams. About 15 years ago, though, a local ophthalmologist whom she trusted suggested she give UC Irvine a chance. After some hesitation, she eventually did. At UC Irvine, Munday says she has received topflight care from \"compassionate, highly skilled eye doctors.\" When Munday began seeing flashes of light, for instance, ophthalmologists diagnosed her with dry eye and successfully treated the condition. Last year, Dr. Jeremiah Tao successfully removed precancerous basal cells from Munday's lower left eyelid. The doctor later performed reconstructive surgery by grafting skin taken from an upper eyelid onto the lower lid. Department Chair Dr. Roger Steinert later excised a precancerous, spider-web like growth from Munday's right eye. Munday holds UC Irvine's ophthalmologists in such high esteem that she has become a major supporter of the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute. When completed, the institute will be a national center of excellence for eye care and eye research and the only university eye clinic between San Diego and Los Angeles. \"I want to have a Jules Stein-type of institute down here, with the latest technology,\" Munday says. \"We deserve one.\" Dr. Jeremiah Tao Dr. Roger Steinert Help Us Help Y ou9 Thanking Our Donors $20 million and above M.
