Chiropractic is a system of therapy focused on the structure of the body, especially the spine. Trained chiropractors manipulate the body's alignment to relieve pain, improve function, and to aid the body in healing naturally. How do our patients benefit from chiropractic care? At NeuSpine Institute, we work with a tight knit group of physicians that we rely on when we refer our patients. This means that the same level of care and attention to detail that our patients depend on in our practice is extended by our chiropractic practitioners. What can you expect at your visit to the chiropractor? The mainstay of chiropractic practice is spinal manipulation but can also include manual or manipulative therapies, postural and exercise education, and ergonomic training. The benefit of a chiropractic care visit is that the practitioner will train the patient on how to walk, sit and stand to limit back strain in everyday activities. The most promising, positive research on chiropractic therapy has been focused on spinal manipulation for the alleviation of back pain. It has been found to be an effective alternative to pain-relieving drugs, in fact the American College of Physicians low back pain guideline recommends spinal manipulation along with heat, acupuncture, and massage as the leading treatment for back pain. In conjunction with chiropractic care, a spinal brace may be prescribed for a patient suffering from back pain to provide lumbar support. NeuSpine Institute offers this non-invasive treatment as a way to relieve and prevent back and neck pain. The spinal brace, also known as a back brace is effective for limiting motion, stabilizing weak or injured spinal structures, and preventing the progression of spinal deformity. A spinal brace is necessary for many reasons during chiropractic treatment. It provides the needed relief, expedites healing, and prevents future problems from arising that would complicate the patient's existing condition. The combination of immobilization of the injured area and stabilization of the areas of weakness after surgery provides a better chance of recovery for the patient. Furthermore, the brace helps lessen strain and pressure on the spine and improves posture while elongating the spine. When it comes to alleviating back pain, you need the best team on your side which includes the medical professionals at NeuSpine Institute and our chiropractic network of physicians.
