Publisher Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd PY - 2023/2 Y1 - 2023/2 N2 - Vaccines are vital for protection against existing and emergent diseases. Current vaccine production strategies are limited by long production times, risky viral material, weak immunogenicity, and poor stability, ultimately restricting the safe or rapid production of vaccines for widespread utilization. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems, which use extracted transcriptional and translational machinery from cells, are promising tools for vaccine production because they can rapidly produce proteins without the constraints of living cells, have a highly optimizable open system, and can be used for on-demand biomanufacturing. Here, we review how CFPS systems have been explored for the production of subunit, conjugate, virus-like particle (VLP), and membrane-augmented vaccines and as a tool in vaccine design. We also discuss efforts to address potential limitations with CFPS such as the presence of endotoxins, poor protein folding, reaction stability, and glycosylation to enable promising future vaccine design and production.
