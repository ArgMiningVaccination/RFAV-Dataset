Instead the contacts of diphtheria patients should receive a dose (0. 5ml) of adsorbed diphtheria vaccine (diphtheria vaccine adsorbed ptap) or adsorbed diphtheria-tetanus vaccine, (dt vaccine adsorbed ptap, which protects against both diphtheria and tetanus) and followed after 1 to 2 months with a second dose. Prophylaxis with diphtheria vaccine gives protection for many years and is practically free from reaction. use in treatment : a dose of 10000 to 30000 iu of diphtheria antitoxin may be injected intramuscularly in mild to moderately severe cases of diphtheria and up to a max. Of 100000 iu in severe cases after testing for serum sensitivity (see below for reactions to horse serum). In addition antibiotics and corticosteroids may be administered. It is advised that after recovery from diphtheria, the patients should be actively immunized for long term protection by use of two doses at an interval of 1 to 2 months with adsorbed diphtheria vaccine or with adsorbed diphtheria-tetanus vaccine. reaction to horse serum : injection of diphtheria antitoxin in horse-serum-sensitive individual can produce immediate reaction of acute anaphylaxis which could sometimes be fatal unless immediately countered by injecting 1ml of 1:1000 adrenaline intramuscularly. Every care should be taken to prevent this reaction. Before injection of diphtheria antitoxin it is necessary to enquire from the patient 1) whether he/she has had injections of any serum before 2) whether there is personal or family history of allergy i. E. Asthma, eczema or drug allergy. The sensitivity of the patient to serum is tested by injecting subcutaneously 0. 1ml of diphtheria antitoxin diluted 1:10 and the patient is observed for 30 min. For local and general reactions. If the test dose shows either local reaction such as wheal and flare or general anaphylactic reaction such as palor, sweating, nausea, vomiting urticaria or fall of blood pressure, these should be treated with 1ml of 1:1000 adrenaline (which should always be kept handy) before injecting the main dose of diphtheria antitoxin. Half the dose of adrenaline may be repeated 15 min. Later if necessary. in allergic individuals, the diphtheria antitoxin is to be injected 15 to 30 mins. After administration of antihistamines adrenaline (1:1000) may be injected intramuscularly at the same time as the antiserums. Administration of hydrocortisone or adrenaline may be repeated if necessary. in some cases symptoms such as itching urticarial rash, pains in joints and muscles, fever, enlargement of lymph glands appear 7-12 days after the injection of diphtheria antitoxin. These should be treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Usually these symptoms of serum sickness last a few days and the patients recover without any complications.

Company Details About the Company Dr. Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine, was born on 15th March, 1860 in Odessa, Russia. An illustrious disciple of Dr.Aleck Metchnikoff and Dr.Louis Pasteur, Dr Haffkine arrived in Calcutta in 1892 with a mission to tackle the problem of a Cholera epidemic. He arranged for clinical trials of his vaccine and successfully helped to combat the dreadful disease from spreading further. When plague broke out in 1896, he was invited to set up a Plague Research Laboratory in Mumbai . It was later renamed as Haffkine Institute in 1925.With a view to expand the production activities and to meet the growing demands for medicines & life saving drugs, the Haffkine Institute was bifurcated by Government of Maharashtra in 1975 and the production activities were entrusted to HAFFKINE BIO-PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION LTD. , a fully owned Govt. of Maharashtra Company, registered under the Companies Act,1956. Haffkine Ajintha Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a subsidiary of Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd. , was established in 1977. The Corporation plays a pioneering role in the development and production of a wide range of Bacterial and Viral vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, plague, poliomyelitis and rabies.. The Corporation also formulates pharmaceutical products, disinfectants , ointments, injectables, syrups and mixtures. The Antitoxin and Sera department of HBPCL is located at Pimpri near Pune, and it is engaged in the manufacture of Antiserum against Tetanus, Diphtheria, Gas gangrene, Snake and Scorpion Venoms. The ATS department was established in 1940 at Mumbai for production of Anti Snake Venom Serum (ASVS) and subsequently shifted to Pimpri from 1952-53 onwards in a phased manner. The ATS dept operates on 75 acres of land and it is headed by Manager and assisted by different technical and nontechnical staff. The total staff strength at present is about 133. About 400 equines are also maintained to produce various antisera. The antisera are produced by HBPCL at most economical and affordable prices and are supplied mainly to various states and Central Government Institutions including defence. All the antisera are produced by hyperimmunising the equines by injecting gradually increasing doses of antigens (Venom/Toxin) over a period of 6 to 8 months. Once the equines attain a certain level of potency against the antigen, blood is collected in an anticoagulant solution from the equines every month and the blood is allowed to stand overnight. Next day the plasma is separated and the Red Blood Cells are reinfused into the body of equines (Plasmapheresis). The separated plasma that contains specific immunoglobulins is further processed by enzyme digestion and chemical separation to obtain purified equine immunoglobulins. The serum is tested for safety and potency on mice and then contenarised for distribution. Seller Contact Details Acharya Donde Marg, Mumbai - 400012, Maharashtra, India Have a requirement?
