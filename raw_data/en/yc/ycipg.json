A parasite that enters the human body in contaminated drinking water, grows for almost a year and emerges through a burning blister in the skin. Symptoms: Symptoms begin just before the worm starts to emerge from the blister. Victims suffer intense pain, often accompanied by bacterial infection and inability to walk. Can It Be Eradicated? Yes. With no medical cure or vaccine, eradication will be achieved by interrupting the life cycle of the parasite through education, community empowerment, and low-tech interventions like water filtration. Status: On track for ERADICATION On the Cusp of Eradication In 1986, Guinea worm disease was common in 21 countries across Africa and Asia. Today, it exists in isolated areas of just four African nations. Only one human disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. But soon a second infection will join the list: Guinea worm disease, a painful and debilitating condition caused by the Guinea worm\u2014known to many as the \"fiery serpent.\" There is no medicine to cure Guinea worm disease and no vaccine to prevent it. Yet it can be stopped. Guinea worm is not new. Many scholars believe the biblical \"fiery serpents\" that attacked the children of Israel in the Old Testament were actually Guinea worms. A calcified Guinea worm was even discovered in a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy. This engraving from the 1600s shows physicians in Persia (now Iran) removing Guinea worms from their patients' legs.

United States National Library of Medicine A Case Study In South Sudan As recently as 1986, Guinea worm disease afflicted some 3.5 million people every year across Africa and Asia. Since then, the number of cases has been reduced by more than 99.99%. The Carter Center has led the herculean effort, together with its many partners, educating and empowering communities in Asia and Africa to bring the fiery serpent to the edge of extinction. The Curse of the Fiery Serpent Children Suspected of Guinea Worm. South Sudan, 2013 Swellings beneath the bandages on these boys' feet may hide Guinea worms preparing to emerge. By staying at a case containment center, the boys avoid contaminating public waters. And if worms do emerge, they can be safely removed and the wounds treated.

Some historians believe the medical symbol known as the Staff of Asclepius\u2014a snake coiled around a stick\u2014was inspired by the age-old method of Guinea worm extraction.

The Carter Center/Louise Gubb Tracking and Containment When the goal is eradication, it's not enough to stop some or even most cases of the disease. Health workers must work tirelessly to track down every single case of Guinea worm disease. When a suspected case is reported, teams set out to find the afflicted person, confirm the diagnosis, identify the infected water source, and break the chain of transmission as quickly as possible. Only when every case is contained can eradication be achieved. Suspected Guinea worm patients are encouraged to come to \"case containment centers,\" which keep the patients from entering local water sources and spreading the disease. At these centers, worms are also safely extracted and patients have access to bathing facilities, fresh bedding, latrines and healthy food for themselves and their families.
