It is a constitutionally autonomous public university within Michigan's syslem of public colleges and universities. As a national research university, Wayne Stale is committed to high standards in research and scholarship. In the ans, it fosters a'llativity and strives for excellence in perfonnance and exhibition. Its first priority is to davelop new knowledge and encourage its application. Because It is a national research university, Wayne State develops and maintains slrong graduate and professional programs in many fields. To maintain its standards, Wayne State seeks to strengthen those programs that have achieved national recognition while, at the same time, fostering those programs which show promise for the Mure. Wayne Stale strives to maintain its performance ranking as measured by its funded research, the quality of its graduate programs as evaluated by national studies of graduate education, and the effectiveness of all academic programs as assessed by external evaluation. As an urban teaching university, and because its graduates typically remain to live and work in the area throughout their lives, Wayne State seeks especially to serve residents of the greater Delrolt metropolitan area, although it enrolls students from across the state and nation as well as foreign lands. It makes available high quality educational programs in more than six hundred fields of study or concentration leading to more than three hundred different degrees at the bachelo(s, master's and doctoral levels. As a nationally ranked university, Wayne Stale holds high expectations for the educational achievements of its students and consequently maintains selective admissions standards; but as an urban university it recognizes an obltgation to develop special avenues that encourage access for promising students from clsadvantaged educational backgrounds. The University aspires to implement its curricula in ways that serve the needs of a nontraditional student population that is racially and ethnically diverse, commuting, wori<ing, and raising families. Its student body is composed of students of lraditional college age together with many older students, and indudes many who are from the first generation in their family or neighbomood to attend a university. In its teaching, the University strives to be sensitive to the special experiences, conditions, and opportunities presented by this diversity in its student body. To meet its obligations to its nontraditional students, the University attempts to schedule dasses throughout the metropolitan area and during the evening as well as during the day. Wayne State University recognizes its obligation to serve. Like other major universities, it strives to serve the disciplines and professions represented among its academic programs as well as public and private sector organizations and associations at local, state, and national '8vels. As an urban university, it makes a special commitment to the Detroit metropolitan area in three ways: first, it uses its metropolitan locale as a setting for basic and applied research and fos1ers the development of new knowledge of urban physical and social environments; second, it employs its locale as a teaching laboratory and incorporates metropolitan area materials into its curriculum; and third, it brings knowledge to bear to assist and strengthen the metropolitan area. In particular, Wayne State University contributes to the economic revitalization of southeastern Michigan through research programs that develop new technology and teaching programs that educate the citizens who will live and work in the region in the coming years. Wayne State University respects and protects lhe personal and academic freedom of its students, faculty and academic stall. The programs and activities of lhe University an, open to all qualified persons without regard ID race, religion, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, age, national or elhnic origin, poitical belief, or physical hancicap, exoept as may be required by law. The University seeks to demonsllale.- lhrough an ill programs and aclillities, its appraciation of human diversity and ID maintain an almoephere of tolerance and mutual respect lhat will nourish human liberty and delnocratic citizenship. A relatively youlhful state university-j)811 of Mchigan's stale suppo1111d system of higher education only sinoe 1956-Wayne State University has dew,loped rapidly as a national research university with urban leaching and service missions. Nevertheless, tt recognizes lhat much must be achiewd before lhe goals tt holds for ilself are fully attainad. It is pu,suing lhose goals wtth pride in its progress and confidenoe in ils future.

No student is eligible for residence classification unless (s)he or, it (s)he is a minor, lhe person from whom (s)he derives residence (pursuant to paragraph six below), mee1s lhe qualifications prescribed herein for residence and has lived in lhis state continuously for at least six months immediately prior to the first day of classes of lhe tarm for which resident classificiation is being sough~ save for temporary absences as defined in paragraph two below. \u00b7 2. For lhe purposes of lhesa regulations, lhe terms residence' and 'domicile' are synonymous. In general, domicile is lhe place where a person actually resides with lhe intention of making itlhe person's true, fixed, permanent home and principal establishment and to which, whenever (s)he is temporarily absen~ (s)he has lhe intention of returning. Full-time attendance at school outside Michigan and initial enlisbnent in a military.service are examples of temporary absences. Other absences for more than six months wiH be presumed to be nontemporary. The fact of physical presence at lhe dwelling;,lace and the intention to make it a home must concur and the intention must be to make a home in fact in a certain place, and not an intention to acquire a domicile in order to obtain lhe benefit of lhe legal consequences of having a domicile !here. A person may have but one domicile ata time, and a domicile, once established, continues until itis superseded by a new domicile. 3. Normally, lhe sojourn in this state of a student from another state tor lhe primary purpose. of anendng school is not residence and It is presumed that a non-resident at lhe time of his or her enrollment continues in that classification throughout his or her presence as a student, except where it can be established lhat his or her previous domicile has been abandoned and a new one established. If a student enrolls in undergraduate school for more lhan eight credits, or in graduate school for more lhan six credi1s, or in Law School for more lhen ten credits in any one lull lenglh lerm, within six manlhs after arrival in Michigan, It is normally presumed lhat lhe student's sojourn is for the purpose of attending school and not to establish domicile. 4. The following facts, allhough not conclusive, have probative value in support of a claim for residence classification: acceptance of an offer of permanent employment in lhis state; former residence in lhe state and lhe maintenance of significant connections !herein while absent; economic or social compulsion causing a person to abandon a former residence and acquire residence in the stale wilh allendance at lhe Uniwrsity only an incident to such residence. 5. The following facts, standng allone, are not accepted as sufficient evidence of domicile: employment by the Uniwrsity as a fellow, scholar, assistant, or in any position normally filed by studen1s; a statement of intention to acquire a domicile in lhis stale; voling or registration for voting ; lhe lease of living quarlers; payment of local and slate taxes; automolbile registration; driver's license; or continued presance in Michigan during vacation periods. 6. For purposes of lhesa regulations, the -of majority is 18 years. A minor does not have lhe capacity to establish his or her own domicile. Normally, lhe domicile of a minor follows: (a) That of lhe paren1s or surviving parent; (b) That of lhe parent to whom custody of lhe minor has been awarded by a divorce or olher judicial decree; or (c) That of lhe parent wilh whom lhe minor in fact makes his or her home, tt !here has been a separatioo without a judcial award of custody;or (d) That of an adoptive parent, where !here has been a legal adoption, even !hough lhe natural paren1s or parent may be living; or (e) That of a 'natural' guardian, such as grandparent with whom lhe minor in fact makes his or her home, where the minor has permanently left his or her parental home and reasonable expectation of substantial financial support from the paren1s has been dissolved. (ij If a Michigan resident parent orguardan of a minor moves his or her residence to another slate, the minor shall remain eligible for resident tuition status as long as (s)he continues to anend school regularly in this state. 7. Where a general guardian has been appointed by lhe state of the ward's domicile, at the time of appointment the ward's domicile presumption remains in lhat stale. The appointment by a Michigan court of a resident guarcian of a minor not domiciled in this state at the time of appointment has no effect upon lhe domicile of lhe ward. 8. A minor who has permanendy left his or her parental home, and who has no reasonable expectation of substantial financial support from his or her paren1s or legal guardan, etc., may qualify for residency slalUs as if (s)he were of majority age. 9. An alian student may apply for resident status under one or more of lhe following regulations in lhe same manner as a citizen, ii he/she is in lhe United States for olher lhan a temporary purpose. In order to demonstrate that he/she is here for olher lhan a temporary purpose, lhe alien student must be eilher a permanent resident alien wilh an 1-151 or 1-551 Alien Receipt Card or an applicant for adjustment to permanent resident alien status whose application has been approved by lhe Immigration and Naturalization Service; OR an alien with a 0-4 vise; OR an alien wilh an 1-94 Arrival-Departure Record Card, endorsed either 'refugee' or 'applicant for adjustment'; OR an alien with documentation from lhe Immigration and Naturalization Service lhat he/she has been granted asylum in lhe United States; OR an alien with other documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service Iha! reflects status equivalent to one of lhe above denominated categories.

Special AdluatmMta: The Registrar is authorized to make adjustrnenlS in the application of the policies staled in this section when unusual ciroomstances warrant. Circumstances which may warrant special consideration include non-at111ndance by the sbJdent or the death or serious illness of the sbJdent or of someone closely related. SbJdenlS (or an authorized representative in the case of death or serious illness) must submtt their applications and supporting documentation to Registration and Scheduling. STUDENT RECORDS University Grading System A repor1 of grades and mar1<s is sent to each registered srudent after the close of each semester. Final grades are recorded under the following syslem: Grawate Grades The graduate grading syslem is intended to reflect higher standards of aitical and aeetive scholarship then those applied at the undergraduate level. To receive a graduata grade in courses open to both undergraduate and graduata sbJdenlS, the graduate sbJdent is expected to do wo111 of superior quality and is required to do any additional work specified by the instructor. Graduate sllldenlS are required to earn a 'B' (3.0) average to satisfy degree requirernenlS. Grades ol 'C' and p are dellnltely unaadalactory and conatllule valid cauu for dropping a otudent from graduate otudy. To be awarded a graduate degree, the srudent must have achieved at least a 'B' average. A limtted number of 'C' grades, though unsatislaclOfy, may be applied toward a graduate degree provided they are offset by an equal number of 'A' grades. SbJdenlS are advised to consult their depertmenlS for specific limitations on 'C' grades. Every effort is made to assist sllldenlS whose wol1I suffers 84 a result of conditions beyond their control, or interruption of srudy for milttary service. Law School and School of Medicine: This grading systam does not apply to Law School studenlS or studenlS in the four-year M.D. program of the School of Medicine. SbJdenlS enrolled in those programs should see the appropriate sections of this BuNetin and should consult with appropriate Program Directors for more information. Final grades are recorded under the following system. . . . aedlt hour M Marginal Pass in designated courses such as field wo111, practicums. and intamships (NOT considered in calculation of honor point average). Sand U Satisfactory and Unsattsfacto,yperlormance in non-degree courses and in certain designated courses such as fiek/ wo111, practicums and intemships. The grade of s\u00b7 is given for aH dissertation aedllS upon final acceptance of the dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. and Ed.D. degrees. 'S' and \u00b7u\u00b7 grades are not considered in the calculation of the honor point average. Graduate Marks The mark ol 'l'-lncomplate, is given to an undergraduata or a graduate srudent who has not completed aH the course wo111 as planned for the course and when there is, in the judgment of the instructor, a reasonable probability that the srudent can cornplele the course successfully without attsnding regular class sessions. The responsibility for completing aft course wo111 reslS entirely wtth the student. A final grade is recorded when the student cornpletas the appropriate course work as arranged with the instructor or, in the Gtrural Information 23 absence of the instructor, the department chairperson. {The mark of 'I' shall not be changed to a grade of 'F' unless, after receiving the 'I,' the student's subsequent work is of such quality that the overall average for the course is below passing.) The course work must be completed by the sbJdent within one calendar year. The mark of 'I' which is not converted. to a letter grade within one calendar-year from the time it was received wiU be considered a withdrawal ('W), unless, prior to the end of that year, the srudent requests, and the instructor agrees to ceflify to \u00b7student Records, that another calendar year has been granted for the removal of the lncomple18. The mark of 'I' is inappropriate if, in lhe inslructor's judgment, it will be necessa,y for the student regularly to attend subsequent sessions of lhe class. Should regular attendance become necessa,y, the slUdent must register for Iha class for the semester in which attendance is planned. In \"\"' be 'W,' and lhe student will be assessed IUition and applicabls fees for the second registration. The mark of 'W'-Olflclat Withdrawal, is given when the student has dropped the course in accordance with University policy. See 'Drop/Add' below, page 27. The Mark of 'X'-No grade repol'led, is a no-nitive mark used when there has been insufficient work submitted and there is no basis on which to assign a grade. The mark of 'Y'-Deferred, is given when the srudent is up-to-<1818 in the work of a course planned to continue beyond the semester {i.e., essay, thesis, dissertation and certain courses taken in sequence). The mark of 'Z'-Audltor, is given when the sbJdent has formally registered for the cou'rse for audit. The student's Academic Dean or his/her designee must provide written audit authorization to the student at the time of registration. Change of Grade and Mark Once recorded in the Office of the Registrar, grades/marks will be changed only if an official Change of Grade form, property compleled and signed by the instructor, is submitted to the school or college Grades Coordinator, and is received by Student Records within three semeslers (one calendar year) alter the end of the 18rm for which the relevant course was originally graded/marked. Credits A credit (credit hour) is defined as one class hour per week or ils approved equivaktnt requiring a minimum of two hours of preparation per week carried through a semester. A credit in other modes of instruction should be made as consistent as possible with the above definition. Laboratory: A three-llour laboratory period is normally regarded as the equivalent of One class hour. Honor Point Average The honor point average is the numerical index of the student's scholastic average. Poin1S are assigned to each letter grade (see University Grading System, above) for each hour of aedit. For example, a grade ol 'A' in a class canying 3 credits would be assigned 12honorpoints (3 x 4), and a grade of 'C' in a class carrying 4 credi1S would be assigned 8 honor poin1S (4 x 2). To compu18 the honor point average, multiply the honor points assigned to each grade {lisled above) by the number of credit hours for each course; then add the results and divide by the total number of 24 General Information. credils. In the example cited, the honor point average would be: 20 (honor points) divided by 7 {credits attempted) = 2.85, nominally a B-fflinus average. The base excludes credit by special examination, transfer credit, courses with a mark of 'W or 'X,' and courses in which a grade of '$,' 'U,' or 'M' have been received. See page 25 (Repeating Courses) for the policy on honor points for repealed courses at the gradua18 level. Law School: This honor point syslem does not apply to Law School studen1S. Responsible Attendance and Performance Srudents must show diligence and are normally expected to complete the cour'se!i they elect. Irresponsible attendance is wasleful of both student and University resources. Those sbJdents who consistently receive excessive marks of 'I' {incomplete) and 'W' {Withdrawal) may be refused the privilege of further registration by the dean or the dean's designee of their school or college. Students experiencing attendance difficulties should seek counseling from appropriate college or University offices. Release of Student Records The University reoognizes admission and academic records of students as being privileged and has a policy designed to ensure that this information is not imprope~y divulged without the consent of the student. The University is subject to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act and has promulgated regulations pursuant thereto. Copies of the regulations and a list of student records mainlained by the University are available for inspection in the Office of the Registrar. The University reserves the right to provide anonymous academic information to other schools and colleges when it is to be used for curriculum evaluation purposes. Michigan's Freedom of Information Act The Freedom of Information Act (PA 242) provides that a member of the public, in accordance with certain guidelines, has a right to inspect and receive copies of public records maintained by the University. A public record is broadly defined and includes written documents, pictures, recordings, punch cards, magnetic cards, etc., which are maintained by the University in the course of official responsibilities. However, certain records are exempt from disdosure. The Media Relations Office, 3222 Faculty/Administration Building, is designated as the office responsible for accepting requests for public records, and the Director of that office is the University officer in charge of providing this service. Undel\" the statute, a fee can be charged for records released and is based on the cost of labor involved in the search, examination and duplication of records, as well as the mailing_ oosts.

Credit by Examination A graduale student who wishes 10 ob1ain aedit toward an advanced degree for knowledge in a field essential to hishler program of study, acquired by means which predude fonnal transfer 10 Wayne Stale University, may petition for an advanced credit examination in a course or coursas covering the relevant area of study. The petition requesting such advanced credit shall state the basis for lhe \"\"\"est in lenns of the student's competenca at the graduate level. in the particular academic area. The established examination fee must be paid before the examination is taken. All grades will be recorded on the student's nnscript. Such grades will not be used In computing the honor point average. The fulfillment of any requirement through credtt by examination does not relieva the student of lhe r-ce requirement for the edvanced degree. Graduate Courses Generally, courses numbered 500 and above are cons\u00ad graduate lavel; in some departments, certain 500--and 600-level courses are not pennitted for graduale aedit and are so designated. Coursas numberad 700 and above are open only 10 graduale students. Graduate work is classified either as course work, in which students meet as an assembled group, or as research. Directed Study: Independent study may be authorized provided the area of interest is an inlegral part of lhe student's graduale program and is\u00b7 not covered by courses scheduled while completing one's course requirements. Before a Ph.D. student may register in directed study, he/she must complate lhe Ph.D. direcled study petition fonn and obtain the written permission of the Graduale School. The petition must contain information about the nature, scope, and significance of lhe course, and indicate the major \"\"\"irements the student must lulfiU. Master's students must obtain the written pennission of their collage Graduate Officer. Business Administration: All courses numberad ~9 and 700 or higher are open only to students formally admitted 10 a Wayne State graduate program, or 10 qualified guest students. Enrollment in these courses must be approved by a graduate adviser or be consislent with a student's Plan of Worlc. Students in an undergraduate, post-bachelor, or non-matriculaled status are not eligible. Law School: In addition to the above approvals, graduate students must obtain the written permission of the Law School Dean 10 elect law School courses or directed studies. G1Mral btformation 'IT Graduate Credits For definition of Credi (Credit Hour), see page 24. MaJor credlta: credils earned in the student's major field are designated as major credll&. The dissertation, thesis, or essay and at least on&--half of all other credilB, inclucing the final seminar (ff required), must be in the major field, Minor crecllta: credits earned in departmenl& other than 1ha major are classffied as minor or cognate credilB. Election of minor credit is encouraged to enable the applicant to broaden his/her program. Minor courses should be related to the major and eight or more graduate credits approved by the unit graduate committee chairperson will constitute a minor. Transfer of Credits-Graduate In work toward the master's degree, credit beyond the twenty-four credilB which must be earned in residence may be transferred from accredited graduale schools, provided such credit is 'B' or betler and cemfied as graduate-level credit on an official transcript A s1Udent wishing to transfer gradual& credit toward the Ph.D. deg188 must file a petition with the Gradual& School, approwd by his/her adviser and Departmental Graduate Committee Chairperson, requesting such transfer. The petition must be supported by an official transcript showing a minimum grade of 'B' for the cou111es to be translerTBd; 'B-minus\u00b7 credit is not acceptable for transfer. Transfer credits must be appropriate to the student's degree program. Doc1oral cissertation credil& wHI not be translerTBd. Cou111es accepted for transfer credit from outside or within Wayne State University cannot have provided credit toward a prior degree except when the mastefs or another pr&-<loctoral cemficate or degree is applied to the doctoral degl88. Admission to Wayne State University based upon a pre\\/iously earned mastefs degl88 does not guarantee that \\hose cradil& are applicable to a graduate degl88 at Wayne State Unive1111ty. Extenllon Credlta earned at other than Michigan institutions cannot be applied toward a graduate degree nor an educalion specialist certificate. School of Business Administration: A maximum of six semester credits (two cou111es) may be transferred from other graduate institutions. Maximum Credit Load A student with a strong academic record who is devoling full-time to graduate study and carrying no oulBide employment may register in a program not to exceed sixteen credits per semesrer. A student engeged in part-time work should limit registration in proportion to the amount of oulside work. A student employed full-lime will normally not register in excess of eight credits. A student working lull-lime who desires to carry more than eight credits, must get pennission from his/her Graduate Offi<er or Dean. Some colleges or schools stipulate other maximum a-edit requirements, which rake precedence over those set by the Graduate School. Graduate Assistanls are required to register for six to twelve crecil& each semester. The University conside111 a program of eight graduate credits per semester to be full-lime study. Additional Essay, Thesis, or Dissertation Elections and Fee Policy A graduate student who has enrolled for all elections (inclucing essay, thesis, or cissertation) stipulated by his/her Plan of Worl<, and who has completed all the requiremenl& of these elections, but has not completed the essay, thesis, or dissertation, will be required to register for at least one cred~ (the appropriate amount to be determined by the department) of essay, thesis, or cissertation direction until such time as the student: a) completes the requirements for the degree; b) declares him/herself no longer a candidate for the degree; or 28 G,.,ral biformalion c) exceeds the time limit allotted for securing the degree. For these credilB, the student will pay customary fees and will register as an aucitor. No degree credtt wiH be granted for these elections which are beyond the required credils for an essay, thesis, or cissertation. A mark of \u00b7z\u00b7 (Auditor) will be recorded on lhe student's record for adcitional elections. College of Nurslng:The additional elections and lee policy also applies to field studies and research practicums. Short-Term and Travel-Study Courses for Graduate Credit Shorl-Twm, Workahop-lnatltute-Confwence, and Trav-tudy courses offered for graduate credit must be proposed, approved and authorized wail in advance via the appropriate form (obtainable from the Gradual& School). After an initial authorization, cou111es to be repealed with no oubatanlial change may be petitioned and approved by memorandum on the basis of the original on file. Shotl-Twm Cour-are those created or adapted to meet for a time period of less than on&--half an academic aemester--i.e., less than 7-1/2 weeks. Such coulll8S offered for graduate crecit will provide for at least fifleen contact hou111 and the requisite proportion of oulside preparation for each hour of crecit. It is assumed that short-term coullles will not differ from regular fifteen-week colillles in terms of objectives, content, contact hou111, or academic expectations, unless such a cifference is reflected by a proportioning of graduate credils. Workahop-lnatltut..COnferance Couraea (WICS) are those specially fonnulated experiences which, because of their usually 'applied' nature, lend themselves toan exceptionally brief but intensive time span. They differ from short-term courses in their cxmcentration, usuaHy spanning from a single day to two or three weekends. Ollered for graduate credit, these cou111es provide for a minimum of twenty-five contact hou111 and an appropriate proportion of additional work for each hour of credit. Since these experiences vary greatly in their purposes and the degree of participation expected of the student, they are offered lor credit only infrequently and enroll only \\hose studenls for whose academic programs they would be directly relevant. Graduate grading will be on an 'S' and \u00b7u\u00b7 .basis only. Travel-Study Couraea are those creeled or adapted to take special advantage of the opportunity to relate a particular COUlll8 of study to the cultures, mores, or institutions being studied. Such courses may involve either dorneslic or foreign travel. All are offered lhrough the College of Lifelong Leaming. Graduate credit for travel-<;tudy cou111es will be graded on an 'S' and 'U' basis only. Graduate students may not register for any course or CX>mbination of courses in these categories that permit the accumulation of graduate credilB at a rate greater than one crecit hour per week. Registrations that exceed this rate will be canceled in advance ff ciscovered and, in no case.will the excess a-edit be counted toward the requirements for a Wayne graduate degree. Graduate studenlB may apply toward a Wayne degree no more than four credil& earned in any combination of WIC and Travel-Study courses. This limitation applies to the total of a graduate student's work at Wayne, so that if four credils are applied toward the Mastefs degree, none may be applied toward a subsequent specialis~ second Master's, or a doctoral degree. Credils approved for COUllles in these categories are the maximum allowable so that registrations will not be permitted for contingent directed studies or other similar course or research elections. Obligations of Faculty and Students to the Instructional Process Since educalion is a cooperalive effort between teacher and student, bolh parties must fulfill obligations if the integrity and efficacy of the instructional process are to be preserved. Responsibilities of Faculty Members 1. To contribute to and remain abreast of the latest developmenls in !heir fields; 2. To continually pursue leaching excellence; 3.

It is expected lhat faculty and studen1s wWI fulfill their obligations to the instructional process. If, however, a complaint does arise, the parties should meet in an effort to resolve lhe matter. When such a discussion fails to resolve the problem or is inappropriate given the cirrumstances, lhe head of the academic unit should be con1acl8d. If this contact fails to satisfy the complain~ lhe college's published procedures should be followed. Although the University Ombudsperson is not a direct part of lhe appeal process, studenls and faculty may consutt the Ombudsperson at any point clJring such proceedings. Classroom Attendance Policy Whenever attendance forms a basis for a portion or all of a course grade, studenls must be provided with explicit written informadon concerning lhat fact during lhe first week of classes. SUch information shall be specific wtth regard to lhe penalty incurred for each abaence and the means, ff any, to compensale for the absence. It should be recognized that !here may be certain situations where lhe student may not be permitted to make up lhe absence(s). This policy sha! be applicable to all courses within lhe University, regarcless of setting. Deception, Fraud and Misuse of Documents Intentionally furnishing false information to the University is expNcldy prohibited, as is forgery, alteration, unauthorized possession, or misuse of University documenls, records and identilicalionairds. The University reserves lhe right to rescind degrees if the award of the degree was based in whole or in part on deception, fraud, other unacceptable academic conduct, or misuse of University documents. Student Rights and Responsibilities Upon the recommendation of lhe Studen1-'f'aculty Council, the University (Faculty) Counci, the Presidenl-Deans Conference and the President, lhe Board of Governors, in Januaoy, 1967, approved a comprehensive statement of Student Righls and Responsibiilies for the University. In addition, lhe Board of Governors adopted a Student Due Process Policy. This latter document provides uniform procedures for all schools and colleges. Copies of these documenls are available to studenls and faculty in lhe offices of lhe deans of each coUege and the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Law School: The faculty of the law School has approved a set of academic regulations, copies of which are available to all students enrolled in the Law School. College/School Grade Appeal Procedures Each college and school has established grade appeal prooedures. The appeal procedures are available from lhe Office of the College or Schoof Dean. In most instances, grade appeals must be filed within lhirty days of the time lhe student has or should have received his/her final grade. Academic Appeals Procedure In matters where a College's final decision is based upon the evaluation of a student's academic performance, and when review procedures available to himRler within the College have been exhausted, lhe student may request lhe Vice Presiden1 for Academic Affairs to review lhat decision on the record. A written Request for Review must be made bY the student himseltlherself, wilh a copy to the Daen of the College, postmarked within thirty calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision, which is to be sent to the address provided bY the student in the College's review procedures. Review by the Vice President for Academic Affairs of lhe College's GeMral lnformalion 29 decision win proceed as soon as practicable alter notification by Iha slUdent of his/her wish to seek review. The student may also file wilh Iha Vice President for Academic Affairs a Request for a . Postponement of Iha efleet of Iha College's final decision. Such a Request must be posbnarf<ed wilhin seven calendar days of Iha postmark of the College's final decision, and a copy must be sent to the Dean of Iha College. Upon receiving a Request for Postponemen~ Iha Voce President for Academic Affairs wiH immediately contact the Deen. Unless the College demonstrates clearly and convincingly that Iha injury to Iha College or to third persons thatwould result from such a postponement would outweigh the injury to the student from denying Iha postponement, the efleet of the decision rendered by the College will be postponed until Iha date lhat Iha Vice President for Academic Affairs issues a decision regarding lhe underlying Request for Review by Iha Vice President for Acedernic Affairs. The Vice President for Acedernic Affairs will inform the student and the Deen of her/his decision regarding Iha Request for Postponement within three school days -rvc:eiving the request Excaplions to this procedure may be granted by Iha Vice President for Acedernic Affairs upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. Academic Scholarship A graduate degree is evidence of scholarly attainment; of ability to achieve ecedemic excellence; of aitical and aeative ability wilh capacity to apply end to interpret what has been learned through research, the essay, Iha thesis, or the cissertation and the several examinations; of elhics in use of the work of others and in interpersonal relationships. See Graduate Grades, page ~- Student Ethics 1. The submission of fraudulen1 academic records for graduate admission or transfer of crecit by a student shall be cause for the slUdent's dismissal from the Graduate School. 2. Academic work submitted by a graduate student for graduate credit is assumed to be of his/her own creation, and, tt found not to be, wil constitute cause for the student's dismissal from the School. Academic Nepotism Faculty memtiers are not to place themselves, or alk:iw themselves to be placed, in a situation amounting to 'academic nepotism,' i.e., teaching or otherwise directing the crecit study or research of a student who is also a close relative. Concomitantly, students are not to take courses from close relatives or engage In research for academic a-edit under the direction of close relatives. All such credit will be disallowed. 30 G,.,ral lnforma1ion DEGREE and CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS In addtion lo lhB following regu/a6ons, requirement& may be specified by the indvidual gradiate departments. MASTER'S DEGREE The minimum Graduate School requirement for lhe master's degree is thirty credits, at least twenty-lour of which must be taken at Iha Universny. In those master's degree programs where the college, school or department requires more than the Graduate School minimum, their -irements take precedenoe. The Graduate School recognizes three general masters degree plans, though not all plans are offered in each department (for exact information, see listings under individual departments in the appropriate sections of this bulletin): PLAN A requires a total of thirty credits, including a total of eighl credits for a tMsis. PUN B requires a total of thirty credits, including a minimum of two credits for an essay. PUN C requires a total of thirty credits. The essay Of' thesis is Ml required. Candidacy Admission as an applicant does not assure acceptance as a candidate for a degree. Candidacy is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for graduation. Generally, studenls enrolled in masters degree programs are expected to file a Plan of Work by the time eight to twelve graduate credits have been earned. The applicant shall be advanced to lhe rank of 'Candidate' upon approval of the Plan of Worl< by the College Graduate Office. In most colleges candidacy must be authorized by the time twelve graduate credits have been earned or subsequent registration will be denied. In preparing the Plan, the studant and adviser should evaluate with care the personal and professional objectives of the student as well as all degree and departmental requirements. Time Limitation Students have a six-year time limit to complete all requirements for the master's degree. The six-year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student has taken work which applies toward meeting the requirements of the degree. The incividual college or school reserves the right of revalidation of over-ege credits which are between si~ and ten years old and which represent courses completed at Wayne State University. Such authority rests with the Graduate Offioerof the college or school. Students are not permitted to revalidate crecils earned at other institutions. In revalidation cases the adviser and the student must set a terminal date for completion of all degree requirements, including such additional requirements as may be presaibed to revalidate the over-ege a-edits. Time extensions beyond these conditions are authorized only for conditions clearly beyond the student's control. A student registered in a non-degree graduate classification is cationed that only one semester of full-time graduate study, or pan-time registration not to exceed nine credits, is permitted in this classification. Not more than nine a-edits may be applied toward the credit requirements for the master's degree. Please see the appropriate sections of this bulletin fer specific master's program information. Essays Under Plan B. departmenls require the completion of an essay prior to the granting of a masle(s degree. The essay must show evidence of scholarly study and writing and be relalBd IO Iha studenfs major. Candidalas are direded IO consult the~ depanmenls as IO matllN'S of essay manuscript style. GRADUATE CERTIFICATE Programs leading IO a graduate certificate are available through several University unils and are open IO sllldenls who rM8I the general graduate admission requiremenls of the University; individual programs may have addtional admissions requiremenls. The specific number of credls required for completion varies by program, though a graduate certificate program must consist of at least twelve graduate credils. Certificates may be !ree-i,tancing or may be earned concurrently with a graduate degree. A certificate program must be completed within three years, a minimum honor point aY8111ge of 3.0 in certificate courses must be maintained, and only ninesemeslercredils of certificate coursa worl< may be applied IOward a graduate degree. SIUdenlS should consult Iha specific certificate program desaiplion in this Bulletin to detemlina admission requiremenls, crecilS required for completion, and the degree(&) required for receipt of the certificate. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE RequiremenlS for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy emphasize an over-ilfl understancing of and high competence in a field of knowiledge, familiarity with cognate cisciplines, facility in the use of research techniques, and responsibility for the advancement of knowledge. The rMeling of the requiremenlS for the doctorate is tested primarily by examinations and the presentation of the dissertation rather than by a summation of courses, grades aid credllS. Admission A sllldent may be admitted to the sta111s of Ph.D. applicant if he/she meelS aft Graduate School requiremenlS for admission, presenlS an honor point average of 3.0 (8=3) for the upper civision of the undergraduate course worl< and is accepted for study - the degree by his or her school or college and major deparlment. In many depar1menls, a personal interview with the Chairpelson of the Depanment or the Chairperson of the Depanmental Graduate Committee is considered essential. SIUdenls presenting less than a 3.0 undergraduate honor point average are required IO complete a meste(s degree program, or ils equivalent, prior IO consideration for admission IO a Ph.D. program. Ph.D. Procedural Calendar The following outline itemizes the deadlines and procedures for processing documenlS required for completion oflhe doctoral degree. 1. Plan of Worlc: lnitialBd by student with adviser and Iha Graduate Committee Chairperson's signatures before completion of forty graduate crecilS and before scheduling the qualifying examination. 2. Repo,t of Oral Qualifying ExaminaNon /Examiner assigned by Gracilat& School/: Exam must be taken within one month after having passed the wrllbin exam. 3. Dissertatjon Outline and ProspeclUS: lnitialBd by student with signalllres of adviser, dissertation committee, and Graduate Committee Chairperson, after passing written and oral qualifying exams. 4. Final Defense Fonn and Manuscript Approval: Initiated by student with signatures of adviser, and dissertation committee, and Graduate Committee Chairperson, two weeks before cissertation defense. SIUdenlS must attach to the final defense fonn a copy of the flyer or other notice advertising the dissertetion defense to the Univeniity community. The last day for the dissertation defense is detemlined each semester. Check with the departmenfs Graduate Committee Chairperson for Commencement deadines. 5. Change of Grado Memorandum for Dissertation credits: Filed by adviser immediately after the cissertation defense. Dfreclecl Study: Registration in cirected study must have advance approval of the student's adviser and advance authorization of the Graduale School. A Graduate School Petition and Authorization for Direded SIUdy must be signed by the student's adviser, instruclOr, and the Graduate School dean befora registraUon. The DireclBd SIUdy Petition must contain all relevant details, inclucing an explicit course oudine, a rationale for the course, and information about the major academic requirements the student must succassfully fulfill. Plan of Work Early in hislhar program the doclOral applicant, with the assistance of an adviser, plans a sequence of studies. This Plan of Work, approved by the adviser and the Departmental Graduate Committee Chairperson, should be filed with the Gradualll School before the student has completed forty gradual& aedilS (induding tranafer crecilS), and before scheduling the qualifying examination. Ph.D. Coursework To ensure adequate preparation, the Graduate Counci has adopted minimum courseworl< requiremenlS for the University's highest degree. Many programs will exceed these statutory minima. A minimum of 90 graduate crecilS beyond the baccalaureate degree are required for completion of the Ph.D. progra_m. Normally, a Ph.D. program wiH consist of: (1) twenty credllS of courseworl< in the major (not including directed study or ressarch credit); (2) at least one minor composed of eight or more credllS elected oulSide the major depanment, or an intercisciplnary minor consisting of a minimum of twelve graduate credts; (3) thirty-two additional crscilS of courseworl<, pre-<lissertetion credilS of cissertation cirectlon. The Ph.D. program should provide for effective concentration in a major field with supporting courses in ralalBd fields. The decision concerning whether Iha studenfs Plan or Worlc wiU include one minor or two is made by the department. The IOtal Ph.D. program must include thirty credls, exduding cissertetion cirection, in courses open only IO graduate students (i.e., 700 level or above). Dissertation Registration The dissertetion should be given consideration early in the program, but generally a student wMI not be permitted to register for dissertation cirectlon (999) credit until he/she has fulfilled all requiremenlS for advancement IO Ph.D. cancidacy. In some cases, with the approval of the studenfs adviser and the Graduat& School, a Ph.D. applicant may be a-to register for up IO (but not mora than) ten crscits of dissertation cirection before being admitted IO candidacy. The final year may properly center on the req,iirements of Iha dissertation. a, .. ra1 tnfo..-ion 31 Dissertation Outline and Prospectus Prtor to lnltladng research, the Ph.D. student Schooi's Disserta~on Reconl is approl.'l!d by the student's cissertation advisory committee and the Chairperson of the Departmantal Graduate Committee. The Graduate School allo raqulrea that the aludent prepare dlaaertatlon proapectua, and aubmtt the DlaHrtallon Outline. Following departmentel approval, the Dissenalion Oudine is forwarded to the Graduate School for the Dean's approval and cistributian. Candidacy A Ph.D. Applicant will be advanced to the rank of Ph.D. Candidate when he/she submils an approved Plan of Wak, successfully completes the Qualifying Examinations and submits and receives the Graduate Dean's approval on the Dissertation Oudine and ProspeclUS. Program Exceptions A student who wishes to request an exception to any of the Ph.D. program mirnmum requiremenls should file a written, detailed petition with his/her adviser. If the adviser approves the petition, he/she will forward it, along with his/her recommendation, to the Chairperson of the Departmental Graduate Committee. If approved by the department, the petition will be forwarded to the Graduate School. All exceptions must ultimately be approl.'l!d by the Graduate School. nme Limitations Studenls have a seven-year time limit to complete all requiremenls for the Ph.D. degree. The seven-year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student was admitted to doctoral study and was completing work toward meeting the requiremenls for the degree. In the program lea<ing to the doctor's degree, up., forty-<>ight quarter or thirty-two semester cre<IIB of 'B' or better graduale credit earned prior to the student's admission as a doctoral applicant may be applied -ard the degree without regard to lapse of time. -Cracit earned beyond thirty-two cradilB may not be over ten years old at the time of admission. Credit earned after acoeptanoe as a Ph.D. applicant may not be over seven years old at the time the degree is conferred, except when, on the recommendation of the adviser, up to ten cracilB previously earned at Wayne Stale University may be specified for revalidation by examination. In the event that any courses have been previously revalidated in connection with the earning of the maslet's degree, these shall be counted as a part of the total len. Time extensions beyond these limitations are authorized only for condtions which are dearly beyond the student's control. Ph.D. Foreign Language Requirement The Ph.D. Foreign Language Requirement is a matter of departmental option. Students are advised to contact the department in which they intend to major in order to detennine the nature of the Ph.D. foreign language requiremant, W any, for that ciscipline. Doctoral studenlB should bear in mind that most departmenlB reserve the right to require foreign language proficiency for any Ph.D. student pursuing research which would benefit from the use of foreign languege materials, even though other students in the same Ph.D. program are not required to establish foreign language compatenoe. Residence The Ph.D. requirement of one year of residenoe is met by completion of at least six graduate credits in course work, exclusive of dissertation, in eadl of two successive semesters. The spring/summer semester may be excluded from the definition of successive semesters. Additional rasidenoe requirements may be imposed by the 32 General lnfonnalion Ph.D.-granting departments. The student should contact the major department to detennine what rasidenoe requirements must be satisfied. In the experimenlal sciences for which it can be demonsllaled that a student's research must be completed on campus, the rasidenoe requirement for the Ph.D. degree may be met by the dissenation ciractofs written certification that the student has been in lull-lime rasidenoe for at least two sucoessive semesters and one summer session. In this latter case, a count of course credits is not required for the fulfillment of the rasidenoe requirement but specific dates of rasidenoe must be furnished. In addition, the Ph.D. residenoe requirements stipulate that the student must elect at least thirty cradils in graduate work exclusive of cissenation ciractian at the Univarslty. Col/9ge of Nursing: Summer Option Ph.D. studenlB must complete a minimum of six graduate a-edits in course work, exclusive of cissertation aedit, in eadl of two successive summers. Individual Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program An incividual interdisciplinary Ph.D. program may be developed for a promising student with the approval of the graduate committees of participating departments and the Dean of the Graduate School. Ordinarily, the participating departmenlB will be no more than two, with one department having jurisdiction over an already approl.'l!d Ph.D. program; but proposals involving more than two departmenlB will be 'considered, providing that at least one department offers the Ph.D. degree. In reviewing a proposal for admission to the Individual Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program, the Graduate School will give considerable weight to the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The studenrs field of specialization will be designated by combining exisang departmental designations: e.g., chemislry and biology, or physics and mathematics. While individual interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs shall be governed by the same minimum Graduate School requirements established for all Ph.D. programs, the student petitioning for such a program must be advised thet achieving satisfactory depth as well as breadth in two fields of specialization may well require a greater extent of time, effort and expense than does the traditional Ph.D. degree conoentratad in a single department. Additional infonnation and program applications are available from the Ph.D. Office, Graduate School, 4327 Faculty/Administration Builcing. Adviser and Advisory Committees The Adviser represenlB the Department in helping plan the studenrs program. Additionally, the adviser shall approve the Plan of Worl<, recommend candidacy, guide the student's research, approve the dissertation, serve on the Oral Qualifying Examination Committee and doctoral cisser\\9tion committee, arrange for the qualifying examinations and Dissertation Public Lecture Presentation-Defense, and oertily to the Graduate School that degree requiremenlB have been fulfilled. The Qualifying Examining Committee must consist minimally of three major departmental members with approved graduate faculty starus. An extra-departmental member may be added at the discretion of the department In this latter instance, the department is encouraged to select a person from the student's minor/cognate area. The membership of this committee may not nonnally be changed until the qualifying examinations (written and orel) have been passed. The Dissertation Committee shall consist minimally of three major departmental members plus one extra-<lepartmenral member. The expertise of the extra-oopartmental member must be appropriate to the studenrs dissenation work. In the case of co-advisers from the same department the number of major departmental members shall be increased to four. After Graduate School approval, any changes in the committee structure shall require wrillen justification. Graduate Examiner The Graduate Examiner is appointed by lhe Graduate School and serves as the representative of lhe Graduate Council as presiding officer at bolh lhe Oral Qualifying Examination and lhe Dissertation Public LecbJre Presentation-Defense. The Graduate Examiner must be a tenured member of the Graduate Faculty in a depar1ment olher lhan lhat of lhe sbJdenrs major. The Graduate Examiner may not be a member of the sbJdent's cissertation committee. Qualifying Examinations Before taking lhe written and oral qualifying examinations, lhe sbJdent must have filed a Plan of Work wilh lhe Graduate School. The qualifying examination shall cover the appHc:ant's major and minor areas, and such olher related matters as lhe quaifying examining committee may presaibe.

Upon completion of lhe written part ol lhe Qualifying Examination lhe department shall n.otify lhe Graduate School of lhe anangements for the Oral Qualifying Examination (\\lia lhe Qualifying Examination Report Fonn) and submit lhe names of lhe members of lhe examining committee for approval. The Graduate School shall lhen appoint a Graduate Examiner for lhe committee. If the examining committee determines thatlhe applicant has not passed all parts of lhe written and oral examinations, the committee must make specific recommendations as to admitting the appWcant to a second examination and specify any additional wor1< lhat should be completed prior to such an examination. If lhe Graduate Examiner certifies lhat lhe student has failed lhe oral part of the examination, a second examination may not be held until at least one semester has elapsed, but must be held within one calendar year following the first examination. The same examining committee and Graduate Examiner must preside over both examinations. The second examination shall be considered final. Dissertation Public Lecture Presentation-Defense The dissertation .format and appearance must be acceptable ID lhe Graduate School before lhe Dissertation Public Lecture Presentation-Defense shaQ be aulhorized. Additionally, each Committee member must have certified, in writing, lhatthe dissertation has been read and approved for a Public LecbJre Presentation-Defense.

Commencement Information concerning commencement announcements, caps and gowns, invitations, tickets, time and place, assembling and other relevant items will be mailed to the graduates by the Commencement Office prior ID lhe event. Candidates for advanced degrees are requested and expaeted to attend the commencement at which the Universey confers upon them the honor of lhe degree eamed. Theses and Dissertations The presentation of a lhesis or dissertation generally brings ID a - the pursuit of either lhe master's or the doctoral degree. In essence such manuscripts represent a tangi~e summation of the many hours spent in study and research ID acquire a higher education. For lhil reason such seholal1y documents must evidence only the highest standards of research and writing. They must show consistency in punebJation, style and format. Advisers have primary responsibility for approval of the lhesis, but members of a doctoral committee must read, approve and sign the cissertalion. SUch approval includes an academic and professional evaluations and judgments as ID originafity, adequacy, accuracy, significance, mathodology, justification or conclusions encl correctness of style. Approval shall not be recorded until lhe woli< and manuscripts are fully verified and accepted. The thesis and dissertation should be selected and plamed wilh care; either may be of a research, expository or critical nature. Both must be an original work, in or related ID lhe sbJdenfs major fiald of specialization. Work submitted for aedit in other courses cannot be used in fuffilling lhesis or cissertation requirements. If proper standards of quality, objectivity, originalltY and independenca are maintained, the candidate may use data derived from other research he/she has conducted at the University. Neither the results of Iha research nor the publication of findings may be restricted by any non-University agency. The results of the research may be pubHshed prior to submission and acceptance of lhe lhesis or dissertation, in which case Graduate School notification is required. Format: Cancidates submitting manuscripts are instructed to lo\u00ad closely lhe Graduate School and college or school ragulationt goveming the format of lhe lhesis or dissertation. The UniversltY manuscript iormat guide may be obtained in the Graduate School. It is official policy lhat acceptance of a thesis or a dissertation, as wall certification of a candidate for a degree, shall not be granted unless a manuscript is technically correct in format and in a form suitable in all respects for publication.

These funds are provided ID ensure higher education opportinities ID eUgible students. Financial aid funds supplement the student's and the lamily's financial oontibution to educaticinal expenses. Soma financial aid programs are neecl-based; olhers are given in recognition of special skills, talents, or academic ability. There are lhree basic types of financial aid: 1) Gtanrs and Scholarships: gift assistance lhat requires no repayment and is usually based on need, academic achievement, or special talent; 2) Loans: money repayable with interest at a future date (usually following graduation or when lhe student ceases to be enrolled on at least a hall-lime basis) ; 3) Employment: a job on-or off--<:ampus, involving a direct exchange of money for work perfonned. Application Procedure: To receive consideration for 1996-97 financial aid, students must either complete lhe 1-7 Free AppHcalionforFederalStudentAid(FAFSA/orcompletelhe 1-7 FAFSA Re119W8I Application. To receive 1997-98 aid, students must either comple1e lhe 1997--98 Free Appllca~on for Federal 1997--98 Appllcatlon Deadlines: The 19-7 deadline for Wayne State University financial aid consideration is Mey 1, 1996 for fall and winter terms (except for loans and private scholarships, as explained below). The 1997-98 deacline for Wayne State financial aid is Mey 1, 1997, for fall and winter semes1ers (except for loans and private scholarships, as explained belo)v). To release application infonnation to Wayne State University, Ii$! lhe school code: 002329. (Nore: Applicants in lhe School of Medicine and lhe Law School should consult the financial aid offices in those schools for lhe appropriate codes.) Additional Appflcatlon Form and DeadllnN: The following types of financial aid require a separate application form in addition to lhe FA FSA or Renewal Application: Private Scholarships: available is April 30, 1996; lhe 1997-118 deadline is April 30, 1997. Federal Stafford Loans, subsidized and unsubsidized. The Wayne Stal& University Federal Stafford Loan Request Form 1-7, and lhe Wayne State University Federal Stafford Loan Request Form 1997--98 may be obtained from OSFA. The 1996-97 Stafford Loan deadlines are: Fall term 1996only:September 1, 1996; Fall tenn 1996 and Winter tenn 1997: November 1, 1996; Winter tenn 1997 only: November 1, 1996; Spring/Summer term 1997: March 15, 1997. The 1997-118 Stafford Loan deadlines are: Fall tenn 1997 only: September 1, 1997; Fall tenn 1997 and Winter tenn 1998: November 1, 1997; Wintertenn 15, 1998. will not process loan requests received after lhe appticetion deadlines. To remain eligible for Federal Stafford Loans, students must be enrolled at least ha/I-lime at the ~me of disbursement of funds. Verlllcatlon: The process by which a college or university confirms an individual student's FAFSA or Renewal Application is called verificatkm. A student whose application is selected for verification is required to provide documentation to OFSA that information reported on the financial aid application is accurate. For this purpose, the student will be asked to submit documents such as a copy of his or her (and the spouse's, if married) federal income tax retum or a statement oertifying non-tax-filer status, and/or other documenls pertaining to untaxed income (such es Social Security, Aid to Families with Dependent Children). Sadslllctory Acad11mlc Prograas: University standards of satisfactory academic progress govern all federal and state financial aid programs and Board of Governors scholarships and granls. To reoeive financial aid, an otherwise eligible student must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or oertifiicate. There are three elemenls in Wayne State standards: 1) Maximum program Cl9ditsforwhich a student may reoeive financial aid. Federal regulations establish the maximum time frame in which a student must complete his or her educational program es 150 per oent of the published length, in credils (credit hours), of the educational program. A student is not eligible for further financial essislanoe when the cumulative number of credit hours he or she attempts is equal to or greater than 150 per cent of the minimum aedils his or her major requires for graduation. (Example: lfastudenfsprogramrequires 120 credils for completion, when he or she attains 180 credils (120 x 150 = 180), his or her eligibility for financial aid ends.) For infonnation concerning the length of the program for which he or she is enrolled, a student should refer to the appropriate academic department sedion of the Undergraduate or Graduate Bulletin, as applicabte, or consult with an academic adviser. A student who is denied financial aid because he or she has exoeeded the established maximum time frame (credils) for completion of his or her educational program may submit an appeal to the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Committee; appeal forms are available from OSFA. A student should not assume the SAP Committee will reinslate his or her financial aid eligibility. 2) Credits earned per term (semester): A student must satisfactorily complete at least two-thirds of his or her attempted credit hours (credils) each tenn. (Example: If a student enrolls for twelve credils in a tenn, he/she must satisfactorily complete eight credils that tenn (12 x 2/3 = 8).) Attempted credits include all of the following marks and grades: 1) Earned aedils (A ihrough D), Pass (P), Satisfactory (S); 2) Not (N), Unsatisfadory (U); 3) Flepeated (R); 4) Wothdrawal (W); 5) Failure or F); 6) Incomplete (I); 7) No Grade (X); 8) Deferred Grade (Y); 9) Audit (Z); and 10) Transfer credit. A student who does not satisfadorily complete tw<>-lhirds of his/her attempted credils each school year is not eligible for further financial assistanca. To regain eligibility for financial aid denied on this basis, a student must either: a) receive approval by the SAP Committee of the student's appeal of the\u00b7 denial of financial aid (appeal forms are available from OSFA); orb) successfully meet the University academic process standards duming a subsequent enrollment at Wayne $\u00ad University (paid for by the student's resources). 3) Cumulative honor point average. An undergraduate student must mainlain at least a 2.0 cumulative honor point average (h.p.a.); a student whose cumulative h.p.a. falls below 2.0 is not eligible for further financial assistance; he/she must attain a 2.0 h.p.a. to regain eligibility for financial aid. NOTE: Gra<Nate Students, law students, and medical students should confer with their aciademic advisers for information concerning the minimum acoeplable h.p.a in their programs. A student cannot receive financial aid retroactively for the academic period in which he/she /'fHJstablishes satisfactory academic progress. A student who does not meet the required academic progress standards may appeal, under special circumstances, for financial aid reinstatement. OSFA may consider, es a besis for appeal, circumstances beyond the student's control which affected his/her academic achievement. Conlact the OSFA for appeal fonns \u00b7 and prooedures. Flnanclal Aid Dlabur-11: Federal Sia fiord Loans are disbufsed in two paymenls, regardless of the length of the loan period. AH other financial aid is disbursed in two paymenls W the award is for an academic year, and in one payrd is for a semester. \u00b7 Withdrawal -Refunds and Repoymenll: Financial aid recipienls who wilhaaw from classas may be required to repay a portiion of the aid reoeived. OSFA s11'0ngly urges studenls to discuss with a financial aid administrator the effect withdrawing from classes wUI have on financial aid, before they implement the change. Alter officially withdrawing from classes, studenls must immedialely notify OSFA of their enroUment slatus change. Copies of complete refund and repayment policies are available from OSFA. Refunds -First-T,me Students: Pursuant to_ the Higher Education Act of 1992, the University utilizes the pro rata refund policy for first-time students who receive financial aid and withdraw on or before the sixty per cent point of the enrollment period. Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the OSFA. Acadamlc Status Eligibility: To reoeiva consideration for the maximum award amounts under financial aid programs, students must enroll full time. At the graduate level, enrollment for eight credils is lull-time enrollment; enrollment for four credits is part-time. Studenls who enroll less than full time but at least half time are eligible for financial aid in pro rata amounts. Eligible Program Exceptions: To reoeive financial aid, an applicant must be enrolled at least half time in an eligible program, that is, a program that leads to a degree or certificate. There are three exceptions to the eligible program requirement: 1) Prerequisite course work: Studenls enrolled at least half time in courses which are required prerequisites to an eligible program are eligible for Federal Family Education Loans; the courses must be part of an eligible program. These studenls are eligible for loans for one consecutive twelve-month period beginning the first day of the loan period for which they are enrolled. Federal regulations stipulate that studenls enrolled in prerequisite course work are oonsidered first y\u00ad undergraduates; thus, the $2,625 Federal Slafford Loan limit applies. 2) Teachercer1ilica1k,n: Studentsenrolledatleasthalftimeincourses that are required for initial elementary or secondary teacher osrtification or for recertification are eligible for Federal Family Education Loans. Federal regulations stupulate that studenls enrolled in teacher oertification programs are considered fifth-year undergraduates; thus, the $5,500 Federal Stafford Loan Hmtt applies. Note: Optional courses that a student elecls to lake for professional reoognition or advanosment, or that a Wayne State adviser recommends, are not included in this exception. 3) School of Medicine: Consult the School of Medicine for details regarding post--bachelo(s study and financial aid. Federal regulations stipulate that OSFA must maintain documentation of the above-slated exoeptions. That is, for financial aid applicanls who are not enrolled in programs leading to a degree or certificate, OSFA mu$1 obtain proof of enrollment on one of the three exceptions. The Eligible Program Exceptions Fonn, available from the OSFA, must be completed by the appropriate college or department and retumed to OSFA. Program Ineligible for Rnandal Aid: OSFA will deny financial aid to studenls with the following visa or program status: lnellgible Not>--Citizens: This includes individuals who are in the United States on only: a) an F1 or F2 student visa; b) a J1 or J2 exchange visitor visa; or c) a G series visa (pertaining to international organizations).

Institute of was created in 1965 by the Wayne State University Board of Governors in response to a mandala of the Stale of Michigan. Its mission is to disoover, synthesize, and disseminate data and information which will 1) increase knowledge about aging and rela18d prooesses; 2) improve the practice of gerontology and geriatrics; and 3) influence the development and implementation of public policy. The dynamic coalition of researchers and educators from multiple disciplines believes that this mission can best be accomplished by interdisciplinary collaboration and participation in the oolturally-dverse urban environment. Five areas of expertise are emphasized: family and in18rgenerational relationships; health and health care; human development and expression; independenoe and productivity; and gerontological education. The Institute a) conduels basic and applied research on individual and population aging among diverse social groups in varying social settings, such as families or institutions; b) collabora18s with University faculty and community-based coReagues ID stimulate research and leaching on\u00b7 gerontological issues; c) praparas practitioners, researchers, and students ID contribute lo the field of geronlology; d) disseminales dale and information on garontological issues to ciwrse audiences (such as older people and their families, researchers, practitioners, and !hose who influence public policy); and e) promoles lhe building and strenglhening of public and privale support for agin~laled activities. The lnstitule seeks ID contribule to an enhanced quality of life for older people, especially lhose in lhe Oelroit area and in Michigan. It focuses specific -ntion on understancing and reprasenting urban minority populations in a culturally-unsitive andtheoreticsly relevent manner. A limiled number of graduate research assistantships are available each year. - Graduate Certificate in Gerontology The Graduate Certificate in Gerontology program is a multidisciplinary program administered through the institute and the Graduate School. The program is designed ID inlegrate garontology into the studenrs primary discipline by providing a substantive foundation in gerontological course work and an intensive intemship experience. The cel1ificale may be earned concurrently with a graduale degree, or may be earned independently by students who have completed an advanced degree.. Three joint programs also assist concurrent students in earning the csrtificale along with degrees in the foHowing majors: Masler of Scienca in Community Health Services, Masler of Science in Occupational Therapy, or Master of Arts in Recraation and Perk Services. Admlaolon: Applicants must meet the admission standards for Graduale School; for requirements, see page 17.

CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS: Gerontology education is defined es the study of the proceeses of aging, including lhe biological,behavioral, social, and public policy aspeclB of later life. It encompasses both knowledge (gerontology course work) and practice (service to older people and their families). The Graduale Certificate Program is structurad to include both of these orientations, requiring completion of fifteen cradits of academic course work and lhree credits in internship experience. When students earn the certificate concunenlly wttha degree, nine of theeighleen credits may be used to meet both degree and cartificate requirements. Each student develops a Plan of Work in consultation with the program ciractor. Course work requirements inck.Kle successful completion, with a grade of 'B' or above, of one approved course from each of the live designaled calegOries, below. Each year, approximalely twenty graduate gerontology courses are available in various academic araes, including sociology, psychology, social work, nursing, political science, biology, occupational lherapy, recreation and park services, speech, and community meciclne. (Other courses may also be ollerad on an occesional basis which satisfy program requirements.) The internship is a plannad, exlended learning activity designed to enhance compelence in garontology while offering the opportunity ID integrale theory wtth practioe. The internship is planned cooperatively by the studen~ department adviser (ff appropriate), and cartilicate , program director, after the student has oompleted a minimum of three gerontology courses.

Edwards The Humantties Center was established by the Board of Governors in 1993. Its purpose is to promote and fund faculty and graduate student scholarship in the humanities. The Center particularly encourages interdisciplinary research by bringing humanists in different disciplines togelher and by encouragfng interdisciplinary research projects. The Cenle~s definition of the humanities is lhat of Iha National Endowment for Iha Humanities, namely: comparative religion, elhics, philosophy, archaeology, classical and modem languages, inguistics, jurisprudence, history, lilerature, history and criticism of Iha arts, and lhose social sciences which employ historical and philosophical approaches such as cultural anlhropology, inlemational relations, political science, or sociology. lnlerdisciplinary projects involving two or more of these disciplines are encouraged. The Center is administered by the Vice President for Research or his/her designee, and has an Advisory Board President oomprising faculty nominated by faculty, chairpersons, and deans. The Advisory Board annuaUy identifies a theme or toQic that is pertinent to the humanistic disciplines and invites research proposals addressing that the,:ne or topic from faculty and graduale students. The Center also provides support for visiting research scholars from national or international universities, and for conferences and publications. Center for International Business Education and Research 100 Rands House; and Research (CIBER) was estabfishad by lhe University Board of Governors in August 1991. Its purpose is to foster inleruniversity research programs, advance globalization of students, promote lhe instiMion of faculty development programs in multinational firms, infuse cross~ationat or comparative themes into existing courses, establish ~nkages with the Detroit~ business community, and enhance tntemationalization of the entire university community through symposia, conferences, and exchange programs. CIBER coordinates joint research activities and is spearheading Iha effort to launch new interdisciplinary courses within the University. While Iha Cenler is administered by the School of Business Administration, Center activities and programs involve other schools, colleges and cenlers of the University as well as olher universities and institutions. CIBER will function as a clearinghouse for information on international business activity, cunent international business topics, and lhe interdisciplinary filerature which provides Iha foundation for the international business field. The Center is cunenify organizing an inlemational business Hbrary and has established a discussion paper 44 General ln/ormalipn and lecture series on relevant international business issues. Other aclivilies of the Center include generating student internship and faculty fellowship programs and conducting research for lhe inlBmational business community. Center for Judaic Studies, establishad in 1988 as a cooperative venture between Wayne Stele University and the Jewish Foundation of Metropolitan Detroit/United Jewish Foundation, rellects and embo<ies Iha fruitful relationship which has long linked the University to lhe Jewish community of lhe metropolilan Detroit area. Although the Cenler is an academic untt of Wayne State, it offers no instruction, awards no degrees, and grants no certificates. It serves, rather, as a University~munity resource in Judaica and related arsas. M such, tt promoleS and publicizes course offerings, and it sponsors a broad array of programs and activities related to several of the University's wide-ranging missions - from inlernational conlarancas, at which leading scholars explore issues at lhe cutting adge of cunent research in Judaica, to smaller symposia, incidental lectures, residencies, and broady-<lefined cultural events. It its brief history, Iha Center has brought some of the wor1d\u00b7s most distinguished academics to lhe campus and community and has hos tad a number of equally eminent writers, peels, artists and m~sicians. Since its inception, Iha Cenler has carved a modest but significant niche for itseff in lhe world of Jewish scholarship and letters. lnternationaUy, it has 00-5ponsored programs wilh Oxford University and the Universities of London and Tel Aviv. Nationally, it has sponsorad activities lhat have attracted attention and earned respect at leading cenlers of Jewish learning across Iha country. Locally, it has helpad develop and establish courses and seminars for Jewish leachers and professionals; tt has also arranged programming for a broad spectrum of Nlterest groups and various student populations. Working independendy. the Center sponsors regional events which address the needs of the Jewish community. Working cooperatively, it plans programs and coordinates programming activities wilh neighborhood institutions of higher aducation to a degree rare among academic centers of Judaic studies. lndead, its signijicant and systematically-planned outreach mission reflects the creative vision lhat makes Wayne State a national leader in the area of univers~munity relations. In lhis regard, the Coh~addow Cenler works ciligentlt and consciously to provide a model for universtties and Jewish communities striving to develop and establish oomparable units devoted to Judaic studies.

When an essay or a thesis is authorized by an adviser, strict adherence to the provisions set forth in an accepted handbook of style is required of all studenls. Essays and theses must be approved in final draft form before the end of the semester prior to that in which it is expected that the degree will be granted. Degrees are granted upon the recommendation of the faculty of the Scho~ of Business Administration. Consideration is given both to scholastic achievement and to the standards and rules of the School. All course work must be completed in accordance with the regulations of the Graduate School and the School of Business Adminisbation goveming graduate scholarship and degrees: see pages 23--34 and 63, respectively. Joint J.D./M.B.A Program The Joint J.DJM.B.A. Program leads to the receipt of both the Juris Doctor (J .0.) degree from the Law School and the Master of Business Administration (M.BA) degree. Applicanis to this program must apply to both the Law School and the School of Business Administration. Students must take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMA T) as part of the M.B.A. application process. Admission to the JointJ.0./M.B.A. Program requires separate approval by both the Law Schoof and the School of Business Adminisbation. The first year of study is spent in the Law School; after completion of the first year, students may elect one course per semester, uptoa total of four graduate courses in the Business School, credit for-which is applicable toward the J.D. degree. Studenls may also apply a maximum of two Law School oourses (six credits) as M.B.A. elective credit. Course Distribution Requirements The master's degree program provides a common body of knowledge in business adminisbation as well as opportunities for advanced specialization in particular areas. The program beyond the common body of knowledge is broad in nature and is directed at general competence for overall management. There are three phases of course work required: foundation, core, and concenbation/elective. Depending on the student's background, no foundation course work or as many as ten foundation courses may be required. All students must complete eight core and four concentration/elective courses. - Foundation Requirements Of the following foundation couraes, those at the 600 level are open only to students who have been formally admitted to a graduate program at Wayne State University undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and non~atriculated students are not eligible. (Analogous coursas offered at the undergraduate level may be taken to satisfy Foundation Requiremenls prior to graduate admission. However, once a student has been for.mally admitted to the M.B.A. program, NO graduate credit shall be allowed for subsequent registrations in undergraduate courses analogous to the Graduate Foundation Requiremenls w~hout approval of the Graduate Committee or its designee. Information regarding such courses is available in the Office of Student Services, 103 Prentis Building.) All foundation requirements must be completed before a student begin core, concentration and elective couraea. K.c 601 . and P<>icils In addition to these courses, one college-tevel mathematics oourse is requil9d. While all of the above foundation coursas are required, studenls who have had equivalent course work in their\u00b7 undergraduate programs may be granted waivers of certain foundation courses at the time of their admission to the graduate program.-ln general, a baccalaureate degree in Business Administration from a regionally accredited institution fulfills most or all foundation requiremenls. However, each applicant's background will be individually examined by the Graduate Committee or its designee to determine 1f any foundation course work is needed. (The Graduate Commitee is chaired by the Dean or his/her designee.) If oourses proposed to satisfy the foundation requirements of the M.B.A. program are over six years old, the Graduate Committee may require the applicant to demonsbate proficiency in the subject matter either by interview with a faculty member, by taking an equivalent course, or by taking an equivalent course by examination. A cumulative honor point average of 3.00 ('B') is required for foundation requiremenls. No individual grade below 2.0 ('C') is acceptable. - Core Requirements The following eight core courses are required of all students: . . . . Marketing Strategy MGT 789, Seminar in Business Policy, is to be taken in the final twelve credils of the graduate program and only after the completion of the other seven core courses. For those students with an undergraduate major in accounting, finance, management or marketing, a more advanced course in a subject area must replace the pertinent core course noted above. Studenls may petition the Graduate Committee or its designee to make a course substitution appropriate to their professional objectives. This substitute core course cannot satisfy the ooOC8ntration/elective requirements. - Concentration/Elective Requirements The purpose of the concentration requirement is to provide depth in a specialization that will contribute to the student's attainment of his or her professional objectives. The elective course work is designed to provide additional breadth in the student's program. School of Business Administration 59 A concenlration area consists of at least two courses (at the 700 level or above) selected to meet the particular professional needs of the student. The choice of a concentration area should be made at the time of application or as soon as possible alter admission to the program. The choice must be made before the completion of twelve credits in course wOl'k at the 700 level or higher. Students must also take two elective courses at the 700 level or higher. One elective may be taken in the concentration area if the student desires additional depth in the specialization. However, at leaet one elective mu11 be taken outlide the 1tudent'1 area of concentration. (Students in the International Business concentration may take both electives in this area, because of its interdisciplinary nature.) The student may wish to consult one or more graduate advisers before selecting his/her concentration and elective course wOl'k. The written approval of the Dean or his/her designea is required to take any course outsipe the School of Business Administration. Listed below are courses available in the concentration areas. Students may, with their adviser's prior approval, select different combinations of concentration courses within a department.

Wood Foreword The College of Education at Wayne State University is located in, and serves the needs of, one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas. Thus, the College reflects the dynamic character of urban life, and, in its concern with urban problems, places great faith in education as the means by which human circumstances can be improved. To this end, the College prepares professional educators who have the commitment and competence to help young people achieve dignity, preserve individuality, develop democratic values, and find se!Hulfillment. As society has been altered by such factors as the development of knowledge, technologicai advances and population growth, the purposes and processes of education have changed. New technologies of instruction are evolving rapidly and offer the educator many opportunities for developing a high level of competence. Problems generated in our urban society are complex, and those related to education are no exception. Yet, the opportunities for curriculum innovation, experimentation and leadership have never been greater. Accreditation The programs of the College of Education have been accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education since 1954. The College has been reaccredited regiJarly since that time. Full accreditation for its programs was again granted in 1993 for a seven-year period. In addition, Wayne State University is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.

(T) College of Education 119 COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING INTERIM DEAN: Kenneth Kline FOREWORD Graduate eciJcation is important to the engineer interested in keeping pace wilh rapid growth in science and technology and in preparing for changes in job responsibilities. In the midst 0:f greater Detroit's large community of professional engineers, Wayne State University's College of Eng_ineering has an important mission to provide opportunities for study in contemporary areas and 'the latest developmenls in technology. The College of Engineering is a leading research institution in Mtchigan and the nation. This is reflected in its instructional programs which are supported bolh by ,ils own research and by !hat of olher institutions, and in Iha suitability of ils induslrial/educational environment for advanoed study. Engineering graduate studenls are drawn both from the upper ranks of graduating seniors in various disciplines, and from established engineers pursuing advanced degrees. Criteria for admission are restrictive, and a high standard of performance is expected of suocessful candidates. In shon, lhe challenges are great, but the potential rewards are equally promising. Graduate Degree Programs The College of Engineering offers lhe Master's and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in chemical, civil, computer, eleclrical, industrial, mechanical, and materials science and engineering; and a Master's Degree in aectronics and computer control systems, eng.ineering management, engineering technology, hazardous waste management, manufacturing engineering, and operations research. These programs are generally described below, and specifically in Iha subsequent departmental secttons. The College provides support for the various instructional and research laboratories\u00b7 in the construction, modification, repair, calibration and installation of experimantal equipment. In addition, Iha College offers sophisticated assistance in the design of etectronic and instrumentation equipment and devices. Qualified students use these facilities under the supervision of trained professionals. Excellent research programs are available in this college; graduate ~tudents can write a thesis or cissertation based on their participation ,n lhese programs to fulfill part of !heir degree requiremenls. Man~ graduate students pursue !heir studies in Iha College while working ful~ or part-time in local industry, where they have available to lhem unique facilities not found within Iha University. Stu den ls in such situations are encouraged to pursue their graduate research at their places of employment, under the joint supervision of the faculty adviser and a company representative. SUch research may be applicable as crecit earned for cirected study courses, master's theses, or doctoral dissertations. However, after completion of a Bachelor of Science degree and ona or more years of on-th&-job experience, additional training at the graduate level is often desirable, without participation in a research program, and Iha College provides an optional master's degree program without a thesis research requirement. Graduate Certificate Programs: The Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science offers four certificate programs. For information and requirements, see page 127. 122 College o/Enginuring Graduate Degrees and Certificates MASTER OF SCIENCE in Chemical Engineering Civil Engineering Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering Electronics and Computer Control Systems Engineering Management Engineering Technology Hazardous Waste Management Industrial Engineering Manufacturing Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Mechanical Engineering Operations Research DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY in Chemical Engineering Civil Engineering Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Mechanical Engineering GRADUATE CEKI'lFlCATE PROGRAMS in Environmental Aud~ing Hazardous Waste Control Hazardous Materials Management on Public Lands Polymer Engineering Research Centers, Programs, and Laboratories Opportunities exist at bolh Iha graduate and advanced undergraduate levels for studenls to participate in Iha programs of Iha research centers. The Bloenglnrlng Center is an interdisciplinary group engaged in biomedical research, utilizing Iha principl_es of mechanical, chemical, eleclrical, and computer engineering. Faculty from Iha College of Engineering collaborate with colleagues from Iha Wayne State Medical School in joint efforts to solve bolh basic and clinical problems. The principal area of research in the Center is automotive sakny, but many other lines of investigation are also pursued. Major areas of research include trauma biomechanics, mechanical bases for low back pain, human locomotion studies, and orthopedic biomechanics. Other activities include the development of advanced anthropometric test dummies and impact studies using horizontal accelerator test sleds. The Center for Automotive Research coordinates a variety of programs in different automotive areas, such as combustion engines, dynamk;s, acoustics, vibrations, and electronic controls. The engine research deals wilh Iha basic processes of thermodynamics, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemk:al kinetics which affect the performance, fuel economy, startability and emissions of dttferent types of engines. The fully-instrumented oold room is used for some of these studies. Research is also conducted on diesel engine combustion and alternate fuels. The research consists of extensive lheoretical analysis, supported by experimental investigations. The Center combines expertise from the Departments of Medlanical, Chemical, and Eleclrical and Computer Engineering. Curremly restricted 10 elf1)1oyees of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Land Managemert. The Machine Tool Laboratory in lhe College of Engineering has been organized wilh lhe goel of developing a bettar balance -n hardware and software, utilizing hands-oo approaches, and focusing on prototype development The laboratory is suppoded by faculty in four departments of lhe College.

Bhatti, John Hartig, Byung Kim, hving Salmecn Graduate Degrees MASTER OF SCIENCE in Civil Engineering DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Civil Engineering The urban crisis in America has brought into sharp focus the professton of civil engineering and the responsibilities of its praditioners. The civil engineer is a leader in such diverse areas of concern as the design of strudural systems; water resources planning; the treatment and ultimate disposal of noxious solid and liquid wastes; design of building systems which will provide adequate housing for urban dwellers, commerce and industry; the development of adequate transportation systems; construction methods and management; and the implementation and management of public works infrasb'uetura projects designed to improve lhe urban environment. Obviously, the responsibilities of lhe civil engineer directly involve lhe heallh, salety and welfare of the public. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers graduate degree programs in which students may specialize in the following areas: strucbJres, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, and transportation. Master of Science in Civil Engineering The civil engineering graduate program at Wayne State University has tracltionally attracted students employed by local industries and government. This program is designed to accommodate the needs of bolh lul~time on-campus students and part-time students concurrendy employed by local industry or government. To this end, a majority of graduate classes are held in lhe evening. Alternatively. lul~time students have the opportunity to participate in research and experimental work with lhe faculty, while pursuing their graduate courses. Admission to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17. Additionally, all applicants must satisfy the following: 1. The student must have an undergraduate engineering degree from an institution accredited by lhe Aocrediting Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) or from a comparable foreign institution. In the event that the degree is in some field other than civil engineering, the student may be requirad ID complete a set of prerequisite undergraduate courses before graduate degree credit may be accrued. Only in exeptional cases will students without an undergraduate engineering background be admitted ID the civil engineering graduate program, but in such cases significant undergraduate prerequisite course work will be neoessary. 2. The student must have an overall honor point average (h.p.a.) of 3.0 for regular admission. Qualified or probationary admission may be granted ID students with a lower h.p.a. Conditions of such admissions are specifically mandated and \u00b7 applicants should contact the Department for details. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The Master of Scienoe is offerad by this department under the following options: Pim, A: Thirty-4wo credits including an eight credit thesis. P'/an C: Thirty-two credits of course work. For either plan, credits must be disbibuted as foUows: at least twenty credits must be taken in the major (C E courses), of which six credits must be eamad in courses numberad 700-$9, and twelve credits win constitute a core ID be selected from one of the following areas: Environmental Engif)88ring, Geotedlnic:al Engineering, Structures, Transportation. For specific departmental requirements, students should consult the current issue of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Graduate Student Handbook. Sb.Iden ts must maintain a grade of 'B' or better in all core courses. The credit distribution requirements do not include thesis credit for Plan A candidates. Within the first eight to twelve credits in graduate work, the student should file an adviser-approved Plan of Work. Allcourseworkmustbe completed in accordance with the regulations of the Graduate School and the College of Engineering governing graduate scholarship and degreas; see pages 23-34 and 123--125, respectively. Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in Civil Engineering The Department offers doclDral programs in all the major areas Hsted as core specializations under the Master of Science degree (see above). Admlaolon to this program is contingent upon admission ID the GraduateSchool;forrequirements, see page 17. For admission to the Ph.D. program, the student's overall honor point averaga must be 3.2 or better, and 3.4 in the last two years as an undergraduate student. Students who do not satisfy these minimum standards wil not be considarad for admission to the program until they have completed an M.S. degree and have earned an honor point average in courses taken for graduate credit which is not less than 3.5. Fellowship and assistantship support is available for qualified graduate students; see page 34. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Candidates for the doctoral degrea must complete ninety credits beyond the baccalaureate, induding thirty credits of dissertation direction, and sixty credits of course work and directed study. All doctoral studants are required ID submit a Plan of Work indicating their course work (with major/minor designation), and developed in consultation with an adviser.

Mejabi, Kai Yang Adjunct Professor Marietta Baba Graduate Degrees MASTER OF SCIENCE in Industrial Engineering MASTER OF SCIENCE in Manufacturing Engineering MASTER OF SCIENCE in OperaJions Research MASTER OF SCIENCE in Engineering Management DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Industrial Engineering Tracitionally, the manufacturing engineer was responsible for developing lhe process capability to realize the output of design engineering. Today, however, lhe boundary between design and manufacturing engineering is becoming blurred. Both groups work together in teams to assure the soundness of design and producibility of product. The manufacturing engineer must have an understanding of lhe design process, but lhe special expertise which is brought by lhe manufacturing engineer is the knowledge and understanding of lhe producticn process. Today's production is computer-based and provides flexibility through numerical control. The manufacturing engineer is responsible for designing and implementing lhe cells and prockJction lines which become the basic units of manufacture. Increasingly, such production Units are becoming parts of an integrated factory system, and are not simply islands of automation. The manufacturing engineer must understand the multi-layered control architecture of lhe integrated factory, and lhe computer-based technologies which enable it. The industrial engineer is a broadly-trained integration engineer, concerned with enabling complex systems to function effectively. Managing the inventory of a production facility, for example, involves issues of production and stocking policy, manufacturing equipment, human resources, customer demand, and supplier relationships. The industrial engineer must understand the interaction of the components of a system, and coordinate the flow of materials and information to effectiwly manage the operation. The industrial engineer plays an important role in defining information needs and developing strategies for dec:ision making based on incomplete knowledge. However, lhe skills of lhe indusbial engineer have much greater application lhan to traditional production environments. In a growing service sector of the economy induding heallh care delivery, public safety, air transportation, and banking, for example, issues of resource management, sdleduling, quality of service, and systems design are important.. The Depanment maintains laboratories in systems simulation, cornputer_.,ided manufacluring, and concurrent engineering design. Part-time programs of study allowing sbJdents to continue lulHime employment in local industries ara available. Most of !he COUIS8S in lhese programs ara offered in lhe evening, and some programs ara offered at off-campus sites.

Admission to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of lhe program, applicants whose undergraduate education is deficient in prerequisites for graduate classes may be required to take background courses which will NOT count toward lhe lhrity-two credit degree requirement. Students whose background preparation does not include manufacturing processes must take I E 345. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS; The Master of Sciencs in Manufacturing Engineering is offered under lhe following options: Plan A; Thirty-two credits including an eight credit thesis.

Magidson Foreword The College of Fine, Perfonning and Communication ArlS at Wayne State University has as its mission the provision of the highest quality education for practitioners, scholars and oonsumers in art, art history, communication, dance, music and theatre. This education leads to careers, uses for the arts in other disciplines, enhanced aitical abilities, the enrichment of everyday lije and the builcing of new generations of artisls, professionals and scholars. The College serves the University and the larger community by creating parblerships that emphasize its own rich, diverse curriculum, interdisciplinary studies, reciprocal professional interaction and outreach activities appropriate to each area of work. Special emphasis is placed on forging alliances with local, state and national constituencies sudl that the College is both a leader and a resource providing expertise, infonnation and guidance. Within an appropriate and attractive academic environment the College promotes an abnosphere conducive to intellectual and artistic growth, risk-taking and personal and professional development at all levels in both individual and collaborative endeavois. This environment also assists the C~lege in its role as a national center for creative, research and teaching excellence. As the cultural conscience of the Univeisity, the College provides public events and curricular offerings that nurture creative development, enrich aesthetic values and sensitivity, heighten awareness of the arts experience and reflect the disciplinary diversity of its areas of study. Cultural, racial, ethnic and gender diversity is an important commibnent in public events and educational efforts. Ultimately, the mission of the College is to focus on the integration of theory and practice through the creation, discovery, preservation and transmission of knowledge in the fine, performing and communication arlS. Cempu Reaourcea: Traditional courses of sbJdy are augmented by a variety of performance and presentation resources considered integral to many of the creative programs. Included in these are the Hilberry Repertory Theatre, the Wayns State University Dance Company, the Symphonic Band and Univeisity Orchestra, the Intercollegiate Debate Team, plus Community ArlS Gallery exhibitions which often feature work created by studenls and studio faculty. These are only a few of the campus resouroes that are especially important for majors in the CoUege. A more comprehensive listing can be found under each of the specific departments. Detroit Resource&: The proximity of the Wayne campus to institutions of the Detro~ Cultural Center (which includes the Detroit Institute of ArlS, the Center for Creative Studies, and Orchestra Hall, among other instibJtions) provides further unique and enriching benefits for students; professional staff members of these instibJtions often serve as adjunct feculty in College of Fine, Performing and Communication Arts programs. Nearby, too, are major print and electronic communtcations resources that similar1y provide both adjunct faculty and professional assistance to yet other programs in the college. Accrediting Agencieo: Programs offered by the Music Department are accrecited by the National Association of Schools of Music, and the National AssociattOn of Music Therapy.

Regular Admission -See page 17. In the selective admission of graduate students, preference is given to those students who have achieved superior undergraduate scholastic records and who evidence superior artistic abilities. If a student's undergraduate preparation is considered deficient for advanced work in his/her major field, additional work may be required at the undergraduate level. All prerequisite aedils must be earned prior to or concurrent with the first graaJate credits. Certain degrees have additional requirements as stated in the following pages. Graduate Scholarship Graduate degraes are conferred not merely upon lhe completion of a presaibed number of courses nor necessarily after a given period of residence, but rather in recognition of each candidate's outstanding ability and high attainments as evidenced in all course work, research, scholarly writing, examinations, personal fitness for a chosen profession, and promise of professional competence. All course work must be completed in accordance with the academic regulations of the Graduate School (see \u00b7 pages 23-34), as well as College and Departmental regulations governing graduate sdlolarship and degrees. GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS General requiramenls for graduate degrees may be found beginning on page 23. In addition to these and to the information. below, other requiremenls are specified by the individual graduate depertmen1s. Studenls should consult the program and requiremenls of the departmenls in which they plan to major. \u00b7 Candidacy is an advanced status which is recommended by the student's adviser and authorized by the Graduate School or the Oean of the College of Fine, Performing and CQmmunication Arts upon evidence of the applicant's superior scholarship, appropriate personal qualities and promise of professional competence. Admission as an applicant does not assure acceptance as candidate for a degree. Also, camidacy is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for graduation. To be eligible for candidacy, the student must file an official approved Plan of Work. The Plan of Work should provide for effective concentration in a major field, with proper supporting courses in related fields. All master's applican1s should file the Plan of Work with the graduate officer of the College of Fine, Performing and Communication Arts. In preparing a Plan, studenls should evaluale with care their personal and professional objectives as weH as all degree and departmental requiremenls. Normally, studenls enrolled in master's degree programs are expected to file a Plan of Work by the time the equivalent of eight to twelve graduate cradits have been earned. In the Master of Fine Arts program, however, the Plan of Work should be filed by the time the equivalent of fourteen to eighteen credils have been earned. Candidacy must be authorized by the time twelve to eighteen graduate credils have been earned (dependent upon the applicant's degree program) or subsequent registration may be denied. Plans are filed with the College's graduate officer. Once the Plan of Work has been approved, the fonn to change the student's rank from 'applicant' to 'candidate' will be procassed by the College Graduate Officer. Ph.O. applicanls should file the Plan of Work with the Graduate School, when approximately forty aedils beyond the baocalaureate degree have been earned. In addition to filing the Plan, the student must have satisfied the foreign language requiremenls, must have passed the Final Qualifying Examination (written and oral), and must have submitted and received the Graduate Oean's approval on the Oissertation Oudine before the doctoral committee will recommend candidacy. Commencement: Information concerning commencement announcements, caps and gowns, invitations, tickets, time and place, assembling and other relevant items will be mailed to graduates by the Class Board prior to the event. Candidates for advanced degraes are requested and expected to attend the commencement at which the University confers upon them the honor of the degree earned. Master's Degree Requirements In the Master of Arts and Master of Music programs, the minimum requirement for the degree is thirty-two aedils under one of the following plans: Plall A: Twenty-four credils in thesis. Plan B: Twenty-nine credils in three-credit essay. P'lan C: Thirty-two credils in course work. This plan is authorized only in selected areas. The essay or thesis is not required for this plan,\u00b7 however, most departmenlS require a {Ullll comprehensive examination. Students should consult an adviser for details. These requiremenls vary slighdy depending on the department and major curricLJlum; students should see the degree programs outlined in the following pages for specific infonnation. COURSE REQUIREMENTS: At least twenty-four aedlls must be taken in resktence. At least six credits in the major field, in addition to the essay or thesis, must be in courses open only to graduate students (700 and above). Master of Fine Arts Degree. Requirements In lhe Master of Fine Arts degree programs, the minimum requirement indudes fifty-four to sixty graduate credils plus a final project completed under Plans B or C as follows: Plan B: Sixty credits including a three-credit essay. This plan is open only to studio art majors. Plan C: Fifty-fow to sixty credits, depending on the studenl' s major, including a final project.

Doctoral Degree Requirements Candidates for the doctoral degree must complete ninety aedits beyond the baocalaureate degree induding thirty credils of dissertatK>n direction. - Examinations Preliminary Ouallfyfng Examlnatlona: Responsibility for the requirement of a preliminaoy qualifying examination is vested in the graduate faculty of each department and specifically its committee on doctoral. study. Accordingly, each committee may require this examination of all of its candidates oi' of any candidate at any time it may determine prior to the final qualifying examination. Collt:gt: of Fint:, Pt:rforming, and Communication Arts 155 Final Quallfylng Examination: The final qualifying examination is required of each applicant. The applicant may request his/her doctoral committee to authorize the final qualifying examination after an approved Plan of Work has been filed with the Graduate School, AND after the Dean of the Graduate School has approved the Disserta~on Outline. The examination will be in part written and in part oral. When this examination has been passed, the applicant will be advanced to the status of 'doctoral candidate\u00b7. The written qualifying examination will cover the applicant's major and minor areas and may include such other related matters as the doctoral examining committee may prescribe. Within thirty days after the written examination has been passed, the oral qualifying examination will be conducted by the doctoral examining committee, in the presence of the chairperson of the departmental committee on doctoral study or his/her designee and a graduate examiner approved by the Graduate School. This examination will relate to the subject matter of the written examination, the applicant's major and minor areas and other pertinent matters. If an examining committee-does not certify that the applicant has been passed in either the written or oral examination, it must make specific recommendations with reference to admitting the applicant to a second examination and specify any additional work that should be completed prior to such an examination. If a second examination is held, it must be scheduled within one calendar year and shall be considered final. The student's doctoral committee is selected at the time the doctoral Plan of Work is prepared. At this time, and upon consultation with the chairperson of the student's doctoral committee, a member outside of the student's major deparbnent is appointed to the committee by the Graduate School. This appointed representative is expected to meet as a member of the student's committee while the research and preparation of the dissertation are in process. He/she, akmg with all members of the committee, will also be present at the final oral presentation. The graduate examiner files a brief report to the Graduate School detailing the oonduct of the oral presentation. - Essays, Theses, and Dissertations There is no prescribed form for the essay. Title page format as given in the Graduate School's Guide for Preparing Theses and Dissertations may be used for essays. Standard style manuals may be consulted for form, as desired by the student or department. The original ccpy of the essay shculd be submitted to the Fine, Performing and Communication Arts Graduate Officer after it is approved and signed by the adviser. This copy will be returned to the department within a reasonable time after the student's graduation date. The thesis or dissertation must be an original work, either in or definitely ralated to the student's major area of specialization. II proper standards or quality, objectivity, originality, and independence are maintained, the candidate may use data which he/she has derived from his/her University research. Neither the results of the research nor the publication of findings can be restricted by any non-university agency nor can they be published prior to acceptance by the Graduate Schcol, unless prior approval of such publication has been secured from both the adviser and the Graduate School. Advisers have primary responsibility for apPfOval of the essay or thesis, but every member of a doctoral committee must read, approve and sign the dissertation. A student may not begin work on a manusaipt until he/she has submitted an approved Plan of Work and outline form. He/she may then register for the thesis or dissertatton and pay regular fees in the same manner as for all other course work.

The Study of Law at Wayne State University History and Goals of the Law School Wayne State University Law School has been a source of lawyers for Michigan and the rest of the nation for more than sixty-five years. A group of public--,;pirited lawyers led by Judge Allan Campbell, in cooperation with the Board of Education of the City of Oelroit, established the new law school in 1927 as part of the Colleges of the City of Oelroit: The Law School and other oolleges grew and flourished and were subsequendy renamed Wayne University. In 1956, the University joined the University of Michigan and Michigan State University as one of.the State's three major public universities, and was renamed Wayne State University. Wayne State University is an institution dedicated to excellence in education and research. The focus of the Juris Ooctor (J.D.) program is preparation of lawyers for the wide variety of professional opportunities available with law firms, corporations, public interest groups, government. and many law~lated fields. The rich and varied educational program not only teaches the legal rules by which our business and personal affairs are governed in a complex society, but also instills an appieciation of the larger role of the legal profession as it shapes society's values and institutions. The program sb\"esses experienoes designed to develop the skill of written expression, and to provide oral advocacy b'aining in trial and appellate settings. In addition to the traditional classroom component, the Law School offers the opportunity to enrich legal education with raal--life legal experience. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the special opportunities available in the Detroit metropolitan area for internships with judges, prosecutors' and defenders' offices, and public interest law practices. The Law School's fac~lty is actively involved in scholarly research. Professors at Wayne State University Law School make significant contributions to the understanding of issues in environmental law, taxation, criminal procedure, constitutional law, urban law and many other fields. Their books and articles oontribute to the depth and quality of classroom teaching. It is the interaction of teaching and research which creates an especially stimulating environment for the law student. The Law School takes great pride in its diversity. The full-time faculty includes individuals experienced in local, state and federal government, others who have served as judicial clerks for federal judges, a number with backgrounds in private practice, and others who are well known public interest advocates. They combine excellent academic credentials with practical experience. The faaJlty is committed to classroom teaching excellence and to advancing the state of professional knowledge through scholarship. The Law School is fortunate to_ be able to recruit excellent part-time faculty from the Detroit metropolitan area. Respected judges and practitioners bring valuable and specialized professional perspectives to the adjunct faculty. Accreditation Wayne State University Law School is accredited by both of the major national accrediting agencies for legal education: the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools. National Recognition The Law School has a Chapter of the Order of the Coif, the national honorary society dedicated to the highest standards of legal scholarship. Only about one-third of the law schools in the United States have been selected for Cott chapters. Membership is limited to the top ten percent of each graduating ctess, elected by the faculty. In establishing its Chapter of Order of the Coif, Wayne State University Law School has joined other law schools in promoting exceptional accomplishment in legal studies. Law School Faculty and Student Profile The Law School is comprised of a teaching faculty of thirty-eight full-time and thirty-four part-time faculty members. Student enrollment is approximately 750, 45. 7 percent of which are women and 14.6 percent of which are persons of oolor. The median LSAT soore of enrolled students is 156, and their median honor point average is 3.25. Law School Setting Wayne State University is located in the hean of the University/Cultural Center area about four miles from downtown Detroit. Within a few blocks of the Law School are the Detroit Public Library, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the International Institute, the Detroit Historical Museum, the Detroit Science Center, and the Museum of Ahican American History. South of the main campus is the Detroit Medical Center and the Wayne State University Medical School. State and federal courts and offices are concentrated in the downtown area. The Law School is located on the main campus adjacent to the Ferry and Gulleii Malls, convenient to the major University library complex and the University's Hilberry Theatre, which houses one of the most distinguished graduate theatre repenory companies in the United States. The Law School complex includes the classroom building, the Law Librery, and the annex building. The classroom building has five aucitoriums with terraced seating designed to enhance the educational experience. There is also a lounge area for informal conversation between classes. Arthur Neef Law Library Wayne State University's Law Library is the second largest in Michigan, and twenty-third largest in the United States. It is a major resource for faculty and students of the Law School, and for members of the local and state bar, representatives of state and -ral agencies, and alumni. A modem computer laboratory provides the setting for training of students in computerized legal research. A complete desaiption of the library, its facilities and collections, may be found on page 56. Law Degrees The Law School offers academic programs leading to the degrees of Juris Ooctor (J.D.) and Master of Laws (LL.M.). The J.D. is a graduate degree requiring a baccalaureate degree as a prerequisite. The LL.M. is a graduate degree offered by the Law School in the fields of taxation, labor law, and corporate and finance law which requires as prerequisite the J.D. or its equivalent. JURIS DOCTOR MASTER OF LAWS MASTER OF LAWS in Corporale and Finance Law MASTEROFLAWS inLaborlaw MASTER OF LAWS inTaxation u,wSclwol 185 JURIS DOCTOR (J.D.) PROGRAM First Year Day Program The first-year day program is a full-time rMH!emester program which begins only in the fall. Students must take all required first-year courses. The fall term curriculum consists of Contracts, Civil Procedure, Property, Torts, and Legal Writing and Research, for a total of fourteen credits. In the winter term, students complete the second half of these courses as well as Criminal Law for a total of sixteen credits. Students in the day program are strongly discouraged from employment of any type during the first year. Evening Program The Law School offers a part-time program which enables students to complete their J.D. requirements in four to six years. The first-year evening curriculum is mandatory and consists of two semesters of Civil Procedure, Contracts, and Legal Writing and Research. In the second year of the evening program, students take Property, Torts, Criminal Law, and Constitutional Law I, and may choose additional electives. Most evening classes are held from 6:1 Oto 8:10 p.m., Monday through Thursday. To provide a wider selection for evening students, several classes are also offered from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Class size is generally smaller in evening oourses than in day classes. Combined Day/Evening Program The combined day/evening program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to complete law school in three years, but who prefer to take as many classes as possible in the evening. The program may be elected by any applicant. In the combined day/evening program, first-year students must take Civil Procedure, Contracts, and Legal Writing and Research in the evening, and Property or Torts during the day. (Students who wish may take both Property and Tor1s during the day of the first year.) Criminal Law will be taken in the evening of the second semester of the second year. Students in the combined program who complete all five courses open to them will have twenty...,,.,ven credits at the end of their first yaar, only three credits short of the thirty credits completed by full-time day students. These three a-edits can be readily made up dJring the summer or in subsequent academic years, allowing students in the combined day/evening program to complete the degree in three years if they so choose. Legal Writing and Research The Law School is noted for its excellent legal writing and research program, which is conducted by five full-time lecturers,- one of whom serves as director of the program. The textbook and related materials, developed by current and former instructors at the Law School, are used bY many other law schools around the country. A major part of the first-year curriculum is Legal Writing and Researdl, taught in small seetions. The two-semester course begins with a non-graded orientation program. Following orientattOn, students meet with their instructors in weekly class sessions and in frequent individual conferences. In the fall term, class time is primarily devoted to the development of writing, organization, and case analysis skills. Students learn to use library materials by researching a legal problem in small groups. In the winter term, instructors teach oral and written appellate advocacy skills. Students draft an appellate brief relying on a comprehensive trial court record, and deliver an appellate oral argument before a three-judge panel of practicing attorneys. 186 Law Sclwol Upperclass Program After completing the required first-year day or combined day/evening curriculum, or the first-and second-year evening amiculum, students may chOOBe among an extensive listing of elective courses and seminats, including interdisciplinary courses covering a broad range of subjects. Students may elect courses in the day or evening or a combination of day and evening courses. It is not uncommon for evening students to elect day classes, and for day students to elect evening classes. Upperclass students may change from one program to the other as their schedules require, and may elect courses in the eight-week summer term to accelerate or to accommodate individual needs. Degree Requirements The requirements for the Juris Doctor degree are: 1 .. A bachelor's or equivalent degree upon admission. 2. Completion of a minimum of eighty-six semester credits, with an overall honor point average of 2.0 ('C') or better for all credits completed. 3. Completion (with a final grade of at least 'D') of each of the following courses: Contracts, Property, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, Tor1s, Constitutional law I, and Professional Responsibility. Additionally, Legal Research and Writing must be completed with a final grade of at least a Low Pass. 4. Three years in residence must be completed. Students ear:n years in residence at the rate of .05 residence years for each semester credit completed.

S. The final year of study must be completed in residence at the Wayne State University Law School. 6. Students who enter as full-lime students must complete the degree requirements within five years of the date they enter.

Academic Regulations The faculty of the Law School has adopted academic regulations which cover degree requirements, examinations, and other academic matters. Compliance with the regulations is required of all law students. The academic regulations are available in the Law School Records Office. SPECIAL CURRICULAR PROGRAMS Internships Upperclass students have the opportunity to earn academic credit while interning on a part-time basis for distinguished judges or a variety of governmental and no~fit agencies in the Detroit area. With the consent of both the dean and the facully, students may also arrange for special public interest internships outsk:ie the Detroit metropolitan area. The internship program provktes a unique opportunity for students to gain practical experience while concurrently pursuing their classroom studtes. Intellectual Property Law Institute (IPLI) The I LPI was created in 1987 by the State Baro! Michigan and the law faculties of Wayne State University, the University of Detroit Mercy, and the Universily of Windsor, Ontario. The IPLI offers an exceptional, rich curria.llum for law students and lawyers, comprised of courses and seminars in intellectual property law in patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, computer and related technology, communications and media, entertainment, tec:hnok>gy transfer, and trade regulation and the ar1s. Law students who enroll in IPLI courses pay tuition to their home institution, and credit for courses taken at other institutions is bansferred to the home institution. International Programs The Law School offers manycoursesintheareaof international law. It also sponsors several international study and exchange programs: The Freeman Fellowship, for study at the Hague \u00b7Academy of International Law (Netherlands); Wayne State University-Utrecht (Netherlands) law faculty and student exchange program; and the Wayne State University Law School-University of WalWick (England) Law School student exchange program. Center for Legal Studies The newly-inaugurated Center for Legal Studies seeks to foster the development of a community of scholars in several disciplines who are devoted to interdisciplinary legal scholarship, and to provide opportunities for u\"\"8rgraduate, graduate, and Law School students to engage in the interdisciplinaiy study of law and law-related subjects. COMBINED LAW AND GRADUATE STUDIES Law School students may pursue a mastefs degree in a field other than law concurrendy with their legal education. Upon completion of their first year of law stuctf, students may apply to the Law School for permission to take a combined degree program and to the appropriate school or college of the University for admission as a master's candidate. If admitted, students may divide their time between the Law School and the concurrent program of study, devoting sufficient time to each to meet the academic and ~idence requirements of both schools. This program will require a minimum of four years of study at the University. Students who are not interested in a master's degree, but who are interested in taking graduate level courses related to their legal training in other schools and colleges of the University may receive credit -ard their law degree for the satisfactoiy completion of such worl<. The stuolent must first secure the approval of the Dean to register for such courses. \u00b7For detailed information on gradlate courses and programs in the University, consult the other school and college sections of this bulletin. Combined Degree Programs: The Law School offers the following Joint degree programs: J.D./M.A.,Histoiy; J.D./M.A., Political Science; and J.D./M.B.A. See the respective departmental sections in the College of Liberal Arts section, and the School of Business Administration section, of this bulletin for further details. Bar Examinations Students who contemplate practicing law in states other than Michigan should consult Bar examiners of those states at the eartiest opportunity with reference to the requirements of such states. In several states, prospective candidates are required to notify the Bar examiners at the beginning of their law study of their intention of taking the examination upon graduation. Information regarding the Michigan Bar examination can be obtained by writing to The State Bar of Michigan Committee on Character and Fitness, 306 Townsend, Lansing, Ml 48933-2083. Although the curriculum of the School is not primarily designed for preparing students to pass the various state bar examinations, substantially all of the subject matter of the examinations is covered adequately in the regular .courses. However, the objective of the School is the development of an understanding of the theoiy of the law, its application, and the techniques of practice - in other Words, to prepare a student for the practice of law. ADMISSION POLICIES and PROCEDURES Preparation for Law Study The Law School has no requirements with respect to the content of pre-legal edlcatlon, but its Admissions Committee will take into account the nature of college work completed as well as the grades achieved. Proficiency in the English language, both written and spoken, and in analytical skiHs is essential to the study of law. The suggestions for pralaw preparation in the Offic/a/ Guide II> U.S. Law Schools, published by the Law School Admission Council, are excellent This guide contains material on the legal profession and the study of law, and information on each American Bar Association (ABA) accredited law school. It \u00b7 may be ordered from the Law School Admisstorl Services, and is available in most bookstores and libraries. Prospective students are welcome to come into the Law School Admissions Office, Room 195, Law Ubraiy Annex Building, during the regular office hours, to look at the Official Guide and other law school reference materials. Admission Policy An applicant for admission to the Wayne State University Law School J. D. program must have\u00b7 a bachelor's degree fnlm a regionally accredited college or university. (Prior to registration, each admitted student must arrange for the law School to receive an official transaipt from the degre9-1lranting institution, evidencing the grant of the degree.) Each applicant must also take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and register with the law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS). It is the goal of the Law School\"s Admissions Committee to ensure that the entering class is composed of the most highly qualified applicants. The Committee believes that, initially, the educational process during law school and the legal profession are best served by an admissions prooess that results in the selection of a diverse and talented student body. . The Committee considers the following factors in reaching admissions decisions: (1) the applicant's academic achievement and potential, as shown by the LSA T score and undergradlate honor point average; (2) any special features of the applicant's academic record which may have had an impact on his or her honor point average such as the age of the undergraduate grades or any marked improvement in grades shown in the later years of college; (3) other relevant personal qualities and characteristics of significance such as culturaVethnic and educational background, work experience, leadership qualities, commitment to community service and communication skills. Applicants are urged to discuss these factors in their personal statement which is required as part of the application process. An individual writing a letter of recommendation for an applicant should address such factors also. Reconlderatlon: An applicant may request reconsideratiOO of an adverse admission decision by writing a letter to the Assistant Dean for Recrui1ment and Admissions stating the specific reasons why reconsideration is thought to be merited. The application will be then reviewed and reconsidered by the Admissions Committee. In the past, applicants who have successfully petilfon6d for rec:onsideration are those who have submitted updated infonnation such as new test scores or additional grades. LawSchool 187 Deferred Admlulon: The Law School does not defer admissions. An admittee who withdraws from the class must submit a new application and lee for the subsequent year for which he or she seaks admission. Reduced Program: The first-year day program curriculum is mandatory, but day studenls who have child care responsibilities or significant health care concerns may be permitted to take a slighdy reduced course load. The applicant must submit a written request prior to registration to the Assistant Dean for Reauitment and Admissions salting forth the personal circumstances justifying the request for admission as a reduced-load student. Visit to the Law School: Prospective applicanls are encouraged to visit and tour the Law School and Uni\\18rsltY campus, attend a first-year class, participate in informal discussions with studenls about law school, and consult with a member of the Admissions Office staff about admission policies, procedures and other concerns. Application Procedure There is a great deal of competition for the entering class of tt:'le Law School. The Law School received more than 1,400 applications for the 1994-95 academic year, and fewer than one-third of the applicanls were offered admission. The mecian undergreduate honor point average of the 1994--95 entering class was 3.25 and the median LSA T score was 156. Applicants for admission to the first-year class are admitted to the fall term only. Application tnatructlona for Admlaalon to the Flrst-Yur Clau: Applications for admission are accepted October 1 through March 15. Applicanls are encouraged to apply eariy, as the Law School has a rolling admissions process. The applicant's file will be ready for consideration when the Admissions Office has received the folk>wing: (1) The Law School Application for Admission signed and dated by the applicant, with all required inforination on the application and the attached cards. (2) The non-<efundable application fee, submitted with the application, of $20 for U.S. citizens or permanent residenls, and $30 for non-U.S. citizens.

Applicanls should not sand cash. (3) A brief personal statement designed to call the attention of the Admissions Committee to any experiences, interests, unusual circumstances, or any other information which the applicant believes would help the Committee evaluate his or her potential for success at the Law School.

(4) The LSDAS Report, sant by LSDAS, which will include the applicant's LSAT score(s), copies of transcripls from all of the U.S. undergraduate schools the applicant has attended, and an analysis and summary of the transcripls.

Only one letter of recommendation is required, but the Admissions Office will review up to two letters. Admissions Decisions: Applicanls with high index scores are administratively admitted and applicanls with \\18ry low scores may be administratively denied admission. AppltCants who are neither administratively admitted nor denied are placed in the discretionary pool. The Admissions Committee reviews applications from the discretionary pool and decides whether to admit, deny or wait list. Although a roUing admissions process is generally employed, discretionary admit decisions are the most difficult and usually are made later in the admission year. The Admissions Committee is composed of Law School faculty members assisted by administrative staff. The administrative staff provides infonnation, recommendations and other assistance to the faculty members who vote on the individual applications.

O'Neale Foreword The College of Liberal Aris offers eighteen master's and eight doctoral degrees in the humanities and the soctal sciences. These programs are rigorous and yet flexible enough for studen1s to pursue a variety of interdisciplinary slUdies. FaaJlty are selected for their excellenoe in teaching and research. More than two hundred faculty members are approved by the Graduate School for graduate level instruction. Graduate studen1s in the College have ample opportunity for personal contact with faculty and are encouraged to conduct research with them. The College is committed to the civersity of studen1s and faculty, so that learning in any degree program becomes a humanistic and social experience.

For further infonnation on these requiremen1s, see page 17. Preference is given to those s1Uden1s who have achievad superior undergraduate scholastic records and who evidence superior abilities. All prerequisite credi1s must be earned prior to or concurrent with the first graduate cre<fi1s. If undergraduate preparation for the major field is considered deficient, additional wol1< may be required at the undergraduate level. Many programs have adcitional individual admission requirements. Students should consult the subsequent departmental sections in this bulletin for specific requirements in each field of study. Graduate Record Examinations The Graduate Record Examination (GAE) is used to assist advisers in evaluating educational preparation and to serve as a basis for planning future slUdy. There is no uniform policy conoeming GREs; some departments require GAE scores from all app!can1s for admission, while others require scores only from students in specified classifications. SIUdents should consult the department in which they wish to major to determine which examinations must be taken. SIUdents requirad to take these examinations must apply at the Testing and Evaluation Office, 698 Student Center, either prior to or at the time of admission. Students who prevk>usly have taken the examination may have transaipts of these scores submitted. After the initial registration, no subsequent enrollment will be permitted nor will candidacy be authorized until examination requirements have been fulfilled. 'AGRADE' - Accelerated Graduate Enrollment The College of Liberal Arts has establishad an acoeleratad combined undergraduate and graduate program ('AGRADE') whereby qualified seniors in the College of Liberal Arts may enroll simultaneously in some undergraduate and graduate programs ol the College. A maximum of fifteen credits may be appliad towards both undergraduate and graduate degrees in a slUdent's major field if the major department is an 'AGRADE\" participant (Studen1s should contact the chairperson of their major department to ascertain its 'AGRADE' stalUS.) Those who elect the 'AGRADE' program may expect to complete the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in five years of lull-time slUdy. Blglbfllty: 'AGRADE' applcants must have an overall h.p.a. which places them in the top twentieth percentile of the senior class ( Cum Laude). Applican1s are also expected to have performed at a superior level in their major, as determined by the major department and reflected in an h.p.a in the major of at least 3.6 at the time of application. Appllcatlon: A slUdent seeking 'AGRADE' stalUS should present to the Graduate Admissions Committee of his/her major department all of the materials which that department requires for normal admission, EXCEPT for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) requirad by some departments. For departments in which the GRE is required, it is expected that this examination will be taken at the normal time and scores forwarded to the major department. Specific departmental admission requirements can be found in the University Graduate Bulletin or in the Graduate Office of the College of Liberal Arts (577-2690). ' ' 1,11 II II ,ii, The earliest date by which a student may apply for the 'AGRADE' program is during the semester in which he/she completes ninety credits toward the undergraduate degree. 'AGRADE Credito': Srudents may elect a minimum of three and a maximum of fifteen 'AGRADE' credits. These wHI be used to complete the baccalaureate degree as well as to SOMI as the beginning of graduate study. Upon lonnal admission to a rnastef's program, 'AGRADE\" credits are transferred as ff they were graduale credits transferred from a graduate program at another uniwrsity. The remaining graduate credits required for the master's degree wilt be eamed in the conventional manner following formal admission to the graduate program. For more details about the 'AGRADE\" program, contact the chairperson of the department in which 'AGRADE' enroNment is sought, or the Graduate Office of the College of Liberal Arts (Sn-2690). DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Graduate degrees are conferred not merely upon the completion of a prescribed number of courses nor necessarily after a given period of residence, but rather in recognition of each candidate's outstanding ability and high attainments as evidenced in all course wOl'k, research, scholarly writing, examinations and personal fitness for a chosen profession. All course wOl'k must be completed in accordance with the academic procedures of the Graduate School (see pages 23--;34) and College of Liberal Arts regulations. In addition to the general Graduate School requirements for degrees and to the information provided below, other requirements are specified by the individual graduate departments. Students should consult the programs and requirements of the departments in which they plan to major. Candidacy Candidacy is an advanced starus recommended by student advisers and authorized by the Graduate School or Liberal Arts Graduale Office upon evidence of superior scholarship, appropriate personal qualities and promise of professional competence. Srudents should nole that admission as an applicant does not assure acceptance as a candidate for a degree, and that candidacy is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for graduation. To be eligible for candidacy, srudents must file officially approved Plans of Worl<. The Plan should provide for effective concentration in a major field, with proper supporting courses in related fields. Ph.D. applicants shoud Ille their Plan with the Graduate School; master's applicants with the gradUale officer of the College of Liberal Arts. In preparing a Plan srudents. should evaluale with care their personal and professional objectives as well as all degree and departmental requirements. Normally, a srudent enrolled in a master's degree program is expecled to file a Plan of Worl< by the time twelve graduale credits or their equivalent have been earned. Applicants for candidacy should petition their adviser to advance their rank to 'cancfldate.' In most departments candidacy must be authorized by the time twelve graduate credits have been earned or subsequent registration is denied. It is recommended that an approved Plan be filed by applicants for the Ph.D. degree when approximately forty credits beyond the baccafaureale degree have been eamed. In adation lo filing the Plan, srudents must have satisfied foreign language requirements and must havr, passed the Final Qualifying Examination (written and oral) and must havr, submitted and received the Graduate Dean's approval on the Dissertation OuUine before the doctoral committee will recommend candidacy.

Final Qualifying Examination for Candidacy The final qualifying examination is required of all applicants. Applicants may request their doctoral commi- to authorize the final qualilying examination after an approved Plan of Worl< has been filed with the Graduate School. The examination will consist of both writlen and oral portions. When this examination has been passed. and when the Dean of the Graduate School has approved the Dissertation Qu1fine, applicants will be advanced to the starus of 'doctoral candidate.' The written qualilying examination will cover applicant's major and minor areas and may include such other related matters as the doctoral examining commi- may prescribe. Within thirty days after the written examination has been passed, the oral qualifying examination will be conducted by the doctoral examining oommittee in the presence of the chairperson of the departmental committee on doctoral study or his/her designee and a graduale examiner approved by the Graduale School.

Grossman, Julie Hunsaker, Panagiotis Mavros, Gawon Yoon Graduate Degrees MASTER OF ARTS with a major in Economics DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Economics (Also see MASTER OF URBAN PLANNING with specializaJion in economics, under Urban Planning, page 426; and Master of Arts in Industrial Relations, under Industrial Relations, page430) Economists should have broad intellectual interests as well as technical expertise. Though most economics graduate students have undergraduate degrees in economics, the Department encourages those with degrees in other social sciences as well as engineering and mathematics. Accordingly, the Department Sets minimal course prerequisites for its graduate programs. The M.A. in Eoonomics is frequently a terminal degree leading to careers in business, public service, or junior college teadiing. Because many master's students study part-time, the Department schedules the core courses in the evening. The M.A. Program in Industrial Relations (M.A.I.R.) is also oriented toward students with full-time jobs. Sponsored jointly by the Departments of Economics, Psychology, and Management, the program prepares students for careers in industrial relations, focusing on the structure and process of collective bargaining. M.A.I.R. is desaibedon page 430. The Ph.D. curriculum provides thorough training for professional economists through course work, tutorials and research workshops. It gives students a solid foundation in economtc theory and econometrics and offers a wide choioe of specializations. Because the program is rigorous and adheres to sbict timetables, it is not advisab'8 to combine doctoral study with full-time employment. About two-thirds of the Department's Ph.D. graduates hold academic positions; one-third choose careers in business, research organizations or government. Master of Arts With a Major in Economics Director: Kevin 0. Cotter Admloalon to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17.

(1) LIBRARY and INFORMATION SCIENCE PROGRAM DEAN: Patricia Senn Breivik FOREWORD History The Library and lnfonnation Science Program at Wayne State University traces its origins to 1918, at which time courses in school librarianship were offered to elementary teachers in the Detroit Public Schools by the Detroit Normal Training School. When the Training School later became the Detroit Teachers College, the library program was expanded. In the 1930s, a bachelo(s degree with a minor in library science was offered, designed for the preparation of elementary and secondary school librarians. Subsequently, the Detroit Teachers College united with several other institutions to become the University\"& College of Education and courses in library science were offered through that unit. By 1940, a maste(s degree program (Master of Education) had been implemented for library science majors. In 1956, Wayne University became Wayne State University; the Department of Library Science expanded its program to provide graduate education for a wide range of library specializations, and a Master of Science degree program in Library Science (M.S.L.S.) was established. Through the 1960s and 1970s, the Department of Library Science broadened and diversified its program to include not only undergraduate and graduate courses, but also a series of continuing education programs. The Department became the Library Science Program, and the Specialist Certificate in librarianship was created to serve those practicing librarians who wished to update their knowledge and professional skills. In fall 1993 the Library Science Program became the Library and Information Science Program, recognizing inaeased emphasis in the curriculum on information studies. The degree awarded is the Master of Library and Information Science (M.L.I.S.). The Library and Information Science Program also offers a certificate program in archival administration, in conjunction with the History Department of the College of Liberal Arts. Sinca 1984. the Library and Information Science Program has been under the administrative jurisdiction of the Dean of University Libraries and Library and Information Science, with degrees granted by the Graduate School of the University. The Information Profession The fiekt of library and information service is experiencing dramatic growth and change, and, for those entering the information field, the future holds challenging prospects. Today approximately 100,000 libraries in the United States employ 140,000 professionals. Additionally, some individuals use library and research skills in allied areas of information service outside the traditional library setting. In the 1990s, those with appropriate credentials will have a significandy wider choice of opportunities to apply their skills, within traditional and non-traditional libraries and information centers including business, law, medicine, publishing, government. archives and museums, communteations and media, engineering and academic environments. Most important among such credentials is the Master of Library and Information Science (M.L.I.S.) degree, internationally recognized as the first professional degree in the field and accredited by the American Library Association (ALA). The Library and Information Science Program at Wayne State University offers a quality graduate curriculum that prepares students for professional positions in a variety of traditional and non-tracitional settings in the United States and abroad. 256 Library and Information Science Accreditation The Library and Information Science Program first received accreditation for its maste(s degree by the American Library Association in 1967; the M.L.I.S. program's most recent accraditation was granted by the Committee on Accreditation of the ALA in 1996. Goals and Objectives The mission of the Library and Information Sctenc::e Program is to educate qualified men and women to assume professional responsibi~ttes as librarians/information specialists in an ever-changing society. The goals of the Library and Information Science Program are: a. To provide students with an educational program based on a philosophical and conceptual framework that will furnish a basic level of skill required to meet the information needs of modem society; b. To educate students to become library and information professionals prepared to assume positions of service and leadership in the field; c. To provide lifelong learning experiences and continuing education opportunities for library and information management professionals; and d. To engage in research and assume leadership in professional activities and organizations. To achieve these goals, the Program sets the following general objectives for its students: 1. To evaluate the library and information profession in its historical, social, economic, technological, educational, and political dimensions; 2. To identify the library's distinctive role among the communication agencies which share responsibility for the preservation and dissemination of the human record; 3. To identify the common properties of information that exist throughout disciplines as they relate to library and information service; 4. To identify and examine the concepts, structure, and organization of knowledge; 5. To select, acquire, organize, store, retrieve, analyze, and disseminate information and materials; 6. To apply the concept of information transfer to facilitate access to recorded knowledge; 7. To demonstrate an understanding of the distinctiveness of each library/infonnation center as a component of a specific environment; 8. To develop sensitivity to the opportunity and responsibility of library/information service in an urban, multicultural setting; 9. To identify the needs of individuals and groups for library/information services, design plans, and implement programs that respond to identified needs; 10. To identify, evaluate and utilize current and emerging technologies in the organization and retrieval of information; 11. To apply principles of effective management to the operation of library/information centers and systems; 12. To examine, assess, and apply research in professional practice and to the solution of library~nformation problems; 13. To aniailate a personal philosophy of ethics and professional responsibilities; 14. To recognize the necessity for continuing involvement in professional education, in professional o,ganizations, and in self-evaluation. Facilities Unl-lty Llbrarleo: Wayne State University has five libraries with a total of almost three million books and twenty-four thousand airrent subscriptions to periodicals.

Julie Thompron Klein, Richard Raspa Associate Professors Mary Lee Field, Mary Jerome Reidc, Marsha Richmond Adjunct Professor Guerin Montilus Professor Emeritus Martin Glaberman The Division of Degree Programsllnl8rdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) offers the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Bachelor of Technical and lnlerdisciplinary Studies, the Service Agency Administration undergraduate minor and post-baccaJaureate oertificate programs, and lhe Master of lnl8rdisciplinary Studies. These degree programs and courses of study are interdiscipUnary in nature and designed for worf<ing adult students. Master of Interdisciplinary Studies The Masler of Interdisciplinary Studies (MIS) degree is an inl8rdisciplinary graduete degree modeled on the tradition of graduete liberal studies programs for aduh students. Unlike specialized graduate courses of studY, lhe MIS program emphasizes interdiscipNnary approaches to significant questions, themes and problems. It develops problem-solving skills and cultivaleS critical and holistic approaches. The MIS is designed to meet the need, expressed by both educators . and employers, for individuals who can adapt flexibly to new workplace situations and who are comfortable learning new lechniques and methods. In addition, the degree affords an opportunity for intellectual enrichment. I twill appeal to four groups of students: those holding the BIS, BIS-Capstone, and BTIS degrees from lhe lnl8rdisciplinary Stucies Program; those who wish to design lheir own advanced degree program (in consultation with a faculty adviser); Nberal ar1s students who seek advanced studY beyond the bachelofs degree without specializing in one particular discipline; and those seeking a broadly in18grative program in historical and cultural studies. College of Lifelong Learnillg 267 In a world ever more given to analysis and expertise, the MIS program teaches skills fundamental to an integratiw habit of mind. We stress seeing problems from a number of angles and perspeeti\"8S, uniting these views into a coherent understan<ing shaped by both clear standards of <isciplinary depth and a firm grasp of interdisciplinary process. The student is trained to see connections, to explore and to connect relevant facelS of a theme, problem, or area of interest. The student also learns the various approaches, theories, and world views that seek to organize reality in an intercisciplinary manner. Admloolon to the MIS program is open to holders of the bachelor's degree with majors in tradilional academic disciplines as well as graduates of interdisciplinary programs. Admission is contingent upon meeting the requiremenlS for admission to the Graduate School; for requiremenlS, see pege 17.

The School offers educational programs leading to the following degrees: Doctor of Medicine, Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Science and Master of Aris. Graduate education in dinical fields, post--doc:toral study and continuing medical education programs are also offered within lhe School. Two hundred fifty-six studenls are admitted annually to the M.D. program and approximately three hundred sixty studenls are enrolled in Ph.D. or Master's degree study in fourteen program areas, predominantly in the basic medteal sciences. More than eight hundred studenls are post-11raduate trainees as medical residents, post~ral fellows, or fellows in twenty-four different clinical research programs. Continuing education programs, seminars and colloquiums serve the faculty and studenls of the School as well as professionals throughout the community as a resource for current and ongoing developments in the health sciences. In addition to degree programs, the School offers courses in many basic medical science disciplines which are appropriate for students in other colleges and schools of the University. Non-degree enrollment in basic science courses at the graduate level is permitted on a limited basis for qualified students. Research focusing on human health is the foundation of the activities in the School of Medicine. Fundamental and applied research in biomedical sciences, clinical specialities, and heath care systems is directed by faculty of the School. Research programs atthe School are supported by more than fifty million dollars annually through research granls, contracls and gills. Members of the faculty serve on scientific boards, panels, study groups and in professional leadership roles in health care regionally, nationally and internationally. The research facilities of lhe School are modem, welH>quipped and continually growing with the pace of cur,ent technological advances. The clinical services provided by the faculty, post-graduates and studenls in lhe School are rendered predominanUy through The Detroit Medical Center institutions. The School, through the University, has entered into partnership with The Detroit Medical Center hospitals. The chairpersons of our departments or their designees serve as heads of departments or divisions within each of the Medical Center hospitals. The School also perceives a responsibility to the population of the Detroit metropolitan region as a whole, both as an educational institution and as a supplier of physicians who are highly skilled providers of health care to staff other instib.ltions and to practice in the community. Furd'lermore, the School is committed to Its educational and care delivery activities within the context of medical education as a national activity, to which each institution contributes responsibly according to its abilities and resources. History of the School The School of Medicine of Wayne State University has been operating and granting degrees as a college of medicine since 1868. Originally called The Detroit Medical College, it was founded by Dr. Theodore A. McGraw, a native of Detroit who returned to the city in 1865 after serving for two years in the United States Army as a contract surgeon. In 1879 a second medical college, the Michigan College of Medicine, opened in Detroit. The two colleges soon united to become lhe Detroil College of Medicine. In 1919, the Detroit College of Medicine and Surgery, as ~ was known then, became an official part of the Detro ii Board of Education and thus an important unit in the rapidly developing Colleges of the City Qf Detroit. In 1933, lhe name of the Colleges of the City of Detroit changed to Wayne University in honor of the American Revolutionary War hero General Anthony Wayne. Wayne University became a Stale institution in 1956. The School of Medicine entered ils second century with a period of unparalleled growth and the creation of a totally new campus in The Detroit Medical Center. With the opening of the Gordon H. Srott HaH of Basic Medical Sciences in 1971, the size of the entering class increased to 256 students, making lhe Wayne State University School of Medicine the largest single campus medical school in the country.

Bollinger, Ph.D. The Division of Continuing Medical Education was established to provide direction and support for the program. The program is concerned with addressing the continuing medical educatton needs of more than half of Michigan's physicians residing in the tri-<X>unty area of metropolitan Detroit, as well as the needs of the other physicians in the state. The Division also works in close cooperation with the State's other schools of medicine and of osteopathy for the provision of educational opportunities for practicing physicians. Various conferences, symposia and workshops, lasting one to five days, are offered under the acadernic sponsorship of the departments in the Medical School. Physicians from Michigan and many other states and countries attend meetings which reflect new discoveries and changes in needs and interests in medc::ine. Every effort is made to assist phystcians in their continuing efforts to increase their knowledge and to improve their skills on behalt of the patients they serve. In addition to these one-day to week-long programs, offerings of one or several hours\u00b7 duration are also available. Physicians are encouraged to participate in the various departmental workshops, teaching rounds and grand rounds that meet their interests or needs; they are conducted in the clinical settings of the Detroit Medtcal Center hospitals ---Children's, Detroit Receiving, Harper, Grace, Huron Valley, Hutzel, and the Rehabilitation Institute. There are inaeasing pressures on practicing physicians to maintain and update their professional knowledge and skills. Wayne State University Schoot of Medicine is striving to respond _to these needs through continuing medical education. Inquiries may be directed to the Division for information about programs on specific subjects or programs for specific medical specialties. Accreditation Wayne State University School of Medicine is accradited by the Accreditation Council of Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to sponsor continuing medical education (CME) for physicians. As an accredited sponsor of CME, the School designates certain of its continuing medical education offerings as meeting the aiteria for Category 1 of the Physician's Recognition Award of the American Medical Association, and for the requirements for license renewal by the Michigan Medical Practica Board.

Orientation programs, teaching conferences and seminars, bedside teaching, and a wide variety of supervised surgical and technical b'aining are a systematic part of the graduate medtcal education of the physicians in the various specialty programs. Enrollees in the program must be eligible to register as students in Wayne State University and must have an M.O. degree or equivalent, temporary or permanent licensure to practice medicine in Michigan, and approval of the appropriate program director. Appointments on an annual basis to appropriate levels within the Graduate Medical Education Program establish the basis for a stipend which is paid to the physician as a means of personal support while enrolled in training. School of Medicine 281 GRADUATE PROGRAMS Academic Regulations Governing Master's and Doctoral Degrees Associate Dean tor Research and Graduate Programs: George E. Dambach, Ph.D. Advanced study programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees are available in the School of Medicine. The primary purpose is to provide an opportunity for graduate training in preparation for careers in research in the medical and health-related sciences. The graduate student enters a community of scholars and is expected to become acquainted with the development of a main area of study and its relationship to other pursuits. Students are expected to become independent and sett-directed, to acquire useful perspectives on the meaning and limitatK>ns of exact science, and to maintain a balance between practicality and abstract intellectual activity. They are expected to draw from and add to the wealth of accumulated knowledge in their chosen discipline. Graduate students work closely with faculty advisers Who help plan course schedules and research programs and supervise laboratory training. Admission Admission to these graduate programs is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School: for requirements, see page 17. Requests for program infonmation and application materials should be m-directly to the program of interest. Mailing address and incividuals to contact are cited below. Application: Applicants must submit: (i) University Graduate School application fonm: (ii) official transcripts of all undergraduate (and applicable graduate) academic work: (iii) Graduate Record Examination scores, verbal, cp..1antitative and analytical components. Most study programs are planned for students who begin in the fall semester; however. matria.llation may be possible at other times . during the year in individual eases. Students for whom English is not their native language will be required to submit TOEFL examination scores and to demonstrate competency, both verbal and written, in English within 1he first year of study. The recommended procedure for appUcation is: 1. Contact 1he Graduate Officer of the department for information and forms; 2. Submit ALL al)plication materials by March 1 for admission to begin study in the fall semester; 3. Earlier applications will be accepted in most cases. Late applications will be evaluated; however, the graduate programs have limited enrollment, and thus late applicants may encounter programs already filled. Most financial aid oompetition is promulgated in the months of March and April: late applicants may have very limited opportunities for financial assistance. The following Graduate Officers may be oontacted through 1he School of Medicine, Wayne State University, 540 E. Canfield Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48201; (telephone: 313-o77-1455; the graduate programs o(lered by the School of Medicine pay the regular graduate teas of the University; see page 20. Master of Science Descriptions of individual programs may be found in the departmental sections which follow. Two interdisciplinary programs are offered in addition to the discipline-based courses of study: a masters degree program in basic medical sctences and a master's degree program in medical research. These are described below under Interdisciplinary Degree Programs, beginning on page 283. General requirements for 1he Master cit Science degree may be found on pege 30. Doctor of Philosophy Programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1he basic medical sciences are under 1he jurisdiction of 1he Graduate School of the University. Majors within the School of Medicine are available in 1he following academic areas: anatomy and cell biology, biochemistry, cancer biology, cellular and clinical neurobiology, immunology and microbiology, medical physics, molecular biology and genetics, pathology, phanmacology, and physiology. Brief program descriptions are provided under each department heading in the following pages, as are listings of graduate coursas offered by the School of Medicine. The program in medical physics is described in the Radiation Oncology Departmental section of this bulletin. Programs in cancer biology, cellular and clinical neurobiology, and molecular biology and genetics are described below under Interdisciplinary Degree Programs, beginning on page 283. General requirements for 1he Doctor of Philosophy degree may be found beginning on pege 31. Combined Doctor of Medicine-\u00ad Doctor of Philosophy Degrees A oombined M.D. and Ph.D. program of study may be designed to provide an opportunity for exceptionally talented students to acquire knowledge and expertise in both research and clinical medicine. By combining and interrelating the Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy programs, the dual degree objectives may be accomplished effectively and often in a shorter time than is possible by two separate degree programs oompleted in sequence. Such a program will prepare the student to assume investigative leadership in medical schools and in institutes for medical research. Our program is flexible so that it can be adapted to bast suit 1he student's discipline, needs and objectives. Admloalon: A student who has an excellent academic record may be considered for the combined degree program when he/she has been admitted by separate and independent processes to the M.0. program and one of the Ph.D. programs in 1he School of Medicine. Students must pursue admission to the two programs separa~y. There is NO combined admission process. Applications are usually not made at 1he same time; students often apply to the Ph.D. program after admission to the M.D. program - for example, during the first or second year of their M.D. study. Students interested in a combined degree program may contact the Graduate Programs Office in the School for further information and counseling. -Degree Requirements The requirements for the combined M.D.-Ph.D. degrees confonn with those established for the separate degrees by the School of Medicine, the Graduate School, and the individual departments involved. Financial Support for Graduate Study Graduate assistantships, fellowships and ruition scholarships are available for qualified students admitted to the various graduate programs. All fonns of support are limlted in numbsr and are awarded on a competitive basis. The School endeavors to generate support for all qualified full-time doctoral students. Interdisciplinary Degree Programs The School of Medicine currently offers interdisciplinary graduate degree programs in: basic medical sciences - M.S. cancer biology - M.S., Ph.D. cellular and clinical neurobiology - Ph.D. medical research - M.S. These programs are staffed by graduate faculty of several departments and may draw on course offerings from multiple subject areas.

Upfal, Lawrence Warbassc, Ernest Yoder Graduate Degrees MASTER OF SCIENCE wilh a major in communily Ma/th services and a specialization in occupational medicine GRADUATE CERTIFICATE in communily Ma/th services research and evaluation Community medicine is the academic discipline that deals with the identification and solution of health problems of communities or human populations. It is a population-based discipline which addresses certain aspects of all purposes of medicine: health promotion, disease prevention, restoration of health, relief of suffering, and the maintenance of health - while requiring a precise definition of health problems and a specific commitment to examine them and treat them in the full scope of their implications. The range and scope of the sciences and skills required in community medicine include epidemiology, biostatistics, experimental design, research methodology, and an array of biomedical and behavioral sciences. Central to the approach of community medicine is the premise that the main factors that determine a community's health are to be found within the community itself: in its social, economic, culb.Jral, ethnic, and bimogical features; or in its environment, natural and man-made. Therefore. the charge of the Department of Community Medicine is to define selected community problems, propose studies and smutions, maintain surveillance, evaluate progress, and monitor the use of resources. There is a strong community and public health focus in the Department, and an emphasis on research and applications of socio-behavioral and medical sciences to health problems in the community. Collboration with other schools in the University allows for an interdisciplinary approach to study of the health care system. The Department also provides training for first-year and second-year medical students in epidemiologic and biometric studies, and in current health service issues relevant to mecical practice. Opportunittes exist for students who wish to concentrate on aspects of community and public tieallh during their senior elective yeer. Master of Science With a Major in Community Health Services AdmlHlon to this program is contingent upon admission to the Gradua1e School and the School of Medicine; see pages 17 and 282, respectively.

Emergency medicine provides basic life support training to freshman students and physical diagnosis instruction to a limited number of sophomore students. Junior students receive advanced cardiac life support training and participate in a surure laboratory to learn suture techniques. A mandatory rotation in emergency medicine for all senior srudents takes place at Detroit Medical Center hospitals or other affiliated hospitals. The fourth year rotation is designed to familiarize the student with: (1) the evaluation, assessment and stabilization of patients with urgent medical problems; (2) invasive and nonillvasive procedures routinely used in the emergency department; and (3) management of acutely-ill patients in a timely manner. Graduate medical education indudes three three-year emergency medicine residency programs, two based at the Detroit Medical Canter (Detroit Receiving Hospital and Grace Hospital), and one at St: John Hospital and Medical Center. There are two five-year combined residency programs: emergency medicine/pediatrics, and emergency medicinelintemal medicine. All programs are fully accredited.

Z.Oghlin Adjunct Instructors Patricia Annstrong, Gerald Terlep, Roger Wabeke Undergraduate Education The Department of Family Medicine participates in the education of medical students through several mechanisms. In the first year of medical school students are provided the following educational opportunities: 1) a 'clinical track' is offered to all of the freshman class and all of the sophomore class. These usually prEH:linical students are exposed to a variety of case simulations, physical diagnosis problems, and clinical 296 School of Medicine experiences at the University, as well as in local residency programs and physician offices. 2) The Department suppor1s student education in physical diagnosis, ethics and humanities. 3) A voluntary experience allows medical students to visit practicing family physicians. A required four-week third year clerkship/preceptorship is conducted by the Depanment. Most students are placed with private physicians or residencies in family practice located throughout the Detroit metropolitan area. Altematiw placements locate students in physician's offices in outstate Michigan, including the Upper Peninsula. This course stresses ambulatory family practice with an emphasis on skill-building based in a continuity of care experience. A number of electives are offered in the fourth year, including: additional preceptorship experiences with practicing family physicians, specially--<lesigned experiences with family practice residency programs, geriatrics, occupational health, community medicine, and research. Graduate Education The Department, in cooperation with Grace Hospital, Huron Valley Hospital, and other Detroit Medical Center institutions, sponsors a three;,ear accredited Family Practice Residency Program. Ambulatory family practice experience takes place in the Family Practice Center, located at the Huron Valley Family Practice Center in Novi, the Grace Family Practice Center in Royal Oak, Michigan, and the Grace Family Practice Center on Outer Drive near Grace Hospital in Detroit. Hospital rotations are arranged through the Detroit Medical Center Network. Residents gain experience in Children's, Harper, Hutzel, Detro~ Receiving, and the Veterans Administration hospitals. The Department has initiated a two-year program in occupational and environmental medicine training at the graduate level. A geriatric fellowship (two years) is operated joindy with the Department of lntemal Medicine. Postgraduate Educa#on: The Department plays an active role in providing continuing education for family physicians in practice. A five-day clinical update conference is presented each year in addition to weekly and monthly Departmental conferences approved for continuing medical education a-edit to which practicing physicians are invited. Community Service: In order to carry out clinical education functions, faculty and residents of the Department offer mecical care to the community through the Family Practice Centers and related institutions. Patient care functions are performed in coUaboration with other health profession_als such as clinical nurse specialists, cUnical pharmacists, and social workers and their students. These services are available to individuals and families of all socio-economic levels in the community, including students, staff and faculty of the Uniwrsity. The Department provides geriatric care at Grace Hospital and the Detroit Medical Center Nursing and Convalescent Center in northwest Detroit. A senior departmental faculty member directs the epk:lemiology section of the Karmanos Cancer Institute. Ressarch: Departmental research interests include sb.Jdies designed to improve the delrYery of primary health services at the individual, family and community level and to provide health promotion services which recogrtize the important role of .the family and community in maintaining health and coping with illness. Specific research projects focus on the cost~ffectiveness of patient education in risk factor reduction, occupational health screening in industrial WOl'kers, and ambulatory health issues. The health needs of the elderly are another major area of research interest, partic:ular1y in issues that relate to prevention of debilitating illness and cost~ffectiveness of health care. Newer research programs include cancer epidemkllogy. IMMUNOLOGY and MICROBIOLOGY Office: 7374 Scott Hall; 577-1591 Chairperson: Paul C. Montgomery Deputy Chairperson: Myron A.

Wilhebn Adjunct Instructor Gwendolyn B. MacKenzie The major objective of the educational program in internal medicine is to establish a firm conceptual basis for clinical diagnosis and treabnent of disease. The exposure to clinical disciplines is graduated throughout the student's four year curriculum. During the early mecical school years emphasis is placed on the application of knowledge gained in the basic science courses to an understanding of the biological disorders which accompany human disease. In the freshman year, the student works with the Deparbnent of Internal Medicine through participation in several clinical conferences. During the sophomore year, the student's attention is directed toward the study of pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, the principles of clinical diagnosis and the scientific basis of therapeutics. An internal medicine forum is available for students interested in internal medicine as a career. In the junior and senk>r years emphasis is placed on the student's direct participation in patient care as a member of the health-care team. In the junk>r year the student gains clinical experience through assignment to Wayne State University teaching hospitals; this insures acquaintance with several members of the faculty and to a wide spectrum of medical problems. During the senior year, the student spends a month as an acting intern and a month in an outpatient clinic to gain experience with ambulatory medicine. EJective courses in subspecialties are offered. Students may also choose to pursue laboratory investigative programs under the tutetage of members of the faculty. In addition to formal course work, the student may elect more intensive study as a student-feUow in either clinical or laboratory medicine during the summer recesses. With the expansion of the Internal Medicine faculty, a number of research experiences supported by a variety of national funding agencies are available. 300 School of Mediciu NEUROLOGY Office: 6E University Health Oiugani, Paula Dote-Duffy, Poter A.

This is accomplished by close affiliation with and participation in the neurosciences core curriculum of the freshman and sophomore years. Lectures, oonferences and ward rounds are included in this teaching program. In the third year neurology teaching program the Depenmenrs curricula emphasizes the surgical aspects of neurology. Third year students are made aware of problems best handed by neurosurgical techniques during their trauma and emergency surgery rotation. Founh year students seeking funher study of neurosurgical techniques may elect programs in clinical neurosurgery and in experimental treatment of heed injury cases. Detrott Receiving Hospital, Harper Hospital, Grace Hospital, and Children's Hospital Of Michigan are the primary clinical faciWties for undergraduate instruction by this depenment. A six;,ear residency training program in netJrosurgery is conducted by the Depanment and based at the following University-affiliated hospitals: Detroit Receiving, Harper, Grace, and Children's. The research interests of the deper1ment are concentrated primarily in the neurological mechanisms involved in, and protection against, head and spine injury, stereotactic and computer-essisted surgery, skull base surgery, anetJrysms and AVM clinical studies, and craniolacial anomalies. The Department of Neurosurgery operates the Gurdjian-lissner Biomechanics Laboratory as well as a microsurgical laboratory for residents and participants in ongoing research projects who require training in miaosurgtcal techniques and microsurgical anatomy.

Sherrod The Ophthalmology Department is committed to education, research, and health care in the Detroit Medical Center. These activities are conducted primarily in the Kresge Eye Institute under the direction of the Department Chairperson. The close association of medical practice, research and teaching makes the Kresge Eye \u00b7institute a unique teaching facility. Whether correcting common eye disorders such as cataracts, glaucoma and slrabismus, or performing highly technical operations such as vitrectomy, corneal transplants or lens implantations, the medical staff uses the most current diagnostic, treatment, and surgical methods. Thus, the lnstiMe is ideally suited for clinical instruction because it attracts many patients with rare eye diseases, engages in advanced diagnostic techniques, performs a wide range of delicate eye operations and is a center for eye research. Through its affiliation with the University and the Detroit Medical Center, the Institute provides a stimulating learning environment for graduate physicians and medical students. At this facility they have the opportunity to work with leading ophthalmologists and research scientists. Each year the lnstiMe selects six outstanding medical graduates for a three-year residency training program in eye diseases and surgery. Clinical and research fellowships in corneal disease and transplantation, vitreoretinal diseases and surgery, glaucoma and oculoplastic surgery are available on a selective basis upon completion of the residency program. The lnstitute's faculty also provides lectures and clinical training for third and fourth year medical students. The teaching encompasses courses in ophthalmology for family practice and emergency medical care. ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY Office: 1 South, Hutzel Hospital; 745-8248 Interim Chairper$on: Stephen P.

The aim of the student clerkship is to acquaint the student with the course of normal development, the common variatkms from nonnal patterns, and the reaction of the immature to illness. An effort is made to inoorporate all aspects of childhood in the allotted time of study in order to have lull participation by members of the surgical, orthopedic, and psychiatric staff. The technique of pedagogy used is built around the association of students with a principal instructor who supervises his/her group both in the patient units and the clinics. The Department of Pediatrics maintains contact with the student before the clerkship through conbibution to the curriculum of basic science courses. The Department also provides an optional program of study during the fourth year. The Fourth Year Elective Program offers the senior student an opportunity to gain experience in general pediatrics at a greater level of responsibility in patient care. The student assumes an increasing role as a prirhary caretaker under the supervision of the resident staff in advanced years of pediatric training. Experience in the pediatric subspecialties is also available to senior students. Thus, they are able to improve the level of their clinical skills and to obtain familiarity with the appUcation of clinical and laboratory research techniques to the investigation of pathophysiology in a wide variety of children. Further information regarding programs may be obtained by writing to the office of the Chairperson of the Department. PHARMACOLOGY Office: Paul F. Hollenberg, Ronald Hines, David Kessel, Bernard H.

Ragan (Radiation Oncology) Graduate Degrees MASTER OF SCIENCE with a major in Radiological Physics DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Medical Physics Undergraduate teaching in the M.D. program in this depanment is diracted toward a total integration of the fundamentals of ra<iology with the basic sctences, particularly anatomy, physiology, chemistry and pathology. Radiologic instruction is correlated at freshman and sophomore levels with other departments. Junior-level instruction is clinically oriented and numerous radiologic electives are offered in the senior year. Various diagnostic imaging techniques such as conventional ra<iographic procedures; redionuclide imaging, both static MR; and digital subtraction rediography are included in both the undergraduate and graduate level of instruction. The pre-<:linical program has been -igned to orient the anatomy student to nonnal roentgen anatomy and also to relate this to aspacts of physical diagnosis. There is further coordination in anatomy and physiology to emphasize function and in tum relate this to aspects of history taking. In the fields of physiology and physiologic chemistry, radioactive isotope techniques are presented relating particula~y to endocrine functions, renal functions and blood formation. Correlated teaching is also carried in gross pathology. In the clinical years, teaching of diagnostic radiology, radiation therapy, nuclear ra<iology, computerized tomography, MRI, and ultrasonography is releted to total patient care and such teaching is, therefore, predominantly correlated with other clinical departments. The clinical aspects of <iagnostic radiology, radiation therapy and radionuclide procedures and techniques are taught during clerkship and in the clinics and various inter-departmental and intra-departmental conferences. Graduate Degree Programo: The Depanment of Ra<iology collaborates with the Depanment of Radiation Oncology to offer courses of study leading to a Master of Scienoe degree in Radiological Physics or a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Medical Physics. Students should refer to that depanment (page 314) for program descriptions and an oudine of admission and degree requirements.

The College is committed to research and scholarly activity which contributes to the discipline of nursing and eXcels in the development application, and dissemination of such knowledge to promote human health and well-being. Nursing is an academic ciscipline and a profession. As a discipline, nursinQ develops kr,owledge concerning human beings, their care, health, and the environment Concepts derived from such research order the discipline and profession of nursing as well as give identity to nursing practice and direct inquiry and theory development. As a profession, nursing creatively uses knowledge in response to the health care needs of society. Both of thesa functions are enhanced by the scholarly environment of the University and its multicultural urban setting as a context for professional nursing practice. Consistent with this view of the nursing profession, the College supports the importance of liberal arts, humanities, and the sciences in nursing education. The faculty believes that programs designed for the preparation of nurses must be composed of the intellectual, social, cultural, and technical components of liberal and professional education that are available to students within an institution of higher learning. ThEl faculty also affirms the necessity and value of clinical practice within a professional nursing program. Experience within a variety of clinical and vulnerable populattOns is one of the primary modes for the development of nursing practtee competencies. Learners from diverse backgrounds enter the College to begin or continue their education and thereby add to the richness of this learning environment. The faculty supports the right of studenlS to question, challenge and debate within the context of inquiry as an essential ingredient to their development. Continuing evaluation on the part of the students and the faculty is essantial to advancing nursing knowledge and sustaining the integrity of the program. The faculty of the College of Nursing, as members of the academic community, recognizes that its professional functions extend beyond contributions to formal teaching. Research, practice, and community service are important expectattOns of the faculty. The faculty views as essential, academic freedom, shared governance, opportunity to develop knowledge, and responsibility to incorporate new knoWledge into teaching and nursing practice. The faculty assumes responsibility for enhancing the image of the College of Nursing and the University locally, nationally, and internationally through various avenues including research, scholarship, practice, consultation, and participatory \u00ab;fecision making. Accreditation The baccalaureate program is approved by the Michigan State Board of Nursing, and graduates are admitted to the ltcensing examination for professional nurses in the State of Michigan.

Rose Graduate Degrees MASTER OF SCIENCE with a major in Pharmacelllical Sciences and specializalions in Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmacelllics, and Pharmaco/ogyffoxicology DOCfOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Pharmacelllical Sciences and specializalions in Medicinal Chemistry, Pharmacelllics, and Pharmaco/ogyff oxico/ogy The pharmaceutical sciences encompeBB the tracitional disciplines of medicinal or pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmaceutics and pharmacology/toxicology. While an undergraduate pharmacy degree is desirable, applicants with a strong background in the behavioral, biological and/or physical sciences wiH be considered for graduate work in this department. Because of the comp6mentary nature and interrelationships among these disciplines, the emphasis is on an interdisciplinary approach, hence the Bingle major with specializadons rather than separate majors. This leads to greater flexibility in designing individualized programs geared to the applicant's preparation and interests. The specialty in medicinal chemistry is primarily concerned with the development of new compounds which may be of value in the ciagnoBis and treatment of disease. Included are applicadons of organic chemistry, natural product chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology and the relationships between chemical structure, physical properties and biological activity. Within pharmaceutics, the areas of biophannaceutics and pharmacokinetics are concerned with the kinetics of absorption, cistribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and model compounds. Physical pharmacy deals .with physical chemical principles and their application to the pharmaceutical sciences. Also of interest in pharmaceutics Js the application of biopharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics and physical pharmacy to pharmaceutical product development. Co/leg of Pharmacy and Allied Health Profusions 335 Pharmacology/toxicology deals with the principles and mechanisms of drug action on biological systems and the toxicological aspects of drugs and other substances.

Tai Graduate Degree MASTER OF SCIENCE in Occupational Therapy The Master of Science degree program in this Department is a post-professional program for certified occupational therapists. The program offers advanced education related to two major elements of ooc:upational therapy. The first is current frames of reference that guide ooc:upational therapy - for example, behavioral, biomechanical, cognitive, developmental, the model of human occupation, neurodevek>pment, psychoanalytical and rehabilitative. Other frames of reference may be added as professionally relevant. The second element is related lo the roles of occupational therapists in practice. Academic and field work experiences are available related to these roles - for example, administrator, advocate, consultant, educator, evaluator, leader, _manager, s8MC8 provider, and researcher. The program emphasizes an inclvidualized approach to students' progression through the curriculum. This approach allows students to choose from a variety of graduate course offerings as electives to focus on an area of study. The Institutes of Geronlology and Developmental Disabilities offer graduate certificate programs which can be taken concurrently with the master of science degree program. Master of Science in Occupational Therapy Students are expected to oomplete the program in one-and-one-half to two years full-time, or in three to four years part-time. Part-time study is an option for the working practitioner and is facilitated by the availability of all occupational therapy graduate courses (and many of the courses in other departments) in the late afternoon or evening; some classes are ottered on weekends. However, during the semester in which the student elects the Professional Field Experience, full-time study may be required. Admission: For admission to this program applk:a.nts must satisfy the following criteria: 1. Fulfill requirements for regular admission to the Graduate School; see page 17 (qualified admissions are only considered in exceptional cases and require a full faculty review). 352 College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Profusions I I ,,, 2.

Petersen Foreword The College of Science provides insb'Uelion and supports research over a broad specb'Um of scienlific disciplines. The program of inslruction serves the related purposes of acquainting slUdents with the methods used in the search for scientific truth and of preparing slUdents to apply scientific knowledge to the solution of practical problems. The active programs of researdi carried out in the various depar1ments fulfill the University's obligation to increase fundamental scientific knowledge and to apply scientific knowledge to the improvement of the human condition. The research endeavor enriches the educational program by assuring the professional competence of those responsible for teaching, by making certain that slUdents are taught the latest theories and techniquas, and by imbuing the teaching process with the excitement of discovery.

For further information on these requirements, see page 17. Preference is given to those slUdents who have achieved superior undergraduate scholastic reccrds and who evidence superior abWlties. All prerequisite credits must be earned prior to or concumint with the first graduate credits. If undergraduate preparation for the major field is considered deficient, additional work may be required at the undergraduate level. Many programs have additional individual admission requirements. Students should consult the subsec::,.ient departmental sections in this bulletin for specific requirements in each field ofslUdy. Graduate Record Examinations The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is used to assist advisers in evaluating educational preparation and to serve as a basis for planning future slUdy. There is no uniform policy concerning GREs; some departments require GRE scores from an applicants for admission, while others require scores only from studenls in specified classifications. SIUdenls should consult the department in which they wish to major to determine which examinations must be taken. SIUdenls required to take these examinations must apply at the Testing and Evaluation Office, 698 SIUdent Center, either prior to or at the time of admission. SIUdenls who previously have taken the examination may have transcripts of these scores submitted. Alter the initial registration, no subsequent enrollment will be permitted nor will candidacy be authorized until examination requirements have been fulfilled. 'A GRADE' -Accelerated Graduate Enrollment Several departments of the College - Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Mathematics, and Nutrition and Food Science - permit academically superior slUdents to petition for admission into the College's 'A GRAOE' program. 'A GRAOE' procedures enable qualified seniors to enroll simultaneously in the undergraduate and graduate programs of the College and apply a ma1eimum of fifteen credits towards both a badlelor's and master's degree in the major field. SIUdents eleeling 'A GRADE' programs may expect to complete the bachelor's and master's degrees in live years of lull-time slUdy. An 'A GRAOE' applicant may petition the Graduate Committee of the major department for acceptance into the program no earlier than the semester in which ninety credits are comp'8ted. Applicants must have an overall h.p.a. at the 'Cum Laude' level (approximately 3.4) and not less than a 3.6 h.p.a. in the major courses already completed. If the student's petition is aocepted, the student's faculty adviser shall develop a graduate Plan of Work, specifying the 'A GRADE' courses to be included in subsequent semesters. For more details about the 'A GRADE' program, contact the Graduate Office of the College of Science (577-2690), and the chairperson of the major department. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Graduate degrees are conferred not merely upon the completion of a prescribed number of courses nor necessarily after a given period of residence, but rather in recognition of each candidate's oulStanding ability and high attainmenlS as evidenced in all course work research scholarly writing, examinations and personal fitness for O a chose~ profession. All course work must be completed in accordance wi1h 1he academic procedures of the Graduate School (see pages 23-a4) and College of Science regulations. In adcltion to the general Graduate School requiramenlS for degrees and to 1he information provided below. o1her requiremenlS are specified by the individual graduate departments. StudenlS should consult 1he programs and requiremenlS of the departmenlS in which they plan to major. . ' Candidacy Candidacy is an advanoed stalUs recommended by slUdent advisers and au1horized \u00b7 by the Graduate School or Liberal Ar1s/Science Graduate Offica upon evidence of superior scholarship, appropriate personal qualities and promise of professional competenoe. SIUdenlS should note that admission as an appNcant does not assure acoeptence as a candidate for a degree, and 1hat canddacy is a necessary but not sufficient ~irement for gracilation. To be eligible for candidacy, slUdents must file officially approved Plans of Work. The Plan should provide for effective concantration in a major field, wi1h proper supporting courses in related fields. Ph.D. applicanlS should officer Scienoe. In preparing a Plan , slUdenlS should evaluate with care their personal and professional objectives as well as all degree and deparbnental requireffl!'nls. Nonnally, a slUdent enrolled in a master's degree program IS expected to file a Plan of Worl<by lhe time twelve graduate credits or !heir equivalent have been earned. Olherwlse, subsequent registration is denied. It is recommended lhat an approved Plan be filed by applicanls for lhe Ph.D. degree when approximately forty credits beyond the baccalaureate degree haw been earned. In addtion to filing the Plan, students must have satisfied foreign language requirements and must have passed the Final Qualifying Examina#on /written and oral/ and must have submitted and received the Graduate Dean's approval on the Dissertation OU#ina before the doctoral committee will recommend candidacy. \u00b7 Commencement lnformati_on ooncerning commencement, caps and ga.Yns, invitations, tickels, time and placa, assembling and other relevent ilemS wHI be mailed to graduates by lhe Alumni Offica prior to lhe event Cancldates for advanoed degrees are requested and expected to attend lhe commenoement at which lhe University confers upon !hem lhe honer of the degree earned. \u00b7 Master's Degree Requirements In most master's degree programs, the minimum requirement for the degree is lhirty-two credlS under el1her Plan A or Plan B or Plan c as cited below. At leasttwenty--lourcredits must be taken in resicfenoe. At least six credilS of work in the major field, in add~ion to the essay or lhasis, must be in a,urses open only to graduate slUdenlS (a>urses numbered 700 and above). Plan_ A requires twe~our credits of coarse work plus an eighl credit thesis. Plan B requires twenty-nine credits of course work plus a three credit essay. \u00b7 Pla,n C requires thirty-two credits of coursework. Essay or thesis not required. Authorized only in selected areas. Most departmenls req~ire afWJl comprehensive by deparbnent; see listings under lhe individual departments for exact infonnation. In accordance with 1he Time Limitation of lhe Graduate School, aH requiremenlS for lhe masler's degree must be completed within a six-year period. DOCTORAL DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Preliminary Qualifying Examination Responsibility for preNminary qualifying examinations is vested in 1he graduate faculty of each deparbnent; specificelly, in its mmmittee on doctoral slUdy. Accordingly, committees may require lhis examination of all. ca~ or of any candidate prior to the final qualifying exam1natk>n. Final Qualifying Examination for Candidacy The final qualifying examination is required of all applicanls. AppHcanls may request their dac:toral committee ., aulhorize the final qualifying examination after an approved Plan of Worl< has been filed with the Graduate School. The examination will a,nsist of bo1h written and oral portions. When lhis examination hes been passed, and when the Dean of the Graduate School has approved 1he Dissertation OuUine, applicanls will be advanoed to the stalUs of 'doctoral candidate.' The written qualifying examination will cover the applicant's major and minor areas and may include such other related matters as the doctoral examining committee may prescribe. Within thirty days after the written examination has been pessed, lhe orel qualifying examination wil be conducted by lhe doctoral examining committee in the presence of the chairperson of lhe deparbnental committee on doctoral study or his/her designee and a graduate examiner approved by lhe Graduate School. This examination will relate to lhe subject matter of the written examination, the applicant's major and minor areas and other pertinent matters. If an examining committee does NOT certify !hat the applicant has passed either the written or oral examinations, it must make specific recommendations wllh referenoe to admitting the applicant to a second examination end specify any additional work lhat should be completed prior to such an examination. If a second examination is held, it must be scheduled within one calendar year and shall be considered final. SIUdent doctoral committees, including one member from oulSide of the student's department, are selected at 1he time lhe doctoral Plan of Work is prepared. For 1he Oral OuaUfying Examination, a Graduate Examiner outside of the student's department is appointed to lhe a,mmottee by the Graduate School. The Graduate Examiner files a brief report to 1he Graduate School detailing the conduct of the Oral Qualifying Examination. The Graduate Examiner also must be present at the final dissertation defense. Essays, Theses, and Dissertations There is no prescnbed fonn for the Mastefs essay. Essay guidelines, oncicabng standaod style manuals for each department and tilf8-1)8ge samples, are available in 1he Liberal Arts/Scienoe Graduate Office 2155 Faculty/Administration Building. \u00b7 ' Master's degree candidates under the essay plan register for the a,urse numbered 799, Master's Essay Direction, in the deparbnent of their major; a total of three credilS must be elected. The original copy of the essay should be submitted to 1he Liberal Arls/Scienoe Graduate Office after it is approved and signed by the adviser. This copy will be rewmed to lhe deparbnent. The lhesis or dissertation must be an original worl<, either in or dellnhe/y related to the student's major araa of specialization. If proper standards of quaUty, objectivity, originality, and independence are maintained, candidates may use dala which lhey have derived from their University research. Neither 1he resulls of lhe research nor the Colkge of Sc~nce 361 publication of findings can be restricted by any non-<miversity agency nor can they be published prior to acceptance by the Graduate School, unless prior approval of such publication has been secured from both lhe adviser and lhe Graduate School. Advisers have primary responsibility for approval of the essay or thesis, but every member of a doctoral committee must read, approve and sign the dissertation. Studen1S may not begin work on a manusaipt until they have submitted an approved Plan of Worlc and oudine form. They may then register for the thesis or dissertation and pay regular fees in the same manner as for all oth8r course work. Masters candidates under the thesis plan register for the course numbered 899 in the department of their major. This course is entided Master's Thesis Research and Direction and must be elected fora total of eight credi1S. Ph.D. candidates register for thirty credits in the course numbered 999 in their major field, Doctoral Dissertation Research and Direction. All credit used toward meeting dissertation requirements must be earned in this course.

Wolfson Assistant Professors Anthony UlCja Iwanska, Satycndra Rana Lecturer Degrees and Post Bachelor Certificate POST BACHEWR CERTIFICATE in Computer Science MASTER OF ARTS with a major in Computer Science MASTER OF SCIENCE with a major in Computer Science MASTER OF SCIENCE in Electronics and Computer Con1ro/ Systems-Interdisciplinary DOCTOR OF PHIWSOPHY with a major in Computer Science The Department of Computer Science offers instruction in the principles of design and use of computing and information systems. Underlying concepts are stressed which gi\\19 students the flexibility 10 manage the ever-increasing complexity of this rapidly-changing field. Th~ obJect1ve of the Department is to provide a learning environment which fosters the development of computer scientists possessing strong fundamental concepts. Students with widely . varying backgrounds and goals will find plans of study and research designed to meet their needs. Post Bachelor Certificate in Computer Science The certificate program in computer science is designed for students who have obtained an undergraduate or graduate degree in another discipline from an accredited university, and who wish 10 acquire undergraduate-level competence in computer science skills. Students whose background includes courses which satisfy the College of Science Group Requirements wiH generally apply for a second bachelofs degree rather than the Certificate in Computer Science. The Post Bachelor Certificate Program verifies completion of the technical courses required for the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Compu~ Saenoe and provides the minimal course requirements for admossoon 10 the graduate program in this field at Wayne State University. Students\u00b7 planning ID enter the graduate program in computer science are strongly advised ID take as many additional mathematics and computer science courses as their programs will allow, ID provide adequate background for graduate work. Admlaalon: Students who have received their undergraduate degree from Wayne State University should apply directly to the University Advising Center. Two copies of the student's transcript must be submitted 10 the University adviser. Students who have received their undergraduate degrees from another institution must complete the application for Undergtaduate Admossoon and request that official transcripts from the college or university granting their undergraduate degree be sent directly ID the Office of Admissions. CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS: Candidetes for this certificate must achieve a level of competence in mathematics and computer sciienos equivelent to completion of fifty _credits as set forth in the following program. Prior preparation at the undergraduate level as evidenced in transaipt notation or by demonstrable pro-ncy may be used 10 satisfy any of these requirements, except that twenty credits in computer science must be eamed at Wayne State University. Current program requirements are as follows (students should consult an adviser for recent updates). 1. A bachelofs degree or its equivalent in some discipline other than computer science with an honor point average of at least 2.0 from an accredited institution. 2. Mathematics 201,202 and 221. 3. Introductory Computer Scienos courses 101, 110, and 211. 4. Computer Science courses beyond the introductory level induding: (a) Computer Scienos 220,320,410,411, and 442. (b) Nine additional credits in Computer Science courses numbered 300 or above excluding CSC 490 and CSC 495. (c) At least twenty credits in Computer Science (CSC) courses must be taken at Wayne State Universi1y. (d) Note that CSC 450 is required for admission 10 the graduate program. (e) Minimum Computer Science honor point average of 2.5. (ij A minimum grade of 'C' is required in CSC 101, 11 O, and 211. Master's Degree Programs-\u00ad Admission and Matriculation The Department of Computer Science awards the degrees of Master of Arts and Master of Science with a major in computer science. The degrees are distinguished on the basis of relative diversity and concentration of curricula. The Master of Arts degree program offers students experience in many areas of comput;er science. The Master of Science degree is granted 10 students who pursue a more concentrated cluster of topics leading 10 a mastefs thesis. The great veriety of subjects which are part of computer science, together with the immense diversity of their applications, makes it imperative that students in the mastefs program maintain close contact with their advisers ID achieve a coherent plan of study directed toward a specific goal. In particular, elections of courses should be made with prior consultation and the approval of the student's adviser. Admlaofon 10 these programs is contingent upon admission 10 the Graduate Schoof; for requirements, see page 17. In addition, applocants are expected 10 have attained a level of scholarship in the baocalaureate program equal ID an honor point average of 3.0 or better, including adequate preparation in computer science and supporting courses in mathematics. NonnaUy, the entering student will be expacted 10 have fulfilled the equivalent of the.requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree at Wayne Stete University and 10 satisfy any de-ncies by successfully completing necessary course work, before becoming a candidate for an advanced degree. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for admission 10 the Master of Scienos or Master of Arts program. Also required for admission are three letters of recommendetion from faculty members of accredited colleges or universities and a statement of approximately 300 words describing the applicant's academic and professional goals. Co/leg, qJ Science 315 Studen1s planning to pursue some of the more technical courses may find it neoossary to have additional preparation in mathematics and'or computer scienos. The student should make a careful examinatiOn of the prerequisites for advanced courses in his/her areas of special interest before seeking admission. Prerequisite course work which is required as a condition of admission must be completed prior to electing graduate courses. Upon admission, each student is assigned an adviser for guidance and direction in meeting degree requiremen1s and academic goals. As the student's interests in COfflputer science become more refined, a change in adviser may be appropriate; fonns for this purpose are available from the Department Office. Such a change should be done before submitting the Plan of Worlr. candidacy: By_ the time twelve credi1s have been earned, a Plan of Work should be developed with the student's adviser and submitted to the Chairperson of the Computer Scienos Graduate Committee. In the Plan of Work the student indicates his/her choios of masters program Plans A or C (see below). Upon approval of the Plan of Work by the Graduate Committee and the Dean of the College of Scienos, the student is considered a degree candidate. The student is notpennitted to take more than twelve credits in the mastefs program unless candidacy has been established. If the student has not graduated after two years as a candidste, the Plan of Work will be reviewed for possible adjustment. Scholarship: Students must maintain a minimum overall 3.0 honor point average. Failure to do so for one semester places the student on academic probation. Failure todosofortwo semesters will result in the student's dismissal from the graduate program. All course work must be completed in accordance with the regulatiOns of the Graduate School and the College governing graduate scholarship and degrees; see pages 23-34 and 360--$2, respectively. The above requiremen1s are those in force as of the publicatiOn date of this bulletin; however, studen1s should keep in mind that the degree requirernen1s for any particular student are those in force at the time of his/her admission. - General Master's Degree Requirements Both the Master of Ans degree and the Master of Scienos degree have the following common requirements: 1. CSC 650 and 658. 2. CSC 890, Graduate Seminar (1 cradit). 3. The student must declare a major area of specialization and complete at least three courses, including at least one course at or above the 700 level, from this area. The three areas of conosntration are as follows: COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE Systems 5oitwa,e Engi'\"8ring 4. At least two additiOnal CSC courses must be completed, with at least one course at or above the 600 level. (CSC 790 does not satisfy this requirement.) 376 College of Sek nee I ,j, Master of Arts with a Major in Computer Science Admlsolon Requirements: see above.

In addition to thooa courses used to satisfy the common masters requiremen1s, at least two courses must be taken from a single area of concentration, including one course al or above the 700 level. Master of Science with a Major in Computer Science Admlaolon Requirements: see above. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The Master of Science degree is offered only as a Plan A optiOn, which requires thirty-three credi1s and includes the completion of a thesis for eight credi1s. The masters thesis work is directed by the student's adviser together with a committee of two additional faculty members. All committee members must read ahd approve the thesis, after which time it must be presented at a public session prior to final acceptance. Theses are technical papers describing the original creative work of the author. Students should see page 33 and consult the Graduate School for specifics of the format and presentation of the thesis. Course Requirements: The student must take a minimum of thirty-three credi1s, including those from the general master's requirements listed above, .as well as eight credits in the master's thesis (CSC 899). Master of Science in Electronics and Computer Control Systems The Department of Computer Science, in conjunction with the Departmen1s of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering of the College of Engineering, offers an interdisciplinary master's degree program in electronics and computer control systems. The program addresses the need for retraining and upgrading the engineering work force in the area of computer-based technology. Completion of this program requires the election of courses in computer science, mechantcal engineering, and electrical and computer engineering. For further information regarding curricular requiremen1s, studen1s should contact the Associate Dean of Engineering for Research and Graduate Studies; telephone: (313) 577-3861. Doctor of Philosophy With a Major in Computer Science The Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred upon individuals who ha,e demonstrated the ability to make original contributions to the knowledge of the field. The Ph.0. program develops expens and professionals who will continue in academic work; industry or government. It encourages the attainment of excellence in research and scholarship necessary to catalyze the advancement of computer science. The fulfillment of doctoral i'equirements is monitored primarily by examinations and the presentation of the dissertation rather than by the summatiOn of courses, grades and credits. The doctoral program emphasizes reseerch and the Department encourages prospective Ph.D. candidates to involve themselves in faculty projects at the B!l~iest possible opportunity. Admlaolon to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; lor requirements, see pege 17. The applicant should present a bachelor's or master's degree with a ma;or in computer or other scienoe. In adcition, applicants are expected to have attained a level of scholarship equal to a 3.3 honor point average or better in the most reoent degree from an accredited college or university, including adequate preparation in computer scienoe and supporting courses in mathematics. Normally, the entering student wiH be expected to have lu1fiHed the equivelent of the requirements for the Bachelor of Scienoe in Computer Science and to satisfy any deficiencies by sucoessful course work, before beooming a cancidate for the advanced degree. Applicants must take the Graduate Record Examination, both the Aptitude portion and the Advanced Test in any scienca or engineering discipltne. and be accepied by the Department of Computer Science Graduate Admissions Committee. Three letters of recommendation from laculty members of accredited colleges or universities must be submitted, along wilh a statement of approximately 300 words desaibing the applicant's goals and career objectives. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The Doctor of PhilosophY degree requires ninety credits. beyond the baccalaureate degree, thirty of which must be eamed as dissertation credit. All course won< must be completed in eccordance with the academic prooedures of the College and the Graduate School governing graduate scholarship and degrees; see pages ~2 and 23--'!4, respectively. The computer science doctoral program is designed to be flexible, in order to meet the incividual student's interests and to reflect the dynamic nature of the field. It is comprised of six major stages: 1. Program Sefeclfon: The first stage is devoted primarily to course won< and production of a Plan of Work in consultation with the adviser. The approved Plan of Worl< must designate primary and secondary fields of interest. The student is encouraged to define his/her own primery and secondery fields of interest bY forming a cohesive grouping of available graduate courses. The Plan of Worl< must include at least thirty credits in CSC course won< at or above the 700 level. Twenty-one of these credits must be in course worl< other than direcled study CSC 790. Both CSC 650 and CSC 658 must be elecled. 2. Pro fl cf ency Examination: During this stage, the student will take the Proficiency Examination which is intended to evaluate the preparation of the Ph.D. student. The student must have passed the examination by the end of the lour1h academic semester (for this accrual only Fall and Winter terms are regarded as academic semesters), and may take it no more than twice. Failure to satisfy this requirement will result in the student's wlthdrawal from the Ph.D. program. The Proficiency Examination Guide is available in the Department upon request. Meanwhile, the student continues the course won< outlined in the Plan of Work and begins the seerch for a dissertation topic. 3. Doctoral Committee Formadon: With the approval of the Department Graduate Committee, the student establishes a Doctoral committee which is composed of at least three faculty members from the Department and one faculty member from any other field that is relevant to the topic of the research. This Committee is responsible for directing the oral examination and cissertation of the candidete. 4. Quallfyfng Examination: The Qualifying Examination consists of two perts; the first part is writtan, and the second pert oral. A student may begin the written examination any time after formation of a doctoral committee and must pess both parts of the examination by the end of the sixth semester in the Ph.D. program. The student must take the oral examination within thirty days after C811ification of passing the written examination. Both examinations will cover the student's primery and secondery fields of study as specified in the student's Plan of Work, and may include other related areas which are relevant to the studenfs research. The writtan pert of the Qualifying Examination will be administered bY the student's Doctorol Committee. The oral part of the Qualifying Examination wil be administered bY the student's Doctoral Committee along with a representative from the Department Graduate Committee and a graduate examiner approved bY the Graduate School. If the examining committee does not certify that the student has passed either the writtan or the oral qualifying examination, it must make specific recommendations with relatence to admitting the student to a second examination and specify any adcitional won< tha1 must be complated priorto such examination. If a second examination is held, It must be sc:he<lJled within one calender year from the failed examination and shall be considered final. 5. Proapectua and Candidacy: With the major component of the course worl< complated, the student will finalize the selection of a dissertation topic by the development of the Prospectus. The Prospectus desaibes the proposed resasrch in some detail; It states the problem, its scope, the types of sources and resources required, the methodology to be used, prior reseerch results, and a description of the hypothetical results expected from the research. The Prospectus must then be presented to and approved bY the student's Doctoral Committee. The Prospectus is to be sucoessfuHy completed bY the end of the third academic year of the Ph.D. program. The Prospectus, along with the Doctoral Dissertation OUUine and Record of Approval, is then submitted to the Graduate School. 8. D1..-11on: The final stage is devoted primarily to research and preparation of the dissertation. The dissertation research is presented and defended before the Doctoral Committee in a public lecture presentation. Assistantships and Fellowships General sourcas of financial aid for graduate students maybe found in the section on Graduate Financial Assistance, beginning on patJB 34 of this bulle#n. The number and nature of assistantships vary each academic year. Graduate teaching or research assistamships and feHowships are available each year to qualified students. Those interested should submit application materials to the Department of Compuler Scienoe bY Februery 15 for the fall term, and by October 15 for the winter term of the preceding academic years. Late applications will .be considered only on the basis,of available positions.

Simms Master of Science in Geology The Master of Science in Geology consisls of advanced studies which are designed to prepare the student to assume a position of responsibility as a professional geologist; or to enter a program leading to the doctor of philosophy in geology or a related discipline at another university. The Master of Science in Geology offers a program with emphasis on environmental and urban geology in keeping with the urban setting of Wayne State University. This program is designed to prepare the student to assume a position of responsibility as a professional geologist with special training in the environmental aspecls of this discipline. Studenls receiving the degree ot Master of Science in Geology will be especially prepared to work in a capacity which deals with or provides solutions to environmental problems in which an intimate relationship between the environment and earth science is an important factor. The maste(s degree program involves the rigorous, in-depth study of major concepls pertaining to the earth, and the techniques used to study them. Entrance into the program assumes a firm foundation in the basic and elemental concepts of geology. Admission to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17. Additionally, candidates are required to have an undergraduate major in geology, or a strong background in geology supported by courses in related sciences, and with an honor point average of at least 3.0 in the major. Prerequisite study should indude mineralogy, petrology, sedimentation, geomorphology, and structural geology, plus a course in any two of the following fields: paleontology, geophysics, geological site assessment, and geophysics. Six or more credits in field geology or the equivalent is also required. Two semesters of calculus, a year of chemistry and a year of physics are also necessary. A reading knowledge of French, German or Russian is strongly recommended but not required. Deficiencies in prerequisites may be made up concurrendy with graduate work. The verbal, quantitative and advanced parts of the Graduate Record Examination are required for admission to the graduate program, and the applicant must file three personal letters of recommendation before acceptance. Students transferring from other fields should make an appointment with the Graduate Officer or the Department Chairperson who will review the applicant's background and make recommendations regarding the graduate program. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The master's degree is offered by this department only under the following option: Plan A: Thirty-two credils including an eight credit thesis. Students must comptete twenty-four credits in graduate course work including the following required courses: GELSOO, 512,515,530, and 545. The additional five credils in required course work may be selected from other graduate courses in geology, or from greduate courses in chemical and/or civil engineering, or graduate courses in chemistry or physics. Graduate courses in disciplines other than geology require lhe approval of lhe lhesis adviser and lhe graduate committee. Eight credilS in thesis (GEL 899) are also required. All course work must be oompleted in accordance wilh lhe academic procedures of lhe College of Science and lhe Greduate School governing graduate scholarship and degraes; see pages 360--$2 and 2341, respectively. The graduate program may be modified by lhe Geology Department to conform to lhe needs of individual cancidales. The eight thesis crecilS must be in geology, but lhe lhesis crecilS will not be oounted as constituting part of lhe nineteen crecits in Geology course work. Candidacy for lhe Masters degree is established by submitting an acceptable Plan of Work to lhe Graduate Officer of lhe College of Science. This plan must be submitted and approved by lhe College by lhe time twelw graduale crecits haw been earned. Once candidacy is established, lhe studen~ in consultation wilh his/her adviser and lhe Geology Department graduate officer, will select lhe lhesis oommittee.

Graduate Scholarship All graduate degrees are governed by general University regulations. Information concerning these may be found in the College of Sctence Academic Regulations saction of this bulletin (pages 3~62) and also in the Graduate School section (pages 23-34 ). Degree applicants are expected to inform themselves concsming th8S8 regulations and to take the responsibility of_ conforming to them. Additional requirements for specific graduate degrees in mathematics are explained below. Master of Arts Degrees in Mathematics Admlaalon to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17. 384 Colltgt of Science ' ,, Except for the program leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics, the entrance requirements for the master's programs in mathematics and statistics include successful completion of twelve semester credits in mathematics beyond sophomore calculus (equivalent to MAT 201, 202, 203, 225, and 235); this course work should include advanced calculus and linear or modem algebra. Credit acaued in courses such as the history of mathematics or the teaching of mathematics, in which the study of mathematics itself is not the primary purpose will not be counted toward this requirement. As preparation for graduate study, the Mathematics Depar1mentstrongly recommends undergreduate course work along the line of option A, described under Bachelofs Degrees in the undergraduate bulletin. - With a Major in Mathematics DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The Master of Arts with a Major in Mathematics is offered under the following options: Plan A: Twenty-four credits in course wor.k plus an eight credit thesis. . Plan B: Twenty-seven credits in course work plus a three credit essay. Plan C: Thirty credits in course work. Complation of these plans must satisly the following criteria: 1. At least twenty-four credits must be earned in course work from the Mathematics Department. Credits earned toward a thesis or essay in accordance with Plan A or Plan B may be included among these twenty-four credits. 2. Election of Mathematics 542, 543. 560 and 561, if not previously completed. Election of Mathematics 650 or 660, if not previously completed. 3. Election of at least two of the following, if not previously completed: Mathematics 510,522,523, 541, 553, 570, 577, 582, 587. These courses represent several areas of applied_ mathematics. 4. Election of at least one additional mathematics course numbered 600, or higher, with the exception of Mathematics 799, 899 and teacher preparation courses. 5. By the time twelve credits have boon earned a Plan of Work, approved by a departmental adviser, should be submitted to the drector of the master's program in. mathematics. At this time, the Graduate Commill8e will act on the application for candidacy. The student will not.be allowed to take more than twelve credits in the master's program unless candidacy has been established. 6. In the Plan of Work the student will state his or her choice of one of the plans A. B, 01 C. The choice of plan must be approved by the Graduate Committee. 7. There is a final oral examination for the master's degree. All students in Plan C are required to take this examination. Students in Plan A or B may, upon recoin!llendation of the thesis or essay adviser, be excused from the final oral examination by the Graduate Committee. 8. Students in Plan A or B are required to present their thesis or essay in a public lecture. NOTE: Candidates for the Master of Arts degree with a major in mathematics or in mathematical statistics are exempt from the requirement of the Graduate School that six credits in the major field must be in courses numbered 700 and above. Comput Science Cognate: For.students interested in computer science, suitable cognates are: Computer Science 568,650,658,662. Secondary Teaching Option: To exercise this option a student should declare specializatton in secondary teaching on the Plan of Work. The student should also have, or be in the process of obtaining, a certificate to teach in the secondary schools. Once approved for this option, the student may, if desired, modily the requirements for the Master of Arts degree in any or all of the following ways: ' a) substitute Mathematics 615 for 570 in satisfying requirement three. b) add Mathematics 614 to the list of optional courses used in satisfying requirement four. . -with a Major in Mathematical Statistics The requirements for this degree differ from those for the Master of Arts with a major in mathematics (see ebove) only in that the 1hrea requirements 2, 3, and 4 ere replaced by a single one: 2. Election of Mathematics 542,543,560. 561,570, 582and 780, ff not previously completed. Election of Mathematics 650 or 660, if not previously completed. Mathematics 760 is recommended. It is stressed that all other requirements (1, 5, 6 and 7 above) ere the same, exceptthet the essay under Plan B must be written in the area of mathematical statistics. - in Applied Mathematics This degree is de_signed for students who are interested in applied mathematics or are interested in applying mathematics to areas outside of mathematics (e.g., biology, chemistry, computer science, economics, engineering, geology, medical science, physics, psychology, social science). The progrem is flexible in that it does not represent the teaching of any fixed body of knowledge. It does require two areas of concentration, one of these being the major in mathematics (pure and applied) with emphasis cin the applicable subjects. The minor area is to be either in applied mathematice or in an area outside of mathematics (such as the above) to which the student is interested in applying mathematics. Mathematical methods are emphasized. Admlaalon to this program is contingent upon admission to the Graduate School; for requirements, see page 17. Applicants for the program leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics must have ei1her twelve credits beyond the calclJlus sequence or knowledge equivalent to Mathematics 201-203, 225, 235,507,542, Computer Science 211 and a good background in some area in which .he or sha is planning to apply mathematics. A bachelofs degree In mathematics is not required. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: This program is usually offered as a Plan 8 mastefs degree option requiring twenty-nine credits of course work plus a three credit essay. However, -mastefs degree options (see above under Major in Mathematics) may be elected with the approval of the Departmental Graduate Committee. Specific requirements for the degree are as follows: 1. A minimum of thirty-two credits. 2. A minimum of sixteen credits in mathematics courses not previously completed and numbered 507 or above (except courses for teachers). 3. At least four additional a-edits in mathematics courses as oudined in (2), above. 4. Each student must declare a minor (e.g., one of the areas mentioned ebove) in which he or she is planning to apply mathematics, and have at leest eight credilS in that area in addition to thosa required above. 5. The entire program of study must be a coordinated one that meets with the approval of the student's academic adviser, who will be assigned upon admission. Each student in this program will ordinarily be required to write a project-type essay for three credits under the direction of a supervisor in the Mathematics Department and an essay adviser from some department related to the minor area, both of whom must approve the essay. (If the chosen minor area is in applied mathematics, the advisar in the major area can be the same as the adviser in the minor area.) The selection of advisers and topics must be approved by the Graduale Committee of the Mathematics Department. Doctor of Philosophy with a Major in Mathematics All applicanlS for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with a major in mathematics are urged first to study the general University requirements for this degree and to plan their programs so that all lhosa requiremenlS are fulfilled in the proper Older and at the proper times. Listed below are the major steps in eeming this degree. Specific requirements of the Mathematics Department are included. Admloalon lo this program is contingent upon admission to the Greduale Schoof; for requiremenlS, see page 17. Doctoral applican1S must have completed a mastefs degree in mathematics or reached an equivalent level of advancement The [)epertment Gradual8 Comminae may make exceptions to this rule in cases where unusual abiity has been demonstrated. Admission lo the doctoral progrern wiU be granted only to lhosa whose records indicate an ability to succeed in advanced study and research. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS: Candidates for the doctoral degree must completa ninaty credits in course work beyond the bachelofs degree, including thirty credilS of dissertation direction. Additional specific requiremenlS for this degree in mathematics are as follows: Preliminary Examination are two 2-hour written tests, covering undergraduate level malerial in analysis and algebra (from a sophisticated point of view). A student who is admitted to the Ph.0. program must teke the Prelimin81)' Examination within the first two scheduled examination sessKJns after the date of admission. Arr, delay in taking the examinations must be approved in advance by the Graduate Committee. Language Examlnadono: StudenlS are expected to show proficiency, at the level of translating mathematical literature, in two modem languages other than English. Examiners and exam fonnat will be delannined on an individual basis by the Graduate Commitlae. One language exam must be in French, Gennan, or Russian, and this examination must be passed before completion of the wrillan examinations. The second language may be any language in which there is a substantial body of modem mathematical Nlerature, including computer languages. The second language exam must be passed before the Defense of Dissertation is scheduled. Couroe Requlremento: In addition to the examinations described ebove, before advancement to candidacy every student in Iha Ph.D. program must complete each of the four courses with a grade of 'B' or bettar: MAT 740, 750, 760, and 660. Qualifying Examlnatfono consist of two sections, a written and an oral examination. A student must begin the written qualifying examination by the end of the third year in the Ph.D. program, and must pass all parts of the examination by the end of the fourth yeer in the Ph.D. program. Written Clua.ifying Examinations consist of two 3-hour parts, a major and a minor area exam. The examination committee will give 1he student a list of topics in the studenrs area of specialization. These topics should both reflect the student's particular research interest and be of sufficient breadth to cover the entire area. The committee will also designale a minor aree on which the student will be examined. The minor area is to be supportive of the major area but sufficienlly different to avoid compromising the diversity of the total two-part exam. Further, the first language examination must be passed before completing the Qualifying Examinations. Oral Qualifying Examinations: By University regulations, aft8r passing the written Qualffying Examinations, a student must\u00b7 teke an oral Qualifying Examination within thirty days after certification of passing the written exam. The oral examination committee consists of the written examination committee, a representative of the Graduate Committee, and, per University regulations, a representative of the Graduala Dean. The oral examination will normany cover malarial similar to that of the written examinations, but may also include College of Scie,ace 385 material outside the written examination areas which is deemed relevant to the student's research work. Defense of Dluertatlon: Candidates must pass a final oral examination covering their research after the candidate's adviser has approved the _completed dissertation.

No more than two courses at the 600 level may be applied toward credit for the doctoral degree. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS In order that students may acquire a broad background in the factual and theoretical content of psychology, four substantive courses are required of all doctoral candidates: PSY 701 and 709, plus two of the following: PSY 708, 712, 725, 740, 762. To supplement these and to emphasize the quantitative approach in psychology, two advanced courses in psychological statistics and measurement, PSY 715 and 716, are required. Each student is expected to select a major and minor area of specialization from among the following list. (Alternate minor areas may be developed in consultation with relevant faculty, subject to the approval of the Department Graduate Committee.) BIOPSYCHOLOGY: The biopsychology program offers intensive course work and research training in brain-behavior relationships. Research is concentrated in the areas of the neurochemistry and neuroanatomy of learning and seizure activity, the psyche>-pharmacology of drugs of abuse, the neuroanatomy and physiology of aging, developmental behavioral toxicology and teratology, and the neurochemical bases of food intake and body weight regulation. All of these research areas are supported with up-to-<late equipment and extensive laboratory space. The biopsychology program is affiliated with the University's interdisciplinary program in the neurosciences. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY: Students in this specialty area take courses in c~nical research, psychopathok>gy, assessment methods, and lherapeutic interventions. Requirements also include supervised experience in assessment and treatment of clients in practicum courses and during an internship. Special opportunities for training and research in neuropsychology, developmental psychopathology, health, and community psychology are available in the clinical program. COGNITIVE PROCESSES: Students in this program receive training in basic cognitive research and theory and its application to applied problems. Basic theoretical research focuses on the psychology of language and cognition and memory. Special opportunities for applied research are also available. DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY emphasizes a Hie-span approach and provides specialization in cognitive and emotional changes from infancy to old age. Emphasis is on general principles of developmen~ but each student may select an age renge for special consideration. For research on young children, the Psychology Department's child development laboratories are available. Cooperative arrangements for research exist with lhe Merrill-Palmer lnstibJta and the instibJta for Geroniology. Research opportunities with normal and exoeptional populations are available. INDUSTRIAWRGAN/ZA TIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 0118111 concentration in criterion development, performance evaluation, pensonnel selection, employee training and development, motivation and morale, leadership and executive developmen~ and employee-management relations.

Opportunities exist for field experienos in various agencies and organizations in the community. Realdence: Ail new doctoral sbJdents must enroll for their first academic year on a fulJ--time basis. Students must complete at least six three--credlt courses, exclusive of research and thesis credits, during the first year. Any incompletes in these six courses must be removed prior to the fail semestar of the second year. Examination: Final qualifying examinations, which include a research design and methodology portion and a written and oral examination covering both the student's major and minor areas, are required. These are normally taken after completion of the masta(s thesis and sixty credits in graduata coursewor1<. An oral examination on the dissertation topic is also required upon its completion. Training, Taechlng, and R-rch: Doctoral students are required to participate in a training assignment each academic year they are in residenos. This is required of all loll-time student&, imlspective of whether the !raining assignment includes a stipend. The sbJdent's area committee is responsible for seeing that this requirement is met each year. The !raining assignment involves appropriate teaching, research (other than thesis or dissertation research) or professional activities. \u00b7 Financial Support General sources of Nnancial aid for gra<*Jate students may be found in the section on Gracilate Financial Assistance, beginning on page 34 of this bulletin.

For further information on these requirements, see page 17. Preference is given to those students who have achieved superior undergraduate scholastic records and who have evidenced superior abrnties. All prerequisite credits must be earned prior to or concurrently with the !iist graduate creats. If undergraduate preparation for the major field is considered deficient, additional work may be required at the undergraduate level. Many programs have additional individual admission requirements. Students should consult the subsequent departmental sections in this bulletin for specific requirements in each field of study. Graduate Record Examinations The Graduate Record Examination (GAE) is used to assist advisers in evaluating educational preparation and to serve as a basis for planning future study. There is no uniform policy concerning GREs; scme departments require GAE sco,es from all applicants for admission, while others require scores only from students in specified classifications. Students should consult the department in which they wish to major to determine which examinations must be taken. Students required to take these examinations must apply at the Testing and Evaluation Office, 698 Student Center, either prior to or at the time of admission. Students who previously have taken the examination may have transcripts of these scores submitted. After the initial registration, no subsequent enrollment will be permitted nor will candidacy be authorized until examination requirements have been fulfilled. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Graduate degrees are conferred not merely upon the completion of a prescribed number of courses nor-necessarily after a given period of residence, but rather in recognition of each candidate's outstanding ability and high attainments as evidenced in all course work, research, scholarly writing, examinations and personal fitness for a chosen profession. All course work must be completed in accordance with the academic procedures of the Graduate School (see pages 23-34) and the regulations of the College of Urban, Labor, and Metropolitan Affairs. In addition to the general Graduate School requirements for degrees and to the information provided below, other requirements are specified by the individual graduate departments.

Master's degree candidates under the essay plan register for the course numbered 799, Master's Essay Direction, in the department of their major; a total of three credits must be elected. The original copy of the essay should be submitted to the College Graduate Office after it is approved and signed by the adviser. This copy will be returned to the department. The thesis must be an original work, either in or definitely related to the student's major area of specialization. If proper standards of quality, objectivity, originality, and independence are maintained, candidates may use data which they have derived from their University research. Neither the results of the research nor the publication of findings can be restricted by any non-university agency nor can they be published prior to acceptance by the Graduate School, unless prior approval of such publication has been secured from both the adviser and the Graduate School. Advisers have primary responsibility for approval of the essay or thesis. Master's candk:lates under the thesis plan register for the course numbered 899 in the department of their major.
