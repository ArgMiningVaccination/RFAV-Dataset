The retired engineer and tax consultant, now 70, moved to this community in Paraguay with his partner Gerhild Wichmann in October 2020. They live in a small house with an enormous garden and orchard, where Mr Heinz tends to the outdoor space while Wichmann tinkers with the piano. This could be any holiday compound; a retreat under the hot South American sun. Yet El Para\u00edso Verde is no ordinary destination. Within its fenced-off perimeter lies the world's largest settlement for 'awakened' people from across the globe; a safe space for [Covid sceptics](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/12/17/may-not-realise-lockdown-sceptics-have-won-omicron-war/) to seek freedom from '5G, chemtrails, fluoridated water, mandatory vaccinations, and healthcare mandates', as one promotional video puts it. Since the pandemic began, [vaccine refuseniks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/16/one-shot-vaccines-could-targeted-refuseniks-covid-hotspots/) from everywhere from Germany to Switzerland, Australia and America have moved in their hundreds to this neighbourhood seven miles from Caazap\u00e1, a ranching town, where armed guards patrol the commune's newly built borders. On the African archipelago of Zanzibar, part of Tanzania, another group, Liberty Places, partly funded by British anti-vaccine activist Michael Yeadon, is similarly promising to build a 'life raft' community where people disenchanted by [coronavirus lockdowns](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/uk-coronavirus-lockdown/) and vaccine requirements can escape the 'Covid lunacy' of Europe for a 'new free life'. Meanwhile, a German doctor is attempting to organise Tanzanian safaris for the [Querdenker](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/09/21/german-man-felt-cornered-coronavirus-restrictions-shot-dead/) or 'lateral thinker' movement - Germany's answer to [QAnon](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/qanon/) - while 'awakened' Brits have begun seeking to date, share houses and homeschool their children with others who share their beliefs. These self-described freedom seekers are on a mission to reclaim the word 'woke' - usually associated with Western social progressives - and are, in some cases, moving thousands of miles away from home in search of autonomy of mind and body. Together, these attempts represent a growing movement by lockdown and vaccine sceptics to separate from mainstream society and form their own communities, much as hippies and new age believers did in the 1960s and '70s. 'Life is easier here than in Germany,' says Heinz from the shade of his garden in El Para\u00edso Verde. He and Wichmann were fed up with what he describes as a particularly European penchant for 'regulations, rules, and taxes', which give people 'the feeling that they work and work, and very little money is for me, and a lot of money goes away'. In Para\u00edso, he adds, they can 'be free'. In their house they have a bookshelf from which neighbours are welcome to borrow, including tomes on homeopathy, the 'Nazi origin' of the European Union, and why water is in fact not water at all. Paraguay is no stranger to disenfranchised groups seeking a new home. Mennonites, Australian socialists and the Unification Church have all relocated there in the past decade, seeking escape from the naysayers in their own countries. As far back as 1886, the country was home to Nueva Germania, the proto-fascist colony founded by Elizabeth Nietzsche, the philosopher's sister, who envisioned Latin America's first Aryan province. El Para\u00edso Verde, which simply means 'The Green Paradise', was established in August 2016. Its founders, Erwin and Sylvia Annau, say they were pursuing 'the dream of a better life and a future outside the Matrix', fleeing 'socialist trends around the world'. On the project's website, they add: 'We are not gurus and not cult leaders. We firmly reject that... we don't want to lead you, nor \"teach\" you.' The Annaus did not respond to a request for an interview. A 'like-minded' community Today, with the alluring strapline that it is 'open to all people who think and feel with their hearts', the 1,600-hectare enclave is hoping to attract 20,000 'like-minded' residents to share their distrust of vaccines, and dismay at how their governments have responded to the pandemic. Last June, while Paraguay recorded the highest Covid death rate per capita in the world, Para\u00edso was posting videos of its parties to its nearly 7,000 YouTube subscribers: an advert for the freedom they believe the pandemic has denied them. Heinz and Wichmann had been to Paraguay once before by the time of their move, yet they see themselves staying for the foreseeable future. New residents sign contracts of different lengths, prices and stipulations - some want a garden, others several hectares - beginning with a trial period of a week. After that seven-day stretch, explains Juan Buker, the site's Argentinian manager, 'we see if we fit in, if we have the same ideas'. Though each home has its own kitchen, often there are 100 or so residents eating together in the nature reserve's dining room; there are carpenters, masons, farmers, waiters and cooks among the 600 staff (twice the current number of those living there), all of whom are Paraguayan. The website offers assurances that the settlement, lined with rows of white houses and much of it under construction, is still small, and that reports of an influx are simply the result of 'Bill Gates sponsors trying to warm up all these rumours'. They promise that 'our green paradise will be a place of freedom and integrity. Free speech, freedom of expression and science, as well as access to unmandated holistic healthcare, is everyone's right.' Said healthcare - with respect for 'bodily autonomy' or 'integrity', as it is often called by those who have chosen to remain unvaccinated (including tennis star [Novak Djokovic](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2022/02/15/should-novak-djokovic-vaccinated-yes-should-banned-absolutely/)) - is delivered by on-site naturopath Uwe Cramer. His treatments include ozone therapy (administering the gas to the body to treat a wound or disease), autologous blood therapy (where blood is taken from one part of the body and readministered to a problem area), and radionics, also known as electromagnetic therapy, which holds that radiation given off by living matter can be interpreted and treated at a distance by electrical instruments. There is also a school on site, and plans for a Para\u00edso university in the offing. The group has met often with local and national officials; Gladys Rojas, a former president of Caazap\u00e1's town council, alleges that it has the backing of the former Paraguayan president Horacio Cartes (two of his family members have been board members of Reljuv, which owns the resort). El Para\u00edso Verde estimates that around one million people moved to Paraguay in 2021, while Germans have upped their application rate twentyfold since 2015. Others are sceptical. 'Why are they here? We don't know, but we want to find out,' former municipal councillor Rodney Mereles told a newspaper. Caazap\u00e1's head of public health Dr Nadia Riveros said she fears revival of coronavirus in the area, which has only one fully outfitted ambulance and no intensive care beds. 'I think foreigners, wherever they're from, should have to get vaccinated before entering the country,' she argued. Vaccine passports are a condition of entry in Paraguay, but questions remain over how rigorously this is enforced. Though less than half of Paraguay's population has had both jabs, even that figure dwarfs the 4.3 per cent full vaccination rate in Tanzania. The east African republic became a global leader in lax Covid restrictions under former president John Magufuli, who used the power of the state to suppress media outlets that questioned his June 2020 declaration that Tanzania was 'coronavirus-free'. For much of the pandemic, Magafuli stopped all coronavirus testing, arrested doctors who dared to criticise his policies, claimed that the country had been saved from the 'satanic' virus by prayer and advocated steam rooms as a cure for Covid-19 infections. Last March he died of what officials described as heart problems and opposition leaders alleged was the virus itself. One even called it 'poetic justice'. On Telegram, a private messaging app popular with conspiracy theorists and the far Right which has about 220,000 active users in the UK, members of 'awakened' chatrooms frequently cite Tanzania, and especially Zanzibar, as a choice travel destination. After Magafuli's death, the country did start asking travellers to show a negative PCR test, but it has never required they be vaccinated, and fake test certificates are widely circulated online. The promise of self-sufficiency It is on Zanzibar's main island of Unguja that a British-led group called Liberty Places has promised to build a series of self-sufficient estates, billing itself as a coalition of 'lifestyle architects, investment advisors and property developers leading free people in creating new opportunities and self-sufficient lives', with options available 'for all pockets'. The project's page promises shared villas for 'living alongside like-minded sceptics with full facilities and open views'. Founded in spring 2021, it is now working to open an office in Zanzibar by April, with several staff already having moved there. 'We welcome everyone who shares our vision of a life more in harmony with nature and natural health,' says the group in a statement to The Telegraph. 'Over the decades people have regularly become disenchanted with Western civilisation and sought other places to live and thrive. In this context Liberty Places [is] not at all new. 'What is new, perhaps, is that so many people from very established communities are now asking themselves if the life they've always known will resemble the future they're being offered? We intend to offer those people a choice and address their questions and anxieties around liberty, autonomy, and security.' Elsewhere in Tanzania, German doctor Bodo Schiffmann, a leading light of the anti-lockdown 'lateral thinker' movement who has called for a military intervention over the country's coronavirus policies, is reportedly attempting to organise safaris for supporters. According to the German news website T-Online, his wife told Telegram followers: 'I don't want to discriminate against anyone, but I don't want Bodo sitting in a jeep with someone who has been vaccinated' - because vaccines are 'deadly poison'. Conspiracy theories and manifestation In Liberty Places' own Telegram channel, which had just under 1,000 members at the time of writing, the group regularly shares updates and answers interested users' questions, interspersed with discourses on civilisation in the Covid age and anti-vaccine videos. They post images showing radiant white sands fringing crystal-clear turquoise waters, an outdoor bath overlooking verdant greenery, and a remote workspace opening directly on to a palm-lined beach. They urge followers to raise their own vibrations and move on from past ways of life, declaring: 'Before you can truly live freely you must surrender to the truth that you may have inadvertently built a prison around you.' Elle Taylor, a British self-described 'manifestation coach', is heavily involved in the project. In between posting explainers on how we are all 'electromagnetic' to her 14,000 Instagram followers, she explains how the UK has been a victim of 'mass psychosis' and promotes theories of how Covid-19 vaccines are being used to spread HIV and microchips. 'This stuff is getting crazier now. All this talk about HIV. All this talk of it being in the spike protein. Now all of a sudden we've got the biggest rates of HIV in straight people in the last 10 years. All coincidence, obviously... it's about totalitarian, one-government control. We know that,' Taylor says in a recent video post, set against the azure waters of the Indian Ocean. Taylor encourages her 'awake' followers to join her in Zanzibar, which she describes as being like Barbados 30 years ago, with little government oversight or technology, making it easy for Westerners to play by their own rules. 'Your journey is to be awake... the only thing standing between this plan [of world domination] being carried out or not is us, the resistance. Be grateful, feel privileged you're part of that,' she says. Some reports name Liberty Places' founders as Michael Yeadon, a British former Pfizer pharmacologist turned antivax activist, and Narice Bernard, an East Lothian businessman. Indeed, the group's early Facebook posts prominently feature Yeadon and his wife Joannna, and appear to be written as if he is leading the project, while Bernard often responded to users' questions on the group's behalf. One Instagram post says the Yeadons' involvement is proof that its community will be 'filled with the most authentic & empathetic liberal neighbours you could hope for'. Yeadon is one of many medics to have ridden the pandemic's online counterculture wave to leverage himself to martyr status. Following [his claims in 2020 that the Covid jab caused infertility](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/covid-19-vaccine-fertility-myth-lapped-globe/), researchers at King's College London found that seven per cent of UK adults, or 3.8 million people, believed the same. His influence has been pernicious and widespread, attracting fans across the country for his views on vaccines even though he had never worked with them by the time he left Pfizer in 2011. However, a spokesperson for Liberty Places says Yeadon provided early seed funding but now has 'no executive function or financial interest in Liberty Places Corporation or any of its subsidiaries'. The spokesperson declined to specify the nature of Yeadon's current role or to discuss Bernard's involvement, saying only: 'Liberty Places is a new kind of private sector organisation... none of us now involved seek to take individual credit for our brand, identity, or perceived success.' The group is less shy about its architect Sean Clifton, who is certified in the Passivhaus method of building low-energy sustainable homes. It is planning a 'health village', taking an 'integrative approach' using 'traditional and alternative medicine' alongside 'allopathic' drugs (a word used by alternative medicine advocates to refer to mainstream healthcare). It also intends to use blockchains, the technology behind cryptocurrency, to create a 'fair' and 'transparent' new digital economy. The spokesperson insists that Liberty Places is not an anti-vaccine community, describing Covid immunisation as only one catalyst for a comprehensive sense of disenchantment. They say the West's response to Covid-19 is only one step in an ongoing march towards totalitarian social control, and claim vaccinated people will be welcome in their community too. Indeed, the group's posts on Telegram evoke a worldview that goes deeper than Covid. It argues that digital payments and vaccine passports are the beginnings of a Western 'social credit system', referring to China's ambitious plan to give all its citizens and businesses a unified 'trustworthiness' rating based on a wide range of behaviour from cheating in online video games to failing to attend restaurant bookings to pet ownership and social media posts. Liberty Places is intended to 'prepare for this inevitability'. The West as an 'occupied territory' In other posts, the group describes Europe as 'occupied territory' and the West as an 'open prison', which it calls 'a structural phenomenon that's grown up over the decades'. It wants to lead 'a revolution of thought and mind', beginning civilisation again in the birthplace of humanity. In March it posted a graphic of frequencies measured in hertz, assigning them various emotional states such as 'peace', 'anger', and 'enlightenment'. 'This is not the first time the planet's frequency has changed and human cells [been] interfered with due to meddling technology,' it said. 'We as individuals... [can] take responsibility to move ourselves up that vibration scale.' The vision appeals to Liberty Places' followers, though many have doubts or questions. 'The biggest fear is lack of means to live,' says one. 'Zanzibar sounds lovely, but if there is nothing to do there to earn there is no point moving.' Some are concerned that Tanzania may not be safe from 5G mobile internet or digital ATMs. Yet others ask hopefully about WiFi, taxes, visas, and good places for a scouting holiday. 'Who wouldn't want to be part of this super-smart way of life, shared with kindred spirits, surrounded by the best of mother nature and breathtaking beauty?' asked one. Another lamented: 'It's raining here! Your photo is helping me know what I have to look forward to.' Behind it all is a palpable longing for safety and community, reminiscent of the counterculture boom of the '60s and '70s. Back then, those alienated from mainstream society by the collapse of organised religion or the violence in Vietnam and America's segregated South turned to new mystical ideas, flocking to 'intentional communities' founded around unconventional new visions. Some collapsed, some survived, others evolved into cults like Heaven's Gate; these days, many intentional communities have turned to Airbnb to attract new guests. Is something similar happening now? And if so, can the 'awakened' really escape the world order they have come to despise? The perfect breeding ground The pandemic has set the scene for conspiracies to flourish: last year, a study by French research centre Cevipof found that 31 per cent of UK respondents believed health ministries were in cahoots with pharmaceutical firms to hide jab risks, while 41 per cent agreed Covid was an opportunity for the Government to 'control and monitor' citizens. Research has also shown significant cross-pollination with other conspiracy theories - including QAnon, the online phenomenon that prompted the storming of the US Capitol last year - giving rise to a 'cultic milieu', where those with differing fringe beliefs come together in their rejection of the dominant culture. That process may have been accelerated by social networks' algorithms, which sometimes recommend new conspiracy groups to people who have already shown an interest in others. Yet Arthur Goldwag, author of the book [Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies](https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Arthur-Goldwag/Cults-Conspiracies-and-Secret-Societies/13992911), says that the organisations behind the Tanzanian and Paraguayan islands are 'more opportunistic' than those of decades past, with the groups instead focused on 'trying to make a little money out of people's fear, ignorance, and alienation'. This has been easily done during the pandemic thanks to societal instability and our reliance on social media - of particular concern for parents, whose teenagers have spent more time online than in the classroom since Covid hit. Conspiracy groups and cults operate by seeking out 'vulnerable people', Goldwag explains, offering them 'certainty and clarity'. For today's young people, that promise is compelling, because you 'would naturally be very worried about your future. There's a lot of vulnerability, and social media is a wonderful tool to get inside people's heads.' Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the London-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, accuses big tech platforms of 'exacerbating the crisis'. He says: 'Social media sites are based on algorithms that promote contentious, highly engaging content over fact. Too often, people searching for answers have instead been directed straight towards conspiracy theorists and fearmongers.' Ian Haworth of the Cult Information Centre (CIC) agrees, saying: '[Conspiracists are] using the internet very effectively, unfortunately... people take more trouble buying a car than they do when getting involved with a group that could destroy their lives.' Goldwag points out a long tradition of opposition to major vaccines, such as polio more than six decades ago. Like the Covid jab, the polio vaccine 'changed the world, and met with a lot of resistance - with backlash mainly from the far Right, religious groups, and those concerned with \"bodily integrity\"'. In the wake of mandated health orders then as now, freedom crusaders are born, intent to 'create utopian communities based on a single idea'. Goldwag warns that we should be 'very suspicious' of these new founders' motivations - not least because the near-universal spread of Covid-19 makes the potential scale of disinformation about it 'overwhelming'. History, Goldwag says, shows that conspiracy groups centred around one issue 'never last'. But he warns that if their rejections of the likes of 5G and conventional health treatment grow larger, and the 'cultic milieu' takes hold, the combined effect could be powerful. For the 'awakened', having a like-minded community in which to immerse themselves makes them feel stronger and safer. 'I don't know if [Covid] is a virus, but if it is a disease... for most people it is not deadly,' says the El Para\u00edso Verde naturopath Uwe Cramer. Back in Germany, his views meant 'there is no place for us'. Ten and a half thousand miles away, he finally feels at home. Additional reporting by Santi Carneri and Will Brown "}
