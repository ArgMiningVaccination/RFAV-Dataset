Where I studied Massage Therapy at the RealLife Integrative School of Massage & Bodywork. I have certifications through FSMTB & NCBTMB. I found myself fascinated with the mind and body connection through my own healing/health journey. This led me to wanting to help the greater collective through massage therapy. I'm passionate about helping others with their health and wellness, cultivating bonds, providing calming and nurturing environments for individual's growth. Helping through bodywork for the well-being of mind, body, and soul. Each session, intuitively listening and asking the patients' body for what it needs to help bring relief physically and emotionally. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my pets and partner, reading/learning, weight-lifting/yoga, being in nature (particularly near any body of water).

I started my healer journey by becoming a Sontre` Energy Healer in 2019 with Dr. Rich Fine and then continued by going back to school at the age of 40 to learn massage therapy, receiving my degree from Pinnacle Career Institute. I have continued my training further by receiving training to provide CranioSacral Therapy. Overcoming many traumas in my life I have learned that the body does indeed keep score. I believe the modalities the Divine Creator has guided me to learn and then practice is a part of my purpose that I am so grateful for and am finally stepping into and developing further. My goal for every patient is that they leave feeling there was an infinite amount of support, space holding, and divine love given in each session. I have a passion for helping others and find that my nurturing tendencies carry over into each session. I am continually inspired by the patients I treat and am committed to continue to learn, grow, and inspire those around me to do the same. My name is Nicole Brownell, and I am a Licensed Massage Therapist. I have always had a curiosity ... [ Read More ](#/staff_member/8/bio) Hi! My name is Dr. Chelsey. I'm so excited to be serving you as a Doctor of Chiropractic! Chiropractic is actually a second career for me (and the best)! I graduated from Graceland University in Lamoni, Iowa, then moved to the Kansas City area and started working in healthcare management. I always knew that I wanted to help people, but felt that something was missing and that I wasn't quite in my dream career. Making the choice to go back to school for chiropractic was one of the easiest decisions I've made and I love helping people through the Chiropractic paradigm! I believe our bodies are uniquely designed to function and heal from above-down, inside-out. Together we will address the physical, chemical, and emotional components that may be having adverse effects on your health. I am so very excited to work with you on our journey toward optimal well-being in mind, body, and spirit. Outside the office, I enjoy relaxing at home with my family, being outside in the sunshine, watching movies, and I love when I have the opportunity to take a good hot bath. I live in Raymore, Missouri with my husband, Chad, our boys Jayden and Logan, and our two dogs, Nahla and Neo. I look forward to getting to know you and to helping you achieve your wellness goals!

I'm a Kansas City native, I grew up right here in Olathe! I attended the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk!) in Lawrence, Kansas, and I earned my Bachelor of Science in Organismal Biology. I then packed my bags and moved to Davenport, Iowa to attend Palmer College of Chiropractic. It was there that I met my husband, Dr. Jamie Paquette, on our very first day of school. We have a 5-month-old son named Oliver, and two fur babies named Ozzy and Moon! I love being a chiropractor, and I love the opportunity to see my patients become the best version of themselves possible. My chiropractic specialty is pregnancy, pediatrics, and sports.

I utilize a variety of Chiropractic techniques including manual, full spine and extremity adjusting, Webster Technique, and instrument adjusting such as Activator method. Because I firmly believe that our bodies consist of mind, body, and spirit, I also practice the energy healing method, Reiki, to address emotional and spiritual needs.
