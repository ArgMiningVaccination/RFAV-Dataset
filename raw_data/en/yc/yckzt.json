The common ''one size ts all'' approach to treatment is neither optimal nor appropriatefor all patient subgroups. One such subgroup can be dened by the iden- tication of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNAin the squamous cell head and neck tumor. HPV-associated cancers tend to occur more fre- quently in younger, male patients, and mostfrequently in the oropharynx, a tumor subsite associated with the presence of HPV DNA in up to 60% of cases. Although these tumors areoften more poorly differentiated histologically, the patients appear to have a better prognosis after treatment than those whose head andneck cancers are not associated with HPV. Recognition of this HPV association amounts to the identication of a new disease,a disease with a rapid increase in incidence, and one that poses important challenges for the oncologic community. These challenges arenot limited to treatment, but also include early diagnosis, prevention, and public educa- tion. Lessons can be learned from our under-standing of the importance of HPV in cervical cancer. The potential for sexual transmission of HPV, and therefore of head and neck can-cer, and the impact of the recently available HPV vaccine have clear implications. Futurestudy design and data analysis should acknowledge the unique natural history andprognosis of this patient subgroup, and incor- porate HPV status into the next generation of clinical trials. To that end, a National Cancer Institute- sponsored State of the Science meeting on Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer and theHuman Papillomavirus was convened. On November 9-10, 2008, almost 80 investigators, largely drawn from the NCI Head and NeckSteering Committee and Task Forces, met in Washington, D.C. to focus on the epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of HPV-associ-ated squamous cell head and neck cancers. The objectives of this meeting were to review the basic science, epidemiology, and natural historyof HPV infection and HPV-associated squamous cell cancers. A review of completed and ongoing head and neck cancer clinical trials that haveseparately evaluated the HPV-positive subgroup as well as of the currently available diagnostic tools used to dene HPV-positivity wasplanned. The statistical and design issues im- portant in the development of future clinical trials based on HPV-status, and the publichealth implications of HPV-associated disease were explored. This monograph summarizes the proceedings of that meeting. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HPV-POSITIVE HEAD AND NECK CANCER Maura L. Gillison, MD, PhD Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center,Columbus, Ohio The International Agency for Research on Can- cer has concluded that human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is a cause of oropharyngeal cancer based upon a review of the epidemiologic evidence.1Critical epidemiologic associations expected for an HPV-caused cancer (eg, with sex-ual behavior and HPV exposure) have been reported in several case-control studies of oral cancer. 1-11Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the risk factors and cofactors for HPV-posi- tive and HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) are sufciently distinctfrom one another to conclude, together with clini- cal and molecular distinctions outlined else-where, that HPV-positive head and neck cancer is a distinct disease entity. Sexual Behavior. Natural history studies and case-control studies of cervical HPV infection and cancer have clearly established HPV as a sexually acquired infection. Lifetime number ofsexual partners is the principal risk factor for exposure to HPV, and several case-control stud- ies have reported elevated odds for oral cancer(ie, oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer) among individuals with a high number of sexual partners. 3,4,8Strong trends have been observed in particular between number of oral sex part- ners and odds of oropharyngeal cancer,3,4con- sistent with evidence for oral-genital contact asa principal means of acquiring oral HPV infec- tion. In case-case comparisons, the sexual behaviors of HPV-positive cases were signi-cantly different from those reported by HPV- 1394 State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009negative cases with regard to lifetime number of sexual partners, oral sex partners, and historyof oral-anal contact. 3,12Indeed, when stratied by HPV-tumor status, sexual behavior was asso- ciated with the risk of HPV-positive and notHPV-negative cancer. 3Therefore, sexual behav- ior has recently been appreciated as a risk fac- tor for head and neck cancer, but is restricted tothe HPV-positive form of the disease. HPV16 Exposure. The sexual behavioral associa- tions noted earlier have been observed to attenu- ate after adjustment for exposure to HPV asmeasured by serology, indicating that sexual behavior is a surrogate marker for HPV expo- sure. 13Although HPV16 seropositivity is strongly associated with head and neck cancer in numer- ous case-control studies (and on occasion HPV 35 and 33),3,4,10stratied analysis indicates strong associations (from /C244- to 180-fold) with oropha- ryngeal cancer and weak to null associations with cancers at other anatomic sites (eg, oral cavityand laryngeal cancers). 3,6,10,14Consistent with these odds ratios is the 14-fold increase in risk for oropharyngeal cancer observed in a nested casecontrol study in Scandinavia, which remains the only study to demonstrate that HPV16 exposure precedes development of disease. 2By contrast, HPV serology does not appear to be associated with HPV-negative head and neck cancers,3,14 arguing against a ''hit-and-run'' mechanism for HPV in these cancers. Oral HPV Infection. HPV is an epithelium-specic infection that does not disseminate though the bloodstream, so a limitation of HPV serology isthat it does not specify the anatomic site of HPV infection. Therefore, the elevated odds of oral can- cer observed in association with oral HPV infec-tion are considered more robust evidence for a direct relationship between infection and cancer. Numerous case-control studies have reported ele-vated odds (from /C242- to 200-fold) of oral and oro- pharyngeal cancer among individuals with a detectable oral HPV infection. 3,4,7,8,10,11High- risk, but not low-risk, oral HPV infection is con- sistently associated with head and neck cancer. Observed associations strengthen considerablywhen analysis is restricted to high-risk versus low-risk HPV types, HPV16 detection versus all high-risk HPV types, and type-specic HPV16detection versus multiplex detection. Similarly,associations strengthen when analysis is re- stricted to certain types of head and neck cancer,such that odds ratios for tonsillar cancer >oro- pharyngeal cancer >oral cancer >head and neck cancer. Oral HPV infection is not associated withHPV-negative oral cancers. 3,7Taken together, the data on risk associated with sexual behavior, HPV exposure, and oral HPV detection indicatethat sexually acquired oral HPV infection is the principal risk factor for this distinct form of head and neck cancer. Alcohol and Tobacco Exposure. The majority of head and neck cancers worldwide remain attrib- utable to tobacco and alcohol use, and whether these exposures interact with oral HPV infectionto further increase the risk of cancer remains a major topic of debate. Although early research suggested a possible synergy between exposure totobacco 8or alcohol7and HPV, subsequent work has found no evidence of interaction.3,6,13In fact, 2 case-control studies have observed no evidencethat tobacco or alcohol use affect risk for cancer among HPV-exposed individuals. 6,13Complicat- ing factors in these analyses, which may explainthese inconsistencies, include the combined anal- ysis of a variable mix of HPV-positive and HPV- negative head and neck cancers as well as imper-fect measures of HPV exposure. Seroconversion is not absolute among HPV-infected individuals, and cross-sectional detection of oral HPV infec-tion cannot adequately measure past exposure. HPV-Positive versus HPV-Negative Tumors. As has been done for clarication of the clinical characteristics and prognostic outcomes forHPV-positive versus HPV-negative cancers, stratication by tumor HPV status will be an important approach in clarifying risk factors, inthat associations may be in opposite directions and thus bias ndings toward the null. Further- more, it will be important in these analyses notto use surrogate markers for classication of tu- mor HPV status (such as HPV serology) because signicant misclassication may result. Strati-cation by tumor HPV status had been used in a single case-control study to compare the risk factors for HPV-positive and HPV-negative headand neck cancer. 3In this analysis, risk-factor proles were remarkably distinct. Strong trends were observed between measures of lifetime sex-ual behavior and marijuana use for HPV- State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1395positive cancers, whereas by contrast strong trends were observed between alcohol, tobacco,poor oral hygiene, and HPV-negative cancers. This study is the rst to suggest that cofactors (ie, marijuana for HPV-positive and oral hygienefor HPV-negative), in addition to the principal exposure measures, may differ for HPV-positive and -negative head and neck cancers. The distinctions in risk-factor proles for HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC may possibly extend dietary factors. In a recentlyreported case-control study, HPV16 serostatus appeared to modify the association between fruit consumption and head and neck cancer. 9Among HPV16 seronegative individuals, increasing ter- tiles of fruit intake were associated with decreased odds of HNSCC (as had been previ-ously observed), whereas odds increased with increasing intake among HPV16-seropositive individuals. These trends appeared stronger inan analysis restricted to pharyngeal cancer cases. However, in a case-case comparison, the elevated odds of HPV-DNA positive versusDNA-negative HNSCC one would expect in association with increased fruit consumption were not observed, consistent with an alternateexplanation of a differential effect of dietary fruit consumption on seroconversion among HPV exposed individuals. Oral Cavity and Laryngeal Cancer. Although, in the literature, HPV DNA has been detected in a large proportion of oral cavity and laryngeal cancers, whether HPV is etiologic for these can-cers remains unclear. Several studies have reported relatively weak (compared with those for oropharyngeal cancers) but signicant asso-ciations between HPV seropositivity or can- cers in stratied analysis. 2,6An international case-control study has estimated that HPV may play a role in approximately 3% of oral cavity cancers.5At this time, it is difcult to distin- guish between a cause-effect relationship and the possible role of anatomic misclassication of the primary tumor site as the explanation forthese ndings. Given the apparent proclivity of tonsillar tissue in the lateral- posterior tongue or floor of mouth, estimated to occur in 0.4 per 100,000 individuals, may be anadditional contributor to these ndings.

Despite the recognition that HPV is a strong risk factor for oropharyngeal cancers, there is wide variabilityin the reported proportion of cancers attribut-able to HPV infection, ranging from 12% to 63%. Based on a multicenter international case-con-trol study, Herrero et al 6reported that 18.3% of oropharyngeal cancers had evidence of detecta- ble HPV DNA in tumors. Using these estimates,and restricting to subjects who also had evi- dence of antibodies to HPV early Bray 2estimated that approximately 12% of oropharyngeal cancers worldwide are potentially attributable to HPV infection. In a systematic review of PCR-basedworldwide published literature, Kreimer et al 5 reported that 35.6% of oropharyngeal cancerswere HPV positive. In contrast, recent multicen-ter studies conducted in the United States indicate that a much higher proportion of oro- pharyngeal cancer ( /C2463%) is infection. 7Geographic differences in HPV exposures may, in part, contribute to this variability. For example, the systematicreview by Kreimer et al 5reported HPV-attribut- able proportions of 47% in North America, 46% in Asia, 36% in South/Central America, Aus-tralia, and Africa, and 26% in Europe. It is likely that the proportion of oropharyngeal can- cers that are attributable to HPV infection in aparticular region would be altered by the preva- lence of smoking and alcohol use and patterns of sexual behaviors. It is widely accepted thatan overwhelming majority (90% to 95%) of HPV- associated oropharyngeal cancers is attributable to HPV16, 5the genotype that is responsible for approximately 50% of all cervical cancers world- wide and targeted in currently available prophy- lactic HPV vaccines. Across the range of HPV attributable disease, current data suggest that between 6,000 to 33,000 oropharyngeal cancers worldwide and800 to 4,600 cancers in the United States are caused by HPV infection (Table 1). The Table 1. Estimated annual burden of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers in the United States and worldwide. HPV-attributable HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1397variability notwithstanding, these estimates indicate a signicant role for HPV as a cause ofhead and neck cancer. In fact, of all HPV-associ- ated cancers\u2014anus, cervix, oropharynx, penis, vagina, and vulva\u2014the cancers is second only to cer- vical cancer. 2,8In the United States, HPV- associated constitute asignicant fraction of all noncervical ated cancers among women (26%) and cers impose a signicant economic problem in the United States, with annual estimated costs ofapproximately $151 million (assuming U.S. $33,000 per case) toward treatment and disease management. 9 The import of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers may have increased substantially during recent calendar periods in the United States.10,11 According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, the incidence of head and neck cancer sitesthat are potentially related to HPV infection (oro- pharyngeal cancers; palatine tonsil, and pharynx) signi-cantly increased between 1973 and 2004, with an annual increase of 0.8%. 10Across the oropharyn- geal cancer subsites, incidence and tonsil cancers (lingual and palatine) increased signicantly from 1973 to 2004 (annual increases of 1.27% and 0.60%, respectively),whereas incidence of pharyngeal cancers was sta- ble. 10In contrast, incidence of head and neck can- cer anatomic sites that seem unrelated to HPVinfection (oral cavity cancers) declined signi- cantly during 1973-2004 at a rate of 1.85% per year. 10The increasing incidence for oropharyn- geal cancers was observed predominantly among white men (but not among women), at younger ages, and in cohorts born between 1925 and1940. 10Notably, there was an equalization of inci- dence rates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal can- cers in the year 2004 (3.2 per 100,000 person-years). Hence, the proportion of all head and neck cancers that are oropharyngeal in origin has increased dramatically, from 18% in 1973 to 31%in 2004. Analogous data are emerging from other regions of the world. For example, in Sweden, incidence of tonsil cancer increased from 1.3 per100,000 person-years in 1970 to 3.6 per 100,000 person-years in 2002. 12This increase was evident among both men and women (2.6-fold and 3.5-foldincreases, respectively). 12The declining incidence of oral cavity cancers may be explained by trends in tobacco and alco-hol use during recent calendar periods in the United States. 13However, the increasing inci- dence of oropharyngeal cancers among recentbirth cohorts suggests that exposure to oral HPV infection and, as a consequence, the pro- portion of oropharyngeal cancer that is causedby HPV infection have increased signicantly over time. Perhaps changes in sexual behaviors during the 1960s, including increasing practiceof premarital sex and increasing average num- ber of lifetime sex partners, have led to an increase in oral HPV exposure. 14Consistent with this hypothesis, Hammarstedt et al12 reported a 3-fold increase in the proportion ofHPV DNA-positive tonsillar cancers from the1970s to the 2000s in Sweden (23% during the 1970s and 68% during 2000s). In summary, recent studies show that the worldwide burden of HPV-associated head and neck cancers is considerable, and has been increasing dramatically over the past 2 decades.The recognition of HPV as an etiologic factor for oropharyngeal cancers provides a unique oppor- tunity for prevention, potentially through pro-phylactic HPV vaccination. 8 REFERENCES 1.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ORAL HPV INFECTION Gypsyamber D'Souza, PhD, MS, MPH Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School ofPublic Health, Baltimore, Maryland Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is newly appreciated as an important cause of oro-pharyngeal cancer. 1Despite this risk, the preva- lence and risk factors for oral HPV infection inthe general population have not been wellevaluated. There is no accepted standard for collection or processing of oral exfoliated cells to detectHPV infections related to head and neck cancer.Variation in DNA purication methods canaffect HPV detection, given that polymerasechain reaction (PCR) inhibitors in oral rinsesamples are now known to impair HPV detec-tion if DNA is inadequately puried. 2Subopti- mal DNA purication of oral exfoliated cells may cause misclassication of HPV status. In addition, other factors may also affect oral HPVdetection because it is unknown whether behav-iors such as having just eaten, chewed gum, orbrushed teeth might affect detection of HPVDNA in oral exfoliated cells. The best estimates of oral HPV prevalence come from population-based studies, which report 5% to 10%. 3,4The majority of HPV infections population-based studieswere of low-risk subtypes. Studies of hospital-ized patients without cancer (controls) havecomparable or slightly higher estimates of oral HPV prevalence (5% to 18%). In these older hos- pital-based controls, approximately half of oralHPV infections detected are high risk (3% to10% prevalence of oncogenic HPV types). Higheroral HPV prevalence has been reported in select populations, including 21% to 37% among women with genital HPV infection, and 20% to37% among those infected with human immuno-deciency virus (HIV).The prevalence of oral HPV infection among young adults has not been well evaluated. A recent study of 1235 children and adolescents reported an overall HPV prevalence of 1.9% inyouth, with increasing HPV prevalence as chil-dren aged from 1- to 3.3%in 16- to 20-year-olds. 5Although genital HPV prevalence usually peaks around age of maximalsexual risk-taking (20s) and then decreases with age, initial studies suggest that oral HPV preva- lence may continue to increase with increasingage among adults. 6,7The pattern of increasing oral HPV prevalence with increasing adult ageis unusual for a sexually transmitted infection. Long-term natural history studies of oral HPV infection have not yet been reported. Although the natural history of cervical HPV infection is well established, it is unclear whether the courseof HPV in the oral cavity and oropharynx, which have a distinct immunologic environment, will be similar. One study that collected both oral and cervical samples from the same women reported comparable clearance rates for prevalent oral andcervical HPV infections after 6 months, but this work was limited by short follow-up and small number of HIV-negative participants. 7The rate of newly detected oral HPV infection was lower than that observed for cervical HPV infection in that report. Another prospective study tested pregnant women and their partners for oral HPV every 6 months for 3 years. In this study, 10% ofthose with no oral HPV infection at baseline had an incident HPV infection detected within 2 years. 8Type-specic oral HPV clearance was not reported in this study, but among those who were positive for at least 1 type of oral HPV at base- line, none of the men and only 5% of the women became HPV-negative (ie, cleared all their HPV infections) within 2 years. This suggests the nat-ural history of oral HPV infection might differ from that known in the cervix. Long-term natu- ral history studies of type-specic oral HPV infec-tion are needed to evaluate the incidence and time to clearance of oral HPV infection as well as potential risk factors. State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1399Only a few studies have evaluated factors associated with oral HPV infection. Oral HPVinfection is believed to be sexually acquired and oral HPV prevalence is signicantly associated with number of recent oral sexual partners ininitial studies. 6,9As sexual behaviors are corre- lated, prospective studies are needed to ascer- tain which behaviors are involved in oral HPVtransmission and the level of risk associated with these behaviors. Increased risk of persis- tent high-risk oral HPV infection was associatedwith persistent oral HPV infection of spouses in another study, 8supporting sexual transmission of the virus. Oral HPV prevalence has also been associ- ated with male gender,6increasing age,6,7and current tobacco use.5,7,9Further research is needed to evaluate whether the observed associ- ations may be explained by residual confound- ing arising from differences in sexual behavioror how these factors may affect oral HPV natu- ral history. HPV infection at each anatomic site is local- ized and concordance of oral and genital HPV infection is low. 7However, women with genital HPV infection do have higher odds of oral HPVinfection 10,11than women without concomitant genital HPV infection. This could be explained by infection at multiple sites from the sameinfected partner (example: exposure of a penile HPV infection to the oral cavity during oral sex and to the cervix during vaginal sex with thesame partner). There is currently no evidence to support autoinoculation of an HPV infection from one site to another site on the body,although this possibility cannot be excluded. Individuals with human immunodeciency infection (HIV) are at increased risk for oralHPV infection. Oral HPV prevalence is higher in HIV-positive than that in HIV-negative indi- viduals 6,7and increases with severity of HIV- related immunosuppression.6,7In addition, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use does not appear to decrease oral HPVpersistence. 7Increased prevalence of oral HPV in HIV-infected individuals could be explained by increased oral HPV infection when exposed,longer time to clearance, and/ or increased reex- pression of latent infections in immunosup-pressed individuals. In summary, initial research suggests that oral HPV infection is sexually transmitted andis common among adolescents ( /C243%) and adults (5% to 10%). Further research on the natural history, risk factors, and vaccine efcacy for oralHPV infection is needed. REFERENCES 1. D'Souza G, Kreimer AR, Viscidi R, et al.

Gravitt, MS, PhD Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Schoolof Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland Methods for the detection of human papillomavi- rus (HPV) DNA have evolved over time sinceHPV was rst postulated as a cause of cervical cancer in the 1980s. As the sensitivity, specic- ity, and spectrum of HPV types detected withthese methods increased, so too did estimates of the proportion of cervical cancers caused by HPV. These increased from 30% to 60% to >99% with the use of current, broad-spectrum polyer- mase chain reaction (PCR) methods, thus high- lighting the importance of the quality of HPVexposure measurements on ultimate clinical and scientic inference. 1HPV detection methods changed to accommodate the aims of investiga-tion, from conrming the association with can- cer in case-control studies, to screening applications, natural history studies, andstudies of HPV prophylactic vaccine efcacy.Currently, a variety of methods are available for the detection of HPV DNA, each with particularstrengths and limitations (Table 2). The aims of the investigation should determine the appropri- ate choice of method used. Several other factors, in addition to HPV detection methodology, may affect HPV detec-tion results. 2The type and quality of the sample used for HPV testing is of paramount impor-tance. HPV infects the basal cells of stratied squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and the anogenital tract of both men and women. Thereis no blood-borne phase of HPV infection, andthus epithelial samples are required for deni-tive diagnosis. Two types of epithelial samples are generally available: exfoliated epithelial cells or tissue biopsy samples. For oral HPVdetection, exfoliated cells are collected by directswab sampling or by collection of saliva or oralrinse specimens. In general, the most sensitive method for detection of HPV infection in the oral cavity is the oral rinse, likely because ofthe larger epithelial area sampled. 3By this method, the HPV detected is present insloughed epithelial cells. It is possible that infec- tions restricted to the tonsillar crypt epithelium or the basal cell layer may not be detectable. Table 2. Methods for the detection of HPV in oral specimens.

Equally important to HPV detection and sampling methodology is the method used for processing and storage of both exfoliated oral epithelial cells and tissue biopsies or surgicaltissue samples. For the former, use of SCOPE mouthwash is recommended because it is a vali- dated collection medium that is highly accepta-ble to the sample donor. 4A variety of methods are available for the preparation of exfoliated epithelial cells. In general, DNA can beextracted directly from the oral rinse specimen following protein digestion. A protocol based on the PureGene purication kit has been vali-dated. 4It is important to note that characteris- tics unique to the oral sample require modications to the manufacturer's instructionto result in optimal DNA yield and purity. Alter- native commercial DNA purication kits are likely to be equally useful, although optimiza-tion using appropriate controls and parallel comparison with validated protocols is critical for comparability across studies. If tissue sam-ples are to be collected and stored for HPV test- ing, the preferred storage condition is snap freezing the specimen in liquid nitrogen withpermanent storage at /C080 /C14C. If the sample is to be xed, use of standard 10% buffered formalin will generally preserve the HPV DNA, althoughdegradation is common and highly variable and should influence considerably the choice of HPV detection assays (see Figure 1). Processing oftissue specimens generally requires more rigor- ous purication, usually involving longer diges- tion times and organic extraction to maximizeboth DNA yield and purity. Serum antibodies are the only systemic marker of HPV infection and may have limitedutility. Antibodies to early (E6/E7) viral oncopro- teins are often detectable in cancer patients, and may therefore be useful as a specic prog-nostic marker of HPV-associated tumors. 5Se- rum antibodies to late proteins (L1) are insensitive markers of cumulative exposure, andhave little diagnostic value. When used in epide- miologic studies of head and neck cancer risk, they can serve as a reasonable marker of HPVexposure; however, extreme caution should beused when interpreting the results because sero- logic measures of L1 antibody represent cumula-tive exposure to all sites (including the common anogenital infections in men and women) and therefore lack specicity to the oral cavity. As noted previously, the ultimate choice of HPV detection assay among the many available systems is dependent on how the HPV informa-tion is to be used. The study of the natural his- tory of HPV infection in the oral cavity requires noninvasive sampling and an agnosticapproach to the HPV genotype predicted to be present. At present, target amplication (eg, PCR) methods are most frequently used forthis purpose, as reviewed in Gravitt et al. 2 These methods are based on amplication ofHPV using type-specic or broad spectrumprimer sets. Type-specic PCR methods target a single HPV genotype per test. Thus, if study aims are targeted to specic genotypes only(eg, tracking vaccine-associated HPV infection), FIGURE 1 of 3 commonly used consensus PCR sys- broad spectrum HPV genotyping: ( A) SPF10 primers are indicated in red. This system is based on a pool of 10 pri- mers and generates a nearly 62-basepair (bp) fragment and is therefore particularly favored for amplication of highlydegraded DNA samples, such as those extracted from formalin- xed, parafn-embedded tissue sections. ( B) GP5 \u00fe/6\u00feprimers are indicated in gold. This system is based on a single upstream and downstream primer pair and generates a nearly 150-bp product. Type-specic sequence variation in the primerbinding region is accommodated by inclusion of degenerate or permissive nucleotides. This system may underestimate type- specic prevalence when multiple genotype infections are com- mon. ( C) (PG)MY09/11 primers are indicated in blue. The PGMY09/11 system is based on a pool of 18 primers andamplies an approximately 450-bp product. The MY09/11 ver- sion is based on degenerate primers (see GP5 \u00fe/6\u00fe) and has similar limitations in detection of multiple infections. The long product length may preclude amplication from highly degraded DNA samples. A comparison of genotype spectrum detected bythese systems is found in Gravitt et al. 2[Color gure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www. interscience.wiley.com.] 1402 State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009these methods are perfectly suitable. General, or consensus, primer PCR methods rely onpools of primers that are generally targeted to the conserved L1 open reading frame. Three commonly used and validated consensus PCRsystems are shown in Figure 1. Using these methods, several HPV types can be amplied in a single test. Therefore, if assessment of thepresence of one or more HPV types is the aim of the investigation, use of these primer sys- tems is most efcient. Although each of the general or consensus primer systems represents a reasonable method for detection of any high-risk HPV, subtle differ-ences may affect results. The efciency of ampli- cation for any HPV type by consensus primer sets is a function of PCR product size, thehomology of the consensus primers to each indi- vidual HPV type, and the extent of nonspecic background amplication. All 3 methods targeta similar spectrum of HPV genotypes. 2However, the type-specic sensitivity primer systems (eg, GP5 \u00fe/6\u00fe) will have greater heterogeneity in type-specic sensitivity when compared with consensus primer pools (eg, SPF10 and PGMY09/11). Thismay have a greater impact in the presence of multiple-type HPV infection. HPV types in molar excess with better primer matches in theprimer-binding regions may out-compete types with more mismatches, resulting in false-nega- tive results. Such an impact will depend on theprevalence of multiple infections in the popula- tion. Initial studies indicate less of a problem in oral than cervical samples in immunocompetentpopulations. The impact of the different PCR product length is critical when testing DNA extracted from parafn tissues, in that xed tis-sues are highly susceptible to DNA degradation. In this case, the smaller the product sizes, the better. The SPF10 system is preferred for thedetection of HPV from xed tissues. Many methods are available for the detec- tion of PCR projects, and have been reviewedelsewhere. 6In general, a second type-specic probe hybridization is achieve maxi- mum sensitivity; classication of HPV statusbased solely on the presence or absence of the expected fragment size on an ethidium bromide gel is not only insensitive, but in the case ofconsensus primer PCR, relatively nonspecic and should be avoided. auto- mated platforms such as chip- or bead-basedarrays. Because each probe used must be quality controlled and validated with each new lot for optimal performance, use of commercial-ized assays with standardized protocols is recommended. If the aim of the testing is for diagnostic or prognostic purposes (eg, dening HPV-associ- ated tumors), the best methods will localize the genome of high-risk HPV to the tumor cellnuclei and/or demonstrate expression of viral oncogenes (eg, E6/E7 mRNA). 7Methods avail- able hybrid-ization, 8p16 immunohistochemistry,8and PCR quantitation of viral DNA or RNA in microdis- sected tumor tissue.9Although the latter may be the ''gold standard'' for etiological use, it has limited clinical utility. Studies that can be performed on parafn-embedded tissues wouldbe preferred. In situ methods are generally type-specic, and therefore require hybridiza- tion with multiple probes to get consensus gen-otyping information. However, since the majority ( /C2490% to 95%) of head and neck can- cers are attributed to HPV16, and to a lesserextent to HPV16-related types (eg, types 31, 33, 35), the limitations thus posed are not as severe as in the case of cervical cancer. Strongstaining of tumor cells with p16 antibody is a marker of HR-HPV E7 expression (resulting from loss of pRB-mediated negative regula-tion), 10and is therefore a good consensus marker of HR-HPV infection. Use of these methods that demonstrate specicity of the sig-nal to tumor cells allows one to distinguish between etiologically relevant HPV detection (clonal presence in all tumor cells) and passen-ger virus or contamination (low copy detection in only a very few cells). 7 REFERENCES 1.

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF HPV-ASSOCIATED HEAD AND NECK SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA. II.IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION William Westra, MD Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland In recent years, the human papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as an important driving force behind the escalating incidence of oropha-ryngeal cancer, and its detection in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) now serves as a highly relevant biomarker. 1As a bio- marker, HPV detection serves a far more com- prehensive role than mere prognostication. HPV detection is emerging as a valid method of dis-cerning the presence and progress of disease encompassing all aspects of patient care from early cancer detection, to more accurate tumorstaging (eg, localizing site of tumor origin), to the selection of those patients most likely to benet from specic therapies, to posttreatmenttumor surveillance. There has seldom been a greater need for establishing a strategy of bio- marker detection that is accurate and faultlesslyreproducible from one diagnostic laboratory to the next. The Diagnostic Language of HPV-Related Head and Neck Cancers. The importance of standardiza- tion is not limited to detection methodologies. For HPV-positive head and neck squamous cellcancers, diagnostic language is in great need of a uniform vocabulary that draws attention to its relationship with HPV and yet avoids confusionwith more aggressive non-HPV-related cancers. 2 Two microscopic features of HPV-related cancersof the oropharynx have contributed to the dif-culty in achieving diagnostic clarity.First, HPV-related HNSCC is customarily misperceived as a poorly differentiated carci- noma based on the immature appearance of thetumor cells: they are made up of malignant cells that have a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and exhibit little if any keratinization. Althoughthis microscopic appearance departs from that of the nonneoplastic squamous epithelium that lines the oral cavity, it does closely emulate theappearance of the reticulated epithelium\u2014the specialized epithelium lining the tonsillar other words, HPV-related oropharyngeal can- cers are in fact highly differentiated, not poorly differentiated (as so widely assumed). Second, HPV-related HNSCCs are often aptly described as ''basaloid'' based on the lobular growth of cells with dense hyperchromatic nucleiand a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. As a diag- nostic modier, however, the term ''basaloid'' is confusing because it invites an erroneous connec-tion with basaloid squamous cell carcinoma\u2014a subtype of HNSCC notorious for its aggressive clinical behavior. A recent study has shown thatthe ''basaloid'' subtype is, in fact, composed of a mixed group of HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers that widely diverge with respect to clinicalbehavior. 2Specically, the presence of HPV is a favorable prognostic factor that can be used to identify a subtype of basaloid squamous cell carci-nomas that does not show the highly aggressive behavior usually associated with this variant. Given this divergence in clinical behavior, patholo-gists should develop nomenclature that avoids confusing our clinical colleagues. Until consensus panels put forward a classication scheme for oro-pharyngeal carcinomas that underscores their relationship with HPV, while avoiding confusion with the aggressive basaloid variant, it is our prac-tice to: (1) classify these tumors as nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, (2) suspend the use of the descriptors such as ''poorly differentiated'' and 1404 State HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009''basaloid,'' and (3) routinely report on the HPV status of all HNSCC arising in the oropharynx. Methods of HPV Detection. Although there is a growing consensus for routine HPV testing of all oropharyngeal carcinomas, the optimal method for HPV detection may prove a morecontentious matter. A variety of methods are in current use, ranging from consensus and type- specic polymerase chain reaction viral hybridization (ISH), detection serum antibodies Standardization of HPV detection in the clinicalarena must begin with selection of the best detection platform for universal application. This selection process will be influenced by a va-riety of concerns relating to sensitivity, specic- ity, reproducibility, cost, and feasibility. PCR-Based Detection versus In Situ Hybridiza- tion. The preferential use of ISH methods over PCR-based methods is supported both by biolog-ical and practical considerations. The reported large variation of HPV prevalence in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (0% to 100%!) islargely a reflection of the inability of nonquanti- tative PCR methods to discern virus that is bio- logically meaningful from virus that isbiologically irrelevant. In contrast, punctuate hybridization signals within the nuclei of tumor cells is a pattern of staining seen only followingHPV DNA integration into the host genome, and is thus more closely linked with relevant vi- ral infections. 3The presence of punctuate nu- clear hybridization signal abrogates the need for tran- scriptionally active HPV (eg, the improved specicity of HPV detection by ISH does not come at the expense of sensitivity. Theintroduction of various signal amplication steps has signicantly improved the sensitivity of this technique, even to the point of viraldetection down to one viral copy per cell. 3 Compared with PCR-based methods, ISH is a more practical tool for detecting HPV. The de-velopment of nonfluorescent chromogens now allows display of DNA hybridization using con- ventional light microscope. Adaptation of ISHto formalin-xed and parafn-embedded tissueshas made this technique compatible with stand- ard tissue-processing procedures and amenableto retrospective analysis of archival tissue blocks, whereas most PCR-based methods are optimized in fresh-frozen samples. With thesetechnical adaptations, ISH is a feasible and cost-effective test for most diagnostic laborato- ries that routinely process formalin-xed andparafn-embedded tissue blocks. versus In Situ HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas, transcription of the viral oncoproteinE7 is known to functionally inactivate the retino- blastoma (Rb) gene product, causing a perturba- tion of other key components of the Rb pathway.As one example, functional inactivation of Rb by E7 is known to induce an up-regulation of p16 expression, reaching levels that can be readilydetected by routine immunohistochemistry. Accordingly, p16 immunohistochemistry is often advocated as a reliable surrogate marker of HPV-induced neoplasia of oropharynx. 4 Direct comparison of p16 staining and HPV-16 ISH for large numbersof HNSCCs reveals a discrepancy rate of about 25%. The discrepancies consistently involve can- cers that are negative by HPV16 ISH but p16positive by immunohistochemistry. In a subset of discrepant cases (about 45%), high p16 expression is attributed to the presence of someother (non-16) HPV type, as conrmed by wide spectrum ISH. The remaining discrepancies likely reflect the imperfection of p16 as a are not related to HPV infection (eg, breast, lung, and skin). Using E6/E7 mRNA levels as conclusive evidence of HPV involvement, positive p16 immunostaining of HNSCCs only 79% spe-cic. 5Clearly, an HPV detection strategy is needed that combines the sensitivity of p16 immunohistochemistry with the specicity ofHPV-16 ISH. A Standardized Algorithm for Reliable Detection of HPV in Oropharyngeal Carcinoma. The limita- tions of any single detection assay may be offset using algorithms that combine the strengths ofcomplementary assays. We use a detection strat- egy that combines ISH with p16 immuno- histochemistry. Use of p16 immunostaining as asurrogate marker is enhanced by its ease of State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI stand- haveplagued most other immunohistochemical assays (eg, p53) are minimized by the binomial (rather than graded) distribution of staining:depending on HPV status, p16 staining is either absent or diffusely positive (ie, on or off). Given a sensitivity that approaches 100%, p16 immu-nostaining is a good rst-line assay for eliminat- ing HPV-negative cases from any additional analysis. HPV-16 ISH can be run concurrentlywith p16 immunostaining or as a second-line assay following a positive p16 result. Given a specicity approaching 100%, a positive HPV-16ISH reduces the numbers of false-positive cases by p16 staining alone. A p16-positive/HPV-16- negative result singles out a subset of tumorsthat qualify for rigorous analysis for other (ie, non-16) oncogenic HPV types. For this third-line assay, we use a consensus ISH probe thatdetects an extended panel of HPV types (ie, 15 different types). Others have advocated PCR- based methods for the detection of transcription-ally active virus. Whatever the method for this third-line assay, the upfront use of p16 immuno- staining and HPV-16 ISH accurately establishesthe HPV status of the vast majority of oropha- ryngeal cancers. Although some cases may require a more extended analysis, this algorithmminimizes expenditure of resources by preselect- ing those cases.P16 immunohistochemistry and HPV ISH are standardized techniques that are easilyapplied to formalin-xed and parafn-embedded tissues. Test turnaround time is relatively fast\u2014 no more than 2 days for diagnostic labs thatoffer high throughput services. As automated ISH technologies are brought on-line, turn- around time will be further shortened andstandardization across various diagnostic labo- ratories will be enhanced. REFERENCES 1.

Amanda Psyrri, MD Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut Human papillomavirus (HPV) is nearly ubiqui- tously present in humans, but only a small frac-tion of infected individuals develop cancer. Besides cervical cancer, the most widely accepted HPV-associated malignancy, HPV is implicated inthe pathogenesis of a subset of oropharyngeal cancers. Molecular markers provide a potential tool to identify the at-risk subpopulation and thepresence of early-stage cancers. These molecular markers must therefore be able to distinguish ordinary infections per se from infections thatcontribute to the development of cancer. In addi- tion, biomarkers that distinguish HPV-positiveversus HPV-negative head and neck cancers areneeded. The detection of HPV DNA in tumors perse does not prove causal association. This reviewfocuses on these molecular markers and theirrole in the diagnosis and management of oropha-ryngeal cancer. According to the molecular progression model for tobacco-associated head and neck cancers, 1abrogation of p53 and retin- oblastoma (pRb) tumor-suppressor pathways occurs mutational inactivation of p53 gene and down-regulation of p16 protein, respectively. The molecular events in HPV- induced carcinogenesis lead to functional abro-gation of p53 and pRb pathways that is medi- ated through the expression of the main viral 1406 State of the Science: HNSCC and 10.1002/hed November 2009oncoproteins E6 and E7, respectively. Disruption of the expression of the main viral transcription/replication factor E2, following viral DNA inte- gration, leads to unconstrained expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. The E6 and E7 genes ofoncogenic HPVs encode oncoproteins that bind and degrade p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressors, respectively. Most HPV-associatedcarcinomas harbor wild-type p53and Rbtumor- suppressor genes. Thus, the tumor-suppressor pathways are intact but dormant in these cellsbecause of the continuous expression of E6and E7oncogenes. HPV-associated cancers are asso- ciated with low levels. pRb is a neg-ative regulator of p16 protein at the transcriptional level. Therefore, low pRb levels lead to subsequent p16 up-regulation. Overex-pression of p16 protein has been repeatedly found in HPV-associated cancers. The p16 pro- tein functions as a tumor suppressor mainly bybinding to the cyclin D1 CDK4/CDK6 complex, preventing phosphorylation of the Rb protein. We sought to determine the prevalence of biologically relevant human papillomavirus (HPV) in OSCC denes HPV-induced tumors with favorable prognosis. We studied a cohort of 107 oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers forHPV-16 DNA viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, we con- structed a tissue microarray composed of thesetumors and studied expression of p53, pRb, and p16 proteins using a quantitative in situ method of protein analysis (AQUA). Our resultsdelineated 3 biologically and clinically distinct classes of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers based on HPV DNA determination and p16expression status: 1 class of HPV class of HPV positive/ p16 nonexpressing (class II), and 1 class HPVpositive/p16 expressing (class III) oropharyngeal tumors. Overall survival in class III was 79% compared with the other 2 classes (20% and18%, p\u00bc.0095). Disease-free survival for the and 13% 45% and 74% ( p\u00bc.03). Only patients in class III had signicantly lower p53 and pRb expression ( p\u00bc.017 and tively). Multivariable con- rmed the prognostic value of the 3-class model. We were able to show that only the HPV posi-tive/p16 expressing tumors t the cervical carci-nogenesis model and they are the ones associated with favorable prognosis. 2 P16 has also been identied as a useful bio- marker for HPV\u00fehead and neck cancer by other investigators. Strati et al3generated a mouse model for HPV-associated head and neck squa- mous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC arising in these HPV-16 transgenic mice shared similarmolecular histopathological characteristics with human HNSCC nonkeratiniz- ing histology. authors also identied mini- chromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7) asa potentially useful biomarker for HPV-positive head and neck cancer. Smeets et al 4sought to nd a detection algo- rithm for a biologically and clinically meaning- ful HPV infection. The authors considered HPV E6 oncogene expression in frozen biopsies as astandard for a meaningful HPV infection and they evaluated the value of the following assays on formalin-xed parafn embedded primer viral fluorescent p16 immunostaining, and on corresponding serumsamples detection of antibodies against the HPV16 proteins L1, E6, and E7. The most suita- ble algorithm with 100% sensitivity and appeared to p16 immunostaining followed by GP5 \u00fe/6\u00fePCR on the p16-positive cases. Taken together, p16 protein status can be usedas a surrogate marker for a biologically and clinically meaningful HPV infection in FFPE oropharyngeal tumor specimens. Several investigators used cDNA microarray technology as a tool to identify differences in biomarker expression between HPV \u00feand HPV/C0 cancers. Slebos et al5analyzed 36 head and neck squamous cell cancers using Affymetrix Human 133U Plus 2.0 GeneChip and for HPVby One proling of 84 HNSCCs,cervical cancers, and site-matched normal State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 samples. HPV and genotype were determined by hybridization to 70-meroligonucleotide microarrays containing probes for all 37 known mucosotropic HPV genotypes. HPV\u00feHNSCCs and cervical cancers were characterized by overexpression of a larger subset of cell cycle regulators than those observed in HPV /C0HNSCC. The authors noted that the majority of the hallmark differences between HPV \u00fehead and neck cancer and HPV/C0head and neck cancer, including testis- specic gene expression that are normally expressed only in meiotic cells, were a direct consequence of the viral E6 and E7 oncogeneexpression. We sought to identify biomarkers that distin- guish our class III oropharyngeal cancers fromthe other 2 classes. 2We hypothesized that since HPV16 \u00fe/p16-expressing tumors represent a dis- tinct molecular and clinical entity, they shouldharbor distinct protein expression proles. Our target biomarkers included proteins with well- described roles in cell cycle regulation, angio-genesis, and metastasis. We used AQUA on an oropharyngeal cancer tissue microarray, which allows quantitation and subcellular localization.We found that the of epidermal factor (EGFR), vascular endo- thelial HPV16 \u00fe/p16\u00fe tumors. 7Using the 3-class model, was signicant difference p16 ( p<.001), p53 (p\u00bc.026), and Rb ( p\u00bc.001) groups. For b-catenin was a sig- nicant difference by ANOVA ( p\u00bc.009), with post hoc analysis demonstrating this to be ascribed to class III tumors having elevated expression compared with class II tumors ( p\u00bc .001). For EGFR and VEGF, there were signi- cant differences between groups ( p\u00bc.009 and p\u00bc.028, respectively). For p14 and Erk2, there was a trend toward difference between groups, although this did not reach statistical signi- cance ( p\u00bc.054 and p\u00bc.074). We then sought over- expression of EGFR, VEGF, and b-catenin in HPV16\u00feHNSCC is a direct consequence of viral E6 and E7 protein expression. We used the HPV16\u00feoropharyngeal cancer cell lines 147T and 090, the HPV-negative cell line 40T, and thecervical cell lines SiHa (bearing integrated HPV16) and HeLa (bearing integrated HPV18) to measure VEGF, EGFR, as well as the cyto-plasmic and nuclear b-catenin levels before andafter E6/E7 gene silencing. To repress HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes in head and neck cell lines and the E2 repression system in HeLa. Introduction ofthe bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E2 gene into HeLa cells represses viral oncogene expression, resulting in activation of the p53 and Rb path-ways and cellular growth arrest. Infection of 147T and 090 cells with retroviral constructs resulted in severalfold inhibition of viral E6/E7mRNA, in restoration of p53 and pRB protein expression and substantial apoptosis. 8Repres- sion of HPV E6 and E7 genes signi-cant reduction in nuclear b-catenin levels. b- Catenin plays a dual role in carcinogenesis. It binds to the cytoplasmic domain of type I cad-herins and functions as a component of cad- herin-catenin adhesion system. b-Catenin is also the nuclear effector of Wnt signaling path-way. Wnt signaling determines the abundance of nuclear b-catenin. The accumulation of cyto- plasmic (signaling) b-catenin leads to its nuclear localization, where it binds to the T-cell factor/ lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and induces expression oftarget genes. We showed that the principal HPV oncoproteins (E6 and E7) are involved in b-cate- nin nuclear accumulation and repression of E6/E7 gene expression leads to down-regulation of nuclear b-catenin. Therefore, nuclear accumula- tion of b-catenin is a direct consequence of E6 and E7 expression. The possibility that nuclear b-catenin is a biomarker of HPV-positive oropha- ryngeal lesions likely to progress to cancershould be explored. In summary, the ordered expression of viral gene products can lead to overexpression of mul-tiple molecular proteins or biomarkers. These novel biomarkers may allow the monitoring of essential molecular events in histological orcytological specimens and are likely to improve the detection of lesions that have a high risk of progression in both primary screening and tri-age settings.

Martin Kast, PhD University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of cervi- cal epithelium is linked to the generation of cer- vical cancer. Although most women infectedwith HPV clear their lesions, the long latency period from infection to resolution indicates that HPV evolved immune escape mechanisms. Den-dritic cells (which are targeted by vaccinationprocedures) incubated with HPV virus-like par- ticles induce an HPV-specic response. Langerhans cells (LCs), which are located at thesites of primary infection, do not induce a response, implicating the targeting of LC as an immune escape mechanism used by HPV. PI3-K in LC denes novelescape mechanism used by HPV, and PI3-K in- hibition may serve as an effective clinical target to enhance HPV immunity. 1 As an alternative to targeting the PI3-K tar- geting, we also explored other Demonstrating that Toll-likereceptor 7 (TLR7) and are expressed on human LC, we hypothesized that imidazoquino- lines would activate LC infected with HPV16,leading to the induction of a HPV16-specic cell- mediated immune response. Surprisingly, both phenotypic and functional hallmarks of activa-tion are not observed when LCs are or resiquimodhighly markers, These data strongly indicate that 3M-002 and resiquimod are promising therapeutics for treat-ment of HPV infections and HPV-induced cervi- cal lesions. 2 To induce HPV-specic T-cell responses through the use of therapeutic vaccines, we explored the option that heterologous prime- boost regimens offer potential advantages overhomologous vaccine administration, including enhanced immune responses and lack of vector neutralization by host antibodies. Therefore,HPV vaccines based on Venezuelan equine en- cephalitis virus replicon particles (VRPs) and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)vectors, both expressing mutated E7/E6 fusion proteins from HPV16 or HPV18, were tested in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regi-mens in mice to assess antitumor immunity and in Rhesus macaques to assess levels of immuno- genicity in primates. Both VRP/VRP and VSV/VSV immunization elicited strong antigen-spe- cic T-cell responses in mice as assessed by interferon (IFN)- cELISPOT, although responses after VRP/VSV heterologous vaccination were signicantly higher. Antitumor immunity was assessed by prophylactic and therapeutic vacci-nation in mice against HPV16-transformed tumors. Full protection from tumor challenge was observed after immunization with VRP/ State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV with 80% to 100% rejection Macaqueswere primed with 3 inoculations of VRP at 0, 4, and 16 weeks, or with 2 inoculations of VSV at 0 and 8 weeks. Following each priming series, T-cell responses measured by IFN- cELISPOT to E6 and E7 peptides were low, but detectable. At 21 weeks following the priming series, macaqueswere immunized with the heterologous vaccine. ically induced cresponses that were at least 10-fold greater than postprimingresponses. In conclusion, the strong in vivo anti- tumor responses in mice and the robust T-cell responses in nonhuman primates after heterol-ogous VRP prime/VSV boost immunization pro- vide strong justication for further development of these vectors as therapeutic vaccines forHPV-associated disease. Despite the fact that HPV specic T-cells can potentially be induced by the TLR It is known that lymphotoxin- beta receptor (LTBR) signaling plays an impor-tant role in the formation of lymphoid struc- tures, where T-cells are more effectively primed. for LTBR and herpes virusentry /C0//C0mice, lymph- oid-like tissues inside tumor sites via its interac-tions with LTBR on stromal cells and recruits na\u00a8ve T-cells into the tumor. LIGHT coordinately induces activation and expansion of incomingT-cells through HVEM, thereby generating stronger anti-tumor immunity. We hypothesized that intratumoral therapy with recombinant ad-enovirus carrying LIGHT (Ad-LIGHT) induces tumor-specic T-cell responses in vivo, which can eradicate well-established HPV-inducedtumors in mice. To test therapeutic efcacy of Ad-LIGHT in an HPV16-induced mouse tumormodel, B6 mice were challenged with C3 tumors and tumor growth was monitored. On day 14 and day 17 after tumor challenge, Ad-LIGHT orAd-Control particles were injected intratumor- ally at 10 10virus particles per mouse. Tumors, lymph nodes, and spleens were harvested onday 27 to measure antigen-specic T-cell responses. Additional mice were maintained to monitor tumor growth and survival. Analysis ofthe spleens and lymph nodes with HPV16 E7(49-57) tetramers revealed that although none of Ad-LIGHT-treated mice weredirected against E7(49-57) and secreted IFN- c. Consistently, tumor growth correlated inversely with the number of functional tumor-specic T-cells. Our data show that Ad-LIGHT therapy can induce functional tumor-specic T-cells within the tumor tissue and this correlatesinversely with tumor growth. In conclusion, our combined data set shows that HPV may serve as a therapeutic targetbecause there are opportunities to reverse a major T-cell immune escape mechanism of HPV that involves the targeting by the virus ofhuman LC. This reversal involves blocking the PI3-K pathway or the activation of the TLR8 pathway in LC. In addition HPV heterol- ogous specic T-cells canbe lead efciently into HPV induced lesions by the forced expression of LIGHT. REFERENCES 1.

Koutsky, PhD University of Washington, Seattle, Washington Two prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have received regulatory approval and are commercially available in many countries.These vaccines have the potential to substan-tially reduce HPV-related vaccine (Gardasil; Merck, White- house Station, NJ). components ofboth vaccines are noninfectious virus-like par-ticles (VLPs), which are synthesized to resemblethe outer capsid (shell) of the virus. Each VLP iscomposed of multiple copies of a single viral pro- tein (L1). Eukaryotic cells are used to transcribe and translate the HPV L1 gene into L1 proteinsthat upon contact with each other self-assembleinto VLPs. Whether L1 VLPs are manufacturedin eukaryotic cells or are from live virus, they arehighly immunogenic and capable of stimulating production of type-specic neutralizing antibod- ies that protect the host from reinfection HPV type. 1In addition to VLPs, the vac- cines also contain an adjuvant, which is a com-pound that enhances the immune response tospecic antigens. The adjuvant in the HPV4 vac- cine is aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (alum), and in the HPV2 vaccine it is aluminumhydroxide, 50 g 3-O-deacylated-4-monophos-phoryl lipid A (AS04). Both vaccines require 3intramuscular injections, with recommendedschedules of day 1, month 1 (HPV2) or month 2(HPV4), and month 6. Neither of the vaccines is therapeutic 2,3and thus neither is expected to al- ter the course of established vaccine-type HPVinfections, lesions, or cancers. Randomized controlled trials 2,4-7have demon- strated (with remarkable consistency) that VLP vaccines achieve high levels of prophy- lactic efcacy across geographically diverse female populations. In phase III trials of young womenwho were negative for vaccine-type HPV antibod- ies and DNA at baseline, the HPV4 vaccine pre- vented 95% of HPV16/18-related precancerouslesions of the uterine cervix, 2, 96% genital warts, and because 70% of cancers worldwide8and HPV-6 and HPV-11 cause at least 70% of Immunogenicity analyses show that over 99% ofvaccinees seroconvert and that 3 doses of vaccinestimulate levels of antibodies to vaccine-type HPVs that are higher than that reported for natu- ral infections. 4,5An antigen challenge study showed that young women who received a booster dose of HPV4 vaccine 4.5 years after completing the 3-dose regimen, developed antibody titers forall 4 vaccine-type HPVs that were higher than or equivalent to titers observed 1 month after com- pleting the initial series. 10These data are signi- cant because they indicate that the vaccine induces B-cell memory, a hallmark of vaccines that provide long-lasting immunity. A vaccine thatprovides durable protection is much more bene- cial than one that requires additional boosting years after the initial series is completed. In the efcacy trials, both vaccines were found to be generally well-tolerated, with the most common vaccine-related side effects beingpain and erythema at the site of injection. Nota- bly, the range and intensity of side effects were not more common among those with prior expo-sure to vaccine-type HPVs, and did not increase with each subsequent dose. 2,6,7In addition to safety data collected in the clinical trials, publichealth agencies throughout the world are moni- toring population-level safety as HPV immuni- zation programs become established in theircountries. For example, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ recs/acip/slides-oct08.htm#hpv) recently ana-lyzed safety data based on the administration of millions of HPV4 vaccine doses in the U.S. gen- eral population. These analyses also showed ahigh level of vaccine safety and moreover, did not support anecdotal concerns that HPV vacci- nation was associated with an increased risk ofGuillain-Barre \u00b4Syndrome, transverse myelitis, or death. Although results from clinical trials and population-level safety analyses are veryreassuring, the CDC and other vaccine surveil- lance groups will continue to monitor general population data to determine whether HPV vac-cination is associated with extremely rare or delayed adverse outcomes. Although the HPV2 vaccine has not yet been approved for use in theUnited States, data from a population-level State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1411vaccine program in the United Kingdom indi- cate that the safety proles of HPV2 and HPV4are similar. Both vaccines are contraindicated for individuals with hypersensitivity, including those with severe allergic reactions to activeand inactive ingredients included in the vaccine. Neither vaccine is currently recommended for pregnant women because there are insufcientsafety data for this population. Although the vaccine efcacy trials did not enroll girls <15 years of age, immunogenicity and safety studies that included girls and boys, 9 to 15 years of age, showed that over 99% sero- converted for all vaccine-types of HPV. The anti-body titers for these children were as high as or higher than observed in the immunogenicity studies of older adolescent females andwomen. 11,12Safety proles were also similar for children and young women. Thus, recommenda- tions for targeted vaccination of approximately9- to 13-year-old girls were based on data from these child-to-young adult bridging studies, as well as the knowledge that HPVs are acquiredprimarily through sexual contact (which on av- erage begins around age 16), and the observa- tion that HPV vaccination is most benecialwhen administered to those without vaccine- type HPV infections. The vaccine is approved for females 9 to 26 years of age in many countries,including the United States. Based on limited safety and immunogenicity data, some countries approved vaccine for females through 45 yearsof age and for boys (9 to 15 years of age). In summary, the HPV2 and HPV4 vaccines are generally safe and extremely effective inpreventing HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and HPV16/18-related precancerous cervical lesions. In clinical trials, HPV4 vaccine was also shownto prevent HPV6/11/16/18-related precancerous vulvar or vaginal lesions, and genital warts. Administration of vaccine before sexual debutmost likely provides maximal benet and cur- rently, 10- to 13-year-old females are the focus of HPV immunizations programs in many coun-tries. Although there are limited follow-up data on vaccinated cohorts, demonstration of durable protection throughout the course of the trials,and of immune memory with antigen challenge 4.5 years after the completion of the initial vac- cine series, supports longer-term protection.Only time will tell if the protection is suf- ciently durable to eliminate the need for routine boosting years after the initial vaccine series iscompleted. Several additional questions concern-ing the use of these vaccines in boys, older adults, and populations with a high burden ofHIV are being addressed in ongoing trials. Other issues related to implementation of im- munization programs, feasibility of 2 versus 3doses of vaccine, herd immunity, and cost are being evaluated in demonstration projects and mathematical models. Whether prophylacticadministration of HPV vaccine will prevent oro- pharyngeal HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections and the associated cancers remains to be determinedbut there is no reason to suspect that it will not.

Giuliano, PhD H. Lee Moftt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida There is increasing interest in understanding the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV)infection and disease among men. In earlier work, much of this interest focused on the role of men in the transmission of HPV to women,and its contribution to the propagation of cervi- cal cancer. Over the past several years there has been rapid development and now recogni-tion that HPV causes disease in men. 1,2In addi- tion, there is now evidence that the currently licensed HPV vaccine for females confers protec-tion against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 infection and external genital lesions (EGLs) in males ages 16 to 26 years. 3With vaccination, we have a strong prevention candidate for men, (pending regula- tory approval). However, we know little of the underlying natural history of infection and pro-gression to disease in men: such as the diversity of HPV types that cause EGLs, proportion of infection at a variety of anatomic sites that pro-gress to cancer, the rate of progression, and dif- ferences in the epidemiology across the lifespan. In addition, we know little of the biology of HPVinfections related to EGLs in men, such as viral load and integration status of different HPV types and types and grades of EGLs. This natu-ral history information is necessary to estimate the population effectiveness of deploying the quadrivalent vaccine to men, to inform futuregeneration vaccine development (expansion of HPV types included in vaccine), and to inform development of improved, and novel strategiesof infection and disease prevention in men, interventions that may ultimately impact dis- ease burden in men as well as women. HPV Infection-Related Disease in Men. HPV infection causes cancerous and noncancerous lesions in men. Several cancers of the anogenital tract and upper aerodigestive tract, and theirprecursor lesions in men are now known to be caused by infection with the sexually transmit- ted HPV. 1Worldwide approximately 85% of anal cancer cases are attributable to this infection. Approximately 50% of cancers of the penis, 33% to 72% of oropharyngeal cancers, and 10% ofcancers of the larynx are attributable to HPVinfection. 1There is a growing body of literature focused on anal precancerous lesions in highrisk male populations. In contrast, relatively lit- tle information has been published focused on HPV-related pre-neoplastic lesions of maleexternal genitalia, oropharynx, and other ana- tomic sites among predominantly heterosexual men. No studies to date have been conductedassessing the natural history of HPV related precancerous genital lesion development in men. In addition, although HPV-related cancers inmen occur at a median age of 60 years and older, few male HPV natural history studies have included older men for HPV evaluation,limiting our understanding of HPV over the life span and in the years preceding onset of cancer. At genital sites, HPV causes 2 categories of external genital lesions (EGL): condyloma (geni- tal warts) and penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Genital warts are a common conditionreaching peak incidence in men ages 20 to 29 years. HPV types 6/11 are the most commonly detected in genital warts, although 20% to 50%appear to have coinfection with oncogenic HPV types. 4Unlike the United Kingdom, where data are available to estimate genital wart incidence,there are no comparable data systems in most other countries, including the United States. Therefore, outside of the United Kingdom, theincidence of genital warts is unknown. Although in most cases genital warts are a benign condi- tion, the diagnosis and treatment of these lesionsis associated with psychosocial distress and anxi- ety for the male as well as high medical expendi- tures for the health provider system. This isattributed in large part to the inadequate response and genital wart recurrence after appa- rent clearance. In the United States, a commontreatment is to prescribe self-treatment with Imi- quimod, which has a treatment efcacy of 40% in circumcised men and 62% in uncircumcised men. PIN lesions are thought to be precancerous lesions from which penile cancer arises. Although rare, penile cancer is associated witha high morbidity and mortality. There is large variation in the incidence of penile cancer, with low rates observed in the United States ( /C241/ 100,000) compared with Brazil, which has among the highest rates worldwide ( /C245/ 100,000). Using 2 different cancer registry datasets from the United States (SEER and NAACCR), we have shown that Hispanics have a signicantly higher incidence of penile cancercompared with other racial/ethnic groups. 5No State and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1413studies have estimated the prevalence of PIN, or examined progression of HPV infection toPIN, PIN incidence, or the factors associated with PIN development. Few studies have exam- ined PIN HPV type distribution, 6-8with most studies only testing for HPV 16 and 18. One study found a high proportion of HPV 16 and 18 coinfection with HPV types 5 and 8, cutaneouscarcinogenic viruses, suggesting multiple viral pathways to disease. This nding was corrobo- rated by others who examined HPV type distri-bution in penile carcinoma tumor specimens. Data from Stoler and colleagues suggest that PIN may be underidentied, or misidentied asgenital warts on visual inspection in clinical practice, 6demonstrating the need in research studies to obtain biopsy specimens so that histo-logical criteria are utilized in dening lesions and lesion material is available to identify HPV type(s) present (causal infections). This misclas-sication of PIN as genital warts upon visual inspection may underlie the relatively poor geni- tal wart treatment efcacy observed in theclinic. No study to date has dened the rate at which HPV infection progresses to EGLs, the proportion of infections that progress, nor thespecic type, and combination of types within the lesion responsible for EGLs. Because PIN and genital warts are reservoirs of infection fortransmission, these lesions have signicance for the disease status of the male as well as his female sexual partner. HPV Infections in External Male Genitalia. Until recently, in the literature there has been tre- mendous variability in the methods used to assess male HPV status, resulting in poor com-parability across studies and populations. Over the past several years, our group developed, and validated, methodologies to establish the repro-ducibility of genital HPV status assessment in men. 9In general, genital HPV infection preva- lence among healthy men appears to be as highas or higher than what has been observed among women. Based on our systematic review of the literature, genital HPV infection has beendetected in up to 73% of healthy men. 10In recent reports from our cross-sectional study of U.S. men, 51.2% were positive for at least oneknown oncogenic or nononcogenic HPV type and an additional (including prepuce in uncircumcised men), and scrotum are the sites that contributeto>95% of genital HPV infection detected. 9 Study results from our ongoing Human Papillo- mavirus Infection in Men (HIM) study foundHPV DNA in 50.5% in men. The proportion of low-risk types was 38.5%, and unclassied infec- tions were found in an additional 14.7%, 12simi- lar to our previous results among U.S. men.11In subsequent analyses in which we sequenced amplicons that did not hybridize with any of the37 HPV types on the linear array system, we observed presence of cutaneous HPV sequences. In specimens obtained from the surface of genitalwarts and lesions, we observe nearly 7% ''unclas- sied'' infections, suggesting that cutaneous HPV types are present on the penile skin, butmay have a lower rate of progression to disease compared with mucosal HPV types. Few studies have determined the correlates of genital HPV infections in men. 10In these studies, consistent positive associations between measures of sexual history, including lifetimeand recent number of sexual partners and sex- ual frequency, and HPV detection have been observed in the literature. Conversely, circumci-sion is consistently (4 of 6 studies) associated with reduced detection of HPV infection in men. 10,13In the HIM study, HPV prevalence was signicantly lower among circumcised men.12Less consistently (2 of 6 studies), condom use has been associated with reduced risk ofHPV detection in men. 10Most studies nd no association between age and HPV prevalence in men.10In the HIM study, we also found no rela- tion between age and HPV prevalence.13 Prospective Natural History Studies of Genital HPV Infection. Small prospective studies report rates of HPV acquisition and clearance in sexu-ally active men. However, the small sample sizes and short and inconsistent follow-up peri- ods have resulted in imprecise estimates of HPVincidence, duration, and antibody response in men. 10In our recent study of U.S. men,14the probability of acquiring an HPV infection amongheterosexual men ages 18 to 44 years was 29% per year, an estimate similar to that reported for young males attending university, 15and females of a similar age range.16Unlike what has been observed among women, we did not detect a clear age pattern in rates of HPV acqui-sition in men. 14In the HIM study, the 1414 State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009probability of acquiring an HPV infection among heterosexual men ages 18 to 70 years was 39%per year. The incidence of a new HPV infection was 5.2, 1.2, 6.0, and 2.4 per 1000-person months for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, respec-tively, whereas the 12-month cumulative risk of acquiring any of these 4 vaccine types was 13%. As observed in our smaller U.S. study, the over-all rate of acquiring any, oncogenic, and nonon- cogenic new HPV infections did not vary by age group (18-30, 31-44, and 45-70 years). The lackof an association with age suggests that the rel- atively constant HPV prevalence observed in cross-sectional studies may be attributable toacquisition of new infections. HPV Antibody Response in Men. Most information regarding antibody development in response to HPV infection is derived from studies ofwomen. Collectively, results of these studies indi- cate that antibody responses to HPV capsids are of low titer, slow to develop, and are only detecta-ble in roughly 50% of women with HPV DNA detected in the genital tract by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In women there is delayed sero-conversion (12-18 months) and lower seroconver- sion among those with transient compared with persistent infection. Few studies have evaluatedHPV antibody status in men, with most focusing on a single evaluation of HPV 16 sero-status. In our recent review of the literature, 1014 studies of HPV seroprevalence met our inclusion criteria, 11 of which evaluated HPV 16 seroprevalence. HPV 16 seropositivity was higher in STI clinicpopulations (19% to 48%) compared with 7.9% in males participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from1991 to 1994. 17Eight of 9 studies that compared seroprevalence in men and women reported a higher seroprevalence in women than in men.For example, among women participating in NHANES, 17.9% were HPV 16 seropositive. 17 Very few studies evaluated HPV 6 and 11 sero- prevalence, and only one study evaluated HPV 18 seroprevalence. HPV-6 or 11 seroprevalence ranged from 26% 41%. The single estimate ofHPV 18 seroprevalence was 19%. A recent popu- lation-based study of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 sero- prevalence reported peak seropositivity amongmen 40 to 49 years of age for types 6 and 11 of 15.4% and 9.1%, respectively, and among men 50 to 59 years of age for types 16 and 18 of 14.3%and 8.2%, respectively. 18In general, HPV sero-prevalence in males was associated with increas- ing age and sexual behavior. In our recentlycompleted cross-sectional study of men in 2 U.S. cities, the combined seroprevalence to HPV 6/11, 16, or 18 was 21% among men ages 18 to 40years. Host immunity is believed to play a central role in the control of HPV infections, as evi-denced by the high rates of infection and HPV- associated disease in immunosuppressed popula- tions, such as HIV infected individuals. Theprecise role of humoral immunity in immune pro- tection is unclear. Studies in women failed to show that preexisting type specic capsid anti-body protects against subsequent infection with the same type. However, the design of those stud- ies makes it difcult to distinguish reinfectionfrom reactivation, and the studies were not pow- ered to address the relationship between anti- body titer and protection. Animal studies andvaccine trials in humans clearly show that capsid antibody can confer protection against HPV infection. In addition, the duration of vaccinemediated immunity appears to last >5 years, but it is unknown whether immunity will be lifelong. CONCLUSIONS HPV infection is common in men and is readily transmitted, influencing disease rates in both males and females. Now that HPV vaccine ef- cacy has been demonstrated in males, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating males under differ- ent scenarios needs to be evaluated. The efcacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine to reduce infec-tion and lesions caused by HPV at a several dif- ferent anatomic sites continues to be tested among men internationally. Vaccination of malesmay become inevitable if and when vaccination of females fails to control disease because of sub- optimal adherence to vaccine recommendations.From a disease transmission perspective, female- only vaccination may work well for controlling cervical cancer should we achieve broad vaccinedissemination. However, both the realities of not achieving broad vaccine dissemination among females and the interest in preventing male dis-ease caused by HPV may force us to consider other strategies such as vaccinating males.

TUMOR HPV STATUS AND SURVIVAL Maura L. Gillison, MD, PhD Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio The current literature supports the conclusion that tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) statusis an important and independent predictor ofoverall and disease-specic survival for headand neck squamous cell carcinomas. The potential prognostic signicance of HPV in head and neck cancer was originally sug- gested in single-institutional case series, the majority of which reported tumor HPV status tobe a favorable biomarker for survival outcomes, particularly for oropharyngeal cancers. In these original reports, patients with HPV-positivetumors were estimated to have a 50% to 80% reduction in risk of disease-failure when com- pared with the HPV-negative patient. 1-4It may be appropriate to be skeptical of such retrospec- tive analyses because of the signicant hetero- geneity in patient populations with regard tosample size, methods for tumor HPV classica- tion, tumor stage, tumor treatment, and vari- able inclusion of other prognostic factors in theanalysis. However, the consistent ndings reported from study to study despite this hetero- geneity testify to the strength of the effect. In a recent meta-analysis of these case se- ries, 5patients with HPV-positive head and neck and a 38% (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.5-0.8) reduction in risk ofdisease failure when compared with the HPV- negative patient. When stratied by anatomic site of the primary, the survival benet was re-stricted HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Patients with to have a 28% (HR, 0.72;95% CI, 0.5-1.0) reduced risk of death and a 49% (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7) reduced risk of disease failure when compared with patientswith HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers. This meta-analysis had some limitations, as the esti- mates were derived from unadjusted hazards 1416 State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009and were not based on individual patient data. Additionally, no attempt was made to classifystudies based upon method used for tumor HPV classication, categorization likely resulting in false-positive classication that would biasresults toward the null. However, the inclusion of patients with recurrent or metastatic disease in the survival analysis may have biased resultsaway from the null, by worsening survival out- comes preferentially in the HPV-negative group. Nevertheless, the meta-analysis is a useful sum-mary of the existing literature from retrospec- tive, case series. Because of the initial reports noted earlier, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) incorporated an analysis of the effect of tumor HPV status on survival outcomes in aphase II trial of investigational therapy in patients with oropharyngeal and laryngeal can- cers, ECOG 2399. carboplatin induc- tion followed with radiosensitizing paclitaxel.Tumor HPV status was determined via a combi- nation of HPV in situ hybridization and PCR, and 40% of all cancers and 63% of oropharyn-geal cancers were found to be positive. After a median survival of 39 months, a patient with HPV-positive tumors had an improved overallsurvival and after adjustment for age, tumor stage and ECOG performance status had a 73% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, reduction 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15- 0.85) reduction in risk of death when compared with the HPV-negative patient. 6This was the rst study to demonstrate tumor HPV status to be a strong, independent and favorable prognos- tic biomarker in the context of a prospectiveanalysis in a uniformly staged and treated patient population. Retrospective analyses of prospectively acquired data are ongoing todetermine whether similar survival differences can be observed in the context of large, random- ized controlled clinical trials. The survival benet for the HPV-positive patient reported in ECOG 2399 was observed in the context of aggressive, multimodality ther-apy. It is important to note, however, that at this time it is unclear to what extent the sur- vival benet for the HPV-positive patientdepends on therapeutic choices. The magnitude of the survival difference observed in the ECOG trial has similarly been observed in studies inwhich oropharyngeal cancer patients weretreated with surgery with or without adjuvant radiation 7or radiation with or without surgery.8 In most of these studies, the 5-year overall sur- vival for the HPV-positive patient and for the HPV-negativepatient between 30% and 35%. In fact, the data, in total, suggest that the survival benet may be observed independent of the specic therapyadministered, as long as it is within the current standard of care. Therefore, some patients with HPV-positive tumors may be unnecessarilyexposed to treatments (induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation), which signicantly increase morbidity compared withradiation therapy alone. In addition to observational studies and clini- cal trials, the survival benet observed for theHPV-positive patient may also be apparent at the population level, according to a recent analysis of over 47,000 incident cases of oral cancer reportedto the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. 9In the United States during the period from 1973 through 2003, the incidence rate for cancers at sites etiologically related to HPV infec- tion signicantly increased, whereas signicantdeclines incidence were for oral can- cers not etiologically related to HPV. In concert with this increase, from 1973 to 2003, signicantimprovements in absolute, 2-year overall sur- vival were observed for patients treated with radiation therapy with local or regionally-advanced HPV-related cancers, but not for patients with HPV-unrelated cancers, respec- tively. This nding is consistent with the inter-pretation that recent improvements in the survival for patients with head and neck squa- mous cell carcinoma may in part be attributableto a shift in the underlying etiology of the disease and its inherent responsiveness to therapy. The underlying biological reasons for the improved survival for the HPV-positive patient are not entirely clear, but appear to be multifac- torial: (1) two prospective clinical trials haveobserved HPV-positive tumors to have a signi- cantly improved response to chemotherapy when compared with HPV-negative tumors 6,10; (2) patients with HPV-positive tumors also appear to have a lower risk of second primary can- cers7,11,12; (3) tumor HPV status inversely corre- lates with several poor prognostic biomarkers, such as a of smoking, sion10,13inactivating p53 mutations,14,15and nu- clear Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1417note, however, that some of these factors are so tightly correlated (eg, p53 mutation and HPV-negative tumors) that it is difcult to discern whether or not each remains independently asso- ciated with survival after accounting for theother. For instance, one study has suggested that smoking was not a signicant prognostic factor after accounting for HPV status, 10whereas another found HPV status had a minimal effect on survival outcomes among smokers, but smok- ing status had important impact among HPV-positives. HPV-positive nonsmokers have best outcome. 11Similarly, tumor HPV status was sug- gested to account for the survival benetobserved among patients without p53-mutant tumors. 7Correlative studies within large clinical trials conducted by the cooperative groups will berequired to gain further insights into the molecu- lar underpinnings of the survival difference, and will be important to the future potential of molec-ularly targeted therapies specic to the HPV- positive and HPV-negative patient. In summary, at this time data support the conclusion that tumor HPV status is an impor- tant prognostic biomarker for head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancer.Whether HPV status is associated with survival among the small proportion of nonoropharyng- eal cancers ( <5% or oral cavity or larynx can- cers) that may be etiologically associated with HPV is unclear, and may be difcult to evaluate, given the sample size that would be required.Nevertheless, it is clear that tumor HPV status should be incorporated, as a minimum, as a stratication factor in clinical trials includingpatients with oropharyngeal cancers. The Radia- tion Therapy Oncology Group has embraced this recommendation. In the ECOG, disease-specictrials for the HPV-positive versus HPV-negative patient are in development. Hence, the method for classication of tumors as HPV-positive or negative is of clinical importance. Based on the ECOG experience, tu- mor HPV status as determined by in situhybridization is currently the standard of care. 6 This assay correlates strongly with the analysisof viral oncogene expression in fresh-frozentumors, 16and has been predictive of survival outcomes, whereas HPV presence by PCR was not.17Quantication of viral load or p16 immu- nohistochemistry appear to be useful in discrim- from true-positive case when PCR is used.17P16 immunohistochemistry has been suggested as a potential alternativesurrogate marker for HPV status, and this is likely sufcient in the context of retrospectiveclinical trial analysis. However, the ramica- tions of clinical decision made from HPV typing of an individual patient must be considered. Inthe setting in which clinical trials will probably move toward deintensication of therapy for the HPV-positive patient, one must avoid undertreatment of the HPV-negative patient as a result of misclassication. High specicity and a high-positive predictive value are required.Assays for p16 are highly variable with regard to antibody used and the denition of a positive test. Additionally, unacceptable misclassicationrates from 10% to 20% would be expected. REFERENCES 1. H, Friesland S, R, Dalianis (HPV) in clinical correlates, risk of relapse, and sur- vival.

PANEL DISCUSSION: COUNSELING THE PATIENT WITH HPV-RELATED ORAL CANCER Moderator: Andy Trotti, MD H. Lee Moftt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL Panelists: Maura Gillison, MD, PhD, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus,OH; Patti E. Gravitt, PhD, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD; Erich M. Sturgis, MD, MPH, The University of Texas M. D. AndersonCancer Center, Houston, TX; Marshall Posner, MD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; Aimee Kreimer, PhD, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,MD; Susan Rosenthal, PhD, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY. Recognition that a sexually transmitted viral infection, human papillomavirus (HPV), is caus- ing oropharyngeal cancers has only recentlybeen disseminated. Epidemiologic and medical information on this topic is rapidly evolving. The relationship between HPV and oropharyn-geal cancer has provoked a broad range of medi- cal questions as well as sensitive psychological, sexual, and social issues. The incidence rates forthese cancers are clearly on the rise in the United States; and they affect a younger popula- tion largely without traditional risk factors forhead and neck cancer. Therefore, community- based providers of cancer care will have an increasing likelihood of encountering patientswith a diagnosis of HPV-positive head and neck cancer each year. Understanding and communi- cating the complexities of the infection, the de-velopment of cancer, the prognostic implications, and treatment options is a challenge for both clinicians and their patients. The purpose of this panel was to discuss the best currently available medical advice for prac- titioners to offer to patients in response to com-mon but difcult-to-answer questions. Sinceclinicians have limited experience with elding these questions, it was suggested that a panel ofexperts actively involved in HPV research may be useful in articulating their opinions or the best available answers at this time. The panel was composed of expert clinicians, clinician-scientists, epidemiologists, and labora-tory scientists. The format was a case-based dis- cussion of questions a clinician may commonly encounter in counseling patients. The resultingdiscussion is therefore designed to serve both the medical and lay communities. A Summary of the Issues and Discussion. Based on the case presentation, a range of issues were discussed, beginning with the methods of spreadof the virus. Dr. Kreimer reviewed the HPV types that are associated with benign and ma- lignant disease, as well as what is known aboutthe latency period. The HPV type of principal concern for oral cancers is HPV16, and it is cur- rently estimated that infection precedes develop-ment of cancer by at least 10 years. She also covered the prevalence of HPV in the general population and compared oral ( <10%) and geni- tal (/C2425% in women and 60% in men) rates, not- ing there are far fewer data on the oral rates. Dr. Sturgis discussed the general lack of clin- ical features of the initial infection and showed examples of benign papillomas. He noted that the initial infection in most cases is completelyasymptomatic. Dr. Gravitt discussed the need for a standard clinical test (eg, oral swab) to test for presence of the virus. Currently, there is noaccurate test to assess oral infection, nor are the cancer implications of an oral infection suf- ciently understood. Dr. Gillison discussed sexual behaviors capa- ble of viral transmission, including oral sex and oral to oral (kissing) contact. She described howshe responds to sensitive questions from State of the Science: HNSCC and HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009 1419patients and partners, for example, whether the newly diagnosed patient should refrain from sexor certain types of sex. For committed and monogamous partners, she recommends no change in behavior. For new partners, she rec-ommends consistent use of barrier methods dur- ing oral and vaginal sex because this is known to decrease rates of transmission of a number ofsexually transmitted infections including HPV. She noted how sexual issues can add stress to an already stressful situation related to a cancerdiagnosis and treatment. It is important to address these issues openly. She recommends patients and partners seek professional relation-ship counseling in some cases. The topic of cancer screening for current or past partners was addressed by several of the pan-elists. Current female partners should undergo routine gynecologic screening as practiced in the general population per American Cancer Societyguidelines. There is no evidence to support rou- tine oral screening exams of partners, unless they are unduly concerned. In such cases, an examina-tion and discussion of oral cancer risk factors by an otolaryngologist will help inform and reassure. Screening policies and technology for detect- ing HPV-related oral cancer were also covered. Dr. Rosenthal noted there is currently no oral equivalent of a pap smear for HPV-related oralcancer at this time. A number of studies are under way, including a ''brush'' test of the oral cavity and tonsil region and oral rinses studies.Dr. Sturgis noted that it is much harder to thor- oughly examine the crypts of the tonsils and base of tongue than the cervix. More studies areneeded on the efciency and sensitivity of sam- pling techniques. The role of the Gardasil (Merck) vaccine was discussed. The Gardasil vaccine is not a treat- ment for an established cancer. It is for the pre- vention of viral infection and must beadministered before exposure to the virus, which means before one becomes sexually active. It has a tremendous potential to reduce the rates of oralcancer in future generations, but it has no benet and is not under study as a cancer treatment. The observation that HPV-related oral can- cers are much more common in males than females was discussed. A number of hypotheses to explain this are currently under considerationincluding gender differences in immune surveil- lance, local tissue factors, the generally higher number of sex partners among men, andchanges in sexual practices since the 1960s.There are little to no data to support any of these hypotheses currently. Dr. Gillison briefly reviewed the growing body of data showing that HPV-related cancers are associated with a very good prognosis. However,most of the panel felt strongly that this does not mean that these patients can be treated with less aggressive treatments as part of the standard ofcare at this time. Reducing treatment intensity may carry an increased risk of not curing the can- cer. For patients seeking less aggressive treat-ments, it is strongly recommend that patients enroll in clinical trials testing these questions. Dr. Posner noted the NCCN Guidelines describe a number of options based on stage and other factors. Although there are no data yet to support a change in therapy based on HPV sta-tus, he does consider HPV status in relation to the volume of cancer on an individual basis to select less aggressive treatments among the cur-rently available options. The role that smoking may play in develop- ment or treatment outcome of HPV-related can-cer was reviewed. Although tobacco does not seem to be a strong cofactor for the development of HPV-related cancer, preliminary data suggesta history of tobacco use may negatively affect what is an otherwise excellent prognosis for HPV-related cancers. Dr. Sturgis discussed standard follow-up rec- ommendations after cancer treatment. There was consensus that patients with both HPV-related and unrelated cancers currently follow the same program, as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines. These involve head and neck examsevery 3 to 4 months and an annual chest X-ray. Dr. Posner addressed the risk of second cancers in HPV-positive versus -negative patients.Although only a few long-term studies are avail- able, the data suggest there is a somewhat higher rate of second cancer development in an HPV-posi-tive patient population compared with the general population, but this is not as high as cancer rates in HPV-negative patients, which may be up to 30%to 40% risk at 10 years. More data are needed. The panel concluded that the recent recogni- tion of HPV-related cancers as a distinct entityraises a number of important social, scientic, and therapeutic issues that have only begun to be addressed in a systematic manner. Thismeeting and others will help dene the most im- portant studies to be conducted in the near future, and help establish the standards of carefor this unique population. 1420 State of the Science: HPV HEAD & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed November 2009PANEL DISCUSSION: CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THERAPEUTIC TRIAL DESIGN BASED ON HPV STATUS Moderator: David J. Adelstein, MD Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH Panelists: John A. Ridge, MD, PhD, Fox Chase CancerCenter, Philadelphia, PA; Kian Ang, MD, PhD, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Gregory Wolf, MD, University ofMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Arlene Forastiere, MD, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; David Brizel, MD, Duke UniversityMedical Center, Durham, NC Based on the recognized favorable prognosis after treatment for patients with human papillomavi-rus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, the question of how to proceed in clinical trial design was posed to the panel. It was acknowledged thatcurrent information does not support therapeutic recommendations based on HPV status. It was also agreed that future clinical trials for patientswith oropharyngeal cancer should at least be stratied by HPV status, with most attendees favoring separate clinical trial initiatives for theHPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. The debate focused on the appropriate treat- ment approach for these good-prognosis HPV-positive patients, in whom prospective and retro- spective studies suggest a 2-year survival in excess of 80%. To convincingly demonstrate anystatistically signicant improvement in this out- come, a very large randomized phase III trial would be required. Given current rates of clinicaltrial accrual in the United States, such a study might require 8 to 10 years to complete, and the questions asked by such a trial would likely beirrelevant by the time they were answered. It was repeatedly noted that the excellent results achieved in this patient population come onlyat the cost of the signicant short- and long- term morbidity associated with current multimo- dality treatments. Considerable sentiment was expressed favoring a change in the focus of future clinical trials for these patients. Ratherthan attempting to improve survival endpoints, the question might become one of reducing treat- ment-related morbidity in this patient popula-tion. Treatment deintensication was suggested as an investigational strategy, with the hope that toxicity could be reduced without compromisingoutcomes. A phase III noninferiority trial was deemed impractical given the large number ofpatients required. Instead, there was near con- sensus that a large randomized phase II study design, with a standard control arm would be areasonable way to proceed. An alternative approach was also strongly voiced. Although patients with HPV-positive oro-pharyngeal cancer have an excellent prognosis, not all are cured. Future clinical investigation should focus on those patients not cured withcurrent treatments and should attempt to improve their outcomes. Although deintensica- tion to modify toxicity may be a valid philosophyfor patient populations, any individual patient seeks the best chance for cure. Ideally we should try to identify the poor prognosis HPV-positivepatients for whom current therapies fail, so that alternative and more successful treatment approaches can be chosen. The importance ofsmoking in the HPV-positive patient population was noted as a potential prognosticator. It was also acknowledged that as we further subdividethese patients population, the timely completion of clinical trials becomes more difcult. There was considerable discussion focused on possible ways to deintensify treatment, and to improve results in those poor prognosis HPV- positive patients. It was recognized that thereis, at present, insufcient information to make a fully informed decision. In particular, it is im- portant to understand the patterns of failure inthe HPV-positive patients after treatment. Dis- tant disease failure might demand more focus on systemic treatment, perhaps with a reductionin the intensity of locoregional management. A preponderance of locoregional failure, however, would preclude that strategy. Several suggestions for future study were made. A standard control arm such as radiation and high-dose single-agent cisplatin was felt tobe important in any study design. Other phase II arms suggested included exploring a lower dose of radiation therapy with cisplatin, a standarddose of radiation therapy with reduced, modied, or no chemotherapy, induction chemotherapy fol- lowed by radiation, or radiation with a biologicagent. The inherent difculty of assessing toxic- ity endpoints was acknowledged. The panel discussion was followed by a work- shop focused on the specics of clinical trial design for previously untreated patients based on HPV status. A proposal was introduced bythe Radiation Therapy Oncology Group for State of the Science: HNSCC and & NECK\u2014DOI 10.1002/hed multiarm randomized phase II study in HPV-positive patients. Potential treatment armswere discussed and the importance of limiting this study to the good prognosis, nonsmoking HPV-positive patient population was stressed. Given the infrequency of HPV positivity at other primary tumor sites in the head and neck, it was felt reasonable to combine the patientswith hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer and the HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer patientsfor clinical trial design. Several potential phase II approaches were discussed and were felt to bereasonable, in an effort to improve outcomes in this patient population. Reintroduction of sur- gery at an earlier stage in patient managementwas also suggested. Further development and renement of these potential HPV-based treatment designs will beundertaken by the cooperative groups. Formal proposals are anticipated in the near future. MEETING SUMMARY The meeting closed with a summary of current accomplishments and goals for the future. HPV-positive squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx represents a new and emerging disease, with a natural history and prognosis, which differsfrom that of HPV-negative oropharyngeal can- cer, and from squamous cell cancers originating in other head and neck sites. It was recognizedthat this disease must be studied separately from the HPV-negative cancers and that further attempts should be made to identify those clini-cal and molecular features that might predict treatment success. Additional short-term goals include the standardization and disseminationof laboratory methodology for HPV testing, and the further development of HPV-based clinical trials. Intermediate and long-term goals include a better characterization of the epidemiology oforal HPV infection and its implications for the development of malignancy, as well as the implementation of screening and preventionstrategies. The implications of the potential for HPV vaccination and its impact on the incidence of this disease were noted. Acknowledgments.
