As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love To strengthen our s piritual immune system referring to the holistic approach - mind, body and spirit, is t he ability to withstand and survive in life, through all its ups and down s, and to connect more deeply with God, our community, our environment and ourselves. Since the COVID -19 Virus pandemic started we have been he aring the things that we should do to boost and strengthen our physical immune system. But w e are leaving out the most important spiritual tool that we need to strengthen our spiritual system. If our spiritual system is not strengthened, we will be prone to lots of unspiritual diseases such as fear, anxiety, hatred, anger, bitterness, doubt, resentment, envy, unhealthy relationships , depression and negativism. By nourishing our soul well, we can find more joy, self-love , gratitude, and vitality to improve and strengthen our spiritual immune system . When we look at nourishing both types of immune systems (physical and spiritual) it can be challenging, but each has the same basic needs: immune systems need nutritious food , water hydration , exercise , plenty of rest , absence of the junk foods, loving relationships and the need of pure thoughts. We are living in a dangerous world. Just look around you. Everyone is angry , fearful and more pessimistic than at any time in our collective memory. It seems as if there is a pending sense of danger and doom. Something dangerous seems like it is waiting in the wings . To counteract this , we have to carefully and prayerfully, let the Holy Spirit speak to us as we boost our spiritual immune system. And to do so, we must read and study our bible; prayer is like a healthy dose of vitamin C at the first sign of a cold. The first thing we should do when troubles come is meditate on the word, have a clear conscience, attend church regularly , do service to God and to others, dev elop healthy relationships and lifestyles, give/share, and fellowship with other Christians. We will be healthier spiritually when these principles are implement ed consistently. And the healthier we are, the more likely we are to withstand the infections /storms of this world. When you choose to ingest a healthy diet of God's Word, you will build a spiritual immunity that provides vitality in the midst of all life's challenging circumstances. Prayer: God, my Strength and Song, we come to You today asking for a strong spiritual immune system for our body , mind and soul . Please bless our body with the power and vitality we need to accomplish all that you have set before us to do, and grant that our mind s can focus and think c learly and quick ly. We thank You for supplying us with t he strength and energy to do the work you have for us to do, and to bring glory to Your Name. Amen.
