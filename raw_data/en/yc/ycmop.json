CeD is therefore managed using a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), the only effective treatment avail able currently. However, the GFD is restrictive. Hence, efforts are being made to explore alternative therapies. Based on their mechanisms of action on various molecular tar gets involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, these therapies may be classied into o ne of the following ve broad approaches. The rst approach focuses on decreasi ng the immunogenic content of gluten, using strategies like genetically modi ed wheat, intra-intestinal gluten digestion using glutenases, microwave tment kernels, fu transglutaminase. The second approach involv es sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before it is digested into immunogenic peptide s and absorbed, using binder drugs like polymer p(HEMA-co-SS), single chain frag ment variable (scFv), and anti- gluten antibody AGY. The third approach aims to preven t uptake of digested gluten through intestinal epithelial tight junctions, usi ng a zonulin antagonist. The fourth approach involves tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibito rs to prevent the enhancement of immunogenicity of digested gluten by the intestinal tTG e nzyme. The fth approach seeks to prevent downstream immune activation after uptake of gluten immunogenic peptides through the intestinal mucosal epithelial layer. Examples include HLA-DQ2 blockers that prevent presentation of gluten derived- anti gens by dendritic cells to T cells, therapies the agents targeting TNF- and interleukin-15. Apart from these approaches, research is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics/pre biotics, helminth therapy using Necatoramericanus ,lowFODMAPdiet,andpancreaticenzymesupplementationin CeD symptom control; however, the mechanisms by which they play a benecial role in CeD areyettobeclearlyestablished.Overall,althoughmanyth erapiesbeingexploredarestill in the pre-clinical phase, some like the zonulin antagonist , immune tolerizing therapies and glutenases have reached phase II/III clinical trials. Wh ile these potential options appear exciting, currently they may at best be used to supple ment rather than supplant the GFD.

Although initially believed to aect only the intestine, it i s now considered to be a systemic autoimmune disease. The consequent spectrum of manifestations of CeD is wide, rangin g from gastrointestinal and nutritional derangements resul ting andliverdiseases,amongextra-intestinalmanifestation s(2).For the ( and their care providers ( 4,5), it can adverselyaectthequalityoflife. Since the discovery of dietary gluten as the causative agent six decades ago ( 6), our comprehension of the pathophysiology of CeD has grown substantially. This process has been facilitated by documented clinical observations as well as exponential advancements in immunology and molecular medicine. However, the cornerstone of management of CeD is based on the lesson learnt from that discovery itself, and it still remains the gluten- free diet (GFD). Patients may nd the GFD and related lifestyle modication to be burdensome, due to i ts poor satisfactoriness, unavailability and higher costs ( 7). In fact, hyper- vigilance to GFD adherence can also aect quality of life (8), much like the disease itself. This has in turn created an unmet need for alternatives ( 9). Also, there may be patients who remain persistently symptomatic despite a GFD, in whom adjuncttherapiesmayberequired( 10).Herein,wehavereviewed the principles of potential, alternative dietary and non-diet ary therapeutic strategies and their current status of investig ation (SupplementaryTable1 ). PATHOGENESIS In a broad sense, the pathogenesis of CeD may be considered to be a result of the interplay of genetic susceptibility and immunologicalfactors,describedasfollows. Genetic Basis CeD is caused by autoimmunity to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, with frequently observed familial clustering ( 11). The main implicated alleles are the HLA- DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, that contribute to 30-50% of genetic susceptibility ( 12). Genotyping studies have also identied non- HLA variants associated with CeD, with most genes in these variants involved in the structure or function of immune cel ls (13-16). However, the non-HLA genes carry only a modest increase in the risk of CeD ( 17). Regardless, all these genes represent potential targets for therapeutics. Some of them, al ong withtheirrespectivelociaresummarizedin Table1. Immunogenicity of Gluten Gluten is found in wheat as well as barley, rye and oats. Glute n is composed of two peptide conglomerates viz. glutelins and prolamins ( 18). Of these, prolamins are the gluten components that are implicated in CeD; they are found variously in dieren t grains as gliadins in wheat, secalins in rye, a mix of both in triticale, hordeins in barley, and avenins in oats. In wheat , gliadins are in turn composed of sub-fractions- /,,1,2,TABLE 1 | Common gene loci involved in celiac Gene 19). At the molecular level, gliadins are made predominantly of multiple glutamine (35%) amino acid residues linked to proline (15%) ( 20). Presence of proline makes the structure of prolamins complex as well as sterically inaccessible/ resistant to proteolytic enzymes of the human stomach and intestine. Consequently, these luminal proteases only succeed in diges ting the prolamins into larger oligopeptides. These oligopeptides are immunogenic in CeD ( 21) and some of them include, the mostimmunotoxic,33-merpeptide57-89(withtheaminoacid sequence LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPLPYPQPQLPYPQPQPF), and relatively less immunogenic digested gliadin peptides enter the lamina propria of the small intestine across the epithelial barrier, by a parace llular pathway that involves the protein zonulin ( Figure2). is structurally toxin associat ed withVibrio cholera and has been observed to be a controller of epithelial permeability. In the zonulin pathway, gliadin products attach to the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on the luminal aspect of the intestinal epithelium. CXCR3 in turn increases the formation of zonulin, which relaxes the inter - epithelial tight junctions through the PAR2/EGFR (Protease activatedreceptor2/EpithelialGrowthFactorReceptor)pathwa y. This increased permeability leads to influx of gliadin ( 28). An alternative pathway implicated in gliadin uptake is the transcellular pathway. This involves secretory Immunoglobul in A (IgA) that co-localizes with another molecule, the CD71 to promotetranscellularuptakeofgliadinproductsintothelamina propria (29). CD71 is the transferrin receptor, but is found to be expressed in higher amounts on the luminal aspect of intestina l epithelialcellsinCeD. The tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG-2) enzyme modies mucosa, by deamidating their glutamine residues to glutamate . These negatively charged glutamate side chains have a higher potential to be recognized as immunogenic. Also, by virtue of the relatively large size of these partially digested proli ne containing fragments, and the negative charge of glutamate, they tend to settle and form bonds with the neighboring extracellular matrix, resulting in immobilized neoepitopes. The formation of these bonds may be directly catalyzed by the tTG Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of composition of wheat gluten. G luten refers to the water insoluble protein component left a fter washing wheat flour. In various cereals, gluten is a conglomerate of peptides, composed of t wo main fractions-prolamins (known as gliadins in wheat), a nd glutelins (known as glutenins in wheat). These fractions differ in their solubility in alcohol; the f ormer of these is alcohol soluble. Also, prolamins occur in m onomeric form with intrachain disulphide bridges formed by cysteine residues. Glutelins, in contrast, occur as polymers formed by interchain disulphide bridges in addi tion to intrachain bridges. composed of further subfractions- /,(each having intrachain disulphide bridges) and (having no disulphide bridges) which differ in their electr ophoretic mobilities in a low pH medium. Glutenin fraction, upon reduction of the interchai n bridges, in turn yield high molecular weight (HMW), and low molecular weight (LMW) fractions depending on their mobility on SDS PAGE electrophoresis. High molecul ar weight fractions of glutelin have less disulphide bonds c ompared to the low molecular weight fractions. (30). Ultimately, all the gluten- derived antigens are recogniz ed and processed by the HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 bearing antigen presenting cells (APCs), and facilitating a self-propagating mechanism of gliadin uptake. T- cells also activate B-cells which mature to produce antibodi es against gluten and tissue transglutaminase-2 (celiac anti bodies). These antibodies further contribute to the ensuing immune- mediated enteropathy. As well, the immunotoxicity is mediat ed through the increased production of interleukin-15 (IL-15) by the intestinal epithelial cells and the intraepithelial lymph ocytes (IEL). IL-15 upregulates the receptor Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D) expression on IEL which interacts with MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B (MIC-A and MIC-B) ligands displayed on epithelial cells ( 31). also NK receptor called CD94/NKG2C.

NOVEL THERAPIES FOR CELIAC DISEASE Our understanding of the pathogenetic pathway of CeD has provided the context for the development of new drugs that target dierent aspects of this pathway. An overview of the mechanisms of action of these drugs is given in Figure2. The therapeutic options for CeD (SupplementaryTable1 ) currently being investigated can be broadly classied as belonging to one of the followingapproaches.Approach 1: Decreasing Immunogenic Epitopes in the genome AABBDD,whereinchromosomes1and6predominantlyharbor thegenesknowntocodeforimmunotoxiccomponentsofgluten (34). Attempts have been made to manipulate these genes to attenuate immunotoxicity. However, doing so may also alter the gastronomic properties of wheat, the yield etc, if these propertiesaregovernedbythesameorneighboringgeneticloc i. Althoughstudieshaveexploredthegeneticmanipulationofthe se chromosomes, avariantthatis both safeinCeD andsuitable f or commercialproductionisyettobefound. A study explored a variant formed by the removal of genes on chromosome 1 that code for ,, and gliadin fractions. While the toxicity was attenuated, the mechanical properties of wheatwerenotaltered.However,when fractionwasattenuated instead, the mechanical properties were compromised while also signicantly reducing the dose of immunogenic T cell epitopes( 35). Prolamins from a wheat variant called C173 were tested in vitroon intestinal epithelial cells derived from CeD patients. This variant was formed by the removal of predominantly toxic epitopes in gliadin fractions viz. Gli-A2, Gli-D1, worsening of villous: crypt (V:C) ratio, however there was an increase in pro- inflammatory cytokines like IFN- , TNF- as well as in anti- tTG antibody levels in the collected supernatant ( 36). Therefore, this was unlikely to be suitable for furtherclinicaltestinginCeD. In another recent development, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium delivered a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of the Chinese spring wheat (37). The sequence is referred to as the RefSeq v1.0. The process started in 2005 and has now yielded the sequence of Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease FIGURE 2 | Target sites of therapeutics along the pathogenetic pathwa y of celiac disease. Sites of action of therapeutic approach es under investigation (enclosed in black boxes) are shown at different levels of the pathogenet ic pathway of celiac disease. Green arrows in the gure depict a stimulatory effect. The oligomers (G) formed from gluten digestion enter the lamina propria of the small intestine across the epithelial barrier. They do so by a paracellular pathway that involves the protein zonulin. Zonulin is structurally similar to the zona occlud ens toxin expressed by Vibriocholera and regulates epithelial permeability at apical tight junc tions. In the zonulin products attach to the chemokine re ceptor CXCR3 on the luminal aspect of the intestinal epithel ium that increases the formation of zonulin. The zonulin then relaxes the interepithelial tight junctio ns through the PAR2/EGFR (Protease activated receptor 2/Epit helial Growth Factor Receptor) pathway. This increased permeability in turn leads to influx of gliadin. An a lternative pathway implicated in gliadin uptake is the tran scellular pathway involving secretory IgA (Immunoglobluin A) and CD71. CD71 or transferrin receptor is found to be expressed in higher amounts on the luminal aspect of intestinal epithelial cells in CeD. The CD71 co- localizes with secretory IgA and has been postulated to promote transcellular gliadin uptake into the lamina pro pria in CeD. Zonulin antagonists, CXCR3 antagonists, and sIgA/CD71 pathway antagonists would preven t gliadin transport through either of these two pathways. On ce the gluten immunogenic epitopes and -DQ8 be aring antigen presenting (APCs) recognize the epitop es. Consequently, APCs activate CD4 + helper T cells, setting off an inflammatory cascade. Cathepsi ns play a role in processing the antigens in APCs and promotin g the interaction between APCs and CD4 + T cells. Cytokines like IFN- and TNF- are released by activated CD4 +cells, which further aggravate this permeability and facil itate a self-propagating mechanism. T-cells also which to produce antib odies blockers, anti-cytokine therapy, and cathepsin inhibitors are some of the therapeut ic approaches being explored. In addition, the tissue transg lutaminase-2 (tTG-2) enzyme deamidates the resulting d eamidated gliadin peptides are more immunogenic. Also, by v irtue of the relatively large size of these partially digested, negatively charged proline containing fragment s, they tend to settle and form bonds with neighboring tissue s resulting in immobilized neoepitopes. Thus, these peptides form immunoreactive autoantigens and enter opathy ensues. tTg-2 enzyme inhibitors are being explored a s therapeutic options. The immunotoxicity is mediated by the increased production of interleukin-15 (IL- 15) by the intestinal epithelial cells as well as by the intra epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in CeD. IL-15 upregulates the receptor NKG2D (Natural Killer Group) expr IEL which interacts with MIC-A and MIC-B (MHC class I po lypeptide-related sequence A and B) displayed on epithelial cells. IELs in patients with CeD also express an NK receptor called CD94/NKG2C. CD94/NKG2C recogni zes HLA-E, a protein that is upregulated in epithelial cells in response to Interferon- (IFN-). The interaction of these two ligand- receptor pairs activ ates the IELs and triggers them to kill epithelial cells through perforins. Among other therapeutic options, gluten from wheat may be rendered non-immunogenic by geneti c modication. Attenuation of immunotoxicity has also been attempted using microwave ene rgy application on hydrated wheat kernels or by gluten modic ation either using glutenases transglutaminase. Alternat gliadin the intestina l lumen using polymeric binders, AGY or oral Immunoglobulin Y, and recombinant single chain Fragment var iable. 107,891high-condencegenes,includingthegenomicconte xtof their regulatory sequences. This has the potential to fast tr ack development of genetically engineered wheat with attenuate d immunotoxicity while preserving its gastronomic or agronom ic properties( 38).Intraluminal Digestion of Gluten Using Oral Glutenases In order for gliadin-derived oligomers to enter the lamina propria and still not induce an immune reaction, the oligomers should contain nine amino acids or less ( 39). Therefore, gluten Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease degrading enzymes (glutenases) that digest gliadin into pept ides with nine or less amino acid moieties have been explored as a therapeutic option in CeD. Most of these are glutamine and proline specic enzymes, since these are the principal amino acids found in immunogenic motifs of gluten. The forthcomin g sectionswillhighlightsomeoftheseenzymes. optimally active at low pH, resist ant topepsinbutlysedatphysiologicalconcentrationsoftrypsin, and has good specicity for the sequence QXP, which is abundant in the 33-mer as well as other immunotoxic gluten sequences. These factors make it a good t for therapy in CeD as a gastric activeenzyme( 40).Gassetal.studieditsactioninanimalmodels. They observed the complete digestion and liquefaction of a gluten containing meal into a viscous fluid in gliadin-sensi tized Wistar rats that were fed this enzyme along with the meal. The stomachs of the rats that did not get the enzyme contained a relatively solid, dry paste-like material post digestion of the same meal. This eect was even more evident at higher doses and extended digestion times ( 41). One of the concerns with any gastric-based glutenase is that if the gastric emptying o ccurs before the complete digestion of gluten, immunotoxic residu e wouldreachtheduodenumandinducethedisease.Itistheref ore reasonable to combine this enzyme with other glutenases whi ch are stable in the gastric environment but start acting when t he foodchymereachesduodenum,preemptinganyimmunotoxicity intheintestinalepithelium. Proline potential glutenases. They are ser ine proteasesandeachhasalarger -propellerdomainandasmaller, N-terminal catalytic domain that breaks the peptide bond of proline residues at the carboxy end of the gluten protein ( 42). Activity of SC-PEP extends into the acidic range of pH, and is by and large, unaltered in the presence of pepsin ( 43). However, theothertwoPEPsarelysedbypepsin.Furthermore,FM-PEPis inactivatedbythesmallintestinalenzymetrypsininthepres ence ofbileacids.MX-PEPtooisunstableinthepresenceofbilesal ts (44). Considering these limitations, SC-PEP has been explored as a more favorable candidate for therapy in CeD. In order to improve its action further, mutant variants (variant 10,224 or 10,230) of SC-PEP have been developed which have 200-fold higher resistance to pepsin and 20% higher turnover at high for gluten has relatively low specicity for long peptide sequences. This is because the larger -propeller domain preferentially allows smaller gliadin fragments into the active site, and therefore, is unable to completely eliminate the immunogenic gliadin peptides. This limitation could be overcome by combining it with other enzymes with complementary specicity. Combination of EP-B2 with SC-PEP,for instance has been explored for application in CeD. The EP-B2 eciently digests the 33 mer peptides into smaller, not necessarily non-toxic proline containing fragments. The PEP complements its action by digesting the proline- glutamine links in these smaller oligopeptides, thereby reducing their immunotoxicity.Gasstestedthiscombinationonratmodels and found that 1:1 ratio of this oral enzyme combination was more ecacious than either enzyme alone in reducing immunotoxic oligopeptidesfromgliadin( 46). Several clinical trials have been conducted to assess the eectiveness of this enzyme mixture in making dietary gluten safe for patients with CeD. One of the most prominent of these has been using the enzyme cocktail ALV 003, now known as latiglutenase. Latiglutenase is a proprietary, 1:1 combinati on of EP-B2, or ALV 001 plus PEP, or ALV 002. A randomized control trial (RCT) studied CeD patients on GFD, who received a diet containing gluten (16 g/day for 3 days) pre-treated with either ALV003 or placebo (NCT00859391). The ALV003 group showed signicantly lower immunological activation , as seen on peripheral T cell IFN- responses to gliadin ( 47). A phase 2a RCT (NCT00959114) on 41 CeD patients on GFD, found that on gluten challenge (with 2g bread crumb for 6 weeks), V:C deteriorated signicantly less in patien ts treatedwithALV003thanwithplacebo.However,intraepithel ial CD3+lymphocytes remained unchanged in the ALV003-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. This study was alsosignicantforhavingusedbreadcrumbstosimulaterea llife gluten intake as opposed to pre-digested gluten ( 48). Although the aforementioned clinical trials were promising, the resu lts of the most recent large-scale phase 2 b trial (NCT01917630) were disappointing. Four hundred ninety CeD patients who were symptomatic despite GFD for a year, were included in a dose ranging, placebo-controlled double-blinded study. I n a modied intention-to-treat diere nces were observed on histological, serological or symptomatic e nd- points (49). In apost-hocanalysis of data, it was found that there was signicant reduction in the abdominal symptoms in those patients who were seropositive for celiac antibody. The authors concluded that seronegative patients did not experience any symptomatic improvement, possibly because their symptoms may be attributable to non-celiac causes ( 50). Another phase 2 study is underway to test the eect of ALV003 on histopathological parameters of 80 CeD patients who had been adherent to a GFD (NCT03585478). Overall, therefore, t he eectivenessofALV003remainstobeestablished. Kuma030 is an engineered glutenase developed by the Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington. Pri or to its development, the investigators identied a naturally occurring enzyme from the acidophilic microbe serin e endoprotease, with optimal activity over the pH range of 2-4/37C and therefore adaptable for use in the gastric environment ( 51). Based on the structure of KumaWT, an enzyme was designed, with specicity toward known gliadin peptides. The new enzyme called KumaMax or Kuma010, had 116 times higher proteolytic activity, and 877 times higher specicity for the target gliadin oligopeptides. This enzyme w as Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease further modied to result in several-fold higher activity a gainst immunogenic 33-mer and 26-mer peptides. This version was called Kuma030. In comparison to SC PEP- EP B2, Kuma030 seemed to be more ecient. At the highest concentration of the PEP-EP B2 i.e. 1:10 weight/weight (w/w) ratio, gluten wa s degraded by of 1:40 gliadin pre-treated wit h Kuma030, a dose dependent reduction in IFN- production and T cell proliferation was observed ( 52). In light a glutenase with optimum activity at gastric pH between 3 and 5. It is also similarly resistant to proteolysis by pepsin, but has 60 times faster action compared to another prolyl endopeptidase such as MX-PEP ( 53).A.niger, the fungus from which this enzyme is derived is a food grade microbe, availab le on an industrial scale. AN-PEP has therefore been explored for suitability as an oral supplement. Being a relatively non- specic enzyme, it has less specicity for immunogenic epitopes gluten. However, it is highly ecient in degrading gliadi n intosmallerpeptides,andmaypotentiateactionofmorespecic enzymes if used in combination. It is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials ( 54). In preliminary studies, the enzyme has been foundtocatalyzealmostcompletedegradationofglutenepito pes even in complex food matrices such as in fast food meal. Also, co-administration of AN-PEP with gluten to CeD patient s led to a complete elimination of T-cell stimulatory peptides from both gliadins and glutenins within 2h, as measured in their gastric aspirates ( 55,56). Another trial (NCT00810654) randomized CeD patients 7g of gluten along with eitherplaceboorAN-PEPfor14days.Nosignicantdierencei n serology,symptoms,orhistopathologywasobservedbetweent he groups, with no patient in either group showing any signicant deterioration.However,mucosalIgAtTGdepositswereobser ved in four patients in the placebo group compared to 1 in the AN- PEP group, showing some mitigation of serological response in the latter ( 57). Trials with bigger samples and longer follow up are warranted for conclusive results on the therapeutic valu e of the enzyme. Tolerase G is a commercially available form of thisenzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase- IV (DPP-IV) is an exopeptidase that acts the amino-terminal side to liberate X-Pro dipeptides in gliadin. It occurs naturally in small amounts in the small intestinal brush border. It has been obtained commercially from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae and its potential as a glutenase has beeninvestigated.Onitsown,DPP-IVhasmodesteciencyas it canonlyactonpeptidesstartingwithX-Pro.Additionally,DP P- IV has a neutral pH optimum and hence it starts action only in the intestine. Addition of AN-PEP to DPP-IV may however improve its eciency. The combination when administered as an oral mixture has been found to successfully degrade small amounts of gluten ( 54). Because of non-specicity of AN-PEP and the proteolytic eect of DPP-IV, the eect of thiscombinationappearstobemodest,atbest.Thiscombinati onwas studied as a part of STAN1, a cocktail of microbial enzymes commonly used in food supplements.

This enzyme possessescollagenaseandglutenaseactivityandoccursnatu rally as a zymogenic precursor in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). In a gastric like milieu, it exhibits relative resistance to pe psin cleavage, as well as optimal activity at a pH of 3.0/37C. Upon incubation with gluten, it causes the cleavage of ,, , and glutenin fractions. However, in presence of trypsin/pH 8.0/37C, the enzyme is susceptible to destruction. Hence it may be eective only in the gastric digestion of wheat gluten prior to the food bolus reaching the intestine ( 59). Further in vitrotesting to study its eciency as detoxifying enzyme preparation a RCT, upon co-administration of caricain with 1g gluten daily to 20 CeD patients in remission, patients had no worsening of symptom scores and histopathology (60). It is available as a supplement called Gluteguard. Again, more studies would be required to determine its utility inCeD. Also in nascent stages of investigation are other potential glutenasesliketheenzymePseudolysin(IasB)from Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from human fecal microbiota ( 61), the enzyme Nepenthesin from pitcher plants ( 62) and an unknown enzyme from human salivary plaques ( 63). In addition to these, there has been a surge of commercially available dieta ry supplements that claim to aid the digestion of gluten and they are marketed to patients with CeD or to those who prefer to restrict dietary gluten for other reasons. These products ar e mainly glutenases like DPP-IV, which is known to have limite d proteolytic activity. Some of their potential adverse eects, apart from worsening of CeD, include allergy to other components used like egg. None of these products are currently FDA approved( 64). Although all the enzymes described in the preceding sections have been proven glutenase activity under appropriate thermochemical conditions, whether these enzymes complete ly eliminate all immunogenic epitopes and prevent any possible immune-activation by dietary gluten is the most pertinent question. Moreover, most of the glutenases that are now in advancedstagesofclinicaltrials,havebeenstudiedinthec ontext ofsmallamountsofglutenchallenge,inpatientswhoarealre ady on the GFD. Such small challenges simulate inadvertent glute n exposure in patients that adhere to GFD, and are useful to studypatientsthatarenotresponsivedespiteadherencetoGFD . However, the patients who should ideally benet from these medications are those that nd it dicult to adhere to strict GFD or would like to consume near normal levels of gluten in their diet. Whether oral glutenases would help them remains t o be proven. Clinical trials with higher doses of gluten challeng e arerequired. Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease Enzymatically Modied Wheat Gluten Glutenmodicationusingglutenases. Wheat flour can be modied by fermentation with bacteria or fungi. These organisms release proteolytic enzymes that digest gluten, rendering it less toxic, although with modi ed texture of the flour. This flour can then be mixed with other flours like buckwheat, millets, amaranth etc. to restore its viscoelasticproperties. In a study, sourdough lactobacilli were used to ferment wheat. These organisms release proteases that digest the hig hly immunogenic33merpeptidefromgliadin.Thespeciesusedwere L. alimentarius, L. brevis ,L. sanfranciscensis, andL. hilgardii. They were selected previously on the basis of the hydrolytic activities of their enzymes iminopeptidase, dipeptidyl-peptida se prolyl endopeptidase, to digest gluten ( 65). These bacilli were added to sourdough flour made with wheat (30%), non-toxic oats, millet , andbuckwheatandfermentedforaday.Theimpactofingestion of bread made from this flour on intestinal permeability was assessed in CeD patients using the lactulose/rhamnose gluten) made from a similar fermented wheat flour, to CeD patients, did not show any impact on the serological, histological, and immunohistochemical param eters (67). Further studies would be required to prove the safety of fermentedwheatflourinCeDpatients. A few studies have tried to address the issue of palatability of fermented wheat by adding other flours. Heredia-Sandoval et al. showed that addition of Amaranth flour to enzymaticall y pre-digested wheat was found to render it acceptable with good viscoelasticpropertiesandatthesametimelessimmune-reac tive. TheenzymeusedinthisstudywastheglutenaseAN-PEP( 68). Glutenmodicationusingmicrobialtransglutaminase. Another enzymatic approach that has been investigated is the use of microbial transglutaminase (mTG), isolated from Streptoverticillium mobaraensis (69). It is a food grade enzyme and is already extensively used in the food industry to improve the mechanico-chemical properties of food. Unlike the proteolytic enzymes discussed in the preceding sections, it crosslinks gluten molecules in the presence of an amine donor likelysineorlysinemethylester.Ithasthesamesitespeci cityas the human tTG, but in contrast, lacks deamidase activity, an d is not dependent on calcium ( 70). The enzymatic action of mTG has been hypothesized to attenuate the gluten immunogenic epitopes. Some in vitrostudies (71), animal studies and in vivo studies in the intestinal explants from patients with CeD ( 72) have suggested reduction of immunogenicity of gliadin in mT G modiedwheatflour.Inaphasetwoclinicaltrial,sevenpatien ts each with CeD in remission were fed 100g of either enzyme modied wheat rusks or modied wheat alone for 90 days. Less number of patients showed elevation in celiac antibodies (2 v s. 4) and worsening of villous abnormalities (1 vs. 4) in those whowerefedmodiedwheatcomparedtothosefedunmodied wheat(69).Another set of studies have attempted to investigate if the transamidated gluten peptide end products of this enzyme have any immunotoxicity similar to the products of human tTG. For example, Yong et al. showed that the enzyme increases the deamidated end products by 70% when allowed to act on gluten at 40C and neutral pH ( 73). similarresultsaswell( transglutaminaseinCeDisunclear. Thermally Gluten-Gluten Friendly Bread Di et al. ( 75) developed a technology to detoxify wheat gluten proteins using microwaves ( 76). Prior to milling, microwave energy is applied for a few seconds to cleaned, hydrated wheat kernels at 15-18% humidity, to reach a high temperaturewithinashortperiodoftime.Theprocessisrepeate d over several cycles until a temperature of 80-90C and moisture of 13-13.5% in the grains is reached. After this, grains are dried over 24h at room temperature and milled. This process had been proposed to attenuate the immunotoxicity of gluten by 99%, as detected by the R5 monoclonal antibody method, which is a method of detection of gluten immunogenic peptides (77). The bread from this flour was called \"gluten friendly or GLUFR.\" However, a later study found the immunotoxicity of this flour to be unchanged, when checked by the G12 method (another antibody-based gluten immunogenic detection test ), mass proteomics vitroassay with T cells of celiac subjects ( 78). It is possible that microwave therapy causes reconguration of the gluten structure that interfer es with detection of gluten immunogenic peptides by R5 ELISA method.

Approach 2: Intraluminal Sequestration of Gluten Immunogenic Epitopes Polymeric Binders Polymeric binders are used in certain diseases to sequester toxic compounds in the gastrointestinal tract ( 79). They have also found application in CeD, where they act by binding gluten in the gut and preventing their breakdown/ absorption. One is poly form o f P(HEMA- co-SS), called polymer BL-7010, was studied by Liang et al. They demonstrated the mechanism of the sequestration of alpha gliadin by this polymer using spectroscopic and light scattering methods ( 80). This was followed by in vitrostudies that demonstrated no toxic eect of gliadin on cell permeability in the presence of the polymer ( 81).

In order to test practical applicability of industrial grade preparation of the polymer, McCarville and colleagues studied the eectiveness of two batches of BL-7010 together, origina l polymerAandtheindustrialpreparationpolymerB.Thelatteris structurally similar to the original polymer described by Pi nier et al. (81) but has better yield during scaled up industrial preparation. Additional aims were to determine the binding specicitywithgliadinandwithnutrients,toevaluatetheg enetic toxicityin vitro and the safety and systemic absorption of unlabeled BL-7,010 as part of a toxicology study in mice. For the eectiveness study they prepared transgenic mice decient in MHC II, expressing HLA-DQ8. They were initially bred on gluten free diet. They were treated with anti-CD25 antibodi es to deplete CD4 +CD25+Foxp3 cells, which mediate immune tolerance. Then at age 6 weeks onwards they were sensitized with pepsin trypsin digested gliadin and cholera sensitization, mice were administered gluten plus eith er polymer A or polymer B. It was observed that the polymers bind avidly to the gliadin, with no interaction with vitamin s, pepsin, and pancreatin and minimal interaction with albumin. Moreover, systemic absorption was negligible and repeated toxicitystudiesshowedsafetyinthemicemodel.Whilepolyme r Awascompletelyeectiveinabrogatingvillousdamage,polymer Bwasslightlylesseective( 83). Phase 1 human studies were completed in October 2014 (NCT01990885),theresultsofwhichareyettobepublished.T he trial involved 40 celiac adult patients who were well-contro lled after6monthsofadherencetoGFD,andhadnegativeIgA-EMA and IgA-anti tTG antibodies. Escalating, repeated doses of B L- 7010 were administered in addition to gluten in a cross over, placebo controlled RCT. The outcomes planned to be assessed were adverse events and safety parameters, as well as plasma levelsofBL-7010. Polymeric binders may be useful to treat inadvertent or minimal gluten exposure and have a potential role, at the very least,assupportivetherapyinadditiontoGFD.Resultsofhuman trials with dose variations will throw more light on the exte nt to whichtheymaybehelpful. Anti-gluten Antibody Chicken egg yolk may be used to produce antibodies to confer passiveimmunization.IgYisanantibodyharvestedfromthey olk of eggs laid by hens that have been super immunized against gliadin. Gujral et al. showed that these antibodies can be ma de to signicantly neutralize gliadin fraction, in gut- like in vitro conditions.TheyalsodemonstratedthattheseIgYantibodi escan beputintoacapsuleformwith50%mannitol.Thisencapsulated form is called AGY, and it is resistant to degradation in the acidic pH of the stomach. In vitrotesting showed that gliadin absorption was decreased from 42.8 to 0.7% with the addition of AGY. Also, it was found to be more eective in the presence offood(84).AGYwassubsequentlytestedinaphaseonetrialto check safety as well as ecacy in improving symptoms of CeD patients who were persistently symptomatic despite adhering to a GFD. AGY capsules were administered along with meals for 6weeks to the patients. Ten patients completed the study, and no safety concerns were identied. Most patients had fewer celiac symptoms, improved quality of life, lowered antibodies, and lowered lactulose mannitol ratio when taking AGY as compared tothebaselinerun-inperiod( 85). The initial results seem encouraging; although testing on a bigger sample size would be required to conrm its benets. It has minimal toxicity, when administered orally to humans as it does not get absorbed into the systemic circulation to cau se systemic immune activation. However, egg allergy would be a contraindicationforitsuse. Single Chain Fragment Variable Fab is the antigen binding site of an antibody fragment. This Single chain fragment variable (scFv) is a fusion protein tha t contains the Fab sites of the variable and light chains of the antibody. scFv has been explored for therapeutic use in cancer immunotherapy.Itisalsobeingtested invitroforitseectiveness in neutralizing gliadin, for celiac therapy ( 86). The initial step of theantibodyfragmentproductionrequiresinvokinganimmun e reaction in chicken with gliadin. The birds then serve as a source of RNA with the sequence for the scFv ( 87). This scFv sequence is subsequently used to produce recombinant scFV in E. colibacteria in larger amounts. Since two antigen binding regions increase binding anity, two scFv may be joined with a peptide linker to create a tandem scFv (tscFv). This tandem fragment was tested by Eggenreich et al. who found that scFv hadthehighestanityofbindingtodigestedgliadin,follow edby wheat,andspeltflour.Therewasnobindingwithriceandmille t flours, indication specicity of binding 86).

Approach 3: Prevention of Uptake of Gliadin Epitopes Tight junctions are apical, intercellular junctions that reg ulate the passage of molecules via the paracellular transport pathway. In normal conditions, pathogenic bacteria, and dietary anti gens arepreventedfrompassingthroughthetightjunctions.Change s in the paracellular permeability have been hypothesized to be an earlyeventinthepathogenesisofCeD( 88).Immunostimulatory gluten peptides then pass through the paracellular route in such individuals. Human protein zonulin, has been found to be a regulatorofepithelialpermeabilityandishighlyexpressedi nthe mucosa and blood of patients with celiac disease. It is similar t o the zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) expressed by Vibrio cholera e, which tight bindstothechemokinereceptorCXCR3releasingZonulinwhich subsequentlyincreasestheintestinalpermeabilityviatheMy D88 dependentpathway( 28). The transcellular gliadin transport pathway can be exploited for management of CeD. Larazotide acetate, a drugtargetingZonulinhasbeendevelopedbyAlbatherapeutic s, a biopharmaceutical company in USA. Formerly referred to as AT-1001, it is an octapeptide that antagonizes zonulin. Larazotide was found to cause promotion of assembly of actin and E- cadherin around tight junctions of Madin-Darby canin e Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 8 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease kidney (MDCK) type II cells, thus promoting cell junction integrity ( 89). Its eect was studied in vivoin transgenic HLA HCD4/DQ8 mice. These are knock- out mice which with pre-sensitization to gluten ( 90). Larazotide countered the intestinal barrier disintegration, decreased the macropha ge count in the lamina propria, and kept the transmembrane conductance intact, in mice that were given larazotide compared to the mice who were challenged with gliadin withoutlarazotide( 91). Phase 1 trials (NCT00362856) of Larazotide acetate were conductedon24CeDpatientsthatwerechallengedwith2.5gof gluten after being on a GFD for at least 6 months. The results showed that 12mg doses of larazotide decreased the cytokine response and intestinal permeability, as seen using the urina ry LAMA (lactulose to mannitol) extraction fraction, although this dierence was not statistically signicant. The urinary LAMA ratio is an experimental biomarker used to quantify changes i n intestinal permeability in research settings. In CeD, incre ased permeability due to mucosal injury leads to a reduction in absorption of monosaccharides (e.g., mannitol) and an incre ase in the paracellular absorption of disaccharides (e.g., lactu lose). This results in an increase in the ratio of lactulose to mannit ol excreted in urine after oral consumption of an aqueous soluti on oflactuloseandmannitol( 92). Phase 2a study on 86 patients assessed the eect of larazotide on urinary LAMA ratio, the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale, psychological General Well-Being Index as well as adv erse event proling. It was a double blind RCT, testing 4 doses of larazotide acetate- 0.25, 1, 4, and 8mg in patients who had bee n adherent to GFD and negative to EMA and anti-tTG Ab at the baseline. There was no signicant eect of larazotide on the primary ecacy endpoint after gluten challenge which was the LAMAratio.Therewasadenitedecreaseinthegastrointesti nal symptomratingscaleattwodosesof0.25and4mg,butnotinthe other dose groups of 1 and 8mg. Larazotide was generally well- tolerated by patients with the signicant adverse events bei ng headache and urinary tract infections in more than 5% of the patients; however there were no dropouts on account of these events(93). In Phase 2b trials, 1, 4, and 8mg doses of enteric- coated multiparticulate beads of larazotide were given to patients in a placebo controlled study. Results showed no statisticall y signicant dierence in the LAMA levels. The 1mg but not the 4 or 8mg doses of drugs brought a reduction to gastrointestin al symptoms in response to gluten ( 94). In a later phase 2 trial whichtested0.5,1,and2mgdosesoflarazotide(NCT0139621 3), primary end point of reduction of symptoms was met in the 0.25mg dose but not in the higher doses. The pattern that has therefore emerged in all the above studies is that only th e lowerdoseshadaneect,implyinganinverse-doserelationsh ip. Peptide aggregation at higher doses of the drug, reducing activityin vivomay be one of the possible explanations for this observation ( 95). Therefore, in the near future, this drug is expected to be tested in phase 3 trials on 924 patients who have been on GFD, using enteric coated, lower doses of 0.25mg TID and0.5mgTIDfor16weeks(NCT03569007).Approach 4: Tissue Transglutaminase- 2 Inhibition in the Intestinal Mucosa Tissue Transglutaminase Inhibitors Inhibitors of human tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG-2) have been designed to prevent the conversion of gliadin to deamidated gliadin peptides, since the latter possess enhance d immunogenicity as antigens in CeD. tTG-2 is a multi-functio the linkage of glutamine and lysine side-chains to modify proteins, in the presence of ionic calcium and thiol. The enzyme is known to be associated with pathogenesis of not only CeD, but also some cancers ( 96) and, Parkinson's ( 97), Alzheimer's ( 98), and Huntington's diseases (99); hence tTG-2 inhibitors are being tested in many of the aforementionedconditions. Three broad varieties of tTG-2 inhibitors have been well- describedsofar,namelycompetitiveamineinhibitors,reve rsible inhibitors, and irreversible Competitive natural amine available tTG-2 inhibitor, mercaptam ine or cystamine, has not been explored for its potential role in CeD(100,101). Reversible inhibitors inhibit substrate access to the active site without covalently modifying the tTG-2 enzyme. Examples in this class and their analogs, GTP- S,- methyl GTP, ionic zinc, as well recently discovered drugs with thieno [2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one acyl hydrazidebackbone( 102). The third covalently bi nd to the cysteine in the active site and block the transglutaminas e enzyme. Examples include iodoacetamide ( 103), -diazo-5-oxo- norleucine(DON)( 104)and3-halo-4,5-dihydroisoxazoles( 105). The latter two compounds are based on the structure of acivicin, a natural analog of gliadin. Among all the above compounds, the dihydroisoxazoles and DON are selective for tTG-2 inhibition, with Ac-PQP-(DON)-LPF-NH being the most potent and selective. Also, it has been found that the 5- (S)-dihydroisoxazole is a markedly better inhibitor of hum an tTG-2 than its 5-(R) stereoisomer in vitro(106). A prototype dihydroisoxazole called 1 b, showed good oral bioavailabil ity, ecient tTG-2 inhibition in small intestinal tissue, and lo w toxicity in animal studies ( 105). KCC009 is a dihydroisoxazole that has been studied for its application in cancers ( 107,108). Other examples of dihydroisoxazole are ERW1041E ( 109) and R294(110). Also, several gluten- mimetic peptides have been developed with DON. They have a gliadin peptide sequence, as well. These three compound s covalently bind to active site cysteine of tTG-2 ( 112). Among Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease these, the ZED1227 has been studied in phase 1 trials. Reports suggestthatitissafeandalsodecreasestheactivityoftTG -2and inflammation of bowel mucosa in mice models ( 113). Recently plans for phase 2a trial (EUDRA CT No. 2017-002241-30) were announcedbyZedirapharmaceuticals. The guiding principle in the applicability of the above inhibitors is that they should attain in the lamina propria, a sucient concentration without inhibition of other member s of the transglutaminase family. Theoretically, the inhibi tion of tTG-2 can result in cross inhibition of other members of the transglutaminase family, several of which are indispensabl e for pathways like the coagulation cascade and the maintenance of epidermal integrity. Some studies suggest that transgeni c mice with tTG knockout develop autoimmune diseases like glomerulonephritis ( 112). Since some gluten peptides are potentially immunogenic even without deamidation by tTG, combining tTG inhibitors with other pharmaceutical agents that eliminate immunogenic peptides before they enter lamina propriawouldbelogical. Si RNA Based Therapy Si- RNA contained in gelatin based nanoparticles have been testedin vitroon intestinal epithelial (Caco-2 or the continuous cell line of human colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells. These silencing RNA molecules target human tTG-2 and IL-15, both of which are incriminated in CeD pathogenesis. In a study, fluorescentmicroscopyrevealedthatthesesphericalparticle sare rapidly internalized within 2h and localize themselves to th e cytoplasm. A 60% reduction in the gene products of tTG-2 and IL-15 genes was noticed 72h after administration, which in t urn translated into reduction in IFN- and TNF- levels (114). Si- RNA appears to be a promising tool, although the eects of IL- 15 suppression and suppression of other glutaminases may be a cause of concern. Regardless, this approach may be emulated to blockotherspecictargetsintheCeDpathogenesisinthefutu re aswell. Approach 5: Prevention of Downstream Immune Activation After Gluten Exposure HLA Blockers HLA blockers prevent the interaction of antigen presenting cells (APC) that process and present gluten immunogenic epitopes using their MHC-II ligands which are a part of the HLA system, to the T Cell Receptor (TCR) of CD4 +T helper cells. This amounts to prevention of an immunotoxic cascade that is a part of adaptive immunity in CeD. Cyclic peptides have been designed for blocking the gliadin binding groove of HLA-DQ2. These peptides are structurally similar to gliadin and compete with it to bind HLA-DQ2. These have the gliadin like epitopes-LQPFPQPELPY, KQPFPEKELPY, or LQLQPFPQPEKPYPQPEKPY are cyclized using sulde or polyethylene glycol bridges. Cyclization of these peptides re sults in eective blockade of the HLA grooves. Similarly, dimeric peptides with gliadin scaolds have also demonstrated eective blockade. However, it has not translated into reduced T cell activation ( 115). Furthermore, ubiquitous requirement of HLA in various immune responses and a potential interference by th epeptides in that function is one of the main concerns of use of HLAblockers. Vaccines and Tolerogenic Therapies The gluten products, upon entering lamina propria are recognized as immunogenic, and this triggers an adaptive immune response. Tolerogenic therapies using vaccines have beendevelopedtohypo-sensitizetheadaptiveimmunity. Vaccinetherapy Hyposensitization is a well-known therapy for allergic disease s and is a potential therapeutic approach in autoimmune diseases aswell.Inadeparturefromtheirtraditionaluseofimmunizat ion, vaccines are now being tested for desensitization. Examples of the latter include dendritic cell therapy in multiple sclerosis an d in the case of Ced, the peptide-based vaccine called NexVax2. It was developed by a US based company, ImmunoSanT, Inc. NexVax2 is composed of three proprietary, immunodominant gliadin peptides named NPL001, NPL002, and NPL003 each of which is 15-16 amino acid long. The vaccine target is the HLA- DQ2.5-epitope-TCR complex linking the antigen presenting cell tothegluten-reactiveCD4 +Tcells. It engages specic immune cells and a signature pathway has been discovered based on that. In animal studies in HLA- DQ2.5 transgenic mice having gluten-sensitive T cells, it was found to be ecacious ( 116). In a phase 1a study, gluten-related gastrointestinal side eect s, dose escalation could be completed, and safety was acceptable ( 117). Similarly in phase 1 b study, gradual dose escalation of up to 900\u00b5g was tolerated well ( 118). Vaccinated subjects showed the target T cells becoming functionally unresponsive to antige nic stimulation with gluten challenge, consistent with immune tolerance. Nexvax2 was also associated with trends toward improvedduodenalmucosalhistology.Plasmaconcentrations of Nexvax2peptidesweredose-dependent( 119). Currently a phase 2, quadruple blind RCT (NCT03644069) is underway that will test 32 doses of twice weekly subcutaneous administration of this vaccine in subjects over a 16 week peri od. ItwilltesttheecacyandimprovementinCeDpatientreported outcomescore,aswellthesafety,withafollowupof4weekspo st administrationofthelastdose. epitopes. Other aspects,suchasecacyandlong-termsafety,aretobeestabl ished before peptide vaccines are made available for the management of CeD. Also, the eect prole in pediatric age group remains to beestablished.However,ifsuccessful,ithasthepotential tohave prolongedbenetsonpatients. Oralgliadinbasedtolerogenesis Another way of inducing immune tolerogenesis, is the use of oral agents that act locally in the gut. Lactobacillus lactis has been engineered to release modied, non-toxic gliadin. A genetically engineered form of this non-colonizing, non- pathogenic bacterium was orally administered to secrete a Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease deamidated epitope transgenic NOD-2 mice with ABoDQ8 haplotype. This induced suppression of the T-cell +Tregs propria. These ndings suggest development of mucosaltolerancetothegliadin( 120). Similarly a study used Bacillus subtilis spores as a long-lived, protease-resistant adjuvant system for administering glia din peptides The spore-adsorbed gliadin activatedthe dendritic cells andeliciteda T-cell response in the gut. This mechanism ( 121) can be utilized for developing immunetolerance. Tolerogenicimmunomodulatorypeptides. Tolerogenic immunomodulatory peptides (TIMPs) are nano be used to deliver peptide epitopes intravenously to induce systemic immune tolerance. Gliadin containingTIMPshasshownfavorableresultsinasingleanima l study (122). A drug called TIMP-GLIA (Cours pharmaceuticals) has been developed along these lines, having acquired a fast track approval from the FDA for phase 1 testing. The results of phase 1 trial are yet to be published, and the phase 2 trial is currentlyunderway. Cathepsin specically in antigenpresentingcells(APCs)whereitmediatestheproteol ysis of the invariant chain. Invariant an pr otein that prevents intracytoplasmic, self- antigen loading durin g the early stages of development of the MHC-II molecules of APCs. Once the MHC-II complex matures intracellularly, cathepsin S cleaves The cathepsin inhibitor, RO5459072 (also called RG7625), has been developed to target this pathway and is being tested in CeD, Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune diseases. A study (NCT022953320) showed that this drug resulted in a decrease in maturation of MHC-II bearing B cells and dendriti c cells (124). The eects of RO5459072 on the immune response to gluten challenge in CeD patients has been investigated in a phase 1, placebo-controlled RCT (NCT02679014). Volunteers with previously diagnosed CeD were randomized to receive either 100mg of RO5459072 or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Theresultsofthestudyareawaited.Anothercathepsininhib itor inthepipelineisRG7236. Immunosuppressants CeD is similar to inflammatory bowel disease in being a chroni c inflammatory condition with a similar prole of inflammatory chemicalmediators.AmajordierenceisthatinCeD,abrogat ion of immune cascade occurs with GFD, IBD on the other hand requireslifelongimmunosuppression.However,asubsetofCe D patients require immunosuppression as an adjunct to GFDto enhance their recovery; these are patients suering from refractoryCeD,celiaccrisis,andgliadinshock.Thefollow ingare some of anti-inflammatory and immune modulating drugs arebeinginvestigatedinthecontextofCeD. Glucocorticoids EarlyhistoricreportsontheinhibitoryeectofsteroidsonBa nd T cell proliferation and on release of lymphokines by cultured cells based on in vitrostudies, indicated that steroids may be eective in CeD ( 125). Wall et al. then showed an accelerated improvement in symptoms by addition of prednisone to GFD in patients with CeD ( 126). In another in vitrostudy, Mitchison et al. had also demonstrated the preventive eects of fluticaso ne propionateontheimmunotoxicityofgluten( 127). Amongthelaterstudies,aproofofconceptRCTevaluatedthe eects of a short course of prednisolone along with GFD on the markers of apoptosis and anti-apoptosis pathways, as well as on epithelial cell regeneration in treatment na\u00efve CeD patients. The hypothesis was that addition of prednisolone for a short term, would accentuate the mucosal recovery. A 4 week course of 1 mg/kg/dprednisoloneinadditiontoGFDwasgiventotreatmen t na\u00efve CeD patients. It was found that compared to baseline, patients on both GFD alone control group as well as the GFD plus prednisolone group had underexpression of the markers of apoptosis viz. p53 and M30. However, all apoptotic markers other than H2AX showed a rebound increase 4 weeks after cessation of steroids, indicating that steroids may have in deed played a role in suppressing apoptosis and epithelial injury, duringtheperiodwherethesteroidwasavailableinthesyste mic circulation. The study also found that steroids could howeve r counterproductively lead to a suppression of proliferation ind ex andthereforeofepithelialregeneration( 128). More recently, budesonide has piqued the interest of researchers in view of its potential application as a steroid wit h low systemic bioavailability and hence higher eect on the gu t. Ciacci et al. studied the eect of oral administration of 6mg budesonide capsules for 4 weeks on CeD patients on GFD. It was found that the drug signicantly decreased stool freque ncy andstoolweightandimprovedgeneralwell-beingasindicated by subjectsonaVisualAnalogScale,incomparisontothoseonGFD alone. The same study also investigated the eect of budesoni de invitroonintestinalepithelialcellsfrombiopsiesofCeDpatients, exposed to gliadin and its toxic fraction p21-43. Budesonide signicantly decreased the expression of inflammatory marke rs ICAM-1,COX-2,andHLA-DR( 129). SteroidsinrefractoryCeD Brar et al. studied retrospectively, 30 CeD patients who were prescribed budesonide while following up for symptoms that were refractory despite maintaining adherence to GFD. They noticed, that 75% of patients had at least partial response to budesonide \u00b1either azathioprine or systemic steroids, and 55% responded completely. Complete response was higher among those with secondary refractory CeD i.e., in those whose disea se manifestations recurred after an initial response to a GFD, compared to those whose disease remained refractory from the timeofinstitutionoftheGFD(primaryrefractoryCeD)( 130). Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease In another recent series, Mukewar et al. showed clinical (92%) and histologic (89%) improvement in 57 patients with refractory CeD who were treated with oral budesonide. Half o f these patients had earlier been treated with immunosuppressiv e therapy with no or incomplete response. Follow-up biopsy in 7 outof13patientswithrefractoryCeD-2(RCD-2)(53%)showed an absence of clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement/aberrant IEL phenotype that was previously seen ( 131). Similar response wasalsoreportedbyDauminpatientswithrefractoryCeD( 132). Stemcelltherapy Intestinal epithelial cells in the crypts and villi are in a state of continuous turnover with stem cells from the base of crypts proliferating, dierentiating into mature phenotypes and rising to the outer villous surface to replenish the older cells that are shed. These stem cells are identied by the markers CD133 +/Lgr5+. There have been case reports of using hematopoieticautologousstemcelltransplantbeingsuccessf ully used to treat the enteropathy of CeD patients ( 133). Autologous stemcelltransplanthasbeentriedinpatientswithrefractor yCeD as well. In a pilot study, 13 patients with refractory CeD were subjected to ASCT, it was found that not only was tedfor atleast2yearsinpatients( 134).Furthermore,inaseriesamongst 54patientswhohadbeendiagnosedwithenteropathyassociate 1994 to 1998, 14 underwent ASCT. All of them showed disappearance of intestinal lesions as well as prolonged remission of the disease ( 135). However, occurrence of neutropenia and other complications of stem cell transplant arelikelytoaecttheacceptabilityofthistherapyexceptinso me refractorycases. CCR9antagonists In order for immunoreactive T cells to home in to the intestinal mucosa and cause celiac autoimmunity, they use their ligand called CCR9 to bind with the receptor CCL25 on the intestinal mucosal epithelium. Antagonists to CCR9 developed, e.g., CCX8037 and GSK-1605786 (CCX-282; Tracet-EN, Vercirnon). The latter is a drug that is being developed for potential use in Crohn's disease and CeD. This molecule was characterized and tested in vitro by Walters et al. on Molt-4-T cell lines which endogenously express CCR9. Stimulation of Molt-4 cells with CCL25 resulted in release of intracellular ionic calcium which in turn promote d chemotaxis. Also, CCL25 is a chemoreceptor specic to intestinal mucosa. antagonist CCL25 prevented the interaction of chemokines CCL25 and CCR9, and prevented release of calcium and homing- in of inflammatory T cells. The same study also found the results to be replicable in mouse models where intestinal inflammation was attenuated in response to the drug. Furthermore, the drug CCX282 was found to be highly selective for CCL25-CCR9 interaction ( 136). Tubo et al. have also tested this drug in mouse models and found similar results. Interestingly they also inoculat ed this drug into inflamed ear skin in mice, and found no attenuation of inflammatory response in the draining lymph nodes showing that this drug would specically act in theimmune system of the intestine and spare other immune organs(137). ARCT(NCT00540657)tostudytheecacyofadministration of 250mg of oral CCX282 twice daily in comparison to placebo hasbeencompletedinpatientswithCeDon24months ofGFD. TheoutcomemeasuresincludedeectsonV:Cratioandmarkers of intestinal inflammation, serology overexpressed the intestinal mucosa in CeD on exposure to gluten. It mediates the inflammatory response that leads to intestinal epithelial damage. Humanized Mik-Beta-1 monoclonal antibody has been developed to target IL-2/IL-15 R Beta(CD122).Hu-Mik-Beta-1iscurrentlybeinginvestigate dfor safety in phase 1 trials in a three dose regimen (Day 1, week 3, week6)inrefractoryCeDpatients. Another human monoclonal antibody against IL-15, with a similar mechanism of action is AMG 714 ( 140). This drug has been developed by the biotechnology company, Amgen. It is being investigated in phase 2, double blind placebo controlle d, dose-varyingRCT. Integrinantagonists. Vedolizumabisahumanizedmonoclonalantibodythatprevent s the addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1). The latter is found exclusively on the intestinal mucosa, enabling vedolizumab to prevent chemotaxis of memory T cells into the mucosa from the circulation. This specic chemotaxis directed towa rd mucosa or homing- in of T cells is responsible for the chronic inflammation seen in IBD. Vedolizumab is therefore used for the management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerativ e colitis. Similar to IBD, there is an overexpression of 47 integrin in patients with CeD and hence its eect in CeD is worth exploring. Vedolizumab is under a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02929316) in CeD patients, with results expected in2019. ImmunomodulatordrugswithpotentialapplicationinCeD Other potential immunomodulators include anti- TNF- agents like infliximab. Infliximab has been shown to be useful in case reports of refractory CeD ( 141,142), however a larger human trial is yet to be done. Similarly natalizumab has also been tried in patients with multiple sclerosis or IBD in addition to CeD (143), with induction of remission in both CeD and the co-occurringcondition. Mulderetal.studiedtheuseofrecombinantIL-10fortreating patients with refractory CeD and found that only 2 of the 10 treatedpatientsrespondedhistologically( 144).Anotherpotential immunomodulator is the anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab. Whi le it is worth exploring the use of this agent in CeD to abrogate the abnormal mucosal plasmablasts and antibody formation, a Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 12 May 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 193Yoosuf and Makharia Evolving Therapy for Celiac Disease study found no signicant eect of rituximab on mucosal B cells(145). Other Therapies Under Investigation Besides the ve approaches discussed in the preceding sections , there are a few experimental therapies that modulate factors known to be associated with CeD but as yet are not known to play an obvious role in its pathogenesis. These therapies include probiotics and prebiotics, the low FODMAP pancreatic enzyme supplements, and helminth therapy using hookworms. Probiotics have been tried in patients with CeD, since studies have found a reduction in the relative proportio n of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bidobacterium and a relat ive increase in Bacteroides and E.Coli in CeD patients compared to controls. A few RCTs have found that probiotics lead to improvement in symptoms in CeD ( 146) while some animal studies have found Bidobacterium andLactobacillus to reduce gluten-induced toxicity. The proprietary probiotic formulat ion VSL#3 has demonstrated activity in gliadin pre-digestion in a study (147). Similarly, a study found that oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), a prebiotic, increased the Bidobacteri um count in the gut signicantly, with no side eects ( 148). These ndings point to a possible causative role of gut dysbiosis in CeD, although the exact mechanism remains obscure. Studies are also exploring the use of low FODMAP (Fermentable oligo-, di-, mono- saccharides, and polyols) diet, which is low in sho rt chain polysaccharides like fructans, lactose, mannitol, so rbitol etc. These sugars are hard to digest, resulting in fermentat ion in the bowel and flatulence, and are implicated in causing some of the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) (149). The low FODMAP diet may therefore be benecial in CeD, especially in those with functional IBS like ( 150- 152) symptoms. One limitation of this diet is that it is even more restrictive than GFD and can increase susceptibility to nutritional deciencies. It is also noteworthy that much of the evidence concerning the use of low FODMAP diet is derived from moderate to low quality studies in IBS patients where proper blinding and controls have not been used, with uncertainty over whether the benet of the diet is a placebo eect (153). In another experimental approach, Weiss tested the hygienehypothesisofautoimmunitybyinvestigatingtheeec tof hookworm (Necator americanus) therapy on CeD. The hygiene hypothesis has been derived from the observation that there has been a simultaneous decrease in infectious diseases and an increase in autoimmune diseases globally ( 154). Chronic low grade helminthiasis, while inducing specic immune response to itself, also diminishes Th1 cells response to other antige ns (155), which can in turn suppress autoimmunity. Daveson found that inoculation of hookworms into the skin increased microbial richness in the fecal samples in the same patients. It is possible therefore that helminthic infection modulates CeD pathogenesis through an unknown mechanism that could be similar to probiotics ( 156-159). Furthermore, they found hookworm therapy to be safe and well-tolerated with none of the patients developing signicant anemia. Administratio n of pancreatic enzyme supplements may also be helpful in asubset of CeD patients classied as having Non Responsive Celiac Disease or NRCD (persisting symptoms of CeD despite 6-12 months of adhering to a GFD). This is because exocrine pancreatic insuciency may be one of the factors known to contribute to NRCD symptoms, other factors being microscopic colitis, refractory CeD, dietary lactose/fructose malabso rption and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( 147). A RCT is currently underway to test the eect of pancreatic enzyme supplementationinNRCDpatients(NCT02475369). CONCLUSIONS GFD is likely to remain the mainstay of therapy of CeD in the near future, since all other treatment modalities are on ly in the preliminary stages of research. An ideal therapeutic agent would be one that permits a CeD patient to consume gluten in usual amounts, without compromising her/his quality of life. So far, only vaccines have come closest to the potential of helping patients achieve that ideal state. Vaccines also show promise i n terms of bearing prolonged benets, subverting the need for gluten restriction all together. Glutenases are another gr oup of drugs that have been extensively explored as therapeutic agen ts and their list is growing with newer discoveries. Among thes e, latiglutenase had reached the farthest in terms of clinical t rials; although the most recent clinical trial on a large sample size delivered disappointing results. Results of preliminary studies on another glutenase, Kuma030, suggest that this enzyme may hold more promise in future, compared to other glutenases studied so far. Similarly, large scale testing of the zonuli n antagonist, larazotide acetate with lower doses could yield new insights into its eectiveness, due to results of previous sma ller studies demonstrating an inverse dose- response relationsh ip. To conclude, although most trials on novel therapeutics are currently in phase 2 or earlier stages, ongoing research in are as targeting various molecular pathways in CeD is robust. This leaves much scope to nd denitive alternatives to GFD in the years to come, in order to improve the quality of life of patient s withCeD.
