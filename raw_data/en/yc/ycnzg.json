It allows you to connect with like-minded individuals and helps you feel supported in your health and wellness journey. Below you'll find my top 20 whole food plant-based blogs and social media accounts that are an endless source of inspiration for whole food, plant-based recipes and living with intention. I should preface by saying plant-based does not mean vegan. However, many of these blogs are fully vegan. If you're wondering what plant-based means here as Nourished by Nutrition, check out [this post.](http://jbippen.wpengine.com/plant-based-diet/) While each of these blogs are wonderfully unique, they all have a common mission of sharing whole-food, plant-centric recipes in an effort to help inspire you to eat well and cook more. Each of these ladies has an unwavering way with ingredients and flavor combinations. Most of the recipes they share are simple and perfect for meal prepping or weeknight meals. The recipes that are a tad more complicated feel extremely approachable as they walk you through the steps while providing a reason for the process. Not only do these ladies have incredible recipes but they all have exceptional photography skills. Since we eat without eyes first, it's imperative that each recipe has equally beautiful photographs to entice and inspire especially when first transitioning to more plant-based foods. And these ladies have it mastered! Faring Well (now Jessie May) Blogging from sunny Costa Mesa, CA, Jessie shares whole food, vegan recipes and to-die-for wholesome treats.
