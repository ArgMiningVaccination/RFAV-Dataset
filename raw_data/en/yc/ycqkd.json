Under a microscope one finds separation of closely connected cells in the skin's outer layers (acantholysis) that can be identified by a dermatologist. Small blisters containing a watery liquid are present. These blisters tend to group and have a swollen red border around them. Grover's disease is mainly seen in males over the age of fourty. It's cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to trauma to sun damaged skin. History of Grover's Disease : Ralph Grover, a dermatologist from New York, first reported the effects of this condition in 1970. He found that the most cases lasted six to twelve months (hence the word \"transient\"). Unfortunately for some, it lasted longer. Most people with this condition get red, itchy spots, while others get blisters. This main symptom is also called \"Grover's rash.\" Symptoms : The main symptoms of Grover's disease are: Symptoms usually last about 6 to 12 months, but may go away sooner or take longer to disappear. Causes : The cause of Grover's disease is unknown. Some doctors think that sun-damaged skin or extreme changes in temperature play a role. One popular, but unproven, theory is that it may be linked to sweating. Grover's disease cases have occurred in men who use warming items or equipment such as hot tubs, steam rooms, and electric blankets, among others. It can also be caused by certain medications, organ transplants, kidney disease, dialysis, or x-ray exposure. Ayurvedic View and Treatment options : According to Ayurveda, Grover's disease is caused by toxins that are generated by imbalances in the blood, lungs, and liver. Skin-disrupting toxins arise from excess rakta dhatu (blood tissue), which with rasa dhatu (plasma) nourishes the skin. Rakta dhatu becomes imbalanced when we ingest heating foods, imbibe alcohol or other liver irritants, endure intense sun exposure, work excessively, or experience intense negative emotions\u2014anything, in short, that has the attributes of the pitta dosha. Not surprisingly, pitta-dominant individuals experience more skin diseases than vatas or kaphas, if only because pitta tends to overheat the blood.
