Is this for real, and if so how can we get through it healthy, sane and morally intact? The experts keep telling us NOT TO PANIC, to listen to reason, and to stand together as a united humanity, and you know what? I think we can do it! We will get through this by digging deep, caring for our fellow man and being informed!!! And we have a hidden ally that we don't even pay attention to most of the time....The Immune System. Your immune system is your body's version of the army during tough times: determined to defend against everything that threatens it's country, both foreign and domestic made up of some really interesting soldiers, including the skin, mucus, gut and lymph system, to help make this possible. The main purpose of your immune system is to protect your body from viruses, bacteria, disease and infection, or to help you recover after an accident or injury. Without it infection or injury would run rampant and you'd be constantly falling ill. Your immune system helps to destroy anything that could be potentially harmful to your life and well- being. A strong and healthy immune system helps you go about your every day life as you come into contact with germs and bugs from pets, people, and your environment. Without a healthy immune system, you could pick up infections and infectious diseases very easily, with the effect possibly being very serious - even fatal!!! It's easy to take the immune system for granted because it does such a good job, usually effortlessly, at keeping us free from infection all day every day without us even thinking about it! If you've got a healthy immune system, look after it and it will look after you. And now more than ever in the face of the Coronavirus Pandemic its important to keep our Immune system in tip top condition. But how can you help your immune system? It's extremely important that your immune system is working well if you want to stay as protected as possible. There are many ways you can do this by adhering to basic but important lifestyle behaviours. Most importantly at this time, practise good hygiene! Wash your hands with soap and warm water or hand sanitizer often, and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow! Other things you can do for your immune system are to eat healthily, cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink, regular exercise, reduce stress levels (If you live a hectic life, slowing down and resting can make a huge difference). Taking vitamins and supplements suggested by your health practitioner, and improving your quality of life spiritually and mentally can have a huge impact and healing effect on the immune system.There are many beautiful God given Crystals that can help to strengthen and protect this important line of defence.. and Rocky Road Minerals are bringing them to you.... Clear Quartz is thought of as the Master Healer and can be used for any condition. It is the most powerful healing & energy amplifier on the planet. Clear Quartz is believed to bring balance to the entire body by stimulating the immune system. Calcite, (especially green calcite) also strengthens the immune system. It is wonderful for helping the body to absorb calcium, and so is especially helpful for young, growing, children and people with bone ailments. You are what you eat: Diet has an important part to play in all areas of health and is especially helpful to the immune system. If at all possible try to eat some immune-boosting fruits and vegetables like citrus fruits, broccoli, garlic, ginger, spinach, yogurt and almonds every day either in your daily meals or as delicious drinks and smoothies. Sleep now or forever hold your peace Have you been running around like crazy, burning the candle at both ends and suddenly find yourself sick? That's your immune system getting its revenge. STOP! Rest and relax more often - If you're over stressed and not getting more than five hours of sleep a night, your immune system will be put on overdrive and can become depressed, just like you. This leaves you open to colds, flu, and infection. Amethyst, is a wonderful meditation stone which can help to promote calm, balance, and peace. Amethyst helps the body's organs to self cleanse and eliminate impurities by stimulating the immune system bringing the body into balance. Stress damages your immune system Your immune system is ready for anything you can throw at it. But it can only handle so much. If a person is chronically stressed, overworked and anxious, stress hormones can affect the way the body functions over time. This increases your risk of serious health problems, including: Anxiety / depression / digestive issues / heart disease / sleep disorders / weight gain /problems with memory and concentration. All of which reduce effectiveness of the immune system making us vulnerable to illness of all kinds. Aquamarine helps to get rid of fluid retention, balances hormones and strengthens the immune system. Aquamarine is linked to the throat Chakra and is known to help and ease any problems or ailments and can help to bring healing to this area. It is a great crystal to use when meditating bringing calm and peace to the body. It heals emotional trauma, helps with anger and conflict, clears the mind and brings peace and calms the heart! It's important to find healthy, practical ways to deal with your stress. This will decrease your risk of long-term stress and its related health problems. Some good ways to reduce stress include: Meditation / good sleeping habits / yoga / acupuncture / talk therapy / art therapy / exercise / eating healthfully and laughter..... Laughter helps your immune system Laughter really can be the best medicine. It releases dopamine and other feel-good chemicals in the brain, all of which can help decrease stress. \"Twenty minutes of laughter a day may not keep the doctor away, but it may help keep your immune system working properly\" Another wonderful theory is that spirituality can affect immune-system function. Believe it or not Spirituality, faith, church attendance, prayer and meditation can improve immune function in ways that CAN be measured, like documented increases in white blood cells! Chalcedony helps to absorb negative energy and brings the mind, body, emotions and spirit into harmony. It is a powerful cleanser that enhances the immune system. It has a wonderful anti-inflammatory effect and improves the absorption of minerals, blood circulation, lymph flow, and boosts all round energy. During the next few days, weeks and months, we at Rocky Road Minerals wish you, your loved ones, friends and family all the health, happiness, peace of mind and strength to get you though these dark days. Remember that human sunshine still exists..... When this is over, may we never again take for granted a handshake with a stranger, full shelves at the store, conversations with neighbours, a crowded theatre. Friday night out, the taste of communion, a routine check-up, the school rush each morning. Coffee with a friend, the stadium roaring. Each deep breath! A boring Tuesday, life itself! When this ends, may we find that we have become more like the people we wanted to be, we were called to be, we hoped to be. And may we stay that way - better for each other, because of the worst.
