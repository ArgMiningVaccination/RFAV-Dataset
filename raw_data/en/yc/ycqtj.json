Targeting Pregnant Women Wrap-Up: NIIW/TIM 2015 New Infant Pertussis Story on Shot by Shot Governor Signs SB277 into Law On June 30, Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 277 (Pan). Effective one year from now, in July 2016 , SB 277 will eliminate personal and religiou s exemptions from immunization requirements fo r children in child care and publi c and private schools. The law will also allow personal belief exemptions (PBEs) submitted before January 1, 2016 to remain valid until a pupil reaches Kindergarten or 7th grade. The following exemp t categories will no t have to meet existing immunization requirem ents for entry: Home-based private schools Students enrolled in an independent study program who do not receive classroom-based instruction Special education services specified in an individualized education program. Note: Students in the above categories will still need to provide immunization records to their schools before entry, and schools will still need to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) the immunization status of all students at the existing checkpoints of child care, kindergarten, and 7th grade. In addition, the law allows medical and personal beliefs exemptions from any new immunization requirement initiated by CDPH for school and child care attendance. For more details, read the text of SB 277 and the Governor's signing message . Further information about the implementation of SB 277 will become available by 2016.

The preferred age for MenB vaccination is 16 - 18 years. \" The wording designates the recommendation as \"Category B (permissive)\" rather than routine. Health care providers and patients will decide on an individual basis whether to use the vaccine. Category B recommendations are covered with no cost-sharing by the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) and most private health plans. VFC participants ages 16 - 18 will be eligible for the MenB vaccines. California VFC providers can expect further guidance on vaccine availability and ordering from the VFC program after the recommendations have been published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR); ACIP recommendations are official once published in the MMWR. Two M enB vaccines are av ailable in the US . Bexsero \u00ae is given in a two-dose series and Trumen ba\u00ae is given in three doses. The ACIP recommended the same product for all doses of the series, with no preference of one product over the other. Both are approved for ages 10-25 years but may be given to high-risk persons older than 25 years. Th e ACIP voted in Febru ary to recommend MenB vaccines in people older than 10 years who have a specifi c increased risk for meningococcal group B disease . Read MMWR Jun e 12, 2015 . VFC will cov er MenB vaccines for ages 10-18 for tho se meeting high-risk criteria. In addition , MenB vaccines will b e covered by private insur ers based on Affordable Care Act guidelines. ACIP - One Year or More Between PCV13 and PPSV23 for Adults Age 65+ ACIP also extended the recommended interval for adults 65 years and older receiving the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine \u00ae) to one year, regardless of sequen ce. The previously recommended interval had been 6 -12 months. One dose of PCV13 and one dose of PPSV23 are covered by Medicare Part B if separated by at least one year. Statewide Immunization Campaigns IZ Branch Sponsors Radio Spots Targeting Pregnant Women During June, the Immunization Branch sponsored radio spots in English and Spanish promoting maternal Tdap vaccination and the Text4Baby program . Pregnant women who sign up for Text4Baby receive reminders in their third trimester encouraging them to talk to their doctor about Tdap vaccine. Given the higher risk of severe pertussis in Latino infants, the spots were broadcast in areas with the greatest number of pertussis cases or large Latino populations, including San Diego, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Fresno, Modesto, Riverside-San Bernardino, Stockton, and Visalia-Tulare. 3 Get Ready for NIAM!

The se schools may be more vulnerable to disease exposure and outbreaks. In order to promote complian ce with immunization requirements, beginning in 2015-16, public schools (7th grade and Kindergarten) that do not submit immunization assessment reports or Kindergartens that have conditional admission rates above 25% (i.e., hav e stud ents no t cur rently due for immunizations but have doses due later) for the 2015-16 school year will have their immunization documentation audited as p art o f their annual financial and compliance audit by the Stat e Controller's Office. To avoid the potential auditing or audit finding, schools are reminded that Kindergarten assessment reports are due at Shotsfor School.org by October 15, and Grade 7 immunization reports are due by November 1. Plan ahead to ensu re that all conditionally adm itted students are accurately reported and that prop er follow-up procedu res are in place. New Online Blue Book Coming! The California Immunization Handbook, commonly referred to as the \"Blue Book, \" is being updated! The 8th Edition of the Blue Book will be released on ShotsforSchool.org by this fall. Along with the new edition, CDPH is developing a PowerPoint presentation that local health jurisdictions can use to train school staff on immunization requirements before fall registration. The training will help local health jurisdictions and schools understa nd: school and child care immunization requirements compliance, including personal belief exemptions and conditional entrants assessments, reporting, and more! Also available later this summer, the Guide to the Requirements of the California School Immunization Law for Parents (IMM-222) is being updated and will include two versions: child care and school. GreatSchools.org to Collaborate with IZ Branch GreatSchools.org is a leading national source of school information - you may have seen it integrated with real estate sites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com. To help parents with their school choice decisions, starting in early 2016, GreatSchools.org will begin including immunization rate information in school profiles. With approximately seven million unique visitors to the site from California each year, the partnership will allow more families to see important immunization rate data as they research schools! 6 CAIR News CAIR Upgrades Performance High numbers of electronic transmissions coming into the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) slow ed performance for the Bay Area and Los Angeles/Orange County regions. To address the delay, CAIR revised its import algorithms and weekend and evening schedules. All CAIR regions are now adding electronic records within 24 hours of receipt. The CAIR tech team also moved the Bay Area registry onto new equipment, allowing live data to be synchronized on a new server . This process will be repeated with the Los Angeles/Orange County registry this summer . The remainder of the CAIR regions are smaller and can be easily transition ed, as needed. The CAIR team thanks Catharine Ratto and her staff in Alameda County for testing to ensure data transitioned to the new servers. Provider Education Communication with Vaccine-Hesitant Parents In a recent poll of parents, 28% had concerns about vaccinations, primarily side effects (36%) and fear that vaccines would cause illness (27%). Abou t 91% indicated that all children attending public schools should be required to get recommended vaccinations. Howev er, that fell to 83% suppo rt for requiring school vaccination s for any school, including private schools. Read more . A recent study of a physician communication strategy failed to reduce parental vaccine hesitancy. A related commentary suggests: using a \"presumptive \" approach to vaccination, building a trusting and satisfying relationship with the parent, and allowing ample time for questions. Getting Ready for HPV9 Human papillomaviru s nine-valent vaccine (HPV9, trade name Gardasil \u00ae 9) is available now through the online ordering system MyVFCVaccines. VFC providers were notified in June about ordering vaccines. Phone the VFC central office for further questions. Per federal recommendations and policy, HPV9 may be used to immunize both females and males 9 years or older, even when beyond their FDA- licensed ag es and indications ('off -label'). Any human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine product (HPV2, HPV4, or HPV9) may be used for females when providers do not know which vaccine was previously received, do not have all formulations available, or are transitioning to HPV9 and have remaining inventory. For males, HPV9 may be used to complete the series if HPV4 was administered for preceding doses.7 Patients More likely to Get HPV Vaccinations After EHR Prompts Clinics that used an electronic health record (EHR) to flag patient due dates for human papillomavirus (HPV) initiation, and doses two and three were six times more likely to have adolescents and young adults start the HPV series and eight times more likely to complete it than a non-intervention comparison group.

Reporting Vaccine Errors: Two Publications A recent report, Recommendations to Practitioners to Prevent Vaccine Errors, Part 2: Analysis of ISMP VERP establishes nine top mistakes filed in the Vaccine Error Reporting Program (VERP) and provides detailed recommendations to avoid common vaccine errors. Providers may report any vaccine administration error and associated contributing factors to VERP at http://verp.ismp.org/ . A related study from the the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was published in the journal Vaccine . Of 2,100 vaccine errors reported, the most common error was \"inappropriate schedule.\" The vast majority (92%) were \"non -serious.\" The authors conclude that prevention strategies are needed.
