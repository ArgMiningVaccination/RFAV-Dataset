It detects a wide variety of agents, from [viruses](/index.php/Virus) to [parasitic worms](/index.php/Parasitic_worm), and needs to distinguish them from the organism's own healthy [cells](/index.php/Cell_(biology)) and [tissues](/index.php/Biological_tissue) in order to function properly. Detection is complicated as pathogens adapt and [evolve](/index.php?title=Evolution&action=edit&redlink=1) new ways to successfully infect the [host](/index.php/Host_(biology)) organism. To survive this challenge, several mechanisms evolved that recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple [unicellular](/index.php/Microorganism) organisms such as [bacteria](/index.php/Bacteria) possess [enzyme](/index.php/Enzyme) systems that protect against [viral](/index.php/Bacteriophage) infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient [eukaryotes](/index.php/Eukaryote) and remain in their modern descendants, such as [plants](/index.php/Plant), [fish](/index.php/Fish), [reptiles](/index.php/Reptile), and [insects](/index.php?title=Insect&action=edit&redlink=1). These [phagocytosis](/index.php/Phagocytosis), and the [complement system](/index.php/Complement_system). More sophisticated mechanisms, however, developed relatively recently, with the evolution of [vertebrates](/index.php/Vertebrate). [[1]](#cite_note-Beck-1) The immune systems of vertebrates such as [humans](/index.php/Human) consist of many types of [proteins](/index.php/Protein), cells, [organs](/index.php/Organ_(biology)), and tissues, which interact in an elaborate and dynamic network. As part of this more complex immune response, the vertebrate system adapts over time to recognize particular pathogens more efficiently. The adaptation process creates [immunological memories](/index.php/Immunity_(medical)) and allows even more effective protection during future encounters with these pathogens. This process of [acquired immunity](/index.php/Adaptive_immune_system) is the basis of [vaccination](/index.php/Vaccination). Disorders in the immune system can cause disease. [Immunodeficiency](/index.php/Immunodeficiency) diseases occur when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. Immunodeficiency can either be the result of a [genetic disease](/index.php/Genetic_disease), such as [severe combined immunodeficiency](/index.php/Severe_combined_immunodeficiency), or be produced by pharmaceuticals or an infection, such as the [acquired immune deficiency syndrome](/index.php/AIDS) (AIDS) that is caused by the [retrovirus](/index.php/Retrovirus) [HIV](/index.php/HIV). In contrast, [autoimmune](/index.php/Autoimmunity) diseases result from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include [rheumatoid arthritis](/index.php/Rheumatoid_arthritis), [diabetes mellitus type 1](/index.php/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1) and [lupus erythematosus](/index.php/Lupus_erythematosus). These critical roles of [immunology](/index.php/Immunology) in health and disease are areas of intense scientific study. Layered defense in immunity The immune system protects you from dying from [infection](/index.php/Infection) with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Most simply, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as [bacteria](/index.php/Bacteria) and [viruses](/index.php/Virus) from entering the body. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the [innate immune system](/index.php/Innate_immune_system) provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all [plants](/index.php/Plant) and [animals](/index.php?title=Animal&action=edit&redlink=1). [[2]](#cite_note-Litman-2) However, if pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a third layer of protection, the [adaptive immune system](/index.php/Adaptive_immune_system), which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an [immunological memory](/index.php/Immunological_memory), and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. [[3]](#cite_note-USC-3) innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self [molecules](/index.php/Molecule). In [immunology](/index.php/Immunology), self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. [[4]](#cite_note-4) Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called [antigens](/index.php/Antigen) (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific [immune receptors](/index.php/Immune_receptor) and elicit an immune response. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) Surface barriers Several barriers protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical and biological barriers. The waxy [cuticle](/index.php/Plant_cuticle) of many [leaves](/index.php/Leaf), the [exoskeleton](/index.php/Exoskeleton) of [insects](/index.php?title=Insect&action=edit&redlink=1), and membranes of externally deposited [eggs](/index.php/Egg_(biology)), and [skin](/index.php/Skin) are examples of the mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed against their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the [lungs](/index.php/Lung), [intestines](/index.php/Intestine), and the [genitourinary tract](/index.php/Genitourinary_system). In the lungs, [coughing](/index.php/Cough) and [sneezing](/index.php/Sneeze) mechanically eject pathogens and other [irritants](/index.php/Irritation) from the [respiratory tract](/index.php/Respiratory_tract). The flushing action of [urine](/index.php/Urine) also mechanically expels pathogens, while [mucus](/index.php/Mucus) secreted by the serves to trap and entangle [microorganisms](/index.php/Microorganism). [[6]](#cite_note-6) Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete [antimicrobial peptides](/index.php/Antimicrobial_peptides) such as the - [defensins](/index.php/Defensin). secretions serve as a chemical barrier following [menarche](/index.php/Menarche), when they become slightly [acidic](/index.php/Acid), while [semen](/index.php/Semen) contains defensins [gastric powerful chemical defenses pathogens. Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, [commensal](/index.php/Commensalism) [flora](/index.php/Gut_flora) serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as [pH](/index.php/PH) or available iron. [[12]](#cite_note-12) This reduces the probability that pathogens will be able to reach sufficient numbers to cause illness. However, since most [antibiotics](/index.php/Antibiotic) non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an \"overgrowth\" of [fungi](/index.php/Fungus) and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis ( [yeast infection](/index.php/Yeast_infection)). [[13]](#cite_note-13) There is good evidence that re-introduction of [probiotic](/index.php/Probiotic) flora, such as pure cultures of the [lactobacilli](/index.php/Lactobacillus) normally found in [yoghurt](/index.php?title=Yoghurt&action=edit&redlink=1), helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on [bacterial gastroenteritis](/index.php/Bacterial_gastroenteritis), [[16]](#cite_note-16) Innate immunity Microorganisms that successfully enter an organism will encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by [pattern recognition receptors](/index.php/Pattern_recognition_receptors), which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms. [[17]](#cite_note-pmid17943118-17) Innate immune defenses are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) This system does not confer long-lasting [immunity](/index.php/Immunity_(medical)) against a pathogen. The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms. [[2]](#cite_note-Litman-2) Humoral and chemical barriers Inflammation Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection. [[18]](#cite_note-18) The symptoms of inflammation are redness and swelling, which are caused by increased [blood](/index.php/Blood) flow into a tissue. Inflammation is produced by [eicosanoids](/index.php/Eicosanoid) and [cytokines](/index.php/Cytokine), which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include [prostaglandins](/index.php/Prostaglandin) that produce [fever](/index.php/Fever) and the [dilation](/index.php/Vasodilator) of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and [leukotrienes](/index.php/Leukotriene) that attract certain [white blood cells](/index.php/White_blood_cell) (leukocytes). [[19]](#cite_note-19) [[20]](#cite_note-20) Common cytokines include [interleukins](/index.php/Interleukin) are responsible for communication between white blood cells; [chemokines](/index.php/Chemokine) that promote [chemotaxis](/index.php/Chemotaxis); and [interferons](/index.php/Interferon) that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down [protein synthesis](/index.php/Protein_biosynthesis) in the host cell. [[21]](#cite_note-21) [Growth factors](/index.php/Growth_factor) and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens. [[22]](#cite_note-22) Complement system The complement system is a [biochemical cascade](/index.php/Biochemical_cascade) that attacks the surfaces of foreign cells. It contains over 20 different proteins and is named for its ability to \"complement\" the killing of pathogens by [antibodies](/index.php/Antibody). Complement is the major [humoral](/index.php/Humoral_immunity) component of the innate immune response. [[23]](#cite_note-Rus-23) [[24]](#cite_note-USCcomp-24) Many species have complement systems, including non- [mammals](/index.php?title=Mammal&action=edit&redlink=1) like plants, fish, and some [invertebrates](/index.php?title=Invertebrate&action=edit&redlink=1). [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) In humans, this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to [carbohydrates](/index.php/Carbohydrate) on the surfaces of [microbes](/index.php/Microbe). This recognition [signal](/index.php/Cell_signaling) triggers a rapid killing response. [[26]](#cite_note-26) The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential [proteolytic](/index.php/Proteolysis) activation of complement molecules, which are also [proteases](/index.php/Protease). After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a [catalytic](/index.php/Catalysis) cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled [positive feedback](/index.php/Positive_feedback). [[27]](#cite_note-27) The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase [vascular permeability](/index.php/Vascular_permeability), and [opsonize](/index.php/Opsonin) (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their [plasma membrane](/index.php/Cell_membrane). [[23]](#cite_note-Rus-23) Cellular barriers of the innate system Leukocytes ( [white blood cells](/index.php/White_blood_cell)) act like independent, single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) The innate leukocytes identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) Innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the [adaptive immune system](/index.php/Adaptive_immune_system). [[3]](#cite_note-USC-3) [Phagocytosis](/index.php/Phagocytosis) is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called ' [phagocytes](/index.php/Phagocyte)' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by [cytokines](/index.php/Cytokine). [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular [vesicle](/index.php/Vesicle_(biology)) called a [phagosome](/index.php/Phagosome), which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a [lysosome](/index.php/Lysosome) to form a [phagolysosome](/index.php/Phagolysosome). The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive [enzymes](/index.php/Enzyme) or following a [respiratory the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring [nutrients](/index.php/Nutrient), but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. [[30]](#cite_note-30) Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. [[31]](#cite_note-31) Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. [[32]](#cite_note-32) Neutrophils are normally found in the [bloodstream](/index.php/Circulatory_system) and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. [[33]](#cite_note-IandF-33) During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, [complement proteins](/index.php/Complement_system), and regulatory factors such as [interleukin 1](/index.php/Interleukin_1). [[34]](#cite_note-USCmac-34) Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as [antigen-presenting cells](/index.php/Antigen-presenting_cell) that activate the adaptive immune system. [[3]](#cite_note-USC-3) Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the [skin](/index.php/Skin), [nose](/index.php/Nose), [lungs](/index.php/Lung), [stomach](/index.php/Stomach), and [intestines](/index.php/Intestine). [[35]](#cite_note-Guermonprez-35) They are named for their resemblance to [neuronal](/index.php/Neuron) [dendrites](/index.php/Dendrite), as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the [nervous system](/index.php/Nervous_system). Dendritic cells serve as a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they [present antigen](/index.php/Antigen_presentation) to [T cells](/index.php/T_cell), one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system. [[35]](#cite_note-Guermonprez-35) Mast cells reside in [connective tissues](/index.php/Connective_tissue) and [mucous membranes](/index.php/Mucous_membrane), and regulate the inflammatory response. [[36]](#cite_note-36) They are most often associated with [allergy](/index.php/Allergy) and [anaphylaxis](/index.php/Anaphylaxis). [[33]](#cite_note-IandF-33) Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators that are involved in defending against [parasites](/index.php/Parasitism) and play a role in allergic reactions, such as [asthma](/index.php/Asthma). [[37]](#cite_note-37) Natural killer ( [NK cells](/index.php/NK_cells)) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy [tumor](/index.php/Tumor) cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses. [[38]](#cite_note-38) Adaptive immunity The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is \"remembered\" by a signature antigen. [[39]](#cite_note-39) The adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific \"non-self\" antigens during a process called [antigen presentation](/index.php/Antigen_presentation). Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by \"memory cells\". Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it. Lymphocytes The cells of the adaptive immune system are special types of leukocytes, called [lymphocytes](/index.php/Lymphocyte). [B cells](/index.php/B_cell) and [T cells](/index.php/T_cell) are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from [hematopoietic stem cells](/index.php/Hematopoietic_stem_cell) in the [bone marrow](/index.php/Bone_marrow). [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) B cells are involved in the [humoral immune response](/index.php/Humoral_immunity), whereas T cells are involved in [cell-mediated immune response](/index.php/Cell-mediated_immunity). Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a \"non-self\" target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a \"self\" receptor called a [major histocompatibility complex](/index.php/Major_histocompatibility_complex) (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes T cells: the [killer T cell](/index.php/Cytotoxic_T_cell) and the [helper T cell](/index.php/T_helper_cell). Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to [Class I MHC](/index.php/Major_histocompatibility_complex#MHC_class_I) molecules, while helper T cells only recognize antigens coupled to [Class II MHC](/index.php/Major_histocompatibility_complex#MHC_class_II) molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the [ T cells](/index.php/Gamma/delta_T_cells) that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors. [[40]](#cite_note-40) In contrast, the B cell antigen-specific receptor is an [antibody](/index.php/Antibody) molecule on the B cell surface, and recognizes whole pathogens without any need for [antigen processing](/index.php/Antigen_processing). Each lineage of B cell expresses a different antibody, so the complete set of B cell antigen receptors represent all the antibodies that the body can manufacture. [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) Killer T cells [Killer T cell](/index.php/Cytotoxic_T_cell) are a sub-group of T cells that kill cells infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. [[42]](#cite_note-42) As with B cells, each type of T cell recognises a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their [T cell receptor](/index.php/T_cell_receptor) (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a [co-receptor](/index.php/Co-receptor) on the T cell, called [CD8](/index.php/CD8). The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases [cytotoxins](/index.php/Cytotoxicity), such as [perforin](/index.php/Perforin), which form pores in the target cell's [plasma membrane](/index.php/Cell_membrane), allowing [ions](/index.php/Ion), water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called [granulysin](/index.php/Granulysin) (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. [[43]](#cite_note-Radoja-43) T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below). [[43]](#cite_note-Radoja-43) Helper T cells [Helper T cells](/index.php/T_helper_cell) regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses and help determine which types of immune responses the body will make to a particular pathogen. [[44]](#cite_note-44) [[45]](#cite_note-45) These cells have no cytotoxic activity and do not kill infected cells or clear pathogens directly. They instead control the immune response by directing other cells to perform these tasks. Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's [CD4](/index.php/CD4) co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g. [Lck](/index.php/Lck)) that are responsible for T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200-300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. [[46]](#cite_note-46) The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called [CD154](/index.php/CD154)), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells. [[47]](#cite_note-47) T cells [ T cells](/index.php/Gamma/delta_T_cells) possess an alternative [T cell receptor](/index.php/T_cell_receptor) (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ () T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as [CD1d](/index.php/CD1d_receptor)-restricted [Natural Killer T cells](/index.php/Natural_Killer_T_cell), T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. [[48]](#cite_note-48) On one hand, T cells are a component of [adaptive immunity](/index.php/Adaptive_immune_system) as they [rearrange TCR genes](/index.php/V(D)J_recombination) to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as [pattern recognition receptors](/index.php/Pattern_recognition_receptor). For example, large numbers of human V9/V2 T cells respond within hours to [common molecules](/index.php/Non-peptidic_antigen) produced by microbes, and highly restricted V1+ T cells in [epithelia](/index.php/Epithelium) will respond to stressed epithelial cells. [[49]](#cite_note-49) B lymphocytes and antibodies A [B cell](/index.php/B_cell) identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen. [[50]](#cite_note-Sproul-50) This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by [proteolysis](/index.php/Proteolysis) into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases [lymphokines](/index.php/Lymphokine) and activates the B cell. [[51]](#cite_note-51) As the activated B cell then begins to [divide](/index.php/Cell_division), its offspring ( [plasma cells](/index.php/Plasma_cells)) [secrete](/index.php/Secretion) millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and [lymph](/index.php/Lymphatic_system), bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by [complement activation](#Complement_system) or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells. [[52]](#cite_note-USCcells-52) [CD20](/index.php/CD20) antigen is also found on B lymphocytes. Alternative adaptive immune system Although the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g. antibodies and [T cell receptors](/index.php/T_cell_receptor)) exist only in jawed vertebrates, a distinct [lymphocyte](/index.php/Lymphocyte)-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive [jawless vertebrates](/index.php/Agnatha), such as the [lamprey](/index.php/Lamprey) and [hagfish](/index.php?title=Hagfish&action=edit&redlink=1). These animals possess a large array of molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of [genes](/index.php/Gene). These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic [antigens](/index.php/Antigen) in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity. [[53]](#cite_note-53) Immunological memory When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate, some of their offspring will become long-lived memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again. This is \"adaptive\" because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges. Immunological memory can either be in the form of passive short-term memory or active long-term memory. Passive memory Passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting between a few days and several months. Newborn [infants](/index.php/Infant) have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During [pregnancy](/index.php/Pregnancy), a particular type of antibody, called [IgG](/index.php/Immunoglobulin_G), is transported from mother to baby directly across the [placenta](/index.php/Placenta), so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. [[54]](#cite_note-54) [Breast milk](/index.php/Breast_milk) also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. [[55]](#cite_note-55) This is [passive immunity](/index.php/Passive_immunization) because the [fetus](/index.php/Fetus) does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies, it only borrows them. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be [transferred artificially](/index.php/Intravenous_immunoglobulin) from one individual to another via antibody-rich [serum](/index.php/Blood_plasma). [[56]](#cite_note-Keller-56) Active memory and immunization Long-term active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity can also be generated artificially, through [vaccination](/index.php/Vaccination). The principle behind vaccination (also called [immunization](/index.php/Immunization)) is to introduce an [antigen](/index.php/Antigen) from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed. [[57]](#cite_note-57) [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) Most viral [vaccines](/index.php/Vaccine) are based on live [attenuated](/index.php/Attenuator_(genetics)) viruses, while many bacterial vaccines are based on [acellular](/index.php/Non-cellular_life) components of micro-organisms, including harmless [toxin](/index.php/Toxin) components. [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional [adjuvants](/index.php/Immunologic_adjuvant) that activate the [antigen-presenting cells](/index.php/Antigen-presenting_cell) of the [innate immune system](#Innate_Immunity) and maximize [immunogenicity](/index.php/Immunogenicity). [[58]](#cite_note-58) Disorders of human immunity The immune system is a remarkably effective structure that incorporates specificity, inducibility and adaptation. Failures of host defense do occur, however, and fall into three broad categories: immunodeficiencies, autoimmunity, and hypersensitivities. Immunodeficiencies [Immunodeficiencies](/index.php/Immunodeficiency) occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the [elderly](/index.php/Old_age), with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to [immunosenescence](/index.php/Immunosenescence). [[59]](#cite_note-59) common causes of poor immune function. [[60]](#cite_note-nutrition-60) However, [malnutrition](/index.php/Malnutrition) is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in [developing countries](/index.php?title=Developing_country&action=edit&redlink=1). [[60]](#cite_note-nutrition-60) Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, [IgA](/index.php/Immunoglobulin_A) antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Deficiency of also reduces immune responses. [[60]](#cite_note-nutrition-60) Additionally, the loss of the [thymus](/index.php/Thymus) at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection. [[61]](#cite_note-61) Immunodeficiencies can also be inherited or ' [acquired'](/index.php/Immunodeficiency#Acquired_immune_deficiency). [[5]](#cite_note-Alberts-5) [Chronic granulomatous disease](/index.php/Chronic_granulomatous_disease), where [phagocytes](/index.php/Phagocyte) have a reduced ability to destroy pathogens, is an example of an inherited, or [congenital, immunodeficiency](/index.php/Primary_immunodeficiency). [AIDS](/index.php/AIDS) and some [[62]](#cite_note-62) [[63]](#cite_note-63) Autoimmunity Overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction, particularly the [autoimmune disorders](/index.php/Autoimmunity). Here, the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self, and attacks part of the body. Under normal circumstances, many T cells and antibodies react with \"self\" peptides. [[64]](#cite_note-64) One of the functions of specialized cells (located in the [thymus](/index.php/Thymus) and [bone marrow](/index.php/Bone_marrow)) is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens, preventing autoimmunity. [[50]](#cite_note-Sproul-50) Hypersensitivity [Hypersensitivity](/index.php/Hypersensitivity) is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I - IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or [anaphylactic](/index.php/Anaphylaxis) reaction, often associated with [allergy](/index.php/Allergy). Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by [IgE](/index.php/Immunoglobulin_E) released from [mast cells](/index.php/Mast_cell) and [basophils](/index.php/Basophil_granulocyte). [[65]](#cite_note-USCH-65) Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is complexes](/index.php/Immune_complex) (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. [[65]](#cite_note-USCH-65) Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve [contact dermatitis](/index.php/Contact_dermatitis) ( [poison ivy](/index.php/Poison_ivy)). [monocytes](/index.php/Monocyte), and [macrophages](/index.php/Macrophage). [[65]](#cite_note-USCH-65) Other mechanisms of host defense It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first [vertebrates](/index.php/Vertebrate), as [invertebrates](/index.php?title=Invertebrate&action=edit&redlink=1) do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. [[1]](#cite_note-Beck-1) Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the most structurally-simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the [restriction modification system](/index.php/Restriction_modification_system) to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called [bacteriophages](/index.php/Bacteriophage). [[66]](#cite_note-66) [Pattern recognition receptors](/index.php/Pattern_recognition_receptor) are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens. [Antimicrobial peptides](/index.php/Antimicrobial_peptides) called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants, and represent the main form of [invertebrate](/index.php?title=Invertebrate&action=edit&redlink=1) systemic [immunity](/index.php/Immunity_(medical)). [[1]](#cite_note-Beck-1) The [complement system](/index.php/Complement_system) and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life. [Ribonucleases](/index.php/Ribonuclease) and the [RNA interference](/index.php/RNA_interference) pathway are conserved across all [eukaryotes](/index.php/Eukaryote), and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses. [[67]](#cite_note-67) Unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, and most plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. [[68]](#cite_note-Plant-68) When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized [hypersensitive response](/index.php/Hypersensitive_response), whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid [apoptosis](/index.php/Apoptosis) to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. [Systemic acquired resistance](/index.php/Systemic_acquired_resistance) (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant [resistant](/index.php/Disease_resistance_in_fruit_and_vegetables) to a particular infectious agent. [[68]](#cite_note-Plant-68) [RNA silencing](/index.php/RNA_interference) mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication. [[69]](#cite_note-69) Tumor immunology Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate [tumors](/index.php/Tumor). The transformed cells of tumors express [antigens](/index.php/Antigen#tumor_antigens) that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; [[71]](#cite_note-anderson-71) some are derived from [oncogenic](/index.php/Oncogenic) viruses like [human papillomavirus](/index.php/Human_papillomavirus), which causes [cervical cancer](/index.php/Cervical_cancer), [[72]](#cite_note-72) while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an [enzyme](/index.php/Enzyme) called [tyrosinase](/index.php/Tyrosinase) that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. [melanocytes](/index.php/Melanocyte)) into tumors called [melanomas](/index.php/Melanoma). [[73]](#cite_note-73) [[74]](#cite_note-romera-74) A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating [cell growth](/index.php/Cell_growth) and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called [oncogenes](/index.php/Oncogene). [[71]](#cite_note-anderson-71) [[75]](#cite_note-guevara-75) [[76]](#cite_note-76) The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. [[74]](#cite_note-romera-74) [[77]](#cite_note-77) Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. [[78]](#cite_note-seliger-78) NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. [[79]](#cite_note-79) Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the [complement system](/index.php/Complement_system). [[75]](#cite_note-guevara-75) Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers. [[80]](#cite_note-selig-80) Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. [[78]](#cite_note-seliger-78) Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine [TGF-](/index.php/TGF_beta), which suppresses [lymphocytes](/index.php/Lymphocyte). In addition, [immunological tolerance](/index.php/Immune_tolerance) may develop against tumor antigens, so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells. [[80]](#cite_note-selig-80) Paradoxically, macrophages can promote tumor growth [[82]](#cite_note-82) when tumor cells send out cytokines that attract macrophages which then generate cytokines and growth factors that nurture tumor development. In addition, a combination of hypoxia in the tumor and a cytokine produced by macrophages induces tumor cells to decrease production of a protein that blocks [metastasis](/index.php/Metastasis) and thereby assists spread of cancer cells. Physiological regulation [Hormones](/index.php/Hormone) can act as [immunomodulators](/index.php/Immunomodulators), altering the sensitivity of the immune system. For example, [female sex hormones](/index.php/Female_sex_hormones) are known [immunostimulators](/index.php/Immunostimulator) of both adaptive [[83]](#cite_note-83) and innate immune responses. [[84]](#cite_note-84) Some autoimmune diseases such as [lupus erythematosus](/index.php/Lupus_erythematosus) strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with [puberty](/index.php/Puberty). By contrast, [male sex hormones](/index.php/Androgen) such as [testosterone](/index.php/Testosterone) seem to be [immunosuppressive](/index.php/Immunosuppressive). [[85]](#cite_note-85) Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably [prolactin](/index.php/Prolactin), [growth hormone](/index.php/Growth_hormone) and [vitamin D](/index.php/Vitamin_D). [[86]](#cite_note-86) [[87]](#cite_note-87) It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. [[88]](#cite_note-88) Conversely, some hormones are regulated by the immune system, notably [thyroid hormone](/index.php/Thyroid_hormone) activity. [[89]](#cite_note-89) The immune system is enhanced by sleep and rest, [[90]](#cite_note-90) and is impaired by stress. [[91]](#cite_note-91) Diet may affect the immune system; for example, fresh [fruits](/index.php/Fruit), [vegetables](/index.php/Vegetable), and foods rich in certain [fatty acids](/index.php/Fatty_acid) may foster a healthy immune system. [[92]](#cite_note-92) Likewise, [fetal undernourishment](/index.php/Prenatal_development) can cause a lifelong impairment of the immune system. [[93]](#cite_note-93) In [traditional medicine](/index.php/Traditional_medicine), some herbs are believed to stimulate the immune as as well as [honey](/index.php?title=Honey&action=edit&redlink=1). Studies have suggested that such herbs can indeed stimulate the immune system, [[94]](#cite_note-94) although their mode of action is complex and difficult to characterize. Manipulation in medicine The immune response can be manipulated to suppress unwanted responses resulting from autoimmunity, allergy, and [transplant rejection](/index.php/Transplant_rejection), and to stimulate protective responses against pathogens that largely elude the immune system (see [immunization](#Active_memory_&_immunization)). [Immunosuppressive drugs](/index.php/Immunosuppressive_drug) are used to control autoimmune disorders or [inflammation](/index.php/Inflammation) when excessive tissue damage occurs, and to prevent [transplant rejection](/index.php/Transplant_rejection) after an [organ transplant](/index.php/Organ_transplant). [[25]](#cite_note-Janeway6-25) [[95]](#cite_note-Taylor-95) [Anti-inflammatory](/index.php/Anti-inflammatory) drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation. The [glucocorticoids](/index.php/Glucocorticoid) are the most powerful of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects (e.g., [central obesity](/index.php/Central_obesity), [hyperglycemia](/index.php/Hyperglycemia), [osteoporosis](/index.php/Osteoporosis)) and their use must be tightly controlled. [[96]](#cite_note-96) Therefore, lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with [cytotoxic](/index.php/Cytotoxicity) or [immunosuppressive drugs](/index.php/Immunosuppressive_drug) such as [methotrexate](/index.php/Methotrexate) or [azathioprine](/index.php/Azathioprine). [Cytotoxic drugs](/index.php/Chemotherapy) inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other organs and cell types are affected, which causes toxic side effects. [[95]](#cite_note-Taylor-95) Immunosuppressive drugs such as [cyclosporin](/index.php/Cyclosporin) prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting [signal transduction](/index.php/Signal_transduction) pathways. [[97]](#cite_note-97) Larger drugs (>500 [Da](/index.php/Atomic_mass_unit)) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for [Taxol](/index.php/Paclitaxel). Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that [hydrophilic](/index.php/Hydrophile) [amino acids](/index.php/Amino_acid) are overrepresented in epitope regions than [hydrophobic](/index.php/Hydrophobe) [[98]](#cite_note-Welling-98) however, more recent developments rely on [machine learning](/index.php/Machine_learning) techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a [training set](/index.php/Training_set). [[99]](#cite_note-Sollner-99) A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. [[100]](#cite_note-Saha-100) The emerging field of [bioinformatics](/index.php/Bioinformatics)-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. [[101]](#cite_note-Flower-101) Manipulation by pathogens The success of any pathogen is dependent on its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens have developed several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading immune-mediated destruction. [[102]](#cite_note-Finlay-102) Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting [enzymes](/index.php/Enzyme) that digest the barrier \u2014 for example, by using a type II secretion system. [[103]](#cite_note-103) Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, which provides a direct conduit for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host; the proteins transported along the tube are often used to shut down host defenses. [[104]](#cite_note-104) An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to circumvent the innate immune system is intracellular replication (also called [intracellular](/index.php/Intracellular) [pathogenesis](/index.php/Pathogenesis)). Here, a pathogen spends a majority of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the [food poisoning](/index.php/Foodborne_illness) as [Mycobacterium tuberculosis](/index.php/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis), live inside a protective capsule that prevents [lysis](/index.php/Lysis) by complement. [[105]](#cite_note-105) Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. [[102]](#cite_note-Finlay-102) Some bacteria form [biofilms](/index.php/Biofilm) to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic [Pseudomonas aeruginosa](/index.php/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa) and [Burkholderia cenocepacia](/index.php/Burkholderia_cenocepacia) infections characteristic of [cystic fibrosis](/index.php/Cystic_fibrosis). [[106]](#cite_note-106) Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include [Streptococcus](/index.php/Streptococcus) (protein G), [Staphylococcus aureus](/index.php/Staphylococcus_aureus) (protein A), and [Peptostreptococcus magnus](/index.php/Peptostreptococcus) (protein L). [[107]](#cite_note-107) The mechanisms used by viruses to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential [epitopes](/index.php/Epitope) ( [amino acids](/index.php/Amino_acid) and/or sugars) on the invader's surface, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. HIV, for example, regularly mutates the proteins on its [viral envelope](/index.php/Viral_envelope) that are essential for entry into its host target cell. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of [vaccines](/index.php/Vaccine) directed at these proteins. [[108]](#cite_note-108) Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the [viron](/index.php/Virus) is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\". [[109]](#cite_note-109) History of immunology [Immunology](/index.php/Immunology) is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from [medicine](/index.php/Medicine) and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known mention of immunity was during the [plague of Athens](/index.php/Plague_of_Athens) in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. [[110]](#cite_note-110) This observation of acquired immunity was later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of [vaccination](/index.php/Vaccination) and his proposed [germ theory of disease](/index.php/Germ_theory_of_disease). [[111]](#cite_note-111) Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the [miasma theory](/index.php/Miasma_theory_of_disease). It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 [proofs](/index.php/Koch%27s_postulates), for which he was awarded a [Nobel Prize](/index.php/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine) in 1905, that [microorganisms](/index.php/Microorganism) were confirmed as the cause of [infectious disease](/index.php/Infectious_disease). [[112]](#cite_note-112) Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the [yellow fever](/index.php/Yellow_fever) virus by Walter Reed. [[113]](#cite_note-113) Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of [humoral immunity](/index.php/Humoral_immunity) and [cellular immunity](/index.php/Cellular_immunity). [[114]](#cite_note-Metch-114) Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the [side-chain theory](/index.php/Side-chain_theory) to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, [Elie Metchnikoff](/index.php/Elie_Metchnikoff).
