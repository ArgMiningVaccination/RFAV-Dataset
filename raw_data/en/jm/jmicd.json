Naturopathic Medical Director While eating a nutritious diet and exercising regularly can help you maintain good health, toxins can still build up in the body. A \"cleanse\" or \"detox\" may help remove these harmful toxins to support overall health Although a cleanse can be done any time of year, many people choose spring and fall. It's common to develop poor eating habits during the summer and winter months when there are tasty temptations everywhere. A diet-based cleanse can help reset the body and improve your metabolism. With a cleanse, you're going back to the basics by removing foods known to cause inflammation in the body. Resetting the digestive system takes approximately three weeks, in which time the immune system settles and can protect not only the gut but the rest of the body. Importance of Cleansing in the Fall A cleanse or detox provides an opportunity to reevaluate your eating habits, recharge your physical and mental health, and rejuvenate your body as a whole. Some of the key benefits of performing a fall cleanse include: - Remove toxins from the body - Support liver function and digestive health - Increase physical activity and energy levels - Support your immune system - Experience greater mental clarity Guidelines to Perform a Fall Cleanse Cleanses should be developed to meet the unique needs of each individual. However, there are some general guidelines that you can follow in relation to your dietary habits, exercise routine, and sleep habits. These include: 1. Eliminate foods that can lead to inflammation. This includes foods like sugar, high-mercury fish, dairy, eggs, gluten, corn, red meat, tomatoes, soy, alcohol, and coffee. If you have other known food sensitivities, avoid these during your cleanse. In addition, you want to increase your fiber intake to keep your bowels regular. 2. Become more active. It is important to remain active during a cleanse to ensure that the toxins being released from fat cells in storage are properly removed from the body. This involves increasing circulation and your metabolism through regular workouts. Aim for 1 hour of activity daily. These could include working out at the gym, running jogging, walking, or simply moving doing the activities you enjoy. 3. Reduce stress. While stress is a normal part of life, too much stress can slow down the metabolism and block thyroid hormones. Try a variety of stress-relieving techniques to see what works for you. Examples include reading, meditation, yoga, journaling, or going for leisurely walks. 4. Get enough sleep. It is important to maintain a healthy sleep schedule to allow ample time for your body to re-energize and recharge. Ideally, you want to avoid screens for at least one hour before bed. Relax in a dark room to help build up the hormone melatonin which can help you get a good night's rest. 5. Incorporate supplements into your daily diet. Drink a detox smoothie once or twice per day to get the vitamins, minerals, and herbs you need to improve liver function and break down harmful toxins. Recommended herbs include curcumin, artichoke, milk thistle, dandelion roots, and burdock. Schedule a Consultation with Vitalia Celebrate the shift from summer to fall by cleansing the body.
